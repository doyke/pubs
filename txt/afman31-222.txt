                            UNDERSTANDING USE OF FORCE
1.1. USAF Use of Force Policy. All Air Force personnel engaged in law enforcement, security
and force protection duties will use only that force which is reasonably necessary in conformity
with the statutes and Constitution of the United States. Personnel must avoid use of force where
it‘s not essential to carrying out assigned responsibilities. At times, Air Force personnel may
need to use force to perform assigned duties. Such use of force will be appropriate provided they
operate within the law, Air Force policies, guidance, and have received appropriate training in its
application. This manual was designed to assist in training on specific use of force techniques.
   1.1.1. Cases Warranting Use of Force. In cases warranting use of force, personnel must use
   only that force reasonably necessary to reach the objective. Tailor the type and level of force
   to its necessity. You must base your use of force option on the actions of the individual(s)
   with whom you are in contact. Once a particular level of force is no longer required,
   discontinue its use despite the fact a suspect‘s efforts to thwart or evade a seizure may arouse
   normal passions of anger, fear, or frustration.
   1.1.2. Objective Reasonableness. The criteria supporting ―objective reasonableness‖ is
   provided from three essential areas within the confrontational environment: The subject(s)
   action(s), officer perception, and the officer response(s) initiated in order to gain compliance
   and control. NOTE: Refer to paragraph 1.4 of AFI 31-207 for a more detail explanation.
1.2. Use of Force Introduction. Air Force personnel engaged in the protection of personnel and
resources have the authority to use firearms and intermediate weapons to employ force on
subjects. Before using force, Air Force personnel are obligated to possess the knowledge and
skills necessary to assess acts or threats and respond in a reasonable manner. These objective
principles enable Air Force personnel to make timely and reasonable judgments that support the
paramount consideration of their safety and the safety and security of personnel and resources
they are protecting. The decision to use force can have grave consequences that may result in
injury or death. Once force is employed, that force is irreversible. In addition, hesitancy or
inaction when force is necessary may be devastating. Accordingly, this section of the manual
discusses mental preparedness, basic principles of the use of force, the Use of Force Model
(UFM), the tools and tactics available within the USAF, and unified training principles.
   1.2.1. Mental Preparedness. Many factors play a critical role in a person‘s mental state
   affecting his/her ability to react without hesitation to a perceived threat or to resistance.
   Learned behavior, social norms, and societal expectations all influence the person, not
   necessarily only professionally, but personally as well. It is difficult for a person to
   immediately strike or cause the dysfunction, injury, or death of another person in an attempt
   to stop their actions when the first person has been raised to believe it is wrong and is
   grudgingly acceptable only in self-defense. It is also difficult for a person not to hesitate in
   employing force when the perception is that force utilization is only a last resort option and
   then only when all lesser means have been exhausted. This perception is manifested through
   improper training, legal misunderstanding, poor understanding of policy, the belief of endless
   lawsuits, and media persecution. When directly involved in a use of force incident, most
   people have physiological changes in their body that inherently occur during or immediately
10                                                  AFMAN31-222           18 FEBRUARY 2009

after their objective perception of a threat. For example, the production of fear or exhaustion
may cause negative effects in vision, motor skill performance, and cognitive processing. The
combination of all these factors could lead the person to be ineffective in force utilization.
The objective then becomes to minimize or effectively resolve these factors by ensuring
personnel fully understand why they are affected and how they can take steps to minimize or
resolve them.
     1.2.2. Personal Beliefs. Personnel must resolve personal issues within themselves such
     as commitment to mission, mortality, and willingness to sacrifice.
            1.2.2.1. They have to be mentally prepared for the probability of having to stop
            someone knowing that as a result of their actions, injury or death could be a
            logical consequence. This is critical considering the almost universal aversion of
            interpersonal aggression common to most people. Many personnel fear becoming
            the victim of close-range aggression but an even greater fear is that of inflicting
            injury or death through aggression or the use of force. Ultimately both fears can
            cause tentativeness and hesitation.
            1.2.2.2. Personnel must be mentally prepared to enter a situation where they may
            be injured. Many personnel never consider the possibility of being in a physical
            confrontation of any significance. Therefore, when it occurs, they are totally
            unprepared mentally. Many of these confrontations involve attacks with the
            probability of serious physical injury or death. Of these, there are only two
            outcomes: death or survival. Personnel must possess the ability and awareness to
            recognize dangerous situations and take immediate actions to stop the threat.
            When the person is mentally prepared, survival is not an issue and the focus is on
            winning. A person can win any situation or dangerous encounter if they believe
            in themselves, have the will to survive, and are mentally and physically prepared.
            1.2.2.3. Personnel must understand that the use of force is not a defensive act; it is
            an act of offense (not to be confuse with defensive tactics). Although the use of
            force itself is an offensive act, many defensive situations demand an officer to use
            offensive techniques in order to adequately defend themselves or others. In force
            utilization, personnel are required to take action to stop or control a subject‘s
            action or noncompliance using an offensive tactic to gain control or compliance.
            Striking an assailant with a baton is an offensive action. Shooting an assailant
            attacking with a weapon is an offensive action. On the other end of the use of
            force spectrum, using restraint applications, such as handcuffing, is also utilizing
            offensive force to control the subject. Training and policy often focus on training
            that involves blocking or avoiding physical assaults. This type of training may
            avoid a specific action but it does not train personnel to stop the subject.
            Personnel should immediately stop the subject‘s actions and obtain control or
            compliance. Although personnel should recognize defensive measures, effective
            defensive tactics within all force utilization requires an offensive response.
            Mentally placing themselves on the defensive, using defensive tools, and
            defending against attacks automatically places personnel at a disadvantage. This
            type of defensive perception only enables acts of hesitation, ineffectiveness, and
            negative stress performance caused by the sympathetic nervous system. It is
            critical for personnel to understand they must be proactive and react to the threat
AFMAN31-222         18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                   11

              of violence, not the actual violence itself. The only way to do this effectively is to
              be on the action side of an incident instead of on the reaction side.
  1.2.3. Exhaustion of Alternatives Not Required. A person‘s ability to react without
  hesitation to a perceived threat or to resistance requires changing the perception that the use of
  force is only a last resort and should be used only when all lesser means have been exhausted.
  This perception is manifested through improper training, legal misunderstanding, poor
  understanding of policy, the belief of endless lawsuits, and media persecution.
      1.2.3.1. The legal standard of reasonableness does not require personnel to select the least
      intrusive alternative, only a reasonable option based on the situation. When reasonable
      use of force is not applied immediately to gain compliance, a domino effect occurs where
      circumstances of the incident become more dangerous, out of control, or unmanageable.
      1.2.3.2. The complexity of the decision and assessment increases, especially with the
      person‘s perception of a threat, and the person‘s ability to determine a reasonable force
      option quickly and efficiently erodes. When force utilization is applied immediately and
      without hesitation that force application results in fewer injuries because the incident is
      quickly ended and control is established.
  1.2.4. General Rule. Normally, force is to be used only as a last resort, and the force used
  should be the minimum necessary. When time and circumstances permit, an individual(s)
  who appears to be a threat should be warned and given the opportunity to withdraw or cease
  threatening actions, as appropriate and consistent with the lawful objectives or mission
  requirements of the officer/sentry. Law enforcement or security personnel may have an
  obligation to apprehend rather than permit an individual to withdraw. Deadly force is to be
  used only when all lesser means have failed or cannot reasonably be employed. In some
  circumstances, force, including deadly force, may be the only option available to respond to a
  hostile act or hostile intent. The use of force must be reasonable in intensity, duration, and
  magnitude based on the totality of the circumstances to counter the threat.
      1.2.4.1. Knowing and understanding the constitutional standards in determining
      reasonable use of force and the Air Force Use of Force policy is an essential element of
      mental preparation. When personnel are confident that using force is justified in a given
      situation, they are mentally prepared to win and to act with competency. Hesitancy or
      inaction because of legal ignorance and/or restrictive policy may have a negative
      outcome in use of force situations. Any delay in the decision making process could result
      in the failure to adequately neutralize the threat, which could lead to injury or death.
  1.2.5. Physiological Factors. When faced with a threat, personnel need to understand that
  certain physiological changes occur in the body when the sympathetic nervous system is
  triggered. These triggers may include, but are not limited to: fear of death, fear of injury, fear
  of killing, fear of failure, fear of the unknown, extreme physical exhaustion, lack of
  confidence in abilities, experiencing a highly emotional event, being in close proximity to the
  threat; and experiencing unexpected impact touch.
      1.2.5.1. When personnel are under stress caused by these triggers, especially stress that is
      caused by the perception of death or bodily harm, the person‘s sympathetic nervous
      system initiates a defense mechanism referred to as the ―fight‖ or ―flight‖ response(s).
      These responses are preparing the body for the survival reactions of fight or flight. In
  12                                                  AFMAN31-222          18 FEBRUARY 2009

       addition to fight or flight, another possible response that could be manifested is the
       ―tachy-psyche effect.‖ The ―tachy-psyche‖ response is the most critical because it has to
       do with ―freezing‖ and renders the person incapable of proper action or reaction to the
       situation at hand.
       1.2.5.2. Once the sympathetic nervous system is triggered, the person experiences
       negative effects in visual processing, motor skill performance, and cognitive processing.
       The negative effects in these three areas are the inability to focus with the dominant eye,
       night vision degradation, inability to distinguish colors, loss of depth perception, loss of
       peripheral vision, loss of near vision, involuntary tracking of the threat, increase of
       adrenalin production, increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, increased
       respiration, deterioration of fine motor and gross motor skills, auditory exclusion, lack of
       clarity of thought, or irrational responses.
1.3. Use of Force Model (UFM). The UFM (Figure 1.1.) is adopted from the Federal Law
Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) training curriculum on use of force. The FLETC UFM
incorporates the three elements the U.S. Supreme Court identified as critical in the determination
of the ―objective reasonableness‖ of force utilization. These elements are incorporated into the
three facets of the UFM. The reasonable officer‘s perception of the situation (Officer
Perception) and the officer‘s perception of the suspect‘s actions (Subject Action) should
determine the officer‘s selected force response (Officer Response). NOTE: The UFM is a tool
to help understand the use of force and how force is applied. It does not take the place of
objective reasonableness when applying force.
Figure 1.1. Use of Force Model
AFMAN31-222         18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                    13

  1.3.1. UFM Color Correlation. As is evident, color is a significant component of the UFM.
  The colors (blue, green, yellow, orange, and red) were drawn from the scientifically supported
  sequencing of the basic light spectrum and provide for specific color correlation throughout
  the UFM.
      1.3.1.1. Blue – The officer is engaged in duties with an occupationally produced
      perception of responsibilities and risks. The broad foundation of the UFM is represented
      by the baseline of the color-keyed assessment spectrum.
      1.3.1.2. Green – The officer perceives a level of noncompliance within the
      confrontational environment, evolving into the deployment of tactics.
      1.3.1.3. Yellow – The officer perceives the situation escalating and the level of
      noncompliance has increased. This color indicates an activated level of alertness and
      caution.
      1.3.1.4. Orange – The perception of danger has accelerated for the officer and there is a
      more directed focus on officer safety and defense.
      1.3.1.5. Red – The potentially lethal degree of risk is the most infrequent, and yet the
      most critical for officer safety and survival. The highest level on the UFM correlates to
      the most intense color in the threat assessment spectrum, red.
  1.3.2. Control Superiority Principle. As one looks at each level of the UFM, it is evident
  that the color of the Officer Response side of the UFM is brighter or more intense. This
  increase in color intensity is used to facilitate the principle that the officer is always superior
  to the subject‘s degree of compliance/noncompliance in terms of controlled and balanced
  force utilization.
  1.3.3. Officer Assessment/Selection Arrows. The double-headed arrows are used to indicate
  the dynamic nature of an officer‘s decision-making process during an enforcement encounter.
  During a confrontation, the subject may escalate, stabilize or de-escalate his/her degree of
  noncompliance. Therefore, the officer must be able to practice flexibility in force responses
  that match the threat or subject‘s actions based on the UFM.
  1.3.4. Survival Shadow. The officer assessment and selection arrows are bordered with a red
  line to indicate that the officer‘s occupation is of high risk. The officer must be constantly
  reminded that imminent danger that may cause death and/or serious physical injury can occur
  at any time.
  1.3.5. Progression or De-escalation of Force. The primary goal of the officer‘s effort is to
  gain and maintain control of the subject. Ideally, each enforcement encounter results in a
  ―balance‖ utilization of force flowing in the form of escalation, stabilization, or de-escalation.
  The utilization of force is based upon the actions or threats presented and the subject‘s degree
  of compliance or noncompliance. The application of force during an officer/subject encounter
  should be based primarily on the perceived actions of the suspect within the totality of the
  circumstances and not on the actor(s) with whom you are dealing. An officer‘s response to a
  subject‘s perceived actions must be guided by objective reasonableness when effecting
  control.
  1.3.6. Officer Perception. The ―reasonableness‖ of a particular use of force must be judged
  from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene rather than with the 20/20 vision of
14                                                  AFMAN31-222          18 FEBRUARY 2009

hindsight. Its calculus must embody an allowance for the fact that officers are often forced to
make split-second decisions about the amount of force necessary in a particular situation. The
Fourth Amendment standard of ―reasonableness‖ is not conducive to ―precise definition or
mechanical application;‖ however, objectively reasonable can be simplified into three
rudimentary elements for the purpose of promoting understanding only. The elements of
objective reasonableness are not standards of law. The elements or reasonableness are
depicted in the center of the UFM through the shadow of a triangle. Each element is based on
the officer‘s perception of the subject‘s actions. Each element is expressly linked to the other
with all three elements required to be present to establish the basis of reasonableness in force
utilization. The three elements are:
     1.3.6.1. Ability-Capability. This element addresses the ability-capability of the subject to
     carry out a threatened action. It is highly unlikely a subject who has no use of their arms
     and legs could carry out a threat of physical battery due to his/her physical incapability.
     Thus the ability to carry out any act or threat professed must be logical. There does not
     need to be any verbalization with an action to show the ability or capability but the
     officer must perceive the person proposing the action or threat is capable of performing
     the action. If a person pulls out a knife and wields it towards an officer, the officer does
     not have to ask if the subject is capable nor does the subject have to tell the officer the
     intended action. The officer sees the subject who has a knife and perceives the person is
     capable of carrying out a threat with a cutting instrument based on logic, training, and
     experience. Remember the mere presence of a weapon does not necessarily constitute
     intent but can definitely indicate a subject‘s ability-capability.
     1.3.6.2. Opportunity. This element indicates the action or threat the officer perceives is
     imminent, but not necessarily instantaneous. The subject must be in a position where
     he/she can use their ability-capability to carry out the act or threat. For example, if a
     subject armed with a baseball bat verbalizes harm towards an officer, but they are
     standing two feet from each other and are separated by a 1-mile wide, 15-foot tall chain-
     link fence, the subject clearly lacks the opportunity to carry out the threat even though
     he/she has the ability-capability.
     1.3.6.3. Intent. This is the mental state that a subject had a particular purpose in mind
     when engaging in a given conduct. For example, if an able-bodied subject within range
     of an apprehending officer reaches for a firearm the subject has shown intent to inflict
     harm on the apprehending officer. Intent is often depicted by an overt act in furtherance
     of a crime or threat.
     1.3.6.4. The elements of reasonableness do not apply only to the individual officer who is
     faced with an attack. In other words, the elements of reasonableness apply to all uses of
     force and not just those where the officer is in jeopardy. The concept of the elements of
     reasonableness assists the officer in determining force escalation justification but
     ultimately it defines the basis of reasonableness of the officer‘s response when applied
     within the totality of the circumstances of each specific incident. The officer must
     remember that no element can stand alone or be the sole basis for the use of force. All
     three elements must be perceived in determining the reasonableness of an officer‘s action
     to employ or escalate force.
AFMAN31-222         18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                    15

  1.3.7. Subject Action. The left side of the UFM identifies the five subject action levels judged
  from the ―perspective of the reasonable officer,‖ with circumstances that are tense, uncertain,
  and/or rapidly evolving.
      1.3.7.1. Compliant (Cooperative).      This level represents the vast majority of
      officer/subject encounters. At this level, the likelihood of physical response by the
      subject is minimal.
      1.3.7.2. Resistant (Passive). The subject exhibits the preliminary level of noncompliance
      and requires some degree of physical contact in order to obtain compliance. For
      example, a subject verbally refuses to go with an officer following a lawful apprehension.
      In this example, the subject offers no physical or mechanical enhancement towards the
      resistance effort other than to stand motionless or remain seated.
      1.3.7.3. Resistant (Active). The scope and intensity of the subject‘s resistance has
      increased. The subject is exhibiting physical or mechanical defiance to the officer‘s
      control. For example, during an apprehension, the subject turns and walks away from the
      officer, or the subject tries to not allow the officer to perform compliance techniques or
      use restraints, but, is not aggressive towards the officer in any way. The subject is using
      physical energy to establish defiance although directed away from the officer. The
      subject would be perceived at the resistant (active) level because he/she is using force
      and/or energy to maintain resistance.
      1.3.7.4. Assaultive (Physical Injury). The officer has the perception of an attack or the
      potential for such an attack on the officer or others. The officer makes the reasonable
      assessment that such actions by the subject would not result in death or serious physical
      injury to the officer or others. For example, while attempting a lawful apprehension, the
      subject walks away from the officer after being given verbal commands to stop, then
      suddenly turns and runs toward the officer with clenched fists. In this example, the officer
      could easily have the perception that the individual intends to assault the officer.
      1.3.7.5. Assaultive (Serious Physical Injury/Death). This highest level of noncompliance
      is the least encountered but poses the most serious threat to officer safety. The officer‘s
      objectively reasonable assessment is that such assaultive actions by the subject could
      result in death or serious physical injury to the officer or others. For example, an armed
      subject is holding hostages in a barricade situation, and threatens to kill innocent victims
      if his/her demands are not met. In this scenario, if the subject is not stopped, innocent
      citizens and officers could be seriously injured or killed.
  1.3.8. Officer Response. The right side of the UFM identifies the five officer response levels.
  It should be noted that any response from the lower level can be utilized at any of the above
  levels if selected by the officer, but the ―reasonableness‖ does not require officers to select the
  least intrusive alternative -- only a reasonable one.
      1.3.8.1. Cooperative Controls. This level includes methods to preserve officer safety and
      survival. It includes officer presence, verbal commands, restraint applications, position
      strategies, etc. It is important to recognize that the cooperative controls can also be used
      at all levels within the UFM in addition to those tools identified throughout the UFM;
      they are not required when presented with a higher threat level. For instance, verbal
  16                                                  AFMAN31-222          18 FEBRUARY 2009

       commands can be used in an assaultive confrontation by telling the subject to stop, get
       down, etc.
       1.3.8.2. Contact Controls. When confronted with a subject demonstrating resistant
       behavior, the officer uses physical tactics to gain control and compliance. These tactics
       can be psychologically manipulative as well as physical, and can include additional
       verbal persuasion skills, relative positioning strategies, touch pressure points and escort
       positions. For example, if a subject who is to be placed under apprehension refuses to
       comply with the lawful orders of the officer, but remains at the lowest end on the
       resistance scale and is passive in his/her refusal, the officer would most likely respond
       with an escort hold. The officer may also wait for backup officers and show strength in
       numbers.
       1.3.8.3. Compliance Techniques. When the subject becomes actively resistant, the
       officer uses physical control tactics. These tactics should be of sufficient force to
       overcome the active resistance of the subject and the officer should remain vigilant for
       more aggressive behavior from the subject.          Examples include pressure point
       applications, takedowns, head de-stabilization, TASER, and pepper spray.
       1.3.8.4. Defensive Tactics. At this level, the subject attempts or achieves an assault on
       the officer or another person. The officer is justified in using defensive/offensive tactics
       designed to stop the subject‘s non-lethal assault on the officer or others, regain control,
       and assure continued compliance. These tactics could include baton strikes, empty hand
       strikes, etc.
       1.3.8.5. Deadly Force. When the officer perceives that the subject of such force poses the
       potential for death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person,
       immediate officer response must be used to stop the threat. These tactics could include
       the use of a firearm or baton. If the use of deadly force is justified the implement used is
       of no consequence.
1.4. Tools, Tactics, and Timing. Application of force encompasses three main elements of
action and assessment. These elements are tools, tactics, and timing.
    1.4.1. Tools. Tools are the mechanical, physical or mental resources we have in order to
    promote or gain compliance. These include verbal skills, control techniques, non-lethal
    weapons, intermediate weapons, lethal weapons, and survival mind-set.
    1.4.2. Tactics. Tactics are the applications of these tools in the form of techniques and
    procedures. The officer must incorporate the tools into strategies to accomplish an
    apprehension, such as keeping a subject‘s hands/palms visible at all times and the proper use
    of cover or concealment.
    1.4.3. Timing. Timing is the correlation of tools and tactics to produce the timely and
    effective application of the appropriate level of force required to establish and maintain
    lawful control. An example is when an officer applies handcuffs during an apprehension in
    order to maintain order to minimize the potential of an assault on the officer.
1.5. Applying Force with the Appropriate Tool/Tactic. The following are examples of tactics
available to Air Force personnel based on the subject‘s actions, officer perception, and the
officer‘s response. This is not an all inclusive listing and other methods are available.
AFMAN31-222        18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                 17

      1.5.2.3. Wrist elbow position.
      1.5.2.4. Hand rotation position.
  1.5.3. Compliance Techniques. Tools available at the third level (Compliance Techniques)
  besides those available in the first and second include:
      1.5.3.1. Neuromuscular controls.
      1.5.3.2. Chemical irritant application.
      1.5.3.3. Baton used as leverage devices or in pain compliance role (non-striking).
      1.5.3.4. TASER application.
      1.5.3.5. MWD on guard/on leash.
      1.5.3.6. Pressure point control techniques.

      warding off or countering the subject assault.
      1.5.4.3. Impact Weapons: To include the baton or asp as well as anything at hand for use
      in defense or gaining control of the subject. Blocks, strikes, and jabs to proper target
      areas would be justified. Proper target areas include arms, legs, and back.
      1.5.4.4. Weapon retention.
18                                                  AFMAN31-222           18 FEBRUARY 2009

     1.5.4.5. MWD on or off leash, bite and hold.
     1.5.5. Deadly Force. Tools available at the fifth level (Deadly Force) include those
     outlined in Levels I-IV and firearms.
1.5.6. Four Noted Tactical Issues. When posted in direct support of Protection Level 1
nuclear weapons/components, Security Forces must be able to quickly identify, assess, and
counter hostile attempts to gain unauthorized access to nuclear weapons/components. This
specialized training is important due to the size of the published Nuclear Postulated Threat
(NPT), as defined in DoD S-5210.41M, Nuclear Weapons Security Manual, and the limited
delay/denial technologies in place to prevent unauthorized access to stored nuclear
weapons/components or those in maintenance status.
      1.5.6.1. The principal tactical focus in the enforcement environment is to continue to
      promote and practice the confrontation equation. By definition, the confrontation
      equation is simply the officer remaining in a constant position of recognizable
      advantage within any confrontation, while the subject stays in a continued position of
      recognizable disadvantage. One vivid and viable illustration of this tactical equation is
      the practice of the 2 on 1 advantage ratio of officers to subject, as the rule, rather than
      the exception.
      1.5.6.2. The focus toward the confrontation should be primarily placed upon the
      "actions" of the subject, rather than the important, but secondary attributes of the "actor"
      in the situation. Certainly the "who" involved is of concern (e.g., past actions, previous
      history of violence, the subject's size/strength, etc.), but primary focus needs to be
      directed toward "what" is happening at the time - what the subject is doing. The
      ―reasonable officer‖ must guard against being lulled into complacency by past
      knowledge of the subject, or placing himself in crisis by pre-judging a mode of force
      utilization based upon previous contact, not present at this point in time.
      1.5.6.3. When placed into a confrontation, the ―reasonable officer‖ must expand his/her
      perspective from the common practice of ―reaction‖ into a more strategic
      confrontational conduct of an action initiated response.
            1.5.6.3.1. This response should be pro-active, drawn upon the officers expertise
            and experience, or other similar incidents. The officer should remain free of the
            pressure to pre-judge the actions of the subject, and gain the enhanced ability to
            more properly perceive the actual and/or potential actions of the subject in
            question.
            1.5.6.3.2. Ideally, the officer should practice anticipatory behavior (stress
            reduction techniques, conflict avoidance/resolution tactics, fear management
            skills, etc.) to attempt to prevent potential non-compliant confrontations. If a
            conflict is perceived as inevitable, he/she should initiate procedures to provide
            sufficient systems (strategic planning, team tactics, etc.) to maximize the status of
            safety for himself/herself, others, and the actual subject.
            1.5.6.3.3. The response must be active, in that the controlling tactics the officer
            initiates will accomplish the re-control of the subject with a high degree of
            effectiveness and safety to the officer and to others. In this manner, the
            confrontation can be controlled as efficiently as possible, thus avoiding the
AFMAN31-222          18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                  19

               selection of higher levels of force utilization with the inherent risks of greater
               potential injury to the officer, the subject, or others.
               1.5.6.3.4. Finally, the response must be based on the officer‘s experience and
               training, directing the officer's actions toward a mode of prevention via the
               tactical application of ―Lessons Learned,‖ or response based research. Most
               confrontations are not unique or remain isolated in time; their components will re-
               occur at other times with other subjects. If a safe, successful solution evolves, the
               officer should follow that course of response in the future. If the solution is not
               found, the officer should use the past experience as a catalyst to seek a safe,
               strategic, future solution.
               1.5.6.3.5. This principled status of safety can only be maintained if the officer
               strategically and systematically anticipates, assesses, and acts within the effective
               and accepted parameters of the situation. The officer must understand that this
               process and its products exist in an environment that is ever changing in
               definition, direction, and depth.
1.6. Unified Training Principles. Static training alone is not enough to adequately prepare Air
Force personnel for real life situations especially when involving force utilization. The Unified
Training Principles is a simple process consisting of four areas providing a frame of reference for
personnel to comprehend how to work through the elements of actual situations or
confrontations. Simplicity equals confidence and in turn leads to competence. These principles
cultivate empowerment by allowing the fluid integration of decision-making and tactical
concerns. Personnel are empowered to make any/all decisions about what techniques or tactics
are needed to resolve a situation. These principles build upon learned skills and techniques,
better prepare personnel to operate under realistic conditions, and develop personal confidence
and competence by providing practical training experiences. The survival mindset and mental
preparedness is initiated through the introduction to the Unified Training Principles. Following
are the four areas of the Unified Training Principles.
   1.6.1. Position of Advantage. Position of advantage is self-initiated and proactive rather than
   reactive. Any/all acceptable techniques or tactics designed to enhance officer safety and
   survival may be used to gain a position of advantage. Common examples include the
   planning, approach and reaction, e.g. field interview stance, defensive/offensive posture,
   distance, cover, proper placement of patrol vehicle, movement to or at an objective, the
   element of surprise, etc.
   1.6.2. Threat Assessment/Decision-Making. Threat assessment/decision-making is an on
   going process of determining potential threats and how to respond. Some examples of this
   principle are watching subject‘s hands, reading body language, recognizing and reacting to
   threat cues, identifying potential danger areas, etc.
   1.6.3. Response/Action. Response/action is the execution of the techniques or tactics
   selected in response to assessment of the situation. Examples of this principle include
   applying ―objectively reasonable‖ force, moving to or changing position of advantage,
   creating distance, calling for back up, falling back to a secondary position of cover, moving in
   to resolve the situation or disengaging to contain and stabilize, slow and deliberate search
   techniques, rapid raid techniques, etc.

1.6.4. Evaluation/Follow Through. Was the response effective? Is the situation under
control? Are there more suspects or weapons (continual threat assessment)? Does anything
else need to be done? If so, what are the priorities?
AFMAN31-222          18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                   21


                                            Chapter 2

                       CONTACT AND APPROACH TECHNIQUES

2.1. Introduction. As accomplished as we may be via education, training, and/or experience, we
can never totally predict the actions or responses within a confrontation. Therefore, in our effort
to maximize control, our approach toward the subject should be founded upon tactics consistent
with the controlled concept.
2.2. Challenging Individuals. The purpose of challenging an individual is to determine ―friend
from foe‖ and make a positive identification. NOTE: When feasible, one-person posts and
patrols should always request backup prior to initiating a challenge.
   2.2.1. Challenging Individuals on Foot. Once you determine you have reason to challenge a
   person you should first use your radio to notify the Security Forces Control Center (SFCC)
   using the SALUTE report format (Size, Activity, Location, Uniform/Unit, Time, and
   Equipment), and request backup if deemed necessary. Simultaneous to notifying the SFCC
   you should be using all available cover. Once under cover, perform the challenge in the
   following manner:
       2.2.1.1. Bring the M4 carbine to port arms or the M9 pistol to ready pistol (M9 in holster,
       flap released, and hand on grip of the M9).
       2.2.1.2. Command ―HALT‖ (blow whistle if appropriate). NOTE: If part of a team, only
       one person will issue commands.
       2.2.1.3. Command ―RAISE YOUR HANDS ABOVE YOUR HEAD, SPREAD YOUR
       FINGERS, AND SPREAD YOUR FEET.‖ This is the final challenge position.
       2.2.1.4. If the individual is inside a restricted area, remove him/her from the restricted
       area. If this isn‘t feasible, then face individual(s) away from protection level resources.
       2.2.1.5. Instruct the individual(s) to remove identification using the hand that is closest to
       where identification is located. NOTE: Use the restricted area badge (RAB) if in a
       restricted area.
       2.2.1.6. Have the individual(s) bend at the waist slowly and place identification on the
       ground.
       2.2.1.7. Have individual(s) turn around and walk approximately six paces away from you.
       Return individual(s) to final challenge position and scan surroundings for other suspects.
       2.2.1.8. Move forward cautiously and retrieve the credentials. After retrieving the
       credentials, return to a position of cover before you identify the individual(s). If more
       than one individual, identify each individual separately. NOTE: Insure you turn the
       individual toward you for picture identification.
       2.2.1.9. Once positive identification is verified, contact the SFCC for further direction as
       to disposition of the individual(s). If positive identification can‘t be verified, detain the
       individual(s), keep at a disadvantage, and wait for backup.
   2.2.2. Challenging Individuals in Vehicles. Notify the SFCC using the SALUTE report
   format and take available cover before performing the following:
  22                                                   AFMAN31-222          18 FEBRUARY 2009

       2.2.2.1. Bring the M4 carbine to port arms or the M9 pistol to ready pistol (M9 in holster,
       flap released, and hand on grip of the M9).
       2.2.2.2. Command ―HALT‖ (blow whistle if appropriate). NOTE: If part of a team, only
       one person will issue commands.
       2.2.2.3. Command ―TURN OFF THE ENGINE AND SET THE EMERGENCY
       BRAKE.‖
       2.2.2.4. HOURS OF DARKNESS: Command ―LEAVE THE HEADLIGHTS ON OR
       TURN THE DOMELIGHTS ON.‖ NOTE: Individuals challenged during the hours of
       darkness will be removed from the vehicle and placed so the headlights limit their view.
       Also, one person patrols will request back-up during the hours of darkness.
       2.2.2.5. Command ―FRONT SEAT OCCUPANTS PLACE YOUR HANDS ON THE
       DASH OR WINDSHIELD, REAR SEAT OCCUPANTS PLACE YOUR HANDS ON
       THE BACK OF THE FRONT SEAT OR ROOF.‖
       2.2.2.6. Have individual(s) dismount the vehicle one at a time from the side nearest the
       Security Forces member.
       2.2.2.7. Position individual(s) approximately six paces in front of the vehicle with arms
       up and fingers and feet spread. NOTE: During a daytime challenge, have the
       individual(s) face away from the vehicle. During the hours of darkness, have
       individual(s) face the vehicle headlights.
       2.2.2.8. Once the individual(s) are in the final challenge position, scan the area and
       approach the vehicle.
       2.2.2.9. Visually and briefly inspect the trunk or truck bed and the interior of the vehicle
       for persons. Do not initiate a search of the vehicle at this time.
       2.2.2.10. Take up a position of cover at the vehicle.
       2.2.2.11. Instruct individual(s) to remove identification using the hand that is closest to
       where identification media is located. NOTE: Use the RAB if in a restricted area.
       2.2.2.12. Have individual(s) place their identification on the hood of the vehicle one at a
       time.
       2.2.2.13. Return the individual(s) to a position approximately six paces in front of the
       vehicle with arms up and fingers and feet spread. NOTE: During a daytime challenge,
       have the individual(s) face away from the vehicle. During the hours of darkness, have
       individual(s) face the vehicle headlights after you have retrieved the identification from
       the hood.
       2.2.2.14. Make positive identification of the individuals.
       2.2.2.15. Once positive identification is made, terminate the challenge and contact the
       SFCC for further direction as to disposition of the individual(s). Also, if a violation has
       occurred, handcuffing and transportation will be necessary. If positive identification
       can‘t be verified, detain the individual(s), keep at a disadvantage, and wait for backup.
2.3. Alert Stance. Field analysis indicated the ―alert stance‖ best exhibits the essential traits of
caution and safety, and should be incorporated through patterns of practice until it becomes a
AFMAN31-222         18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                   23

conditioned response. The essence of the ―alert stance‖ is balance. Balance is best achieved by
assuming the stance with a solid base, in constant realization of the body‘s center of gravity.
  2.3.1. The ―alert stance‖ places the member at a safe distance to the front or side of the subject
  upon initial contact. From this position, the risk of being punched or kicked by the subject
  can be somewhat reduced and the subject‘s actions more easily detected. The contact itself
  may additionally appear less confrontational to the subject and act as a true tenet of the
  confrontation equation.
  2.3.2. The ―alert stance‖ places the member‘s weak foot forward, pointed toward the subject.
  The member‘s strong foot should be about a shoulder width behind the weak foot at an angle
  of 45 to 90 degrees. This foot positioning allows the officer the best options relative to
  balance, mobility, leverage, and strength utilization.
  2.3.3. The member‘s upper torso should mirror the status of safety, as well as the potential for
  the initiation of effective countermeasure controls. This capability is best realized by the
  member keeping his/her elbows close to the body and hands kept above the waist (Figure
  2.1.).
Figure 2.1. Alert Stance




  2.3.4. The member should avoid looking only at the subject‘s eyes during the confrontational
  contact, thus preventing the potential for distractions (fakes, hostile expressions, etc.) and
  should place primary sight concentration on the subject‘s upper chest area. While primary
  focus should be kept on the individual, the member must maintain situational awareness for
  possible additional threats.
  2.3.5. If the subject‘s actions were to change, the member could better perceive the risks
  presented and initiate proper countermeasures to gain control.

2.4. Communication/Control Member Positioning. Within each confrontation the principle of
tactical transition and the concept of the confrontational equation must be integrated into the
conditioning process. In the following verbal illustrations, two members approach an individual
by extending the traditional triangle of contact further to the front or side of the subject.
  2.4.1. Contact Officer. As a result of this extended position, the subject will most commonly
  begin to verbally or visually address one of the members. Dialog may also be initiated by one
  of the members during the approach as part of a tactical plan. In either case, the member who
  is first to communicate with the subject becomes the contact officer, continuing to maintain
  the subject‘s attention and providing for an avenue of potential verbal direction to the subject.
  2.4.2. Cover Officer. The supporting member now assumes an enhanced strategic position
  for potential countermeasure control techniques from the front/side or side/rear of the subject,
  thus becoming the cover officer. NOTE: If the subject were to change his communicative
  direction to the opposite officer, tactical transition would call for each of the members to
  switch communication and control roles to continue maximum tactical advantage for both
  members.

        PHYSICAL APPREHENSION AND RESTRAINT TECHNIQUES (PART)


3.1. Introduction. In the performance of your official duties, you may be required to make
physical contact with a noncompliant subject in order to maintain or regain control. The
essential elements in this process can be described in two words: ―when‖ and ―how.‖ Each of
the following PART will be presented in a functional format founded upon assessment and
application. The following techniques are only some of those that may be used and it‘s
important to remember that the minimum use of force necessary is always the correct use of
force. Generally, you can expect to use these techniques when the subject‘s actions are located
within the resistant (active) portion of the UFM.
3.2. Physical Apprehension and Restraint Techniques. These techniques depend on speed,
surprise, and skill. Begin PART from the alert stance discussed in Chapter 2.
  3.2.1. One Hand Grab Breakaway.
       3.2.1.1. STEP 1. Spread the fingers wide apart and rotate your thumb and hand 180
       degrees over the subject‘s hand. This will break the hold (Figures 3.1., 3.2., and 3.3.).
Figure 3.1. One Hand Grab Breakaway.

Figure 3.2. One Hand Grab Breakaway.




Figure 3.3. One Hand Grab Breakaway.




      3.2.1.2. STEP 2. Step to the rear with the same foot as the arm that was grabbed and pull
      up with your arm and reestablish a reactionary gap.
AFMAN31-222        18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                              27

  3.2.2. One Hand Arm Grab with Face Smash.
      3.2.2.1. STEP 1. Grab the attacker‘s wrist with the same hand that was grabbed by the
      attacker (Figure 3.4.).
Figure 3.4. One Hand Arm Grab with Face Smash.




      3.2.2.2. STEP 2. Step forward with the rear foot in the direction of the attacker. Then,
      using the weapon hand, strike the suspect in the face area with the heel of your hand
      (Figure 3.5.). NOTE: A follow-up technique would be to apply an arm bar after the
      face smash.
 28                                                  AFMAN31-222         18 FEBRUARY 2009


Figure 3.5. One Hand Arm Grab with Face Smash.




  3.2.3. Two Hand Grab with Face Smash.
      3.2.3.1. STEP 1. Grab the attacker‘s wrist with the same hand the attacker grabbed.
      3.2.3.2. STEP 2. Step forward with the rear foot in the direction of the attacker. Then,
      using the weapon hand, strike the suspect in the face area with the heel of your hand
      (Figure 3.6.). NOTE: An alternative technique would be to apply an arm bar after the
      face smash.
AFMAN31-222       18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                            29


Figure 3.6. Two Hand Grab with Face Smash.




  3.2.4. Chest Grab.
      3.2.4.1. STEP 1. When being pushed/grabbed, you must quickly ―trap‖ the suspect‘s
      hand. This ―trap‖ is accomplished by grabbing the suspect‘s arm below the elbow, your
      palms down, thumbs down, and trapping their hand on your chest (Figure 3.7.).
  30                                                AFMAN31-222         18 FEBRUARY 2009


Figure 3.7. Chest Grab.




       3.2.4.2. STEP 2. Press the suspect‘s hand firmly against your chest, take a step to the
       rear and bend forward slightly (Figure 3.8.).
AFMAN31-222        18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                               31


Figure 3.8. Chest Grab.




      3.2.4.3. STEP 3. Deliver a football style kick to the suspect‘s groin area (Figure 3.9.).
      NOTE: An alternative technique would be to apply an arm bar after the kick.
  32                                             AFMAN31-222        18 FEBRUARY 2009


Figure 3.9. Chest Grab.




  3.2.5. Hair Grab.
       3.2.5.1. STEP 1. The reaction is similar to the chest push. When grabbed, trap the
       suspect‘s hand on your head using both of your hands (Figure 3.10.).
AFMAN31-222        18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                33


Figure 3.10. Hair Grab.




      3.2.5.2. STEP 2. Take a step to the rear and tuck your chin into your neck (Figure 3.11.).


Figure 3.11. Hair Grab.
  34                                                 AFMAN31-222          18 FEBRUARY 2009

       3.2.5.3. STEP 3. Deliver a football style kick to the suspect‘s groin area with the strong
       foot (Figure 3.12.). NOTE: An alternative technique would be to apply an arm bar after
       the kick.
Figure 3.12. Hair Grab.




  3.2.6. Rear Grab. This hold is overcome with a blow to the groin.
       3.2.6.1. STEP 1. If a suspect wraps his/her arms around your body and over your arms,
       bring your hands to waist level and spread your arms out. Immediately assume a
       crouched position (Figure 3.13.).
AFMAN31-222       18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                              35


Figure 3.13. Rear Grab.




      3.2.6.2. STEP 2. Make a fist immediately, flex your arms out slightly, crouch down, and
      look at the suspect‘s feet (Figure 3.14.).
 36                                                AFMAN31-222         18 FEBRUARY 2009


Figure 3.14. Rear Grab.




      3.2.6.3. STEP 3. Step forward with the same foot the suspect has forward and pivot your
      hips away from the suspect‘s groin area (Figure 3.15.).
AFMAN31-222       18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                               37


Figure 3.15. Rear Grab.




      3.2.6.4. STEP 4. Once you have pivoted, strike the suspect‘s groin area sharply with the
      hand nearest that area (Figure 3.16.). NOTE: An alternative technique would be to
      apply an arm bar after the groin strike.
 38                                               AFMAN31-222        18 FEBRUARY 2009


Figure 3.16. Rear Grab.




3.3. IKKYO Techniques.
  3.3.1. IKKYO Grip.
      3.3.1.1. STEP 1. Grab the back of the suspect‘s right hand with your right hand, palm
      down, or his/her left hand with your left hand.
      3.3.1.2. STEP 2. Wrap your thumb around the suspect‘s thumb, then wrap the remaining
      four fingers around the suspect‘s hand (Figure 3.17.).
AFMAN31-222        18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                  39


Figure 3.17. IKKYO Grip.




  3.3.2. Two Directions of Pressure.
      3.3.2.1. STEP 1. After placing the suspect in the IKKYO grip, twist the suspect‘s
      right/left hand in a clockwise/counterclockwise direction until the elbow is facing straight
      up (Figure 3.18.). Simultaneously pivot on the ball of your weak foot and step back with
      your strong foot so your feet are aligned with the suspect‘s and spread your feet one
      shoulder width apart.
  40                                               AFMAN31-222         18 FEBRUARY 2009


Figure 3.18. Two Directions of Pressure.




       3.3.2.2. STEP 2. Place your weak hand directly on top of the suspect‘s right elbow and
       push the suspect‘s hand inward with your strong hand (Figure 3.19.).
Figure 3.19. Two Directions of Pressure.
AFMAN31-222        18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                 41

      3.3.2.3. STEP 3. Apply downward pressure on the elbow with your weak hand, rotating
      the elbow joint rearward while pushing inward on the suspect‘s hand. The suspect‘s arm
      should be at waist level and the fingers up (Figure 3.20.).
Figure 3.20. Two Directions of Pressure.




  3.3.3. Standing Arm Bar.
      3.3.3.1. STEP 1. After placing the suspect in two directions of pressure, fold his/her hand
      inward and place his/her wrist over and past the inside of your weak elbow. Remove
      your thumb from the fold of the suspect‘s arm and grab their triceps just above the elbow
      (Figure 3.21.).
 42                                                AFMAN31-222         18 FEBRUARY 2009


Figure 3.21. Standing Arm Bar.




      3.3.3.2. STEP 2. Move your inside foot to the rear of the suspect‘s feet and step to the
      left/right. At the same time, place your elbow into the small of the suspect‘s back. Do
      not release the grip on their triceps (Figure 3.22.).
AFMAN31-222        18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                               43


Figure 3.22. Standing Arm Bar.




      3.3.3.3. STEP 3. Simultaneously place the first two fingers of your strong hand under the
      suspect‘s nose and bring his/her head backwards, placing it on your right shoulder
      (Figure 3.23.). Your feet should be outside the suspect‘s feet, your knees slightly bent,
      and your back straight for balance. Your chest should be touching the suspect‘s
      shoulders, but your pelvic area should not be in contact with their buttocks. NOTE: If
      additional control is needed, raise the suspect on his/her toes by applying upward
      pressure on the suspect‘s restrained arm while pushing inward and up with the two
      fingers under their nose.
 44                                                AFMAN31-222         18 FEBRUARY 2009


Figure 3.23. Standing Arm Bar.




  3.3.4. IKKYO Takedown.
      3.3.4.1. STEP 1. Perform the Two Directions of Pressure (Figure 3.24.).
AFMAN31-222       18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                               45


Figure 3.24. IKKYO Takedown.




      3.3.4.2. STEP 2. Apply straight downward pressure on the elbow while pushing up on
      the hand. Simultaneously take a small step forward with your weak foot and a large step
      forward with your outside foot while maintaining control of the suspect‘s arm (Figure
      3.25.). Keep the arm parallel to the ground while you drop to your weak knee. Continue
      to drop the arm parallel until it is on the ground (Figure 3.26.). NOTE: Failure to keep
      the suspect‘s arm parallel to the ground may result in an injury.

      3.3.4.3. STEP 3. Place your inside knee beside the suspect‘s waist area and place your
      outside leg in a balanced kneeling position with your foot flat on the ground (Figure
      3.27.). NOTE: This places the suspect in a prone arm bar position.
Figure 3.27. IKKYO Takedown/Prone Arm Bar.




  3.3.5. Prone Arm Bar.
      3.3.5.1. STEP 1. While the suspect is in the prone position, lift the suspect‘s arm upward
      bending the suspect‘s arm at the elbow and rotating it clockwise (Figure 3.28.).
Figure 3.28. Prone Arm Bar.




      3.3.5.2. STEP 2. Remove your thumb from the fold of the suspect‘s arm and grab his/her
      triceps just above the elbow. Place the suspect‘s wrist over the top and outside of your
 48                                             AFMAN31-222         18 FEBRUARY 2009

      weak elbow. Place your elbow with the suspect‘s wrist/arm in the small of the back
      (Figure 3.29.).
Figure 3.29. Prone Arm Bar.




      3.3.5.3. STEP 3. Pivot on the downed knee and place the other knee on the suspect‘s
      upper back, below (not on) the neck (Figure 3.30.).
Figure 3.30. Prone Arm Bar.
AFMAN31-222        18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                              49

      3.3.5.4. STEP 4. Use pain compliance and tell the suspect to place his/her hand on the
      small of their back. NOTE: Handcuffing may be accomplished by cuffing the restrained
      hand first.

4.1. Weapons Retention Techniques. These techniques are designed to stop a suspect who is
attempting to take your weapon away from you. These techniques should be executed quickly
and with sufficient force to ensure the suspect will fail.
  4.1.1. Lower Forearm Block. This technique is used to prevent an attempt to remove the
  weapon from your holster (suspect approaching from the rear) (Figure 4.1.).
Figure 4.1. Lower Forearm Block.




      4.1.1.1. STEP 1. As the suspect approaches from the rear and attempts to reach for your
      weapon with either or both hands, make a tight fist with your weapon hand and swing it
      down and to the rear at a 45-degree angle striking the suspect‘s extended arm(s) with
      your forearm.
 62                                                AFMAN31-222         18 FEBRUARY 2009


Figure 4.2. Lower Forearm Block.




      4.1.1.2. STEP 2. Simultaneously pivot on the ball of your weak foot and swing your
      strong leg to your rear 180-degrees following the direction of the swinging arm. You are
      now facing the suspect (Figure 4.3.).
AFMAN31-222       18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                              63


Figure 4.3. Lower Forearm Block.




      4.1.1.3. STEP 3. Using an authoritative tone of voice, talk the suspect into the ground
      handcuffing position while continuing to observe the suspect until such time as your
      backup can secure the suspect with handcuffs.
  4.1.2. Rear Wrist Lock #1 (Strong Hand Grab). This technique is designed to prevent a
  suspect from removing your weapon from the rear. The assumption is that the suspect will
  grab your weapon with the same hand as your shooting hand (Figure 4.4.).
 64                                             AFMAN31-222        18 FEBRUARY 2009


Figure 4.4. Rear Wrist Lock #1 (Strong Hand Grab).




      4.1.2.1. STEP 1. As the suspect grabs the butt of the weapon, place your hand palm
      down on top of the grabbing hand as though you were going to draw the weapon. Push
      down hard to prevent the suspect from lifting the weapon (Figure 4.5.).
AFMAN31-222       18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                            65


Figure 4.5. Rear Wrist Lock #1 (Strong Hand Grab).




      4.1.2.2. STEP 2. At the same time, place your weak hand (palm down) over the holster
      flap. At this point you should be pressing down with both hands to prevent removal of
      the weapon from the holster (Figure 4.6.).
Figure 4.6. Rear Wrist Lock #1 (Strong Hand Grab).
 66                                                 AFMAN31-222         18 FEBRUARY 2009

      4.1.2.3. STEP 3. Continue pushing down with the weak hand as you curl the fingers of
      your weapon hand into the palm of the suspect‘s gripping hand, weapon thumb pressing
      into the webbing between the thumb and index finger of the suspect‘s hand.
      4.1.2.4. STEP 4. Continue pushing down with the weak hand as you twist the suspect‘s
      palm outward (as in IKKYO) to your side, causing their wrist to turn, releasing his/her
      grip from the butt of the weapon (Figure 4.7.).
Figure 4.7. Rear Wrist Lock #1 (Strong Hand Grab).




      4.1.2.5. STEP 5. As the wrist is turned, take a short sliding step forward with your weak
      foot then pivot on the ball of your weak foot and swing your strong leg to your rear 180-
      degrees as you face the suspect and withdraw your weapon side away from the suspect.
      4.1.2.6. STEP 6. At this point the weak hand can be released from the weapon and
      placed alongside the weapon hand to increase the pressure on the suspect‘s wrist by
      pushing hard against the back with your thumbs. The fingers of the weak hand will grab
      the palm of the suspect, and the thumb of the weak hand will be on the back of the
      suspect‘s hand alongside your strong thumb. NOTE: At this point the fingers on the
      suspect‘s locked hand will point straight up.
      4.1.2.7. STEP 7. As you grip the suspect‘s hand with both your hands, apply extreme
      pressure against his/her wrist with both of your thumbs. Increase pressure on the wrist
      until the suspect‘s shoulder is below your hand level.
      4.1.2.8. STEP 8. At this point push off from the suspect (Figure 4.8.) NOTE: Repeat
      step 3 when employing the lower forearm block.
AFMAN31-222       18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                        67


Figure 4.8. Rear Wrist Lock #1 (Strong Hand Grab).




  4.1.3. Rear Wrist Lock #2 (Weak Hand Grab). This technique is to be used if a suspect
  grabs the butt of your weapon from the rear with the hand opposite your shooting hand
  (Figure 4.9.).
 68                                                AFMAN31-222         18 FEBRUARY 2009


Figure 4.9. Rear Wrist Lock #2 (Weak Hand Grab).




      4.1.3.1. STEP 1. Repeat steps 1 through 3 for the rear wrist lock #1 (strong hand grab)
      (Figure 4.10.).
AFMAN31-222       18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                              69


Figure 4.10. Rear Wrist Lock #2 (Weak Hand Grab).




      4.1.3.2. STEP 4. Grasping the thumb and twisting the suspect‘s hand palm up and
      rearward at a 45-degree angle from his/her shoulder (Figure 4.11.). Bring the weak hand
      up to mirror the strong hand pushing down hard on the suspect‘s hand. At the same time
      step back with your strong foot, pivot on your weak foot, and force the suspect to the
      ground (Figure 4.12.).

                 USE OF OLEORESIN CAPSICUM (OC) PEPPER SPRAY


5.1. Introduction. Thorough training in the use of OC spray is critical. Training enhances the
spray‘s effectiveness, protects both the user and the Air Force against liability, and ensures the
safety of the user and the subject. Comprehensive training should go beyond the technical
application to include physiological reactions, legal issues (use of force guidelines), tactical
issues, and applications. MAJCOMs develop procedures for reporting use and accounting
for/inventory of OC spray. Units document all pepper spray training. Generally, you can expect
to use OC spray when the subject‘s actions are located within the resistant (active) portion of the
UFM. MAJCOMs in overseas areas must coordinate with the local SJA to ensure its use does
not violate any status of forces agreements. NOTE: Any OC spray field units purchase/use
must be an Air Force approved product.
5.2. Characteristics. Oleoresin capsicum (OC), commonly called pepper spray, is a highly
concentrated form of peppers or similar synthetic and a naturally occurring inflammatory agent
affecting the mucous membranes of humans and animals. It comes from the oily resin of
cayenne and other varieties of peppers used in spicy foods. When applied to the face, OC causes
swelling of the mucous membranes, involuntary closing of the eyes, gagging, coughing,
shortness of breath, and an intense burning sensation on exposed skin. Typically, persons
sprayed with OC involuntarily drop to their knees. OC is consistently effective against persons
with reduced sensitivity to pain, such as those under the influence of PCP or other drugs.
Symptoms are temporary, but may last up to 45-minutes when left untreated. OC spray is
available in two forms, water based or alcohol based. Although the alcohol-based product is
hazardous when used near flame or spark producing devices, it is the standard for Air Force use
as it is normally useable in the temperature ranges we normally encounter.
5.3. Storing OC Spray.
   5.3.1. Do not store OC Spray near a heat source or open flame.
   5.3.2. Do not store OC Spray at temperatures above 120-degrees Fahrenheit as this may cause
   the canister to leak or burst.
   5.3.3. Do not expose OC Spray units to temperatures below 32-degrees Fahrenheit for long
   periods (see manufacturers manual for details) as this may cause slower discharge from the
   canister and weaken the effectiveness of the spray.
5.4. Training. Initial and annual (not to exceed 12 months) refresher training on OC Spray is
mandatory for those armed with it. All Security Forces members will be trained on pepper spray
prior to carrying it while on duty. Use this manual for training source material.
   5.4.1. Initial Training. Initial training must address all topics in this chapter. Cap Stun
   Model T-305 is the mandatory unit for training. It has the same delivery and performance
   features as all Air Force approved OC products with the exception of the active ingredient.
   NOTE: Security Forces members will be sprayed with an active agent, see Attachment 2
   A2.16, as part of initial certification training. This serves a twofold purpose. First it provides
   an understanding of what it is like to get sprayed with OC. Second it makes Security Forces
AFMAN31-222         18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                  73

  members aware of what they have to contend with should they be sprayed by an attacker or
  get the OC on themselves when spraying a suspect.
  5.4.2. Annual Training. Recertify the training annually (not to exceed 12 months) during the
  standardization evaluation process or IAW locally developed training plans. NOTE:
  Spraying Security Forces members with an active agent is only required once during their
  career. It is not required during annual (not to exceed 12 months) certification if the Security
  Forces member was previously sprayed. It is required during annual (not to exceed 12
  months) training if the Security Forces member was never sprayed during any previous
  training.
  5.4.3. Documenting Training. Units must document all OC Spray training (initial and
  annual refresher training) on the AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring
  Training.
  5.4.4. Instructors. Initial certification and certification upon each subsequent permanent
  change of station must be by a graduate of the Principles of Instruction or Basic Instructor
  Course (BIC). Alternatively, individuals graduating the Inter-service Non-lethal Individual
  Weapons Instructor Course (INIWIC), FLETC, or other master instructor certification course,
  may instruct the class. All other annual (not to exceed 12 months) certification may be by a
  supervisor, trainer, combat arms individual, or quality control evaluator who is currently
  certified. These personnel must use this manual and the lesson plan posted on the Air Force
  Security Forces Center website at http://afsf.lackland.af.mil/. NOTE: MAJCOMs and local
  commanders may set more stringent certification criteria.
5.5. OC Spray Utilization. The holstered/hooded unit should be positioned tactically on the
Security Forces member‘s belt IAW local policy or per individual preference if no local policy
exists. When you place the holster on your belt, ensure it is not close to other equipment that
could press against the trigger when you sit down or perform normal duties. NOTE: MAJCOM‘s
and local commanders may establish local procedures and policies for carrying OC Spray, Taser,
and the baton.
  5.5.1. Pre-utilization Actions. You should gain a tactical position relative to the subject once
  a suspect is perceived as a resistant (active) subject (third level on the UFM.
  5.5.1.1. You should indicate to other Security Forces present by sign or code word that OC is
  about to be dispersed.
  5.5.1.2. Consider the environment. Many OC sprays use isopropyl alcohol as the propellant
  and should not be used near an open flame or spark source. Isopropyl alcohol within
  controlled environments does not cause flammability problems. However, just as in any other
  commercially available household aerosol, the spray should not be used at close range directly
  toward sparks or flames.
  5.5.2. Utilization Actions. Remove the canister from the holster and hold firmly in the
  upright position.
       5.5.2.1. From a range of 6 to 8-feet, ideally, the Security Forces member should hold the
       unit close to his/her upper chest and target the suspect‘s eyes. At this distance, the spray
       pattern will be approximately 32-inches.
  74                                                   AFMAN31-222          18 FEBRUARY 2009

       5.5.2.2. Direct one-second bursts at the suspect‘s facial area (e.g., eyes, nose, and mouth).
       The OC Spray pattern delivers a full cone mist pattern rather than a solid stream. Due to
       the relatively short range of pepper spray and close proximity to the suspect, exercise
       extreme caution.
       5.5.2.3. If used in a crowded area, be conscious of the effects of overspray on bystanders.
       Ideally, position yourself upwind of the suspect. Avoid traveling through areas recently
       contaminated with pepper spray.
       5.5.2.4. Be aware that continuous spraying will dilute the formulation and decrease
       effectiveness.
       5.5.2.5. If the spray is effective, you should notice disorientation, closing of the eyes,
       difficulty breathing, loss of motor control, and complaints of intense burning within about
       2 to 3 seconds.
       5.5.2.6. During this period, you should continue to communicate with the suspect and
       employ additional controlling directives.
       5.5.2.7. Once the subject is debilitated, move in and establish a hand rotation position on
       the suspect. NOTE: Be aware of residual OC remaining on the subject and how it may
       affect your ability to handle the subject.
       5.5.2.8. If noncompliance persists, continue the hand rotation technique until full
       compliance is realized and the handcuff/searching process can be initiated.
5.6. Lethality Issues. Although suspects have died after being sprayed with pepper spray, OC
Spray was not implicated as a lethal factor. These deaths share several common elements. All
suspects were combative and resisted apprehension. Drugs and/or alcohol were a factor in most
cases. Restraint techniques were employed after using pepper spray. Also, research shows four
conditions that account for the majority of custody related deaths: positional asphyxia, cocaine
intoxication, excited delirium, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. These factors must be
considered when placing a suspect in custody.
  5.6.1. Positional Asphyxia. Positional asphyxia occurs when respiration is interrupted due to
  the position of the body. Accordingly, suspects should remain in an upright, seated position.
  Prone restraint techniques can have sudden lethal consequences. Avoid placing a restrained
  suspect face down.
  5.6.2. Cocaine Intoxication. Cocaine stimulates both the central nervous and cardiovascular
  systems. It constricts the blood vessels, elevates heart rate, raises blood pressure, and
  increases body temperature. These factors can cause hemorrhage, stroke and kidney and
  intestinal failure.
  5.6.3. Excited Delirium. Excited delirium induced by cocaine manifests itself as impaired
  thinking, disorientation, hallucinations, and illusions. Suspects suffering from this condition
  are often violent and unpredictable.
       5.6.3.1. Excited delirium is usually regarded as a potentially lethal medical emergency.
       Symptoms include intense paranoia, followed immediately by violent and bizarre
       behavior. Sufferers often display violence against glass objects, strip off their clothing,
       run, and scream uncontrollably.
AFMAN31-222        18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                 75

      5.6.3.2. Treat these suspects with extreme caution. They can become very violent.
      Restrain suspects exhibiting these symptoms and promptly transport them to a medical
      facility.
  5.6.4. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome.                Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is
  characteristically similar to excited delirium and generally occurs in psychiatric patients who
  are taking medication. Physical exhaustion, dehydration, and organic brain disease are
  additional symptoms. Stress associated with apprehension can exacerbate this condition.
  5.6.5. Considerations. Awareness and recognition of risk indicators is necessary to ensure
  the safety of suspects in custody. Provide continuous monitoring and observation of suspects
  displaying any of the indicators discussed above. Avoid the use of prone restraint techniques
  on suspects displaying these danger signs.
5.7. Post-Use Care. Once the subject has been sprayed and secured, act to calm the suspect
through verbal commands/directions: ―You have been sprayed with OC Spray, follow my
instructions.‖
  5.7.1. Immediate Actions.       Remove the suspect to an uncontaminated area as soon as
  practical.
      5.7.1.1. Any suspect sprayed with OC must be transported to a medical treatment facility,
      as soon as practical, for attention by a health care professional. Medical personnel should
      be contacted to conduct transport. However, if it is impractical/impossible for medical
      personnel to transport the suspect, two Security Forces personnel may conduct the
      transport.
      5.7.1.2. Once cleared by a health care professional, transport the subject to a holding
      facility. One of the transporting Security Forces members should continue to directly
      monitor the sprayed suspect during the entire course of transport.
      5.7.1.3. Upon arrival at the Security Forces facility, the receiving Security Forces should
      be advised the suspect has been sprayed with OC Spray.
      5.7.1.4. The suspect should be continually monitored for a minimum of one hour from the
      time of the initial exposure to OC Spray. During this period, the subject should be
      encouraged to talk and express the nature of the effects of the OC Spray to better monitor
      the suspect.
  5.7.2. Emergency Actions. Emergency personnel should be called if during the monitoring
  period the suspect displays any of the following.
      5.7.2.1. Complaint of a previous respiratory condition.
      5.7.2.2. Loss of consciousness.
      5.7.2.3. Stops breathing.
      5.7.2.4. Suddenly becomes incoherent.
      5.7.2.5. Begins to hyperventilate.
      5.7.2.6. Shows any signs of sickness.
      5.7.2.7. Continues to have adverse effects from the OC Spray after three hours.
  76                                                    AFMAN31-222           18 FEBRUARY 2009

  5.7.3. Contaminated Areas. Move other personnel exposed to the agent to fresh air as soon
  as possible and flush contaminated areas with large amounts of water. Remove contact lenses
  and contaminated clothing, and wash thoroughly before reuse. Do not apply salves, creams,
  oils or lotions to the skin as they trap the irritant. Seek medical attention if irritation persists.
5.8. Use of OC Spray Against an Officer. If you as a Security Forces member are confronted
by a suspect utilizing OC Spray as a weapon, realize this suspect can be perceived as an
assaultive suspect depending on your assessment of risk potential. Initially, increase your
distance from the suspect.
  5.8.1. Use the non-weapon hand to attempt to shield your face, tip your head forward, or
  cover your face with your shirt.
  5.8.2. Maintain a secure grasp on your holstered weapon as you attempt to prevent debilitating
  exposure via assaultive countermeasures (kicks, strikes, etc.).
  5.8.3. Constantly assess the nature of the attack in order to maintain the proper balance of
  threat and appropriate design of countermeasures taken.
5.9. Warnings.
  5.9.1. Avoid dispensing OC Spray inside a vehicle. The restricted space will drastically
  increase the effects of the OC Spray. NOTE: This does not absolutely preclude the use of
  OC Spray on actively resistant suspects in a vehicle if use is warranted.
  5.9.2. Periodically check to ensure the holster hood is locked in place.
  5.9.3. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Air Force safety instructions prohibit OC
  Spray from being carried in the passenger compartment, either on one‘s person or in carry-on
  baggage, aboard aircraft engaged in flight operations.
       5.9.3.1. Passengers will not carry OC on military aircraft.
       5.9.3.2. Transport is allowed on commercial aircraft. According to 49 CFR 175.10 (a)
       (4) (ii), one self-defense spray, not to exceed 118 milliliters (4 fluid ounces) by volume,
       that incorporates a positive means to prevent accidental discharge, may be carried in
       checked baggage only.
       5.9.3.3. A Security Forces member may pack one OC Spray canister not exceeding 118
       milliliters (4 fluid ounces) in personal checked baggage on commercial aircraft. The
       Security Forces member must declare the OC Spray canister to the airlines when
       checking baggage.
  5.9.4. Weather conditions such as rain and high winds may reduce the effectiveness of OC
  Spray.
  5.9.5. Although OC Spray has been proven effective against animals, studies indicate it is less
  effective against attack-trained dogs. Dogs sprayed with OC Spray may become more
  aggressive upon recovery.
  5.9.6. Use of OC Spray in certain overseas areas may violate status of forces agreements.
  NOTE: In overseas areas, confer with local judge advocates prior to ordering OC Spray.
  5.9.7. Avoid accidental contact with eyes, skin or mucous membranes.
  5.9.8. Do not puncture or incinerate the can.
AFMAN31-222        18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                               77

  5.9.9. Do not spray against the wind.
  5.9.10. Keep out of reach of children. OC Spray is not to be handled by minors.
  5.9.11. Do not use OC Spray against a suspect aiming a deadly force weapon toward you. In
  this situation another alternative or a higher level of force may be justified.
  5.9.12. Do not handcuff the suspect behind the back or place pressure on the suspects back in
  any position that may cause difficulty breathing.
5.10. Reporting and Recording OC Spray Utilization. Units must develop local procedures
for recording OC Spray utilization via AF Form 4292, Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) Use Report.
MAJCOMs determine the need for any periodic reporting of OC Spray utilization. NOTE: If an
event is significant creating negative media publicity, a Lessons Learned Report will be
submitted to AFSFC/SFOP IAW AFI 31-201, Security Police Standards and Procedures.

                                            Chapter 6
                                      IMPACT WEAPONS


6.1. Overview. Impact weapons have a long history of effectiveness and application in law
enforcement. Over the years unique design changes have occurred, but the basic principle of
impact, either by compression or concussion, has remained the same. Collapsible batons are
compact instruments that bridge the gap between fists and firearms. Their design solves a major
problem with full size batons because it‘s compact enough to wear on standard issue duty belts.
There is no problem with a collapsible baton hitting against the legs during a foot chase as with a
full size baton. Due to its compact size, it is less likely a suspect will be able to take the impact
device from the officer. Generally, you can expect to use the baton against a suspect whose
actions place him/her within the assaultive (physical injury) portion of the UFM.
6.2. Nomenclature. The basic collapsible baton is available in black anodized or satin chrome
finish. Only AF issued or authorized batons may be carried. Models are available from a
number of manufacturers measuring from 6 to 11-inches collapsed and 16 to 31-inches deployed.
All are equipped with some type of lock to prevent collapse when thrust into a suspect‘s body.
However, there have been instances where the locks have failed. Officers shall not alter or
modify an approved baton. NOTE: Replacement of the end cap does not constitute a
modification.
6.3. Target Areas. Due to physiological vulnerability, principle target areas for baton use are
the areas surrounding the arms and legs, both thighs and calves. Push strikes to lower abdominal
areas can also be used and are extremely effective. These strikes generate fluid shock waves,
usually causing a suspect to double over, allowing officers to strike the arms, thighs, and calves
disabling suspects. NOTE: Intentional strikes to the face, head, neck, kidneys, solar plexus, and
groin can cause death and are not authorized unless deadly force is the only remaining option.
6.4. Carrying and Using the Baton.
   6.4.1. Carrying the Baton. The baton is carried on an equipment belt in leather or nylon
   cases, or other such carrier approved by the manufacturer. The baton is positioned in front of
   your service weapon or in a position that is comfortable for the user (Figures 6.1. and 6.2.).

  6.4.2. Drawing the Baton. Initiate a baton draw by grasping the baton handle with your
  strong hand and pulling it from the holster (Figure 6.3.). Initiate a wrist snap technique to
  fully expand the baton into the open, locked position.
AFMAN31-222         18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                 81


Figure 6.3. Drawing the Baton.




  6.4.3. Baton Techniques. Proper body mechanics form the foundation for all baton
  techniques. The importance of a good stance cannot be overemphasized. This stance is
  achieved by paying attention to four basic components. The first component is to achieve a
  wide base. This is obtained by standing with feet shoulder width apart. The next component
  is a deep base that is achieved by taking a step backward with your weapon leg. The
  combination of these two components balances your body from all sides. To further improve
  one‘s balance it is necessary to bend your knees slightly, thus lowering your center of gravity.
  The last component is to keep your head over your center of gravity.
      6.4.3.1. Once the baton is drawn from the holster, move the baton to the center of your
      body. In this position, your strong hand is on the handle of the baton, while your weak
      hand is placed on the shaft of the baton with your palm directed away from you. This is
      known as the ―on-guard‖ position (Figure 6.4.).
 82                                                 AFMAN31-222          18 FEBRUARY 2009


Figure 6.4. On-Guard Position.




      6.4.3.2. Bring the drawn baton to a position over your strong side shoulder while grasping
      the handle of the baton with your strong hand. Simultaneous to this movement, keep
      your weak hand raised to provide defensive protection. This is known as the ―high
      position‖ (Figure 6.5.).
AFMAN31-222         18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                  83


Figure 6.5. High Position.




       6.4.3.3. Bring the drawn baton to a position to the side or rear of the strong leg with your
       strong hand on the handle of the baton. You can reposition the baton based upon your
       perception of threat levels, degree of deterrence sought, etc. (Figure 6.6.).
  84                                                  AFMAN31-222          18 FEBRUARY 2009


Figure 6.6. Strong Side Baton Positioning.




6.5. Baton Strikes. The baton is used primarily as an impact weapon to strike against motor
nerve areas of the body. Strikes to the motor nerve areas do not rely on pain to stop the suspect‘s
actions (although a hard strike will cause pain). Instead, the blow disrupts the muscular integrity
of the suspect. The results of motor nerve strikes are involuntary contractions of the affected
muscles and subsequent disorientation and loss of balance on the part of the suspect.
   6.5.1. Strike Ready Position. Initiate the high position with the expanded baton with your
   weak hand toward the target area (Figure 6.7.).
AFMAN31-222        18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                             85


Figure 6.7. Strike Ready Position.




  6.5.2. Downward Strike. Initiate a downward motion with the expanded baton, with your
  palm directed away from the target area. In some circumstances, an additional strike may be
  necessary to separate you from the suspect/subject (Figures 6.8., 6.9., and 6.10.).
 86                                           AFMAN31-222      18 FEBRUARY 2009

6.6. Post-Use Care. Once a suspect has been hit with a baton, Security Forces members should
act to calm the individual through directions.
  6.6.1. Immediate Actions. Any suspect hit with a baton must be transported to a medical
  treatment facility, as soon as practical, for attention by a health care professional. Medical
  personnel should be contacted to conduct transport. However, if it is impractical/impossible
  for medical personnel to transport the suspect, two Security Forces personnel may conduct the
  transport.
       6.6.1.1. Once the suspect is initially cleared by a health care professional, the suspect
       should be transported to a detention facility.
AFMAN31-222         18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                  89

       6.6.1.2. Once the transport has been completed, receiving Security Forces members at the
       detention facility should be advised that the suspect has been hit with a baton and identify
       where the suspect was hit.
       6.6.1.3. Photographs shall be taken of the impact sites and any other related injuries and
       placed into the case file.
       6.6.1.4. The suspect should be continually monitored for a minimum of one-hour from
       the time of the initial baton strike.
  6.6.2. Emergency Actions. Emergency personnel should be called during the monitoring
  period if the suspect complains of any discomfort from the baton strike.
6.7. Training. Initial and annual refresher training (not to exceed 12 months) with the baton is
mandatory for those armed with it.
  6.7.1. Initial Training. Initial training must address all topics in this chapter. NOTE: The
  use of local or state civilian training is authorized provided it meets or exceeds the training
  requirements of this manual.
  6.7.2. Annual Training. Recertify the training annually (not to exceed 12 months) during
  the standardization evaluation process or IAW locally developed training plans. Retrain
  individuals that do not undergo standardization evaluation on an annual basis.
  6.7.3. Documenting Training. Units must document all baton training (initial and annual
  refresher training) on the AF Form 1098.
  6.7.4. Instructors. Initial certification and certification upon each subsequent permanent
  change of station must be by a graduate of the principles of Instruction or Basic Instructor
  Course (BIC). Alternatively, individuals graduating the Inter-service Non-lethal Individual
  Weapons Instructor Course (INIWIC), FLETC, or other master instructor certification course,
  may instruct the class. All other annual (not to exceed 12 months) certification may be by a
  supervisor, trainer, combat arms individual, or quality control evaluator who is currently
  certified. These personnel must use this manual and the lesson plan posted on the Air Force
  Security Forces Center website at http://afsf.lackland.af.mil/.

                                           Chapter 7
                                      M26/X26 TASER®


7.1. Introduction. The M26 ADVANCED TASER® and the X26 TASER® is a conducted
energy weapon manufactured by Taser International Inc. It uses direct contact or propelled wires
to conduct energy that affects the sensory and motor functions of the central nervous system.
The primary intended effect is electro-muscular disruption to assure compliance. Generally, you
can expect to use an approved electronic control device when the subject‘s actions are located
within the resistant (active) portion of the Use of Force Model (refer to AFI 31-207, para 1.3.).
Additionally, CONUS MAJCOMs will ensure installations coordinate with the Judge Advocate‘s
(SJA) office to confirm that an approved electronic control device use is permitted at local
installations. OCONUS MAJCOMs and deployed units in overseas areas will coordinate with
the local SJA to ensure use of approved electronic control devices does not violate any Status of
Forces Agreements or international laws. Further explanation and training can be retrieved from
the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) on the HQ Air Force Security Forces Center web
site at https://afsfmil.lackland.af.mil/.
7.2. Nomenclature. The M26/X26 is similar in shape and appearance to a pistol (Figure 7.1.).
The safety on/off switch is modeled after the safety of a pistol and its mechanical functions are
similar to the de-cock lever on an M9 pistol (Figure 7.2.). When the safety is flipped upward
with either thumb, the weapon system is turned on and a laser designator projects from
underneath the front of the weapon serving as both an aim point and a deterrent to the subject.
Authorized SF personnel will only carry an AF issued M26 Advanced TASER®/X26 TASER®,
M26/X26 TASER® cartridges and equipment. SF personnel shall not, in any way, alter or
modify these weapons.
Figure 7.1. M26 Advanced TASER®.
AFMAN31-222         18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                 91


Figure 7.2. Ambidextrous Safety.




  7.2.1. Cartridges. The M26/X26 uses various cartridges (Figure 7.3.). There are two field
  cartridges with different maximum ranges, one fires out to 15-feet and the others have a
  maximum range of 21-25 feet. Security Forces will use only the cartridge with the furthest
  range (25 foot range). The air cartridge containing darts and wires is attached to the front of
  the weapon and open sights exist on the top of the weapon. In the upper rear of the weapon is
  a battery indicator and a data-port through which data can be obtained regarding when the
  weapon was fired, the duration of electrical shock, etc.
Figure 7.3. Cartridge Types.




  7.2.2. Batteries. Use only high output alkaline or rechargeable Nickel Metal Hydride
  batteries in the approved electronic control device as use of any other type of batteries result
  92                                                  AFMAN31-222          18 FEBRUARY 2009

   in degraded performance. Batteries and cartridges will be disposed of in accordance with
   packaging instructions and Air Force Instructions.
7.3. Training. Thorough training in the use of the electronic control devices is critical to proper
use and employment. Training enhances the Taser‘s effectiveness, protects both the user and the
Air Force against liability, and ensures the safety of the user, the subject, and bystanders.
Comprehensive training should go beyond the technical application to include physiological
reactions, legal issues (use of force guidelines), tactical issues, and applications.
   7.3.1. Conducting Training. Instructors must complete a TASER® master instructor course
   through TASER® International Inc, the Inter-service Non-Lethal Weapons Instructors Course
   (INLWIC), Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), or other master instructor
   certification course and must recertify every two years. Installations may contact TASER®
   International Inc or FLETC to arrange instructor training. If trained by a civilian Master
   Instructor, ensure AF policy and TTPs are reviewed and incorporated into your training plan
   for your user‘s certification training. Once trained, instructors will train all Security Forces
   members who will carry the TASER®. The training will be conducted annually (not to
   exceed 12 months). To ensure users are familiarized with electronic control devices
   employment, each trainee will deploy a minimum of three cartridges (training or live) and
   must successfully complete and pass the written certification test and evaluation specified by
   TASER® International Inc. Additionally, AFSFC/SFX has developed a TTP lesson plan for
   conducting annual training. The lesson plan is posted on the AFSFC web site. Installations
   wishing to use TASER® International must contact the training coordinator directly at 800-
   978-2737 or http://www.taser.com to arrange instructor training.
   NOTE: Although, TASER® International Inc recommends training include every user
   receiving a 5-second duty cycle, AF members being trained will NOT be tased as part of the
   training curriculum.
   7.3.2. Annual User Training. Trained AF instructors will train all Security Forces TASER®
   users annually. As a minimum, trainees must successfully complete and pass the written
   certification test and evaluation specified by TASER® International Inc. Evaluations can
   include cartridge employment at the unit commander‘s discretion. The TTPs include lesson
   plans for conducting annual training.
   7.3.3. Documenting Training. Units must document all electronic control devices training
   (initial and annual refresher training) on the AF Form 1098.
7.4. Voluntary Exposure During Training. TASER® International Inc recommends every
user receiving a five second duty cycle exposure as part of training. SF will not require members
to receive the five second exposure to be certified; however this does not preclude members from
volunteering. In order to better understand the effects of the incapacitation of electronic control
devices, SF users and instructors are highly encouraged to receive the exposure at least one in
their career. All volunteers, military or civilian, must fill out the Warning, Risk, and Informed
Consent prior to being exposed. The form must also be annotated by the certified instructor who
will be conducting the exposure. The Informed Consent form is attached to the TTPs as stated in
Para 3.4.
7.5. Carrying TASER®. Electronic control devices must be carried in holsters provided as part
of the non-lethal capability kit or carrying case provided with the weapon when purchased from
AFMAN31-222         18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                    93

the manufacturer. The TASER® will be worn in a support side carry position and WILL NOT
be worn on the same side of the body as the firearm. Purchase of the optional spare cartridge
holder for the pistol grip is recommended to improve weapons handling. NOTE: Always
replace the air cartridge prior to expiration. The 5-year expiration date is printed on each
cartridge. EXCEPTON: When conducting prisoner escort on an aircraft no cartridge will be
inserted, and only the drive-stun mode will be used (see paragraph 7.10.2.).
  7.5.1. Holster/Belt Clip. X26 TASER® comes with the Exoskeleton Holster, but the 3‘ Belt
  Clip to fit out nylon belts must be requested separately.
  7.5.2. Arc testing of the TASER®. Each time a SF member is issued a TASER® from the
  Armory, the member is required to conduct a function check. The function check will consist
  of an Arc test using the following procedures.
       7.5.2.1. Receive cartridges and holster, if applicable, from the Armorer and secure them
       per your unit‘s policy.
       7.5.2.2. Receive the TASER® butt first from the Armorer and ensure it is safe with no
       cartridge loaded.
       7.5.2.3. Step back one step and point the TASER® upward ensuring no one is at risk of
       being accidentally tased. (Note: Anytime the unit is placed on fire, ensure the laser
       pointer is not pointed at a person‘s eye).
       7.5.2.4. Place the TASER® on fire, shout out ―Arc Test‖ one time and pull the trigger,
       allowing the unit to cycle long enough to ensure proper operation. Ensure the TASER®
       has sufficient battery life as defined in the lesson plan.
       7.5.2.5. Prior to holstering the TASER®, ensure a cartridge is inserted and the unit is
       ready for duty.
7.6. TASER® Utilization. Many situations that begin as standoffs have the potential to escalate
to lethal force. Early, aggressive use of a non-lethal weapon like electronic control devices can
prevent many of these situations from escalating to deadly force levels. TASERs® are
considered non-lethal force and may be utilized when the subject is actively resisting or is
noncompliant and demonstrating willingness and the ability to harm themselves or others (e.g.
emotionally disturbed persons). NOTE: In the event a subject armed with a TASER® attacks a
Security Forces member, they are authorized to use the minimum amount of force necessary to
ensure the safety of themselves or others, up to and including the use of deadly force.
  7.6.1. Employing Tasers. Users must comply with the use of force continuum. Immediately
  prior to firing a Taser, the Security Forces member will shout Taser! Taser! Taser! in a loud,
  clear manner to prevent other Security Forces members from perceiving that a firearm
  discharge has occurred between them and subject. It is recommended, if possible, Security
  Forces members have one or more accompanying Security Forces members providing lethal
  coverage in the event the Taser fails to incapacitate the subject. NOTE: The Taser will not
  be intentionally fired at the face or throat of a subject. The Taser has a Class IIIa laser pointer
  and could be harmful in shinning into a person‘s eyes at distances shorter than 18 meters.
  7.6.2. Taser Use in Conjunction with Pepper Spray. Taser‘s may be utilized in lieu of
  pepper spray, prior to use of pepper spray or following the use of pepper spray if the spray is
  ineffective at incapacitating the subject. CAUTION! If the subject has been heavily sprayed
  94                                                  AFMAN31-222          18 FEBRUARY 2009

  with pepper spray that uses an alcohol based carrier (check the label to see if the spray
  contains alcohol) then SF personnel must wait thirty seconds for the alcohol to evaporate
  before the Taser can be used. This is to keep the electrical discharge of the Taser from
  igniting the alcohol that may have saturated the subject‘s clothing. If a water-based carrier is
  used in the pepper spray, there is no requirement to wait to use the Taser.
  7.6.3. Reporting and Recording Taser Utilization. MAJCOMs will determine the need for
  any periodic reporting of Taser use and develop procedures accordingly. Initial reporting will
  occur within 24 hours with basic incident facts. Units that utilize a Taser while subduing a
  subject will send an after action report to AFSFC/SFOP within 30 days of the incident
  utilizing the lessons learned format in AFI 31-201. These reports will be published in the
  lessons learned section of the HQ AFSFC web site at https://www.mil.lackland.af.mil/afsf as
  a learning tool for all Security Forces members.
7.7. Post-Use Care. To minimize the number of Taser applications, work quickly. It is
important to stress the need for effective tactics to ensure the subject is safely and quickly
subdued or restrained. Each 5-second duty cycle is a ―window of opportunity,‖ once a subject
has been incapacitated with a Taser, the covering SF member should move in and handcuff the
subject. NOTE: It is recommended that photographs be taken of probe impact sites and any
other related injuries and place into the case file.
  7.7.1. Precautions. Security Forces members must be vigilant not to step on or come in
  contact with the wires running from the Taser to the darts in the subject. It is safe to handcuff
  the subject while the Taser is actively incapacitating the subject as long as contact is not made
  with the wires (refer to manufacturer provided training for further information).
  7.7.2. Removing Taser Darts. Security Forces members may remove the darts from the
  subject once the subject has been handcuffed and is no longer actively resisting. Personnel
  will don personal protection equipment (rubber gloves) prior to removing the darts to prevent
  exposure to blood borne pathogens. Areas of the skin penetrated by the darts should be wiped
  with an alcohol pad or other first aid wipe and covered with adhesive dressing as required.
  Darts, which have penetrated the skin, should be treated as biohazards. Darts should be
  carefully placed, sharp tip first, back into the expended cartridge bores and secured with tape.
  Photographs shall be taken of the darts impact sites and any other related injuries and placed
  into the case file. The cartridge should be labeled, secured and placed into the evidence
  locker IAW AFI 31-206, Security Forces Investigations Program. EXCEPTIONS: If the
  dart cannot be easily removed (such as being impaled in bones, throat, or groin), Security
  Forces members will either transport subject to the installation medical facility for treatment
  or obtain other medical assistance as necessary. Additionally, if a subject requests medical
  assistance, such assistance must be provided to the subject in a timely manner.
  7.7.3. Any suspect subdued with a Taser must be transported to a medical treatment facility,
  as soon as practical, for attention by a health care professional. Medical personnel should be
  contacted to conduct transport. However, if it is impractical/impossible for medical personnel
  to transport the suspect, two Security Forces personnel may conduct the transport.
       7.7.3.1. Once the suspect is initially cleared by a health care professional, the suspect
       should be transported to a detention facility.
AFMAN31-222         18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                95

       7.7.3.2. Once the transport has been completed, receiving Security Forces members at the
       detention facility should be advised that the suspect has been Tased and identify where
       the suspect was hit.
       7.7.3.3. The suspect should be continually monitored for a minimum of one-hour from
       the time of the initial Taser strike.
7.8. Evidence Collection.       The expended cartridge and Anti Felon IDs (AFIDS) will be
collected and secured as evidence. Photographs shall be taken of the dart impact sites and any
other related injuries and placed in the case file. The cartridge should be labeled, secured, and
placed into the evidence locker IAW AFI 31- 206, Security Forces Investigations Program.
7.9. Recording and Reporting TASER Use. SF members who use a Taser while subduing a
subject will ensure to report such actions on AF Form 53, Security Forces Desk Blotter and AF
Form 3545, Incident Report. Notify the MAJCOM/A7S within 24 hours of the basic incident
facts. Units will send an After Action Report to the AFSFC/SFOP within 30 days of the incident,
using the Lessons Learned format in AFI 31-201. These reports will be published in the Lessons
Learned section of the JLLIS web site at https://www.jllis.mil/usaf as a learning tool for all
Security Forces members.
7.10. Transporting and Carrying/Employing Tasers on Aircraft. If traveling on an aircraft,
the Taser must be placed in a hard case in your checked luggage except when performing
prisoner escort duties. During prisoner escort duties the Taser will only be used in the ―Drive
Stun‖ mode (no cartridge inserted).
  7.10.1. Transporting Tasers on Aircraft. Although the Taser is not classified as a firearm,
  you should advise Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officials prior to baggage
  screening that you are carrying the Taser in your checked baggage. Additionally, some
  airlines may require notification so coordinate with the airline prior to travel and inform the
  agent when checking in. Remove the batteries and cartridges from the Taser and store
  separately in the hard case. The X26 model must be stored with the Digital Power
  Magazine (DPM) inserted at all times. Failure to do so may result in software
  corruption, loss of date/time settings, or X26 failure. If shipping a Taser, store the Taser in
  a hard case as stated above.
  7.10.2. Carrying/Employing Tasers on Aircraft. Per Taser Policy and for safety reasons,
  Taser projectile darts may not be used within the confines of an aircraft. Tasers may only be
  used in the ―Drive Stun‖ mode while within the confines of an aircraft. Training of
  individuals specifically tasked for escort missions on aircraft will not involve firing the
  projectiles and will stress that only the ―Drive Stun‖ mode may be used.
7.11. Military Working Dog Interaction with Taser. To allow the handler to focus on
activities associated with the Canine, it is not recommended that the canine handlers use or be
issued Tasers. However, this is permissible if done according to guidance from the Installation
Chief of Security Forces.
  96                                                  AFMAN31-222          18 FEBRUARY 2009


                                           Chapter 8

                                  PERSONNEL SEARCHES

8.1. Overview. Security Forces search suspects for weapons or evidence. All apprehended
suspects will undergo a search prior to transport. This ensures the safety of Security Forces and
suspects. The apprehending Security Forces member makes the decision to frisk or search. Base
this decision on the situation. Searching is the most potentially dangerous time for the Security
Forces member, and if not properly conducted, may result in serious bodily injury or death.
Search techniques exist to minimize these dangers. The person who fails to take full advantage
of these techniques poses a threat to themselves and their fellow Security Forces members. A
good rule of thumb is to remember that all apprehended suspects are potentially dangerous and
you must afford yourself all possible protection.
8.2. Safety Rules. Search apprehended suspects as soon as possible after apprehension unless
the situation dictates otherwise. Always handcuff the suspect prior to the search. You should
not search an individual without the aid of another Security Forces member. The assisting
Security Forces member participating in the search provides additional suspect control and
reduces the probability of the suspect escalating the risk. For military working dog teams, the
dog is considered the assisting member and is positioned as required. Do not draw a weapon
unless its use is imminent or the reason for apprehension would justify its use.
8.3. Search Decisions. You must make an on-the-scene decision and assessment of each
situation to decide which search method to employ. No matter which one you use, conduct it
quickly and thoroughly. For quickness, search systematically; for thoroughness, never pat or run
your hands over the suspect lightly—grab or squeeze every inch of the suspect‘s clothing as you
search. Although a Security Forces member can start a search from either side, it should always
start from the same side the hand rotation technique is applied to maintain effective control over
the suspect.
8.4. Precautionary Check. Make a ―precautionary check‖ of the suspect prior to the actual
search. The precautionary check will consist of verbal communication with the suspect. Ask the
suspect if he/she has any sharp objects on their person (e.g., needles, razor blades, or knives).
Regardless of the suspect‘s reply, proceed with caution to determine the location of any objects.
Remember you are in a high-risk environment for health hazards such as exposure to HIV,
Hepatitis B Virus, or other blood-borne pathogens resulting from a stick or cut.
8.5. Types of Searches. There are three types of searches you should use; standing, kneeling,
and prone. Apply handcuffs before beginning any search in accordance with the procedures
outlined in Chapter 9. See AFMAN 31-219, USAF Military Working Dog (MWD) Program, for
detailed instructions on how to conduct searches with a military working dog.
   8.5.1. Standing Search. The standing search is primarily used on suspects who do not appear
   dangerous or violent, or are not so drunk/drugged that they can stand under their own power.
       8.5.1.1. With the Security Forces member at the suspect‘s right rear, the assisting
       Security Forces member should take an over-watch position in front of the suspect,
       opposite the side of the searching Security Forces member, to maintain surveillance of
       the search procedures. The assistant must remain close enough to physically aid the
       searching Security Forces member if necessary.
AFMAN31-222        18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                               97

      8.5.1.2. The searching Security Forces member will instruct the suspect to turn his/her
      head facing the opposite direction of intended approach. Next, grab the handcuff link
      chain with your hand palm down. Keep your weapon or strong side away from the
      suspect while placing your foot directly behind and centered between the suspect‘s feet.
      Instruct the suspect to keep his/her head up and knees flexed. If the suspect becomes
      uncooperative or aggressive, control is gained by pulling the handcuffs down and back to
      keep the suspect off balance (Figure 8.1.).
Figure 8.1. Standing Search.




      8.5.1.3. Search the suspect‘s entire side from the position you are in. If the suspect is
      wearing a hat, remove it, and have your over watch carefully check the hat for sharp
      objects, weapons, and contraband. Pay particular attention to the area beneath the
  98                                                 AFMAN31-222          18 FEBRUARY 2009

       sweatband and seams. After searching the hat, drop it on the ground behind the suspect.
       Use the hat as a container for any items taken from the suspect.
       8.5.1.4. Run your fingers through the suspect‘s hair and around the left side of the head.
       Then search the back of the suspect‘s neck (Figure 8.2.)
Figure 8.2. Standing Search.




       8.5.1.5. Work your way down the side of the suspect‘s back, checking across the spine to
       the left side and down from the collar to the waist (Figure 8.3.).
AFMAN31-222        18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                               99


Figure 8.3. Standing Search.




      8.5.1.6. Search the suspect‘s side to the armpit and down the underside of the arm to the
      suspect‘s hand.
      8.5.1.7. Check the rest of the suspect‘s arm from the hand to the shoulder. Search the
      suspect‘s throat and chest working down to the waist (Figure 8.4.).

Figure 8.4. Standing Search.




      8.5.1.8. Starting at the suspect‘s waist, in front, search the waistline to the small of the
      back (Figure 8.5.).
AFMAN31-222        18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                  101


Figure 8.5. Standing Search.




      8.5.1.9. Move your left foot back for balance and crouch down. Pull the handcuffs
      downward and back to maintain control.
      8.5.1.10. Search the suspect‘s buttocks and groin area. Search down the inside of the
      suspect‘s left leg, inside the top of the left shoe, under the arch of the shoe, and back up
      the outside of the suspect‘s left leg to the waist (Figures 8.6., 8.7., and 8.8.).

      8.5.1.11. After searching the suspect‘s left side, assume the initial control position.
      8.5.1.12. Place your left hand over your right hand and the handcuff linking chain. You
      are now executing what is commonly known as the ―crossover.‖
      8.5.1.13. Slide your right hand out and grip the linking chain with your left hand (Figure
      8.9.).
AFMAN31-222        18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                               105


Figure 8.9. Standing Search.




      8.5.1.14. Turn your body so your left side is towards the suspect‘s back and your right
      side is at a 45-degree angle from the suspect. Place your left foot directly behind and
      centered between the suspect‘s feet. Again, direct the suspect to look away from the side
      you are searching (Figure 8.10.).
106                                                  AFMAN31-222          18 FEBRUARY 2009


Figure 8.10. Standing Search.




      8.5.1.15. Search the suspect‘s right side using the same procedures used for the left side.
      During any part of your search, if the suspect violently resists, pull the handcuffs down
      and back to maintain control.
  8.5.2. Kneeling Search. The kneeling search is similar to the standing search, and is used
  primarily on suspects where more control is desired. Security Forces members may opt to use
  the kneeling search for suspects that are taller, have a huge body mass, or when it is felt that
  more control is needed. Use the same procedures/techniques identified above for standing
  searches when conducting a kneeling search.

  8.5.3. Prone Search. The prone search is used primarily on suspects who appear to be
  dangerous or violent, or are so drunk/drugged that they cannot stand under their own power.
      8.5.3.1. Place the suspect in the prone position with their hands cuffed behind his/her
      back and feet spread wide apart.
      8.5.3.2. Direct the suspect to keep his/her head turned away from the search side at all
      times.
      8.5.3.3. The assisting Security Forces member is positioned approximately six feet from
      the suspect‘s head in the ―over watch‖ position. The assisting Security Forces member
      will position himself/herself over the suspect and opposite the side of the searching
      member.
      8.5.3.4. The searching Security Forces member positions him/herself over the suspect on
      the right side of the handcuffed suspect and searches the suspect‘s left side.
      8.5.3.5. The searching member will place his/her left knee on the suspect‘s right leg at the
      knee area and keeps his/her right foot flat on the ground next to the suspect‘s side
      (Figure 8.11.).
AFMAN31-222         18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                109


Figure 8.l2. Prone Search.




       8.5.3.6. If the suspect attempts to struggle, the searching member will drop their right
       knee onto the suspect‘s back. Grab the suspect‘s hand and bend the palm into the wrist
       while pulling the handcuffs toward the suspect‘s head. Continue to apply pressure
       compliance techniques until control is regained.
       8.5.3.7. If the suspect is wearing a hat, have the assisting Security Forces member remove
       and search the hat before you begin your search. After the hat is searched, use it as a
       container for items taken from the suspect. With your left hand, search the outer half of
       the suspect‘s left leg from the waist down to the left knee (Figure 8.12.). Lay your palm
       down on the suspect‘s knee and instruct him to raise his/her left leg (Figure 8.13.). Use
       the palm to block a possible kick as the suspect raises his/her leg.

Figure 8.13. Prone Search.




      8.5.3.8. Search the outer leg to the foot, then the shoe, and back up the inner leg. As you
      complete the inner leg to the knee, have the suspect lower his/her foot to the ground.
      Search up the inner leg to the groin and left buttock (Figure 8.14.).
Figure 8.14. Prone Search.
AFMAN31-222        18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                   111

      8.5.3.9. Switch hands on the linking chain for control, move the suspect‘s hands and
      search the weak side of the back area from the spine to the ground to include the ribs.
      Search from waistline to the shoulder, collar, and head area.
      8.5.3.10. Next, search from the top of the shoulder, down the outside of the arm, checking
      the hand, and up the inside of the arm to the armpit. With your palm up, reach between
      the arm and body and grab the front side of the shoulder and roll the suspect back.
      8.5.3.11. Place your right arm in the crook of the suspect‘s left arm and roll him/her back
      until their left side is slightly off the surface. Lean your right knee against the suspect‘s
      back for balance (Figure 8.15.).
Figure 8.15. Prone Search.




      8.5.3.12. With your left hand, release the linking chain and search the suspect‘s
      waistband from the middle of the back to the belt buckle (Figure 8.16.).

Figure 8.16. Prone Search.




      8.5.3.13. Search the suspect‘s lower left abdomen and groin, then up the front side of the
      suspect‘s torso to the throat (Figure 8.17.).
Figure 8.17. Prone Search.




      8.5.3.14. Return the suspect to the prone search position.
      8.5.3.15. After searching the suspect‘s left side, you are ready to search the suspect‘s
      right side.
AFMAN31-222        18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                113

      8.5.3.16. Cross your right hand over your left hand. Place your right hand in the small of
      the suspect‘s back while keeping your left hand on the linking chain of the handcuffs
      (Figure 8.18.).
Figure 8.18. Prone Search.




      8.5.3.17. Keep pressure on the suspect‘s back to maintain control. Rise up and step over
      the suspect‘s buttocks (Figure 8.19.).

Figure 8.20. Prone Search.




       8.5.3.19. Instruct the suspect to turn his/her head to the opposite side you will search.
       Search the suspect‘s right side using the same procedures/techniques outlined for
       searching the suspect‘s left side. NOTE: The above search procedures are for right-
       handed individuals. Left-handed persons may start the procedures from the opposite side.
       8.5.3.20. After the search is completed, bring the suspect to a standing position. If the
       suspect is unable to stand alone, roll them onto their side.
8.6. Opposite-Gender Searches. Security Forces members may search any suspect‘s handbag,
briefcase, overcoat, or luggage. However, suspects are normally only subjected to bodily search
by a same-gender Security Forces member.
  8.6.1. Procedures. When a search is necessary, a same-gender Security Forces member
  should conduct the search. However, if no same-gender Security Forces members are on
  scene and there is no immediate danger to the apprehending Security Forces, the suspect will
  be:
       8.6.1.1. Handcuffed with hands behind their back, palms out (except for pregnant females
       who are handcuffed with their hands in front of their body).
       8.6.1.2. Transport the suspect to a suitable location for a thorough search by a same-
       gender Security Forces member or medical personnel.
  8.6.2. Exigent Circumstances. Security Forces members may perform a ―simple frisk‖ for
  weapons on an opposite-gender suspect if:
       8.6.2.1. No same-gender Security Forces member or medical personnel are available.

      8.6.2.2. The situation is of such urgency that it warrants a frisk to prevent decreasing
      security or endangering the Security Forces member performing the apprehension.
      NOTE: In situations where a Security Forces member must perform a frisk of an
      opposite-gender suspect, advise the control center of the situation and have another
      Security Forces member witness the frisk.

                                           Chapter 9
                  HANDCUFFING AND SUBJECT TRANSPORTATION

9.1. Overview. The decision to handcuff is subject to sound professional judgment based on the
facts of the specific incident. Security Forces most commonly handcuff to affect an
apprehension. However, there is no defined criteria that can match your judgment. Handcuffing
is never automatic.
  9.1.1. Key Considerations. Key considerations include the following.
       9.1.1.1. Nature of the offense committed.
       9.1.1.2. Demeanor/violence potential of the suspect (e.g., cooperative, threatening,
       frightened, etc.).
       9.1.1.3. Number of suspects involved.
       9.1.1.4. Controls needed.
       9.1.1.5. Your perception of the threat to your own personal safety and that of innocent
       third parties.
9.2. Handcuffing Information. Handcuffs do restrain free movement. Yet handcuffs are not a
foolproof restraining system. Never think that since a suspect is restrained they are no longer a
threat. Use care, common sense, and discretion anytime you handcuff a suspect.
  9.2.1. Stepping Through Cuffs. Many criminals have adapted techniques like ―stepping
  through the cuffs,‖ which (just as the phrase implies) places the suspect‘s hands in front of
  their body. From this position the suspect could more effectively fight with Security Forces
  personnel. To prevent a suspect from stepping through the cuffs, loop the cuffs through the
  suspect‘s belt at a point below the small of his/her back prior to securing the second cuff.
  Remember a suspect with their hands cuffed in front poses a far greater threat. Consider
  cuffing to the front only if the suspect is pregnant, wounded, or has a physical handicap
  precluding cuffing behind the back.
  9.2.2. Striking Cuffs. Another tactic suspects use is striking cuffs. Striking handcuffs
  sharply on a solid object may cause ratchets to fail and release one or both cuffs. Even if only
  one ratchet fails (i.e., opens), the suspect‘s hands are free and in the one cuff scenario, the
  suspect has a weapon (the handcuffs themselves) to use against you. There are a number of
  recorded incidents where handcuffs have been used against law enforcement officers with
  deadly effect.
  9.2.3. Fixed Objects. Never handcuff a suspect to a fixed object (e.g., a sign post, chain-link
  fence, vehicle, aircraft seat, etc.). A suspect cuffed to a fixed object may be trapped in the
  case of an accident or emergency.
  9.2.4. Suspect Safety. When you apprehend a suspect, you are entirely responsible for their
  safety. As an example, when you transport a suspect, place the seat belt around them to
  ensure their safety.
9.3. When to Handcuff. The courts consider handcuffing a use of force. A U.S. Supreme Court
decision, Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386 (1989), held that a police officers‘ decision to use
force must be judged from the ―perspective of a reasonable officer, within circumstances that are
118                                                       AFMAN31-222      18 FEBRUARY 2009

often tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving.‖ This standard asks whether the Security Forces
actions are objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them. So
you must carefully weigh all factors before you handcuff someone you have apprehended.
Analyze all force situations to assure you use the minimum level of force that will safely protect
you from injury. Do not use more force than is necessary to complete an apprehension, yet keep
yourself and others free of danger.
   9.3.1. Deciding to Handcuff. As stated in Chapter 8, you must search or frisk all
   apprehended persons prior to transport. If you decide to search a suspect then you have also
   decided to handcuff, as handcuffing is an integral part of the search procedures outlined in
   Chapter 8. Remember your safety and the safety of the suspect are prime considerations. If
   the circumstances of the apprehension leave any doubt in your mind as to your safety or the
   safety of the suspect, then handcuff the suspect using the minimum level of force necessary to
   complete the handcuffing procedure.
   9.3.2. Assuring Control. During an apprehension, you may apply handcuffs to assure control
   of suspects at the apprehension site and during transport. When applying handcuffs, use
   ―reasonable‖ levels of force to:
       9.3.2.1. Achieve control of a resisting suspect.
       9.3.2.2. Maintain control during the apprehension and detention.
9.3.3. Non-resisting Suspects. If you decide to use restraining devices on a non-resisting
suspect, accomplish the application of handcuffs with reason and without injury. Telling the
suspect of your intent to apprehend and allowing the suspect to cooperate minimizes the risk of
injury.
   9.3.4. Injuries During Handcuffing. If a suspect is injured during the handcuffing stage of
   an apprehension, the first step is to seek immediate medical attention for the suspect. As soon
   as possible, provide a detailed written statement of the techniques you used and action taken
   by the apprehended suspect that caused the injury.
9.4. Handcuffing Approach. Approach all suspects in the alert stance. This stance places your
weak side towards a suspect and your weapon/strong side 45-degrees away from the suspect.
Maintain a distance of six feet or more between you and the suspect. This distance, known as the
―reactionary gap,‖ allows you to react to any sudden or aggressive moves the suspect makes.
Direct the suspect to assume the standing, kneeling, or prone position explained in Chapter 8. If
the suspect refuses, place them in the prone position using the minimum force necessary. When
you decide to apprehend a suspect, you must establish and maintain ―positive control.‖ Establish
―positive control‖ with the hand rotation position explained in Chapter 2 while controlling the
handcuffs secured to the suspect‘s wrists.
9.5. Displaying Handcuffs. You must be able to get to your handcuffs quickly. Place the
ratchet cuffs in their pouch, in a position most accessible to you. Keep the handcuffs in the
pouch with the locks on opposite sides. Ready the handcuffs for application if you must react
quickly. If flex cuffs are available, lace them through your belt. The flex cuffs must not be
visible but, with a straight pull, ready for application.
   9.5.1. Disposable Flex Cuffs. The disposable flex-cuff provides service members with a
   means of restraining and controlling suspects, prisoners, and other individuals encountered
   during crowd control. The flex-cuffs consist of a tough pliable plastic band with a self-
AFMAN31-222          18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                 119

   locking mechanism in the center of each end. When applied, the flex-cuff band circles around
   the wrists or ankles, impeding movement and securing the individual. They are lightweight
   and disposable and require a cutting tool or other instruments to remove. Applying flex-cuffs
   is similar to handcuffs, however the arresting officer should be familiar with the type of flex-
   cuffs and how to properly apply them (Refer to the manufacturers manual for more details).
9.6. How to Apply Handcuffs. Hold the handcuffs firmly in your strong hand with fingers
around the linking chain separating the handcuffs. The double bars are loaded in the ―V‖ of your
hand with the single bar down by the index finger. Apply the handcuffs to the suspect with
his/her hands behind their back, palms out, thumbs up. Do not position a suspect on a wall or
other vertical object when handcuffing. When the suspect is cooperative, handcuff him/her in
the standing position. Based on your discretion, you may inform the suspect of your intentions
to handcuff. Base the decision on circumstances that include, but not limited to, number of
assisting Security Forces members, attitude of the suspect, physical location of the apprehension,
and your experience. The following handcuffing positions provide the maximum safety for
Security Forces by directing all commands from the reactionary gap and reinforcing compliance
through positive control.
   9.6.1. Standing Position. To place handcuffs on a suspect in the standing position you must:
       9.6.1.1. Position the suspect away from you with their hands behind their back, palms
       out, thumbs up. Spread their legs shoulder width apart with their toes pointing outward.
       Direct the suspect to bend forward slightly at the waist with their head up and turned
       away from your avenue of approach.
       9.6.1.2. With the handcuffs in your strong hand, approach the suspect keeping your weak
       side towards the suspect and extend your weak arm to maintain a reactionary gap.
       9.6.1.3. Apply the hand rotation technique with your weak hand and place the single bar
       of the lower cuff on top of the suspect‘s nearest wrist. Push downward sharply on the
       cuff and up on the hand allowing the single bar to swing around the wrist (Figure 9.1.).
       Secure the ratchet by sliding your weak hand up the suspect‘s hand and close the cuff.
       NOTE: This is one of the most dangerous points in the cuffing procedure. Many
       suspects have attacked law enforcement personnel with the ratchet of the free cuff
       inflicting serious injury. DO NOT DELAY/HESITATE AT THIS POINT IN THE
       CUFFING PROCEDURE.

Figure 9.1. Applying Handcuffs.




      9.6.1.4. Once the first cuff is secure, immediately apply the other cuff to the suspect‘s
      other wrist.
      9.6.1.5. Double lock the handcuffs by depressing the locking pins with the double locking
      tip of the handcuff key.
  9.6.2. Kneeling Position. Use the same procedures/techniques identified above for the
  standing position when placing handcuffs on a suspect in the kneeling position.
  9.6.3. Prone Position. To place handcuffs on a suspect in the prone position you must:
  9.6.3.1. Position the suspect away from you in the final challenge position. Instruct the
  suspect to slowly drop to their knees and then fall forward catching themselves with their
  hands. The suspect will lower him/herself to the ground and place their arms parallel to their
  shoulders with palms up. Then direct the suspect to turn their head away from your avenue of
  approach.
  9.6.3.2. Take up a position 45-degrees to your strong side and to the rear of the suspect.
  Direct the suspect to raise both hands off the ground and place them into the small of their
  back with palms out and thumbs up. Approach the suspect from your weak side and lower
  your center of gravity. Avoid stepping between the suspect‘s legs, be cautious, and maintain
  your balance.
  9.6.3.3. Grab the ring and middle finger of the suspect‘s nearest hand and place the single bar
  of the cuff on top of the suspect‘s wrist. Push down sharply on the cuff and up on the hand
  allowing the single bar to swing around the suspect‘s wrist. Secure the ratchet by sliding your
  weak hand up the suspect‘s hand and pushing up to close the cuff. Immediately grab the
  suspect‘s other hand with your weak hand and apply the remaining cuff in the same manner.
AFMAN31-222         18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                121

  9.6.3.4. Double lock the handcuffs by depressing the locking pins with the double locking tip
  of the handcuff key.
9.7. Removing Handcuffs. Maintain control of the suspect until you determine removal of the
handcuffs is appropriate.
  9.7.1. Procedures for Removing Handcuffs.            To remove the ratchet handcuffs from a
  suspect you must:
       9.7.1.1. Place the suspect in the standing, kneeling, or prone position.
       9.7.1.2. Approach and use tactical positioning for removal identical to placement.
       9.7.1.3. Grab the linking chain palm up. Once the cuff is released, tell the suspect to
       rotate the free arm from the cuff slowly and place his/her hand on the back of their head
       and keep it there until told to do otherwise (Figure 9.2.). Right-handed Security Forces
       members remove the left cuff first. Left-handed Security Forces members remove the
       right cuff first. Regardless of which cuff is removed first, immediately close the ratchet
       of the removed cuff so the suspect cannot use the open ratchet as a weapon against you.
       9.7.1.4. Keeping your weak hand on the linking chain, remove the key and place it in the
       opposite lock with your strong hand. Repeat the same directions to the suspect for the
       opposite hand. NOTE: Never let go of the linking chain.
Figure 9.2. Removing Handcuffs.




       9.7.1.5. With the key in your strong hand, unlock and remove the other cuff, and step
       back without delay. Immediately close the second cuff so the suspect cannot use the
       open ratchet as a weapon if they break away.
122                                                    AFMAN31-222          18 FEBRUARY 2009

       9.7.1.6. Direct the suspect to remove their hands from the back of their head and release
       the suspect as instructed by higher or competent authority.
9.8. Transporting Suspects. The process of transporting suspects is one of the most dangerous
activities in which any officer may engage. It has many times been referred to as the ―weakest
link in the realm of suspect security.‖ It is generally viewed as the phase of officer/suspect
contact offering the greatest potential for escape. Therefore, the officer must be highly vigilant
and adhere to time proven procedures and practices. In almost every case of an escape or injury
during an escort or transport, the suspect has taken advantage of a procedural lapse on the part of
the transporting officer(s). Remember, you as a Security Forces member must recognize that the
ultimate goal of escorting and transporting is to reach the destination free of officer or suspect
incident or injury. Your safety is paramount when transporting suspects in custody. The
transporting Security Forces member(s) should search the suspect for weapons prior to placing
the suspect(s) in the transport vehicle and search the vehicle before and after transport to ensure
the suspect has not attempted to hide contraband, weapons, or other items of evidentiary value.
   9.8.1. Successful Transport. Suspect transport consists of the controlled and secure
   movement of a suspect(s) in custody from one point to another. Remember transporting is
   dangerous. Carelessness and the failure to follow established procedures are the major causes
   of Security Forces injuries. As a transporting team member, you are both legally and
   professionally responsible for the safety and security of the subjects. This process should be
   conducted humanely, professionally, and efficiently with a minimum of public display.
   Successful transport consists of the following critical components.
       9.8.1.1. Preparation of your attitude toward the serious nature of the activity, a proactive
       sense of risk assessment, and strict adherence to procedures.
       9.8.1.2. As much as possible, preplan the specific route of the transport.
       9.8.1.3. Establish a line of communication to be maintained throughout the transport.
       Remember to keep the suspect in sight constantly.
       9.8.1.4. Increase your attention as you approach your destination since this may be the
       suspects ―last chance‖ to act.
       9.8.1.5. Never inform the suspect of more than the required amount of information prior
       to transport in order to minimize the risk of preplanning on the part of the suspect.
       9.8.1.6. You should personally conduct the search of the suspect to be transported.
       Assume nothing—verify everything.
       9.8.1.7. You should personally apply and check restraint devices prior to transport to
       assure security.
       9.8.1.8. You should personally search and secure the transport vehicle prior to and after
       the transport.
   9.8.2. Transport Procedures. The transport vehicle integrity is vital. Transport vehicles fall
   into two categories: standard passenger type vehicles and those designed and adapted for
   transporting suspects. Based on frequency of use, the passenger type vehicle transport
   procedures should be trained on and demonstrated. However, most of these principles and
   procedures are generally adaptable to most of the contemporary transport vehicles utilized.
   NOTE: Overseas units that have vehicles with the driver‘s steering wheel located on the right
AFMAN31-222         18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                   123

  should follow the same procedures; however suspect should always be placed opposite to the
  driver.
      9.8.2.1. Inspect the transport vehicle prior to transport. As the transporting officer your
      first task is to become totally familiar with the vehicle security devices (shields, screens,
      radio, etc.) that enhance your safety and security. Search the area where the suspect will
      be seated thoroughly. If the seat can be removed, do so for closer/greater inspection ease
      and accuracy. Look for locations (seams, tears, crevices, etc.) where a suspect could
      place contraband or weapons. Remember specialized security devices designed into the
      vehicle should augment your safety.
      9.8.2.2. Dual Officer/Single Suspect Placement in Transport Vehicles.
           9.8.2.2.1. Once the suspect has been searched and restrained following proper
           procedures, the suspect should be escorted to the right rear seat. The officer will still
           secure the suspect while opening the door for the suspect.
           9.8.2.2.2. During this phase of the escort/transport, the officer must remain to the
           rear of the suspect in order to prevent a potential attack. The suspect is now advised
           to first sit on the seat and then bring their legs into the vehicle.
           9.8.2.2.3. The officer then proceeds to take his left forearm and place it under the
           suspects chin, verbally directing and slowly pushing his head backward while the
           officer applies the suspect seat belt.
           9.8.2.2.4. The supportive transporting officer now enters the vehicle from the left
           rear and remains seated during transport directly behind the driver. Primary attention
           for this officer is directed toward the subject.
      9.8.2.3. Dual Officer/Two Suspect Placement in Transport Vehicles.
           9.8.2.3.1. Once searched and restrained, the first suspect should be escorted to the
           right rear passenger door. He/she should be placed into the vehicle following the
           previously stated procedures but positioned in the middle part of the rear seat and
           secured with the seat belt.
           9.8.2.3.2. The second searched and restrained suspect is then placed into the right
           rear seat and the seat belt applied.
           9.8.2.3.3. The supporting officer now assumes a position in the left rear passenger
           seat behind the driver.
  9.8.3. Transport of Combative suspects. There are usually some indicative signs that a
  suspect is going to be combative prior to placing inside the vehicle, if not then place in
  vehicle, or explain to them what is going to happen and give the prisoner a few minutes to
  comprehend and calm down prior to placing inside the vehicle. Communication and patience
  is key here. If a suspect becomes combative, kicking vehicle, seats, spitting, yelling, kicking
  out windows officers should try the following:
      9.8.3.1. Safely stop the vehicle if not already stopped, verbally advise the suspect you
      will call for backup and remove them from the car.
124                                                     AFMAN31-222           18 FEBRUARY 2009

       9.8.3.2. For kicking, place them in leg shackles that will be routed through handcuffs, or
       attached too handcuffs with additional leg shackles or zip ties behind their back, and
       placed back inside the back seat facedown and belted in to get transported.
       9.8.3.3. If spitting, again stop the vehicle, verbally advise the prisoner you will call for
       backup and remove them from the car. And pull up the front of their shirt tail over their
       face if possible, place a paper bag over their head, or a clean old t-shirt over their face, or
       a new pair of pantyhose, before placing them back in the vehicle, Or after assistance
       arrives, remove from vehicle and place back inside face down on the back seat belted in
       or face back towards the back of the seat, this may take two or more officers to
       accomplish either or both of these tasks.
       9.8.3.4. If the prisoner is more combative than that and it becomes unsafe to try tofight
       with them, Contact medical personnel (Paramedics) or an ambulance, needs to respond
       and with assistance of the paramedics restrain (Cuff, Zip Tie, Curlex Tie) place the
       prisoner on a gurney for their own safety (and yours) for transport to a medical facility
       for medical attention or psychological evaluation prior to getting to booking.
       9.8.3.5. Whatever is done, document well with reasons for actions taken and/or
       photograph configuration(s) used for transportation, if extremely combative have
       competent medical personnel examine the prisoner before booking.
9.9. Other Considerations. Ideally, your vehicle should have a safety screen between the front
and rear seats. When you are working as a team in a patrol vehicle equipped with a safety
screen, place the suspect in the rear seat on the passenger side and the patrol rider in the front
passenger seat next to the driver. ALWAYS USE SEAT BELTS for every person in the vehicle.
NOTE: At no time should a one-person patrol transport more than one suspect if the vehicle is
not equipped with a safety screen unless specifically approved by the supervisor on duty and
entered into the SF blotter.
9.10. Opposite-Gender Transports. When transporting suspects of the opposite-gender, you
should ask another Security Forces member or an NCO of the same gender as the suspect to
accompany you. Follow this procedure to preclude any charges of impropriety. If a same-
gender individual is not available, notify the control center of your location, approximate
distance to the designated location, odometer reading/starting mileage and departure time. Upon
arrival at the designated location, notify the control center of arrival time and ending mileage.
9.11. Escort Procedures. Escorting is related most frequently to the movement of suspects on
foot. Normally it is limited in distance, i.e., to and from the transport vehicle, from an area of
apprehension to a secure area, etc. It should be remembered that it does normally represent the
initial continuation of contact between the officer and suspect, now moving into the phase
centered around the transport process. For this reason it should be used as a time to reinforce
and/or establish strict adherence to procedures by both participants.
   9.11.1. Standard Escort (No Handcuffs).
       9.11.1.1. The suspect is approached form the side/rear by the officer(s) who initiates the
       Wrist/Elbow Escort Technique (Figure 9.3.).
       9.11.1.2. The suspect is now guided to the appropriate destination in a relatively safe and
       secure manner.
AFMAN31-222        18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                125

  9.11.2. Standard Escort (Handcuffed).
      9.11.2.1. The suspect has already been handcuffed to the rear and searched thoroughly.
      The officer(s) moves to the side/rear on the right side of the suspect.
      9.11.2.2. The officer rotates the suspect‘s right hand with the officer‘s left hand.
      9.11.2.3. The officer‘s right hand is placed on the right elbow of the suspect in order to
      stabilize and secure the suspect during escort (Figure 9.4.).

  9.11.3. Reverse Escort (Handcuffed).
      9.11.3.1. Once the suspect has been thoroughly searched and handcuffed, the officer
      moves to the left side/rear position of the suspect.
      9.11.3.2. The officer now slides his left arm under the suspect‘s left arm and initiates a
      Reverse Wrist Lock Position on the suspect‘s left hand/arm.
      9.11.3.3. The officer can additionally reinforce the suspect‘s captured left hand and arm
      with his free right hand and arm (Figure 9.5.).
      9.11.3.4. Or the officer can secure the suspect and keep his right hand and arm free.
      9.11.3.5. The additional positive aspect of this technique is the fact that the suspect is
      continually destabilized by walking backward throughout the entire escort sequence.

                                            Chapter 10
                               VEHICLE STOPPING DEVICES


10.1. Introduction. Many types of barriers and vehicle control devices are available to help
entry controllers control access to installations and facilities. Active barriers and vehicle
stopping devices are not considered weapons; they are real property installed equipment that
provide a non-lethal capability to stop a vehicle. Barrier deployment could be considered as a
use of force and the principles of the USAF use of force policy normally apply to their
employment, as described in paragraph 10.4 of this chapter. This chapter applies to both
CONUS/OCONUS locations.
10.2. Nomenclature. Vehicle stopping devices may be classified in four general categories.
   10.2.1. Permanent Active Barriers. These barriers are fixed infrastructure. They consist of a
   barrier system, a safety warning system, and an activation system. Barriers may be bollards,
   plates, cables, beams, spikes, or drums that are recessed or stowed to allow normal traffic
   flow, then deployed to block access or disable vehicles when activated. The safety warning
   system may include visual and audible signals to indicate the presence of the barrier system
   and to warn drivers and bystanders of imminent barrier deployment. The activation system is
   the method by which the system is deployed, typically a switch or button used by the sentry.
   Permanent active barriers are constructed IAW the Uniform Facility Code (UFC) 4-022-01,
   Security Engineering: Entry Control Facilities/Access Control Points, and UFC 4-022-02,
   Security Engineering: Design and Selection of Vehicle Barriers, and optimized to local
   conditions.
   10.2.2. Portable Active Barriers. These barriers are mobile and can be moved from place to
   place. DoD-approved portable barrier systems are identified in AFTTP (I) 3-2.45, Tactical
   Employment of Nonlethal Weapons, available at http://www.e-publishing.af.mil.
   10.2.3. Field Expedient Active Barriers. Field expedient barriers may be as simple as using a
   large vehicle to block traffic. The activation system could be a radio connection between the
   entry controller and the vehicle driver. The warning system, if required, may simply be an
   emergency light on the blocking vehicle.
   10.2.4. Portable Disabling Devices. Portable devices consist of the wide variety of tools that
   may be placed or thrown in front of or at a vehicle to disable it. DoD-approved portable
   disabling devices are identified in AFTTP (I) 3-2.45, http://www.e-publishing.af.mil.
10.3. Deployment Considerations. Barrier and device placement must be optimized with
respect to sentry location and critical assets. It is vital that the sentry has enough time to detect
an unauthorized entry attempt and deploy the barrier or disabling device. When deployed in a
joint environment, ensure use of barriers is consistent with JP 3-15, Joint Doctrine for Barriers,
Obstacles, and Mine Warfare, and with current COCOM or Unified Command directives.
   10.3.1. Position. Vehicles must be channeled into the barrier or disabling device.
   Fixed/passive barriers prevent a vehicle from driving around the active barriers. Fixed
   barriers may be natural (landscaping, boulders, dense trees, ditches) or manmade (walls/high
   curbs, at least 18 inches). For barriers, the surrounding terrain is sculpted through
   construction or landscaping to ensure traffic is funneled into the barrier. Portable barriers
AFMAN31-222         18 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                  129

  should be deployed with passive vehicle barriers (for example ―jersey‖-type concrete berms)
  or with effective use of terrain to ensure the vehicle is contained. Deploying man-portable
  disabling devices can be very difficult: the sentry should attempt to position him/herself safely
  on advantageous terrain or coordinate with other posts and patrols to funnel the vehicle into a
  zone where the device can be employed with effect.
  10.3.2. Time. The sentry must have the maximum amount of time possible to activate the
  barrier. The rule of thumb is the barrier deployment requires a minimum of 9 seconds from
  the moment the sentry detects unauthorized entry until barriers are fully deployed.
  Deployment time includes ideal sentry reaction time (3 seconds), safety warnings (minimum 4
  second delay before the barrier closes), and barrier deployment time (2 seconds). Maximizing
  sentry reaction time can be achieved in several mutually supporting ways:
      10.3.2.1. Distance. The barriers must be placed as far as possible from the sentry
      position. Positioning and distance must also account for channeling, as well as the stand-
      off between the barrier and nearby assets and infrastructure. Ideally, minimum straight-
      line distances will be greater then what a high performance, commercially-available
      vehicle could cover in 9 seconds. Reverse curves (S-curves) increase the distance the
      vehicle must cover, as well as decreasing the speed that vehicle can achieve, which
      decreases the distance traversed in 9 seconds. Reverse curves may be achieved with
      serpentine (bollards, barriers, swing gates) or built into the road geometry.
      10.3.2.2. Speed and Acceleration. The entry point design must also restrict vehicle speed
      and acceleration to allow more time for barrier activation. This can be done through
      traffic ―serpentines‖ or other traffic calming devices, both before and after the gate.
      Speed humps, speed steps, ―jutter‖ bars, and low friction road surfaces also constrain
      vehicle speed and acceleration. If space is constrained, traffic calming after the sentry
      position is generally the most preferable. Speed limits in the Approach and Response
      zones should be not more than 25 mph (both inbound and outbound lanes), and slower at
      the gatehouse/sentry booth proper. Narrow lanes, with channeling/high curbs, also
      reduce vehicle speeds: 10 ft at the gatehouse and 12 ft before and after the gatehouse.
      Slower vehicle speeds at the active barrier reduce the potential for injuries.
      10.3.2.3. Activation. The sentry should have immediate access to the barrier activation
      switches – switches worn on the sentry‘s belt are generally the fastest. If the switch
      design does not allow immediate activation, it may be necessary to post additional
      sentries. Sentries should also have post instructions and rules of engagement that direct
      them to immediately activate vehicle barriers to prevent unauthorized entry. Activation
      switches (emergency operation) should be located outside the gatehouse, at sentry posts,
      and at the over watch position.     Disengagement of the barriers must be tamperproof
      and key controlled, separate from normal barrier operations, to prevent an aggressor from
      lowering the barrier.
      10.3.2.4. Constraints. Understandably, many locations will not have space and distance
      available to create the required nine second delay, or have existing barriers with
      insufficient delay. Therefore, commanders should assess the risk and have procedures in
      place to mitigate the lack of sentry reaction time. Procedures may include: notification to
      alert base personnel of an unauthorized entry and base wide, critical facility ―lock down‖
      procedures; maintain barriers in ―up‖ position during certain hours or FPCONs, or
130                                                   AFMAN31-222          18 FEBRUARY 2009

       supporting mobile patrol response. Effective mitigation and remediation is only limited
       by security planner creativity.
10.4. Employment and Use of Force. Although vehicle stopping devices are non-lethal
capability, and are not considered weapons, the principles of the USAF use of force policy
normally apply to their employment, unless explicit criteria for their use are established by the
commander. As a non-lethal capability, vehicle stopping devices are important security risk
mitigation tools. Commanders should direct how vehicle stopping devices will be employed
when specific conditions are met.
10.5. Training. Sentrys must be trained (and documented on individual training records) to
employ barriers and disabling devices. Active barrier employment must be regularly exercised
through realistic, but safe scenarios. Trainers will reference technical directives associated with
each barrier/device to ensure training programs meet device/barrier application, employment,
and technical standards. Training should include practical scenarios that emphasize the
commander‘s barrier employment criteria.

A2.19. Butt stock Cuff. The 12-Gauge Butt stock Cuff firmly attaches to the shotgun by sliding
over the stock. The elastic straps aid in preventing the butt stock cuff from sliding or rolling. It
holds up to seven 12-gauge cartridges for quick loading of the shotgun. The intent of the device
is to make immediately available a shotgun round of the gunner‘s choice for chambering without
resorting to the more time-consuming tactic of having to pull the round from a 25-round pouch.


Figure A2.18. Butt stock Cuff.




A2.20. 40-mm Carrying Pouch. Because the current M203 grenade load-bearing vest is ill
suited for carrying non-lethal 40mm munitions, a separate pouch is needed. 40-mm Carrying
Pouch is partitioned in a manner to provide the service member with a means of carrying not less
than six 40-mm non-lethal rounds in separate compartments. It attaches to the service member‘s
combat gear.

A2.34. M84 Flash-Bang Grenade. The M84 is a reloadable, non-fragmentation, non-lethal
flash-bang stun grenade. Each grenade has a 1- to 2-second fuse delay, with a flash capability of
1.5 to 2.5 million CP and a bang of 168 to 175 decibels. Although it is part of the NLCS, use of
the M84 is not recommended for use in crowd control situations. It is intended to provide a
means to neutralize & disorient targeted personnel. Specialty teams, such as security response
teams, and search teams may use this device effectively.
