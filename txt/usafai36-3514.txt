       3.4.2.1. Food and Beverage, Gift Shop, Development and Government/Community
       Relations, and Information and Communication managers are responsible for ensuring
       they receive a list from their vendors, and will be available to answer any questions about
       the list from the gate supervisors regarding each list. If there are any sudden changes to
       the list (such as a death or family emergency), the manager must get in touch with
USAFAI36-3514 5 JUNE 2012                                                                        17


       USAFA/ADSU directly. The vendors work for the managers and are the managers’
       responsibility.
       3.4.2.2. The USAFA/ADSU will provide the proper format for the list to each manager
       prior to each game. Managers will develop a procedure for the vendors to provide names
       of workers in advance of each event. Lists will be completed by the managers and
       submitted to USAFA/ADSU NLT 1400 hours on the Thursday before football game day.

   personnel will ensure procedures are in place to allow emergency vehicle access in the event
   of an emergency during intercollegiate events only. If the evacuation of the area is
   appropriate, the bystanders will be directed to depart using a route that neither interferes with
   emergency medical attention being provided nor the path of emergency vehicles.
   4.3.3. To ensure the ramp and the track areas are clear for emergency vehicles to enter the
   Cadet Field House for emergency response, there will be no parking of any vehicles on the
   ramp or on the track at any time unless approved by the Associate Athletic Director for
   Support (USAFA/ADS) or the Assistant Athletic Director for Facilities (USAFA/ADSF).

                            SPECIAL EVENT USAGE PROCESS

5.1. Special Events Usage Process. Special events are those activities held in the Cadet Area

   USAFA/ADSU for review and recommendation to the USAFA Event Approval Committee
   by the Directorate of Athletics’ senior staff with final approval by the Director of Athletics.
   Recommendations for approval of requests will be considered based on the following
   criteria:
       5.1.1.1. Does not conflict with any on going Directorate of Athletics or other USAFA
       events.
       5.1.1.2. Support of or in the interest of USAFA, the Directorate of Athletics, or

   5.1.2. Due to an increase in special event requests received each year, a limit of no more
   than four special events will be held during June, July, and August. Direct mission programs
   (PE, Sports Camp, Basic Cadet Training, and the fall intercollegiate season) must take
   priority over special events during the summer months. The USAFA/ADSU staff will ensure
   all special event requests for the summer months are received NLT 15 October of each year
   for consideration by the Senior Administrative staff and approval by the Director of
   Athletics.
   5.1.3. All special events require the completion of a Facility Use License Agreement
   between the USAFA and the requestor. The Facility Use License is an agreement which
   documents the USAFA/AD provision of facilities, services, and call for reimbursement from
   the external organization. The agreement holds all users of said facility accountable for any
   damages incurred. USAFA/ADSU is the OPR for completion of an agreement. All Facility
   Use License Agreements are processed through the 10th Civil Engineer Squadron (10 CES)
   and approved by the 10 CES Commander (10 CES/CC) or Deputy Commander (10
   CES/CD). Facility use Licenses are required to be submitted to CE a minimum of 30 days
   prior to the event (when possible) for processing and approval.

     5.1.3.1. Facility Use License Agreements will be reviewed annually by USAFA/ADSU
     with any changes or terminations approved by the Director of Athletics (USAFA/AD).
     External organizations will be notified, in writing, no later than 90 days prior to any
     change or termination of the license agreement.
  5.1.4. In accordance with National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) guidelines,
  reimbursable expense requirements for any group with intercollegiate athlete prospects will
  not be waived.
  5.1.5. All facility use between the 10th Forces Support Squadron (10 FSS) and USAFA/AD
  requires a non-strategic Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the two agencies. The
  MOA will be initiated by the requestor of the facilities and will be signed by USAFA/ADS,
  10 FSS Deputy Director (10 FSS/CL) and HQ USAFA Financial Management, if required.
  MOAs will be completed and signed by both parties at least 30 days prior to the use date.

             SAMPLE – CREDENTIAL LETTER TO UNIT COMMANDERS

MEMORANDUM FOR USAFA COMMANDERS/STAFF (Distribution List)

FROM: USAFA/ADS

SUBJECT: USAFA Sports Credentials for 20XX-20XX Season

1. In an effort to better manage the credentialing procedures for intercollegiate athletic events,
the Directorate of Athletics’ Events Management Office (USAFA/ADSU) has developed
USAFA Form 47, Application for Air Force Academy Athletic Event Credential, which applies
to the Football, the All Sports, and the individual sports credential (see Attachment 1). The
USAFA Form 47 is intended for use by organizations for individual and group requirements
(such as Quality Assurance Evaluators, janitorial support, plumbers, electricians, etc.). This
form is available on the e-Publishing website at www.e-publishing.af.mil. The credential request
will be used by organizational commanders solely for the purpose of authorizing, in writing,
those personnel who require access to the intercollegiate athletic events because their position
requires them to work on game day. This is a ―working‖ credential only; at no time will the
working credential be used as a game ticket to any intercollegiate athletic event.

2. Instructions on how to complete USAFA Form 47 are outlined on the reverse side of the
form. Please use the Categories codes shown on the reverse side of the USAFA Form 47 to
complete Block 1.5 for all credential application forms. If requesting a Football credential,
please use the Access Zones Guide in addition to the Categories code to complete Block 1.5 of
the USAFA Form 47.

3. The Assistant Athletic Director for Events Management (USAFA/ADSU) is the approval
authority for all intercollegiate event credentials. The All-Sports Credential is very limited and
is only for those personnel whose duty requires them to work all intercollegiate sports other than
football. For those requiring a credential for only one of the other premier sports (Volleyball,
Hockey, or Basketball), please specify that particular sport under Individual Sport Credential
(Section I, Block 1.5C). The deadline to submit the form for the fall sports (Football,
Volleyball) is (date); the deadline for the winter sports (Hockey and Basketball) is (date).

4. Forward all completed/signed USAFA Forms 47 to USAFA/ADSU. Organizations should try
to submit all of their requests at one time, if possible. Note: Please be aware that the volume of
credentials that we process is enormous. Plan accordingly and submit your applications as soon
as possible. Location for the credentialing program is in the Cadet Field House (Bldg 2169) in
the Recreational Skating Office, Room 2094. If a picture is required, the requestor will be
notified. Picture times for credentials will be during the following hours only: Monday –
Thursday, 1000 – 1400 hours. Once a credential is completed, the requestor will be contacted
for pick up.
