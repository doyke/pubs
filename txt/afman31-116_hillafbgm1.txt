                      within their respective parking lots. When more than one
                      organization is involved, commanders are encouraged to divide
                      spaces based on percentages for number of personnel. Assigned
                      spaces are identified as those spaces reserved for specific vehicles
                      such as handicapped, GOV, visitor, contract designated union
                      stewards and key personnel. However, assigned spaces will not
                      exceed 10 percent of the total spaces available at each building. Total
                      available is the number of spaces after subtracting all exclusions from
                      the total number of spaces. Exclusions include handicapped, GOV
                      and visitor spaces. The commander may use up to 10 percent of the
                      remaining total available spaces for reserve or dedicated spaces. Car
                      pool parking is a special reserved parking and not considered in the
                      total available or exclusion. All parking spaces will be marked
                      “reserved” and located according to the following priorities, based on
                      the shortest, most accessible walking distance to work areas,
                      handicap vehicles, GOVs used during duty hours, visitor vehicles,
                      key personnel vehicles, car pool vehicles and all other vehicles.
                      Note: Handicapped stalls will not be reserved for specific
                      individuals. The stalls are assigned to specific facilities and will be
                      used on a "first come" basis. Individuals will contact the responsible
                      facility commander if there are any concerns over the number of
                      stalls available.
                      2. Civil Engineering is responsible for the design, establishment and
                      construction of all roadways and parking areas on base, the
                      installation or removal of parking lot and traffic control signs and
                      signals, and the design and placement of roadblocks.
                      3. All requests for construction, installation or removal of traffic
                      signs and markings will be submitted through 75 SFS/S3O and the
                      Heavy Repair Section (75 CES/CEOH) in turn.
                      4. Parking lots will be designated as open for all personnel, car-
                      pools, or with parking decal only. See Attachment 2 of this GM for
                      the location and type of parking decals required.
                      5. Reserved and special parking areas are designated in accordance
                      with this GM.
                      6. Subdividing or changing parking slots or lot boundary lines
                      requires approval of the using organization and 75 SFS/S3O.
                      Coordinate with the local Personnel Directorate (DP) for completion
                      of labor obligations (i.e., notifying and bargaining with the Union as
                      applicable) prior to implementation and when changes will impact
                      bargaining unit civilian employees. Also, including AFGE Local
                      1592 in the coordination process for automated work orders serves as
                      informational notice to enhance timely communication.
                      7. Vehicles are prohibited from parking so that the front or rear
                  bumper extends over the sidewalk, thus enabling proper snow
                  removal.
                  8. The 75 SFS/S5L is responsible for managing the base parking lot
                  warden program. These responsibilities include maintaining a
                  complete list of parking wardens, training primary parking wardens,
                  and conducting annual program reviews of unit. The list of parking
                  wardens will be provided to the local Union on an annual basis.
Parking Wardens   1. Each organization assigned responsibility for parking lots or
                  spaces will appoint at least one parking warden. Additional parking
                  wardens may be appointed as deemed necessary by the two-letter or
                  three-letter chief. If an organization is responsible for more than one
                  parking lot, parking wardens may be appointed for each lot. Where
                  more than one organization uses a parking lot, each organization will
                  appoint a parking warden for its respective portion. However, each
                  parking lot will have a primary parking warden who will be
                  responsible for issuing and accounting for all parking decals, placards
                  and official business parking permits.
                  2. All parking warden appointments will be in writing, and a copy of
                  the letter will be sent to 75 SFS/S5L. The letter will include the
                  parking warden’s name, office symbol, duty phone, date trained, and
                  the parking lot appointed. The letter will be updated annually or
                  upon change of parking wardens, whichever occurs first.
                  3. Primary parking wardens will receive training from 75 SFS/S5L.
                  They will:
                     a. Control and verify the issuance of all DD Forms 1408,
                  (AFMAN 31-116, paragraph 4.4.3.). Control and log issuance of
                  parking forms, permits and decals prescribed by this GM.
                     b. Ensure parking requirements for their parking lots are strictly
                  enforced. Except: parking wardens should contact Security Forces
                  upon learning of any vehicle suspected of being illegally parked in
                  designated handicap parking space for appropriate action (check for
                  display of handicap decal, placard, sign, etc., as described in
                  paragraph 3.4.5).
                     c. Issue DD Forms 1408 for parking violations in their assigned
                  parking lots, submit the white and yellow copies 75 SFS/S5L within
                  three duty days after issuance, and keep track of the number and
                  location of DD Form 1408 books issued. Non-primary parking
                  wardens may be delegated authority to issue DD Forms 1408 in their
                  assigned parking lots, and when relieved of these duties, they will
                  relinquish all unused books to the primary parking warden.
                     d. Issue parking decals and placards only to vehicles allowed to
                  park in the respective lot. Each requester will only be issued one
                  decal or placard per vehicle, but each decal or placard will only be for
                  one parking space.
                     e. Ensure decals and placards are removed and returned upon an
                  individual’s PCS, retirement, etc.
                     f. Submit an annual report to the 75 SFS/S5L of all assigned
                parking slots, including a list of all reserved parking slots, parking
                passes or decals issued, and official parking permits.
                   g. Train alternate parking wardens and provide them continuing
                guidance.
Parking Rules   1. All personnel driving POVs to their workplace will park in their
                organization’s parking lot.
                2. Only state issued handicapped placard, DD Form 787, Handicap
                Person Vehicle Decal or locally generated temporary medical placard
                authorizes handicapped parking on base. The only exception to this
                is parking in reserved lots. If not assigned the reserved lot parking is
                not authorized, unless temporarily visiting. To be issued a temporary
                or permanent base handicapped parking permit, an individual must
                bring a properly accomplished HILLAFB Form 339, Handicap
                Parking Request (blocks 1-21 by requester and blocks 23-28 by
                applicable civilian or base hospital), to 75 SFS/S5L. This form needs
                to be signed by a medical physician as proof of the need for the
                permit. Temporary permits need the duration of the needed permit.
                Since the permits are accountable, the information (name, work
                center, organization, duty phone and effective dates) is kept in a log
                with 75 SFS/S5L. When the temporary permit expires it will be
                returned to 75 SFS/S5L for destruction.
                3. Vehicles will be parked only in areas specifically designated,
                posted or striped as parking areas, zones, lots or spaces.
                Exception: Parallel parking is authorized on streets in base housing.
                4. Parking lot decals will be placed on the driver’s side rear bumper
                of vehicles. Placards or hanging permits will be placed so they are
                visible through the vehicle windshield.
                5. Maintenance and service vehicles, or POVs on official business,
                may stop at building entrances to load or unload cargo or equipment,
                providing other vehicular traffic is not obstructed and traffic hazards
                are not created.
                6. All boats and trailers not parked in carports or garages in base
                housing will be stored in the fenced compound near Bldg 1138 or off
                base. The motor pool dispatcher controls access to the compound.
                7. Official business parking is authorized in accordance with
                paragraph 4.8.3. and Table 4.1. of this GM.
                8. Except as otherwise provided in this GM, vehicles stopping or
                parking on two-way roadways will do so with both passenger-side
                wheels within 12 inches of the right curb or paved edge of the
                roadway.
                9. Non-emergency vehicles will not back into diagonal parking
                spaces.
                10. Vehicles in parking spaces shall not obstruct walkways.
                11. Carpool spaces will be used for employee carpools Monday-
                Friday, 0530-1600. At all other times, these spaces will be available
                for open parking.
                12. All base parking lots requiring numbered parking or carpool
                     decals will be available for open parking outside of Monday-Friday,
                     0530-1600.
                     13. Parking Lot 17, on the northeast side of Bldg 100, will only be
                     for handicap parking.
                     14. Only motorcycles will park in designated motorcycle parking
                     spaces, with no exceptions for inclement weather.
                     15. Parking is prohibited in the following areas:
                          a. In or along any areas not designated, posted or striped for
                     parking, including along yellow or red painted curbs.
                          b. In reserved spaces.
                          c. In bus stop zones, except for carpool drop-offs and pickups.
                          d. Within 30 feet of stop signs or traffic signals.
                          e. Within 10 feet of permanent buildings or within 20 feet of
                     temporary buildings, unless the area is specifically designated for
                     parking or loading/unloading is taking place.
                          f. Within 15 feet of a fire hydrant, in any direction.
                          g. Outside the white lines of parking spaces. Vehicles will not

                          h. Anywhere on base roadways when the purpose is major or
                     minor repairs. Major repairs will also not be made in base parking
                     lots. Major repairs include: repairing the engine, drive train, or rear
                     end; replacing body parts; placing the vehicle on jack stands or drive-
                     on ramps (excluding tire changing), or any repair disabling the
                     vehicle for six hours or longer.
                     1. Personnel authorized to permanently register POVs may display
75th Force Support
                     them for sale in the parking lot adjacent to Bldg 805, Outdoor
Squadron (75 FSS)
                     Recreation (75 FSS/FSCO). Before such use, personnel will register
For Sale Lot
                     their POVs and obtain a permit from the base Auto Hobby Shop (75
                     FSS/FSCT), 777-3476. All POVs parked in the For Sale Lot will
                     have a current state registration and vehicle liability insurance.
                     2. POVs may also be displayed for sale at base housing residences if
                     parked in their driveways or garages.
Recreational         1. RVs (motor homes, fifth wheels, travel trailers, pickup truck
Vehicle (RV)         campers, and pop-up/tent campers) post unique problems for the
Parking/Use          installation. Their size, either alone or in conjunction with their tow
                     vehicle, imposes challenges and obstacles to traffic, often requiring
                     more than the single parking space allotted for POVs.
                     2. The following rules govern the parking and use of RVs on base.
                         a. RVs may be stored or parked only in the following locations: 1
                     Apr–31 Oct, in the designated RV storage lot, or completely within
                     the driveway or carport of a base housing unit; 1 Nov-31 Mar, in the
                     RV storage lot, or off base. Except for trucks with campers mounted
                     in their beds, RVs will not be parked on the street in base housing.
                     RVs will not be stored in parking lots.
                         b. RVs will not be occupied overnight unless registered and
                     parked in the Family Camping Area (FAMCAMP). On occasion, the
                     75th FSS may sponsor an activity and designate a parking lot for the
                           use of RVs participating in that activity, and RVs parked in the
                           designated area may only dry camp; there will be no connection to
                           utilities (electricity, water and sewer). Generator use will be
                           determined for each event (normally 0600-2200 hours). Quiet hours
                           will be from 2200-0600.
                               c. Transient RVs may park at the base exchange and commissary
                           for a reasonable length of time while their occupants are shopping in
                           these facilities, but in no case will they remain overnight. Drivers
                           will do everything possible to avoid causing obstruction to other
                           traffic.
                               d. Small RVs (typically pickup truck campers and small Class B
                           motor homes) may be used by personnel to commute to and from
                           work, only as long as the vehicles, when parked, occupy no more
                           than a single parking space.
                               e. 75 SFS/S3O personnel or parking wardens may ticket violators.
                           Unattended RVs in violation may be ticketed and towed at the
                           owner’s expense. Repeated violations may result in denial of entry to
                           base. Under some circumstances, owners/drivers may be debarred
                           from base.
