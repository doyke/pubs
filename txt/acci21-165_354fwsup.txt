SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This Supplement establishes policy and assigns responsibility for 354th Fighter Wing, 354th
Operations Group, and 354th Maintenance Group commanders to develop, execute and evaluate
aircraft flying and maintenance programs. This publication applies to all mission design series
assigned to the 354th Fighter Wing. Forward comments and suggested improvements to this
instruction using an AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, coordinated
through appropriate channels to 354 MXG/MXOO, Building 1347, 551 Loop Access, Eielson
Air Force Base, Alaska 99702. This publication does not apply to the US Air Force Reserve or
Air National Guard units or members.
2.8. Standardization . The following guidelines have been established to standardize scheduling
practices in the 354 FW.
2.8.1. (Added) The flying squadron flying window is defined as the first local flying squadron
take-off to the last local flying squadron landing to include cross country departure/return. The
wing will adhere to a 10-hour maximum flying squadron flying window, unless otherwise
approved by the 354 MXG/CC and 354 OG/CC.
2.8.2. (Added) Cross-Country (XC) Procedures. Typical weekend XC will be incorporated as
follows.
2.8.2.1. (Added) Schedule all XC missions departing from Eielson AFB on the daily flying page
with take-off and estimated land times printed. XC missions originating from off station
(returning to Eielson AFB) will be listed with a XC line number for the returning sortie along
with an estimated take off/land time (if available or TBD if times are unknown) on the daily
flying page. Aircraft designated as air spares to support cross-country deployments will use
cross country line numbers. NOTE: Any changes to off station XC sorties will not be recorded
as a deviation for FSE.
2.8.3. (Added) Requests for fly-bys, static displays, air shows, and local quiet hours will be
coordinated through 354 OSS/OSCR. Additionally, 354 OSS/OSCR will be the focal point for
coordination with visiting units not associated with RED FLAG-Alaska exercises.
2.8.3.1. (Added) All notifications of fly-bys, static displays, air shows, and local quiet hours
requests will be made to 354 OSS/OSCR by 354 FW Public Affairs, via DD Form 2535 (Request
for Military Aerial Support). All local requests for wing assets to be static displays will be
coordinated using a Static Display Request letter.
2.8.3.2. (Added) 354 OSS/OSCR will forward dates, location, desired aircraft configuration and
recommended tasking to respective squadron commanders and the OG/CC.
2.8.3.3. (Added) Squadron commanders will notify OG/CC of their ability to support the
request. The OG/CC will notify 354 OSS/OSCR of approval or disapproval. Status of all static
display and fly-by requests will be discussed and approved/disapproved at the scheduled
OG/MXG scheduling meeting.
2.8.3.4. (Added) 354 OSS/OSCR will be responsible for handling and coordinating the approval
package with Major Command (MAJCOM) and non-appropriated funds (NAF) when required
for additional approval.

3.8.2.5. (Added) When coordinating an AF Form 2407, Weekly/Daily Flying Schedule
Coordination, change, ensure agencies whose approval are required actually receive and approve
the requested action. Affected agencies can provide approval either electronically, verbally, or
by physically signing the form. For electronic or verbal approval, record the name, time, and
date of approval. All affected agencies must sign 2407 for changes to be valid. If scheduled
maintenance events will be affected (that is, cancelled or delayed) list each action on the AF
Form 2407 that will not be complied with as previously scheduled. NOTE: All agencies
affected by the change will be listed as a notification agency on the AF Form 2407 (coordination
is mandatory). Use of the AF Form 2407 does not negate the recording of IMDS events and/or
FSE/MSE deviations (non-spared cancels or ground aborts, early/late takeoffs, early/late
