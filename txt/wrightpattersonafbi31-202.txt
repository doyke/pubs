This instruction outlines procedures which govern the Juvenile Services/Dependent Misconduct Program

MEMORANDUM FOR PARENTS AND GUARDIANS


FROM: 88 SFS/JSO


SUBJECT: Welcome Letter to Parents and Guardians




1. Welcome to Wright-Patterson AFB. Everyone at the 88th Security Forces Squadron hopes you and
your family have an enjoyable and safe tour. The 88th Air Base Wing and local communities have many
events and facilities for you and your family to enjoy and the people here are always striving to provide
safe and enjoyable activities for all of our members and families. As the agency most responsible for the
safety and security of you and your family, we are asking for your support to help us keep Wright-Patter-
son and our residents safe. In order to do this, we have implemented a program, which we believe will
ensure the protection of you, your family, and your possessions. One of the prongs of our community
policing approach is the juvenile supervision program. There are special rules on base for juveniles listed
below of which I would like to make you aware. Please feel free to contact the 88th Security Forces
Squadron, Security Forces Control Center at 257-6517 if you have any questions on these policies.


2. There is a curfew for all children under the age of 18. Curfew is from 0001-0600 hours which is
strictly enforced and apply unless children are accompanied by an adult(s).


3. Some areas of the base are not appropriate for unsupervised children and should be avoided. Children
are specifically not permitted in the following areas unsupervised:
       a. Bar areas of Golf Clubs, Flywright Club or Wright-Patterson Club and Banquet center.
       b. The BX and commissary complexes and parking areas after operational hours.
       c. All dormitories and other bachelor quarters except when accompanied by a parent or guardian.
       d. Controlled and restricted areas.


4. Parents are responsible to ensure the good behavior of their children. Wright-Patterson AFB Instruc-
tion 31-202, Juvenile Services/Dependent Misconduct Program, details the procedure for disciplining
children who disrupt the good order and discipline on base. The command authority at Wright-Patterson
AFB takes juvenile mischief very seriously and will act swiftly to correct offenders.

please contact the Juvenile Services Officer at 257-0230.

Dear Mr./Ms. Juvenile,


1. On behalf of the 88th Air Base Wing Juvenile Misconduct Hearing (JMH) members, I congratulate you
for successfully completing the Wright-Patterson AFB Juvenile Misconduct Program. Although you
made a mistake, it is my sincere hope this program was helpful in showing you are responsible for your
actions and there are consequences for the decisions that you make. Our goal is for you to remember this
lesson so if you are tempted in the future, you will make the right decision.


2. Everyone makes mistakes. What separates those who will be successful in life from those who will
not, is admitting a mistake and taking action to apologize and rectify the situation. By completing the
Juvenile Misconduct Program, you have shown your desire to move forward in a positive direction. On
behalf of all the board members, I wish you all the best.


Sincerely,
