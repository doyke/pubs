Medical Group (6 MDG). Maintain and dispose of records created as a result of prescribed processes
according to the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule, accessible on-line at https://
afrims.amc.af.mil/. This instruction requires the collection and (or) maintenance of information pro-
tected by the Privacy Act of 1974. The authorities to collect and (or) maintain the records prescribed in
this instruction are 5 USC Chapter 552a, The Privacy Act of 1974, and 10 USC 8013, Secretary of the Air

1. General.
   1.1. Rabies is an acute infectious viral disease of the central nervous system to which all
   warm-blooded mammals, including man, are susceptible. The infection in man is almost always fatal
   if not prophylactically treated in an expedient manner. Man becomes infected by exposure to the
   infected saliva or, in the case of bats, either a bite or aerosolized feces of an infected animal.
   1.2. Captocytophagia Caninmorsis (formerly known as Dysgonic Fermenter 2/DF-2) infection is
   caused by a pathogenic organism that has been isolated from the saliva of dogs and cats. First reported
   in 1976, the organism has been most frequently associated with dog bites, and has resulted in local
   skin infection, meningitis, heart disease, and death. Persons who are without spleens, have diabetes,
   leukemia, lupus, sickle cell anemia, an immune deficiency, or are alcoholics appear particularly sus-
   ceptible to complications from Captocytophagia Caninmorsis. The organism is highly sensitive to
   antibiotics; penicillin, erythromycin, or tetracycline should be used as prophylaxis.

    1.3. All animal bites, scratches, or possible exposure to rabies should be reported to the nearest emer-
    gency room. If a patient reports to the 6 MDG, they will be referred to the Flight Surgeon’s Office
    (FSO) for evaluation and treatment.
    1.4. The Rabies Advisory Committee (RAC) meeting is a formal meeting that occurs quarterly during
    the month following the end of each quarter (January, April, July, October). The voting members of
    the RAC consist of:
       1.4.1. Chairperson (Flight Medicine Flight Commander or their designee).
       1.4.2. Pediatric physician (for applicable cases).
       1.4.3. Public Health Officer (PHO).
       1.4.4. Base Veterinarian.
       1.4.5. A representative from the 6th Security Forces Squadron (6 SFS) and Base Housing office
       are also invited to attend each RAC, but are not voting members.
    1.5. A Rabies Advisory Board (RAB) is conducted telephonically (informally) to consider rabies pro-
    phylactic treatment in specific cases. A RAB is initiated by the attending provider or on-duty staff
    physician, as appropriate, who suspects that the risk of rabies exposure is greater than minimal. A
    RAB must consist of the following voting members:
       1.5.1. Attending Flight Surgeon or on-duty staff physician.
       1.5.2. On-call Flight Surgeon or Flight Medicine Flight Commander.
       1.5.3. On-call Pediatrician for pediatric patients.
       1.5.4. In the event of a voting “tie” or when other members cannot be reached for consultation, at
       least one other credentialed provider must be consulted.
       1.5.5. Outcome of a RAB must be documented on the Department of Defense (DD) Form 2341,
       Report of Animal Bite – Potential Rabies Exposure, by the attending physician or his/her tech-
       nician.

2. Responsibilities.
    2.1. FSO:
       2.1.1. FSO evaluates and initiates treatment of all patients with potential rabies exposure (animal
       bites or scratches).
       2.1.2. FSO Technician and/or Nurse:
           2.1.2.1. Receives and registers the patient in accordance with FSO policies. The patient
           should be entered with a comment of “animal bite” or “animal scratch” in the Composite
           Health Care Systems (CHCS) Program. This entry should also be visible on the Joint Commis-
           sion on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) Control Register.
           2.1.2.2. Initiates the DD Form 2341. The DD Form 2341 is controlled; the forms are num-

must be documented in patient’s medical record.
          2.1.3.3. Questions the patient to determine risk of complications associated with Captocy-
          tophagia Caninmorsis (formerly known as Dysgonic Fermenter 2/DF-2) infection and the risk
