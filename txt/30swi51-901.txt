This instruction implements AFPD 51-9, Civil Law For Individuals and provides the framework
for the disposition of juvenile misconduct cases and the treatment of juveniles on Vandenberg
AFB, CA. The purpose of this instruction is to establish policies, responsibilities, and
procedures for the administrative disposition of misconduct committed by juveniles on
Vandenberg AFB and to establish the Vandenberg AFB Juvenile Assistance Council (JAC). The
JAC will hear cases in which a juvenile is alleged to have engaged in misconduct or any other
case referred to it by the 30 Space Wing (30 SW). Any actions taken by the JAC will be
designed to attain the primary goal of maintaining good order and discipline on Vandenberg
AFB and, if possible, rehabilitating the juvenile. Notwithstanding the existence of this
instruction, AFI 51-905, Use of Magistrate Judges for Trial of Misdemeanors Committed by
Civilians and the Federal Magistrate’s Court program will continue to apply to all offenses
committed on base by civilians. This publication is affected by the Privacy Act of 1974. Each
form that is subject to the provisions of AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Act Program, and is
required by this publication will contain a Privacy Act statement, either incorporated in the body
of the document or in a separate statement accompanying each document. Refer recommended
changes and questions about this instruction to 30 SW/JA, 747 Nebraska Ave., Suite C-100,
VAFB CA 93437, using AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publications. Ensure
that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with AFMAN 33-363 Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with
 2                                                                 30SWI51-901 27 APRIL 2010

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

No major concept changes have been made to this instruction. Minor changes have been made
throughout to clarify administrative matters, including an articulation that the JAC chairman may
issue a warning letter in his or her discretion rather than meeting with the juvenile or taking no
action. A sample warning letter has been added as Attachment 4.
1. Authority.
     1.1. Public Law 93-415, Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (18
     U.S.C. §§ 5031-5042), provides that misconduct committed by a juvenile in an area of
     Federal jurisdiction should be disposed of outside the Federal courts whenever feasible. This
     statute establishes an administrative system in lieu of prosecution of juveniles for
     misdemeanor non-traffic offenses in Federal Magistrate’s Court. Felony offenses committed
     by juveniles in violation of the United States Code will continue to be prosecuted in Federal
     Court.
     1.2. AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, provides that the installation commander is charged
     with protecting government property and personnel from hostile and criminal acts. To
     achieve this goal, the commander may require that any juvenile charged with misconduct
     appear before the JAC and explain why base privileges should not be limited or revoked.
     Privileges subject to revocation include the following: base exchange, base gas station,
     commissary, housing, theater, shoppette, base driving privileges, and the privilege of entering
     any part (or all) of the base. This instruction complies with the foregoing law and instruction
     by ensuring that an offense involving a juvenile is identified, adjudicated, and disposed of in
     a manner that maintains good order and discipline while stressing deterrence and
     rehabilitation of the juvenile.
2. Purpose of the JAC.
     2.1. The JAC is designed to:
        2.1.1. Maintain good order, morale and discipline on Vandenberg AFB.
        2.1.2. Educate juveniles and their sponsors on the consequences of misconduct and crime
        (i.e., the impact crime has on the juvenile, the juvenile’s family, the victim(s), and the
        community).
        2.1.3. Rehabilitate juveniles through counseling, education, community service,
        restitution, and other means of corrective action as recommended by the JAC and ordered
        by 30 SW/CC.
        2.1.4. Protect the best interests of both the juvenile and the Vandenberg AFB
        community. Accordingly, the system avoids labeling the juveniles with the stigma of
        “criminal” or “delinquent.” Rather, simply the term “juvenile” is used in this instruction.
30SWI51-901 27 APRIL 2010                                                                        3


3. Individuals Subject to the Program.
   3.1. This instruction applies to all juveniles who have engaged in misconduct on Vandenberg
   AFB, including:
      3.1.1. Juvenile dependents of personnel stationed at Vandenberg AFB (to include all
      tenant units).
      3.1.2. Juvenile dependents of active duty or retired military personnel using Vandenberg
      AFB facilities.
      3.1.3. Juvenile dependents of DoD civilians or contractors.
      3.1.4. Non-base affiliated juveniles who are attending school on Vandenberg AFB.
      3.1.5. Any juvenile on Vandenberg AFB for any reason.
   3.2. This instruction also applies to the sponsors of juveniles who engage in misconduct on
   Vandenberg AFB.
4. Scope of the JAC.
   4.1. The JAC will adjudicate cases involving non-traffic offenses such as simple/non-
   aggravated assault, battery, shoplifting, trespassing, or other types of cases at the discretion
   of the 30 MSG/CC.
   4.2. The JAC will not adjudicate traffic offenses. 30 SFS will continue to issue a United
   States District Court Violation Notice to juveniles who commit minor traffic offenses. These
   offenses will continue to be processed through the Central Violations Bureau (CVB) and the
   Federal Magistrate Court.
   4.3. Certain rehabilitative measures, such as referral to counseling, performance of
   community service, or participation in a work program by the juvenile may only be imposed
   by the JAC if the juvenile agrees to submit to the JAC’s jurisdiction. Participation by the
   juvenile in the JAC program is voluntary. However, certain administrative sanctions may be
   taken immediately upon commission of an offense against a juvenile even if the juvenile
   refuses to submit to the jurisdiction of the JAC. For example, 30 SW/CC retains the
   authority, under AFI 31-101, to bar the juvenile from base or terminate base housing
   privileges for the juvenile’s family. Rescission of administrative sanctions (e.g.,
   reinstatement of privileges) may be contingent upon the juvenile’s consent to the jurisdiction
   of the JAC and satisfactory completion by the juvenile and/or his or her sponsor of
   rehabilitative measures ordered by the JAC.
   4.4. If a juvenile refuses to submit to the jurisdiction of the JAC, the juvenile’s case will be
   referred to the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate (30 SW/JA) to determine whether to
   forward the case through appropriate state or federal channels for disposition.
5. Composition of the JAC.
   5.1. The Deputy Commander, 30th Mission Support Group (30 MSG/CD), shall serve as the
   JAC Chairman.
   5.2. The Chairman may select other members of the base community to sit on the JAC if the
   nature of a particular case so requires. The other members may include, but are not limited
   to, the following organizations:
 4                                                                 30SWI51-901 27 APRIL 2010


        5.2.1. Chaplain (30 SW/HC).
        5.2.2. 30th Security Forces Squadron (30 SFS).
        5.2.3. Family Advocacy (30 MDOS/SGOH).
        5.2.4. Family Member Programs Flight (30 MSG/SVY).
     5.3. Special invited guests, such as a representative from the Family Support Center (30
     MSS/DPF) or the Base Housing Management Office (30 CES/CEH), may also attend as
     appropriate. Guests may also include the sponsor’s commander and first sergeant.
     5.4. An attorney from 30 SW/JA will be available to advise the Chairman on legal issues.
     The attorney may also sit as a member of the JAC.
6. Responsibilities.
     6.1. Security Forces (30 SFS) will:
        6.1.1. Prepare AF Form 3545, Incident/Complaint Report, accurately describing the
        alleged misconduct for all non-traffic related offenses.
        6.1.2. Contact the juvenile and sponsor with the date, time, and location of the meeting
        with the JAC Chairman. The meeting date shall be as soon as possible, but no later than
        90 days after discovery of a juvenile’s alleged involvement in a particular incident or 90
        days after the completion of an investigation into an incident of juvenile misconduct,
        whichever is later.
        6.1.3. Issue a notification memorandum (see Attachment 2) signed by 30 MSG/CD to
        the juvenile and the juvenile’s parent(s)/sponsor(s) informing them of the charge (an
        information copy will be sent to the sponsor’s unit commander).
        6.1.4. If applicable, issue to the juvenile a memorandum signed by 30 MSG/CC that
        immediately suspends the juvenile’s on-base privileges relating to the offense and serve a
        copy on the juvenile and the juvenile’s parent(s)/sponsor(s).
        6.1.5. Send the DD Form 3545 and a copy of the notification letter to 30 SW/JA and 30
        MSG/CD.
        6.1.6. If any of the juvenile’s privileges are to be revoked, 30 SFS/S5SR will prepare a
        revocation memorandum for 30 MSG/CC’s signature, addressed to the sponsor, directing
        the sponsor to apply for a replacement identification card for the juvenile with limited
        privileges. Once signed and returned, 30 SFS/S5SR will ensure the signed memorandum
        is mailed or given in hand to the juvenile and his or her parent(s)/sponsor(s) and a copy is
        forwarded to 30 MSS/DPMPS.
     6.2. The 30 MSG/CC will determine if the matter is appropriate for JAC disposition and,
     based on the facts of each case, whether other members of the JAC need to be present at the
     hearing. When practicable, 30 MSG/CC should consult with the JAC legal advisor in
     making these determinations.
     6.3. The 30 MSG/CD will:
        6.3.1. In cases where 30 MSG/CC finds it unnecessary to convene the JAC, send, when
        determined appropriate by 30 MSG/CC and 30 MSG/CD, a notice to the juvenile and his
30SWI51-901 27 APRIL 2010                                                                         5


     or her parent(s)/sponsor(s) explaining that future misconduct may result in an appearance
     before the JAC (see Attachment 4).
     6.3.2. Prepare a decision memorandum (see Attachment 3), addressed to the juvenile,
     announcing the final disposition of the case. The memorandum shall also include
     information regarding community service, counseling referrals, etc., as applicable.
     Ensure the signed memorandum is given to the juvenile and his or her sponsor(s) and that
     a copy is forwarded to 30 SFS/S5SR and 30MSS/DPMPS.
  6.4. The JAC will:
     6.4.1. Meet as directed by the JAC Chairman to review cases of juvenile misconduct.
     6.4.2. Determine whether an act of misconduct was committed by a juvenile by utilizing
     a preponderance of the evidence standard. This is the standard of proof necessary to find
     that the juvenile committed the misconduct in question. This standard is met when the
     credible evidence as a whole shows that it is more probable than not that the juvenile
     engaged in misconduct.
     6.4.3. Recommend an appropriate response to the misconduct, including but not limited
     to the following or any combination thereof:
         6.4.3.1. No action.
         6.4.3.2. Oral counseling, admonition, or reprimand of the juvenile and/or his or her
         sponsor.
         6.4.3.3. Written counseling, admonition, or reprimand of the juvenile and/or his or
         her sponsor signed by 30 MSG/CD.
         6.4.3.4. Referral of the juvenile and/or sponsor(s) to Family Advocacy, Mental
         Health, or other agency for counseling.
         6.4.3.5. Placement of certain base areas and/or facilities off-limits to the juvenile.
         6.4.3.6. Imposition of a curfew other than the normal base curfew.
         6.4.3.7. Restriction of access to base functions.
         6.4.3.8. Suspension or revocation of any or all base privileges.
         6.4.3.9. Recommendation of barment from Vandenberg AFB to 30 SW/CC.
         6.4.3.10. Recommendation of termination of on-base family housing to 30 SW/CC.
         6.4.3.11. Requirement that the juvenile complete a specified number of hours of
         community service on or off Vandenberg AFB.
         6.4.3.12. Recommendation of corrective action to other base agencies.
         6.4.3.13. Referral to 30 SW/JA to determine whether to forward the case to a civilian
         tribunal for disposition. This will likely be the outcome when, during the JAC
         proceedings, additional information becomes known which casts the alleged
         offense(s) in a much more serious light than previously believed.
 6                                                                  30SWI51-901 27 APRIL 2010


            6.4.3.14. Any other action deemed appropriate for the preservation of good order,
            morale and discipline on Vandenberg AFB after consultation with an attorney from
            30 SW/JA.
        6.4.4. The JAC may require the juvenile and sponsor to attend a future JAC meeting to
        determine whether the action taken was correct and sufficient and whether the juvenile is
        complying with the terms and conditions.
     6.5. The juvenile and his or her sponsor will:
        6.5.1. Notify 30 MSG/CD and 30 SW/JA if they will submit to the jurisdiction of the
        JAC.
        6.5.2. Appear before the JAC as directed in the notification memorandum.
        6.5.3. Be afforded at the JAC hearing an opportunity to provide information relevant to
        the case by means of personal testimony, witnesses, documents, and other evidence and
        have these matters heard.
        6.5.4. Upon submission to the jurisdiction of the JAC, comply with all orders of the JAC
        and the decision memorandum issued by 30 MSG/CD. While participation in community
        service and counseling programs by the juvenile and/or the sponsor is voluntary,
        rescission of administrative sanctions (e.g., reinstatement of privileges) may be
        contingent upon the satisfactory completion of such programs.
     6.6. An attorney from 30 SW/JA will:
        6.6.1. Be available to the Chairman to advise on legal issues as needed.
        6.6.2. Bring to the JAC’s attention and resolve any issues of law that arise before, during
        and after the JAC proceedings.
7. Conducting JAC meetings.
     7.1. The JAC Chairman shall conduct JAC meetings.
     7.2. The JAC may arrange for the appearance of any witness deemed necessary for the
     resolution of the case. Formal rules of evidence do not apply. The JAC may consider
     information, within its discretion, that is deemed reliable.
     7.3. JAC meetings shall be closed to the public, as the information discussed is protected
     from public disclosure by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. §552a.
     7.4. Members of the JAC attending the hearing may make relevant inquiries of the juvenile,
     his or her sponsor, or any witness.
     7.5. JAC meetings are not adversarial proceedings. Neither the juvenile nor his or her
     sponsor has the right to free assistance of legal counsel during the meeting. Nothing in this
     instruction shall be construed to grant any additional legal rights to the juvenile or his or her
     sponsor.

Terms
Jurisdiction—The JAC shall have jurisdiction over minor juvenile misconduct that occurs on
Vandenberg AFB. Major misconduct, including Class A misdemeanors and felonies, will be
referred to 30 SW/JA to determine whether to forward to state or federal tribunals for
disposition.
Juvenile—An unemancipated minor. A person is unemancipated if he or she is not 18 years of
age, is unmarried, is not in military active duty status, is not living separate and apart from his or
her parents or guardian, and has not been deemed emancipated by a court of competent
jurisdiction. A minor is any person under the age of 18 years.
Juvenile Assistance Council—The council charged with reviewing cases of minor juvenile
misconduct.
Misconduct—A violation of a federal, state, or local statute; a breach of Air Force or installation
instructions or regulations; or conduct disruptive to good order, morale, or discipline on
Vandenberg AFB. Examples include, but are not limited to, any of the following: (1) Pattern of
disobedience of the lawful rules set forth by Security Forces or recreation supervisors, etc. (2)
disrespect to military or civil service personnel, or physical assault or battery upon any of these
persons. (3) Loitering about the streets, parking lots, or buildings of Vandenberg AFB during the
hours of darkness in violation of curfew regulation. (4) Vandalism or destructive behavior
causing damages to property. (5) Shoplifting from a commissary, Base Exchange, or other
AAFES institution.
Preponderance of the Evidence—The standard of proof necessary to find that a juvenile
committed the misconduct in question. This standard is met when the credible evidence as a
whole shows that it is more probable than not that the fact sought to be proved (i.e., that the
juvenile committed the act) actually occurred.
Sponsor—An adult who is the parent or guardian of a juvenile alleged to have committed
misconduct on Vandenberg AFB. A sponsor includes the host of a guest from off base or who
has responsibility for the conduct of juveniles in his or her charge.
