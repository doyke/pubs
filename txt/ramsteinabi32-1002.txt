2. Snow and Ice Control Concept of Operations.
   2.1. Airfield Pavements.
      2.1.1. During and after snow and ice events, Ramstein Air Base must conduct snow and
      ice control operations around-the-clock to ensure that airfield pavements are properly
      cleared in order to support both 86th Airlift Wing and 721st Air Mobility Operations
      Group missions. The entire Ramstein Air Base community must be engaged in this effort
      in order to prevent lost sorties. This section describes specific actions that individuals
      and organizations must conduct/implement during snow and ice control operations.
      2.1.2. The Airfield Management Flight, 86th Operations Support Squadron (86
      OSS/OSAM) is the single point of contact for airfield pavement snow and ice control
      priorities. Airfield Management is the only agency authorized to give direction to the
      KMC Snow Control Center; 86 AW/CC can alter the priorities to 86 OSS/OSAM at any
      time.
          2.1.2.1. All base agencies and tenants shall communicate their airfield pavement
          clearing requirements to 86 OSS/OSAM for incorporation into one single integrated
          priority listing.   The single integrated priority list includes all operational
          requirements of the airfield from the 86 AW and the 721 AMOG. This is a master list
          that is updated periodically through the snow event to ensure proper communication
          with the maintenance production superintendent and the snow removal shop.
          2.1.2.2. The 86 OSS/OSAM shall communicate the airfield pavement clearing
          priorities to the KMC Snow Control Center for accomplishment.
          2.1.2.3. 86 OSS/OSAM will forward any changes in the single integrated priority list
          or special clearing requests to the KMC Snow Control Center via SharePoint (if
10                                                RAMSTEINABI32-1002 28 APRIL 2011


        available), email, and telephone; multiple methods of communication will ensure
        positive confirmation that the KMC Snow Control Center has received the updated
        priority list.
        2.1.2.4. The KMC Snow Control Center shall notify the Ramstein Snow Removal
        Team Chief of the updated priority list. The Ramstein Snow Removal Team Chief
        will direct snow and ice control crews to clear airfield pavements in accordance with
        the integrated priority list.
        2.1.2.5. Prior to clearing an aircraft parking spot, the Ramstein Snow Removal Team
        Chief will meet with the requesting Production Superintendent to confirm the
        required work before snow and ice control operations begin. This meeting will be
        coordinated between the KMC Snow Control Center and the respective MOC.
        2.1.2.6. Upon clearing of airfield pavements, 86 AMXS Production Superintendent,
        721 AMXS Production Superintendent, and/or 86 OSS Airfield Management will
        inspect the area to determine if acceptable; the approval/disapproval will be provided
        to the KMC Snow Control Center. In addition, runway condition readings, if taken,
        will be reported to the KMC Snow Control Center.
        2.1.2.7. The 86 MOS/MOC and the 721 AMXS/MOC will notify 86 OSS/OSAM if
        an area is unacceptable based on the integrated priority list. 86 OSS/OSAM will
        evaluate the unacceptable areas and, if required, adjust the single integrated priority
        list accordingly. 86 OSS/OSAM will advise the KMC Snow Control Center of areas
        that need additional effort when the single integrated priority list is updated.
        2.1.2.8. 86 OSS/OSAM will keep the KMC Snow Control Center advised of
        pavement acceptance and any requirement for additional snow and ice control.
     2.1.3. Direction of airfield pavement snow and ice control crews is the responsibility of
     the KMC Snow Control Center and the Ramstein Snow Removal Team Chief.
        2.1.3.1. Airfield pavement snow and ice control personnel take direction from the
        Ramstein Snow Removal Team Chief only and will not be diverted by anyone for any
        reason except to stop an unsafe action.
        2.1.3.2. While the airfield is active, the KMC Snow Control Center and the Ramstein
        Snow Removal Team Chief will maintain radio contact with the control tower while
        conducting snow and ice control operations inside the controlled movement area.
        2.1.3.3. Airfield pavement snow and ice control operations take priority over other
        users on a multiple-user radio net, unless otherwise directed by the control tower.
        2.1.3.4. The control tower will leave airfield lights on when requested by the
        Ramstein Snow Removal Team Chief during snow and ice control operations.
        2.1.3.5. The Ramstein Snow Removal Team Chief shall notify 86 OSS/OSAM and
        the control tower of any unusual conditions on airfield pavements caused by snow
        and ice control operations, including potential and known hazards (windrows, snow
        banks, slush, etc). This is critical when snow removal operations are interrupted for
        arriving and departing aircraft.
RAMSTEINABI32-1002 28 APRIL 2011                                                                  11


        2.1.3.6. The KMC Snow Control Center shall notify 86 OSS/OSAM after airfield
        surfaces are cleared.
     2.1.4. Airfield Pavement Prioritization.
        2.1.4.1. 86 MOS/MOC will determine 86 AW airfield pavement priorities and
        forward them to 86 OSS/OSAM. 721 AMXS/MOC will determine 721 AMXS
        airfield pavement priorities and forward them to 86 OSS/OSAM. 86 OSS/OSAM
        will integrate priorities and develop one single integrated priority list; this list shall be
        provided to the KMC Snow Control Center.
        2.1.4.2. Changes to the priority list will occur as mission requirements change.
        Production Superintendents must immediately notify their respective MOC when
        changes occur. Each MOC shall immediately notify 86 OSS/OSAM of prioritization
        changes to allow snow and ice control crews time to reallocate resources. At least 90
        minutes will be allocated to clear one single aircraft parking spot; priority changes
        within this timeframe may result in partially cleared parking spots.
        2.1.4.3. Airfield Pavement Clearing Prioritization Procedures.
            2.1.4.3.1. Snow removal priorities shall be based on takeoff or arrival times in
            accordance with daily and updated clearing priority lists developed by the 86
            MOS/MOC and 721 AMXS/MOC. In the event of conflicts, clearing priorities
            are established by 86 OSS/OSAM using the following mission priority listing:
                2.1.4.3.1.1. Emergencies.
                2.1.4.3.1.2. National Airborne Operations Center, Dragon Claw, and/or Close

     uncovered at all times. Equipment operator must exercise caution to protect lights from
     damage while performing snow and ice control operations.
     2.1.6. Airfield Pavement Clearing Distances.
        2.1.6.1. The active runway is cleared 75-feet from each side of the centerline at the
        start of each snow and ice event. Further clearing is conducted in coordination with
        86 OSS/OSAM.
        2.1.6.2. Aircraft parking spots shall be cleared to accommodate the width of the main
        landing gear, ~40 ft for wide body aircraft (C-5, C-17, KC-10, B-747, etc), ~20 ft for
RAMSTEINABI32-1002 28 APRIL 2011                                                              13


        narrow body aircraft (C-130, KC-135, B-737, etc). If the area cleared is not wide
        enough (including taxi lane access routes), 86 MOS/MOC and 721 AMXS/MOC
        shall notify 86 OSS/OSAM in accordance with Para 2.1.2.6 of this document.
     2.1.7. During a snow and ice event, entire ramps cannot be cleared; 86 MOS/MOC and
     721 AMXS/MOC shall prioritize parking spot clearing requirements for 86 OSS/OSAM
     to create one single integrated priority list. After the snow or ice event has stopped, ramp
     clearance activities can begin, but will be accomplished as directed by 86 OSS/OSAM.
     2.1.8. Air Traffic Control and Landing System equipment does not require priority
     plowing or deicing unless snow accumulation reaches18-inches or the glide slope signal
     is affected. If this occurs:
        2.1.8.1. 86 CS maintenance personnel will request snow and ice control through 86
        OSS/OSAM.
        2.1.8.2. Air Traffic Control and Landing System maintenance personnel shall
        supervise snow and ice control operations in these areas.
     2.1.9. Unusual requirements (aircraft towing, Close Watch, etc) requiring airfield snow
     and ice control must be coordinated with 86 OSS/OSAM for proper prioritization.
     2.1.10. During heavy snowfalls, snow piles taller than 24-inches on airfield pavements
     hinder safe aircraft operations and must be removed.
     2.1.11. Operating Techniques.
        2.1.11.1. Snow and ice control techniques require the use of large capacity rotary
        snow blowers, large brooms, and rollover plows operating at high speeds. All
        personnel driving on or around the airfield must be aware of this requirement and
        yield to snow and ice control equipment.
            2.1.11.1.1. Snow and ice control operations on runways and taxiways may
            exceed 15 miles per hour.
            2.1.11.1.2. Snow and ice control operations on aircraft parking ramps, including
            taxiways and taxi lanes on aircraft parking ramps, shall not exceed 15 miles per
            hour.
        2.1.11.2. Under heavy snowfall conditions, operations are concentrated on keeping
        the centerline portion of the runway open. Wind velocity and direction usually
        determines the clearing pattern to be followed. The clearing pattern is at the
        discretion of the operator.
        2.1.11.3. To avoid accidents during low visibility conditions, snow and ice control
        operators must maintain a safe distance between vehicles, especially while operating
        in a snow removal pattern. Equipment movement must be carefully timed and
        coordinated to ensure an orderly turn-around and a safe re-entry at the start of the
        return trip.
        2.1.11.4. Snow and ice control equipment will be inspected at least once per shift to
        identify breakage or loss of parts that could pose a foreign object damage hazard to
        aircraft.

         2.1.11.5. Immediately notify 86 VRS Vehicle Maintenance regarding any vehicle
         maintenance requirements. Vehicles may not always be required to be turned-in
         when notified about vehicle maintenance requirements.
     2.1.12. Chemical Deicer.
         2.1.12.1. Deicing chemicals are applied to airfield pavements at the discretion of the
         Ramstein Snow Removal Team Chief and are spread far enough across the pavement
         to allow safe travel for the largest aircraft utilizing the cleared area.
         2.1.12.2. The KMC Snow Control Center shall notify 86 OSS/OSAM when chemical
         deicer is applied to any airfield pavement.
         2.1.12.3. Deicing chemicals are not applied on airfield pavement which already
         satisfies the minimum runway condition reading for safe launch and recovery of
         aircraft.
  2.2. Roads and Parking Lots.
     2.2.1. Simultaneously to snow and ice control operations on the airfield, snow and ice
     control operations are performed in streets and parking lots on Ramstein Air Base and the
     geographically separated installations in accordance with the established priority listings.
     Additional requests or changes shall be coordinated through the 786th Civil Engineer
