                                            Chapter 1

                          OBJECTIVES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Program: Outdoor recreation (ODR) supports mission readiness through expertly managed
programs and facilities delivering family and individual well-being, unit cohesion, and fitness.
The five program objectives incorporated a customer progression model:
   1.1.1. Serve as a mission support and quality of life asset for commanders.
   1.1.2. Introduce the diversity, values, and benefits of outdoor recreation activities.
   1.1.3. Teach appropriate attitudes, behaviors, and skills for these activities.
   1.1.4. Organize and lead safe and satisfying outings, activities, and programs.
   1.1.5. Provide information, referrals, equipment, recreation areas, and facilities for
   individuals and groups interested in outdoor recreation.
1.2. Program Eligibility. See AFI 34-262, Services Programs and Use Eligibility. ODR
facilities and programs must be accessible and inclusive for customers with disabilities IAW
Section 504 of the U.S. Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and DOD Directive 1020.1,
Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Handicap in Programs and Activities Assisted or Conducted
by the DoD.
1.3. Essential Program Components. A comprehensive ODR program includes six basic
components. They include:
   1.3.1. Organized Activities. The ability of the program to achieve its mission is primarily
   linked to Air Force personnel and their families participating in offered ODR activities.
   ODR programs will offer the following four types of organized activities:
       1.3.1.1. Awareness, Interest, and Entertainment. These are designed to stimulate market
       demand and communicate the diversity of available ODR activities. Examples include
       films, speakers, travelogues, exhibitions, etc.
       1.3.1.2. Instructional. These are specifically designed to transfer knowledge or develop
       skills through demonstrations, videos, computer-based individual instruction, or group
       classes.
       1.3.1.3. Mainstream Outdoor Recreation. These include popular activities, such as
       camping, bicycling, skiing, swimming, and fishing, and form the foundation of the ODR
       program.
       1.3.1.4. Outdoor Adventure. These specialized activities (e.g., white water rafting, scuba
       diving, rappelling, and rock climbing) carry a higher “perceived risk,” (i.e., how
       dangerous someone unfamiliar with the appropriate techniques and safety practices
       would consider an activity.)
   1.3.2. Referral Systems. It is not possible to directly provide all possible programs and
   services “in-house.” The ODR program will establish a referral system that addresses the
   following four categories:
 6                                          AFI34-110_VANCEAFBSUP 1 NOVEMBER 2013


        1.3.2.1. Information. An area in the ODR facility will be established as a browsing area
        and stocked with how-to books, instructional and safety videos, and a variety of ODR
        magazines.
        1.3.2.2. Interest Groups. Refer customers to individuals, local groups, or national
        organizations sharing their interests. A bulletin board will be available for posting
        information on local club activities and individuals planning self-directed outings.
        1.3.2.3. Locations and Destinations. Customers, particularly ones new to the area, need
        help finding items of interest in the local area. ODRs will offer guidebooks, maps, and
        brochures.
        1.3.2.4. External Suppliers of Programs, Services, or Equipment. If ODRs do not offer a
        program or service, be prepared to provide the customer with information on who may.
        This includes mail order and internet-based equipment retailers.
     1.3.3. Equipment Support. Specialized items such as kayaks, climbing ropes, or rescue gear
     may be reserved for internal program use only. Generalized ODR items such as sleeping
     bags, tents, fishing boats, and coolers support both internal programs and self-directed
     customer use. Paragraph 3.15 provides detailed guidance on equipment loan and rental
     operations.
     1.3.4. Customer Services. Customer services such as ski tuning, bike repair, or lawnmower
     tune-ups fill customer needs and create a potential revenue source. Paragraph 3.6.1 provides
     additional guidance on customer services.
     1.3.5. Resale Operations. Resale operations must be designed to enhance the customer’s
     ODR experiences, complement the programs and equipment offered, and increase ODR
     participation. Paragraph 3.6.2 outlines different approaches to providing resale operations.
     1.3.6. Facilities and Recreation Areas. The exact mix of facilities and recreation areas
     should be based on market demand and existing local resources. There are three core
     facilities:
        1.3.6.1. Outdoor recreation and equipment center
        1.3.6.2. Aquatics facility/swimming pool
        1.3.6.3. On-base park(s) with playgrounds and picnic areas.
     1.3.7. For specific information on facility requirements and design criteria, consult United
     Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-740-03, Unified Facilities Criteria Documents for Outdoor
     Recreation, and UFC 4-750-07F, Unified Facilities Criteria Documents for Aquatic
     Facilities. ODR typically operates a variety of other facilities, including but not limited to:
     natural swimming areas and beaches; recreational trails; off-base recreation areas; skeet, trap,
     and archery ranges; paintball fields; recreational vehicle (FAMCAMPs) and tent camping
     areas; recreational lodging facilities; marinas; ski areas; horse stables, pastures, and
     equestrian facilities; recreational vehicle storage lots; challenge/rope courses; and artificial
     climbing walls.
1.4. Core Activities. Core activities provide mission support by fostering family and individual
well-being, unit and community cohesion, and physical fitness. They also ensure some
consistency in program opportunities across the Air Force. The Air Force ODR core activities
AFI34-110_VANCEAFBSUP 1 NOVEMBER 2013                                                            7


include camping, canoeing, bicycling, fishing, walking/hiking, snow skiing/boarding, picnicking,
squadron outings, swimming, and nature/wildlife appreciation. Support for these activities is to
be provided at every installation where it is geographically appropriate. If a suitable setting for
the activity is available nearby or within a couple hours drive, then the activity should be
supported.
1.4. (VANCEAFB) Vance Form 78, User Responsibilities for Picnic Pavilion #720, will be
used for an individual to sign for keys to the picnic pavilion and acknowledge
responsibilities.
1.5. Annual Program Standards. The ODR program will provide, at a minimum, the
following number of activities shown in Figure 1.1 Use the Outdoor Recreation Program
Planning Matrix in Attachment 3 when developing the annual program plan.

1.6. Outdoor Recreation Personnel. The key to high-quality, safe, and successful programs is
an enthusiastic, knowledgeable, well-trained, and motivated staff.
   1.6.1. When programs require overnight or distant travel, place staff on temporary duty
   (TDY) orders in accordance with (IAW) AFI 65-103, Temporary Duty Orders. When
   employees are in a TDY status and pay for their own meals and or lodging, they are entitled
   to per diem rates for those expenditures. See AFI 65-103 for details. Establish a local
   operating instruction (OI) covering duty schedules, TDY orders, and compensatory time
   policies. Additional OIs are developed and implemented for local programs and facilities
   IAW AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.
   1.6.2. Program personnel must maintain certification in standard first aid and child and adult
   cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Exceptions to the certification requirements for
   administrative personnel should be coordinated with the installation safety office. Advanced
   first aid training for trip leaders and remote off-base recreation area personnel is strongly
   encouraged. Staff overseeing the aquatics program should complete the Aquatics Facility
   Operator certification program provided by the National Recreation and Park Association.
   1.6.3. Activity-specific training/certification standards (Attachment 2) apply to the activity
   leader(s) or, in the case of programs like whitewater rafting, all key program staff including
   volunteers. The manager must maintain a working knowledge of current industry practices
   as they apply to specific activities. This is best accomplished through an active professional
 8                                          AFI34-110_VANCEAFBSUP 1 NOVEMBER 2013


     development program including training, education, reading, and practical experience and
     attendance at national conferences relating to ODR programs, facilities, and management
     practices.
     1.6.4. Provide staff members and volunteers time to read all operating instructions (OIs)
     relating to their jobs when they start work. Supervisors document employee’s AF Form 55,
     Employee Safety and Health Record, authorized versions, or an equivalent computer
     generated product that is a true, reproducible, and historically accurate facsimile. Document
     dates of initial and, as required, refresher training.
     1.6.5. All staff will be identified as ODR personnel by wearing the Air Force approved
     outdoor recreation logo. The logo can be displayed as a patch, pin, nametag, embroidered or
     screen print on clothing, or as a stencil or decal on helmets and life jackets. Copies of the
     outdoor recreation program logo artwork are available from AFSVA at
     https://mil.afsv.net/MKT/Logo_ODR.htm.
     1.6.6. Customer convenience drives facility and staff schedules. Recreation professionals
     must expect to work when customers have free time such as weekends, holidays, and school
     breaks. The outdoor recreation and equipment center will normally be open on weekends
     and after normal duty hours on weekdays. If the budget requires reduced hours, consider
     cutting midweek hours.

 10                                       AFI34-110_VANCEAFBSUP 1 NOVEMBER 2013


      1.7.5.10. Establishes professional contacts with local resource management agencies,
      commercial providers of ODR services, and appropriate ODR associations to keep with
      current industry trends and standards.
1.8. Roles and Relationships With Other Organizations.
   1.8.1. On-Base Clubs and Other Recreational Organizations. Clubs expand the range of
   activities, enhance opportunities for cooperative programming, and improve cross marketing.
   Recreational membership clubs are established under Force Support supervision and their
   assets are accounted for and controlled IAW AFI 34-121, Other Recreation Membership
   Clubs Programs. Recreational membership clubs are Category C activities and must be
   supported with NAFs. Recreational clubs (e.g., shooting, scuba, equestrian) must comply
   with the same operational requirements listed in this AFI along with guidance in AFI 34-121.
   The installation commander approves other organizations, such as the Boy and Girl Scouts,
   and they manage their own resources; see AFI 34-223, Private Organizations (PO) Program.
   Private Organizations are not supported by NAFs and must raise and be supported by their
   own funds.
   1.8.2. Governmental Agencies. Federal, State, and other governmental agencies often
   manage and control access to natural resource areas used by ODR programs. They include
   Coast Guard, National Park Service, Forest Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of
   Land Management, Army Corps of Engineers, state department of natural resources or parks
   and wildlife, area water management agencies, municipal recreation and parks departments,
   etc. Their personnel have expertise which can be used to develop cooperative programs.
   Consider organizing volunteer service projects, such as habitat improvement or trail
   construction, to assist these agencies.
   1.8.2.1. Professional Associations. Professional and industry associations are the best source
   for technical information on managing ODR activities. They provide training and
   certification for many outdoor activities. Local and state associations, like guides and
   outfitters, often play a significant role in establishing regional program practices and may
   also influence natural resource access.
AFI34-110_VANCEAFBSUP 1 NOVEMBER 2013                                                          11


                                           Chapter 2

                     PROGRAM PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT.

2.1. Program development must begin with a good foundation of market intelligence
coupled with an assessment of existing resources. Assess market needs and interests through
surveys, interviews, focus groups, comment cards, past participation data and trends, industry
publications, and discussions with other ODR managers. The Force Support marketing specialist
and AFSVA Marketing can provide assistance with Air Force data and other market assessment
techniques.
2.2. A base’s ODR program is shaped by climate, geography, and available natural
resources. The manager must compile an inventory of local natural resources and local ODR
providers to identify the “raw materials” available for program planning. Begin by identifying
parks, rivers, lakes, mountains, ski areas, natural and wilderness areas, campgrounds, beaches,
trails, caves, or other places suitable for ODR. Then identify clubs, public agencies, schools, or
businesses providing ODR programs, services, or equipment. Use these inventories to identify
potential program ideas, outing locations, and provide referral information to customers.
2.3. To support the program's vision and a strong referral system, develop an office
resource collection of books, periodicals, maps, catalogs, etc. These materials can be used for
program planning, scouting trips, staff training, instructional classes, and by customers. They
should also focus on local natural resources, e.g., local and regional guidebooks. Be sure current
information regarding your on and off-base recreation areas is available. Work with your base
library to help build this office collection. At a minimum, it should contain at least 15 books, 5
magazine subscriptions, and 10 ODR equipment mail-order catalogs. Instructional videos/DVDs
should also be incorporated into the collection based on your mix of programs and activities.
Plan to incorporate at least two new books and one new video/DVD to the reference collection
annually.
2.4. Evaluate available staffing, equipment, transportation resources, financial objectives,
and other management considerations prior to selecting the most appropriate way to
deliver a program or service. These include:
   2.4.1. Referral. Program staff must be prepared to answer customer’s questions about local
   ODR opportunities. Stock up on maps and brochures and keep phone numbers available.
   2.4.2. Self-directed. This approach simply provides the basic resources and leaves the rest
   up to the customer. Examples of this method include providing recreational equipment for
   checkout and developing recreation areas and facilities. There is a significant limitation to
   this approach given the increasing urbanization and recreation skills of our new customers. It
   assumes the customer is already interested in the activity and has the basic skills and
   knowledge to pursue it on their own.
   2.4.3. Facilitation. Many customers have not had opportunities to develop ODR skills or are
   unaware of the many different activities available. The facilitation approach focuses on
   offering awareness, interest, entertainment programs, and conducting basic instructional
   classes.
 12                                       AFI34-110_VANCEAFBSUP 1 NOVEMBER 2013


   2.4.4. Contract services. This approach makes sense when staff levels, staff skills, or lack of
   equipment prevents offering a popular activity. Depending on the circumstances, the ODR
   program can provide equipment and transportation but the contractor conducts the actual
   activity. Information on minimum liability insurance levels and other contract requirements
   is available from NAF contracting personnel in FSS Resource Management Office.
   2.4.5. Cooperative programming. While similar to contract services, this method is more of
   a joint effort with another, generally non-commercial, organization. It is suitable when you
   may have adequate staff levels, knowledgeable staff, and equipment but require additional
   outside expertise or resources. Consider partnering with university ODR programs, local
   clubs, or other military installations. A written agreement is essential for establishing clear
   responsibilities for both partners.
   2.4.6. Direct provision. The in-house approach can provide outstanding customer service,
   build strong customer loyalty, and may generate the best financial returns. It requires
   adequate staff levels, experienced and fully qualified personnel, and all the necessary
   equipment.
2.5. Establish long-term program goals in a 5-year plan that outlines the objectives and
supporting rationale. The plan must identify the resources (manpower, training, equipment,
facilities, etc.) needed to initiate new or expanded programs. Identify when tasks, such as
training or equipment purchases, must be completed to support future program goals. Include
furnishings, equipment, bulk supplies, and resale inventory. This plan should support and justify
the 5-year NAF capital requirements budget.
2.6. Publish and distribute a quarterly or seasonal schedule with assistance from the Force
Support marketing specialist. Promote activities using a variety of methods like flyers, articles
in the base paper, daily bulletins, FSS websites, social media, direct mail (requires customer
permission), and commander’s calls. Communicate program benefits (e.g., fun, relaxation,
excitement, meeting new people) using active language. Use the Air Force Outdoor Recreation
Logo to improve customer recognition and maintain a consistent image.
2.7. Program Categories and Funding. The categories and appropriated fund (APF) support
goals for Force Support activities are described in AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of
Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Programs and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities.
Before considering any APF procurement actions, the ODR manager is responsible for ensuring
the item (e.g. equipment) is authorized APF purchase or maintenance support.
2.8. Environmental Safeguards. Work with the civil engineer and bioenvironmental offices to
ensure facilities and maintenance practices comply with applicable environmental requirements.
Include all off-base recreation areas, FAMCAMPs, and Marinas. Use minimum impact
camping, sanitation, and cooking practices on outings. Respect for the environment and careful
stewardship of natural resources must be demonstrated in all program practices.
2.9. Participation Records/After Action Reports. As a minimum, records for each activity
must include a descriptive program name, the date(s) of the program, number of participants, and
program duration in hours or beginning and ending times. To simplify annual planning and
budgeting, consider recording program expenses, required supplies and equipment, and income
along with the participation data. Using a computerized system will simplify record keeping,
enhance the collection or customer related information, and speed up reporting tasks. After
AFI34-110_VANCEAFBSUP 1 NOVEMBER 2013                                                          13


action reports should include customer feedback or suggestions, satisfaction ratings, and staff
generated suggestions for improvements or changes.
2.10. Alcoholic Beverages. Alcohol is a primary contributing factor in many mishaps.
Program OIs must include a section addressing alcoholic beverages. See AFI 34-219, Alcoholic
Beverage Program, for other requirements and restrictions.
   2.10.1. Staff will not consume or be under the influence of alcoholic beverages while on
   duty for the duration of an outing or activity. Participants should not consume alcoholic
   beverages preceding or during an activity.
   2.10.2. The installation commander must approve the availability, sales, or consumption of
   alcoholic beverages at any Services operated facility. This may include recreation areas,
   base parks, and special events and parties. Sponsors of parties or group functions are
   accountable for the responsible behavior of their group. The sponsors must submit a letter of
   request, through the FSS commander, outlining their rules for serving and consuming
   alcoholic beverages at the party or function.
2.11. Serious Incident Reporting for Services Activities. In addition to any local reporting
procedures and notification through the chain of command, FSS commanders or directors are to
notify USAF/A1S simultaneously (within 1 hour if possible) of all serious incidents.
   2.11.1. Incidents that must be reported include:
   2.11.1.1. Any major property damage to Services assets (fire, natural disaster, major aero
   club aircraft or vehicle accident, etc.).
       2.11.1.2. Any serious injury resulting in death or extended hospitalization of an
       employee or patron.
       2.11.1.3. Any incident of a sensitive nature involving Services employees or assets.
       Incidents involving lawsuits, with public affairs implications, or theft, etc. are examples
       of incidents that would be considered sensitive.
2.12. To      report     incidents      described    in   paragraph      2.11.1. go to
https://www.usafservices.com/sir/sir.aspx, click on your MAJCOM, complete the incident
information form and click send.               An e-mail notification will be sent to
incidentreporting@pentagon.af.mil as well as your appropriate MAJCOM representatives,
AF/A1S, AF/A1S2, AFSVA/CC and AFSVA/CD.
2.13. Within 24 hours of the initial notification, submit any new information by completing
and submitting another incident information form. Continue providing updates at 24 hour
intervals until requested to stop.
2.14. Questions concerning serious incident reporting and these procedures should be
directed to AF/A1S, DSN 620-8598.
2.15. Bloodborne Pathogen (BBP) Standard Compliance. The Air Force Services
community is required to comply with 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.1030,
Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Bloodborne Pathogens
Standard. The complete standard can be found on the OSHA website at http://www.osha.gov.
OSHA has issued a related directive; CPL 02-02-069, Enforcement Procedures for the
 14                                       AFI34-110_VANCEAFBSUP 1 NOVEMBER 2013


Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens, which provides clarification and more details
on complying with the BBP Standard. That directive can also be viewed on the OSHA website.
   2.15.1. A key initial step is determining which employees are considered at risk of
   occupational exposure to BBPs. CPL 02-02-069, Section XIII. 3. c. states the following: “If
   an employee is trained in first aid and identified by the employer as responsible for
   rendering medical assistance as part of his/her job duties, that employee is covered by the
   standard. See the citation policy for paragraph (f)(2) of the standard below regarding
   designated first aid providers, who administer first aid as a collateral duty to their routine
   work assignments. An employee who routinely provides first aid to fellow employees with the
   knowledge of the employer may also fall, de facto, under this designation even if the
   employer has not officially designated this employee as a first aid provider.”
   2.15.2. Lifeguards and trip leaders are clearly trained and charged with providing first aid in
   the normal course of their duties and are thus covered by the BBP Standard. You must
   identify all employees within the ODR program, such as recreational lodging housekeepers,
   who are at risk of occupational exposure and covered by the BBP Standard.
   2.15.3. The medical community, through AFI 44-108, Infection Control Program, has
   significant responsibilities for installation-wide efforts to prevent BBP infections and the
   Services community must engage with them and coordinate efforts to meet the BBP
   Standards. In addition to providing any Hepatitis B vaccinations, the local medical treatment
   facility is an ideal source of trainers for the required new employee and annual BBP refresher
   training. They may also provide help in developing the required Exposure Control Plan.
2.16. Outings and Off-Base Trips. For every off-base trip, the trip leader will file an itinerary,
customer and staff roster, and emergency action plan with the ODR manager or community
services flight chief. This ensures if bad weather, transportation problems, or mishap delay a
trip’s return, key personnel have the information needed to initiate appropriate action. Pre-trip
and departure briefings must address hazard awareness and applicable safety practices and
equipment. Basic risk management requires that customers clearly understand what to expect,
what hazards might be encountered, and what they should do to prepare or protect themselves.
Scouting trips are authorized and strongly encouraged for safety reasons. Ensure contractors
have adequate safety plans and are prepared to handle potential mishaps or emergencies before
contracts are signed. Coordinate safety plans with the installation safety office.

                                           Chapter 3

                       INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS

3.1. Playgrounds. This section applies only to playgrounds located at on-base and off-base
recreation areas managed under the ODR program. If included in the Base Natural Resource
Plan (AFI 32-7064, Integrated Natural Resources Management), use of natural resource funds,
controlled by the civil engineer, is authorized. Inspect playground structures and equipment
weekly for safety and maintenance purposes. Coordinate the inspection checklist with ground
safety. Submit a work order to base engineering to repair broken or hazardous equipment
immediately and suspend use until repaired. New or renovated playgrounds will comply with
safety and accessibility standards outlined in the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission's
(CPSC) Publication #325, Handbook for Public Playground Safety.
3.2. Outdoor Adventure Activities. Adventure programs, like whitewater rafting or mountain
climbing, carry a higher level of risk. Offer these programs only under the supervision of fully
qualified program leaders. While the overall program must be called “outdoor recreation,”
appropriate activities may be offered and marketed under the heading of outdoor adventure. The
FSS commander or director approves in writing, outdoor adventure program components. The
ODR manager retains the letter of approval on file. This ensures the chain of command
recognizes and accepts increased responsibilities that go with adventure activities. These
typically include additional staff training, higher equipment standards, higher staff to customer
ratios, special first aid and safety equipment, etc. For established programs, the ODR manager
prepares a letter for the FSS commander’s signature authorizing existing adventure activities to
continue.
3.3. Scuba Diving. Scuba programs must be taught and led by highly trained and certified
personnel. The following organizations are recognized for training and instructional programs:
International Diving Educators Association (IDEA), National Association of Scuba Diving
Schools (NASDS), National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI), Professional
Association of Diving Instructors (PADI), Professional Diving Instructors Corp (PDIC), Scuba
Schools International (SSI), and National Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) Scuba
Program and Scuba Diving International (SDI).
   3.3.1. Divers certified by other recognized scuba organizations may also participate in scuba
   diving activities and refill air tanks at Air Force facilities: United States Navy, Los Angeles
   Parks Department Underwater Unit,              Multinational Diving Educators Association,
   Confederation Mondiale des Activities Subaquatiques, and others sanctioned by the World
   Recreational Scuba Training Council (WRSTC).
   3.3.2. The manager must prepare a scuba diving OI covering local check-out procedures, use
   and rental of equipment, dive boat rules, use of floats and flags, approved air sources, state or
   host country diving rules, special rules applicable to the local area, policies on repetitive
   dives, dive profiles, and safety rules. Safety rules must include the buddy system, emergency
   signals, minimum acceptable equipment, help and rescue rules, nearest medical facilities,
   nearest recompression chamber, and mishap reporting procedures. The OI should also
   address dive depth limits and multilevel dive planning. Divers must not exceed any depth
   limitations for the qualification levels established by their certification organization. Dive
 16                                       AFI34-110_VANCEAFBSUP 1 NOVEMBER 2013


   leaders and equipment rental personnel must remind aircrew members not to fly for 24 hours
   after any scuba dive, regardless of depth. Scuba rental forms should include a section for the
   dive site location.
   3.3.3. Scuba cylinders must be visually inspected annually and bear a label with month and
   year the inspection was performed. Cylinders must be hydrostatically tested at a Department
   of Transportation (DOT) certified facility in compliance with DOT rules. Tanks, valves, and
   regulators must be inspected, serviced, and repaired by a qualified and certified scuba
   technician. Scuba cylinders must be filled with compressed air only from a source that meets
   the Compressed Gas Association's (CGA) Grade E (American National Standard Institute
   (ANSI)/CGA G7.1 '97) standard that covers recreational scuba air. The air source must be
   certified and tested every 6 months to ensure carbon dioxide is less than 1,000 parts per
   million (PPM); carbon monoxide is less than 10 PPM; hydrocarbons (as methane) are less
   than 25 PPM, and oil vapor is less than 5 mg/m3; and free of gross moisture, dust, or other
   foreign matter. Tanks used for enhanced air nitrox (EAN) diving (oxygen threshold >
   23.5%) must be clearly labeled for only EAN use and be specifically cleaned and serviced to
   accommodate enriched oxygen mixes. Air Force facilities with properly trained and certified
   personnel and fill systems may offer only EAN32 (32% oxygen) and EAN36 (36% oxygen)
   mixes.
3.4. Swimming and Aquatics. This AFI applies to all Services managed pools, beaches,
waterfronts, and aquatics programs. (See also AFOSHSTD 48-14, Swimming Pools, Spas and
Hot Tubs, and Bathing Areas.)
   3.4.1. Swimming Pool Depth Requirements.
      3.4.1.1. Diving Boards. Minimum water depth for a 1-meter diving board is 10 feet
      (3.04m) for at least 16 feet (4.88m) out from the end of the board. Minimum water depth
      for a 3-meter diving board is 12 feet (3.66m) for at least 20 feet (6.1m) out from the end
      of the board. The boards must be lowered or removed if the water is too shallow.
      3.4.1.2. Water Slides. Only feet first sliding is permitted. For water slides with a
      departure point <1 meter above the water, moderate speed and angle (<10%) of entry, the
      minimum water depth is 3 1/2 feet (1.07m) for at least 10 feet (3.05m) out from the end
      of the slide. For water slides with a departure point >1 meter above the water, high speed
      or angle (>10%) of entry, the minimum water depth is 5 feet (1.52m) for at least 15 feet
      (4.57m) out from the end of the slide. If the slide manufacturer's recommended
      minimum water depth is greater than the depths listed above, use the manufacturer's
      recommendation. For slides with an integral deceleration/landing section, follow
      manufacturer recommendations.
   3.4.2. Fences, Depth Markings, and Swimming Area Demarcations. Pools must be fenced to
   prevent anyone from accessing and accidentally falling into the pool when the facility is
   closed. Infant/toddler pools must be separated by a fence with a self-closing gate to prevent
   small children from wandering from their pool and gaining access to the main pool. The
   pool depth must be marked on the pool deck at least every 10 feet. Similar depth markings
   must be visible from inside the pool by marking the pool wall, gutter, deck coping edge, etc.
   Markings on the fence or building walls are not acceptable. A clearly visible red or black
   line, at least 4 inches wide, must be marked on the pool bottom where the slope of the bottom
AFI34-110_VANCEAFBSUP 1 NOVEMBER 2013                                                           17


  reaches the 5-foot depth point. A floating line is recommended during recreational
  swimming periods unless it interferes with lap swimming.
  3.4.3. Minimum Lifeguard Levels for Pools and Actively Guarded Waterfront Areas. At
  least two lifeguards are required to be on duty and at their stations (chair stand or deck
  patrol) during open recreational swimming. When NAF lifeguards are used to staff pools,
  admission and use fees to cover part or all of the costs associated with such costs may be
  assessed. They must wear a distinctive uniform identifying them as lifeguards. Staff levels
  must accommodate lifeguard breaks or rotations. Lifeguards must be rotated off-station, or
  given a 10 minute break, every hour. Clearing the pool of swimmers to accommodate
  lifeguard breaks is authorized. The on-duty supervisor or lead lifeguard suspends swimming
  if electrical storms become a safety threat.
     3.4.3.1. During adult lap swimming or adult instructional programs with less than 20
     participants, at least one lifeguard is required to be on duty and at his or her station. If
     the instructor is also certified as a lifeguard, he or she satisfies the lifeguard requirement
     only by remaining out of the pool and located where supervision of the entire group is
     possible.
     3.4.3.2. Swim team practices must be properly supervised by lifeguards. If the swim
     team can provide certified guards, they must be trained on local emergency response
     procedures the same as ODR staff lifeguards. Military water survival or similar training
     may be conducted in the pools without ODR staff lifeguards provided the individuals
     responsible for supervising the activity are trained on local emergency response
     procedures and military water survival/rescue.
  3.4.4. When to Add Additional Lifeguards. Staff the pool or actively guarded waterfront
  with more lifeguards in the following circumstances:
     3.4.4.1. The pool customer load exceeds the supervisory capacity of the minimum
     lifeguard requirement. The pool customer to lifeguard ratio must be maintained at, or
     below, 50 to 1. Heavily used diving boards or water slides may require more lifeguards
     even if the ratio is below 50 to 1. If beach or surf conditions warrant, bases should set a
     lower ratio.
     3.4.4.2. The pool, beach, or waterfront characteristics require additional lifeguards for
     complete supervision. The shape of swimming and diving areas may create “blind” spots
     prohibiting direct line-of-sight supervision. Add lifeguards until all areas are under direct
     line-of-sight supervision. The lifeguard’s field of view for direct line-of-site supervision
     must not exceed 180 degrees. The line-of-sight distance for pools must be less than 100
     feet. Line-of-sight distance for beaches must be determined locally based on the size of
     the swimming area, water conditions, hazards, and available rescue methods.
     3.4.4.3. If alcoholic beverages are present at pool parties, add additional lifeguards to
     reduce the customer-to-lifeguard ratio to 40 to 1 or less.
  3.4.5. Lifeguard and Aquatic Instructor Certifications and Training. Lifeguards must have,
  and maintain throughout their employment, nationally recognized certifications in lifesaving
  and water rescue methods and skills, basic first aid, and child and adult CPR. Lifeguards on
  coastal beaches must also be specifically trained in surf rescue techniques.
18                                       AFI34-110_VANCEAFBSUP 1 NOVEMBER 2013


     3.4.5.1. All lifeguards must participate in at least 1 hour of in-service training during
     each 2-week period. In-service training includes activities designed to maintain physical
     conditioning and practice emergency response procedures. The 1 hour does not have to
     be a contiguous block of time. Rescue skills must be practiced regularly and not just
     once every 2 weeks. Using a “lifeguard olympics” or “quiz show” format may help keep
     the aquatics staff enthusiastic about in-service training. Include medical/rescue personnel
     in the emergency response drill at least quarterly or twice during the summer season.
     Ensure lifeguards and other aquatic staff (swim instructors, coaches, etc.) are aware of the
     dangers of shallow water blackout and death related to breath holding, hyperventilation,
     and underwater swimming contests.
     3.4.5.2. Aquatic instructors must have, and maintain throughout their employment,
     nationally recognized certification for the activities and skill levels they will teach. This
     applies to swimming and aquatic exercise instructors. Instructors who are qualified based
     on related training and experience may operate under the supervision of a certified
     instructor.
  3.4.6. Unguarded Swimming Areas. While all swimming pools are required to have
  lifeguards; unguarded, “swim-at-your-own-risk,” natural swimming areas are permitted.
  These areas require approval from base safety, base legal, and the installation commander.
  Prominent warning signs that no lifeguards are present must be posted. Telephones, which
  can be used to call for help, should be located near unguarded swimming areas whenever
  possible. These emergency telephones must be clearly marked for easy identification. The
  base newcomer’s orientations must include a warning about the inherent hazards of using the
  unguarded swimming areas.
  3.4.7. Aquatic Equipment Standards. These standards are designed to help ensure every
  aquatic facility in the Air Force provides a quality customer experience and is fully equipped
  to handle accidents or emergencies.
     3.4.7.1. Safety and Rescue Equipment.
         3.4.7.1.1. Lifeguards must have a whistle, sunglasses, and hat which shades the face.
         Lifeguard stands must be equipped with a shade which can be repositioned as the sun
         moves. Sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 must be provided
         for all pool staff. These items help prevent sunburn, heat related illness, fatigue,
         eyestrain, and reduced vigilance.
         3.4.7.1.2. All swimming pools and actively guarded beaches and waterfronts must
         have a first aid kit that includes rescue breathing masks/barriers and latex gloves to
         prevent transmission of disease. A standard first aid kit is acceptable and one kit is
         required per pool or waterfront. To reduce the potential exposure to BBPs, the
         mask/barrier must prevent direct contact during rescue breathing. Stock more than
         one mask/guard if multiple rescue breathing situations are possible. Consider
         individual lifeguard first aid/rescue-breathing packs if guards are stationed far from
         where the central first aid/rescue kit is located.
         3.4.7.1.3. Biohazard spill kit. These kits are used to clean up blood or other
         potentially infectious material (OPIM) from pool decks or locker rooms. They
AFI34-110_VANCEAFBSUP 1 NOVEMBER 2013                                                        19


        provide a safe way to disinfect, clean up, and dispose of OPIM. One kit is required
        per pool or waterfront.
        3.4.7.1.4. Backboard with arm, torso, and leg straps and head/neck immobilization
        method. One board is required at each pool or waterfront where lifeguard or rescue
        services are provided. A head/neck immobilization system is required for each
        backboard. There are two basic systems available—semi-rigid cervical collars in
        multiple sizes or adjustable “foam” blocks method. If collars are used, all sizes of the
        collars must be available and the rescue staff properly trained to use them.
        3.4.7.1.5. Lifeguards use a variety of rescue aids depending on the situation and their
        training. For swimming pools, each lifeguard station must have a rescue tube/can.
        All rescue aids must be located close to each lifeguard station so the lifeguard can
        employ them without losing sight of the individual in distress. Lifeguards patrolling
        the deck must carry a rescue tube/can. Though not suitable for each lifeguard station,
        a ring buoy, or rescue pole fitted with a shepherd’s crook or life hook are optional
        rescue aids permitted at the pool.
        3.4.7.1.6. For actively guarded beach and waterfront areas, each lifeguard station
        must have a rescue tube/can or ring buoy. Lifeguards patrolling the dock must carry a
        rescue tube/can. Ring buoys must have at least 60 feet of line and a foot loop or
        “lemon” to prevent overthrow and loss of buoy. If a dock encloses the swimming
        area, a rescue pole fitted with a shepherd’s crook or life hook may be considered.
        3.4.7.1.7. Rescue boards or open-cockpit kayaks are required for each station on
        coastal beaches and for inland beaches if the area may require rescues more than 150
        feet from shore. Rescue watercraft are authorized in Allowance Standard (AS) 410,
        part B, and will be purchased with APFs. Because they lack an external propeller, jet
        skis may be a good choice for some beaches. Even if a “jet ski” is available for
        rescue purposes, a board or kayak is required for back up.
     3.4.7.2. Facility and Aquatic Program Equipment.
        3.4.7.2.1. Pool cover for heated pools. Insulated pool covers can reduce pool heating
        energy costs by 40-70%. They reduce chemical use and water evaporation for
        unheated pools as well. Contact the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Efficiency
        and Renewable Energy (EERE) program for more information on the benefits of pool
        covers.       The EERE program’s page on pool covers is at
        http://www.eere.energy.gov/consumer/your_home/water_heating/.
        3.4.7.2.2. Chaise lounge and chairs for outdoor or indoor pools with a suitable deck
        area. The number of these to stock depends on typical customer load and the size of
        the available deck or grass areas. A reasonable rule is 60% of daily peak customer
        load.
        3.4.7.2.3. Kick boards. These should be available for free use by fitness or lap
        swimmers and for swim team practices. Thirty kick boards should be sufficient to
        supply lap swimmers, swim team members and swim lesson students, and
        accommodate special events.
20                                        AFI34-110_VANCEAFBSUP 1 NOVEMBER 2013


         3.4.7.2.4. Pace/lap timer. Pools designated for fitness, lap, or competitive swimming
         will have at least one large, easy-to-read pace clock.
         3.4.7.2.5. Lane lines. Pools designated for fitness, lap, or competitive swimming will
         have floating lane lines separating swim lanes. If the pool is used simultaneously for
         different activities, the lane lines should be removed from areas used by the other
         programs held during lap swim periods. Wave “reducing” lane lines should be used
         during competitive swim events.
         3.4.7.2.6. Backstroke flag lines and false start/recall lines. Pools designated for
         competitive swim programs will be equipped with permanent or removable
         backstroke flag and false start/recall lines at the appropriate positions. For
         specifications and placement, consult the appropriate national governing organization
         or the Official Swimming Pool Design Compendium, available from the National
         Swimming Pool Foundation.
         3.4.7.2.7. Clock and thermometer. A large, easy-to-read clock will be available at
         every aquatic facility and a large, easy-to-read thermometer will be available at every
         outdoor aquatic facility.
         3.4.7.2.8. Water fountain or jug. A free source of clean drinking water will be
         available at every aquatic facility. A chilled water fountain is preferred. If a drinking
         fountain is not available, water jugs and paper cups will be provided free for customer
         use.
         3.4.7.2.9. Special Event Items. A set of special event or training equipment items
         will be available for use at aquatic facilities. One set per installation is required. At a
         minimum, the set must include water basketball goals, 10 pound diving brick, diving
         sticks/rings/eggs, aquatic exercise aids, portable sound system with microphone
         capability, and inflatable “inner tubes” with short or recessed inflation stems.
         3.4.7.2.10. Handicapped accessible pool lift. At bases with major Air Force medical
         facilities, contact the hospital staff to determine if the rehabilitation and physical
         therapy case load warrants installation of a pool lift. These lifts are typically suitable
         for lifting loaded backboards from the pool which adds a significant safety factor to
         pool rescue situations. Note: To meet Federal accessibility standards, a large pool
         must have two suitable access methods for people with mobility disabilities.
         Examples include pool lifts, sloped entries, transfer walls, transfer systems, or
         accessible pool stairs. For more detailed information see: http://www.access-
         board.gov/recreation/guides/pools.htm.
         3.4.7.2.11. Resale items (optional). If the facility and staffing resources permit,
         resale items should be made available at all outdoor pools. If a resale component is
         incorporated into the aquatics program, it must include sun block with a 30 or higher
         SPF rating. A mobile “snack shack” is a good solution to facility or staffing
         limitations.
  3.4.8. Flotation Aids, Pool Toys, and Aquatic Equipment. The following applies to
  swimming pools only. Only properly sized and fitted United States Coast Guard (USCG)
  approved personal flotation devices (PFD), types I, II, or III are authorized during open
  recreational swimming. “Water wings” or inflatable rings are specific examples of flotation
AFI34-110_VANCEAFBSUP 1 NOVEMBER 2013                                                          21


  aids prohibited during open swimming. Flimsy plastic flotation aids create a false sense of
  security in the minds of children and parents which often leads to a dangerous situation.
  These guidelines are consistent with the recommendations of the Council for National
  Cooperation in Aquatics (CNCA). The pool manager approves the use of pool or aquatic
  toys (water basketball hoops, inner tubes, etc.) during special events such as pool parties or
  aquatic “olympics.” Large, commercial inflatable play structures can be used if they can be
  secured safely away from the pool edges. Allow the appropriate training devices and aquatic
  equipment during instructional classes (e.g., scuba, kayaking), team practices, or fitness
  training (lap swimming, water aerobics).
  3.4.9. Minimum Age and Supervision Requirements. The following applies to swimming
  pools only. (Coordinate with youth program staff to ensure the age limits below do not
  violate local approved base youth supervision policies per AFI 34-249, Youth Programs.
  Because of the unique hazards of swimming pools, use the more restrictive age limits if there
  are differences.) Children 10 years of age or younger must be under the direct supervision of
  an individual who is at least 18 years old. One individual may not supervise more than 10
  children. Individuals who are at least 16 years of age, but less than 18 years of age, may
  provide supervision for up to three children (at least one of whom is over the age of 6),
  provided that the individual has completed the American Red Cross Babysitting Training
  Course and a copy of the certificate is on file at the pool. In such cases written authorization
  from the parent(s) of children to seek medical care for children if necessary and emergency
  contact phone number(s) for the parent(s) must also be on file at the pool.
     3.4.9.1. Children aged 11 through 13 may be left unattended only if they can
     demonstrate the ability to swim at least 12 meters (roughly 40 feet), tread water for 1
     minute, and pull themselves from the water without using the pool ladder. Children
     passing the basic water skill test should be given a card, patch, or some other
     identification for subsequent pool access. Children 10 years of age or younger may not
     use spas or hot tubs.
     3.4.9.2. At least one adult must be present and providing supervision for every 10
     children at private pool parties. Aquatics or pool activities organized by the youth
     activities or child development centers must comply with their respective staff to child
     ratios. The youth activities and child development centers are responsible for providing
     the required number of staff.
  3.4.10. Food and Beverage Limitations. Smoking, eating, or drinking is prohibited in the
  pool or at the pool’s edge. Eating, drinking, or smoking areas must be at least 10 feet from
  the pool’s edge. Glass containers are prohibited in aquatic facilities, waterfront, and beach
  areas.
  3.4.11. Reciprocal Pool Pass Privileges. Bases will offer free swimming privileges to all
  TDY personnel assigned to the base for less than a 30-day period and who present a current
  season pass from their home base. Otherwise, TDY personnel assigned to the base for more
  than 30 days will be afforded swimming privileges on the same basis as permanently
  assigned personnel.
  3.4.12. Healthy Swimming (HS). While the likelihood of a recreational water illness
  outbreak is small, our challenge is to try to keep infectious agents like Cryptosporidium out
  of our pools to begin with. This requires the informed support of our customers. The
 22                                       AFI34-110_VANCEAFBSUP 1 NOVEMBER 2013


   Healthy Swimming program, developed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and
   Prevention, is targeted towards customer education and behaviors as well as information for
   pool         operators.                Materials        on       the       HS         website
   (http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/) are free to copy and distribute. All
   Services pools will support the HS program by taking the following actions. Download and
   reproduce the materials from the HS website. These include fact sheets, guides, newsletters,
   technical links, etc. Meet with Civil Engineer and Bioenvironmental personnel to share and
   discuss the HS materials for pool operators. Print copies of the Healthy Swimming brochure
   to distribute to pool customers. A brochure will be provided whenever a pool pass is sold
   and be available at every pool. Work with the Force Support marketing and base public
   affairs staff to prepare a press release for the base paper and/or Force Support supplement.
   (Use the sample media release in the Health Professionals section of the HS site.) Post
   copies of the CDC’s “Six P-L-E-As For Healthy Swimming” sign/poster at the entrance to
   each pool and in all of the changing facilities/bathrooms. Review local operating
   instructions, pool rules, water testing and maintenance practices, and update if necessary, to
   reflect current practices, recommendations and information found in the HS materials.
   Incorporate HS materials and information into the required in-service training for aquatics
   staff.
   3.4.13. Signs. Signs are to inform and help protect our customers. However, overly long or
   busy signs that customers do not read will have no impact on their behavior. Pool mishaps
   generally fall into three categories which should be the focus of our warning signs. Ensure
   the signs cover the following three areas of emphasis. No diving into shallow water; parents
   are responsible for watching their young children; no breath holding or prolonged underwater
   swimming contests. The exact wording of the signs may vary but those three primary themes
   must be represented.
3.4. (VANCEAFB) Vance Form 70, Swimming Pool Reservation, will be used to reserve the
Vance swimming pool.
   3.4.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) One of the lifeguards on duty will be positioned on the chair
   stand and the other on the deck at all times during open recreational swim periods. During
   lap swim periods, if there are no recreational swimmers in the pool, the one required
   lifeguard will be positioned on the chair stand. If there are 20 or more lap swimmers, the
   second lifeguard will be positioned on the deck.
3.5. Off-Base Recreation Areas. Establishing an off-base recreation area requires approval
from AF/A1S. Requests for approval must be signed by the installation commander and routed
through the major command A1S and AFSVA/CC.
   3.5.1. Managers of off-base (and on-base) recreation areas required to live on-site must pay
   rent and utilities. Free housing or site rental is prohibited. Rental rates are established IAW
   AFI 329003, Granting Temporary Use of Air Force Real Property. If the manager has
   responsibilities beyond normal duty hours, his or her compensation should be handled
   through personnel/pay channels. The housing or site rental fees should be recorded as
   income through the normal accounting procedures.
   3.5.2. The manager ensures recreation area OIs provide management flexibility to
   accommodate the unique circumstances of the area. Per AFMAN 34-212, Control
   Procedures for Protecting NAF Assets, the distance from banks, the installation, and support
AFI34-110_VANCEAFBSUP 1 NOVEMBER 2013                                                          23


   services may prevent daily deposits or paperwork processing. Equipment loan and rental
   services are authorized at recreation areas. See paragraph 3.13.2 for specific requirements
   for watercraft and paragraph 3.15 for equipment loan and rental procedures. Personal safety
   and basic first aid items (sunscreen, insect repellent, bandages, etc.) should be available for
   purchase at off-base locations.
3.6. Service and Resale Operations. Offering customer services and selling products directly
related to ODR activities is authorized. Operations must comply with AFI 34-211, Army and Air
Force Exchange Service General Policies.
   3.6.1. Services. When considering which ODR services to offer, look for natural links to
   existing activities, loan and rental equipment, and resale merchandise. The full-service
   format is most common and includes ski tuning and waxing or small engine repair.
   Individual lessons or instruction, scheduled at the customer’s request, also fall into this
   category. The self-service format, common in other Services activities (e.g., computers in
   the library, photography darkrooms, etc.), is relatively untapped in ODR. Consider providing
   work space, tools, how-to books or manuals and have the customer provide supplies, parts,
   and labor. Examples include bicycle repair, fly-tying, and ammunition reloading.
   3.6.2. Resale. Assessing the level of market demand is very important before establishing a
   resale program. Resale items fall into six broad categories: souvenirs (T-shirts, patches,
   mugs); sundries (water bottles, sunscreen, eye glasses straps); general outdoor items (fishing
   tackle, clothing, day packs); specialized outdoor items (skis, tents, bicycle accessories);
   convenience items (food, beverages, toiletries, fuel); and tickets and permits (fishing
   licenses, ski lift tickets, day passes). There are several ways to serve your customers’ resale
   needs. Some require very little start-up costs.
       3.6.2.1. Allow customers to place their own orders from catalogs you provide. Payment
       is made to the vendor and the merchandise is shipped directly to the customer.
       3.6.2.2. Serve as a dealer and accept special orders. This method is commonly used for
       firearms and expensive items where carrying the inventory in-house is impractical. ODR
       accepts payment or deposit and orders the item from the vendor through normal NAF
       purchasing channels. Since the merchandise belongs to the Air Force, it must be added to
       inventory when it arrives from the vendor before the sale is completed and the
       merchandise is transferred to the customer.
       3.6.2.3. Stock merchandise for in-house sales. Establish close coordination with the
       local exchange manager to ensure your product line complements rather than duplicates
       AAFES merchandise. Consider using consignment sales to reduce the amount of funds
       tied up in inventory.
       3.6.2.4. The manager should ensure all staff are trained in effective sales techniques.
       Product knowledge is critical for successful resale operations and its absence damages the
       entire program’s reputation. Staff should also know how, when, and where to use the
       products offered for sale.
3.7. Skeet and Trap Ranges.
24                                       AFI34-110_VANCEAFBSUP 1 NOVEMBER 2013


  3.7.1. Bases must comply with Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), ground
  safety, and NAF financial and asset control procedures for receiving, storing, issuing, and
  selling firearms and ammunition.
  3.7.2. Under the Gun Control Act of 1968 (Title 18 USC Chapter 44), NAF
  instrumentalities, in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and US possessions,
  must be licensed dealers to sell firearms. As of 15 Nov 86, no license is required to sell
  ammunition only (see ATF Pub. 5300.4, Federal Firearms Regulations Reference Guide).
  Do not permit any employee access to firearms, destructive devices, ammunition, black
  powder, primers, and/or cartridge cases unless the employee has completed a DD Form 2760,
  Qualification to Possess Firearms or Ammunition, certifying he or she has not been
  convicted of a qualifying crime of domestic violence. Each customer who purchases a
  firearm must complete an ATF Form 4473, Firearms Transaction Record Part I–Over-the-
  Counter. Since this form includes a certification he or she has not been convicted of a
  qualifying crime of domestic violence, a DD Form 2760 need not be completed. Each
  customer who wants temporary access to, or use of, a firearm must complete a DD Form
  2760.
  3.7.3. Sales of firearms, ammunition, or reloading supplies must comply with the guidance
  in ATF Pub. 5300.4, Federal Firearms Regulations Reference Guide. ATF Form 4473 may
  be obtained from any ATF office. Safeguard information collected during firearm
  transactions IAW the Privacy Act of 1974. Within 30 days of closing the resale operation,
  the ODR manager must send all firearm sales records to the regional ATF office.
  3.7.4. Do not sell firearms or ammunition to anyone if the buyer would be in violation of
  state law or public ordinance. Consult with the base legal office about applicable state and
  local laws. Sales of firearms, ammunition, black powder, primers, and cartridge cases are
  prohibited to anyone with a misdemeanor or felony conviction for crimes of domestic
  violence.
  3.7.5. Overseas conditions may require additional controls and forms to comply with
  customs requirements, status of forces, or country-to-country agreements. Coordinate all OIs
  with the legal and safety offices. Under no circumstances are the controls used to be less
  stringent than those in the Gun Control Act of 1968.
  3.7.6. Facilities where ammunition reloading is planned must be approved by the safety
  office as an explosives storage location and follow the applicable safety requirements in
  AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards. AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation
  Security Program, sets additional facility standards which must be met before firearms and
  munitions are stored.
  3.7.7. The manager is responsible for maintaining a listing of all club-owned weapons
  regardless of cost, depreciation, declared value, or life expectancy. The manager or
  designated employee must inventory all weapons at the start and close of the business day
  and promptly report any discrepancies to the ODR manager and the security police. The
  firearm inventory report is provided to the resource management flight chief IAW AFI 34-
  209, Nonappropriated Fund Financial Management and Accounting. The record must show
  the weapon’s property number, serial number, caliber, location, and description.
AFI34-110_VANCEAFBSUP 1 NOVEMBER 2013                                                            25


   3.7.8. Customers and staff must wear eye and ear protection, such as shooting glasses and
   over-the-ear “muffs,” when on an active range.
   3.7.9. Services shooting ranges should take positive steps to reduce the impact of lead shot
   deposited on the ground in the course of normal operations. While these practices will not
   eliminate the need for environmental clean up when the range closes, they will reduce the
   potential for environmental problems from operations. Ranges may not be situated where
   lead shot would be deposited into wetlands, drainage areas, or other sites where lead is likely
   to reach surface or ground water systems. Steps should be taken to prevent wildlife,
   particularly waterfowl and other game birds, from using shooting ranges as feeding or “grit”
   collection areas. Lead shot harvest plans, including the financial implications, must be
   developed and incorporated into local operating instructions for Services shooting ranges.
   Ranges should obtain a copy of EPA-902-B-01-001, Environmental Protection Agency's Best
   Management Practices for Lead at Outdoor Shooting Ranges, to see if other steps could be
   taken to reduce the impact of lead shot on the environment. Applying lime (to raise soil pH
   (potential of Hydrogen) to 6.5-8.5) or phosphate (to bind the lead particles) are two low cost
   practices that help reduce lead migration.
3.8. Riding Stables. All horses must have the required inoculations for adequate protection
against local diseases. A veterinarian must declare each horse free of disease before it can be
stabled or pastured with other horses. Horse owners must pay for grazing privileges on Air
Force property IAW AFI 32-9003. Grazing fees should be collected from individual horse
owners through Services channels and consolidated for payment to the government.
Arrangements can be made with the civil engineer to establish grazing fees which take into
consideration self-help work on pasture and fences. Set stall fees to fully cover all NAF
expenses. The ODR or stable manager must prepare OIs addressing stall cleaning procedures,
safety inspections, watering and care of livestock, reporting sick animals to the owner,
maintenance of pastures, fences, facilities, and trails. All horses must receive regular veterinary
care. If a base veterinarian is unavailable, the manager may establish a NAF individual service
contract IAW AFI 64-301, Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) Contracting Policy, for veterinarian
services. Owners may make their own arrangements or permit the contract veterinarian to
provide care, drugs, and medicine on a reimbursable basis. An isolation stall should be identified
and used as necessary.
3.9. Snow Ski Areas. Mark ski trail heads with the degree of difficulty. Trails must be
inspected daily and properly maintained throughout the ski season. Post trail information signs
at the departure point adjacent to ski lift or tow systems. Cross-country ski trail signs must also
include distance and estimated skiing time. Make a backboard/immobilization system and a
rescue sled or similar system available at downhill ski areas to safely transport injured skiers. If
the installation’s ambulance or medical response services cannot support the ski area, additional
training, such as advanced first aid or wilderness first aid, is required for ski area personnel
responsible for mishap response.
3.10. Food and Beverage Operations. These operations are typically located at recreation
areas, recreational lodging facilities, skeet and trap ranges, or marinas. Employees must be
properly trained in safe food handling, preparation, and storage procedures and equipment
cleaned and inspected accordingly. Work with other Services personnel with the necessary
expertise to ensure food safety. If alcoholic beverages are sold, the staff must be trained in dram
shop principles and procedures. See AFI 34-219 for other requirements and restrictions.
 26                                       AFI34-110_VANCEAFBSUP 1 NOVEMBER 2013


3.11. Recreational Lodging. Recreational lodging includes cabins, cottages, mobile homes,
lodge rooms, pre-sited travel trailers and campers, and enclosed sleeping shelters designed to
offer overnight accommodations. They must be built and operated with NAFs. Structural repair
may be authorized under AFI 65-106.
   3.11.1. Consider Air Force Lodging program practices and policies as a starting point for
   defining levels of service and developing local OIs to govern recreational lodging operations.
   Consult AF lodging amenity and electronics standards when equipping recreational lodging
   rooms. When setting up or refurbishing recreational lodging, consider using the NAF
   contracts established for lodging and temporary lodging facilities (TLF). Consider
   developing programs and activities targeted toward lodging, TLF, FAMCAMP, and
   recreational lodging guests.
   3.11.2. Smoking is not permitted inside recreational lodging units. Smoker’s “cans” or
   similar items should be located outside each unit to accommodate guests that smoke.
   Offering feebased, tiered levels of amenities within recreational lodging units is permitted
   although purely rank-based (e.g., distinguished visitor (DV)) facilities are discouraged.
   Installations can specify and limit the number of recreational lodging units that allow pets
   and a separate pet fee is permissible. The Recreational Lodging OI must include a section
   addressing reservation, cancellation, refund, and pet policies.
3.12. Campgrounds. Undeveloped camping areas or tents-only campgrounds are Category B
activities. Natural resource funds, controlled by the civil engineer, may be used IAW AFI 32-
7064, Integrated Natural Resources Management. Areas developed primarily for recreational
vehicle camping (FAMCAMPs) are Category C. Air Force campgrounds were developed for,
and will be managed to support, recreational camping purposes. They are not to be used as a
place to live for personnel assigned to or working on an installation. If space is available, they
may be used by personnel on temporary duty to an installation as long as that use complies with
maximum length of stay policies. Customers may not use Air Force campgrounds as a place of
business. Consider offering programs for FAMCAMP guests.
   3.12.1. The manager must develop a FAMCAMP OI that includes sections addressing
   reservation, cancellation, length of stay, pet, and refund policies. The maximum length of
   stay should consider FAMCAMP capacity and customer demand but must be set below local
   requirements to establish legal state residency requirements. Back to back reservations
   designed to circumvent the local maximum length of stay limit are not permitted. At the end
   of the maximum stay period, the recreational vehicle (RV) must depart the FAMCAMP and
   installation for at least 24 hours. If two or more unreserved sites are available, a customer
   that left due to the maximum stay limit may be allowed to return to the FAMCAMP after
   satisfying the 24-hour departure requirement.
   3.12.2. All RVs in the FAMCAMP must be roadworthy and carry current registration/license
   tags or stickers. RVs in the FAMCAMP may not be skirted although tire covers are
   permissible. All tires/wheels must remain on the RVs—temporary removal for repair is
   acceptable. No freestanding storage units are allowed within the FAMCAMP sites. Any RV
   that is sold must be removed from the FAMCAMP prior to ownership being assumed by the
   buyer. For environmental reasons, no mechanical maintenance (including oil changes) or
   significant repair work may be performed, and RVs may not be washed in the FAMCAMP.
AFI34-110_VANCEAFBSUP 1 NOVEMBER 2013                                                       27


   3.12.3. Customers must clean up after their pets. Pets may not be left unattended in the
   FAMCAMP for period exceeding 2 hours. Pets should never be left unattended in closed
   vehicles in extreme heat conditions. Pets must be on a leash when outside the RV. If space
   permits, a designated dog-walk area near the FAMCAMP is recommended.
   3.12.4. FAMCAMP managers or hosts who live on-site must pay rent and utilities. Free
   housing or site rental is prohibited. If paid staff has responsibilities beyond normal duty
   hours, their compensation will be in accordance with personnel and pay policies. The
   housing or site rental fees will be recorded as FAMCAMP income through the normal
   accounting procedures.
   3.12.5. All Air Force campgrounds that collect fees for overnight RV parking are considered
   FAMCAMPs and must participate in the Frequent Camper Program. They must honor all
   valid Camper Cash certificates and stamp customer’s Frequent Camper Logbooks in
   accordance with program guidance provided by AFSVA/SVPCR. Selling Frequent Camper
   membership kits is encouraged.
3.13. Marinas. Marinas include private boat berthing or mooring and the rental of watercraft
not listed in Allowance Standard (AS)-410, Morale, Welfare, and Recreation and Physical
Training. Marina watercraft includes water ski boats, bass boats, pontoon boats, jet skis, and
sailboats over 16 feet. (Basic fishing boats with motors under 25 horsepower and sailboats less
than 16 feet are treated as equipment loan items.)
   3.13.1. Services watercraft must comply with USCG requirements which are different for
   recreational or charter boat operations. Contact the nearest USCG office for requirements
   unique to your area. Many states have been granted limited authority (33 C.F.R., Part 173,
   Subpart D) to control the numbering and equipping of recreational boats within their
   jurisdictions. In these situations, Services owned watercraft must comply with state
   guidelines. Contact the nearest USCG office for requirements unique to your area. Marinas
   must comply with federal, state, and local environmental and pollution laws and regulations.
   3.13.2. Customers must have adequate training before being allowed to operate any Services
   watercraft. The ODR manager must develop an OI covering basic customer qualification
   procedures for each type of watercraft. The staff member renting out the watercraft is
   responsible for ensuring the customer satisfies local training requirements. Basic water
   safety information (handout, short video, verbal briefing, etc.) must be provided to the
   customer prior to departure. Life jackets must be provided for all passengers and should be
   worn when the boat is under way. Give particular attention to water ski and Jet Ski
   operations. Customers must receive thorough training before driving a ski boat or operating
   a personal watercraft. This training must include proficiency testing with the same class of
   watercraft the customer will rent.
   3.13.3. Customers must keep watercraft in wet or dry storage in movable condition so it can
   be relocated for emergency or facility maintenance purposes. See AFI 34-204, Services
   Property Management, for guidance regarding lost or abandoned boats and other personal
   property.
3.14. Parachuting. Services organized parachuting activities must follow United States
Parachute Association (USPA), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), state, and local
directives. The ODR manager develops comprehensive OIs covering jump procedures with
 28                                       AFI34-110_VANCEAFBSUP 1 NOVEMBER 2013


special emphasis on safety practices. The jumpmaster for novice sport parachuting operations
must have a current USPA jumpmaster rating. The pilot of the airplane may not serve as
jumpmaster. Individual participants are responsible for safe parachuting. Each participant must
follow basic safety requirements and comply with the jump procedures OI. The ODR manager
reports any injury or loss of life resulting from parachuting as required by AFI 91-204, Safety
Investigations and Reports. Line-of-duty determinations are made as outlined in AFI 36-2910,
Line of Duty (Misconduct) Determination. (See also paragraph 2.11, Serious Incident Reporting
for Services Activities)
3.15. Equipment Loan and Rental Operations. ODR equipment loan items are purchased,
tracked, and disposed of through APF channels. (Refer to AFI 34-204) ODR equipment rental
items are purchased with NAFs (Refer to AFI 64-301). Core Customer Use Equipment
Standards are found in Attachment 4. Installations must stock the standard APF and NAF core
equipment items if the related activity is geographically appropriate. The goal is to provide
customers with a consistent range of equipment items from place to place. If verifiable customer
demand warrants, you may stock more or less than the recommended number for each item.
   3.15.1. Loan and Rental Items and Fees and Charges. There are a number of distinctions
   between equipment loan (Category B) and equipment rental (Category C) items.
       3.15.1.1. Equipment items listed in AS-410, Part B, (skis, tents, bicycles, coolers, etc.)
       are considered loan items and authorized APF support. Use of NAFs to purchase these
       items in lieu of APFs requires a waiver from the installation commander and be reported
       to your MAJCOM quarterly per AFI 34-201, Use of Nonappropriated Funds (NAFS).
       Except for specially designated outdoor adventure activity equipment, these items may be
       made available to customers for self-directed use. Loan fees for these items can only
       cover verifiable NAF expenses associated with issuing, receiving, repairing, cleaning,
       maintaining, and restocking the items. These fees are not meant to recover the NAF
       purchase price of the item or make a profit per AFI 65-106.
       3.15.1.2. Items not listed in AS-410, Part B, (campers, ski boats, snowmobiles, etc.) are
       considered rental items. Rental fees must cover all NAF expenses over the life of the
       item, anticipated replacement costs, and achieve local, MAJCOM or Air Force profit
       goals.
       3.15.1.3. Items previously listed in AS-410, purchased with APFs and retained under
       Allowance Source Code (ASC) 083, must be maintained using NAFs. They remain on
       APF equipment records until disposed of through APF channels. For APF owned items,
       set fees to recover NAF costs of administration, maintenance, and repair.
       3.15.1.4. The equipment operation manager uses the Cost-Based Equipment Pricing
       System (C-BEPS) provided by AFSVA/SVPCR, or a similar work sheet, for each type of
       equipment when establishing loan and rental fees to document how the fee was
       established. Keep the work sheet on file and review and update it annually and when
       equipment is replaced.
       3.15.1.5. Weekend and package discounts are encouraged to stimulate equipment use.
       Late fees, not to exceed the daily fee, are authorized. Recoup repair or replacement costs
       due to customer abuse or loss of items. Cleaning or damage deposits are authorized. For
AFI34-110_VANCEAFBSUP 1 NOVEMBER 2013                                                         29


     collection procedures pertaining to lost or damaged NAF property, see AFI 34-202,
     Protecting Nonappropriated Fund Assets, and for APF property see AFI 65-106.
  3.15.2. Reservation Priorities and Use. Equipment use is first-come, first-served per AFI 34-
  201, although you may offer equipment reservations. Active duty and reserve component
  personnel and their families may make reservations in advance of other authorized
  customers. Reservation priority period may not exceed 30 days. Family members under 18
  years of age must have their sponsor’s permission to check out equipment. Use AF Form
  163, Parental Authorization to Check Out Equipment or a locally approved form. Customers
  may not use loan or rental items for personal financial gain or allow individuals who are not
  authorized customers to use the items.
  3.15.3. Care, Cleaning, and Maintenance of Equipment. All equipment must be maintained
  in a serviceable and ready-to-use condition. Provide customers instructional handouts for the
  type of equipment checked out. Train staff to instruct customers on safety procedures, proper
  care, assembly, servicing, operation, disassembly, and cleaning. Establish testing or
  minimum qualification systems for potentially dangerous or easily damaged items like tillers
  or mountain bikes. Machines and special tools needed to maintain loan equipment, including
  commercial washing machines, dryers and industrial-type sewing machines, are authorized
  and listed in AS 410. Establish a written cleaning and minor repair schedule for items
  usually subjected to a high rate of wear and tear. The equipment operation manager
  establishes a written preventive maintenance schedule to inspect, care for, and clean boats,
  motors, campers, and watercraft trailers. Inspect and test propane and electrical systems on
  camping trailers between rentals. Check wheel bearings on watercraft and camper trailers
  weekly. Scuba gear, ski bindings, and ski boots must be adjusted, tested, maintained, and
  tracked by certified technicians IAW industry standards.
  3.15.4. Display of Equipment, Fees, and Policies. Use an area immediately inside the
  entrance for an attractive display of in-season and year-round issue items. Provide a self-
  service atmosphere to encourage browsing (Consider mixing resale and rental items where
  possible). Prominently post your fees, checkout and return procedures, late return, and loss
  or damage policies. Consider posting comparative fees from local rental businesses.
  3.15.5. Checkout of Equipment. A computerized system should be used to provide
  improved controls for security and audit purposes. The use of any automated system must
  comply with AFSVA/SVS standards. If a manual system is used, the FSS commander or
  director approves a locally devised Equipment Loan/Rental Receipt. These receipts must
  have sequential control numbers with an original and two copies (three part paper). The
  customer signs the receipt indicating understanding and acceptance of the rental terms and
  gets a copy. When the equipment is returned and all fees and charges settled and paid, the
  customer will receive a copy. Retain the top copy/original in the office files according to the
  Air Force RDS.
  3.15.6. Pre-printed Checklists and Agreements. Develop inspection checklists for checking
  out and checking in high-cost, high-maintenance items like boats or campers. The checklist
  information can be typed or overprinted on AF Form 2519, All Purpose Checklist.
  Depending on local terms of use policies, consider a locally devised rental agreement for
  these items. These checklists and special agreements may be integrated with a computerized
  rental system to provide consistent customer service.
 30                                         AFI34-110_VANCEAFBSUP 1 NOVEMBER 2013


   3.15.7. Equipment Support for Services Activities. Provide assistance to other Services
   activities whenever possible. If they are charging their customers a program fee, the
   equipment operation should receive reimbursement for the equipment support via funds
   transfer. The ODR manager must develop a local OI that covers fees for equipment use by
   other Services activities. ODR staff members must pay to use equipment items except under
   the following specific circumstances when approved by the manager:
       3.15.7.1. New (typically motorized) items being subjected to documented manufacture's
       “break-in” recommendations.
       3.15.7.2. Items used in conducting scouting trips or pre-trip inspection of program
       locations.
       3.15.7.3. Items used by staff during training to maintain ODR skills required in their job.
       3.15.7.4. New items that require initial (not recurring) familiarization training on proper
       set-up, use, take-down, maintenance, and transportation procedures which cannot be
       accomplished during normal duty hours.
   3.15.8. Equipment Use by Private Organizations and Other Groups. Private organizations or
   other organizations, such as the Boy and Girl Scouts, pay the standard fees for any equipment
   items they use. APF equipment cannot be loaned or rented free of charge to private
   organizations or other groups.
       3.15.8.1. Encourage esprit de corps by establishing morale function or “picnic kits” for
       unit and squadron use. Develop a local OI, approved by the FSS/Commander/Director,
       that covers free use of the picnic kits. It should include a list of items included in the kits,
       how many times per year an organization may have free use of the kits, and what
       organizational levels are eligible to request free use of the kits. The kits would be
       provided free at the written request of the unit or squadron commander or equivalent.
3.15. (VANCEAFB) Vance Form 82, Checkout of Camping Trailer, and the Vance Form
73, Receipt for Boat, will be used by Outdoor Recreation to rent these pieces of equipment
to individuals. Vance Form 71, SVS Logistics Support Center Equipment Rental Reservation
and Deposit, will be used to reserve Equipment Rental items in advance. Vance Form 79,
Supply Loan Receipt, will be used for individuals to sign for and acknowledge responsibility for
Equipment Rental items. The Vance Form 72, Equipment Support Loan Locker Checkout, will
be used for individuals to borrow loan locker items.
   3.15.1. (VANCEAFB) Any refund of fees for equipment loan and rental items will be
   approved by the 71st Force Support Squadron Commander/Director or his/her designee.
   3.15.2. (VANCEAFB) Loaning of equipment to other Services Activities (at Vance AFB or
   any other base) or units assigned to Vance AFB will require approval from the 71st Force
   Support Squadron Commander/Director or his/her designee. Each unit assigned to Vance
   AFB may borrow selected items for squadron functions twice per year. NOTE: The propane
   grill and ice drink machine may not be borrowed; these items must be rented.
3.16. Recreational Vehicle (RV) Storage. AFI 34-262, requires that owners are assessed fees
and charges for privately owned recreational vehicles, which are rendered either APF or NAF
support. Support includes paving or modifying a paved area for RV Storage, fencing or
providing gated access to an area designated for RV Storage, registering or tracking the RVs
AFI34-110_VANCEAFBSUP 1 NOVEMBER 2013                                                            31


stored in an area, providing lights or other utilities to an RV Storage area, and patrolling or
monitoring the RV Storage area. On-base residents may be granted priority and a reduced rate if
the installation commander has prohibited parking RVs in the housing areas. An RV Storage OI
should address customer eligibility, fee structure, and use policies. Key data required from all
RV storage customers include the type of vehicles to be stored in the area, proof of
ownership/title, up-to-date state (and base) vehicle registration, proof of insurance, and local
contact address and telephone number. See AFI 34-204 for guidance regarding lost, abandoned,
or unclaimed vehicles and other personal property.
3.17. Paintball. Paintball has emerged as a very popular activity and is a natural fit with many
of the skills needed in the military. Work with Security Forces and other units to encourage
incorporating paintball into training and/or morale activities. Consider military training
opportunities when developing a paintball area.
   3.17.1. Consider operational and safety factors when deciding where to put a paintball field
   or area. Clearly mark the boundaries from both the inside and the outside. Put large, easily
   seen colored markers close enough together so people do not unknowingly pass between the
   boundary markers. Each area will have a sufficiently large clear zone near the start or
   staging area where shooting marker guns is prohibited. The zone must be marked so players
   know when they have entered the zone and other players can tell who is and who is not in the
   clear zone.
   3.17.2. Players and on-course officials must wear face, eye, and ear protection. Establish
   and update clear standards for safety and protective gear. Offer “loaner” gear for people who
   show up with equipment which does not meet your safety standards. Marker guns must be
   set to shoot at 300 feet per second or less. Purchase a chronometer to check marker gun
   speed prior to allowing personally owed markers on the course or field. Consider offering
   “loaner” markers if the over-speed marker cannot be adjusted onsite.
   3.17.3. Establish a suitable method to signal “end of game” or cease-fire to players scattered
   over the entire course. This may require a mix of flags, fixed horns, and on-course referees
   to get the signal out. Once the game is over and players are returning to the start or staging
   area, no markers may be fired. Barrel covers/sleeves are the standard safety device to
   prevent injury or damage from an inadvertently fired marker. (Note: barrel plugs should not
   be used because some can be shot from a marker.) Unloading and cleaning a marker after a
   game is a good practice from both a safety and equipment maintenance standpoint. Do not
   allow markers to be cleared by firing onto the playing area after a game. Provide a
   designated place for players to fire their markers until empty.
   3.17.4. Ensure pre-game safety briefings and all course paperwork emphasize not only the
   rules but also what will happen if the rules are broken. Clearly establish the penalties for rule
   infractions, ensure everyone understands them before play, and enforce them consistently.
3.18. Ropes Courses and Climbing Walls. Ropes courses and climbing walls are excellent
tools for team building, exploring perceived personal limits, and developing leadership potential.
Successful courses and walls require a cohesive multiyear program plan, detailed operating
instructions, a thorough staff-training plan, and an adequate budget.
 32                                       AFI34-110_VANCEAFBSUP 1 NOVEMBER 2013


   3.18.1. ODR run ropes courses and climbing walls operate under the “challenge by choice”
   philosophy. Train staff to manage group pressure so individuals are free to push themselves
   only as far as they choose.
   3.18.2. Adequately secure your facilities when not in use. If the course/wall is fenced in, be
   sure the gate is locked and the fence is intact. Ensure access ladders, ropes, or haul cords are
   put away or out of reach at the close of business.
   3.18.3. Establish clear guidelines about the type of harnesses that may be used. Ropes
   courses must use both a chest and seat harness. Determine if climbing wall customers will be
   allowed to use their own harnesses after they pass inspection. Helmets are required on ropes
   courses.
   3.18.4. A well-planned and properly equipped belay system is the single most important
   “hardware” factor on a safe ropes course or climbing wall. Establish policies on who may
   serve as a belayer and how are they will be trained. Consider belay anchors or belay partner
   procedures to prevent lightweight belayers being pulled off their feet by the fall of a heavier
   customer.
   3.18.5. The ropes will be routinely “loaded” by falls and lowering, which subjects them to
   wear and tear. Every rope must have its own log which tracks how often and how it is used.
   Falls off some course or wall elements are “harder” than others so consider tracking use by
   element. Cut up or destroy retired ropes so they cannot accidentally be used again.
   3.18.6. Every course or wall must receive a thorough annual inspection by the company that
   installed it or by trained certified inspectors. Cable tension, climbing holds, and belay anchor
   points are particularly important. The company which installed the course/wall normally
   provides inspection and recertification services—check the contract. The inspection plan
   should cover annual, monthly, weekly, and per use items to check along with hardware
   maintenance and replacement plans. Train staff on how to inspect the course/wall prior to
   use.
3.19. Skate and Bike Parks. These facilities, which may be popular with youth and younger
adults, offer a mix of elements and structures for skateboarders, in-line skaters, and BMX
bicyclists. These facilities are often operated by youth centers, which limits access by other
potential customers. If a more accessible facility is desired, ODR programs can develop and
manage skate and bike parks. Extensive involvement of the potential customer base is vital in
planning a successful facility. Long-term durability of the structures and elements is a crucial
purchasing factor. Each potential user group will shape the types of structure and elements (e.g.,
mix of vertical and street elements) and will affect arrangement and total space required.
Consider separating the bicycle elements from the skateboard and in-line skate elements or
designating bikes-only time periods to avoid user conflicts. Likewise, separating younger
customers from the older customers may reduce safety concerns. These parks should include
adequate seating areas, trash cans, shade structures, water source, bicycle racks, and nearby
restrooms. Helmet use is required and additional protective gear for wrists, elbows, or knees
should be encouraged.

A2.1. Relevant Concepts.
   A2.1.1. Qualified Staff. A person fully prepared and capable of performing a function or
   providing a service in accordance with commonly accepted industry practices. A person may
   have none of the required or recommended formal training and be qualified through years of
   experience. Likewise, some people can complete the formal training and lack enough
   experience, maturity, or judgment to be considered qualified.
   A2.1.2. Nationally Recognized. A well-known training or certification organization with a
   quality reputation. For example, lifeguard training from the American Red Cross, YMCA, or
   Ellis and Associates. Dealing with a known entity makes staffing a program with qualified
   folks easier. Many training/certification programs are known only within their respective
   sports.
   A2.1.3. Certification. A form of official recognition of the successful and documented
   completion of a nationally recognized training program. Many certifications have a time
   limit on how long the certifying organization considers the training valid.
   A2.1.4. Instructional Program. Any program where the prime reason is to teach how to do
   something. They are usually called “classes” or “learn to” programs. We are holding
   ourselves out to customers as qualified to teach the skills needed to participate in an activity.
   Legally, the scope of “duty owed” to the customer is much greater than for trips and outings.
   A2.1.5. Trips and Outings. A program where the emphasis is on simply “doing” an
   activity. The customers will already have, or claim to have, the required skills and
   knowledge. Most trips and outings will inevitably include “helpful pointers” from the
   leaders to less experienced or skilled customers on how to improve. This incidental
   instruction does not push the program out of the trips and outings category. Be sure when
   promoting trips and outings, it is not stated, or implied, that the program is instructional in
   nature.
   A2.1.6. Required. The activity leader(s) must successfully complete the described training
   or its equivalent before conducting the program. If certification is involved, the certification
   must be current at the time the activity is conducted. In some cases, generally involving
   workplace safety and environmental issues, there are public laws which provide criminal
   punishment for violations.
   A2.1.7. Recommended. Completing this training is strongly encouraged if opportunity,
   scheduling, and funding allow. The benefits include improved safety practices, better
   teaching or group leadership techniques, exposure to new skills or emerging trends, and
   better understanding of changing equipment items
