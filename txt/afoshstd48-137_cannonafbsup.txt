representative can be reached via cell phone at 749-4083.
2.8.4. (Added) Shops using self-contained breathing apparatuses (SCBAs) must coordinate with
the Fire Department to obtain annual training on the use and maintenance of SCBAs.
2.8.7. (Added) Ensure military gas mask inserts are not worn with industrial respirators.
Individuals requiring the use of corrective lenses must order inserts from the manufacturer of the
respirator they have been authorized. Upon receiving inserts, report to the Optometry Clinic

4.2.1.5. (Added) BEF will note any work processes or existing air sampling results which may
indicate the need for respiratory protection. Respirator selection will be accomplished by BEF
personnel using the respirator selection flow chart found in AFOSH STD 48-137 and AF Form
AFOSHSTD48-137_CANNONAFBSUP 23 FEBRUARY 2011                                                       3


2773, Respirator Selection Worksheet. The completed AF Form 2773 will be filed in the
appropriate BEF case file.
5.1.1.5. (Added) Public Health has classified Cannon AFB as low-risk regarding Tuberculosis
(TB).
5.1.1.6. (Added) Qualitative fit testing and training on proper use and limitations of FFPD will
be provided by BEF at the time of FFPD issue.
5.1.1.7. (Added) FFPDs are considered contaminated and not reusable after wear to protect a
worker from someone with confirmed or suspected TB. FFPDs should be thrown away if they
become unserviceable. Some factors to consider are physical damage (e.g., crushing, tearing)
and soiling during a high-risk procedure.
6.2.1. (Added) 29 CFR 1910.134 authorizes the local physician or licensed health care provider
(PLHCP) to determine which health and physical conditions are pertinent and consequently
addressed in the medical evaluation.
6.2.2. (Added) Any response that indicates the individual may have difficulty wearing a
respirator will be reviewed by a PLHCP and scheduled for further medical evaluation as
appropriate. After an individual has been interviewed and/or examined by a PLHCP, the PLHCP
will then annotate on the PLHCP’s recommendation form whether that individual is qualified or
not qualified for respirator wear and/or any restrictions.
6.2.5.1. (Added) To maintain the confidentiality of the medical questionnaire, if responses
indicate no problems with wearing a respirator and the individual is qualified to wear a respirator
without restrictions, then the PLHCP will annotate that the worker is qualified for respirator fit
testing and will sign and stamp the PLHCP’s recommendation form. BEF will provide a copy to
the worker at the time of their fit test.
6.2.5.2. (Added) If the PLHCP recommends respirator use with restrictions, Physical Exam
Section personnel will forward a copy to the worker’s supervisor, a copy to BEF for fit testing,
and a copy for the medical record along with the Medical Questionnaire. If the individual is a
civilian, a copy must be sent to the civilian personnel office. BEF will then provide the
PLHCP’s recommendation form to the worker at the time of their fit test.
7.1. (Added) A respirator fit test will be conducted for each wearer of a tight-fitting respirator at
least once every 12 months unless required more frequently by a specific standard. Fit testing
will be accomplished using quantitative protocols. The work place supervisor ensures that the
worker’s medical evaluation is current and correct. The supervisor will send a roster of all
personnel on the respiratory protection program for their shop that require fit testing to BEF on a
quarterly basis.
8.1. (Added) BEF will provide the initial training of supervisors who have the responsibility of
overseeing work activities of one or more persons who must wear respirators (Supervisor’s
Initial Respiratory Protection Training). This training will be repeated annually or whenever the
supervisor moves to a different work place on the respiratory protection program. Training shall
be documented on the individual’s AF Form 55 or equivalent and the AF Form 2767,
Occupational Health Training and Protective Equipment Fit Testing Record, in the shop folder
maintained by BEF.

8.1.1. (Added) BEF will provide initial training to respirator wearers. Initial training will be
completed for all respirator wearers prior to working in an environment requiring the use of
respiratory protection. Initial training for users of air-purifying and airline respirators will be
accomplished during the initial fit test. Training of emergency response and rescue teams using
SCBAs will be accomplished by the 27 SOCES Fire Department. Training shall be documented
on the individual’s AF Form 55 and the AF Form 2767 in the shop folder maintained by BEF.
8.2. (Added) BEF will provide annual instruction and retraining to respirator wearers.
Retraining shall include appropriate provisions of the initial training and other provisions
deemed necessary by BEF. Training shall be documented on the individual’s AF Form 55 and
the AF Form 2767 in the shop folder maintained by BEF.
8.7. (Added) Teams that are established for the purpose of responding to emergencies or
rescues, such as the fire department, shall be properly trained in the use of respirators. This
training will be accomplished annually by the 27 SOCES Fire Department.
9.2.1.1. (Added) Shared respirators will be cleaned and sanitized before being worn by the next
individual as well as at the end of each day the respirator is used. Pre-packaged cleaning wipes
are not authorized for use during end of day cleaning and sanitizing.
9.2.2.2. (Added) Individual respirator wearers will inspect the respirator immediately before
each use and after cleaning to ensure it is in proper working condition. This inspection will
include inlet valve assemblies, tightness of connections, abnormal wear or defects, and the
proper installation of filters, canisters, or cartridges.
9.2.2.2.1. (Added) The work place supervisor, or an individual appointed by the supervisor in
writing, will ensure each airline, SCBA and respirator stored in the work place for emergency or
rescue use are inspected at least every 30 days. AF Form 1071, Inspection/Maintenance Record,
will be used to document this inspection. This inspection will also include the compressors used
with the air-supplied systems and proper functioning of regulators, alarms and other warning
systems. The 27 SOCES Fire Department and other agencies conducting breathing air sampling
shall contact BEF to receive a sample number prior to sampling. These agencies shall provide
copies of these sample results to BEF no later than two weeks after they are received from the
analytical lab.
10. (Added) Procedures for Program Evaluation: The annual BE respiratory protection program
evaluation will be presented to the Aerospace Medicine Council and the Wing Energy
Environmental Safety and Occupational Health Council.
