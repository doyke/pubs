  6.12. (Added) Summary. As Air Force professionals and leaders, we are fundamentally
  obligated by tradition and ceremony to instill and develop our people’s professional traits,
  self-confidence, individual pride, motivation, enthusiasm, and most importantly, their self-
  esteem. We can do these things best by recognizing their talents and progressively assisting
  them in developing a true sense of personal and professional pride toward our profession, the
  profession of arms. Recognizing our people's qualities, capabilities, accomplishments, and
  achievements is a leadership responsibility that can never be discounted. A "pat on the back"
  will stimulate their internal desires to consistently strive to be their best and will allow us to
  express true appreciation for their sacrifices, contributions, efforts, successes, and hard work
  to ensure mission accomplishment. Recognition is everyone’s responsibility and rewarding
  people ultimately enhances unit, base, and Air Force missions. Formal and informal
  recognition may be accomplished in a variety of ways and the administration of such
  programs must promote pride, morale, camaraderie, and esprit de corps. A myriad of
  programs are outlined to assist all levels of leadership in fulfilling this obligation.
  Recognition is a "One Team…One Fight" effort and demands the utmost dedication, support,
  and loyal input of all leadership levels. It requires each commander and supervisor to fully
  support, promote and energize a variety of programs and options to fulfill this particular
  supervisory function. Remember these two important thoughts: 1) We have a large number
  of our people doing great things and accomplishing much; and 2) Recognition and the
  processes to recognize should never be a burden to any supervisor or leader, but a pleasure.
