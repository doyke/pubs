Section B—Ground Safety

10. Scope. The squadron/unit ground safety program is the squadron commander’s program and
must be specifically oriented to their mission. The squadron/unit safety program should focus on
the application of mishap prevention and Risk Management (RM) principles and procedures. It
should also be designed to provide safety coverage in all unit ground activities involving Air
Force personnel, material, equipment, and facilities, both on/off duty and on/off base.
11. Responsibilities.
   11.1. USRs will:
       11.1.1. Comply with unit inspection responsibilities as outlined in paragraph 5.
       11.1.2. Accomplish spot inspections on at least one work center per month, to encompass
       the entire unit throughout the year. The inspections should encompass both program
       management and facility inspections. The wing safety sharepoint site has checklists that
       may be used for these inspections. All identified hazards requiring an IJO 4283
       “Individual Job Order” will be routed through the Director of Public Works (DPW) by
       the facility manager. If a RAC is assigned, the IJO 4283 will be tracked using the hazard
       tracking log.
           11.1.2.1. USRs will maintain documentation of these inspections and ensure follow-
           up is made when required. As a minimum, the inspection log must identify the date
           of inspection, area inspected, any discrepancies noted, corrective actions taken or
           initiated, and overall status of items (closed, or open pending stated action) and status
           date.
           11.1.2.2. Deficiencies that cannot be corrected at the unit level should be directed to
           the 62 AW/SEG office for assistance.
       11.1.3. Maintain a Hazard Tracking Log for all uncorrected hazards and deficiencies
       assigned a RAC not corrected within 30 days from the date of discovery. Follow-up will
       be conducted monthly until an estimated completion date (ECD) has been established.
       Once an ECD is known, follow-up will be conducted on a quarterly basis until the hazard
       is corrected.
       11.1.4. The USR will coordinate with the unit or wing RM monitor to integrate risk
       management into safety. Ensure the principles of RM are actively implemented and used
       within the unit.
       11.1.5. Disseminate safety information and assist supervisors in developing briefings.
       USR will conduct monthly safety briefings. A separate safety meeting is not required,

   25.2. After normal duty hours, severe weather alert notification is received by the MOC
   from Command Post dispatcher. The on duty maintenance supervisor will immediately
   notify all munitions maintenance personnel on duty of impending weather conditions.
   25.3. The following procedures apply in the event of an electrical storm alert:
      25.3.1. For areas not supported by a Lightning Protection System (LPS); explosives
      operations will cease when a Lightning Watch is issued; a Lightning Watch is in effect 30
      minutes prior to thunderstorm being within 5 nautical miles (nm) of McChord Field.
      NOTE: If electrically initiated explosive devices can be rapidly repackaged in approved
      D.O.T. specified packaging, evacuation from facilities with approved serviceable LPS is
      not required.
      25.3.2. All explosives operations will cease and personnel will be evacuated to a
      predetermined public traffic route distance when a Lightning Warning is issued; a
      Lightning Warning is in effect whenever any lightning is occurring within a 5 nm radius
      of McChord Field.
   25.4. Aircraft load crews will be kept advised through radio contact with the 62d Aerial Port
   Squadron Air Terminal Operations Center (ATOC) (62 APS/TROO) of weather changes.
   25.5. In the event operations in progress cannot be immediately terminated due to sensitivity
   or urgency, the operation will be continued until a safe point can be reached to suspend the
   operation. This will be accomplished using only the minimum manpower necessary to reach
   a safe stopping point. Upon completion or suspension of the operation, affected personnel
   will also evacuate the area as directed by senior supervisor.
   25.6. The senior munitions supervisor on duty will notify personnel when to evacuate the
   area and will conduct a building/area search to ensure all personnel have departed the area.
   The senior munitions supervisor will be the last person to leave the storage area.
   25.7. Required evacuation distances and a central gathering point will be predetermined at
   the beginning of all explosives operations and briefed in pre-operational safety briefings. An
   account of all personnel will be taken by the senior munitions supervisor at the central
   gathering point to ensure accountability of all personnel.
   25.8. Explosives operations will not resume until the severe weather threat has passed as
   determined by the installation weather services as outlined in 62 AWI 15-1 (Weather
   Support).
