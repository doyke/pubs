SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision incorporates Interim Change 2005-1 and aligns this guidance with the revised Air Force Pol-
icy Directive (AFPD) 31-6, Industrial Security. Revisions include renumbering the chapters; updating
office symbols and publication references; requiring the identification of government information and
sensitive resources that require protection in classified contract documents; mandating the integration of
on-base contractor operations into the installation information security program per AFPD 31-6; requiring
the execution of a security agreement with contractors that perform contractual services on Air Force
installations and require access to classified and gives installation commanders the discretionary authority
to also require the execution of an security agreement with on-base contractors that require access to sen-
sitive unclassified information or frequent "entry" to the installation; clarifying responsibilities and proce-
dures for processing National Interest Determinations (NIDs); requiring a review of the DD Form 254,
Contract Security Classification Specification, at two year intervals; requiring subcontractors that per-
form contractual services on Air Force installations to execute a Visitors Group Security Agreement
(VGSA) when execution is required per this instruction; requiring contractors that use government infor-
mation technology (IT) and automated information systems (AISs) to undergo a background investigation
prior to IT usage; and eliminating the requirement to use the DD Form 696, Industrial Security Inspection
Report. (NOTE: As used in this publication, the term “security review” is not synonymous nor does it
negate the “security and policy review” requirement of AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Proce-
dures. The term "sensitive unclassified information" refers to information identified in a classified con-
tract that has been marked "For Official Use Only (FOUO)" per DOD 5200.1-R, Information Security
Program, and is exempt from release under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)). A bar ( | ) indicates
a revision from the previous edition. The entire text of the IC is at the last attachment.
(ACC) This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Revisions include
updating office symbols and publication references; requiring a review of the DD Form 254, DoD Con-
tract Security Classification Specification, at five year intervals; outlining procedures for coordinating
and processing DD Forms 254; allowing contractor personnel to perform security manager duties when
associated with Special Access Programs (SAPs); providing the Air Intelligence Agency Office of Secu-
rity (HQ AIA/SO) supervision and oversight authority of AIA generated Sensitive Compartmented Infor-
mation (SCI) contracts along with supervision and oversight of non-SCI classified information
maintained in AIA Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIF); identifying the Servicing
Security Activity Authorized Requester of Investigations for obtaining contractor trustworthiness and
reliability determinations; and requiring the use of the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) to
verify the personnel security clearance level for contractor personnel located on or visiting Department of
Defense (DoD) activities.

        1.8.1.4. The ISPM is responsible for notifying other AF activities, e.g., contracting office, Air
        Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), when appropriate.
     1.8.2. Reporting Security Violations.
        1.8.2.1. A designated on-base “cleared facility” reports the loss, compromise, suspected compro-
        mise or other security violations pursuant to the NISPOM through the ISPM, who in-turn is
        responsible for notifying the CSO.
        1.8.2.2. On-base integrated visitor groups report such incidents and/or information in accordance
        with AFI 31-401 to the ISPM via the AF activity security manager. This reporting requirement
        must be specified in the VGSA, if applicable. The commander of the AF activity being supported
        appoints an assigned federal employee (military or civilian) to conduct the preliminary inquiry in
        accordance with AFI 31-401, Chapter 9.
        1.8.2.3. The CSO and ISPM report significant contractor security violations and compromises

                                                Chapter 2

                                      SECURITY CLEARANCES

2.1. Facility Security Clearances (FCLs).
     2.1.1. Sponsoring FCLs. The contracting office (CO) is responsible for Facility Security Clearance
     (FCL) sponsorship. Defense Security Service is the authorizing agent for the FCL. DSS establishes
     and maintains all FCLs within the NISP. Also see DOD 5220.22-M, DOD 5200.2-R, Personnel Secu-
     rity Program, AFPD 31-5, Personnel Security, and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Man-
     agement.
        2.1.1.1. To request an FCL sponsorship, write to the CSO with oversight responsibility for the
        sponsored facility.
        2.1.1.2. Give the full name for the sponsored facility, its physical and mailing address, telephone
        number, and a specific point of contact at the facility, when known. Give the full name, job title,
        and direct-dial telephone number of the Air Force sponsor.
        2.1.1.3. Establishing final FCLs through DSS may take several months. When circumstances do
        not permit such delays, sponsors may request an interim FCL through DSS.
     2.1.2. Sponsoring Interim FCLs. DSS automatically processes all requests for Confidential and
     Secret FCLs for interim clearances when possible. However, Air Force sponsorship of interim Top
     Secret FCLs must be justified on a case-specific basis in accordance with DOD 5220.22-R. To request
     a Top Secret interim FCL, the CO prepares and routes sponsorships through command channels to the
     MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU commander for approval. Each request must include these items:
        2.1.2.1. An explanation of why an interim Top Secret FCL would prevent a crucial delay in the
        award or performance of a classified contract.
        2.1.2.2. A listing giving the legal name of the facility being sponsored, its complete street
        address, and the names and positions of people who are applying for interim Top Secret access
        authorization.
        2.1.2.3. The address of the authorizing DSS.
     2.1.3. Establishing FCLs. DSS establishes and maintains FCL for contractor operations participating
     in the NISP.
        2.1.3.1. The ISPM with oversight responsibility for a cleared facility conducts required security
        reviews of the operation and assists the CSO, as necessary.
        2.1.3.2. The ISPM also conducts surveys and/or administrative inquiries pertaining to an on-base
        cleared facility as requested by the CSO and ensures contractor compliance with
        DOD 5220.22-M, NISPOM.
        2.1.3.3. Complete the survey by using the DD Form 374, Facility Security Clearance Survey
        Data Sheet, [DOD 5220.22-R], or an equivalent/acceptable automated format when conducting
        survey for an on-base cleared facility and forward a copy to the CSO.

2.2. Contractors with Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI).
AFI31-601_ACC_I 18 OCTOBER 2005                                                                       13


   2.2.1. The CSO tells COs if a contractor performing on a classified contract has foreign ownership,
   control, or influence (FOCI) or whether it can be negated. Such influence might jeopardize the secu-
   rity of classified information held by the contractor.
   2.2.2. To resolve a FOCI problem, the CSO may establish a facility clearance that limits the level and
   type of classified information to which a FOCI contractor has access. Such restrictions might affect
   ongoing, pending and future classified contracts with the contractor. The CO should discuss this
   impact with the ISPM and servicing Foreign Disclosure office.
   2.2.3. The CO considers sponsoring a National Interest Determination (NID) after receiving written
   justification from the requesting program office or activity. This justification must address and
   explain how the FOCI contractor’s product or service is crucial or is the sole available source to the
   AF. If applicable, the program or activity must also provide a written explanation when contract can-
   cellation would cause unacceptable delays for mission-essential weapons systems in the field or for
   support organizations.
      2.2.3.1. The requesting program office or activity is responsible for obtaining written release
      approval authority from the functional owner of the “proscribed information,” prior to submitting
      the NID to the contracting office. The program office or activity contacts the OCA for Top Secret
      (TS), NSA for Communications Security (COMSEC), DCI for Sensitive Compartmented Infor-
      mation (SCI), and DOE for Restricted Data (RD) or Formerly Restricted Data (FRD) to obtain
      release approval. (NOTE: All release determination request (NID) involving/for SCI must be
      submitted to HQ USAF/XOIIS for review, coordination and processing).
      2.2.3.2. The CO reviews, validates, and processes the NID and associated written approvals as
      follows:
          2.2.3.2.1. Forward request for NID related to special access program (SAP) performance
          through the appropriate SAP and command channels to the Deputy for Security and Investiga-
          tive Programs, Office of the Administrative Assistant (SAF/AAZ), 1720 Air Force Pentagon,
          Washington, D.C. 20330-1720 for approval.
          2.2.3.2.2. Forward request for non-SAP NID through command ISPM channels to HQ USAF/
          XOS-FI for review and coordination. The NIDs are then be forwarded to SAF/AAZ for review
          and endorsement.
      2.2.3.3. SAF/AA endorse the NID and forwards it to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense
      for Counterintelligence and Security (OSD-USD/I), 5000 Defense Pentagon, Washington, D.C.
      20301-3040, for final approval.

2.3. Contractor Personnel Security Clearances (PCLs).
   2.3.1. The Defense Security Service grants and maintains contractor PCLs. DSS also terminates con-
   tractor PCLs when the contractor no longer needs them or when a contractor employee is terminated.
   Administrative termination of a PCL carries no adverse implications regarding the employee or the
   contractor.
   2.3.1. (ACC) The company’s security office will submit investigation requests for contractors requir-
   ing access to classified information.
   2.3.2. The Directorate for Industrial Security Clearance Review, DOD Office of General Counsel,
   may suspend or revoke contractor PCLs following due process.
14                                                              AFI31-601_ACC_I 18 OCTOBER 2005


     2.3.3. DSS automatically processes all requests for Confidential or Secret PCLs for interim clear-
     ances, where possible.
     2.3.4. When a contractor employee who is not cleared for access to Top Secret information needs
     such access to perform on an Air Force classified contract, the employing contractor may sponsor the
     individual for an interim Top Secret PCL.
        2.3.4.1. The contractor should send requests to the CO who seeks concurrence of the system pro-
        gram office (SPO), system manager (SM), or program manager (PM).
        2.3.4.2. The contractor's request should document clearly why the individual needs an interim
        PCL, why contract requirements may not be satisfied with another individual more suitably
        cleared, and what the potential adverse impact would be on contract performance if an interim
        PCL were not granted. The contracting officer will deny contractor requests that do not meet
        these criteria.
        2.3.4.3. The CO routes the appropriate contractor’s request for interim Top Secret PCLs to the
        MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU commander for approval.
        2.3.4.4. The CO sends favorably endorsed requests to the contractor, who then includes the
        endorsement in the personnel security questionnaire package for transmission to DSS for action.
        The CO promptly returns denied requests.

2.4. Processing Trustworthiness Determinations.
     2.4.1. When contractors require unescorted entry to restricted areas, access to sensitive unclassified
     information, access to government automated information systems (AIS) and/ or sensitive equipment,
     not involving access to classified information, the contractor’s personnel security questionnaire is pro-
     cessed by the sponsoring Air Force activity per DOD 5200.2-R and AFI 31-501.
     2.4.1. (ACC) The servicing security activity authorized requester of investigations submits the appli-
     cable background investigation to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for contractor trust-
     worthiness and reliability determinations. This only applies to contractors who do not require access
     to classified information, but occupy positions of trust.

2.5. Reciprocity. The CO, ISPM, and other installation security disciplines offices of primary responsi-
bility (OPRs) work together to resolve issues pertaining to reciprocity, as applicable to inspections, sur-

                            SECURITY TRAINING AND BRIEFINGS

3.1. Security Training Requirements.
   3.1.1. Air Force classified solicitations and/or contracts [Statement of Objectives (SOO), Statement
   of Work (SOW), Request for Bid (RFB), Request for Quote (RFQ), VGSA, etc.] may stipulate con-
   tractor compliance with and participation in pertinent Air Force, command and installation security
   training programs when performance or services will occur on an Air Force installation.
   3.1.2. When specified in an executed VGSA, AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Manage-
   ment, security training requirements satisfy the NISPOM training provision for on-base integrated vis-
   itor groups. Other Air Force functionals and/or security discipline OPRs may use this training
   provision for operational efficiency, however the specific requirements must be identified in the
   VGSA.
   3.1.3. When an on-base contractor operation is designated as a cleared facility, the ISPM will provide
   the initial facility security officer (FSO) briefing in accordance with the NISPOM and CSO guidance.
   3.1.4. Air Force unit security managers or security officers will provide information security program
   training (initial, refresher and annual) and other security awareness support to integrated visitor
   groups. The AF activity, working in concert with the ISPM, will incorporate language into the
   VGSA, which requires visitor group personnel to attend and/or receive information security training
   per DOD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401, Chapter 8. Unit security managers will ensure integrated visitor
   group personnel are included in their security education program.

3.2. Security Briefing/Debriefing Requirements.
   3.2.1. Management officials of the on-base cleared facility visitor groups are responsible for ensuring
   their employees receive all required security briefings and debriefings as mandated by the NISPOM.
   3.2.2. For integrated visitor groups, DOD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401 security training requirements
   are equivalent to and satisfy the training requirements of NISPOM, where appropriate. On-base con-
   tractor management officials are responsible for ensuring their personnel’s attendance and satisfying
   NISPOM documentation requirements.
   3.2.3. The ISPM will invite on-base cleared facility, Facility Security Officers (FSOs) and/or security
   representatives, to the installation’s information security manager meetings.

                                                 Chapter 4

                           SECURITY SPECIFICATIONS AND GUIDANCE

4.1. Issuing Security Classification Guidance.
     4.1.1. The AF program, project, activity and contracting office (CO) implements NISPOM, DOD
     5200.1-R, and installation security requirements through contract documents. Only COs can sign,
     modify or negotiate changes to contracts.
     4.1.2. When a contractor requires access to classified information, the AF program, project or activity
     prepares the required DD Forms 254, DOD Contract Security Classification Specifications. The
     contractor should use the security requirements in this form to accurately estimate the cost of security
     measures. More detailed security requirements are specified in the statement of work (SOW), state-
     ment of objectives (SOO), performance work statement (PWS), Visitor Group Security Agreement
     (VGSA), etc.
     4.1.2. (ACC) Use Air Force Handbook 31-602, Industrial Security Program, Figure 9.1, Instructions
     for Preparing DD Form 254, when accomplishing DD Forms 254.
     4.1.3. The responsible AF program, project, or activity will identify (by title, functional OPR, and
     approval date), the specific security classification guidance or guides (SCGs) applicable to the con-
     tract in Block #13 of the DD Form 254. The AF activity/program will provide copies of the SCG to
     the contractor prior to the contract commencing.

4.2. DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specifications.
     4.2.1. The AF program, project or activity prepares a draft DD Form 254 for each classified contract.
     When drafting the DD Form 254s, the program, project or activity will consult with the CO, ISPM and
     other installation security discipline or functional OPRs affected under the terms of the solicitation/
     contract to ensure accuracy. Once drafted, the draft DD Form 254 is forwarded to the CO for process-
     ing. The contractor should use the security classification/declassification specifications and other con-
     tractual security requirements listed in the DD Form 254 to accurately estimate the cost of security.
     4.2.1. (ACC) The requesting Air Force (AF) activity will process the draft DD Form 254 for coordi-
     nation with all affected security disciplines and functional areas, as appropriate.
     4.2.2. The CO reviews and coordinates the draft DD Form 254 with all affected security disciplines
     and functionals, as appropriate. This action ensures that approved security guidance is being provided
     to the contractor. Once the review has been completed, the requesting AF entity/activity incorporates
     the necessary changes and prepares and forwards an original DD Form 254 to the CO for subsequent
     approval and signing.
     4.2.2. (ACC) The requesting AF activity coordinates the draft and original DD Form 254 with all
     affected security disciplines and functional areas, as appropriate.
     4.2.3. Prior to signing the original DD Form 254, the CO will verify that all affected security disci-
     plines and/or functional OPRs have reviewed and coordinated on the draft DD Form 254. This review
     and coordination action will be recorded/annotated in Block 13 (office symbol, date and initial’s of
     reviewer) of the draft DD Form 254. The CO will file and maintain a copy of the annotated draft DD
     Form 254 in the respective contract file. When SAPs are involved, coordinate draft and original DD
AFI31-601_ACC_I 18 OCTOBER 2005                                                                       17


   Form 254 with the office responsible for SAP security oversight. Keep DD Form 254 for collateral
   programs and SAPs unclassified, whenever possible.
   4.2.3. (ACC) All affected security disciplines and/or functional OPRs will review and coordinate on
   the original DD Form 254. Coordination will be annotated in Block 13 of the original DD Form 254.
   The Contracting Officer will file and maintain a copy of the coordinated original DD Form 254.
   4.2.4. (Added-ACC) The ACC Special Security Office (SSO) is responsible for approving security
   attachments outlining contractor security requirements for SCI, establishing SCI facilities, granting
   SCI access, and coordinating on any DD Form 254, to include requests for bid or proposal, original
   DD Forms 254 for awarded contracts, and revised and final DD Forms 254 (if issued) that require SCI
   access. ACC SSO can delegate this responsibility, in writing, to servicing Special Security Officers.
   HQ AIA/SO will perform these tasks for AIA generated contracts requiring SCI access. The system,
   program, or project manager will ensure DD Forms 254 and security attachments are coordinated with
   the installation SSO, ACC SSO or HQ AIA/SO as applicable. The ACC Advanced Programs Security
   Branch (HQ ACC/A8ZX) is the sole authority for approving security attachments outlining contractor
   security requirements for Special Access Program (SAP), establishing SAP facilities, granting SAP
   access, and coordinating on any DD Form 254, to include requests for bid or proposal, original DD
   Forms 254 for awarded contracts, and revised and final DD Forms 254 (if issued) that require SAP
   access throughout ACC.

4.3. Reviewing and Certifying the DD Form 254.
   4.3.1. The ISPM reviews the draft and original DD Form 254 to ensure that the security classification
   guidance is accurate, approved and appropriate. However, the ISPM only annotates Block 13 of the
   draft DD Form 254. Other security requirements are incorporated into the SOW, SOO, PWS, VGSA,
   etc.
   4.3.1. (ACC) The ISPM will annotate Block 13 of the original DD Form 254.
   4.3.2. The AF program, project or activity reviews the DD Form 254 and applicable security classifi-
   cation/declassification guidance at least once every five years or as required, to ensure accuracy and
   currency. When changes are necessary, the contract will be modified, if appropriate and revised guid-
   ance issued.
   4.3.2. (ACC) The Contracting Officer will ensure the System, Program, or Project Manager reviews
   the DD Form 254 at least once every five years or as required, to ensure accuracy and currency. The
   DD Form 254 does not have to be re-accomplished if changes are not required.
   4.3.3. The CO certifies (signs) the DD Form 254, Block 16e. At the CO discretion, this authority may
   be delegated (in writing) as authorized by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) or supplemen-
   tation thereto.

4.4. Distribution of the DD Form 254.
   4.4.1. When DSS is relieved of security oversight responsibility for cleared facilities performing on
   SCI or SAP programs, furnish Headquarters DSS, 1340 Braddock Place, Alexandria VA 22314-1651,
   a copy of the DD Form 254.
   4.4.2. When a contractor’s performance will be on Air Force installation, the AF program, project or
   activity must identify/specify all contract performance locations, if known, on the DD Form 254.
18                                                             AFI31-601_ACC_I 18 OCTOBER 2005


     When the contract is performed elsewhere, the CO will provide a copy of the signed DD Form 254 to
     that location’s ISPM.
     4.4.3. Procuring Contracting Officers (PCOs), their designated representatives, including Adminis-
     trative Contracting Officers (ACOs), distribute DD Form 254.

4.5. Visitor Group Security Agreement (VGSA).
     4.5.1. Execute a VGSA with all contractor operations located on Air Force installations that will
     require access to classified information. At the IC’s discretion, the VGSA execution requirement may
     be extended to contractors performing on contracts that require access to sensitive unclassified infor-
     mation, sensitive resources or frequent "entry" to the installation.
     4.5.2. The installation ISPM, security disciplines and functional OPRs work in concert with the AF
     program, project and/or activity to develop the Visitor Group Security Agreement (VGSA) require-
     ments. The requirement to execute a VGSA is in addition to preparing the DD Form 254.
     4.5.3. The VGSA must address those security requirements and/or procedures that are unique to the
     installation for which the contractor will be held contractually liable. VGSAs need only address those
     areas of security, safeguarding and/or protection that have not been covered elsewhere within the con-
     tract, DD Form 254, SOW, SOO, PWS, etc.
     4.5.4. The ISPM is the technical OPR for development and preparation of the VGSA. For coordina-
     tion purposes, the ISPM routes the VGSA to all installation security discipline OPRs and/or other
     agencies lending expertise to the contractual security requirements.
     4.5.5. The ISPM signs the VGSA on behalf of the installation commander. The ISPM forwards a
     copy of the executed/signed VGSA to the contracting officer who awarded the contract or to the con-
     tracting officer’s designated representative, when appropriate.
     4.5.5. (ACC) The ISPM will maintain the original executed/signed Visitor Group Security Agree-
     ment (VGSA). Copies of the executed/signed VGSA will be provided to the authorized company offi-
     cial, visitor group security representative, and government sponsoring agency security manager.
     4.5.6. An authorized company official shall sign the VGSA. The CO will file a copy of the authori-
     zation with the contract.

                                          SAFEGUARDING

5.1. Designation of On-Base Visitor Groups. The IC works in concert with the Air Force activity, CO
and ISPM to determine the designation of an on-base visitor group (cleared facility, integrated visitor
group or intermittent visitor).
5.1. (ACC) Designation of On-Base Visitor Groups. Contractors located on ACC installations will be
established as integrated visitor groups or intermittent visitors unless the Installation Commander deems
circumstances exist to identify the contractor operation as a cleared facility.

5.2. Integrated Visitor Group.
   5.2.1. Integrated visitor groups operate in accordance with DOD 5200.1-R and supplemental guid-
   ance thereto. They handle, generate, process, and store classified information per AF guidance. The
   exception being, their “access” is limited to “need-to-know” contract-specific classified performance
   information.
   5.2.2. The AF must stipulate the specific DOD 5200.1-R and supplemental guidance, which is appli-
   cable under the terms of the executed VGSA.
   5.2.3. The guidance conveyed to on-base contractor operation via the VGSA is limited to the AF
   installation and the AF solicitation/contract which it was executed to support. All other NISPOM
   mandated security requirements not addressed or specifically exempted by the executed VGSA or
   other contracting document must be implemented by the contractor.
   5.2.4. The VGSA must clearly reflect that the Air Force is accountable for and controls all classified
   information. Integrated contractor visitor groups are prohibited from establishing separate classified
   information controls. (NOTE: Integrated visitor group personnel can not be appointed as primary or
   alternate security managers for AF activities. However, they can be required (via the VGSA) to pro-
   vide other security program support, under AF direction, such as, conducting end-of-day security
   checks, security training/briefings, etc.).
   5.2.4. (ACC) Contractor personnel associated with Special Access Programs (SAPs) administered
   under DoD 5220.22-M Sup 1, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual Supplement,
   and AFI 16-701, Special Access Programs, may be nominated and approved by the cognizant Pro-
   gram Security Officer (HQ ACC/A8ZX) to fulfill the roles and responsibilities of security manager
   for the SAP.

5.3. Cleared Facility. An on-base cleared facility operates under the security mandates and requirements
of the NISPOM. See AFPD 31-6 for further guidance regarding their establishment.

5.4. Intermittent Visitors. Intermittent visitors may operate under the security requirements of the NIS-
POM or the installation security program. The IC makes this determination after considering the intermit-
tent visitor’s relationship and interface with the AF activity and/or installation.
5.4. (ACC) Intermittent Visitors. Intermittent visitors on ACC installations will operate under the secu-
rity requirements of the installation security program unless deemed otherwise by the Installation Com-
mander. An intermittent visitor’s presence on an installation usually does not exceed 90 consecutive days.

                                                Chapter 6

                OVERSIGHT REVIEWS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

6.1. Conducting Industrial Security Reviews (SRs).
   6.1.1. Industrial Security Reviews. The ISPM conduct security reviews (SRs) of on-base cleared
   facilities that performs classified work on Air Force installations. Such SRs evaluate the contractor’s
   compliance with contract specific-security requirements and pertinent DOD and Air Force security
   instructions.
   6.1.2. Scheduling Industrial Security Reviews. Conduct (SRs) of on-base cleared facilities per DOD
   5220.22-M and DOD 5220.22-R. Unless conducting an unannounced security review on a cleared
   facility, provide contractor activity’s management 30 days advanced written notification.
   6.1.3. Performing Industrial Security Reviews. ISPMs coordinate with other Air Force security dis-
   cipline OPRs such as; Operations Security (OPSEC), Computer Security (COMPUSEC) and Commu-
   nications Security (COMSEC), to provide specialized expertise when necessary to complete a
   security review. The SR is complete when all security requirements imposed under the terms of the
   contract have been evaluated.
      6.1.3.1. When SRs are conducted for cleared facilities, provide copies of completed SR report,
      with all related correspondence, to the CSO. Use DSS’ automated format to document the results
      of the SR. Contact HQ USAF/XOS-FI to obtain a copy of the automated DSS format.
      6.1.3.2. Facility security clearance (FCL) files must contain all key documentation prescribed by
      DOD 5220.22-R and the CSO, to include DD Form 254 and related contract security requirement
      documents.
   6.1.4. Post-Industrial Security Review Requirements.
      6.1.4.1. Send a letter/report to senior management officials of the cleared facility within 10 days
      of completing the security review. The letter should:
      6.1.4.2. Confirm the contractor's security status as discussed during the exit interview.
      6.1.4.3. List any deficiencies requiring corrective action.
      6.1.4.4. Within 30 days, request written confirmation on the status of any open major discrepancy
      (condition which resulted in or could reasonably be expected to result in the loss or compromise of
      classified information).
      6.1.4.5. The ISPM may extend the time for corrective action if required changes are significant
      and the contractor is making a conscientious effort to resolve problems expeditiously.
   6.1.5. Unsatisfactory Industrial Security Reviews.
      6.1.5.1. The ISPM assigns an on-base cleared facility an unsatisfactory SR rating:
          6.1.5.1.1. To a cleared facility visitor groups if it fails to satisfactorily perform its contractual
          security responsibilities.
          6.1.5.1.2. When major failures in the contractor's security program have resulted in or could
          reasonably be expected to result in the loss or compromise of classified information.
22                                                              AFI31-601_ACC_I 18 OCTOBER 2005


            6.1.5.1.3. When the contractor is clearly responsible for the security problems cited during a
            security review.
            6.1.5.1.4. The ISPM coordinates with the CSO and contracting officer when assigning an
            unsatisfactory SR rating for an on-base cleared facility.
            6.1.5.1.5. The home office facility (HOF) for the cleared facility is ultimately responsible for
            meeting contract security requirements. When assigning an unsatisfactory SR rating, the
            ISPM notifies the HOF immediately through the contracting office and requests prompt and
            complete corrective action. If the HOF fails to take corrective action, its security clearance
            may be affected. The servicing security activity should notify the HOF’s CSO if problems
            continue.
     6.1.6. Invalidating the Facility Security Clearance (FCL).
        6.1.6.1. The CSO notifies the contracting officers in writing when the FCL of a contractor under
        their jurisdiction is invalidated.
        6.1.6.2. A contractor who fails to correct security deficiencies that subsequently results in invali-
        dation may lose its FCL.
        6.1.6.3. Although most contractors resolve invalidations promptly, contractors with foreign
        owned, controlled, or influence (FOCI) invalidations may have to wait for many months. Where
        FOCI is evident, the facility clearance may remain invalidated for more than a year while methods
        to resolve the FOCI are considered, approved, and implemented. The FCL is invalidated while
        DSS negotiates voting trusts, proxy agreements, or special agreements with foreign interests.
        6.1.6.4. Document SR for an on-base cleared facility as required by the DOD 5220.22-M, DOD
        5220.22-R, and CSO guidance. Keep copies of completed SR reports with pre-security review let-
        ter and completed post-review correspondence for 2 years from the date of the most recent SR.
        6.1.6.5. Maintain copies of self-inspection reports or reviews for 2 years from date of the most
        recent self-inspection.

6.2. Conducting Information Security Program Reviews.
     6.2.1. Information Security Program Reviews. On-base integrated visitor groups will be evaluated
     and conduct self-inspections collectively with the AF activity per DOD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401,
     guidance. Integrated visitor groups will not be subjected to the SR requirements of the NISPOM. The
     installation prescribes the report for documenting program reviews.
     6.2.1. (ACC) Information Security Program Reviews. The ISPM will conduct an initial information
     security program review for all visitor groups. After the initial program review, visitor groups are
     checked as part of the sponsoring activities’ annual program review and semiannual security
     self-inspection program. Unit security managers ensure on-base visitor groups are included in their
     semiannual self-inspection program. The sponsoring activity Commander/Staff Agency Chief, secu-
     rity manager, and visitor group security focal point will be provided copies of program review reports.
     6.2.2. Scheduling Information Security Program Reviews. Schedule program reviews per DOD
     5200.1-R and AFI 31-401 guidance.
     6.2.3. The AF activity is responsible for ensuring its integrated visitor group implement and comply
     with DOD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401 requirements.
AFI31-601_ACC_I 18 OCTOBER 2005                                                                      23


  6.2.4. The ISPM, unit security manager and integrated visitor group establishes files and maintain the
  following documentation, as appropriate:
     6.2.4.1. Signed copy of the DD Form 254 and any revisions.
     6.2.4.2. Signed copy of the VGSA. (NOTE: Maintaining a copy of the VGSA is optional for the
     ISPM).
     6.2.4.2. (ACC) ISPMs will maintain the original VGSA for each integrated visitor group.
     6.2.4.3. Current listing of the key on-base management officials or representatives.
     6.2.4.4. Copy of the last annual program review.
     6.2.4.5. Copies of last two self-inspections reports. The annual program review can be used to
     substitute for one of the self-inspections. (NOTE: The maintenance of self-inspection reports is
     optional for ISPMs).
     6.2.4.6. DELETED.
  6.2.5. For visitor groups, the ISPM briefs key Air Force and designated visitor group managers on the
  status of the unit’s security program. Provide both parties a copy of the PR report and any other
  related assessment, survey or staff assistance visit (SAV) report. Do not furnish copies of these
  reports to the CSO.
     6.2.5.1. When warranted, AF commanders notify the contractor’s home office facility (HOF), in
     writing, through the contracting office of major security program deficiencies or non-compliance
     with the terms of the VGSA.
  6.2.6. The ISPM will maintain files/records on each on-base integrated visitor group in accordance
  with paragraph 6.2.4., this publication.

                                       VISITS AND MEETINGS

7.1. Installation Visitors. The installation commander is the sole authority responsible for granting con-
tractors access to the installation, regardless of which DOD agency, military service component, or activ-
ity awarded the contract.

7.2. Visitor Groups. The IC designates contractors who require access to the installation in the perfor-
mance of a government contract as intermittent visitors, integrated visitor groups, or cleared facilities.
7.2. (ACC) Visitor Groups. Contractors located on ACC installations will be established as integrated
visitor groups or intermittent visitors unless the Installation Commander deems circumstances exist to
identify the contractor operation as a cleared facility.

7.3. Contractor Visits to Air Force Installations.
     7.3.1. DOD contractors located on or visiting Air Force installations in support of a classified con-
     tract must comply with DOD 5220.22-M, Chapter 6, Section 1, visit requirements.
     7.3.1. (ACC) JPAS will be used to verify the personnel security clearance level for contractors
     located on or visiting DoD activities. Security managers will maintain a hard copy Joint Clearance and
     Access Verification System (JCAVS) Person Summary for each contractor assigned to their organiza-
     tion until contract performance ends. Visit Authorization Letters (VALs) will be used when contractor
     personnel security information is not located in, or accurately reflected in JCAVS. Security managers
     will maintain a copy of the VAL until contract performance ends.
        7.3.1.1. (Added-ACC) Security managers will in-process each visitor group employee into their
        organization as “servicing” in JCAVS to ensure they receive information regarding clearance eli-
        gibility and access.
     7.3.2. DELETED.

                                        SUBCONTRACTING

8.1. Prime Contractor’s Responsibilities.
   8.1.1. Prime contractors are responsible for ensuring their on-base subcontractors are knowledgeable
   of and comply with the applicable security requirements (NISPOM, installation, etc.) as identified in
   contracts and/or other contracting documents.
   8.1.2. Prime contractors supporting classified efforts must include a provision in each on-base sub-
   contract that requires subcontractors to contact the installation commander or designee and execute a
   VGSA prior to beginning on-base operations.

8.2. Subcontractor Responsibilities. On-base subcontractors must execute a separate and/or indepen-
dent VGSA with the installation. (NOTE: As an alternative, when multiple subcontractor perform ser-
vices in support of the same on-base classified contract and prime contractor, the execution of this VGSA,
can be satisfied by the subcontractor acknowledging review and understanding of the security require-
ments identified in the prime contractor’s executed VGSA. This being the case, executing and adding a
signatory page only (attachment) to the prime’s VGSA is acceptable).

Terms
Classified Contract—Any contract that requires or will require access to classified information by the
contractor or the employees in the performance of the contract. A contract may be classified even though
the contract document itself is not classified.
Cleared Facility—A non-government owned and operated industrial, educational, commercial, or other
facility for which DOD has made an administrative determination (from a security viewpoint) that the
entity is eligible for and requires access to classified information of a certain category (Confidential,
Secret, or Top Secret).
Cognizant Security Office—The designated Department of Defense (DOD) agency responsible for
industrial security program administration. The Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) has designated the
Defense Security Service (DSS) to perform this function. The Director of DSS has further delegated this
responsibility downward within the agency. DSS Regional Directors provide industrial security
administration for DOD contractor facilities located within their respective geographical area. One
exception, for which ISPM has responsible, is DOD contractors on Air Force installation who have been
designated as “visitor groups.” When used, the language “Cognizant Security Office” (CSO), always
refers to DSS or an entity thereof.
Information Security Program Manager (ISPM)—This AF entity implements and administers the
installation’s information, personnel and industrial security programs. The ISPM is responsible for
supervising and overseeing on-base contractor’s security programs and/or operations.
Installation—An installation is an area in which the Air Force holds a real property interest or real
property over which the Air Force has jurdisdiction by agreement with a foreign government or by right
of occupation. The term installation also includes all auxiliary off-base or detached installations under the
jurisdiction of the commander of the primary installation.
Integrated Visitor Groups—An on-base contractor operation, cleared per the NISP or ISR, that requires
access to classified information and operates under the direct control/supervision of the Air Force. The
integrated visitor group is authorized to function in accordance with DOD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401 per
the VGSA. The Air Force maintains control of all classified and provides day-to-day supervision over
this type of contractor operation. It basically differs from the on-base cleared facility because of its close
interaction and/or relationship with the AF organization it supports.
Interim Facility Security Clearances (Interim FCL)—Interim FCL are temporary, limited company
security clearances established by the DSS. It does not permit access to Restricted Data, COMSEC,
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), SCI, SAP, or Arms Control and Disarmament Agency
classified Information. However, if an interim Top Secret FCL is issued, the contractor may access such
information at the level of Secret and Confidential. Interim FCLs may not be appropriate for all
contractual needs and are not available for all sponsored companies.
Intermittent Visitor—A contractor or company, cleared per the NISP or ISR, that require “entry” to an
Air Force installation for brief periods of time on a scheduled or on call basis to perform contractual
duties. An intermittent visitor’s presence on an installation usually does not exceed 90 consecutive days.
Invalidation—A condition at a cleared facility caused by changed conditions or performance under
which the facility may no longer be eligible for an FCL unless the facility promptly initiates appropriate
corrective actions.
AFI31-601_ACC_I 18 OCTOBER 2005                                                                        33


Major Discrepancy—A condition, which resulted in or could reasonably be, expected to result in the
loss or compromise of classified information.
On-Base Cleared Facility—An on-base contractor operation cleared under the provisions of the NISP
and established at the discretion of the IC per DOD 5220.22-R. These entities operate under NISPOM
guidance and the ISPM has been designated by the IC to provide security oversight.
Reciprocity—A reciprocal condition, relationship, mutual or cooperative agreement, between two or
more agencies, components, or departments agreeing to recognize and accept the efforts (requirements,
procedures, actions, etc.) of the other in exchange for the same compensation.
Visitor Group—Any on-base contractor operation, cleared per the NISP or ISR, that requires access to
classified information. The installation commander determines their “official” on-base designation.
(NOTE: All on-base contractor operations are considered “visitor groups,” per this AFI. The IC assesses
and evaluates the working relationship and interactions between the visitor group and AF activity to
determining their “official” designation, i.e., cleared facility, integrated visitor group or intermittent
visitor).
Visitor Group Security Agreement—A documented and legally binding contractual agreement
between an Air Force activity and a DOD contractor whereby the contractor commits to complying with,
rendering or performing specific security tasks or functions for compensation. The VGSA attest to and
certifies the existence of such an agreement, including applicable changes and amendments, attachments,
supplements and exhibits.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision incorporates Interim Change 2005-1 and aligns this guidance with the revised Air Force Pol-
icy Directive (AFPD) 31-6, Industrial Security. Revisions include renumbering the chapters; updating
office symbols and publication references; requiring the identification of government information and
sensitive resources that require protection in classified contract documents; mandating the integration of
on-base contractor operations into the installation information security program per AFPD 31-6; requiring
the execution of a security agreement with contractors that perform contractual services on Air Force
installations and require access to classified and gives installation commanders the discretionary authority
to also require the execution of an security agreement with on-base contractors that require access to sen-
sitive unclassified information or frequent "entry" to the installation; clarifying responsibilities and proce-
dures for processing National Interest Determinations (NIDs); requiring a review of the DD Form 254,
Contract Security Classification Specification, at two year intervals; requiring subcontractors that per-
form contractual services on Air Force installations to execute a Visitors Group Security Agreement
(VGSA) when execution is required per this instruction; requiring contractors that use government infor-
mation technology (IT) and automated information systems (AISs) to undergo a background investigation
prior to IT usage; and eliminating the requirement to use the DD Form 696, Industrial Security Inspection
Report. (NOTE: As used in this publication, the term “security review” is not synonymous nor does it
negate the “security and policy review” requirement of AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Proce-
dures. The term "sensitive unclassified information" refers to information identified in a classified con-
tract that has been marked "For Official Use Only (FOUO)" per DOD 5200.1-R, Information Security
Program, and is exempt from release under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)). A bar ( | ) indicates

tains all FCLs within the NISP. Also see DOD 5220.22-M, DOD 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program,
AFPD 31-5, Personnel Security, and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management.
2.1.1.3. Establishing final FCLs through DSS may take several months. When circumstances do not per-
mit such delays, sponsors may request an interim FCL through DSS.
2.1.2. Sponsoring Interim FCLs. DSS automatically processes all requests for Confidential and Secret
FCLs for interim clearances when possible. However, Air Force sponsorship of interim Top Secret FCLs

must be justified on a case-specific basis in accordance with DOD 5220.22-R. To request a Top Secret
interim FCL, the CO prepares and routes sponsorships through command channels to the MAJCOM,
FOA, or DRU commander for approval. Each request must include these items:
2.1.3. Establishing FCLs. DSS establishes and maintains FCL for contractor operations participating in
the NISP.
2.2.3.2.2. Forward request for non-SAP NID through command ISPM channels to HQ USAF/XOS-FI for
review and coordination. The NIDs are then be forwarded to SAF/AAZ for review and endorsement.
2.2.3.3. SAF/AA endorse the NID and forwards it to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for
Counterintelligence and Security (OSD-USD/I), 5000 Defense Pentagon, Washington, D.C. 20301-3040,
for final approval.
2.3.1. The Defense Security Service grants and maintains contractor PCLs. DSS also terminates contrac-
tor PCLs when the contractor no longer needs them or when a contractor employee is terminated. Admin-
istrative termination of a PCL carries no adverse implications regarding the employee or the contractor.
2.3.4.4. The CO sends favorably endorsed requests to the contractor, who then includes the endorsement
in the personnel security questionnaire package for transmission to DSS for action. The CO promptly
returns denied requests.
4.2.1. The AF program, project or activity prepares a draft DD Form 254 for each classified contract.
When drafting the DD Form 254s, the program, project or activity will consult with the CO, ISPM and
other installation security discipline or functional OPRs affected under the terms of the solicitation/con-
tract to ensure accuracy. Once drafted, the draft DD Form 254 is forwarded to the CO for processing. The
contractor should use the security classification/declassification specifications and other contractual secu-
rity requirements listed in the DD Form 254 to accurately estimate the cost of security.
4.2.2. The CO reviews and coordinates the draft DD Form 254 with all affected security disciplines and
functionals, as appropriate. This action ensures that approved security guidance is being provided to the
contractor. Once the review has been completed, the requesting AF entity/activity incorporates the neces-
sary changes and prepares and forwards an original DD Form 254 to the CO for subsequent approval and
signing.
4.2.3. Prior to signing the original DD Form 254, the CO will verify that all affected security disciplines
and/or functional OPRs have reviewed and coordinated on the draft DD Form 254. This review and coor-
dination action will be recorded/annotated in Block 13 (office symbol, date and initial’s of reviewer) of
the draft DD Form 254. The CO will file and maintain a copy of the annotated draft DD Form 254 in the
respective contract file. When SAPs are involved, coordinate draft and original DD Form 254 with the
office responsible for SAP security oversight. Keep DD Form 254 for collateral programs and SAPs
unclassified, whenever possible.
4.3.1. The ISPM reviews the draft and original DD Form 254 to ensure that the security classification
guidance is accurate, approved and appropriate. However, the ISPM only annotates Block 13 of the draft
DD Form 254. Other security requirements are incorporated into the SOW, SOO, PWS, VGSA, etc.
4.3.2. The AF program, project or activity reviews the DD Form 254 and applicable security classifica-
tion/declassification guidance at least once every five years or as required, to ensure accuracy and cur-
rency. When changes are necessary, the contract will be modified, if appropriate and revised guidance
issued.

TEM (AIS) SECURITY
9.1. Information Technology and Automated Information System Accreditation.
9.1.1. When industrial security program oversight is retained by the Air Force for on-base cleared facili-
ties, the CO coordinates information technology (IT)/ automated information system (AIS) accreditation,
Communications Security (COMSEC), and Emission Security (EMSEC) requirements with the responsi-
ble installation security discipline OPR, the ISPM and DSS, if appropriate.
9.1.2. Integrated visitor groups use approved Air Force IT/AIS and/or networks to process classified and
sensitive unclassified information.
9.1.3. Contractor employees who require access to government IT/AIS under the terms of a government
contract must be determined to be trustworthy by a designated government official prior to IT/AIS access
being granted. Process all contractors IT/AIS access security background investigations in accordance
with DOD 5200.2-R and AFI 31-501. This requirement must be specified in the basic solicitation and/or
contract documents.
9.1.4. Contracts or solicitations (classified and unclassified) involving the use, operation, maintenance,
etc., of IT/AIS will be routed through the installation Communications and Information (SC) activity for

Program Protection, Information Technology, etc.), procedures, operating instructions (OIs), and educa-
tional/training materials that meet the intent of and satisfy NISPOM requirements. Coordinate with other
security discipline OPRs, when applicable, and incorporate authority for their usage in the VGSA or other
appropriate contracting documents.
