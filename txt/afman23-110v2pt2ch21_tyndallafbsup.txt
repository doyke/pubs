SUMMARY OF CHANGES

The summary of change includes changes in the standard base tracking system for processing
hazardous waste transactions, who will identify to Hazardous Materials (HAZMO), and who the
point of contact is for both small arm serial reports and COMSEC serial number reports and data.
21.144.1. SBSS will not be used as the standard base tracking system for processing hazardous
waste transactions. The Civil Engineering Squadron is administratively and operationally
accountable for hazardous waste. Items received damaged will be returned to the manufacturer
when possible. If the item cannot be returned, it will be turned into 325 CES/CEV, building
6011 for appropriate disposal. Items that are excess with no demand level and items that are
shelf-life expired must go through the free issue program. At the beginning of each month,
Supply will identify to Hazardous Materials Office (HAZMO) those items that will expire at the
end of the month. HAZMO will advertise stock availability and identify free issue candidates.
At the end of the month, the expired shelf-life material will be condemned and transferred to the
"free issue" requestor. Any remaining material will be screened by DRMO for potential market
resale value. If DRMO advises items have no market resale value, they will be transferred to
325 CES/CEV, building 6011 for appropriate disposal. NOTE: Hazardous materials will not be
accepted by 325 CES/CEV at building 6011 until the above conditions are met.
