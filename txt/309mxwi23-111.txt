1. General Information. This is a new instruction and must be completely reviewed and
complied with. The procedures to move end item (EIs) from on-work-order (OWO) status to
AWP storage, and back to in-work (INW) status when the EI becomes fully parts supportable
(FWP) have been revised. This instruction addresses the various legs of the DIOH INT balances
with the INW/OWO balances in the Wholesale and Retail Receiving and Shipping System
(WARRS/D035K), Job Order Production Master System (JOPMS/G004L), and the
Exchangeable Production System (EPS/G402A). It also addresses DIOH transaction errors
between systems, along with providing guidance for the AWP process and AWP cannibalization
actions.
   1.1. The PSS/PST must ensure the necessary transactions are processed in the scheduling
   systems correctly for the EI data to overlay to Automated Bill of Material (ABOM),
   G337/Inventory Tracking System (G337/ITS), and Maintenance Business System
   Modernization (MABSM)/Impresa.
   1.2. Systems. EIs are managed using multiple maintenance information system (MISs) and
   tools. The PSS/PST must ensure necessary transactions are processed correctly in the
   appropriate MIS to overlay in a timely manner. Systems used include, but not limited to:
       1.2.1. WARRS/D035K is utilized for the management of the AWP process. This
       includes management of DIOH, EIs in INT to and from maintenance, EIs in INW status,
       AWP-G (awaiting parts), AWP-F (fully parts supportable) condition, misidentified, and
       NTI (not turned-in) in WARRS/D035K only, and management of component parts linked
       to the EI and AWP reporting (see WARRS/D035K DIOH Status Codes Attachment 2).
       However, to order parts the PSS/PST will use ABOM and the shop personnel will use the
       Material Processing System (MPS/D230) if applicable.
          1.2.1.1. WARRS/D035K tracks unserviceable (repairable) EIs issued to maintenance
          using a document identifier code (DIC) of D7M, and completes the tracking process
          when the EI is turned in with a DIC of D6M with the same document number (DN)
          the EI was issued on. Refer to AFMAN 23-110, Volume III, Part Two, Chapter 21,
          Attachment 21A-16 for DICs used by WARRS/D035K. If the request is not
          formatted correctly, then this transaction will error out in WARRS/D035K.
       1.2.2. EPS/G402A allows the PSS/PST to manually order unserviceable (repairable) EIs,
       turn-in EIs, and perform adjustments that affect the DIOH master record balances in
       WARRS/D035K and other MIS.
 4                                                              309MXWI23-111 6 JUNE 2012


        1.2.3. MABSM/Impresa and the G337/ITS provide the capability to induct EIs into
        shops, and also track them and their routes or sub-assemblies through the MRO
        processes.
        1.2.4. ABOM and Naval Industrial Material Management System (NIMMS) are used to
        order and track component parts required for EIs going through the repair process.
        1.2.5. MPS/D230 may be utilized by technicians or mechanics to notify the PSS/PST
        when a component part is required.
        1.2.6. Defense Industrial Financial Management System (DIFMS) provides funds control
        accounting for budget execution and management information.
2. Inducting an EI into the Shop. If an item is Execution and Prioritization of Repairs Support
System (EXPRESS/D087X) driven, the requirement will pass to the WARRS/D035K express
table. If there are no EIs currently in FWP status in the AWP storage area of the maintenance
inventory center (MIC), the request will pass automatically to supply for an unserviceable EI to
be issued from the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) warehouse. If the item is a Non-
EXPRESS/D087X driven item, the PSS/PST will manually order the EI through EPS/G402A.
The PSS/PST will perform all the functions outlined in paragraph 2.1 thru paragraph 2.2.9.1
     2.1. G337/ITS user will:
        2.1.1. Once the EI is received in the shop, physically verify that the item received is the
        correct item by matching the national stock number (NSN) on the shipping document
        Department of Defense Form (DD Form) 1348-1A, Issue Release Receipt Document, to
        the item received.
            2.1.1.1. If the incorrect item is received, reference procedures outlined in AFMCI 21-
            156, Chapter 3.
        2.1.2. Clear the receipt acknowledgement (RA) suspense in G337/ITS as follows:
            2.1.2.1. Use the 2025 Selective Induction screen (Attachment 3, Figures A3.1 and
            A3.2) or 2078 Multiple Inductions screen (Attachment 4, Figure A4.1). NOTE:
            This transaction is the first leg in the DIOH process and passes the EI induction
            information to WARRS/D035K, EPS/G402A, JOPMS/G004L and DIFMS. Update
            these systems to document that the EI was received by maintenance and is now INW
            status in WARRS/D035K, and in OWO status in EPS/G402A, JOPMS/G004L and
            DIFMS.
               2.1.2.1.1. The 2025 screen inducts the master and lets the shop induct the routes
               or children work controlled document (WCDs) as required.
               2.1.2.1.2. The 2078 screen inducts the master and all routes or children WCDs.
               If routes are accomplished 100 percent of the time, then the 2078 screen should be
               used.
        2.1.3. After the RA suspense has been cleared, write the inventory tracking number
        (ITN) on the DD Form 1348-1A for use in paragraph 2.1.8 The ITN is visible in the
        upper portion of the 2025 screen, and can also be viewed on the 2080 Production Number
        (PDN) Induction Review screen (Attachment 4, Figure A4.2).
309MXWI23-111 6 JUNE 2012                                                                       5


     2.1.4. Access the 2037 WCD Print screen (Attachment 5, Figure A5.1) to print the
     WCD.
     2.1.5. Open Time and Attendance (TAA) (Attachment 5, Figure A5.2) and scan the
     first operation.
     2.1.6. Stamp and date the first operation on the WCD.
     2.1.7. Attach the WCD to the corresponding EI needing repair by end item document
     number (EIDN).
     2.1.8. Log the induction information onto the AFMC Form 105, Workload Record, or
     AFMC Form 130, Production Asset Control Record.
        2.1.8.1. This will be used to aid in researching and correcting DIOH errors
        identification between EPS/G402A, JOPMS/G004L and WARRS/D035K. The
        information on the AFMC Form 105 or AFMC Form 130 also provides an auditable
        progressive inventory record of EIs processed through the repair shops.
  2.2. MABSM/Impresa user will:
     2.2.1. Once the EI is received in the shop, physically verify that the item received is the
     correct item by matching the NSN on the shipping document DD Form 1348-1A to the
     item received.
        2.2.1.1. If the incorrect item is received, reference procedures outlined in AFMCI 21-
        156, Chapter 3.
     2.2.2. Clear the RA suspense in MABSM/Impresa as follows:
        2.2.2.1. Access the Sales Orders w/ITS Induction (OEOEH) screen (Attachment 6,
        Figure A6.1) and process the induction of the EI. NOTE: This transaction is the
        first leg in the DIOH process and passes the EI induction information to
        WARRS/D035K, EPS/G402A, JOPMS/G004L and DIFMS; updates these systems to
        document that the EI was received by maintenance and is now INW status in
        WARRS/D035K, and in OWO status in EPS/G402A, JOPMS/G004L and DIFMS.
            2.2.2.1.1. This transaction will overlay and interface with EPS/G402A,
            JOPMS/G004L, WARRS/D035K and DIFMS.
        2.2.2.2. The line number is color coded on the OEOEH screen.
            2.2.2.2.1. If the overlay is successful; a green line number will appear.
            2.2.2.2.2. If the overlay is unsuccessful; a red line number will appear.
                2.2.2.2.2.1. If the transaction is unsuccessful, scroll to the error flag field to
                determine the cause of the error. Once the error has been corrected, click the
                release tandem (Rel Tandem) button and the transaction will be successful; a
                green line number will appear.
            2.2.2.2.3. If the overlay is processing; a yellow line number will appear.
            2.2.2.2.4. If the work order (WO) has been released; a blue line number will
            appear.
            2.2.2.2.5. If the WO has been closed; a grey line number will appear.
6                                                              309MXWI23-111 6 JUNE 2012


       2.2.3. Once the RA suspense has been successfully cleared, a WO number will be able to
       populate.
           2.2.3.1. Highlight the complete line number of the item needing a WO populated in
           the OEOEH screen.
           2.2.3.2. Press the release WO button and a WO will populate for the line number.
           2.2.3.3. Write this WO number on the DD Form 1348-1A as it will be used in future
           screens to complete the induction process.
       2.2.4. Print the assembly WCD by using the Shop Paper Print Flag (WOPF) screen to
       identify which WO to print. When saved this will automatically open the Shop Paper
       Print (WOPSH) screen (Attachment 6, Figure A6.2) to print the WCD to a printer.
       2.2.5. Release the routes or children for this document on the Repair Survey Action
       Approval (RORL) screen as needed, or request by the repair shop.
           2.2.5.1. The RORL screen is used only for those EIs having routes or children.
       2.2.6. Open TAA and scan the first operation.
       2.2.7. Stamp and date the first operation on the WCD.
       2.2.8. Attach the WCD to the corresponding EI needing repair by EIDN.
       2.2.9. Log the induction information onto the AFMC Form 105 or AFMC Form 130.
           2.2.9.1. This will be used to aid in researching and correcting DIOH errors
           identification between EPS/G402A, JOPMS/G004L and WARRS/D035K. The
           information on the AFMC Form 105 or AFMC Form 130 also provides an auditable
           progressive inventory record of EIs processed through the repair shops.
3. DIOH.
    3.1. DIOH General Information. DIOH is the term used by the depots when describing
    depot- level maintenance of an EI that requires major overhaul, modification or repair of
    certain parts. The unserviceable or unmodified EI is shipped to the maintenance shop for
    repair, then returned in serviceable or modified condition.
    3.2. Systems used to track EIs being repaired. There are five data systems that interface or
    account for EIs being overhauled or modified. In order for the transaction to process through
    all five systems, both the issue and the turn-in must contain the same EIDN.
       3.2.1. The WARRS/D035K issues the EI to the shops for repair, creates INTs, and
       maintains the in maintenance M balances. NOTE: The M balance in WARRS/D035K is
       a total of OWO, AWP and awaiting maintenance (AWM) balances on all control
       numbers for that NSN.
       3.2.2. The EPS/G402A allows the PSS/PST to order EIs, return EIs to supply, and to
       perform adjustments that affect the DIOH record balances of the JOPMS/G004L or
       WARRS/D035K.
       3.2.3. The G337/ITS and MABSM/Impresa are on-line computer systems that provide
       the capability to plan the processing of depot maintenance workloads, induct EIs into the
309MXWI23-111 6 JUNE 2012                                                                         7


     maintenance shops, and track the EIs and their sub-assemblies and components through
     the disassembly, repair and assembly process.
  3.3. Scheduling items for repair. There are two ways that EIs are issued to the repair shops.
     3.3.1. The EXPRESS/D087X system automatically prioritizes worldwide repair
     requirements. It passes the requirements to the WARRS/D035K and the EI is issued to
     the repair shop.
     3.3.2. If the EI is not part of the EXPRESS/D087X process, then the scheduler must
     request the EI through the EPS/G402A. The EPS/G402A will overlay the request to
     WARRS/D035K and the EI will be issued to the repair shop.
  3.4. Reports schedulers use to track EIs being repaired. NOTE: For further information on
  more reports, policies and procedures on DIOH refer to AFMAN 23-110, Volume II, Part
  Two, Chapter 6 and AFMCI 21-156, Chapter 3.
     3.4.1. The daily EI production account visibility and cross-reference list
     (JOPMS/G004L-L2A) provides visibility of balances in the JOPMS/G004L on a daily
     basis.
     3.4.2. The DIOH in maintenance out-of-balance records (JOPMS/G004L-W5C) listing
     that is produced weekly by the production section scheduling designator (PSSD). This
     report identifies those NSNs and associated job order number (JONs) that are out of
     balance.
     3.4.3. The erroneous production transactions by PSSD (JOPMS/G004L-W5D) report
     that identifies production transactions that are rejected in the JOPMS/G004L, and lists the
     code indicating the reason for the reject.
     3.4.4. The maintenance production history (JOPMS/G004L-W3B) provides all the
     transactions for the current week, plus the same rejects described above by NSN. The
     product could prove useful in determining whether or not a reject has been corrected.
  3.5. DIOH Policy.
     3.5.1. Accountability of DIOH records. The DIOH record balances are important
     planning tools for the material managers. They use this information to determine how
     many unserviceable assets are being repaired by maintenance. This in turn allows them
     to ascertain the number of serviceable assets that will be available for shipment to a user
     of the item. In addition, the EXPRESS/D087X looks at asset posture in order to
     prioritize worldwide requirements and produce a consolidated repair list. NOTE:
     Because INT and DIOH INW or OWO balance are included in the assessment, it is
     imperative that erroneous or outstanding INT details and JOPMS/G004L and
     WARRS/D035K out-of-balances are worked in a timely manner.
     3.5.2. Responsibility for maintaining accountability of DIOH records is the DLA
     material support specialist (MSS). The DLA MSS and the PSS/PST will perform a joint
     reconciliation to resolve differences between JOPMS/G004L and WARRS/D035K.
     3.5.3. One per induction edit. The WARRS/D035K, EPS/G402A, G337/ITS and
     MABSM/Impresa systems were modified to edit against quantities in D7M transactions.
     To facilitate the management of EIs in repair, all items driven into the repair shops will
8                                                               309MXWI23-111 6 JUNE 2012


       be done in quantities of one unless specifically authorized or warranted by the type of
       workload, and if the EI does not require AWP parts tracking.
       3.5.4. Systems used to make DIOH corrections. The DLA MSS will process DIOH
       corrections through the WARR/D035K and the PSS/PST will use the EPS/G402A for
       corrections to JOPMS/G004L.
    3.6. EI issue process. WARRS/D035K issues unserviceable reparable items to maintenance.
       3.6.1. When an EI is issued, WARRS/D035K creates an INT to maintenance. This INT
       is awaiting a reply back from the EPS/G402A that indicates the EI was received. NOTE:
       Although the transaction has the RA in the advice code, it has not cleared until there is a
       clear (CL) in the action suffix column. Wash post (WP) issue transactions with a WP
       action suffix will not create an INT balance in the WARRS/D035K, but will only pick up
       an M balance. D7 transactions with an action suffix of PK adjusts JOPMS/G004L
       balances only. If the quantity of the RA is greater than the quantity of the INT balance,
       the transaction will be rejected to the input remote station with a WW advice code. The
       quantity will be the total transaction quantity. The DLA MSS must perform research to
       ensure the transaction took in WARRS/D035K Review Transaction History (RINA)
       screen.
    3.7. EI turn-in process. When maintenance repairs the EI, a turn-in is processed through
    EPS/G402A and passes to WARRS/D035K. It will take one off the M balance and create an
    INT to supply in WARRS/D305K.
       3.7.1. When the EI is received in the central receiving part of the DLA warehouse, the
       transaction will be acknowledged by processing the transaction with a RT advice code in
       WARRS/D035K. NOTE: WP issue transactions with a WP action suffix will create an
       INT balance in WARRS/D035K, but will only take off an M balance. D6 transactions
       with an action suffix of PK adjust the JOPMS/G004L balances only. Input of RT in
       WARRS/D035K does not produce any output back to the EPS/G402A that RT has been
       completed. Therefore, the EI history screen in EPS/G402A will show the same
       regardless of whether the second leg RT has been processed in WARRS/D035K or not.
    3.8. PSS/PST DIOH responsibilities.
       3.8.1. Overages. When production items are received by depot maintenance that are
       greater than the quantity requested, the PSS/PST will request that DLA MSS return the
       assets. They will attach a copy of the issue document and annotate the overage quantity
       being returned.
       3.8.2. Partial shortages. If the quantity received is short, the PSS/PST will contact the
       DLA MSS and ask that a physical search for the material be accomplished.
           3.8.2.1. If the material is located, the PSS/PST will request delivery of the material.
           When received, the RA will be processed as normal.
           3.8.2.2. If the material cannot be located, the PSS/PST will contact the DLA MSS.
       3.8.3. Misidentified items back to supply. The PSS/PST will:
           3.8.3.1. Prepare a turn-in for the actual NSN received in EPS/G402A.
              3.8.3.1.1. The control number will be all zeros with the original job designator.
309MXWI23-111 6 JUNE 2012                                                                   9


            3.8.3.1.2. A cost code of V will be used.
            3.8.3.1.3. Action suffix code will be PB which prevents a DIOH adjustment. It
            will post as an M balance.
            3.8.3.1.4. Input a DF1 transaction for the original control number, job designator
            and EIDN in EPS/G402A to correct the M balance on the requested NSN in
            WARRS/D035K.
     3.8.4. Misidentified items to be retained by maintenance. The material must be
     transferred to a different control number and job designator if not used on the same
     workload. The PSS/PST will:
        3.8.4.1. Process a DF1 transaction on the original control number, job designator and
        EIDN in EPS/G402A. This will take off an M balance on the requested NSN in
        WARRS/D035K.
        3.8.4.2. Process an EI induction with a WP action suffix on the correct control
        number, job designator for the NSN received in G337/ITS or MABSM/Impresa. This
        will add an M balance in WARRS/D035K.
     3.8.5. DIOH in maintenance out-of-balance records.
        3.8.5.1. Possible causes of out-of-balance conditions between WARRS/D035K and
        JOPMS/G004L.
            3.8.5.1.1. When a transaction posts to WARR/D035K, but JOPMS/G004L rejects
            it (for reject codes applicable to DIOH, see AFMCI 21-156).
            3.8.5.1.2. When a transaction posts to JOPMS/G004L, but WARRS/D035K
            rejects it.
            3.8.5.1.3. When the PSS/PST processes a PK action suffix reversal on a
            transaction in EPS/G402A that should have been reversed in WARRS/D035K.
            3.8.5.1.4. When the PSS/PST uses the wrong control number on a D7 or D6
            transaction.
            3.8.5.1.5. Quantity and or condition errors on the D6 T or D7M RA.
            3.8.5.1.6. Data entry errors.
            3.8.5.1.7. When the PSS/PST uses PK actions to update or correct
            JOPMS/G004L, and doesn’t contact the DLA MSS to input the correct
            transactions to update WARRS/D035K.
     3.8.6. How to reconcile DIOH in maintenance out-of-balance conditions.
        3.8.6.1. The PSS/PST needs to contact the DLA MSS to determine how many assets
        are showing in WARRS/D035K; compare to the total of OWO, AWP and AWM in
        JOPMS/G004L on the EI NSN and what is physically in the shop.
        3.8.6.2. If WARRS/D035K is correct, the PSS/PST needs to correct the
        JOPMS/G004L.
            3.8.6.2.1. The PSS/PST needs to check the JOPMS/G004L-W5D report to see if
            any transactions could have caused the out-of-balance. If a transaction is found,
 10                                                            309MXWI23-111 6 JUNE 2012


              coordinate with the DLA MSS to ensure appropriate corrective transaction is
              taken.
          3.8.6.3. The use of a PK action suffix code on production transactions will adjust the
          JOPMS/G004L only.
              3.8.6.3.1. If the JOPMS/G004L is correct, contact the DLA MSS to research the
              RINA transaction history screen in WARRS/D035K to determine if any of the
              transactions listed above have processed that adjusted in one system only.
4. Requesting and Ordering Component Parts for EI Repair. The maintenance technician or
mechanic will inform the PSS/PST when a component part is required by using either a pick list,
AFMC IMT 95, Issue Request, MPS/D230, purchase order system in MABSM/Impresa, ABOM,
or a MIS locally developed pick list or spreadsheet.
   4.1. The maintenance technician or mechanic will provide to the PSS/PST the following
   information when requesting material: control number, JON, resource control center (RCC),
   required delivery date (RDD), standard reporting designator (SRD), operation number,
   quantity, unit of issue, NSN, part number (P/N) (if applicable), technical order (TO), figure
   and index if applicable, and the technicians or mechanics name on the request form. NOTE:
   The SRD should be provided by the mechanic. The planner should also have a list of SRDs.
   SRD codes can be found in field TOs. The RDD is the date the part is needed to complete
   the repair on schedule. Backorders are assigned a 6N advice code and a project code of
   AWP.
   4.2. The PSS/PST will order parts using the single order or pick list function screen in
   ABOM for consumable items. When using the pick list function the priority code defaults to
   C3. It is imperative that the PSS/PST changes the priority to B3 or higher so the backorder
   can link to the EI. For exchange items the PSS/PST will order in the ABOM Exchangeable
   Module.
   4.3. When the order is placed include the EIDN, SRD, RDD and priority. Priority must be a
   B3 or higher for a backorder to link to the EI, which will allow the EI to be put into formal
   AWP if required.
   4.4. If the item is not readily available, the PSS/PST will look for possible substitution NSNs
   or ask the maintenance technician or mechanic to check the TO or blue print for alternate
   P/Ns and to validate the source maintenance reparability (SMR) code.
5. Ordering Non-Stock Listed (NSL) Items for EI Repair. If a requested component P/N
does not convert to a NSN, the PSS/PST will submit a DD Form 1348-6, Purchase Request
Actions, through the Part Number Supply Support Request System (PNSSRS) database for the
item. For further guidance on ordering NSL items, refer to 309 MXW Instruction (MXWI) 23-
106, Non-Stock Listed Requests.
6. Moving the EI from OWO to AWP Storage. Once it is determined that the backordered
component parts will not be available by the RDD, the production shop supervisor or designated
representative and the PSS/PST will:
   6.1. Make the decision to have the EI taken off of OWO and put in AWP storage.
       6.1.1. Input a delay code of R05 or R06 in the G337/ITS or TAA system.
       MABSM/Impresa users do not use the R05 or R06 code in TAA. NOTE: Refer to
309MXWI23-111 6 JUNE 2012                                                                      11


       AFMAN 23-110 Volume III, Part Two, Chapter 6, and AFMCI 21-156, Chapter 3 for
       further guidance.
   6.2. The PSS/PST will perform all functions from paragraph 6.2.1 thru paragraph 6.16
       6.2.1. Gather all WCDs from the repair shop for the EI going into AWP.
       6.2.2. Coordinate with shop supervisor or designated representative to ensure the EI has
       been completely inspected, and all replacement parts for reassembly have been identified
       and ordered prior to placing the EI in AWP.
6.2.3. Will coordinate with shop supervisor or designated representative to ensure EIs placed in
AWP storage are clean and completely free of any fluids.
6.2.4. Will coordinate with shop supervisor or designated representative to ensure any EI placed
in AWP storage is properly packaged to prevent damage to the item while in storage (no metal
against metal), and all electrostatic discharge precautions are taken.
       6.2.5. Fill out the EI information on the AFMC Form 503, AWP Checklist/Worksheet, to
       create an EI AWP record. Documentation needed on the AFMC Form 503 at a minimum
       will include: NSN, EIDN, ITN or WCD number and serial number (S/N). Complete,
       sign, and obtain proper coordination signatures on the AFMC Form 503.
   6.3. G337/ITS user will:
       6.3.1. Go into EPS/G402A EI AWP Selection Criteria screen (Attachment 7, Figure
       A7.1), press the Navigate menu and look under the Transaction/Query/File Maintenance
       heading and press EI AWP. Enter the EIDN in the DN field; press the query button, then
       press the add button (attachment 7, figure A7.2).
       6.3.2. Go to the 2082 Sub-Operation Review screen (Attachment 8, Figure A8.1) to see
       if the EI WCD was scanned in TAA using R05 or R06 delay code.
           6.3.2.1. Ensure that the last operation started shows last track point (TP) Type D (for
           delay) and delay AWP Y (for yes).
           6.3.2.2. If the sub-operation is not in R05 or R06 delay, give the WCD back to the
           shop supervisor to have the mechanic go into TAA and scan the sub-operation into
           the R05 or R06 delay status.
       6.3.3. Log the change in EI status on the AFMC Form 105 or AFMC Form 130 with the
       AWP status.
       6.3.4. Place all associated EI WCDs with the corresponding EI to be put into AWP.
   6.4. MABSM/Impresa user will:
       6.4.1. Ensure that all available inventories for completed and incomplete sub-assemblies
       are consumed using the MRSE screen (Attachment 8, Figure A8.2), and WO AWP
       Back Flush Adjustment (WAWB) screen (Attachment 9, Figure A9.1).
           6.4.1.1. On the WAWB screen, the relief method code needs to be changed from an
           A for auto consumption to M for manual consumption for all items on back order.
       6.4.2. Run a Consumed Components report from MRO Applications (Apps) Consumed
       Components screen (Attachment 9, Figure A9.2) to validate all available inventory has
12                                                            309MXWI23-111 6 JUNE 2012


     been consumed against the EI and EI subassemblies, and that all back ordered items are
     not issued (in red).
     6.4.3. Manually close all incomplete sub-assemblies WCDs by using the WO Status
     Change/Modify (WOCO) screen (Attachment 10, Figure A10.1).
     6.4.4. Open AWP Backorder to EI Cross Reference Inquiry (RINM) screen
     (Attachment 10, Figure A10.2) in WARRS/D035K and run a backorder to EIDN cross
     reference.
         6.4.4.1. Check to see if the exact items listed on the RINM screen matches the not
         issued items against the EI from the Consumed Component Report from MRO Apps.
     6.4.5. Change the status of the EIDN in OEOEH screen (Attachment 11) by entering a
     transaction (Trans) type of AWP, reason code and description of AWP. Change the line
     status to C (for closed) on the appropriate PDN and JON, and the line number of the EI
     going into AWP.
     6.4.6. Stamp and date all associated WCDs for the EI going into AWP.
     6.4.7. Log the change in EI status on the AFMC Form 105 or AFMC Form 130 with the
     AWP status.
     6.4.8. Place all associated EI WCDs with the corresponding EI to be put into AWP.
  6.5. Coordinate with DLA MSS to establish a detail and location in the X store for each
  NSN that is on backorder.
  6.6. Verify the NSN, P/N, ITN or WCD number, EIDN and S/N on the AFMC Form 503.
  Match the records in G337/ITS or MABSM/Impresa, EPS/G402A and JOPMS/G004L.
  6.7. If the EI is the last one OWO, initiate the JON closure process prior to putting the EI in
  AWP. This will ensure no backorders are against the JON when it closes.
  6.8. Using the AWP EI File Maintenance (RBOG) screen (Attachment 12, Figure A12.1)
  in WARRS/D035K, process a DIC (ZFA/L) transaction to place the EI in formal or official
  AWP. To accomplish this, the following steps must be performed:
     6.8.1. Enter the EIDN and press enter;
     6.8.2. Enter the SRD and AWP warehouse location and press enter twice.
         6.8.2.1. The appropriate AWP MIC designator, and AWP MIC function codes will
         automatically populate; press enter to complete the transaction.
         6.8.2.2. A processing successfully completed message will appear on the bottom left
         of the screen indicating the EI has successfully been placed in formal AWP.
  6.9. Check the AWP EI Inquiry (RINL) screen (Attachment 12, Figure A12.2) in
  WARRS/D035K to ensure the MIC designator and storage location data fields are updated.
  NOTE: The RINL screen in WARRS/D035K will now reflect the MIC designator, storage
  location and AWP MIC function code. This indicates the EI was taken off of OWO and is
  now in AWP storage. If multiple components were ordered, the AWP status will
  automatically increment to 002, 003, etc. This depends on the number of component NSNs
309MXWI23-111 6 JUNE 2012                                                                        13


   ordered. All backorders for the EI will now reflect the AWP MIC function code on the
   RINM screen in WARRS/D035K.
   6.10. Check the RINM screen (Attachment 13, Figure A13.1) with AWP due out document
   numbers in WARRS/D035K, to ensure backorders have been converted to AWP backorders
   and they are linked to the EIDN. Check to make sure that the backorders have the MIC
   function in the first six positions (denoted with an X in the fifth position) of the DN, and that
   they are tied to the EIDN.
   6.11. Run and review the exception inquiry report in ABOM AWP module, and take
   corrective action based on error message received.
       6.11.1. Exceptions must be worked so the EI can process successfully through the
       ABOM AWP module.
       6.11.2. The ABOM AWP supportability report shows the same information as the RINM
       screen in WARRS/D035K except the material issued on the original RCC.
   6.12. Ensure all parts issued, but not installed on the EI, are located with the EI and annotate
   on the AFMC Form 503 the NSN, DN, quantity, etc., of these parts.
   6.13. Sign and date the AFMC Form 503 prior to giving the EI to DLA MSS.
   6.14. Notify DLA MSS that the EI is ready to be moved to the AWP store for storage, and
   request a signature on the AFMC Form 503 for RA of the EI.
   6.15. Physically place the EI in the controlled designated AWP storage area, along with any
   parts that have already been received and all WCDs for the EI.
   6.16. Maintain the signed AFMC Form 503 until the EI is fully supportable and re-inducted.
7. EI in FWP Status (Fully Supportable). NOTE: The status on the RINL screen in
WARRS/D035K will change to FWP once all backorders have been released (INT from the
DLA warehouse or cancelled on an EI). This is regardless of whether the EI has been taken off
of OWO and put in formal AWP.
   7.1. The PSS/PST will:
       7.1.1. Check the RINM screen in WARRS/D035K to verify all backorders have been
       released.
       7.1.2. Verify material receipt into the AWP store (AWP MIC).
          7.1.2.1. Transactions clear from the NIMMS Material Due Record Response by
          Document Number (MN084P) screen (Attachment 13, Figure A13.2) once they
          close out financially.
          7.1.2.2. If the transaction is not on the MN084P screen, query NIMMS history by
          DN screen for received code (REC CD) 31 which is the receipt in the AWP store.
              7.1.2.2.1. The NIMMS History by DN Query (Attachment 13, Figure A13.3)
              should show the REC CD 31, which is the receipt of material into the AWP X
              store.
       7.1.3. Query NIMMS Store Material Record Inquiry (MN090P) screen (Attachment 13,

      screen (Attachment 14, Figure A14.1) by looking under the Status Indicator (SI) column
      for *F*.
      7.1.5. Monitor EIs in formal AWP status by using the EI 2 report in CA-DISPATCH of
      WARRS/D035K, to ensure these are re-inducted before another EI is issued from the
      DLA warehouse. This report will be reviewed at least daily.
      7.1.6. On Non-EXPRESS items, process a D7 RE PK transaction to move back to OWO
      using the AWP Induction Notice screen in EPS/G402A.
         7.1.6.1. Once the EI is moved to OWO. The EI can be removed from AWP storage
         and all of the components can be issued in ABOM using the AWP Issue screen, to the
         current JON prior to placing the EI back on the shop floor.
      7.1.7. Check the DIOH status code on the RINL screen in WARRS/D035K for a DIOH
      status code change from AWP to FWP.
         7.1.7.1. If the EI does not change to FWP in WARRS/D035K, previously cancelled
         backorders may be showing on the PSSD/PDN/EI NSN screen in EPS/G402A.

Driven a Requirement). The PSS/PST will:
   8.1. EXPRESS/D087X driven shops.
      8.1.1. Run the EI 1 report in CA-DISPATCH of WARRS/D035K daily, to monitor EIs
      in INW status which were previously in FWP status. The move notice (MN) can be
      viewed on the RINA screen in WARRS/D035K as a D7M transaction with an advice
      code of MN.
      8.1.2. Check the supportable AWP quantity in EXPRESS/D087X under the requirements
      summary for the applicable EI PDN.
         8.1.2.1. If the EI PDN is showing any supportable AWP quantities, go to the data
         entry item maintenance screen and adjust the predetermined acceptance probability
         and max supportable quantity fields as needed in EXPRESS/D087X.

10. AWP Rob Backs. A rob back is the removal of a serviceable component from one EI in
formal AWP, which is not physically attached to the EI, for use in keeping another EI
supportable. The benefiting EI must have a backorder established which will be file maintained
to the donor EI. The PSS/PST in coordination with the DLA MSS authorizes rob backs.
   10.1. There are two AWP rob back categories: AWP to AWP, and AWP to floor. The
   benefiting or receiving EI must have a backorder established which will be file maintained to
   the donor EI (the item in AWP storage).
       10.1.1. The PSS/PST will:
          10.1.1.1. Utilize the AWP backorder status reports, EI 2 reports of the CA-
          DISPATCH in WARRS/D035K, or AWP logs to determine if there are any
          components which can be moved from one EI to another to make it FWP. NOTE:
          The rob back menu in ABOM can also be used to determine if components are
          available to make an OWO EI FWP.
          10.1.1.2. Monitor and determine if any components can be moved from a donor EI to
          another EI to make it fully supportable.
          10.1.1.3. After approval by production support supervisor or designated
          representative, process transfer transactions by using the rob back function within the
          ABOM AWP Management (MGT) Module, and the WARRS/D035K AWP Rob
          Back Cannibalization File Maintenance (RBOH) screen (Attachment 17, Figure
          A17.3).
          10.1.1.4. AWP to AWP. This option is used to rob a component part from one EI to
          another when both are in formal AWP. The donor DN will show a quantity received
          and the benefitting DN will show a quantity due. NOTE: The quantities must be the
          same for both.
              10.1.1.4.1. Access the AWP MGT Module in ABOM, then select rob back.
                  10.1.1.4.1.1. Type in the component NIIN, and click the AWP to AWP
                  option.

                   10.1.1.4.1.1.1. This will display the DN from Which to Rob Report screen.
                 10.1.1.4.1.2. Select the component part that will be taken (known as the
                 donor).
                 10.1.1.4.1.3. Select the DN to receive the component part. A Rob Back
                 Verification screen will be displayed.
                 10.1.1.4.1.4. To complete the rob back process, enter a Y. A screen will be
                 displayed to indicate the rob back has been completed.
              10.1.1.4.2. Access the RBOH screen in WARRS/D035K to perform
              cannibalization between separate EIs from a released due-out document, to an EI
              with an open backorder.
                 10.1.1.4.2.1. Input the due-out DN of the backordered component part, and
                 the EIDN the component part will be transferred to.
                   10.1.1.4.2.1.1. Verify the information and complete the transaction.
          10.1.1.5. AWP to Floor. This option is used to rob a component part from an EI in
          formal AWP, to an EI that is currently INW on the shop floor. The donor AWP DN
          will show a quantity received and the EI INW must have an existing backorder. The
          quantities must be the same for both.
              10.1.1.5.1. Access the AWP MGT Module in ABOM, then select rob back.
                 10.1.1.5.1.1. Type in the component part NIIN, and click the AWP to floor
                 option.
                   10.1.1.5.1.1.1. This will display the DN from Which to Rob Report screen.
                 10.1.1.5.1.2. Select the component part that will be taken (known as the
                 donor).
                 10.1.1.5.1.3. Enter the DN that will benefit from a rob back in the T field and
                 enter Y to process and complete the rob back.
              10.1.1.5.2. Access the RBOH screen in WARRS/D035K to perform
              cannibalization between separate EIs from a released due-out document, to an EI
              with an open backorder.
                 10.1.1.5.2.1. Input the due-out DN of the released component part, and the
                 EIDN the component part will be transferred to.
                   10.1.1.5.2.1.1. Verify the information and complete the transaction.
              10.1.1.5.3. Query the RINM screen in WARRS/D035K to verify the receiving
              EIDN shows a quantity in the released quantity field.
              10.1.1.5.4. Query the RINM screen in WARRS/D035K to verify the donor EIDN
              shows the backordered quantity was transferred.
11. Cannibalization of Inducted Items. An AWP cannibalization of inducted EIs occurs when
a component part ordered against an EIDN has to be file maintained to another EIDN, because
the component was cannibalized for use in keeping it supportable. Cannibalization of inducted
items approval and execution is internal to depot maintenance. The procedures require
309MXWI23-111 6 JUNE 2012                                                                     19


transactions to be accomplished in ABOM AWP MGT Module and WARRS/D035K RBOH
screen.
   11.1. Follow the same procedures in paragraph 10.1.1 thru paragraph 10.1.1.5.4 except
   use the Cannibalization menu in ABOM.
12. Turning in an EI from AWP without Completing Repairs. This option is available in
ABOM and is used only when a determination from the item manager (IM) is made to turn-in an
EI without completing the repair. ABOM will transfer the AWP store balance for component
parts received against the EI to the Y store, and prompt the requestor to file maintain (roll to
another EI or request cancellation) any open linked backorders associated with the EI using the
NIMMS Backorder Modify/Cancellation (MN123P) screen.
   12.1. The PSS/PST will coordinate with DLA MSS personnel to change EIDN DIOH status
   code from FWP to INW in WARRS/D035K RINL screen if Non-EXPRESS/D087X driven.
       12.1.1. If the EI is EXPRESS/D087X driven after the DIOH status code is changed to
       INW in WARRS/D035K, wait 24-hours and process an F condition turn-in using
       EPS/G402A.
       12.1.2. Coordination with DLA MSS is required to ensure parts are physically moved to
       the Y store location from the X store location.
13. Turn-In of an EI. To return the EI to supply when repairs are completed, the PSS/PST will
initiate the following actions:
   13.1. Process a turn-in transaction using the same EIDN created when the EI was inducted
   for repair in the applicable MIS.
       13.1.1. Access the 2195 EI Turn-In screen for the G337/ITS users to turn EIs back into
       supply.
       13.1.2. Access the Sales Order Shipping (OEOES ) screen for the MABSM/Impresa
       users to turn EIs back into supply for F (repairable) and A (serviceable) condition codes,
       and OEOEH is used to turn in H (condemned) condition code assets.
   13.2. Scan all WCDs in TAA closed.
   13.3. Stamp and date all EI WCDs.
   13.4. Log the sale of the EI on the AFMC Form 105 or AFMC Form 130.
   13.5. Ensure the turn-in transaction has processed correctly and interfaced with
   WARRS/D035K in the RINL screen, JOPMS/G004L and EPS/G402A. The DIOH status
   code in WARRS/D035K will change to TIN if processed correctly.
       13.5.1. The transaction will cause the INW balance to decrease, and the INT from
       maintenance balance to increase in WARRS/D035K. The INT will appear with a MM
       status on the history screen in WARRS/D035K when the turn-in is in serviceable
       condition, or it will appear as *Z* condition code if the item is other than serviceable.
           13.5.1.1. Contact DLA MSS if the turn-in transaction has not processed, or it
           processed incorrectly in WARRS/D035K.
 20                                                            309MXWI23-111 6 JUNE 2012


   13.6. Review the output document for a turn-in ZZ stuffer resulting from processing the
   turn-in transaction.
       13.6.1. If successfully processed, the transaction will read with a ZZ in the action suffix
       code of the line of data on the stuffer.
          13.6.1.1. The action suffix code is located in the last two record positions of the line
          of data.
       13.6.2. If the action code is other than ZZ, the transaction did not process successfully;
       correct the erroneous information and re-input.
   13.7. Attach the turn-in ZZ stuffer to the EI and arrange for EI pick up by DLA.
   13.8. After receipt of the EI is acknowledged and processed into the Distribution Standard
   System (DSS), the receipt transaction overlays into WARRS/D035K. This transaction is the
   last leg in the DIOH process.
       13.8.1. This transaction decreases the INT from maintenance balance, and increases the
       applicable balance in the supply systems. For further guidance on EI turn-in refer to
       AFMAN 23-110, Volume III, Part Two, Chapter 6.
14. AK Exceptions. AK exceptions are generated when an EI is turned-in with a backorder still
linked to the EI in WARRS/D035K. An AK exception indicates potential material problems or
an inaccurate bill of material (BOM). The PSS/PST, planner, and the production shop must
work together to prevent AK exceptions from generating.
   14.1. PSS/PST will:
       14.1.1. Perform research to determine if the backorder was satisfied through a work-
       around (government purchase card buy, local manufacture, reclaim, etc.,) process.
          14.1.1.1. If a work-around process was used. Notify DLA customer support
          specialist of the work-around, and provide the NSN and quantity of the item
          purchased to determine if a demand history adjustment (DHA) is required. Refer to
          309 MXWI 23-107, Processing Demand History Adjustment Data to Defense
          Logistics Agency, for additional guidance.
       14.1.2. Conduct research and make every effort to roll linked backorders to another EI if
       the part is not already ordered against the EI. Ensure duplicate backorders are not
       created.
          14.1.2.1. To roll the backorder to another EI, update transactions must be processed
          in NIMMS and WARRS/D035K. Use the NIMMS Material Due Update (MN021P)
          screen and provide the new EIDN.
       14.1.3. Use the RBOH screen in WARRS/D035K to transfer the backordered due-out
       DN to the new EI.
       14.1.4. Request cancellation using the NIMMS MN123P screen when it is determined
       the backorder is no longer required.
          14.1.4.1. The request transaction will overlay to WARRS/D035K. For further
          guidance on backorder cancellation refer to 309 MXWI 23-105, Backorder
          Reconciliation and Cancellation.
309MXWI23-111 6 JUNE 2012                                                                  21


15. AWP Reconciliation: Reconciliation is imperative to provide accurate visibility and
reporting of AWPs. The purpose of reconciliation is to ensure proper accountability of AWP
EIs, piece parts on hand, and piece parts on order. The AWP reconciliation of EIs will be
performed annually by the DLA MSS.
   15.1. Use of the DIOH AWP management reports in WARRS/D035K is required to
   complete this reconciliation. The AWP reconciliation will be coordinated with the PSS/PST,
   shop floor mechanic and scheduled by the DLA MSS. All documentation is required to be
   file maintained.
      15.1.1. The PSS/PST will use the RINM screen in WARRS/D035K, and use the EIDN to
      verify backorders and ensure backorder is still required.
          15.1.1.1. If existing backorders are invalid or no longer needed, the backorder must
          be canceled or file maintained using the RBOH screen in WARRS/D035K, AWP
          Update menu in ABOM and MN021P screen in NIMMS to an existing requirement.
