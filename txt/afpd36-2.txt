SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision deletes the measurement and metrics and updates the reference information and acronyms.

1. The Air Force will implement civilian personnel recruitment and placement programs in full compli-
ance with merit systems principles; in full recognition of prohibited personnel practices; and in full sup-
port of veteransâ€™ special rights and privileges for Federal civil service employment.

2. Staffing civilian positions with people who are highly qualified and representative of the civilian labor
force is essential to sustaining a superior Air Force. The Air Force will ensure that positions are filled
based on merit and qualifications without unlawful discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex,
national origin, age, marital status, disability, political affiliation, or other nonmerit factors. The Air Force
must provide a workplace free of sexual harassment for all employees.

3. Consistent with Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and Office of Personnel Man-
agement (OPM) requirements, the Air Force will develop and implement recruitment strategies that
assure a diverse Air Force workforce and provide equal opportunities to minorities, women, and persons
with disabilities at all grade/pay band levels, in every employment category and in every major organiza-
tional element.

4. The Air Force will fill positions from appropriate sources consistent with the priorities established by
law, regulation, or higher authority.

5. The Air Force will implement a merit promotion program through which it will identify, evaluate,
qualify, and select candidates for promotion using solely job-related criteria based on legitimate position
requirements. The merit promotion program ensures the Air Force is able to draw from applicant pools of
highly qualified, diverse candidates for promotions to positions at all levels.

6. Managers or supervisors will not select a relative for a position anywhere in the organization under his
or her jurisdiction or control. Additionally, a manager, supervisor, or other public official having the
authority to appoint, employ, promote, or advance persons or to recommend this action, may not advocate
or recommend a relative for any position within the Department of Defense (DoD).

7. The Air Force will utilize part-time employment, including job sharing.

8. The Air Force will hire experts and consultants to accomplish mission requirements when highly spe-
cialized individuals cannot be obtained through normal recruitment sources.

9. In foreign overseas areas, the Air Force will employ a civilian manpower mix of U.S. citizens and local
nationals that provides the best financial value to the Air Force, ensures conformance with host country
international agreements or treaties, considers availability of qualified local national personnel, and max-
imizes career opportunities for U.S. citizens. Air Force will adhere to and enforce the DoD policy limiting
the employment of U.S. citizens in foreign overseas areas to five years.

10. Air Force will decide whether a Reduction in Force (RIF) is necessary, when it will take place, and
what positions are to be abolished. Separation incentives, such as the Voluntary Separation Incentive Pro-
gram (VSIP) and Voluntary Early Retirement Authority (VERA), will be judiciously used with other RIF
avoidance actions such as curtailing recruitment and the reassignment of employees to vacant positions.

11. The DoD Priority Placement Program (PPP) is the primary means to minimize the adverse effects on
employees caused by RIF, base closure, realignments, consolidations, contracting out, position classifica-
tion decisions, rotation from overseas, and transfers of function. Air Force supports and will ensure that
all commanders, managers and supervisors comply with the spirit, letter and intent of the PPP program by
the timely counseling, registration, matching, selecting and release of impacted PPP registrants.

12. The Air Force will establish civilian career fields to facilitate hiring, development, advancement, and
sustainment of the highest quality civilian workforce possible within merit principles guidelines. The
career field approach provides the necessary process and tools to develop career civilians who possess the
right professional, technical, managerial, and administrative competencies to satisfy Air Force needs.

13. The Air Force will use recruitment and relocation incentives and student loan repayment to help
recruit new employees and relocate current employees to positions that would be difficult to fill in the
absence of an incentive. The Air Force will use retention incentives to help retain employees with unusu-
ally high or unique qualifications or who are fulfilling a special need that makes it essential to retain the
employee when the employee would likely leave the Federal service in the absence of an incentive. Man-
agement officials at all levels must consider all pay-setting factors including the short- and long-term
financial consequences of pay decisions prior to approving an incentive.

14. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower and Reserve Affairs (SAF/MR) serves as an
agent of the Secretary and provides guidance, direction, and oversight for all matters pertaining to the for-
mulation, review, and execution of plans, policies, programs, and budgets addressing civilian recruitment
and placement.

15. The Deputy Chief of Staff, Manpower and Personnel (HQ USAF/A1) executes personnel policy and
develops, coordinates and approves essential procedural guidance for the management of recruitment and
placement of all civilian employees, including the Civilian Career Field Management Program.

16. See Attachment 1 for related and interfacing publications.
