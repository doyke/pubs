This manual provides tools and information that implements AFI 38-201, Determining Manpower
Requirements. It may be used to implement and maintain the United States Air Force Management Engi-
neering Program. It explains how to use the different tools available when developing and quantifying an
Air Force Manpower Standard (AFMS). It applies to any project officer responsible for the development
and quantification of manpower requirements. Maintain and dispose of records created as a result of pre-
scribed processes in accordance with AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS

Section 1A—Flow Process Charting

1.1. General Concepts.
     1.1.1. The flow process charting technique shows a picture of the sequence of all operations, transpor-
     tation, delays, inspections, and storage of a work procedure. It includes information for analysis such
     as time needed and distance moved. It is a simple device for visualizing each step of a procedure that
     is often too long and complicated to be described in words.
     1.1.2. Like several other charting techniques, flow process charting can be used in a variety of appli-
     cations. This guidance aids the study craftsman by noting general applications, advantages, and limi-
     tations of this technique.
        1.1.2.1. Use flow process charting to study processes involving either personnel or material. Per-
        sonnel charting shows the process in terms of movements and actions done by work center person-
        nel. The activity shown on such a chart includes all forms of effort, mental and physical. A chart
        that follows material can show the steps in an office, like processing forms or records as they pass
        from one worker to another, or any material being processed in a shop, plant, or warehouse.
        1.1.2.2. When preparing the flow process chart, it is important to separate the events that occur to
        the material from the activity of the person. Do not chart both on the same chart.
        1.1.2.3. Cost reductions most often happen as a result of simplifying, eliminating, combining or
        changing the sequence of activities of the operators as they take part in a process. Focus attention
        on steps done by individuals; however, do not overlook analysis of travel, delays, storage, etc.,
        that affects the overall time.
        1.1.2.4. A flow chart shows “hidden” costs, such as excess distances traveled, delays, and tempo-
        rary storage. Once these costs are found, improvements can be made.
        1.1.2.5. A chart shows steps in a process that may be deleted, combined, or changed to improve
        the sequence and make the procedure more effective.
        1.1.2.6. A chart also helps improve the process by showing the steps (operations, inspections,
        etc.) that need to be given to another person.
        1.1.2.7. In general, the flow process chart contains a lot of detail. It is not easily adapted to a com-
        plicated process. Use the chart to study individual components of an assembly or one part in an
        overall process. To avoid suboptimization (simply passing costs to another work center) ensure
        revisions to a process do not cause an adverse effect on the overall process.
        1.1.2.8. The flow process chart gives most of the information needed to identify potential methods
        improvement, but it does not pictorially show the flow of work. Sometimes, however, such added
        information is needed to develop a new method. For example, before a transportation step can be
        shortened, it may be necessary to see where floor space can be changed to reduce distances. Like-
        wise, it helps to visualize work stations, temporary storage points, and the overall layout of the
        facilities. Thus, the flow process chart is often used with other techniques such as flow or string
        diagrams.

   1.1.3. Paragraphs 1.2. through 1.4. detail flow process charting and show how to use DD Form 1723,
   Flow Process Chart.

1.2. Defining an Activity. The basic steps in flow process charting are the same ones that apply to all
work simplification. After identifying a process to be analyzed, determine the beginning and ending of the
particular process and stick to it. Don't be sidetracked by other processes that may occur at the same time
and place. Record all details of the process. Describe each step in the process and classify it as one of five
types of activities: operation, transportation, inspection, delay, or storage.

1.3. Flow Process Charting Procedures.
   1.3.1. Enter each step in the process on the DD Form 1723. Use this form to record both present and
   proposed work processes.
   1.3.2. The first step in preparing a DD Form 1723 is to complete the data in the upper left corner of
   the chart. Be specific in identifying the process to be charted, persons or materials being traced
   through the process, and the place and time the process begins and ends.
   1.3.3. Next, list steps in the process in brief narrative form in the column under the heading Details of
   Present or Proposed Method. Include every detail and verify this information with personnel doing the
   work. It is important to remember when listing the steps to cover the essential job parts (make ready,
   do, and put away). Refer to paragraph 1.4.4. for clarification of these “parts”.
       1.3.3.1. Make sure details are clear, specific, and listed in the order they occur.
       1.3.3.2. Enter distances when transportation steps occur.
       1.3.3.3. List quantity and time with operations, inspections, and delays. Use a standard unit of
       time throughout the chart.
       1.3.3.4. If distance, quantity, or time varies in any given step, enter an average figure.
       1.3.3.5. Include every specific detail on the chart, or the chart will be of little value. Accurate
       analysis and good improvements depend on an entire picture of current procedures.
   1.3.4. After all steps have been identified and listed, classify each according to the standard symbols
   in column 12b. Draw a line from each symbol to the next. After giving each step a symbol, enter the
   total number of steps by each type in the summary box in the upper right corner of the chart.

1.4. Work Flow Analysis. Analyze work flow as follows.
   1.4.1. When studying the data on the chart of the present method, ask these questions for each step.
       1.4.1.1. Can it be eliminated? Will elimination of this step simply mean another work center must
       complete the task?
       1.4.1.2. Should it be combined with another step? Will this reduce overall cycle time?
       1.4.1.3. Should the sequence be changed? How does this change current delays and affect the
       queues?
       1.4.1.4. How can it be simplified? Can technology be inserted to ease the workload?
   1.4.2. Use the checklist in Figure 1.1.. to analyze the present method flow process chart.

                  CHECKLIST FOR ANALYZING A FLOW PROCESS CHART
1. Apply the following questions to each step in the flow process:
1.1. WHY is it necessary? Can the entire process or some of the steps be eliminated?
1.2. WHAT is actually done? Are all steps included? What should be done?
1.3. WHERE should the step be done? Should it be done in another place?
1.4. WHEN should it be done? Is it done in the right sequence? Can it be combined or simplified by
moving ahead or back?
1.5. WHO should do it? Is the right person (skill) handling it, or can some other skill do it better?
1.6. HOW is it being done? Can it be done better with different equipment or layout?
2. Apply the following additional questions to the overall work process:
2.1. Have proper administrative controls of the work been set up?
2.2. How often is work checked for accuracy?
2.3. When would an error be caught if present checks were left out? Are there fail-safes that can be put
in place to eliminate the need for human detection, harm, or error?
2.4. How serious is the result of errors that are not found?
2.5. Is a sampling check for errors enough?
2.6. What inspections can be merged with operations?
2.7. Can storage locations be moved or cut out?
2.8. Can transportation be shortened or cut out?
2.9. What are the causes of interruptions and exceptions to the work? How can they be cut down or cut
out?
2.10. Will a new layout or use of a machine cut out the necessity for moving work?
2.11. Can work be given to a location in a prearranged sequence?
2.12. Are equipment and supplies properly arranged?
2.13. Is there duplication of effort in whole or in part?
     1.4.3. Be careful when simplifying, eliminating, combining, or changing steps. Avoid haste when
     making changes and showing results. Study and analyze the effect of each action. Do not combine
     operations that require thinking with those of a routine nature. A change in sequence at one point may
     cause a problem at another. Oversimplification may impair controls. Placing too much responsibility
     at one point may affect the quality of work. Be thorough in data gathering, accurate in charting, delib-
     erate in analyzing, and thorough in recommending changes.
     1.4.4. Every job has three parts: "make ready," "do," and "put away." "Make ready" is the time and
     activity involved in preparing for a job, such as securing materials, going to the files for papers, or
     receiving a work request. "Do" is the productive phase of work. "Put away" is the time involved in
     cleaning up, such as returning papers to file, stacking and packaging finished work, or placing work in
     distribution. When analyzing the chart, it is helpful to mentally group all steps accordingly. Study "do"
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                         17


   steps first because if they are eliminated or changed, they automatically cut out or change accompany-
   ing "make ready" and "put away" steps.
   1.4.5. Question each step and make notes on the chart indicating possible improvements. Check types
   of potential changes in column 12h. Check the form several times because second and third checks
   may reveal possible improvements previously missed.
   1.4.6. After completing the analysis, prepare a new DD Form 1723 to show details of the proposed
   method. Show improvements in the summary in the upper right-hand corner of the form. Use the pro-
   posed process chart to help sell improvements. It may also be used as a permanent record of standard
   practices for work center personnel to follow.
   1.4.7. The addition of a flow diagram chart can support the flow process chart, since flow charts by
   themselves show little about the physical picture of the work area.
   1.4.8. In addition to or in place of DD Form 1723, it is permissible to accomplish flow process chart-
   ing using available computer software. The same kind of analysis outlined in Figure 1.1. should be
   applied to the computer-generated flow process chart.

Section 1B—Layout Analysis

1.5. General Concepts.
   1.5.1. Layout analysis studies are used to improve production, ease physical exertion, and shorten dis-
   tances of travel for material and personnel. They concentrate on the physical flow of work. They may
   lead to substantial improvements and are very useful as an aid to other method improvement tech-
   niques. A layout study is defined as a systematic method to analyze procedures and facilities and to
   develop a plan that gives an optimum workable arrangement of personnel and equipment.
   1.5.2. The primary objective of a layout study is to arrange equipment and facilities to achieve mate-
   rial flows at the lowest cost, with the least amount of handling, and in the shortest amount of time.
   Additional objectives include:
      1.5.2.1. Increasing efficiency by getting a straight-line flow of work and minimizing backtracking
      in work processing.
      1.5.2.2. Providing each employee with enough space to work efficiently while, at the same time,
      minimizing total space. AFOSH/OSHA standards specify minimum work space requirements.
      1.5.2.3. Providing the best working conditions in the space available.
      1.5.2.4. Allowing expansion, reduction, and rearrangement of space to meet changing needs.
      1.5.2.5. Eliminating items of furniture and equipment not needed in the work center operation.
   1.5.3. Potential benefits of an effective layout are:
      1.5.3.1. Improved production. Streamlining the flow of work increases production and improves
      quality. Labor costs are correspondingly lowered. Every moment saved in travel and delays aids in
      increasing the production rate.
      1.5.3.2. Increased employee comfort and safety. A more comfortable employee in a safe environ-
      ment generates higher productivity and takes less time off.
18                                                            AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


        1.5.3.3. Reduced labor turnovers. A more comfortable, attractive office helps recruit better
        employees and helps keep present employees. Consideration of the individual employee often pro-
        duces pride and loyalty.
        1.5.3.4. Improved supervision. Careful layout planning makes controlling the work flow and
        inspecting easier for the supervisor.
        1.5.3.5. Improved quality. Better layout reduces distractions and worker fatigue, eliminates frus-
        tration and undue pressures, and improves the quality of workmanship.
        1.5.3.6. Better space utilization. Valuable floor space is used more efficiently through effective
        planning and layout.
        1.5.3.7. Reduced costs. Cost is the most important benefit. Speeding production, controlling
        waste, and reducing labor expenses all save money.

1.6. Layout Analysis Applicability.
     1.6.1. Steps necessary to conduct a layout study will vary with each situation. The techniques pre-
     sented in this chapter may give more information than necessary for a given study, but all might apply.
     Flexibility is the key word.
     1.6.2. The mere drawing of a proposed layout does not constitute a layout study. A hasty examination
     of the work center or function may reveal inadequacies in the present layout, but a thorough analysis
     of procedures and facilities usually reveals underlying causes for problems that create low productiv-
     ity. Accurate and detailed definition of the problem is essential for problem solution.
     1.6.3. Normally, layout studies are originated due to problems caused by one or a combination of
     these: Ineffectiveness of current layout or work flow; changes in volume of production or services;
     changes in mission, product, service, or equipment; changes in the number of people in the work cen-
     ter; computerization; poor work environment; frequent accidents; obsolete facilities; or new facilities.
     1.6.4. Classify layout analysis studies according to the magnitude of the effort.
        1.6.4.1. Minor change to present layout.
        1.6.4.2. Major rearrangement of existing layout.
        1.6.4.3. Relocating into other existing facilities.

1.7. Familiarization and Data Collection.
     1.7.1. Familiarization Phase.
        1.7.1.1. Define precise objectives and limits of the study.
        1.7.1.2. Check current organization, mission statements, and authorized and assigned manpower.
        1.7.1.3. Check current operating directives and previous studies completed within the function.
        1.7.1.4. Define individual responsibilities. An effective way to define who is doing what is to
        have work center personnel prepare activity lists.
        1.7.1.5. Define machine and equipment needs.
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                            19


      1.7.1.6. Consider any additional needs such as safety and security. AFI 91-302, Air Force Occu-
      pational and Environmental Safety, Fire Protection, and Health (AFOSH) Standards, contains
      guidance and direction for accident prevention. Other 91-series instructions address specific
      safety environments. The 31-series instructions specify security considerations.
   1.7.2. Observation and Data Collection Phase.
      1.7.2.1. Document the present layout. A layout of the current arrangement of equipment, furni-
      ture, and elements of the physical space (walls, windows, doors, electrical outlets, lights, miscel-
      laneous structural obstructions, etc.) forms a background for comparative purposes during
      development of improvements. A study of the present layout helps in determining where expan-
      sion or change is needed most, sets the relationship between various operations, and aids in iden-
      tifying the existence of duplicate or overlapping functions. It also serves as a checklist of existing
      equipment and furniture. Make sure the present layout is a graphic representation of the work cen-
      ter as it exists. Use one of three common methods: scaled drawings, two-dimensional cutout or
      stick-on templates, or three-dimensional models made to a convenient or standard scale.
      1.7.2.2. Prepare the current layout.
          1.7.2.2.1. Measure floor space involved. This may be done with a tape measure or by use of
          blueprints. Be sure to validate any blueprint before use.
          1.7.2.2.2. Prepare a sketch of the floor plan, locating doors, windows, posts, fixed and mov-
          able partitions, light fixtures, and utility outlets.
          1.7.2.2.3. Sketch furniture, equipment, etc., showing types and distances from fixed refer-
          ences.
          1.7.2.2.4. Show any peculiar details such as floor drains, electrical outlets, plumbing, etc.
          1.7.2.2.5. You may show names of individuals or duty positions relative to furniture and
          equipment.
      1.7.2.3. Analyze results. Select relevant techniques to analyze work flows, personnel movements,
      and methods and procedures as they relate to the problems under study. How individuals relate to
      operations must be a governing factor in any layout. Systematic study of operations, processes,
      and procedures involves individual (or group) activities. Two of the more common techniques
      used for layout analysis are flow diagrams and string diagrams that are discussed in paragraph
      1.8.. There are numerous other acceptable layout analysis techniques available that may be better
      suited. Procedures for using these other techniques are described in various industrial engineering
      periodicals and books available at your library.

1.8. Two Common Techniques Used for Layout Analysis. Other techniques can be found in the Hand-
book of Industrial Engineering, 1992 edition, Chapter 67.
   1.8.1. Flow Diagrams.
      1.8.1.1. Prepare a scaled layout chart of the area under study. Use a standard scale when preparing
      the chart (for example, 1/4 inch = 1 foot).
      1.8.1.2. Record on the layout, as near the point of occurrence as possible, each step in the work
      process. Use the same symbols as on a flow process chart.
20                                                             AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


        1.8.1.3. Number each symbol in sequence. If the diagram is being used in conjunction with a flow
        process chart, match each step to the chart.
        1.8.1.4. Connect the symbols with a line to show the path traveled by the person or material under
        observation.
        1.8.1.5. When presenting two or more work flows, use a different color for each flow.
        1.8.1.6. Study the flow diagram, along with the DD Form 1723, for improvement possibilities.
        Use the diagram checklist in Figure 1.2..

Figure 1.2. Diagram Checklist.

1. Work Flow:
1.1. Does work flow follow a relatively straight line with minimum backtracking and crossover? Where
are the bottlenecks?
1.2. Has each step been questioned and analyzed?
1.3. Have other work flows been considered?
1.4. Does furniture and equipment spacing consider at least minimum space requirements per worker as
outlined in AFI 32-1024?
1.5. Does layout consider person-person and person-equipment work flow relationships?
1.6. Is there excess furniture or equipment?
1.7. Would movement of furniture or equipment reduce or eliminate the number of moves or distances?
1.8. Does layout recognize nature of work such as privacy or security considerations?
2. Diagram:
2.1. Does diagram portray its story clearly?
2.2. Is diagram too elaborate and/or cluttered?
2.3. Is it easier to understand than a chart or narrative description? Is it more effective?
     1.8.2. String Diagrams.
        1.8.2.1. Mount a scaled layout chart (e.g., 1/4 inch = 1 foot) on material such as plywood or cork
        that will hold pins, nails, tacks, etc.
        1.8.2.2. Insert pins, etc.; on the layout at each place people or material stop along the path through
        operations and processes in the work area. Put a pin on each exact location. Additional pins may
        be placed along the path to show the exact route.
        1.8.2.3. Starting with the entry point in the flow, connect the pins with a string by looping each
        pin, in correct sequence, to the end point of the flow.
        1.8.2.4. Label or otherwise identify each step.
        1.8.2.5. Use different colors or types of string to represent different workers, products, or materi-
        als.
        1.8.2.6. String may be measured to get distances, using the same scale as on the layout chart.
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                       21


      1.8.2.7. Analyze the completed diagram for areas needing improvement (and congested masses of
      string indicating process bottlenecks). Refer to the diagram checklist in 1.2..

1.9. Layout Analysis Development.
   1.9.1. Analyze all data collected. This systematic approach is recommended.
      1.9.1.1. Determine facility location.
      1.9.1.2. Plan overall layout.
      1.9.1.3. Plan detailed layouts.
      1.9.1.4. Plan processes and machinery around material functions.
      1.9.1.5. Plan the layout around processes and machinery.
   1.9.2. Consider these needs.
      1.9.2.1. Set up space, storage, production, service, safety, people, and type of work.
      1.9.2.2. Furnish better working conditions to include lighting; use of colors; ventilation; noise
      levels; safety; access areas; walls, partitions, and floors; communications; and location of break
      areas, lavatories, water fountains, and locker rooms, etc.
      1.9.2.3. Set up telephone/information system needs including: number and placement of phones
      and lines, intercom systems, and cabling, etc.
      1.9.2.4. Set up a work flow that follows the simplest and shortest path.
   1.9.3. Prepare proposed flow process and work distribution charts to optimize work flows and travel.
   Document the proposal on a revised flow or string diagram.
   1.9.4. Check all recommendations, discuss them with work center personnel and the functional super-
   visor, solicit recommended changes, and delete impractical data from analysis.
   1.9.5. Look at the differences between the proposed layout and present layout and evaluate these dif-
   ferences. Does the proposed layout:
      1.9.5.1. Produce a better product or increase production?
      1.9.5.2. Smooth the flow of work or reduce effort?
      1.9.5.3. Minimize material handling?
      1.9.5.4. Reduce costs, waste, and scrap?
      1.9.5.5. Release floor spaces or reduce wasted space?
      1.9.5.6. Decrease maintenance?
      1.9.5.7. Eliminate congestion or improve housekeeping?
      1.9.5.8. Facilitate scheduling or reduce quality checks?
      1.9.5.9. Make supervision easier?
      1.9.5.10. Reduce accidents or improve morale?
      1.9.5.11. Allow for future expansion?
22                                                             AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


     1.9.6. Finalize proposed layouts, charts, and graphs necessary to present study recommendations.
     Include a concise implementation plan in enough detail for systematic implementation.

1.10. Implementing the Proposed Plan.
     1.10.1. Present all recommendations and the proposed implementation plan to the supervisor, then to
     other key senior leadership personnel. Recognize that it is the unknown rather than the new that cre-
     ates apprehension. Sell major ideas of the study in the order of their anticipated acceptability to man-
     agement. Start off with those of a less controversial nature and follow with those most likely to
     involve more client hesitance. A close alternative will often be readily accepted, thereby avoiding
     complete rejection of an idea or proposal.
     1.10.2. On acceptance of final implementation plans, make sure all affected personnel are fully
     informed of the entire plan and their specific responsibilities. Set up a trial period to test new proce-
     dures and layout arrangements. Continued contact during the test period is necessary to make sure all
     work center personnel understand, and to revise any aspects of improvement actions that are contrary
     to study objectives. Recommendations must be instituted as planned.

Section 1C—Systems and Procedures Analysis

1.11. General Concepts.
     1.11.1. Systems and procedures analysis is a specific technique used to solve information and paper
     flow problems. Systems and procedures are essential parts of the management process. They put man-
     agerial decisions into action. They provide for routine handling of recurring situations.
     1.11.2. Systems and procedures analysis is well suited for looking at paper flow and clerical activi-
     ties. This analysis studies the flow of paperwork, the forms used, and where and how work is done.
     1.11.3. The following terms are used in systems and procedures analysis:
        1.11.3.1. System. A network of related procedures integrated to meet an organization's objectives.
        1.11.3.2. Procedures. A sequence of operations set up to get uniform processing by telling what
        actions are to be taken, who takes them, the sequence to be followed, and the tools to be used.
        1.11.3.3. Method. A manual, mechanical, or electronic means for individual operations.

1.12. Preparing a System Diagram. A system diagram is a chart made to aid comprehension of a gen-
eral activity and its components. It is used for doing relatively coarse analysis of an entire system. There
is no specified form; however, the form used should give a framework for the procedures making up a
system. The elements in a system diagram should include the system description; procedures action; orga-
nizational elements; skills; equipment; information inputs, resources, and outputs; and objectives and
goals. Information for doing a system diagram is collected through normal fact-gathering methods.
Entries for each of these recommended sections are described below.
     1.12.1. System Description. Tell how the system is related to the mission, functional activities, and
     managerial goals.
     1.12.2. Procedures Action. Summarize what is in each procedure. Use one sentence for each proce-
     dure.
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                           23


   1.12.3. Organizational Elements. List all the elements responsible for doing the procedures action
   statement in enough detail for clarity.
   1.12.4. Skills. List the Air Force specialties needed.
   1.12.5. Equipment. List the equipment used.
   1.12.6. Information Inputs. List information entering the system or procedure. The entry identifies the
   source of the information. There is not always an input to each major action, nor is it necessary to list
   the output of the preceding step as an input.
   1.12.7. Information Resources. List data sources such as reports, files, records, guides, and directives.
   Include in this section information resources added to, or updated as part of, the action.
   1.12.8. Information Outputs. List all information created or dispatched as a result of the procedure.
   Identify the format and destination of the outputs if going outside of the procedure. There is not
   always an output from each major action.
   1.12.9. Objectives and Goals. Rank, for each procedure, the qualitative aspects of performance and
   the quantitative measures used.

1.13. Preparing a Procedure Chart.
   1.13.1. A procedure chart is specifically designed to give, in symbol format, the type of work found
   in an administrative environment.
   1.13.2. It follows the flow of information between work stations and shows decisions made and
   actions taken by individuals in these stations. It also shows interrelationships between two or more
   forms, forms and material, or forms and workers.
   1.13.3. A procedure chart gives a quick, accurate, and comprehensive picture of the total activity. It is
   used to show both existing and proposed procedures. When properly done, a chart is clear and can eas-
   ily give a complete and correct picture. The objective is to chart normal routine action, recognize pos-
   sible alternatives, and stay in the main stream of the procedure. If done well, the procedure chart will
   show the following information about a procedure:
      1.13.3.1. The title, number of copies, and source of each document entering the procedure.
      1.13.3.2. The method of preparation, organizational element, and person preparing each docu-
      ment originating in the procedure.
      1.13.3.3. A symbol, with a short explanation to show each step in the procedure.
      1.13.3.4. Processing times and movement distances (optional).
      1.13.3.5. Final disposition of each copy of each document involved in the procedure.
   1.13.4. Figure 1.3. shows common chart symbols and their uses.

           Origination: When a new document is created.



           Operation: When some physical operation on the document is performed.



           Move: When a document changes location or personnel.


           Delay: When a document is idle.


           File: When a document is placed in or removed from a formally organized file.


           Inspection: When a mental verification process is performed.


           Information Take-Off: When data is moved from one document to another.


           Destroy: When a document is destroyed.


           Gap: To omit activity not pertinent to the study.


           Cross Over: To show that a document has taken a non-intersecting horizontal.


           Item Change: To show that a document has taken on a different meaning.

  1.13.5. Preparing a procedures chart starts with completing a narrative that describes the work being
  done in step form, who is doing the work, and where it is being done.
     1.13.5.1. Chart preparation begins with entering basic information on the chart such as: Procedure
     Title, Data, and Analyst.
     1.13.5.2. All charting starts in the upper left corner and goes down and across to the right on the
     chart. The personnel activity flow is always on the left side of the procedure chart. Vertical col-
     umns are drawn to keep apart each individual organizational element used on the chart.
     1.13.5.3. There is only one personnel column per chart, but there is a document column for each
     organizational element on the chart. Explanatory comment generally goes with each symbol.
     1.13.5.4. Use present tense with personnel symbols (what the person does) and use past tense
     (what is done to the document) with the document symbols.
     1.13.5.5. If pertinent to the study, give the estimated processing time after each document symbol
     and show the distance moved with each move symbol.
  1.13.6. Procedure charts are prepared on a DD Form 2050, Procedures Chart. Follow the rules in
  Figure 1.4. to prepare a procedure chart.
26                                                          AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


Figure 1.4. How to Prepare a Procedure Chart.

- A document can be introduced into a Procedure Chart in only three ways:




                      Origination




                      Gap (from outside the procedure area), or




                       File (removed from a formal file).



- When a document is introduced by                 origination, provide the following:

            Title (Form Number, if Any)



                                  Number of copies - Method of Preparation

            (1) For Example:


            Request for Personnel Action (SF 52)




                                 3 - copies - typed



- When documents are introduced from outside the procedural area, a                  gap symbol is used
in this manner.

           Title (Form Number, if Any) - Number of copies



                                 Organizational Source
           (1) For Example:
                      Request for Personnel Action (SF 52) - 3 copies



                                        Organizations Division
           (2) To introduce existing logs or registers:




- When documents are introduced into the procedure by removal from a formal file, the file symbol is
used as follows:
                         File Title



                                    Method of arrangement
           (1) For Example:
                        Contract File



                                    by contract number

     but used separately in the procedure:




     (3) Example of a document being used and immediately returned to the form file:

- When action on a document is delayed, the D Delay symbol is used in this manner.


           D Cause of Delay (except when in "In or Out Baskets" which is awaiting pickup.)

           (1) For Example, waiting in an “In Basket”;


                  SF 52



                          D "In Basket"


- The             operation symbol is perhaps one of the most used of all. Its use will cover any action
that can happen to a document for which there is not some other symbol.



- The             inspection symbol is used to indicate a mental verification process. The following are
typical examples.
           (1) Document checked against a mental standard.


                      SF 52



                                Reviewed

           (2) Document checked against materiel received.


                    Packing Slip



                               Checked against items received

          (3) Two documents matched by some common factor.




          (4) Two documents compared (proofed): One of the documents is the standard, and the other
           document will be changed if any discrepancy is found.




         (5) Repetition (verification) of an          operation.

                        Issue Slip




- The             Move symbol is used to show that the document has either changed personnel or phys-
ical location. The symbol will explain by noting how the paper moved and, if desired, the distance
moved as follows:

          (1) Document moves from one person to another.
                SF 52
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                      31


           (2) Document moves from one place to another (does not change persons):
                SF 52




           (3) Document moves horizontally across the chart to another organizational element:




- The             Item Changed symbol is used to indicate that a document has taken on a new signifi-
cance in the procedure. For Example:




- The          Information Take-Off symbol is used to indicate that information is moving from one
document to another for the completion of some action.


Typical examples are:
           (1) Origination of one document either wholly or partially from another:
32                                                          AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


           (2) Posting from one document to another:




           (3) Proofing (reading a source against the extract):




The             Cross Over symbol is used to show that a vertical and a horizontal flow line do not inter-
sect. The half-circle is always on the vertical line as follows:




- The              Gap symbol can also be used to show activity that is not pertinent to the study. It
should always explain differences in form, number, etc., of documents which enter the uncharted activity
and do not return or are altered during that time. For example:
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                     33


- Flowlines are the connecting links between symbols. The following rules apply in their use:
           (1) Solid flowlines go into the top of symbols and out of the bottom as follows:




           (2) An exception to the above is the          Move symbol. The flow line can be adjusted
           to show horizontal flow as follows:




          (3) No solid flow line can be left dangling. Each must end with a proper terminal symbol or
          the action is not completely charted.
34                                                        AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


          (4) Considerations regarding major flows and minor flows are important during analysis and
          presentation. This relationship is shown by always having the minor flow document move to
           join the major flow when they combine. For example:




         (5) All symbols fill the space between two guidelines on the chart form except the
         Item Change symbol which fills only half. If desired, symbols can be reduced to one half this
          size.
         (6) Each time a new vertical document flow line is begun, the contents of that flow should be
          listed. For example:


                (a) On a             Separation Operation:




                (b) On a horizontal move (from one organization to another):

- Often used combinations:
           (1) Reproduction of copies from a master document
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                             35


       (2) Telephone call. Only flow line which should be left dangling:




       (3) Short alternative courses of action:




       (4) Distribution of documents:
36                                                              AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


- All document flow lines must end with one of the three following terminal symbols:

          (1) The               Destroy symbol is used when a document is physically destroyed.

         (2) The              File symbol is used to show the intersection of a document into a formal file.

          (3) The             Gap symbol is used to show a document leaving the procedural area. It
          may go to a destination either in or outside the organization involved.


Section 1D—Work Distribution Analysis

1.14. General Concepts.
     1.14.1. Division of work is a potential area for productivity enhancement and is an aspect of skill
     determination for manpower standards.
     1.14.2. Work distribution analysis is a technique used to evaluate specific steps and find each individ-
     ual's contribution to work center activity. This technique is useful when the work center consists of
     several people and skills contributing to the same product or service.
     1.14.3. Work distribution analysis looks at work counts and man-hours associated with each respon-
     sibility.
     1.14.4. This technique is a good tool to check and compare present and proposed procedures during
     study familiarization and consultant studies.

1.15. How to Prepare a Work Distribution Chart.
     1.15.1. Preparing this chart takes three basic steps, and each step must be done accurately and in
     detail.
     1.15.2. First, have each person in the work center complete a DD Form 2030, Activity/Task List. Use
     this form to record each duty activity and type of work done and estimate the average number of hours
     spent on each.
        1.15.2.1. The DD Form 2030 does not merely quote an Air Force Specialty (AFS) or job classifi-
        cation statement. Use the task list to record a complete description of what each worker actually
        does. Do not include ambiguous phrases like "checking," "administration," or "make contacts."
        1.15.2.2. Number tasks by activity (Col. e) to help in developing a work distribution chart. The
        work unit volume (Col. d) will aid in work distribution analysis.
     1.15.3. The second step is to complete a work center DD Form 2030 for the activities. This list
     records the basic processes that are done by the work center. It includes all the major activities that are
     done to meet assigned objectives.
     1.15.4. The third step is preparing a DD Form 1724, Work Distribution Chart. The DD Form 2030
     gives the information needed to do the chart.
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                             37


      1.15.4.1. First, list the activity of the work center in the left column of the chart, in order of rela-
      tive importance. Leave space between each line.
      1.15.4.2. The columns headed "Tasks" are for listing the work done by each person. Complete a
      column for each person in the work center, listing each of the tasks in summary form. Relate each
      task to the activity list in the left column. Clearly separate the different tasks, since analysis is
      impossible if a miscellaneous task is placed on the same line as the major job or operation of the
      work center.
      1.15.4.3. For purpose of analysis, list individuals doing the activities in the first column by grade,
      beginning with the person in charge.
      1.15.4.4. Record the hours per week spent by each person on each task in the proper column.
      1.15.4.5. Enter work count data on the chart when relevant. If possible, enter the work count as
      the number per week to be consistent with hours shown on the DD Form 1724. If a weekly count
      is not representative, enter the natural frequency of occurrence (e.g., /MO or /YR).
      1.15.4.6. Sum the hours spent by all workers on each operation and enter the total in the column
      beside each item in the operation or process list.
      1.15.4.7. Total the hours for each person.

1.16. Work Distribution Analysis.
   1.16.1. After completing an initial work distribution chart, do a systematic analysis of the recorded
   findings. These questions help in examining the detail.
      1.16.1.1. Are skills being used properly? Is everyone being used in the best possible manner, or
      are special skills and abilities being wasted? Persons with higher skills should not do tasks that can
      be done by lower skill levels.
      1.16.1.2. Is work distributed evenly? Measure the relative importance of tasks assigned to persons
      engaged in similar tasks. For example, two clerks of equal ability and grade normally should be
      charged with similar volumes of work. Spread the urgent and important tasks as evenly as possible
      to make certain that all work is done according to schedule.
      1.16.1.3. Are tasks spread too thinly? Performances of the same task by many workers may mean
      duplication of effort. The assignment of a task to one person sets responsibility and enriches the
      job.
      1.16.1.4. Are individuals doing too many unrelated tasks? A large number of tasks in any one col-
      umn may show that the individual has too many different tasks. Greater efficiency results if work-
      ers are assigned related tasks.
      1.16.1.5. Are the work center’s efforts misdirected? Is the work center spending too much time on
      relatively unimportant operations or unnecessary work? Instances of misdirected effort are very
      often found in "miscellaneous" or "administrative" processes.
      1.16.1.6. Are there excessive supervision or consultation tasks? Resistance to delegation of
      authority can restrict creativity and cause unnecessary delays.
      1.16.1.7. What activities take the most time? Are they the ones that should take the most time?
      Normally, the largest total time is spent on what is considered the major activity in the organiza-
38                                                           AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


        tion. If the activity is a continuing one with several steps, the engineer may make a more detailed
        analysis by preparing a DD Form 1724. Circle such man-hour totals to mark them for future pro-
        cess analysis.
     1.16.2. The answers to the above questions help develop improvement proposals. Prepare a new
     responsibility chart or distribution chart that shows the recommended process and division of work.
     This will best display proposed changes and compare them with present procedures. Associated
     reductions in man-hour requirements should be displayed to support the change.

Section 1E—Histogram Chart

1.17. General Concepts. A Histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of a series of
quantitative observations. The graph is usually a bar chart showing how the same parameter, measured on
different components, is distributed within certain minimum and maximum limits. The histogram is con-
structed by dividing the range of a variable into equal intervals. A bar chart is then drawn showing how
many data are located in each of the intervals. A histogram provides information by means of the shape of
the distribution and the dispersion. See Figure 1.5..
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                            39


Figure 1.5. General View of a Histogram.




1.18. Procedures to Develop a Histogram.
   1.18.1. Count the number of samples (n) for the process you are analyzing and record the total counts.


       7.9   7.3    7.4   7.9 8.1       7.8    7.9   8.1    8.4    7.8    8.3    7.8
       7.3   7.8    7.5   8.2 7.9       7.8    7.4   7.0    7.7    7.8    7.3    7.7
       8.0   7.4    7.4   7.6 8.3       7.7    7.5   8.0    8.1    7.4    7.5    8.2
       7.5   8.3    7.7   7.8 8.0       7.5    7.9   8.0    7.7    8.4    7.6    7.7
       7.7   7.7    8.7   7.9 8.2       7.8    7.3   7.6    7.5    7.7    8.1    7.9
       7.7   7.8    8.3   7.9 7.7       7.8    7.4   8.1    8.1    8.1    7.2    8.2
       7.6   8.7    8.0   (n = 75)

   1.18.2. Identify the range (R) of data you have gathered. This number is the difference between the
   largest (XL) and smallest (Xs) value in the data. R = XL - XS = 8.7 - 7.0 = 1.7
      1.18.2.1. Separate the data into classes (K). Use this table to identify the number of classes for dif-
      ferent numbers of data points.
40                                                             AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


       Points Counted           Classes (K) To Use


       Less than 50                    5-7
           51 - 100                  6 - 10
         101 - 250                   7 - 12
          Over 250                  10 - 20


       1.18.2.2. Determine the width of each class (H) using the formula, H = R/K. Since the number of
       samples in the example is 75, use 10 as a convenient divisor. For the data used in this example, the
       class width is 1.7/10 = 0.17. After rounding to the nearest tenth, H = 0.20.
       1.18.2.3. Identify the boundaries for each of the classes in the Histogram. Begin with the value of
       XS, the smallest number in the range of counts, and add the class width H. Continue to add the
       class width until the number of classes selected in the example is reached. In this example, XS =
       7.0 as the lower boundary. Adding 0.20 yields the 1st class ranging from 7.0 to 7.20. The next
       class begins at 7.20 and extends to 7.40.
NOTE: To avoid having the same point as both the upper value of a class and the lower value of the next
class, decrease the upper value by the correct decimal. Therefore, in this example, the range of the 1st
class is from 7.0 < X < 7.2, the 2nd class from 7.20 < X < 7.40, etc.
       1.18.2.4. Identify the number of samples in each class to determine the frequency of occurrence
       and enable the construction of the Histogram. These counts give a horizontal Histogram.


        Class             Number of Counts             Total


        7.00 - 7.19       /                            1
        7.20 - 7.39       /////                        5
        7.40 - 7.59       ///// ///// //               12
        7.60 - 7.79       ///// ///// /////            15
        7.80 - 7.99       ///// ///// ///// ///        18
        8.00 - 8.19       ///// ///// //               12
        8.20 - 8.39       ///// ///                    8
        8.40 - 8.59       //                           2
        8.60 - 8.79       //                           2


                                                  n = 75

       1.18.2.5. Construct the Histogram to show the samples in each class for this example. The data in
       this example is centered around a value of 7.90 and is very close to a bell shaped curve. The His-

      togram gives a view of where the counts are centered and the amount of dispersion of the data. See
      Figure 1.6..

Figure 1.6. Histogram of Data.




   1.18.3. The data in a Histogram will not always be symmetrical as depicted in the example. The data
   could be tightly centered around a point or greatly dispersed, or even bi-modal (having two distinct
   clusters around separated frequencies) potentially indicating two separate populations under study. In
   each case, evaluating the results of the chart furnishes useful information about the event or process
   being analyzed. See Figure 1.7..
   1.18.4. Be aware of twin or multiple peaks. Their appearance indicates that the data is coming from
   two or more different sources. If this is the case stratify the data so that the histogram uses only one
   data source.

Section 1F—Pareto Chart

1.19. General Concepts. A Pareto chart identifies the problems that should be solved first in terms of
complaints, defects or cost. The Pareto chart is useful because it shows the areas that are experiencing the
most problems and should be addressed first for correction. See Figure 1.8..
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                            43


Figure 1.8. Pareto Chart.




1.20. Procedures to Construct a Pareto Chart.
   1.20.1. Determine what factor (cost, defects, etc.) you want to use to evaluate different processes. The
   samples for this factor are itemized into the processes you'll evaluate. For example, if errors are occur-
   ring in a supply organization you can evaluate the number of errors in the processes of Receiving,
   Shipping, Storage, Delivery, etc. For documentation and validation purposes, specify the source of all
   counts.
   1.20.2. Select a period of time to evaluate. The time period can range anywhere from a day, week,
   month, quarter to years. The samples for each process evaluated should come from the same time
   period for meaningful evaluation.
   1.20.3. Draw horizontal and vertical axis for the diagram. The processes are listed along the horizon-
   tal line. The samples for the factor being evaluated are scaled on the left vertical axis. Values of 0 to
   100% are scaled along the right vertical axis.
   1.20.4. Total the samples for each process and use bars to represent the process. The process with the
   largest total of samples is placed first on the far left. The remaining processes are entered, ranging
   from those with the largest samples to the smallest. If several processes each have few samples, they
   can be combined and identified as other.
   1.20.5. Use a line to show the cumulative total when adding each additional process. The line goes
   from the tallest bar to the right and up until it reaches the right axis at the 100% point.
   1.20.6. Usually, the tallest bars indicate the largest contributors to the overall problem. Dealing with
   these areas first is logical. However, most frequent doesn’t necessarily equate to most important.

1.21. How to Use a Pareto Chart. Use care when selecting the factor to evaluate different processes as
potential candidates for problem solution. Using total defects can show one process as a potential candi-
date. But, by selecting cost of defects, a different process may show a larger impact. When a change is
made to a process as a solution to a problem, draw another Pareto chart after operating under the new pro-
cess and check if the process has decreased in relation to the other processes evaluated.

Section 1G—Scatter Diagram

1.22. General Concepts. The scatter diagram shows the relationship between two variables. The rela-
tionship is termed correlation or the influence one variable has on the other. The variables could come
from the potential workload factors of a standard study, a cause-and-effect diagram, or any other source
generating variables. The diagram is composed of an x-axis and y-axis. The effected variable is placed on
the y-axis and the cause variable is placed on the x-axis.

1.23. Procedures to Develop a Scatter Diagram.
     1.23.1. Draw a scatter diagram by collecting the data to plot the samples. The individual samples are
     formed by the intersection of the (x,y) values.
     1.23.2. Collect 50 to 100 (x,y) data pairs that will form the samples on the diagram. See Figure 1.9.
     for a partial listing of point pairs.

     1.23.3. Draw and label the x-axis and y-axis.
     1.23.4. Plot the individual samples on the scatter diagram. If samples overlap, place concentric circles
     around the point, with a circle representing each additional point. See Figure 1.10. for an example of
     how to plot the samples and a scatter diagram.

1.24. How to Interpret a Scatter Diagram. After the samples are plotted on the chart, observe if one
variable affects the other. See Figure 1.11. for a variety of possible results.

Figure 1.11. Scatter Diagram Outcomes.




     1.24.1. If, as one variable increases in value the other also increases, there is a positive relationship or
     correlation. The closer the samples are to an imaginary line extending from the lower to the higher

   samples the stronger is the impact of one variable on the other. The more dispersed the samples from
   the imaginary line the weaker the relationship.
   1.24.2. The diagram indicating No Correlation shows the data points scattered all over the diagram.
   There is no indication of a distinguishable impact of one variable on the other.
   1.24.3. The diagram indicating Negative Correlation shows as one variable increases in value, the
   other decreases. As with Positive Correlation, the closer the samples are to an imaginary line extend-
   ing from the lower to the higher samples, the stronger the impact of one variable on the other.

Section 1H—Cause-and-Effect Diagram

1.25. General Concepts. A cause-and-effect diagram (also known as an Ishikawa Diagram) is used not
only to identify a potential problem but also to analyze it as well. Any problem can have many possible
causes. The cause-and-effect diagram allows the user to identify potential causes of a problem in logical
groups depending on the problem type. The primary factors that cause a product or service quality prob-
lem usually relate to unwanted changes in manpower, work processes, equipment, or raw materials. To
find the elements that come into play, follow a logical approach to identify the potential causes of a prob-
lem. Figure 1.12. illustrates the structure of a cause-and-effect diagram.

Figure 1.12. Cause-and-Effect Diagram.




1.26. Procedures to Develop a Cause-and-Effect Diagram.
   1.26.1. Identify what the problem is and briefly state it on the right side of the diagram. Enclose this
   statement in a box. Draw an arrow towards the problem statement extending to the left.
48                                                            AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


     1.26.2. Identify the major categories of causes that potentially could cause the problem. Connect
     these categories to the line pointing to the problem statement.
     1.26.3. List the factors in each of these categories that could cause the problem, using an idea gener-
     ating methodology such as the Nominal Group Technique or Brainstorming. Each of these branches
     can have branches identifying more specific causes of the stated problem. See Figure 1.13. for an
     example of this branching.

Figure 1.13. Detailed Listing of Causes.




     1.26.4. A very important element of identifying the potential causes of a stated problem is to have
     personnel that are familiar with the needs for completing the product or service. If a knowledgeable
     group of people is present, a very detailed breakdown of potential causes can be identified. If the per-
     sonnel are not familiar with the processes or needs, then too generalized a listing of potential causes
     could result. See Figure 1.14..

1.27. Benefits of Using a Cause-and-Effect Diagram.
     1.27.1. Any type of problem can be displayed on a cause-and-effect diagram. It doesn't have to relate
     to quality or timeliness. For example, personnel, safety, and scheduling problems can also be analyzed
     using this diagram.
     1.27.2. The level of knowledge about the factors that influence the problem is soon evident by the
     level of detailed breakdown of the potential causes of the problem. The more branches to the causes
     the greater the depth of knowledge of the personnel generating the causes.
     1.27.3. The cause-and-effect diagram allows the participants to visually focus on the various catego-
     ries of causes that could impact a problem. This makes it easier for the group to focus on generating
     potential causes.
     1.27.4. All personnel participating in the analysis gain from the interaction of ideas produced in the
     group. This interaction not only serves the purpose of generating ideas for solving a problem, but also
     aids in educating the participants about the various factors that impact the problem being addressed.

Section 1I—Control Chart

1.28. General Concepts. A control chart is an effective tool for determining if samples come from the
same population and if the variation between samples is sufficiently small to allow the use of the mean as
the sole descriptive statistic of the population.
     1.28.1. Control charts (see Figure 1.15.) give important graphical information that can help deter-
     mine where variation in a process might be normal or abnormal with the latter case requiring further
     analysis. By plotting the sample points in time order (the sequence in which they occurred), control
     charts can identify unusual changes in the process indicating the need for further analysis. There are
     several distinct data patterns that indicate whether we should explore data to include in our analysis -
     these patterns are shown in Figure 1.18.
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                            51


Figure 1.15. Examples of a Control Chart.




   1.28.2. There are two main types of control charts - for attributes data and for variables data. Attribute
   control charts are used to plot "go" or "no-go" factors such as an output being in or out of tolerance.
   Variable control charts plot specific measurements of a variable characteristic such as size, time, or
   weight of an output.

1.29. Description of Terms.
   1.29.1. Assignable Cause. Any force/situation, not deemed part of the defined population that causes
   a sample to deviate significantly (exceeding established control limits) from the mean. For example,
   we may define a certain population of proportions as being "the level of daily productivity associated
   with the production of 40 to 60 units." If one day's productivity exceeded the Upper Control Limit
   (UCL) and the associated workload was 75 units, we'd know some force, not inherent to the defined
   population, was at work.
   1.29.2. Common Cause. A host of small, independent, and elusive forces that act on events or mea-
   surements. Chance is normally responsible for the unassignable variation between elements of a pop-
   ulation.
   1.29.3. Observation. The selection of one element of a population.
   1.29.4. Population. Any set of objects that we may care to define. Each member of a population is
   called an element.
   1.29.5. Range. The difference between the highest and lowest value of any set of elements or obser-
   vations.
52                                                               AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


     1.29.6. Sample. In this context, sample is assumed to be a random sample. A random sample is the
     selection of one or more elements of a population - each element having the same probability of being
     selected.
     1.29.7. Sample Size (n). A sample may consist of one or more observations - the number of observa-
     tions is the size of the sample. For example: 23 (sample size is 1); 23, 27, 22, 21 (sample size is 4); and
     20, 22 (sample size is 2).

     1.29.8. Standard Deviation. The square root of the variance. The formula is s =
     1.29.9. Variance (s2 ). The average of the squared deviation from the mean. It's written as .
                                 Use n-1 when the sample size is 30 or less. The formula is



     s2 =


1.30. Control Chart Description. Descriptive statistics enable us to compile information in numerical
form about populations. Two characteristics of populations lend themselves to numerical description - the
central tendency and the dispersion of populations. By combining a visual representation of data with
numerical descriptions, control charts enable us to make a visual and numerical analysis of the population.
     1.30.1. A control chart is a graph with a centerline, upper and lower control limits (LCL), and sample
     points. The center line is usually the average (central tendency) of the samples. The control limits are
     the expected limits of the population based on the number of samples and their dispersion. The most
     used measure of central tendency is the mean and the measure of dispersion is the standard deviation.
     Control limits are determined by adding and subtracting one or more standard deviations from the
     mean (see Figure 1.15.). They are derived mathematically by sampling data from the process. In Fig-
     ure 1.15., the process is within specifications, but it's not stable. To meet the customer's needs, all pro-
     cess samples should be within the UCL and LCL. The variation displayed in the chart can be
     decreased further by improving the process used to furnish the product or service to the customer.
     1.30.2. The normal curve (see Figure 1.16.) has 68.3% of the data points falling within one standard
     deviation (plus or minus) from the mean; 95.5% of the data points fall within two standard deviations
     from the mean; and 99.7% of the data points fall within three standard deviations. Construct a control
     chart to display data samples using the steps outlined below.
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                   53

           1.30.2.4.1. Add three standard deviations to the process average (mean) for the zone limits 1,
           2, and 3 above the center line.
           1.30.2.4.2. Subtract three standard deviations from the process average for the limits 1, 2, and

       control chart. See Figure 1.17..

       1.30.2.6. Plot and connect the sample data points.
       1.30.2.7. Analyze the data by looking for out-of-control and unnatural conditions.
   1.30.3. If samples are within three standard deviations, analyze their variation to determine if the
   mean can be used as the sole descriptive statistic of the population. Some populations have such broad
   limits that the mean alone has little value as a description of the population. Observe how the standard
   deviation compares to the size of the mean. If the standard deviation is small compared to the mean,
   the mean can be used as the sole descriptive statistic of the population.

1.31. Analyzing Control Charts. After building a control chart and plotting the data on it, analyze what
the data is saying about the process. As mentioned earlier, if the data on the control chart forms a normal
curve (natural pattern), the points will fluctuate at random and settle around the mean (center line). A few
points may fall near the control limits (UCL, LCL), but none of the points should exceed the control lim-
56                                                              AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


its. A normal curve shows there is a steady, stable process that is not being disturbed by assignable causes
from outside the process.
     1.31.1. If one of the data points exceeds the UCL or falls below the LCL, the process is "out-of-con-
     trol". When this condition exists, investigate the process to identify the cause of the variation and cor-
     rect it. Assignable causes of variation (e.g., machine out of alignment, fatigued worker, etc.) can be
     corrected bringing the process back into control.
     1.31.2. When the correction or adjustment for assignable cause is made, the process variation should
     resume its normal distribution pattern between the UCL and LCL of the control chart. This normal
     amount of variation (normal distribution) is due to common causes of variation. Common causes of
     variation, unlike assignable causes, cannot be entirely eliminated from a process. However, manage-
     ment can take action to improve the overall process and reduce the amount of variation due to com-
     mon causes by setting up process action teams, or providing training.
     1.31.3. Having data points fall outside of the control limits is not the only indicator of an out-of-con-
     trol condition. Data that fluctuates too widely or fails to fall around the mean can be classified as
     unnatural patterns of variation. An unnatural pattern usually shows that an abnormal condition is
     occurring or beginning to occur in the process. It needs to be investigated as a problem source or area
     of concern. There are several types of unnatural patterns of variation (see Figure 1.18.).
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                           57


Figure 1.18. Examples of Unnatural Patterns of Variation.




      1.31.3.1. Cycles. A short trend in the data that occurs in a repeated pattern where the pattern
      becomes predictable or systematic. This is an indication of an assignable cause because a charac-
      teristic of a normal (random) pattern is that it does not repeat. A cycle is caused by a process vari-
      able that comes and goes on a regular basis.
      1.31.3.2. Instability. Is identified by wholly erratic fluctuations that go beyond the control limits
      or show erratic upward and downward movement.

        1.31.3.3. Mixture. A pattern that falls near the control limits with an absence of points near the
        center line. This pattern is more commonly known as the "sawtooth" effect. A mixture is actually
        a combination of two different populations on the same chart.
        1.31.3.4. Trends. A series of points showing a steady change in one direction, either up or down
        the control chart. Even if there is up and down movement of successive points, if the general direc-
        tion of the points exhibit either an upward or downward movement, it can also be considered a
        trend.
     1.31.4. There are some other out-of-control or abnormal condition indicators. They each show that
     something unusual is happening in the process that needs to be investigated (see Figure 1.19.).

Figure 1.19. Abnormal Data Point Occurrences.




        1.31.4.1. Two out of three successive points in Zone 3, on the same side of the center line.
        1.31.4.2. Four out of five successive points in Zone 2 or beyond, on the same side of the center
        line.
        1.31.4.3. Nine successive points on one side of the center line.
     1.31.5. After building the control chart, plotting the data points, and interpreting the results, if no out
     of control conditions are found, the process is considered in control and free of assignable causes of
     variation. Continue using control charts to monitor the process and make sure it stays in control. Con-
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                             59


   centrate your efforts on reducing the common (random) causes of variation. This is how to achieve
   continuous improvement in a process.
   1.31.6. This brief introduction on control charts with respect to their construction and use, gives
   enough information to allow us to look at some specific types of control charts. The number of sam-
   ples used in each example shouldn't be considered to be a "sufficient" number for analysis. Strong
   analyses and conclusions depend on many more samples than used in the examples.

1.32. Control Charts for Attribute Data. Attribute data are usually obtained by counting the number of
items in one of two categories; e.g., go or no-go, pass or fail. For example, a light bulb either lights up or
it doesn't light. In attributes data, the item either has the characteristic or it doesn't.
   1.32.1. Attribute control charts are useful in analyzing factors such as effectiveness, efficiency, docu-
   ment errors, reducing backlog and other forms of manpower analysis. These charts are useful when
   there are many processes to monitor. There are basically four types of attribute control charts: two
   types count the number of nonconforming parts or items, and two types count the number of noncon-
   formities on a particular part or item.
       1.32.1.1. The two types of attribute control charts that count nonconforming parts or items are the
       NP and the P-Charts. The NP-Chart plots the number of nonconforming parts or items in a sample
       and is used when the sample size is constant (5 items repaired each day). The P-Chart plots the
       percentage of nonconforming parts or items and is used when the sample size varies (15 items on
       day 1, 20 items on day 2, 25 items on day 3, etc.).
       1.32.1.2. The two types of attribute control charts that count the number of nonconformities on a
       particular part or item are the C-Chart and the U-Chart. The C-Chart plots the number of noncon-
       formities per sample and is used when the sample size is constant. The U-Chart plots the number
       of nonconformities per individual unit and is used when the sample size varies such as comparing
       documents that differ in size.
   1.32.2. Using a P-Chart. The P-Chart should be used when it's necessary to determine if sample pro-
   portions come from the same population. For example, we use the P-Chart in work sampling to ana-
   lyze the stability of daily productivity (the daily ratio of productive time to available or assigned
   time); and we can use the P-Chart to determine what proportion of a given number of items we can
   expect to be effective. The latter use is valuable if a work center's output is produced by defective
   items; we can take samples of the items, plot the sample proportions of defective items to total items,
   evaluate the P-Chart, and arrive at a reasonable conclusion about the stability of the mean and disper-
   sion of the population. As an example, let's analyze the proportions of defective widgets produced at
   an Air Force base. There are 800 widgets produced each day of the study (n = 800).

      1.32.2.5. Analyze the control chart.
   1.32.3. Using a C-Chart. Another type of control chart for attribute data is the C-Chart. The letter c
   denotes the number of defects per item or group of items. The c symbol (c-bar) represents the mean
   number of defects. The standard deviation of the population is estimated by the square root of c.
      1.32.3.1. Use the C-Chart when these two conditions are present: first, the average number of
      defects are far less than could occur if everything went wrong; and second, the area of opportunity
      for defects is the same. The latter condition means that when you group elements, always use the
      same number of elements per group.
      1.32.3.2. As an example, let's analyze the number of defects per group of five ARC-34s bench
      checked by the personnel of a Com/Nav work center. We meet the conditions described above
      because each group of five ARC-34s bench checked have considerably fewer defects than they

     tunity.

1.33. Control Charts for Measurement Data. Measurement data are recorded observations of the
extent or amount of a characteristic associated with a given element or group of elements. Some funda-
mental characteristics are length, weight, and time. Workload data such as units produced, sorties flown,
or items received can also be considered measurement data. The two types of variables control charts used
in quality improvement are the X (X-bar) and R charts. The bar above the X means an average is used and
the chart is called an "X-bar" chart. The R stands for range. The X charts are created separately but are
used together since they each measure a different aspect of the process. The chart plots the average or

mean of measurements in a sample. The R chart plots the range or variation of measurements in the sam-
ple.
     1.33.1. Typical X-bar and R charts are shown in Figure 1.22.. They include basic elements common
     to all control charts; i.e., the mean (center line), UCL and LCL. The X and R control charts are often
     used, since they give more information on the variation within a process than the charts that measure
     attributes. Figure 1.22. shows a fairly stable process. All the points are within the calculated control
     limits and move in a random pattern.

     1.33.2. If the plotted values of X and R fall on or above the UCL, or fall on or below the LCL, an
     unexpected event has occurred and should be investigated. It might be due to worn machine parts,

  deviating from accepted methods of processing, a change in material, or fatigue on the part of the
  worker.
  1.33.3. Constructing an X Chart. The steps in constructing an X chart are:
     1.33.3.1. Collect the data.
     1.33.3.2. Compute the mean. Each mean is the sum of the measurements for the sampling period
     (i.e., daily, weekly, etc.) divided by the number of measurements taken during the sampling
     period.
     1.33.3.3. Compute the range, or R for each data point. For each sample, the range is determined
     by subtracting the smallest value from the largest value.
     1.33.3.4. Compute the center line (mean) for each chart. Add all the values of the X data and
     divide by the number of X data points. Each sample size should be the same size. Do the same for
     the R data points.
     1.33.3.5. Compute the control limits (UCL, LCL) for each chart (X and R) by using the formulas
     that apply. (See Table 1.1.)
     1.33.3.6. Draw the x (horizontal) axis and y (vertical) axis for each chart. Mark the scale on the
     x-axis of each chart. (The distance between the control limits on the X chart is roughly similar to
     the control limits of the R chart.)
     1.33.3.7. Draw the X and R center lines and draw the control limits for each chart.
     1.33.3.8. Plot the X and R values on the chart.
     1.33.3.9. Analyze the control charts.
  1.33.4. Using the X and Range Charts. These steps show the development of an X chart and R chart
  for five weeks of daily numbers of work orders completed. (See Table 1.2. for constant values A2
  ,D3,& D4)

       1.33.5.1. The main advantage of the X and R chart is that it gives specific data about a single char-
       acteristic of a product or process that gives clues on how to isolate a particular problem.
       1.33.5.2. A disadvantage of the X and R chart is that, if used to measure products or processes that
       have many variables, many charts are needed (One for each variable that is considered important).
       This can be very costly, so the X and R control charts are often used together with attributes con-
       trol charts.

1.34. When To Use Control Charts. Deciding when to use control charts and which type to use isn't
always easy. It's not economical nor is there enough time to chart every variable for every process. There-
fore, determine which key areas or characteristics of a process really need to be monitored and concen-
trate on them. Take these steps:
   1.34.1. Flow chart the process. Identify the key areas or elements.
   1.34.2. Select the key areas or elements to monitor. Focus your efforts to prevent defects rather than
   just detecting them.
   1.34.3. Select the pertinent control chart and determine the sample size. Then begin collecting data.
   1.34.4. Construct a control chart and analyze the information.
   1.34.5. Continue monitoring the process. Constantly seek ways to reduce assignable and random
   causes of variation.
   1.34.6. Periodically reevaluate how closely you need to monitor the process using the control chart
   selected and the results being achieved. If there is too much variation in the process, work on improv-
   ing it and eventually providing increased customer service and satisfaction.

Section 1J—Group Ware

1.35. Group Ware.
   1.35.1. Recently a technology has become available which can support and enhance the traditional
   workshop data collection process. “Group Ware” is a term used to describe technology which inte-
   grates multiple computers so that communication, data collection, and decision making can be accom-
   plished more efficiently. Familiar Group Ware tools include e-mail, conference call, video
   teleconferences, while less familiar Group Ware programs may be online (Internet-based) brainstorm-
   ing tools or software-based data collection and consensus tools used in traditional face-to-face meet-
   ings.
   1.35.2. Several types of Group Ware meeting options are possible, based on the time and location of
   participant involvement.
       1.35.2.1. Synchronous/Face-to-face: Participants are working at the same time, in the same loca-
       tion (e.g., meeting room).
       1.35.2.2. Synchronous/Distributed. Participants are working at the same time, but are located in
       different places. Imagine brainstorming with people located all over the world, and all of your
       inputs are showing up on everyone else’s computer screens immediately.
       1.35.2.3. Asynchronous. Participants are making their inputs at different times (e.g., whenever
       their schedules permit, over the course of a week), typically done in a distributed manner.
72                                                           AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


     1.35.3. These consensus tools (both Internet-based and in face-to-face environments) potentially offer
     the most promise. An example of a face-to-face Group Ware system would be a conference room
     where each participant has his or her own computer which is networked to all the others by a server.
     The individual respondents enter their respective data, ideas, opinions, or comments, and this infor-
     mation is combined as appropriate for decision making, and presented to the group for discussion. The
     benefits of Group Ware workshops of this type are:
        1.35.3.1. Cost savings. Recently, many Group Ware products have been made Internet-ready, so
        that actual meetings or data collection (part of a meeting) can be conducted on-line with partici-
        pants from anywhere in the world. Obviously, travel costs can be greatly reduced. Many organiza-
        tions use such a capability for collecting data prior to workshops, such as having participants
        complete on-line surveys, brainstorm, prioritize, vote, or make comments using this Internet inter-
        face, so that the group’s information is consolidated and summarized when the traditional work-
        shop begins.
        1.35.3.2. Increased anonymity. Respondent ideas can be contributed for group discussion without
        the author being identified. The group addresses the content of the submitted idea, without much
        of the personality or rank dynamic present in open brainstorming.
        1.35.3.3. Increased speed of data collection and analysis. Rather than verbally commenting one
        person at a time (often allowing more “vocal” or “aggressive” individuals to monopolize the
        time), a Group Ware workshop lets people contribute their perspective simultaneously (through
        the keyboard). Substantially more information can be collected in the same amount of time as tra-
        ditional open discussion. Additionally, the computer involvement allows for immediate documen-
        tation and calculations to be performed, eliminating much of the administrative burden of the
        workshop. The group can get to the point of discussion much faster and have an automatic running
        log of the data and decision points reached by the group.
        1.35.3.4. More control over the workshop. The Group Ware programs often restrict participants
        from drifting away from the workshop agenda or topic by controlling what they are working on
        and the way they can input data. Likewise, statistical analysis is usually available in Group Ware
        programs that “flags” data which meets a criteria set by the meeting owner, such as low level of
        consensus by the group or data points which exceed a certain standard deviation.
     1.35.4. With some level of technical insight and effort, traditional desktop programs can be net-
     worked together to create a Group Ware platform. For example, AFMIA has developed an Excel pro-
     gram for collecting PAT and Frequency data from a group of people by networking computers and
     creating “macros” which automatically consolidate the inputs. Other more “off the shelf” programs
     are designed to consolidate multiple inputs, but are less “manpower focused,” which may or may not
     be an issue.
     1.35.5. In all cases, this technology requires adequate planning and competency to implement. The
     cost savings, time savings, increased buy-in, and better documentation are all very valuable outcomes,
     but they will not be achieved if the tool is not properly understood and utilized.

                             DATA ANALYSIS AND COMPUTATIONS

Section 2A—Correlation and Regression (C&R) Analysis

2.1. General Concepts.
   2.1.1. There are many uses for C&R analysis in the MEP. Some of these are the selection of workload
   factors and the development of man-hour equations, functional estimating equations, and functional
   models.
   2.1.2. Before starting C&R, verify the accuracy of the input data and purge it of any collection errors.
   The use of previously discussed techniques, such as control charts and scattergrams, will aid you in
   determining if data is good and logical. The end result of C&R is only as good as the data it's based on.
   2.1.3. Although correlation and regression are separate processes, they are usually done together.
   Regression statistics yield the equation and correlation statistics tell how good the equation is.
   2.1.4. Use C&R to evaluate the mathematical relationship between variables. Regression results in a
   linear or curvilinear equation that can be used for prediction purposes. For example, suppose that the
   number of line items processed in a base supply activity affects the number of man-hours needed in
   that function. The man-hours can then be expressed as a mathematical function of the number of line
   items processed.

2.2. Equation Forms.
   2.2.1. Introduction to Equation Forms. A mathematical equation provides useful information about
   the relationship between varying levels of workloads and measured man-hours. The equation can be
   used to predict man-hours. There are various forms the equation can take. Each form has a dependent
   variable (Y). This is the variable you are trying to predict. Y usually stands for man-hours. Each form
   also has one or more independent variable (X or Xs), that are used to help predict the dependent vari-
   able. X usually stands for workload. The equations also have a set number of coefficients (a, b1, b2, ...,
   bn) that are developed with regression analysis. Commonly used equation forms and their individual
   characteristics follow.
   2.2.2. Linear Equation. The most direct relationship between two variables is the linear equation Y =
   a + bX. This equation shows a constant slope (b) in a line. A linear equation has two coefficients, "a"
   and "b", to be estimated with regression.
   2.2.3. Parabolic Equation. A relationship between two variables that allows for a change in the way X
   is influencing Y can be represented by a parabola, Y = a + bX + cX². This allows the straight line, Y
   = a + bX, to curve up if the value of c is positive, or down if the value of c is negative. This equation
   form has three coefficients (a, b, and c) that will be estimated with regression analysis.
   2.2.4. Multivariate Equation.
      2.2.4.1. The equation form for two independent variables is Y = a + b1X1 + b2X2; for three vari-
      ables, Y = a + b1X1 + b2X2 + b3X3; and for any number (n) of variables, Y = a + b1X1 + b2X2 … +
      bnXn.
74                                                             AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


        2.2.4.2. Each coefficient (b-value) of the individual independent variables represents an amount
        of influence from its corresponding X-variable given that all of the other independent variables
        (Xs) are held at a constant value. For example, the coefficient for X1 in the equation Y = a + b1Xl
        would not be the same as the coefficient estimated for the same X1 in the equation Y = a + b1X1 +
        b2X2.
        2.2.4.3. Negative values for the coefficients may occur even when correlation between the depen-
        dent variables is positive. This may occur due to multicollinearity explained in paragraph 2.2.4.4..
        Negative b-values are acceptable, providing they pass the t-test of significance that shows if a par-
        ticular independent variable should be included in the model.
        2.2.4.4. Sometimes two or more of the independent variables are highly correlated. This is called
        multicollinearity. In such situations, these independent variables add similar information to the
        model. Since the model is used for prediction, don't do anything if the correlation between the
        independent variables continues into the future.
     2.2.5. Special Equation Forms.
        2.2.5.1. The two special curvilinear forms are the ratio and power. Use them with caution. Each
        restricts the prediction line through the origin and can unduly influence the form of the line. These
        forms must meet the same statistical criteria as for the linear and parabola.
            2.2.5.1.1. Ratio. This is a hyperbolic curve, Y = X/(a + bX), that requires the dependent vari-
            able (Y) of a line, to be transformed to (X/Y). Convert the ratio to a linear form by taking the
            reciprocal of both sides of the equation and then multiply each side by X. The resulting equa-
            tion is X/Y = a + bX.
            2.2.5.1.2. Power. This is an exponential curve, Y = aXb, that requires both the dependent and
            independent variables to be transformed. Transform the equation by taking the log of each
            side. The resulting equation becomes log Y = log a + b(log X).
        2.2.5.2. While the ratio and power curves are legitimate mathematical forms, they cannot be
        directly compared statistically to the linear and parabolic forms because of the transformations
        involved. Transformation changes the distributional properties that the statistical tests are based
        upon. Therefore, use these models with caution. Use a special equation form when:
            2.2.5.2.1. A parabola fits the data better than a linear equation, and the apex is within the data
            range. One of the special curved equation forms may represent the data in the same manner as
            the parabola but without an apex.
            2.2.5.2.2. A parabola fits the data better than a linear equation, and the apex is just outside the
            data range. The parabola in this case restricts the utility of the standard and should not be used.
            However, one of the special curve forms may fit the data almost as well and give an acceptable
            extrapolation range.
        2.2.5.3. No-Intercept Equation. In situations where the range of the observed data is near zero, the
        use of a no-intercept model (Y = bX) can be supported statistically. The intercept (a) from a linear
        equation must not be significantly different from zero for a no-intercept from to be used.

2.3. Regression Analysis.

      2.3.1. Least Squares Criteria. The regression technique used in the MEP is based on the "least
      squares" criterion for determining the equation (Yc) that best fits the observed data (Y). This method
      estimates the regression coefficients (a, b1, b2, ... bn) of the general equation Yc = b1x1 + b2x2…bkxk in
      such a manner as to guarantee the quantity å(Y-Yc)² is minimized—hence, the name "least squares"
      regression..
      2.3.2. Specific Terms. Specific terms are used in regression analysis. Figure 2.1. shows the relation-
      ship between the equation forms and the regression analysis terms.

  transformation)

      2.3.3. The Dependent Variable. In regression analysis, the dependent variable is the variable of inter-
      est. The notation for this is "Y." Most commonly in the MEP, the dependent variable is man-hours.
      However, it could be any type of measurement about which a prediction is needed. Measured
      man-hours for the dependent variable are usually costly to get. Therefore, try to find a relationship
      with a more easily obtainable variable that can be used to predict the dependent variable without mea-
      surement.
      2.3.4. The Independent Variable. Independent variables mathematically change with the dependent
      variable. Therefore, they can be used to predict the dependent variable. Notation for the independent
      variable is "X." These can either be the actual measurements of the independent variable or a transfor-
      mation of the independent variable, for example, X², log X, 1/X, or X.
      2.3.5. Regression Coefficients. Regression coefficients are the values resulting from regression anal-
      ysis and are used to form the regression equation. In the general equation form,
76                                                              AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


     Y = a + b1X1 + b2X2 + ... + bkxk, there are m regression coefficients (where m = k + 1). The m-coeffi-
     cients (a, b1, b2, ..., bk) include the "b" coefficients for the independent variables, as well as the "a,"
     that is the Y-intercept.
     2.3.6. Regression Analysis Assumptions.
        2.3.6.1. The form of the equation is linear with respect to the coefficients (b). This still allows for
        the transformation of the independent variables (X) into a power (X²), reciprocal (1/X), or log X
        as needed for an equation form.
        2.3.6.2. The values of the independent variables can be measured with little or no variability.
        2.3.6.3. The residuals are defined as the difference between the observed and calculated
        man-hours (Y-Yc). Assumptions regarding residuals follow.
            2.3.6.3.1. Residuals are independent of each other.
            2.3.6.3.2. Residuals are normally distributed and have the same variance regardless of the
            value of the independent variable.
     2.3.7. Single Location Regression Analysis. Use time series regression when multiple data sets can be
     obtained by one of these methods.
        2.3.7.1. Use historical data when reliable monthly man-hour and workload accounting records
        exist. Regress a minimum of 6 months, preferably 12 months, historical man-hour data against
        monthly workload data for each of the monthly periods. An example is a base that has accurate
        reporting systems for flying hours (X) and productive man-hours (Y). Use the historical data for
        the past year to get an equation that relates flying hours to productive man-hours. Evaluate the
        equation with the R² and V criteria, and the F-test. Figure 2.2. shows an example of this use of
        regression analysis.

             R2 = .755                                      30.964 > 4.96


             V = .069                                       therefore, it passes the F-test
      2.3.7.2. The second way to get multiple data sets is to set up a collection cycle to gather the nec-
      essary measurement data over a given time period.

2.4. Number of Input Points.
   2.4.1. The number of input points in regression analysis becomes important in testing the significance
   of the regression line. To have a meaningful test, there should be enough inputs to allow a good esti-
   mation of the variability within the data after the coefficients are estimated.

     2.4.2. Using only the statistic R² (coefficient of determination) as a measure of “goodness” can be
     misleading when the number of coefficients is very near the number of input data sets. Mathemati-
     cally, any number of points can be fit exactly with enough coefficients in the equation. For example,
     three points fit exactly an equation with three coefficients (Y = a + bX + cX²), thus producing R² = 1.
     2.4.3. Input points are needed for regression analysis.
        2.4.3.1. When the total number of locations is two, three, or four, it is a small population. Measure
        all locations. Statistical tests (F-test and t-test) are not needed.
        2.4.3.2. When the total population consists of five or more locations, use the minimum number of
        inputs, outlined in AFMAN 38-208, Volume 1, Table 3.4, as a guide and get one or two more if
        possible.
        2.4.3.3. In regression analysis, statistical tests are based on (n-1) and (n-m), called degrees of free-
        dom. The total number of observations or data points is n, and m is the total number of coeffi-
        cients. Therefore, the more points in the sample, the more information for the statistical test.
        2.4.3.4. The inputs should adequately portray the behavior of the data at various levels of work-
        load.

2.5. Correlation Analysis.
     2.5.1. Correlation Statistics. The statistics (R², Syx, and V) are needed to evaluate how well an equa-
     tion represents the observed data (Y). These measures are derived from the variation within the mea-
     sured man-hours. The sums of squares and the types of variation used to form these overall statistics
     are presented here and summarized in Figure 2.3..

       2.5.2. Total Sum of Squares (TSS). When it is necessary to predict man-hours (Y), the best predictor
       is Y-bar, the mean of measured man-hours. Hence, the total variation within the system is associated
       with the total sum of the squared deviations (TSS) of the Y-values about its mean.
80                                                            AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003



     2.5.3. Standard Deviation of Y (sy). The standard deviation of the measured man-hours (Y) is esti-
     mated by the square root of TSS divided by the degrees of freedom (n-1).




This expression can be put in a form that is easier to compute:




     2.5.4. Sum of Squares Explained by Regression (SSR). When the information in the X-values is used
     to form a prediction equation (Yc = a + bX), the best estimate of a new Y-value is Yc instead of Y-bar.
     The amount of reduction is defined as the SSR. The degrees of freedom for SSR are (m-1).




     2.5.5. Sum of Squares Unexplained by Regression (SSE). The remaining variation in Y is defined as
     the SSE.




     2.5.6. Standard Error of the Estimate (Syx). When SSE is divided by the degrees of freedom (n-m), the
     variation that remains in the regression system is estimated. The square root of this is defined as the
     standard error of the estimate. This is used to calculate the coefficient of variation.




     2.5.7. Coefficient of Variation (V). The standard error of the estimate gives a measure of how the
     observed data is scattered about the regression line. To compare this information between different
     equations, a relative measure is needed. Hence, the coefficient of variation is defined as the standard
     error of the estimate divided by the average man-hours. This indicates how large the standard devia-
     tion is with relation to the mean.
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                               81


   This yields a measure that has no dimension and can be used to set up criteria for the levels of accept-
   able variability in an equation.
   2.5.8. Coefficient of Determination (R²). When the coefficients in the equation are estimated with the
   "least squares" method, an additional relationship exists between these sum of squares. By dividing
   both sides of the equation by the total sum of the squares (TSS), two proportions result that sum to
   one.


                                                       , or




R² is defined as the proportion of the total variation that is explained by the regression line. R2 values
range from zero to one.


R² = EXPLAINED/TOTAL = SSR/TSS


When the regression explains most of the variation, R² approaches the value of one. When there is a large
amount of unexplained variation, R² approach zero. The square root of the coefficient of determination
(R) is defined as the coefficient of correlation. Correlation ranges from a minus one to a plus one.



2.6. Significance Tests.
   2.6.1. The F-test.
       2.6.1.1. To be useful in prediction, an equation must explain or account for more of the variability
       in the man-hours than is left unexplained. The F-test is used for this determination. To do the
       F-test, two values are needed; the test statistic (F) and the critical value (F*).
       2.6.1.2. The test statistic (F) is the ratio of the variance explained by regression to the unexplained
       variance. Variances are obtained by dividing sum of squares with their respective degrees of free-
       dom.


 F = SSR/(m-1)
      SSE/(n-m)
82                                                              AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


F, expressed as a function of R2 is:




        2.6.1.3. The critical value for the F-test, [F* = F(1-a, m-1, n-m)], comes from the f-Table at
        Attachment 2. The degrees of freedom for the numerator (m-1) are arrayed across the top of the
        Table and the degrees of freedom for the denominator (n-m) are listed down the left side.
        2.6.1.4. If the test statistic is larger or equal to the critical value (F> F*), the equation explains a
        significant amount of variation of man-hours.
     2.6.2. The t-test.
        2.6.2.1. The t-test determines if the individual coefficients of an equation are significantly differ-
        ent from zero. A value whose coefficient is not significantly different from zero contributes noth-
        ing to the prediction equation and should not be retained. As with the F-test, a test statistic and a
        critical value are needed to do this test.
        2.6.2.2. The test statistic for multivariate coefficients (tb) is usually calculated by automated sta-
        tistical routines; however, in the case of only two independent variables (X1 and X2 ), it may be
        calculated manually. In other multivariate situations (more than two independent variables), use of
        a reliable automated statistical package to calculate and print out these t-values (confidence levels)
        will be acceptable.
        2.6.2.3. The critical value, [t* = t(1-a/2, n-1)], comes from the t-Table at Attachment 2. The con-
        fidence level (1-a) is set at 80%, ( = 0.20). This is based on the decision that to drop a variable out
        of the equation when it may be valuable is more damaging than to leave a variable in the equation
        when it may be of little value. Because the t-test is two tailed (concerned with values positively
        and negatively different from zero (see Figure 2.4.)), the alpha-level is split and the critical value
        becomes [t*=t(.90, n-1)].
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                               83


Figure 2.4. Decision Rule for the t-test.




       2.6.2.4. If the test statistic (t) calculated from the data (considering its absolute value) is greater
       than or equal to the critical value (Table value), the coefficient in question is significantly different
       from zero and should be used in the equation.

2.7. Evaluation of the Results and Model Selection.
   2.7.1. The most common use of regression analysis in the MEP is to develop equations that express
   the required man-hours for a work center in terms of one or more workload factors (WLFs). For one
   work center, several equations may be developed. The selection of one of these equations to be the
   manpower model for that work center needs a balance between several different factors. The major
   considerations are highlighted here.
   2.7.2. Make sure the selected equation is built with logical workload factors.
   2.7.3. Select one equation from a group of equations based on both the overall statistics of the equa-
   tions and the simplicity of the equation form itself.
       2.7.3.1. The equation with the best overall statistics (largest R² and smallest V) is the equation that
       most closely fits the data. Such an equation is favored in the selection process.
       2.7.3.2. When the overall statistics for equations are close in value, select the simplest equation.
   2.7.4. Before selecting a regression model, it must pass the F-test (that is, it must explain a significant
   portion of the variability).
   2.7.5. The coefficients for the parabola and multivariate equations should pass the t-test (be signifi-
   cantly different from zero) to be kept in the equation. However, there may be situations that favor
   keeping a variable in the equation that does not pass the t-test. The worst consequence of such a deci-
   sion is the retention of a variable that contributes very little statistically to the equation, yet manpower
   is expended to collect WLF data.
84                                                           AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


     2.7.6. An equation must also meet both the realistic and the economic criteria to be acceptable as a
     manpower model. An equation is realistic when it has a positive slope, with no net loss of man-hours
     for an increase in workload within the extrapolation range of the model. Negative Y-intercepts in the
     model are allowed. However, exclude negative values of Y from the extrapolation range.
     2.7.7. An equation is economical if, at any point in the model, a unit increase in workload causes an
     increase in manpower when compared to all previous per unit changes in manpower.
     2.7.8. Man-hour equation coefficients meet both the realistic and economic criteria when:
        2.7.8.1. The linear model (Y = a + bX) b-coefficient is positive. Increases in workload result in a
        constant positive increase in manpower.
        2.7.8.2. The parabolic model (Y = a + bX + cX²) b-coefficient is positive, and the c-coefficient is
        negative, and workload values do not exceed the point where X = -b/2c (apex). If the b and c con-
        ditions are met and workload is greater than -b/2c, increasing workload after the apex results in
        decreasing manpower and the model is not realistic.
        2.7.8.3. The power model (Y = aXb) a-coefficient is positive and b-coefficient is between zero and
        one. This restricts the model to an increasing function where Y increases more slowly as X
        increases.
        2.7.8.4. The ratio model [Y = X/(a + bX)] a-coefficient and b-coefficient are greater than zero.
     2.7.9. Figure 2.5. , Realistic and Economic Criteria, summarizes the preceding discussion.

2.8. Using Scattergrams. The most useful tool to analyze C&R computations is the scattergram. The
scattergram is merely an X-Y graph of the plotted input points. Develop a scattergram before or in con-
junction with regression computations. Use this chart to graphically identify outliers that influence other
input points. Figure 2.6. gives example data and associated scattergram for the calculations in the next

2.9. General Calculations. Use of an automated statistical package (see note below) for computing
regression equations will be acceptable. Manual computation procedures may also be used and are shown
to illustrate the process and to aid interpretation of the results. Table 2.1. illustrates the computation pro-
cess for regression coefficients with one dependent variable. Table 2.2. illustrates the computation pro-
cess for the multivariate model with two independent variables and the parabolic model with one
independent variable. These two models are combined in Table 2.2. because of their similarity of compu-
tations. When doing manual computations, carry as many decimal places as possible and round only for
the final answer. When using one answer in further computations, for example, using "b" to compute "a,"
use the unrounded value.
NOTE: AFMIA does not advocate any particular automated statistical application. Reliable results
can be produced with most MS Windows-based packages. Text and graphics should be exportable to
your word processor.

     2.10.2. Both the linear and parabolic equations explain a significant portion of the variance because
     each equation passes the F-test.
     2.10.3. The squared term in the parabolic equation has a coefficient that is significantly different from
     zero. It passes the t-test.
     2.10.4. The equations are also evaluated by the realistic and economic criteria.
        2.10.4.1. The linear equation passes both of these tests because it has a slope that is positive and
        constant.
        2.10.4.2. The parabolic equation passes the first part of the realistic test because the "b" is greater
        than zero and "c" is negative. However, it fails the second part because the apex is within the data
        range.
            2.10.4.2.1. The highest X-value for the input data points is 7.5.



            2.10.4.2.2. Apex =



            2.10.4.2.3. Since 6.348 is less than 7.5, the parabolic equation should not be used. A special
            equation form such as the ratio or power curve may fit better in this case.

2.11. Calculations for the Special Equation Forms.
     2.11.1. Power Curve. When the general equation Y = aXb is transformed using logarithms, it becomes
     log Y = log a + b(log X). These transformed values can then be used in the general formulas for linear
     regression to find a and b. This procedure only gives an approximation of the true a and b values.
     Using these transformed values in the general equation for R² can yield negative values for R², that are
     theoretically impossible since R² must range between zero and one. A better estimate of these coeffi-
     cients (a and b) is obtained by computing these coefficients through an iterative process using Taylor's
     series approximations. Once these new coefficients have been found, they can be used in the general
     formula for R². This procedure gives an unbiased estimate of a and b and reduces the occurrence of
     negative R² values. Further discussion of the iteration process for transformed linear models can be
     found in Neter, Applied Linear and Statistical Models.
     2.11.2. Ratio Curve. When the general equation Y = X/(a + bX) is transformed, it becomes X/Y = a +
     bX. The transformed values (X/Y ratios) can be used in the general formula for linear regression in
     lieu of Y-values as was done with the power curve.

2.12. Calculations for Multivariate Models. Calculations for multivariate models having more than
two independent variables are generally done with computers and are beyond the scope of this publica-
tion.

2.13. Rounding Procedures.
     2.13.1. As a general rule, do all computations using the capability of your computing device. For
     example, if that device is a calculator with seven-decimal capability, then use seven decimals. Round
     only the final result to the number of decimal places shown in Table 2.3..

   2.13.2. Once the number of decimal places is decided, discard all of the digits to the right of that
   point. Do not change any digits to the left of that point. Round the last digit to be kept up only if the
   digit to the right of it is greater than or equal to 5. Examples of rounding numbers to three decimal
   places are:
       2.13.2.1. 27.16346...becomes 27.163 because 4 is less than 5.
       2.13.2.2. 31.39461...becomes 31.395 because 6 is greater than 5.
       2.13.2.3. 16.48450...becomes 16.485 because 5 is equal to 5.

Section 2B—Analysis and Adjustments

2.14. General Concepts. Variations in data can be expected even in the most carefully designed study.
However, some variation may be due to levels of service or poor measurement. Regardless of the reasons,
the data must be analyzed to make sure required work is done at an acceptable level. This section
describes procedures for doing data analysis and adjustments.

2.15. Data Correction and Data Adjustment Differences. Although data corrections and data adjust-
ments are similar, there is a distinct difference.
   2.15.1. Data Corrections. Make mathematical corrections before doing C&R. Corrections consist of
   administrative errors such as incorrectly transcribing the data, using improper frequencies, or not fol-
   lowing measurement instructions in the measurement plan. Corrections also consist of computational
   errors. Most corrections have relatively minor impact on measured man-hours and do not need coor-
   dination with the functional OPR. Audit trails of all corrections, including computational errors and
   rounding differences, are kept in the study team's backup files but are not documented in the final
   report.

     2.15.2. Data Adjustments. Make data adjustments only after investigation has identified the reason
     for extreme data and the need for adjustment. The lead study craftsman makes adjustments to normal-
     ize the level of service only when the senior functional manager concurs with the adjustment. Docu-
     ment adjustments in the final report and keep an audit trail for adjustments in the final report backup
     data file. Do not make adjustments solely to improve statistics.

2.16. Study Team Responsibilities.
     2.16.1. Do a 100% math check of all input computations. For computerized products, make sure that
     numerical data have been transferred into your statistical package correctly.
     2.16.2. Check each input for consistency.
     2.16.3. Investigate the representativeness of reported work counts.
     2.16.4. Check work center comments.
     2.16.5. Keep a record of all significant information and rationale used to analyze the input data.
     2.16.6. Document all mathematical corrections on the forms.
     2.16.7. Make sure that adjustments are based on sound logic and expert opinions.

2.17. Statistical Analysis. (See Statistical Tables at Attachment 2 for R2 and V criteria.)
     2.17.1. Use your statistical package (see Note below) and this section to begin data analysis.
     2.17.2. Set up your initial C&R data using man-hours for the Y-variable. For the X-variable, use only
     logical and acceptable potential WLF values. For example, "hospital beds" may be logical, but if all
     input locations don't have hospital beds, then the WLF is not acceptable.
     2.17.3. Run initial multivariate C&R and detail based on one standard error. Many inferences can be
     made from this first run. For example, does the work center display standardization? Is the data statis-
     tically acceptable with minor adjustments? Which bases are exerting the most influence on the data?
     Follow this chronological sequence.
        2.17.3.1. Assume the first C&R run with five potential WLFs yields the statistics and detail
        shown in Figure 2.8..
NOTE: The more substantive statistical packages produce the Table of R Values and Order of Entry
Statistics. The new MSDS C&R module incorporates these statistics and will operate in Windows as an
Excel add-on.

      2.17.3.2. The objective of initial analysis is to find an acceptable equation using minimum vari-
      ables. Does an acceptable equation exist with one or a combination of the five independent vari-
      ables in Figure 2.8.? The answer is, "probably yes." Inspection of the Table of r-values shows that
      only one WLF (X) passes the criteria for a bivariate relationship. This criteria is .7071 or      .

     2.17.3.3. Run a bivariate C&R analysis using the WLF that had the highest r-value greater than
     .7071. If no r-values are higher than .7071, do not waste time running bivariate analysis - the
     improvement between bivariate models is insignificant at this point. In Figure 2.8., the WLF for
     X5 against Y has an r-value of .7135; however, the bivariate relationship for this WLF does not
     yield a desired v-value.
     2.17.3.4. Pay particular attention to the order of entry (see Figure 2.8.). The multivariate program
     is based on stepwise regression analysis. This means that the first X entered into the equation (X5)
     is the one with the highest R. The second X entered into the equation (X3) is the one that, in com-
     bination with the one already entered, improves the equation the most, and so on. The next run to
     try would be multivariate with Y versus X5 and X3 (see Figure 2.9.). Although this run is signif-
     icantly better than the bivariate run (not shown), the v-value is still greater than the desired maxi-
     mum .250.

        2.17.3.6. Next, run multivariate C&R using Y, X5, X3, and X2. In this case, all three b-values
        pass the significance test, and the v is further improved. However, v is still larger than .250 (see
        Figure 2.10.).
        2.17.3.7. Continue running multivariate C&R as above until an acceptable equation is reached or
        there are no more Xs. For this data set, the best combination is Y against X5, X3, X2, X1 (see Fig-
        ure 2.11.).

             2.17.3.8.1. With only minor adjustments, satisfactory statistics can be achieved.

             2.17.3.8.2. The most suspect point for questioning of input data is base number 4, that is out-
             side one Syx by 23.312 man-hours.
         2.17.3.9. The next step is to do C&R at the next lower level; that is, use direct rather than total
         man-hours against workload. The purpose of this analysis is to identify outliers only.
         2.17.3.10. After this step, continue with ratio analysis. First, use the ratio of direct-to-indirect time
         at each location. This analysis may be done with the work unit time standard routine or a
         hand-held calculator. Second, use ratio analysis for process times and work units.
      2.17.4. At this stage in data analysis, you should know what data needs questioning and investigating
      and the process that needs further analysis.
         2.17.4.1. When process level analysis shows problems with the data, do a more detailed step anal-
         ysis. Step analysis of operational audit data can help with identifying extreme values that affect
         process results. Even if initial C&R is acceptable, you should still do analysis at the process level
         for OA studies. Do this to verify that there is no erroneous data hidden by the wash effect of over-
         all C&R.
         2.17.4.2. Consider data outside two standard errors (two standard deviations if using work unit
         times) as candidates for investigation and possible adjustment. This assumes all administrative
         and logic data corrections have already been made to the data base.
         2.17.4.3. Making proper data adjustments can be quite difficult and controversial. Therefore, you
         need a high degree of coordination and documentation. Although statistical procedures are used to
         identify adjustment candidates, failing statistical accuracy is not an acceptable reason for adjusting
         data. When there is a logical cause for the dispersion, the data point will be considered either rep-
         resentative or not representative. If representative, include the data point in the final equation
         development. If not representative, consider it for variance development. Normalize extremes
         when they are abnormal and illogical, but do not adjust the data when extreme values occur for a
         valid reason. Do logic analysis as follows:
             2.17.4.3.1. Compare per accomplishment times (PATs) and activity frequencies (FREQs) to
             benchmark times or frequency reports.
             2.17.4.3.2. Question the reasons for the high or low PATs and FREQs (for example, low
             skilled personnel or recent transfers).
             2.17.4.3.3. Check for any patterns in the data (for example, high data for an entire input base).
             2.17.4.3.4. Evaluate the effect of the Statement of Conditions (SOC) on the PATs and FREQs.
             2.17.4.3.5. Solicit the input craftsman's opinion of the data and particular problems encoun-
             tered during measurement. Request clarification or re-measurement, if needed.
             2.17.4.3.6. Solicit the functional OPR’s opinion of the measured data. Request help in clarify-
             ing controversial issues. For example: Identifying a step being done in a variety of ways in the
             field, thereby causing extreme values in the collected data, is a difficult problem. Staff this
             problem with the functional OPR to make sure the correct level of service is included in the
             standard.
             2.17.4.3.7. Coordinate all adjustments.
             2.17.4.3.8. Record all data adjustments in Part Three of the final report.

       2.17.4.4. Adjust data as follows:
           2.17.4.4.1. Develop an acceptable data range for PATs or work unit times based on study team
           evaluation of measurement data. Once developed, this data range should be explained and
           coordinated with the OPR. Adjust unexplainable data points above this range to the upper limit
           of the range and adjust unexplainable data points below the range to the lower limit of the
           range.
           2.17.4.4.2. As a benchmark, make sure the sum of all data adjustments (excluding administra-
           tive corrections) does not exceed five percent of the measured man-hours for the study total. If
           adjustments exceed the five percent threshold, informally coordinate recommended data
           adjustments.
           2.17.4.4.3. The study team saves the data used to develop the final equation. This data can be
           saved on computer disks or a copy of the measurement report can be placed in the data files.

2.18. Initiative or Option Measurement Data. All initiatives or options not included in the study
should be documented and included as an attachment to the final report. Pay careful attention to make sure
that each item is documented so that it may be incorporated into the standard at a later date. Make sure
that enough data is available to change the standard once senior management approves the inclusion of the
initiative or option.

Section 2C—Extrapolation Limits

2.19. General Concepts. Extrapolation is defined as extending the regression line beyond the range of
the input data. Any extrapolation involves an element of statistical risk. However, to increase standards'
utility, expand standards' applicability, and prevent rapid obsolescence due to workload changes, the MEP
uses 25% above and below the largest and smallest Yc value. These limits represent the maximum amount
an equation can be extended. They do not preclude the use of more limited extrapolation when the total
amount would be unrealistic.

2.20. Factors Affecting Extrapolation.
   2.20.1. Several factors increase confidence in the extrapolation limits built into the standard. These
   factors are low standard error, high number of input locations, even distribution of WLF volumes, and
   absence of extreme values.
   2.20.2. An equation that represents a sharp curve near the low or high end of the input data range or
   an equation that has rapidly leveling slopes may not allow the full 25% extrapolation.
   2.20.3. Statistical procedures, however complex and exacting, are not a substitute for analysis of data
   points falling in the extended range of applicability. Regardless of the method used in computing this
   range, logical considerations must also be looked at when the standard is extended.

2.21. Computation of Extrapolation Limits. Use the steps in Table 2.4., Table 2.5., and Table 2.6. to
compute the selected equations extrapolation limits. See Figure 2.12., Figure 2.13., and Figure 2.14. for
the data base and graph for these models. Carry four or more decimal places during computations, then
round the final answer to two decimal places. Insert the statistical printout in the final report to show
extrapolation limits.

     make one of the following decisions:                                                        Y-Apex
     (1) If the Y-Apex is less than the max Yc, then the                         1455.87
     parabola is not acceptable.
                                                                                Yu 1164.6975
     (2) If the Y-Apex is greater than Yu, then Yu
     remains the upper extrapolation limit. (3) If the Max Yc
     Y-Apex is between Yc and Yy, then the apex
     becomes the upper extrapolation limit. However,
     since the extrapolation range is limited, the next
     best acceptable equation should be selected.       In this example, the Y-Apex is greater than Yu, therefore
                                                        Yu remains the upper extrapolation limit.

2.22. Special Consideration in Extrapolation.
      2.22.1. Lower Extrapolation Limit. For bivariate linear equations, parabolic equations, and multivari-
      ate equations with positive coefficients, the lower extrapolation limit must be greater than or equal to
      the a-value in the equation.
      2.22.2. Multivariate Equations. The extrapolation limits for multivariate equations are based on pre-
      dicted man-hours only (Yu and Yl from steps 2 and 3 of Table 2.4.).
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                         111


   2.22.3. Single Location Standards. Extrapolation for a single location standard is based on ±25% of
   the calculated man-hours. Hence, the limits are Yl = .75Yc and Yu = 1.25Yc. Note that in single loca-
   tion standards, the measures Y, Yc, and Y-bar should be approximately equal.
   2.22.4. Modular Equations. To find the extrapolation limits for modular equations, compute the limits
   for each module as outlined in paragraph 2.21. and Table 2.4., Table 2.5., orTable 2.6..
   2.22.5. Power Model. Follow the procedures for a linear equation. No special considerations are
   needed.
   2.22.6. Special Calculation Procedures for Computing Workload Data Range. The two models that
   need an upper workload value to be stated are:
       2.22.6.1. Parabolic model. Because the equation for this model starts to decrease after the apex
       value, there will be some large workload values that yield man-hours within the acceptable extrap-
       olation range that are unusable. To illustrate, refer to the parabolic equation in 2.14.. A workload
       factor value of 350, when substituted in the parabolic equation yields 1271.11 man-hours -
       1271.11 man-hours is in the acceptable extrapolation range, but it is on the decreasing segment of
       the curve. The formula for computing the upper workload data range for a parabolic model is in
       Table 2.6..
       2.22.6.2. Hyperbolic (ratio) model. Because the equation for this model approaches, but never
       crosses, an asymptote, workload can increase endlessly (after a certain point) and never yield any
       additional man-hours. The formula for computing the upper workload data range for a hyperbolic
       model is in Table 2.5..

2.23. Use of Extrapolation Limits. After the extrapolation limits are computed, report them as the
"Standard Applicability Man-Hour Range" on AF Form 1113, Standard Manpower Table. For those
standards with more than one man-hour equation, record the standard applicability man-hour range for
each equation in Application Instructions of the AFMS. Always state this range in man-hours.

Section 2D—Skill and Grade Determination

2.24. General Concepts. The process of skill and grade determination converts total manpower standard
requirements into units of manpower with the skills and grades necessary to do the defined work center
mission. Skill and grade determination must not be affected by external constraints or funding limitations.
The minimum essential work center requirements must be engineered and documented independently of
resource availability. Other methods may be used, but the specific procedure and data source must be doc-
umented in the manpower standard final report.

2.25. Skill and Grade Determination without C&R.
   2.25.1. Step 1. Derive Total Man-Hours for Each Location. Total man-hours are derived by summing
   the direct and indirect man-hours.
   2.25.2. Step 2. Compute Recommended Manpower Requirements for Each Location. Divide the
   man-hours in step 1 by the correct man-hour availability factor (MAF) and overload factor (military
   MAF, if work center is mixed). For example, 663.60 / (151.5 x 1.077) = 4.067. Round the resulting
   fractional manpower requirement to the correct whole manpower requirement IAW AFI 38-201.

      2.25.3. Step 3. Estimate Required Grades and Skills for Each Location. The input craftsman consults
      with the work center supervisor and local OPR to get a proposed distribution. Record the recom-
      mended distribution as directed by the study team. For example,


             AFSC(1)           AFSC(2)       AFSC(3)


         9   7   5   3       9 7 5 3           CG


         1MSG 1SSG           1TSG 1SSG         1CPT


      2.25.4. Step 4. Determine Grades and Skills for AF Form 1113. The study team checks input recom-
      mendations and rationale, averages the input team recommendations for each level on the manpower
      table, and completes the table. The study team reconciles any grade inversion on the manpower table.
      For example, the number for a particular grade and skill should not decrease when compared to the
      previous column on the manpower table.
      2.25.5. Step 5. Coordinate Proposed Grade and Skill Distribution. The study team coordinates the
      manpower table with the OPR as part of the final report.

2.26. Skill and Grade Determination with C&R.
      2.26.1. Study Planning. During this phase of standards development, the study team and the func-
      tional OPR predetermine the Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) based on steps shown in the process
      oriented description (POD). Skill distribution is also decided and shown as a percentage of each step.
      Study teams:
         2.26.1.1. Investigate manpower currently used in the work center including current authorized
         and assigned military and DoD civilian strengths along with their respective grades and skills by
         MAJCOM, by base. The Manpower Data System (MDS) is a source for military and civilian
         authorizations while local base products will give assigned strength data.
         2.26.1.2. Check corresponding Air Force Specialty (AFS) descriptions in AFMANs 36-2105,
         Officer Classification, and 36-2108, Airman Classification, and specialty training standards
         (STSs).
         2.26.1.3. Identify steps that, by directive, need to be done by a specific AFS, skill level, or grade.
         2.26.1.4. Analyze the POD and, based on research and interviews with the functional OPR, iden-
         tify the AFSC needed to do the step.
             2.26.1.4.1. The concept that workers spend most of their work time performing at their high-
             est skill level governs what skills are needed. Identifying and distributing skills catalogs the
             total manpower requirement into the proper types and qualifications of workers.
             2.26.1.4.2. Give particular attention to picking the proper category of manpower require-
             ments. Make sure that rated specialties are needed only when the duties involved clearly jus-
             tify such action. It is Air Force policy to use senior noncommissioned officers in lieu of lower
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                           113


             grade commissioned officers when practical and feasible. Officer requirements must be justi-
             fied by responsibilities or duties specifically needing an officer.
          2.26.1.5. Document the skill percentage requirement in matrix format for each step as displayed
          in Figure 2.15.. Note that some steps can be done entirely by a given AFSC while the varying
          complexity of others may need more experience. Show officer requirements in the company grade
          or field grade category. Show colonel (0-6) requirements separately.

     any necessary changes as recommended fractional manpower requirements. The total computed
     requirement must equal the total recommended requirement with minor variations because of
     rounding. Any change from computed to recommended for a given AFS that is more than .5 of a
     whole person requirement must be documented to show rationale for the change.
     2.26.2.5. Submit grade recommendations to the study team for consideration only on an exception
     basis. Submit narrative recommendations to supplement the quantitative skill level input.
     2.26.2.6. Send the completed Computed and Recommended Manpower by AFSC to the study
     team. A sample format is shown at Figure 2.17..
  2.26.3. Data Analysis and Computation. During this activity of standards development, the study
  team analyzes recommended AFSCs sent by the input teams and, along with the OPR, decides the
  grade requirements. Use these analysis procedures.
     2.26.3.1. Record the recommended fractional manpower for each base on a separate chart for each
     AFS. For example, the recommended fractional manpower for AFS BBBXX from Base A (Figure
     2.16.) is recorded as the first line of Figure 2.17. The first column of Figure 2.18. is the total man-
     power recommended for that AFS (sum of the skill levels).

 NOTE: Do not combine equations. Separate equations retain the skill level identity.




         2.26.3.2. Plot a scattergram for each AFSC, for example, 3S090, 3SO71, 3S051, 3SO31. Put the
         total measured fractional manpower on the horizontal (X) axis and recommended fractional man-
         power for the skill level being analyzed on the vertical (Y) axis. Figure 2.19. shows a scattergram
         of the 7-skill level recommendations for AFS BBBXX. A scattergram aids in spotting any obvious

      inconsistencies in recommended skills. If there are inconsistencies, they may be explained in the
      input team's comments. If not, talk to the input team to determine the rationale for their recom-
      mendations. Adjust specialty and skill distribution percentage data, as needed. Document the rea-
      son for adjustment.

Figure 2.19. Fractional Manpower & Skill Level Scattergram.




      2.26.3.3. Fit a regression line to the data for each AFSC (see Figure 2.18.). This aids both in sta-
      tistically identifying the best skill level model and in picking the phase points for increasing the
      manpower for each AFSC.
      2.26.3.4. Study the data array and the scattergram to find the man-hour values when there are sig-
      nificant changes (any amount of additional manpower) in either specialty or skill requirements.
      The incremental changes can be found by working each equation for the desired manpower value.
      Some examples of these are: the point that an officer requirement first takes place; the point that a
      staff-officer AFSC is first needed; similar points for 3, 5, 7, or 9-skill level requirements; and the
      point that multiple requirements for any of the foregoing first occur.

2.27. Procedures for Grade Requirements.
   2.27.1. The study team, jointly with the OPR, analyzes the resulting manpower skill level distribution
   to set grade requirements. These considerations are addressed by the study team before setting grade
   requirements.
      2.27.1.1. Read AFI 36-2618, Enlisted Force Structure, and AFI 36-2611, Officer Professional
      Development Guide, to get an understanding of the particular AFSs and their relationships within
      the functional area under study. Also read AFD 36-14, Position Management and Classification,
      for treatment of civilian positions.
      2.27.1.2. Check the need to keep career field experience. The effect of promotion opportunities
      within each skill level should be checked to reduce the experience loss caused by retraining from
      one career field to another. In an ideal situation, these grade percentages exists for each skill level.
118                                                            AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


          9-level: 33% CMSgt and 67% SMSgt
          7-level: 40% MSgt and 60% TSgt
          5-level: 50% SSgt and 50% SrA
         Also, look at the latest profile for the entire career progression group. Base a decision to signifi-
         cantly deviate from the profile on specific needs of the work center as projected to the total popu-
         lation of the Air Force specialty.
NOTE: Both CMSgt and SMSgt grades are identified with the 9-skill level for purposes of grade distri-
bution percentage. However, the CMSgt grade is reported with a chief enlisted manager (CEM) AFSC
XXX00.
         2.27.1.3. Analyze the current usage of personnel within the career field, and purge it of any math-
         ematical errors. This is a separate and distinct process from analysis and adjustment covered in
         Section 2B. The end result of C&R is only as good as the data it's based on.
      2.27.2. Identify the steps within an AFSC in a relative order as to experience and ability needed, in
      terms of grades.
      2.27.3. Find those points in each step list where the transition is made from one grade to another.
      Assume the lowest grade specified for each AFSC is needed to do the lowest ranking step identified
      on that AFSC's step list.
      2.27.4. Using the lowest ranking step for each AFSC as a point of departure, estimate the amount of
      time needed in the functional area to get the necessary experience to satisfactorily do the succeeding
      higher-ranking steps. Base these estimates on the anticipated experience of an average individual pro-
      gressing through a typical technical education, on-the-job training, and career progression pattern.
      2.27.5. Check each list with the measurement data to find the man-hours spent at the different levels
      of step difficulty.
      2.27.6. Check the working relationship between the work center and other agencies. The scope and
      sensitivity of these interfaces may need some degree of grade comparability between working coun-
      terparts. Evaluate input team grade comments that may influence the grade requirement.

2.28. AFSC and Grade Documentation.
      2.28.1. Compute and document the AFSC and grade distributions needed for varying manpower
      totals on an AF Form 1113.
      2.28.2. Use each AFS equation resulting from regression analysis to compute the total personnel
      needed for each skill level.
         2.28.2.1. The independent variable in each equation (X value) is the incremental manpower
         requirement (4, 5,...9, etc.).
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                   119


     2.28.2.2. Thus, to compute the manpower distribution for a total of nine spaces, using the skill
     level equations in Figure 2.18..


       Y9 = -1.244 + 0.4297(9) - 0.01(9)²


       Y9 = 1.813 or 2 9-levels


       Y7 = 0.2709 + 0.1873(9)


       Y7 = 1.957 or 2 7-levels


       Y5 = 0.4074 + 0.3251(9)


       Y5 = 3.333 or 3 5-levels


       Y3 = -0.1639 + 0.2838(9)


       Y3 = 2.390 or 2 3-levels


  2.28.3. Due to rounding, strict use of the fractional manpower breakpoints may yield more or less
  than the total work center requirement (X-value). Together, the study team and functional OPR find
  the correct rounding point that maintains the total requirement.

                                            CORE MODELING

3.1. General Concepts.
      3.1.1. Core modeling is a study technique designed to capture common core workload and related
      manpower requirements for a particular function. The process still allows for differences (variances)
      caused by mission, technological, or environmental factors. In the past, it was difficult to obtain our
      customer's or functional OPR's concurrence because of the uncertainty of whether or not credit was
      given for all work (including unique or peculiar situations) done by the function. Core modeling may
      be used with almost any measurement method, except work sampling. It is particularly suited to work-
      shop measurement when using flow procedures charting, operational audit, and staffing pattern meth-
      ods to determine requirements. For our purposes, core workload is the most important part of a work
      center's or function's workload that must be completed to accomplish the mission.
      3.1.2. A depiction of core modeling would be:
         3.1.2.1. Functional core man-hours with variance man-hours for individual differences. The total
         man-hours are then used to determine total work center man-hours.
         3.1.2.2. Then, total work center man-hours are divided by the man-hour availability factor (MAF)
         to find the total work center requirements.

3.2. Specific Procedures. The procedures for developing a core modeling manpower standard are basi-
cally the same steps as any other standard, but the sequence of the operations are different. The steps are
as follows:
      3.2.1. Develop the core POD identifying only minimum requirements necessary to perform the work
      center's mission. This should be a coordinated effort between the functional and manpower communi-
      ties, and all customers should give full participation.
      3.2.2. Verify the POD and obtain approval of the core POD with all customers. Also request that they
      start identifying their differences (variances) and unique situations that are not included in the core
      POD, but essential to mission completion. Keep in mind, that variances are only for environmental,
      technological, or mission differences, not for nice-to-have programs, indirect work, additional duties,
      etc.
      3.2.3. The study team develops and measures the core model. Use whatever measurement method is
      most conducive for the function.
      3.2.4. The study team prepares a final report with only the core model equations identified, and
      requests that the customers identify and quantify their variance requirements. The manpower commu-
      nity normally quantifies the variances, as well as prices out the core model. Core man-hours and vari-
      ance man-hours are used to find total work center requirements. The total package, including
      comments is sent to the study team.
      3.2.5. The study team and the Senior Functional Manager review and analyze each variance to deter-
      mine its validity. See AFMAN 38-208, Volume 1, paragraph 3.27 for processing variances.
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                            121


   3.2.6. The study team determines the overall impact of the manpower standard, provides feedback to
   all customers relative to their variance disposition, revises the final report if necessary, and briefs the
   total estimated impact.
   3.2.7. The MAJCOM Manpower and Organization Directorate submits the core model and variances
   to AFMIA to be published as the manpower standard.

3.3. Benefits of Core Modeling.
   3.3.1. One benefit of using the core modeling technique is that our functional OPRs or customers
   view this type of technique as "fair and equitable" because their unique workloads have been
   addressed as part of the formal study process.
   3.3.2. Another benefit of using this technique is that the study isn't "bogged down" during data anal-
   ysis, trying to address outlying data points and individual base concerns. This normally reduces the
   overall study time.
   3.3.3. Core Modeling gives our functional managers or customers a tool to decide what level of ser-
   vice they can afford.
   3.3.4. This study technique is particularly useful in nonstandardized functions where mode of opera-
   tions differ, in functions with undefined levels of service, or in work centers where previous tries to
   develop manpower standards proved unsuccessful. Examples would be Budget, Cost Analysis, and
   Operational Contracting.

3.4. Disadvantages of Core Modeling. The major disadvantage of core modeling is the additional
workload taskings on the manpower community to collect and quantify the variance workload in the
beginning. This can be alleviated if the manpower and functional communities are involved in the study
process from the beginning, are briefed on what has been captured as core workload, and are briefed on
what needs to be identified as variance workload. This allows them to get a head start on the process, and
eliminates potential misunderstandings and confusion.

                                 FLOW PROCEDURES (FP) CHARTING

4.1. General Concepts.
      4.1.1. In the past, obtaining concurrence on measurement data was difficult due to functional OPR
      uncertainty that the level of detail of the measurement included all work being accomplished in the
      work center. FP charting displays a level of detail so specific that our customer or functional manager
      can determine what work is being performed, who's doing the work, how much time a process takes to
      perform, and where the delays in the process take place. This chapter provides an overview of the FP
      charting process and its use within the manpower or functional community.
      4.1.2. FP charting may be used in practically any work center, but is particularly suited to process-ori-
      ented work centers. A process is a series of actions that bring about an end or result. For our purposes,
      a process is a procedure with a definitive input and output product. Examples would be: TDY travel
      vouchers, supply requisitions, contract orders, etc.
      4.1.3. FP charting is especially helpful in areas where extremely long work cycles would preclude
      work sampling.
      4.1.4. If the study team is unable to get acceptable statistics from the measurement data, FP charting
      provides an alternate course of action. Since the data is already aligned procedurally, "b" coefficients
      are easily developed.

4.2. Benefits of FP Charting.
      4.2.1. The FP charting method is a good starting point for a most effective organization study. It pro-
      vides a tool allowing both the functional customer and manpower community to depict and analyze a
      work center under the current mode of operation, identify problems and improve the current opera-
      tion, and adopt an MEO. It also provides a performance measures tool that the function can use to
      monitor internal performance.
      4.2.2. FP charting segregates technical, administrative, and supervisory duties within the measure-
      ment data. This is particularly helpful in the development of the skills and grades matrix.
      4.2.3. Standard maintenance is greatly simplified. Because of the measurement detail provided in FP
      charts, changes to existing procedures are easily identified and quantified.
      4.2.4. FP charts can be used as forecasting tools to price out or determine the manpower impact of
      policy changes levied on a work center in advance.

4.3. Specific Characteristics. As with the OA method of measurement, FP charting uses activity time
values at the process, step, or even beyond to obtain measured man-hours. The primary difference
between OA measurement and FP charting is in the arraying of the measurement data. Some of the simi-
larities and differences are outlined as follows:
      4.3.1. Measurement Data. FP charting arrays data both vertically and horizontally. Each procedure
      identified has its own set of charts. A procedure may begin at whatever level of detail the study
      requires. Break each step down to the level the study team has determined will provide the best mea-
      surement data.
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                          123


   4.3.2. Per Accomplishment Time (PAT) Data. Obtain PAT data using the same procedures outlined in
   the chapter for operational audit (Chapter 9).
   4.3.3. Frequency data. Although frequency data may be obtained using the same methods as OA mea-
   surement, that is where the similarity ends. By aligning the work center steps procedurally, only a sin-
   gle frequency count (excluding conditional factors) needs to be collected for each procedure charted.
   4.3.4. Conditional Factors. Conditional factors relate to frequencies of a step and are those parts of a
   procedure that do not always occur with each repetition of a given work cycle or occur more than once
   per repetition. In order to account for these factors within a procedure's total time, the percentage of
   occurrence of that factor must be computed. The percentage of occurrence is obtained by dividing the
   number of times a given factor occurred within a procedure by the number of times it could have
   occurred. For example, if the work center frequency is service contracts processed for the service con-
   tract procedure, and if the second step in the procedure only occurs with 1 out of every 10 contracts, a
   percentage of occurrence would be determined as follows: 1 divided by 10 = 10%. This percentage or
   factor is then multiplied by the step time to obtain a constructed PAT. Thus, instead of giving full time
   for this step for only the cycles in which it would occur (something that might be difficult to measure),
   partial time is provided for the step in every cycle. This allows for a constructed time to be developed
   for even the most difficult or lengthy procedures. Also, as most conditional factors will be associated
   with rework, they clearly identify to functional management the areas on which to focus quality
   improvement efforts.
   4.3.5. Format. AF Form 3576, Flow/Procedures Chart, are designed based on the needs of each
   study. Charts will have a basic format for processes that are one page or chart and an extension format
   for processes that are over one page or chart. All processes should begin with the basic format chart.
   The following are specific chart characteristics:
       4.3.5.1. The page number of the chart should be identified in the top right hand corner.
       4.3.5.2. The upper left corner is general information about the procedure and should be completed
       by the study team or study manager.
       4.3.5.3. In the upper right corner are the chart symbols. See Figure 1.3. for symbol definitions.
       4.3.5.4. Next, determine how the positions or people involved in the procedure should be depicted
       on the chart.
       4.3.5.5. Use the extension sheet for a procedure over one page.

4.4. Precharting Activities.
   4.4.1. The guidelines for developing an FP chart are relatively simple as the technique provides max-
   imum flexibility in allowing the study team to express its measurement needs concisely to the input
   locations in the field.
   4.4.2. The first step in chart development is to become very familiar with the work center and to draft
   a step-by-step word description for those steps in the POD that are being considered for FP measure-
   ment. The study team must make sure that they fully understand the real procedures of the work cen-
   ter, as well as the respective input and output documents.
   4.4.3. The word description should depict the actions of work center personnel as they interact with
   the product or process being charted.
124                                                            AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


      4.4.4. As with other measurement methods, each step should have easily recognizable beginning and
      ending points for ease of measurement.
      4.4.5. Flow process chart items can be broken up into three types.
         4.4.5.1. Measurable Items. These are the steps in the procedure that will require measurement.
         Identify the type of method to be used in quantifying this step by using an alpha character below
         the step number. When choosing alpha characters to designate the measurement method, use the
         letter code shown in Table 9.1., Box 5H.
         4.4.5.2. Nonmeasurable Items. Nonmeasurable items are steps that do not expend work center
         man-hours but are charted in order to maintain process continuity. Some examples of nonmeasur-
         able items are origination and gap symbols. Another example would be when a measurable step is
         referenced elsewhere in another set of charts. This occurs when certain steps cross procedural
         boundaries. If this is the case and a separate work count for each procedure cannot be obtained,
         then develop another set of charts for each of the affected procedures. Since the man-hours for that
         step are accounted for elsewhere, this step becomes nonmeasurable in that procedure.
         4.4.5.3. Informational Items. The only items on an FP chart that do not have step numbers or sym-
         bols are informational items. These items are placed on the charts to clarify certain procedures or
         supply specific information designed to aid the input craftsman during measurement. Besides the
         normal step descriptions, informational items supply an additional avenue for the study team to
         describe occurrences in the process that may not otherwise be evident. This provides the input
         craftsman with a greater understanding of the procedure and what the measurement needs are.
      4.4.6. Once the word description has been finalized, the work must then be broken out by position.
      Although the manner in which work center positions are broken out depends on the study team, the
      most common type of breakout is by craftsman, administration, and supervisor. Dividing the workload
      along these lines allows the study team to determine the impact of administrative and supervisory per-
      sonnel on direct workload. Further breaking out the craftsman process by skill level provides for anal-
      ysis of craftsman grade structures as well.
      4.4.7. Once the position breakout has been done, procedures steps within those positions have been
      categorized, and process symbols have been assigned, the draft charts are then prepared.

4.5. FP Chart Preparation.
      4.5.1. The following steps are required to prepare a FP chart:
         4.5.1.1. Determine the procedure to be charted and its input and output documents.
         4.5.1.2. Determine how many people are involved in the process, the type of work they do, and
         interactions among personnel.
         4.5.1.3. Select the appropriate chart format in terms of the number of people needed in the pro-
         cess.
         4.5.1.4. Complete the top left portion of the chart and fill in column headings for required person-
         nel.
         4.5.1.5. Start the process with an origination symbol under the appropriate column where the doc-
         ument will be received.
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                          125


      4.5.1.6. Select a symbol to depict the next step or action taken in the procedure. Each symbol
      should be accompanied with a brief narrative statement.
      4.5.1.7. Continue to identify and depict each step with a symbol and narrative. For all measurable
      steps, the narrative statement should match the narrative on the POD. Only measurable steps will
      be identified on the POD; however, all measurable and nonmeasurable steps should have a step
      number.
      4.5.1.8. Make sure that all steps in the process are captured from start to finish.
      4.5.1.9. After all procedures in the work center have been captured, get together with the func-
      tional manager or other team members and review and analyze the current procedures. Your major
      objective is to determine where inefficiencies exist in the current mode of operation. The func-
      tional manager can be of tremendous help while doing this analysis. You should look at ways of
      changing the procedure by reducing variation and step complexity. Things to consider are: multi-
      ple review levels, rework, scrap, avoidable delays, and nonvalue added steps.
      4.5.1.10. After the procedure charts have been improved and streamlined, make the necessary
      changes and redo the charts. After the charts have been updated, go back and update the POD to
      reflect the new improved mode of operation.
      4.5.1.11. Begin measurement. Measure only the steps with an alpha character below the step num-
      ber. The study team should decide the best type of measurement for each step. The alpha charac-
      ters should show the type of OA measurement used. Place the measured time in the standard time
      (ST) block of the form. If a delay is involved in the task, include the time in the delay time (DT)
      column of the form. NOTE: Delay time does not always add measurable man-hours to a process,
      but is important to consider for process improvement.
      4.5.1.12. Identify steps that have conditional factors. These are measurable steps that do not occur
      in every cycle. Compute as follows:


                                        Percent of
              Original       x          Occurrence   =      Adjusted PAT
              PAT                       Adjustment


      Example:     100 minutes      x       .10      = 10 minutes


      4.5.1.13. After measurement has been completed, always re-check your frequency source of
      count and accuracy.
      4.5.1.14. Add the total step times for the process and transfer this total to the upper left corner of
      the first page of the FP charts.
   4.5.2. You do not have to follow these steps exactly to successfully complete a FP chart. The type of
   work center under study will determine if you can consolidate or eliminate certain steps.

4.6. MEO Development Using FP Charting.
126                                                            AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


      4.6.1. Work center MEOs can be developed very easily using FP charting because the work is broken
      down into small steps by person. This is done by first completing FP charts for each procedure or pro-
      cess within a work center under its current mode of operation. The main objective is to have a visual
      display of all work being performed by work center personnel. Remember that before you can
      improve or manage a process, you have to understand the process. Array the data for easy analysis.
      Now, the functional manager and study team should start reviewing and analyzing the data from an
      organizational standpoint. Examples of this type of analysis include the following:
         4.6.1.1. Why do separate branches perform the same type of work?
         4.6.1.2. Is there duplication of effort among branches?
         4.6.1.3. What are individual branch missions? Does the work performed support their mission?
         4.6.1.4. Who are external and internal customers?
         4.6.1.5. Are there excessive branch-level reviews on products or services with no real
         value-added?
         4.6.1.6. What is the cost of operating each branch versus the real benefits received?
         4.6.1.7. Have volume of work, equipment, and physical layout been considered?
      4.6.2. After this analysis is completed, any organizational inefficiencies should be apparent. With the
      help of the functional manager, determine the best way to modify the structure to be more responsive
      to the customer. After changes to the organizational structure have been recommended and approved,
      implement the new organizational structure. This will be the organizational structure used for measur-
      ing the function. Any changes should be made to the POD as well as the individual FP charts.
      4.6.3. Next, go through each process or procedure from a step standpoint and look at ways of chang-
      ing the process by reducing variation and step complexity. For each step in the process, consider the
      following:
         4.6.3.1. Why is it being performed?
         4.6.3.2. What value does it add to the overall product?
         4.6.3.3. Why is this person doing it?
         4.6.3.4. Who should be doing it?
         4.6.3.5. Are conditional factors built for rework or errors and does management know what the
         error rate is?
         4.6.3.6. Why are errors taking place?
         4.6.3.7. At what stage in the process do most of the errors occur?
         4.6.3.8. Are too many people looking at the same document?
         4.6.3.9. Can certain steps be automated?
         4.6.3.10. Can certain steps be eliminated?
         4.6.3.11. What are the governing publications for each step?
         4.6.3.12. Can any steps be simplified?
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                        127


   4.6.4. After analyzing each step, determine what the real problems are within the procedures and cor-
   rect them. Then redo the FP charts under the new or proposed mode of operation. This is in essence
   your MEO and should be documented as such.

4.7. Manpower Standard Development Using FP Charting. You can develop a manpower standard
using FP charting in a manner very similar to the OA method of measurement. Two ways to do this are as
follows:
   4.7.1. Statistical manpower standards using correlation and regression (C&R) analysis are developed
   by transferring FP chart procedure times to an AF Form 1040, Operational Audit Data. The follow-
   ing steps should take place:
       4.7.1.1. Determine the total time that one complete procedure takes. This total time should be
       located on the first page of the FP charts for each procedure. For example, the total time for Pro-
       cedure 2 (Processes Service Contract) is 300 man-hours.
       4.7.1.2. Normally, each separate procedure is a separate process of work, or separate step on the
       POD. For example, Process 2 on the Operational Contracting POD is: Processes Service Contract.
       This is the same as Procedure 2.
       4.7.1.3. Then determine how many service contracts were processed or awarded per month for the
       last 12 months. Let's assume we have an average of 10 service contracts awarded per month.
       4.7.1.4. Now, you would prepare an AF Form 1040 for each location, by completing the frequen-
       cies (10 per month), and PAT (300 man-hours), then computing total Process 2 man-hours (3000
       man-hours). Do this for each process to determine the total work center man-hours.
       4.7.1.5. At this point, regular C&R can be performed at the process level, step level, or for the
       total work center.
       4.7.1.6. Determine standard indirect allowed man-hours (SIAM) by using the SIAM data sheets
       published with AFMS 00AA. These man-hours can then be added to the man-hour equation for
       total work center requirements.
   4.7.2. Develop the "b" Coefficient. Functional modeling, as well as functional estimating equations,
   may also be used. If satisfactory statistics cannot be achieved with C&R analysis, simply use the aver-
   age total FP chart time (or total procedure time) as the "b" coefficient. An example is provided below.


   BASE      1     2     3     4     5      6     7     AVERAGE


   Pros 2
   PATs     315   320   280   275    290 305      300    297.86


   Equation format: Y = 297.86X2 (add SIAM man-hours)


   4.7.3. The other phases of the Manpower Standard Process remain the same.
128                                                              AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


4.8. Skill and Grade Matrix Development Using FP Charting. By identifying workload by position
on the FP chart, you can determine the percentage of work performed by each position and specialty, then
develop a skill and grade matrix. This is done by adding the total time per position from the FP chart for
a procedure, and then determining the procedure's total impact on the work center. For example, the Oper-
ational Contracting work center process 2 or procedure 2 would be presented as follows:
      4.8.1. Step 1. Time to process one Service Contract is 300 man-hours broken down by the following
      positions:


      POSITIONS            MAN-HOURS                  PERCENT OF
                         PER PROCEDURE                PROCEDURE
      Craft/6C0S1              200                        67%


      Supervisor/64PQ           70                        23%


      Admin/3A1S1               30                        10%
                               300                       100%


      4.8.2. Step 2. Determine the overall man-hour impact that Procedure 2 has on the work center. Let's
      assume that the work center measured a total of 5,000 monthly man-hours and Procedure 2 takes a
      total of 3,000 monthly man-hours (10 service contracts awarded per month x 300 man-hours per con-
      tract). In this case, Procedure 2 impact on the overall work center man-hours would be: 3,000 divided
      by 5,000 = 60%.
      4.8.3. Step 3. Now multiply Procedure 2 position percentages by its overall impact on the work center
      percentage to determine the overall percentage that should be allocated to each position.


      POSITIONS            PERCENT OF         POD PERCENT           PERCENT
                           PROCEDURE            IMPACT             ALLOCATED
      6C0S1                   67%                 60%                 40%
      64PQ                    23%                 60%                 14%
      3A1S1                   10%                  60%                 6%

      4.8.4. Step 4. Repeat this for each procedure in the work center that has been measured, making sure
      that the percents allocated account for 100% of the work center requirements.
      4.8.5. Step 5. There will be situations in which a position is comprised of 3, 5, and 7 level work. If this
      occurs, determine what percent is 3 level, 5 level, and 7 level prior to doing the calculations, and
      extrapolate this percent to the position percentages.
      4.8.6. Step 6. Consider officer grade ceilings and career progression factors when preparing the skill
      and grade matrix.

4.9. Functional Measures Tracking. Work center performance can be measured using the FP charts as
the standard procedure and time to perform work center processes. Effectiveness and efficiency indices
can be developed to track and measure performance. For example, the standard time to process a service
contract is 300 man-hours. Suppose the work center is taking 330 man-hours to process a service contract,
exceeding the standard allowed time by 10% (30 divided by 300 = 10%). Management should investigate
this variance to determine the causes for exceeding the standard time. Reference the chapter on perfor-
mance measures for specific details of how to develop performance indices.

                          FUNCTIONAL ESTIMATING EQUATIONS (FEE)

Section 5A—Forecasting Manpower Requirements

5.1. General Concepts. The purpose of this chapter is to show how work center manpower standards
form the basis for FEEs and how they are built. These equations are quantitative tools designed to be used
at all organizational levels to forecast manpower requirements. FEEs are optional and are used to supple-
ment other forecasting methods.

5.2. Air Force Program Element Structure.
      5.2.1. Manpower management personnel build the quantitative tools (models) needed to develop the
      manpower programming part of the planning, programming, and budgeting system. To be effective,
      these models must parallel the DoD programming system embodied in the Air Force part of the Future
      Years Defense Program (FYDP).
         5.2.1.1. The broadest and most basic structural element of the FYDP is the major force program.
         Major force programs (see Figure 5.1.) represent broad aggregations of smaller or specific mis-
         sions that are closely related.
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                         131

        11          Special Operations Forces
      5.2.1.2. Each major force program is subdivided into more specific mission breakdowns called
      program elements.
         5.2.1.2.1. Program elements represent a combination of manpower, equipment, and facilities
         that constitute a military capability or support activity. They give full descriptions of the mis-
         sion and are the smallest program cost-collection unit that OSD requires DoD components to
         furnish information on a regular basis. Program elements are used throughout DoD and they
         identify every type of organization.
         5.2.1.2.2. Each program element is identified by a program element code (PEC) consisting of
         six characters. The first character represents the Major Force Program. The first five charac-
         ters are always numeric (for example, 41896) except "a" used for MFP 10 and "b" used for
         MFP 11. The sixth is always alphabetic. At the DoD level, this sixth character identifies the
         DoD component (F means Air Force) (see Figure 5.2.). When used within the Air Force, this
         sixth character is replaced by other alphabetic characters (for example, 41896A, 41896B)
132                                                            AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


         other than F that is reserved for DoD use. This is done when it is necessary to shred-out the
         DoD PEC to account for resources at a lower level. Program element code shreds are estab-
         lished by HQ USAF/XPM.

         27236A includes work centers in 11XX Administration, 15XX Comptroller, 16XX Personnel,
         2XXX Maintenance, and 46XX Services (see Figure 5.3.).

   5.2.2. To meet the objective of building manpower forecasting tools, a FEE is built for each func-
   tional group within each MAJCOM.

Section 5B—Functional Estimating Equation Development

5.3. Building a FEE.
   5.3.1. Each FEE is made up of two major parts.
      5.3.1.1. A mathematical equation showing the relationship between the function's total manpower
      requirement and a selected program estimating factor (PEF). All of the PEFs are variables that are
      specifically programmed in the FYDP. The PEFs used to build FEEs are:
          5.3.1.1.1. Flying hours.
          5.3.1.1.2. Number of aircraft.
          5.3.1.1.3. Number of missiles.
          5.3.1.1.4. Students.
          5.3.1.1.5. Base population.

         mathematical equation, are in various PECs. There are also factors that further identify what part
         of a PEC's manpower requirements are in various manpower categories. These categories include
         officers, airmen, United States direct-hire civilians, foreign national direct-hire civilians, foreign
         national indirect-hire civilians, nonchargeable civilians on UAF but not in FYDP, and contract
         manpower equivalents (CME).
      5.3.2. Build at least one FEE for each functional area. Functional areas are defined by the first or first
      and second digit of Air Force FACs (for example, 5XXX defines the medical functional area while
      41XX defines the supply functional area). However, if manpower resources need to be programmed at
      a lower functional level (for example, 44EX), then build FEEs at these levels.
      5.3.3. Normally use regression analysis to build the mathematical equation of a FEE. This analysis
      uses the function's total required manpower and actual historical values for selected program estimat-
      ing factors from each relevant location in the MAJCOM.
         5.3.3.1. Make sure all mathematical equations are linear (bivariate or multivariate).
         5.3.3.2. Get the function's required manpower total at each location by applying all manpower
         standards that cover work centers in the function (use whole numbers for the manpower values).
             5.3.3.2.1. The monthly WLF values used in these applications are the result of analysis done
             on the 12 most current months of historical data. If 12 months of data is not available, use 6
             months of data at the minimum.
             5.3.3.2.2. Include in the function's total manpower requirements any CMEs that are relevant.
             Track these numbers separately on the Unit Manpower Document (UMD). They will eventu-
             ally be identified as a CME percentage factor.
         5.3.3.3. Use PEFs in FEEs like WLFs are used in work center manpower standards. PEF values
         are average monthly values obtained from analysis of historical data for each location in the MAJ-
         COM. Take this historical data from the same time period as the workload data used to apply the
         standards.
         5.3.3.4. See Table 5.1. for specific instructions for building the mathematical equation of a FEE
         by using regression analysis. An example of data used to build a FEE is shown in Figure 5.4..

     5.3.3.5. There are no classification categories for a FEE. However, a FEE built using regression
     analysis must satisfy the statistical criteria of the measurement method selected. (See Attachment
     2, Table 2.3., Data Source and Statistical Analysis for criteria.) If it does not, then use an equation
     in the form of Y = bX, where:


      Y = Manpower Requirements for a Functional Area


       b = Standard Application Requirements
           Historical Monthly PEF Value


       X = Programmed PEF Value


     5.3.3.6. When a FEE applies to four or less locations in a MAJCOM, build the mathematical
     equation for the FEE using instructions for the single location and small population standard in
     Chapter 11.
  5.3.4. Build the adjustment and percentage factors of a FEE using information from application of the
  work center standards, data found in the UMD, and values resulting from the development of the
  FEE’s mathematical equation.
     5.3.4.1. Compute the adjustment factor for each location in the MAJCOM (see Figure 5.5.). This
     value identifies how much each location's manpower requirement total, obtained from application
     of the function's manpower standards, is different from the manpower requirement total obtained
     from application of the FEE. Apply both the FEE and the standard to get this factor. Round the
     adjustment factor to three decimal places.

       centage factors needed for each base in a MAJCOM.
           5.3.4.2.1. The first are percentages of the total manpower requirements represented by each
           PEC. Percentages are needed for the overall function as well as for each work center in the

5.4. Using a FEE.
   5.4.1. FEEs project manpower requirements for a function. They can be applied at either base or
   MAJCOM level.
   5.4.2. PEC data used to apply a FEE always represents the fourth quarter value for a given fiscal year.
   5.4.3. How a FEE is applied depends on the level that the equation is used and whether zero-based or
   incremental requirements are being determined.

                                               FUNCTIONAL MODEL

6.1. Functional Model Uses.
      6.1.1. The functional model is a mathematical equation that relates the current distribution of man-
      power to a specific workload. The relationship may not provide accurate manpower requirements
      since the current distribution of manpower may not be correct.
      6.1.2. The functional model is a method used to develop manpower equations, estimate wartime
      requirements, and analyze potential workload factors.

6.2. Standards Development.
      6.2.1. Before model construction, analyze and adjust authorized and assigned data to reflect approved
      initiatives. An example of constructing a model and incorporating initiatives is shown in Figure 6.1..

Figure 6.1. Functional Model Standard Development.

 Functional model example:

 Step 1. Develop model equation using assigned or authorized man-hours as the dependent variable
 (Y). The decision to use authorized or assigned is made in consultation with the OPR. Regress this
 variable against six to twelve months of average workload.

Step 2. Equation Selection. Because the difference between authorized and assigned strength represents less than ten
percent of the total authorized, (77 - 76)/ 77 = 1.3%, and because the OPR did not state a preference, the authorized
man-hour equation was selected as the functional model because of the better statistics.
Step 3. Establish Baseline. Use selected equation to determine calculated man-hours. These calculated man-hours will be
used as the baseline for the functional model.

 This same procedure can be used when adjusting a single location manpower standard developed using regression
 analysis and historical data. In this instance, data from the different months would be adjusted rather than the different
 bases.


      6.2.2. The dependent variable (Y) used in the functional model may be either assigned or authorized
      man-hours. Convert assigned or authorized strength to man-hours by multiplying by the pertinent
      MAF and overload factor.
      6.2.3. Consult with the OPR and decide whether to use authorized or assigned man-hours. When there
      is a large difference between the two, discuss this disparity with the OPR, and select the proper depen-
      dent variable. Correlate the dependent variable with the independent workload variables.
      6.2.4. In situations where authorized and assigned man-hours are closely compatible, use the analysis
      of variation and correlation criteria to select the best dependent variable (Y). When these statistical
      criteria are used, assigned strengths should not differ from authorized strengths by more than 10 per-
      cent when input points are totaled.
      6.2.5. Make sure the minimum number of input locations is satisfied when developing the functional
      model.
      6.2.6. Use the selected equation to calculate required man-hours. Make sure a representative period of
      workload data is used to apply the equation. This sets up the man-hour data base for the first equation.
      After setting up the data base, subtract the man-hours saved due to initiatives. Regress adjusted
      man-hours against workload (same x-values) to develop the final man-hour equation.

6.3. Wartime Requirements Modeling.
      6.3.1. Periodically, wartime manpower requirements are estimated for each Air Force support activ-
      ity. MAJCOMs identify and document deployment requirements, in-place requirements, shortfalls,
      and untasked resources. Deployment requirements are based on force requirements identified in a
      force sizing exercise (such as Total Force Assessment) Time Phased Force Deployment Document.
      In-place manpower requirements are based on programmed wartime workload and wartime man-hour
      availability factors. The requirement data is grouped by specialty, skill, and manpower resource cate-
      gory.
      6.3.2. Construct a functional model for wartime based on the above manpower requirements and
      workload available from each MAJCOM. Follow the same procedures and sequence used for analyz-
      ing peacetime requirements.
      6.3.3. Use stated wartime manpower requirements as the dependent variable.
      6.3.4. Use wartime-related workload values as the independent variable.
      6.3.5. Analyze separate models for the two wartime populations.
         6.3.5.1. In-place units not deploying to a combat theater.
         6.3.5.2. Combat theater units and units deploying to a combat theater under a force sizing sce-
         nario.

   6.3.6. When using a functional model for wartime requirements pending standards development, fur-
   nish this additional information.
      6.3.6.1. Specialty and skill requirements.
      6.3.6.2. Functional statement of wartime responsibilities. Get responsibilities from the functional
      guidance included in the United States Air Force War and Mobilization Plan, Volume 1; Base Sup-
      port Plan, Volumes 1 and 2; and Total Force Assessment guidance.

6.4. Using a Functional Model to Analyze Potential Workload Factors.
   6.4.1. During study familiarization, use the functional model to analyze potential WLFs. The size of
   the standard error and the number of extreme deviations from the line often show the degree of relat-
   ability. Other means of evaluation such as activity analysis charts, discussions with the functional
   OPR, and logical analysis help refine the list of potential workload factors.
   6.4.2. The following steps identify the procedures which should be followed when using a functional
   model to analyze potential workload factors:
      6.4.2.1. Step 1. Pick the work center or functional area to be analyzed.
      6.4.2.2. Step 2. Pick candidate workload and program variables that logically relate to manpower
      authorizations in the UMD and for data available from programming documents or formal reports.
      6.4.2.3. Step 3. Get the manpower data from the UMD for each location and time period under
      consideration. Use the volume of the selected variables for the same time periods.
      6.4.2.4. Step 4. Analyze data.
          6.4.2.4.1. Check manpower and workload data with the functional OPR and revise any data
          that both parties agree is incorrect.
          6.4.2.4.2. Plot the data pairs on a scattergram and analyze the relative position of each plot
          with respect to a trend or pattern of the overall display. Prepare the plot manually or by com-
          puter.
          6.4.2.4.3. Do regression analysis to find the relationship between manpower authorizations
          and the candidate workload variables. Regression analysis procedures and interpretation of the
          results are in Chapter 2.
          6.4.2.4.4. Investigate any extreme deviation in the data points. The purpose of this investiga-
          tion is to find whether a high standard error (deviation) is due to management design or
          well-documented reasons. If so, include those reasons as part of the functional model backup
          data. Typical reasons are: mixed data from different organizational levels, incorrectly defined
          FACs, and organizational structure codes, geographic population differences, use of contract
          services at some locations, differences in management philosophy and personnel utilization,
          organizational structure differences, and lack of a quantitative relationship between manpower
          and the tested workload variables. The investigation should give some clues to the expected
          benefit of alternative study approaches. A full study of the functions at selected locations may
          be needed to identify the reasons for large deviations. Separate standards may be needed to
          show multiple populations that are shown by the scattergram.

       6.4.2.5. Step 5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 to evaluate alternative workload variables. Additional
       models using assigned strength or wartime manpower distributions instead of authorizations may
       give more insight into manpower requirements, variations by location or condition, and potential
       WLFs. For example, analysis of assigned strength and the historical workload relate to a produc-
       tivity index and show the work done by expended manpower. Given consistent workload and effi-
       cient operations, expended resources should relate to future requirements. Models are also
       valuable for analyzing the potential differences that may need different populations for standard
       coverage.

6.5. Example of a Functional Model. Figure 6.2. is an example of a functional model. Note that the
equation and all data points are plotted for ease of analysis. The functional model shown doesn't show a
good relationship between manpower and the tested workload variable. Although this relationship doesn't
require discarding the potential WLF, it does show the absence of a strong relationship.

       MINIMUM MANPOWER, STANDBY DETERMINATION, AND MAN-HOUR SHIFT
                            PROFILE ANALYSIS

Section 7A—Minimum Manpower

7.1. General Concepts.
      7.1.1. Importance of Minimum Manpower and Standby. Management decisions often produce mini-
      mum manpower levels that drive standby time. Since all standby time included in a manpower stan-
      dard is nonproductive and costly, it must be justified. Mission-essential standby time is allowed in
      manpower studies; however, to merely show the computations used to derive standby time is not
      enough. Validate management decisions leading to minimum manpower requirements and associated
      standby time.
      7.1.2. Standby Levels.
         7.1.2.1. Standby, delay, and on-call time are defined in Attachment 1, Terms. Standby time can
         occur at any workload volume, and minimum manpower requirements may change from location
         to location.
         7.1.2.2. Figure 7.1. is a Venn Diagram that depicts minimum manpower requirements at low
         (case 1) and high (case 2) workload volumes. In both cases, the minimum manpower requirements
         are considered constant and are represented by circles of the same size. In case 1, the minimum
         manpower requirement is equal to the total man-hours available to do work, that is, the universe is
         equal to man-hours required by minimum manpower requirements. Standby is the difference
         between man-hours required by minimum manpower and man-hours required by productive
         work.
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                        153


Figure 7.1. Depiction of Input Measurement Data.




      7.1.2.3. In case 2, Figure 7.1., the minimum manpower requirement is less than total man-hours
      available for productive work. That is, the universe is equal to total hours available to do produc-
      tive work. Derivation of standby in this case is more difficult.
      7.1.2.4. Figure 7.2. shows another situation similar to Figure 7.1.. In situation I, bases A and B
      whose workload volume is less than Xi, represent a case 1 situation. Bases C, D, and E whose
      workload volume is greater than Xi, represent case 2. For case 1 (bases A and B), derive standby
      time as shown in the previous paragraph. At bases C, D, and E, however, this procedure cannot be
      applied. In situation II, bases A and C represent a case 1 situation.

Figure 7.2. Minimum Manpower Relationships.




         7.1.2.5. Minimum manpower requirements may be constant for each shift (Figure 7.1. and Fig-
         ure 7.2., A, show this condition), or they may vary with workload volume. Figure 7.2., B, shows
         minimum manpower at two levels: one for workload volumes less than Xi, and one for workload
         volumes greater than Xi. This situation is possible, for example, in an aircraft loading operation
         where a second load crew is needed to meet specified turnaround or ground time. Note in Figure
         7.2., B, that bases A and C on the chart show varying amounts of standby time. The standby time
         is derived and computed as part of the allowed man-hours. It is not dependent on the regression
         line.
         7.1.2.6. When the regression equation excludes standby time, a particular location may not have
         enough man-hours to cover the directed standby requirement. This location would receive credit
         for either the computed man-hours or measured man-hours (work center man-hours plus standby),
         whichever is greater. This standby time is referred to as derived standby. Document the minimum
         manpower condition in the application instructions in the manpower standard.
      7.1.3. Observations Regarding Standby Time.
         7.1.3.1. Minimum manpower requirements may be the same at all locations or may change with
         workload volume.
         7.1.3.2. Identify minimum manpower requirements by MEP work measurement methods if levels
         of service are properly defined before measurement.
         7.1.3.3. Allow only standby necessary for mission accomplishment.
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                           155


      7.1.3.4. Reduce standby time by transferring productive work to replace measured standby
      man-hours.
      7.1.3.5. Classify standby work inherent in one's assigned duty (for example, a craftsman continu-
      ously observing instruments) as productive work.

7.2. Rationale for Minimum Manpower.
   7.2.1. Contributing Factors. Numerous factors contribute to establishing minimum manpower
   requirements. Some of these factors, often a result of management decisions, are:
      7.2.1.1. Mission needs.
      7.2.1.2. Performance standards.
      7.2.1.3. Machine design.
      7.2.1.4. Facility limitations.
      7.2.1.5. Hours of operation.
      7.2.1.6. Shift size and necessity.
      7.2.1.7. Crew size.
      7.2.1.8. Post-manpower requirements.
      7.2.1.9. Safety.
      7.2.1.10. Security.
   7.2.2. Evaluating Minimum Manpower Requirements. Carefully check the need for minimum man-
   power. Question the basic need. Offer alternatives and clearly define the cost of such service. Study
   documentation must contain rationale to justify minimum manpower requirements. After the func-
   tional OPR confirms minimum manpower requirements, quantifying standby time is generally
   straightforward. Reduce or minimize standby time through improved shift scheduling, reorganization,
   planning, and workload control techniques. MEP personnel must be ready to show the manager how
   to meet the needed performance standards with minimum standby time. When standby time is mini-
   mized, the total manpower requirement is also minimized.
   7.2.3. Minimum Manpower Computations.
      7.2.3.1. In those situations that meet the criteria, you can use the minimum manpower factor
      (MMF) method to develop a standard. This method uses predetermined manpower factors to com-
      pute manpower requirements for an OPR-approved position. Compute the factor by dividing the
      man-hours for position coverage by the pertinent man-hour availability factor (MAF) times the
      overload factor (for military). Adjust the MAF to allow for additional man-hours associated with
      position coverage. These additional man-hours fall into two categories.
          7.2.3.1.1. The first category consists of man-hours needed for processes that must be done
          either before or after the position coverage starts. In the case of security police guard posts, for
          example, the security police officer must get a weapon and ammunition from the armory and
          attend guard mount before assuming the post. Likewise, at the end of the shift, the officer must
          turn in the weapon and ammunition to the armory. The time associated with this work is in
          addition to the time needed for post duty and should be measured as such.

         7.2.3.1.2. The second category of additional man-hours consists of recurring training time
         needed to keep an individual qualified to fill the position. This is training that cannot be
         received while the individual is actually on position duty. An example of this type of training
         is proficiency or refresher training needed by all security police officers such as weapons train-
         ing. Before developing a special allowance, make sure such training has not already been cred-
         ited in the MAF.
         7.2.3.1.3. When additional allowances are given for these two types of position-related
         man-hours, derive the man-hours used in computing the allowances from work measurement.
      7.2.3.2. To compute required manpower, divide the position coverage in man-hours by the MAF
      times the overload factor. For example, a position requiring coverage 7 days a week (including
      holidays), 24 hours a day, by one individual generates a requirement for 730.464 monthly
      man-hours. If the work force is military, on a 40-hour workweek, the manpower requirement is
      4.476 (730.464/(151.5 x 1.077)). However, if the work force is military on a 6-day, 60-hour work-
      week, the manpower factor is 2.971 (730.464/(245.9 x 1.012)). These numbers, 4.476 and 2.971,
      are minimum manpower factors. Standby time is normally an inherent part of positions based on
      minimum manpower factor application, such as security police assigned to a base access gate and
      firefighters.
      7.2.3.3. Use this equation to compute minimum manpower factors. Use continuous calculations,
      i.e., don't round until all calculations are done.
      MMF = (Days/Wk)(Hrs/Day)(4.348 Wks/Mo*)(DRF**) (Crew Size)
               Man-hour Available Factor x Overload Factor
      *Use the pertinent weekly conversion factor based on the number of days per week and whether or
      not federal holidays are worked. (See Table 9.2.)
      **The directed requirement factor (DRF) is a constant man-hour requirement directed by higher
      headquarters policy in addition to duties for a minimum manpower situation. The DRF is equal to
      1.000 unless the work is not part of the duties for a minimum manpower situation. For example, if
      each person must receive 2.50 hours per month of proficiency or refresher training, and training
      cannot be received while the person is on the job, then compute the DRF as follows:
       DRF = 1+ [(T/(MAF-T)]
       where T = required training hours
       If T = 2.5 and MAF = 151.5, then
       DRF = 1 + [2.5/(151.5 - 2.5)] = 1.017
      When the DRF and crew size are both equal to 1, the minimum manpower factor values are the
      same as the post manning factor values identified in AFI 38-201.
      7.2.3.4. Furnish the minimum manpower factor computations per paragraph 7.2.3.3. as backup.
      7.2.3.5. Certain functions such as security police need adjustments to these procedures. In this
      case, compute a minimum manpower requirement for each position; sum the minimum manpower
      requirements; and, round up to whole manpower requirements. For example, a small Air Force
      base in Texas has three gates. Main gate duties are assumed by two security police officers, 24
      hours a day, 7 days a week. East gate duties are assumed by one security police officer, 8 hours a
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                          157


     day, 5 days a week. West gate duties are assumed by one security police officer, 4 hours a day (all
     in one shift), 5 days a week. The east and west gates are closed for holidays (10 days a year). The
     security police work center that has the mission of providing manpower for these gates is on a
     40-hour workweek. Position-coverage associated work requires 0.669 hours per shift as deter-
     mined by work measurement (see para 7.2.3.1.1. for explanation) and recurring training that can-
     not be done while at the positions requires 5.40 hours per month per person. The total manpower
     requirement for these three gates is as follows:
        7.2.3.5.1. Calculate the DRF for training.


            DRF = 1 + [T/(MAF - T)] = 1 + [5.40/(MAF - 5.40)]


        Since the MAF for a military 40-hour workweek is 151.5,


            DRF = 1 + [5.40/(151.5 - 5.40)] = 1.037.


        Apply this factor to the total man-hours required to fill the post, that is, to both the basic posi-
        tion coverage and the position-coverage associated work. Since the main gate has three shifts,
        the total daily man-hours for position-coverage associated work is 3(0.669) = 2.007. Adding
        this result to the 24 man-hours of position coverage per day equals 26.007. This result (26.007)
        is the entry for the "hours/day" item in the MMF formula for the main gate.


         MMF = (Days/Wk)(Hrs/Day)(4.348 Wks/Mo)(DRF)(Crew Size)
                  Man-hour Available Factor x Overload Factor


         MMF = (7)(26.007)(4.348)(1.037) (2) = 10.061
                     151.5 x 1.077


        7.2.3.5.2. East gate duties are assumed by one security police officer, 8 hours a day, 5 days a
        week. This position coverage only needs one shift so the total entry for the "hours/day" item in
        the minimum manpower factor formula is 8 + 0.669 = 8.669. But there is another problem.
        This position is not filled during holidays (10 days a year), and the conversion factor (4.348
        weeks/month) will add unneeded man-hours to the position coverage because it includes holi-
        days. Derive this conversion factor as follows:


        365.25 days/Yr - weekend days not worked - federal holidays not worked = duty days/year


         duty days/year / 12 months = duty days/month
158                                                     AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003



      duty days/month / normal duty days/week = weekly conversion factor


      Since position coverage does not include holidays, do not add a false cost. Therefore, replace
      this conversion factor with a new one that does not include the 10 holidays as follows:


       365.25 days/year - 104.36 (weekend days not worked) - 10 (federal holidays) = 250.89 duty
      days/year


      250.89 / 12 = 20.9075


      20.9075 / 5 (normal duty days/week) = 4.182 weeks/Mo


      Now the minimum manpower factor formula for the east gate is:


      MMF = (Days/Wk)(Hrs/Day)(4.182 Wks/Mo)(DRF) (Crew Size)
                 Man-hour Available Factor x Overload Factor


      MMF = (5)(8.669)(4.182)(1.037) (1) = 1.152
                  151.5 x 1.077


      7.2.3.5.3. West gate duties are assumed by one security police officer, 4 hours a day, 5 days
      per week. The gate is closed on holidays. Although 4 hours is not a complete shift, 0.669 hours
      are still associated with the shift because the same work would apply to a partial shift as to a
      whole shift. The entry for the hours per day item in the minimum manpower factor formula is
      4.669, and the MMF is calculated as follows:




      MMF = (Days/Wk)(Hrs/Day)(4.182 Wks/Mo)(DRF)(Crew Size)
                 Man-hour Available Factor x Overload Factor


      MMF = (5)(4.669)(4.182)(1.037) (1) = 0.620
                  151.5 x 1.077
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                       159


          7.2.3.5.4. To find total manpower requirement for assuming the duties for the three gates, add
          the three MMFs: 10.061 + l.152 + 0.620 = 11.833. Round 11.833 up to 12 manpower require-
          ments.
       7.2.3.6. When determining minimum manpower factors for multiple posts of the same make-up in
       hours of operation, crew size, DRF, etc., compute the minimum manpower equation for a single
       post and multiply the result by the number of posts authorized for the function under study.
       7.2.3.7. Document minimum manpower as follows:
          7.2.3.7.1. When the minimum manpower computation is not the sole measurement method for
          the work center, compute the man-hours by multiplying the rounded minimum manpower
          requirement by the pertinent MAF multiplied by the overload factor.
          7.2.3.7.2. When the minimum manpower computation is the sole measurement method for the
          work center, furnish only the minimum manpower factor computation. There is no need to
          convert the rounded minimum manpower into man-hours.

Section 7B—Standby Determination with Man-Hour Collection Method

7.3. Study Design.
   7.3.1. A well-designed study accurately shows minimum manpower requirements and true standby
   time. The measurement plan tells how to measure minimum manpower requirements and how to iden-
   tify standby time. Necessary standby man-hours cannot be identified during standards development,
   when it is grouped in with other nonproductive categories of time and when the minimum manpower
   requirements have not been accurately documented.
   7.3.2. Clearly define the method for measuring standby when the possibility of standby time exists.
   Use MEP standard data collection and work measurement procedures to identify standby; however,
   some innovation is needed with these methods. Do not simply state queuing or shift profile analysis
   will be used to quantify standby time; tell how inputs use these techniques. Standby time is discussed
   in conjunction with various data collection and analysis procedures in the paragraphs that follow.
   7.3.3. Include standby time computed according to procedures of this section as input to regression
   analysis when developing the standard man-hour equation. Build a variance for applicable locations if
   standby time does not exist at all locations.

7.4. Data Collection and Analysis Procedures. Use a man-hour shift profile chart to aid in analyzing
standby time when work sampling or queuing is used and standby time exists (see Section 7C).
   7.4.1. Queuing Analysis. Queuing data does not directly identify allowed standby time. The percent-
   age of server time in productive direct work may be determined with the queuing utilization factor
   after an acceptable level of service has been determined (for example, the number of taxi drivers
   needed to give a 4 minute response time). Queuing also shows when servers are not busy, including
160                                                            AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


      standby time. Design the study to collect queuing data on standby time if queuing is used. Details
      describing queuing techniques are in Chapter 16.
      7.4.2. Work Sampling.
         7.4.2.1. Identify standby time during Work Sampling observation rounds when minimum man-
         power requirements are previously defined. For example, suppose a finance office requires that
         customers with pay inquiries be waited on within 30 minutes of customer arrival. It has been pre-
         determined that two finance clerks are necessary to give this level of service at the finance counter
         between 0900 and 1500.
         7.4.2.2. Make provisions to isolate and identify the required standby time when the work sampler
         knows this information before the study begins. On each observation round, the work sampler
         records each worker in the respective process. The observer may enter a maximum of two standby
         tallies during each observation round but this would occur only if both service clerks were await-
         ing customers.
         7.4.2.3. Use standby time derived in this manner to show management the manpower cost of pro-
         viding this level of service. Analysis of WS observation sheets and waiting time data (for example,
         the time finance customers actually wait for service) may reveal that the specified level of service
         has been exceeded or that the second server is needed only during peak periods, such as pay days.
         7.4.2.4. Standby time collected in this manner represents adjusted or derived standby time
         required to support a predetermined level of service. Record it on an AF Form 308, Standard
         Input Data Computation, per Table 7.1.. However, if the level of service is not clearly defined,
         it is impossible to identify whether the worker should be sampled as idle or standby. Build a
         man-hour shift profile chart to find required standby when this is the case.

         7.4.3.1. Include enough rationale in the final report to support the minimum manpower require-
         ment when using OA as the primary work measurement method. It is not necessary to measure
         standby time if the minimum manpower requirement represents the total man-hour universe as in
         case 1, Figure 7.1..
         7.4.3.2. Minimize and fully explain all standby allowed in the study when the total man-hour uni-
         verse is greater than the minimum manpower requirement (case 2, Figure 7.1.). Developing a
         man-hour shift profile chart from OA measurement may be difficult because process times are not
         associated with each hour of the duty day. Therefore, consider using short-cycle WS to collect
         man-hours for a man-hour shift profile chart. Use the WS as back-up for the OA man-hours. Sec-
         tion 7C describes procedures for the man-hour shift profile chart.

Section 7C—Man-Hour Shift Profile Analysis

7.5. Introduction to the Man-Hour Shift Profile Chart. Man-hour shift profile charts are an effective
way to identify and minimize standby time. They aid the analyst in defining the minimum essential man-
power levels by:
      7.5.1. Leveling workloads to economize on nonproductive standby periods.
      7.5.2. Identifying minimum standby time based on the accepted level of service.

7.6. Use of the Man-Hour Shift Profile Chart.
      7.6.1. The man-hour shift profile chart helps functional managers realize economies of operation and
      helps MEP personnel build accurate manpower standards. Use this process as a data analysis tech-
      nique during management consultant studies or with other data collection methods during a man-
      power standards study.
      7.6.2. The man-hour shift profile is used by manpower management personnel to justify standby
      requirements. Input teams use the chart to find the proper amounts of standby time to include in mea-
      surement reports when:
         7.6.2.1. Queuing analysis is the primary standard development technique, or
         7.6.2.2. WS is the primary work measurement method and standby time cannot be distinguished
         from other nonproductive categories during the sampling period.

7.7. How to Develop the Present Man-Hour Shift Profile Chart.
      7.7.1. Only construct the profile chart from data obtained during work measurement if certain provi-
      sions are taken during data collection. That is, collect data so it can be summarized by process on a
      stratified time basis (normally, hour-by-hour).
      7.7.2. Identify work in the POD as transferable and nontransferable when a man-hour shift profile
      chart is needed. This helps in making the shift profile chart that shows productive work for the strati-
      fied time increments.
      7.7.3. The basic steps in developing man-hour shift profile charts are collecting necessary data, doing
      end-of-study computations, and constructing the chart. Derive the average man-hours for each hour of
      the day that are used in the profile chart from queuing analysis or from WS data. When using the shift
      profile chart to minimize standby time, make sure the sample size is large enough to support recom-
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                       163


  mendations based on the profile chart. The procedures for developing a shift profile chart using WS
  data follow:
     7.7.3.1. Accumulate the transferable and nontransferable time on a daily basis for each hour or
     half-hour of each shift. Average this time for the study period. Extract this time from the AF Form
     1157, Work Sampling Recapitulation. On some occasions, a separate WS study may be needed
     to develop the profile chart. When this is so, take enough samples to reach desired accuracy and
     collect only the productive time. Classify the productive work into transferable or nontransferable
     work. Consult work center personnel to make this classification if the POD has not been marked.
     7.7.3.2. Construct the present man-hour shift profile chart on graph paper (see Figure 7.3.) as fol-
     lows:

          7.7.3.2.1. Identify average man-hours per hour on the vertical axis.
          7.7.3.2.2. Identify each stratified period for each shift (hour or half hour) on the horizontal
          axis.
          7.7.3.2.3. Extend a vertical line downward from the duty hour corresponding to each shift
          change, and state the minimum manpower requirement for that shift.
          7.7.3.2.4. Plot, from bottom to top, the average nontransferable and transferable man-hours
          computed for each stratified period.
          7.7.3.2.5. Identify the nontransferable and transferable time within each stratified period. Col-
          ored pencils are helpful in this identification when the charts do not have to be reproduced.
          7.7.3.2.6. Group the various periods that make up each existing shift. Find the largest require-
          ment within each shift and extend a dark horizontal line over the entire shift.
          7.7.3.2.7. Extend vertical lines from each stratified period up to the next whole hour above the
          plots for transferable time. When there is only nontransferable time within the strata, extend
          the vertical line from that plot to the next whole hour. The extended portion of the column is
          potential standby time. In most cases, the total man-hours per shift period include both poten-
          tial standby time and other nonproductive time.
          7.7.3.2.8. Prepare a legend for the chart that identifies nontransferable, transferable, standby
          time, and other nonproductive time.

7.8. How to Analyze the Man-Hour Shift Profile Chart.
   7.8.1. Shift profile analysis can point out deficiencies in scheduling practices, or it can point out
   excessive minimum manpower levels. Further study of the actual shift profile chart may lead to addi-
   tional benefits such as more efficient choices for shift hours.
   7.8.2. Input teams analyze the actual shift profile chart to find the proper adjustments to make to
   standby time before constructing the proposed shift profile chart. An analysis of the chart may show
   the need for overlapping or split shifts. Although split shifts are sometimes necessary, they should be
   kept to a minimum. During analysis, remember:
      7.8.2.1. An evenly spread workload often reduces manpower needs.
      7.8.2.2. A related work center with standby man-hours may be able to accept some transferable
      work. This can take place only if the work can be done by the individuals receiving the work.
      7.8.2.3. Adjustments to existing standby time should be coordinated with local OPRs. Adjust-
      ments must not add man-hours to exceed the stated level of service.
   7.8.3. Study teams analyze the charts sent by measurement teams. A large amount of standby time at
   one location may mean a variance is needed at that location. On the other hand, it may mean the input
   team did not properly adjust the standby time. The study team must not adjust standby time without
   coordinating with the input team. This prevents dual adjustments of the same time. The study team
   does not average or prorate standby time during data analysis.

   mended time movements.

7.9. How to Develop the Proposed Man-Hour Shift Profile Chart. Construct a proposed shift profile
chart when an improvement can be made to the actual shift profile. Construct this chart the same way as
the present profile chart, but do it in conjunction with the analysis step. The proposed chart often uncovers
faults with analysis of the present profile chart. These steps tell how to develop a proposed profile chart
(see Figure 7.5.).

   7.9.1. Step 1. For purposes of this example, assume that the prestated minimum manpower required
   for the A and B shift is two and the minimum manpower required for the C shift is one. The proposed
168                                                            AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


      chart must accommodate this minimum manpower requirement.
      7.9.2. Step 2. Examine the present man-hour shift profile. In Figure 7.3., examination shows large
      standby and nonproductive time within shifts A and B. This is a logical place to look for improve-
      ments.
      7.9.3. Step 3. Experiment with different arrangements by moving transferable man-hours into periods
      with large amounts of standby. Move the transferable time to nearby hours within the same shift if
      possible. The objective is to reduce the nonproductive time that results when each column on the chart
      is extended up to the total man-hours required per shift line.
      7.9.4. Step 4. Experiment with different shift hours or with overlapping shifts to reduce nonproduc-
      tive time. Consider this possibility when a large man-hour required per shift column exists near a pro-
      posed shift change period. Figure 7.5., Man-Hour Shift Profile, Proposed, shows where transferable
      man-hours were moved within the same shift. Figure 7.6., Proposed Shift Schedule, shows how over-
      lapping shifts were used to reduce man-hours required per shift.
      7.9.5. Step 5. Compute the derived standby time from the proposed chart.

7.11. Wartime Operation Measurement. Functions having definite wartime capability requirements
supported by Air Force policy are prime candidates for minimum manpower factor manning. Examples of
these functions include aircraft security, perimeter defense, and tactical air control system operations.
Fully explain the use and justification of minimum manpower factor manning. Quantify standby
man-hours and use them to accomplish associated work of another work center or processes of work
driven by other than minimum manpower factor manning requirements. Consider using standby time
between work centers when minimum manpower factor manning is used.

pling, operational audit, time study, and other specialized measurement methods. Use the form to add

      7.12.2. The derivation of standby is shown in Figure 7.7.. In this figure, the difference between the
      total allowed time and the minimum man-hour requirement is standby time. Derive standby time for
      work sampling studies with the man-hour shift profile chart. Attach the standby computation to the

      computation in Part Four of the final report when AF Form 308 is not used.

                                         MODULAR EQUATIONS

8.1. General Concepts. Modular equations are a series of separate equations rather than one single equa-
tion. These individual equations represent independent processes that comprise the required man-hours
for the work center. While this type of representation is not right, nor needed for every work center, it does
give visibility to the required man-hours for a work center by process. Attributes of the modular equation
to consider are:
      8.1.1. Develop modular equations for individual processes that represent different levels of service
      furnished to the customer. Based on these level of service modules, the OPR has the flexibility to
      choose the pertinent module for a given location or situation.
      8.1.2. As work center requirements change (processes added, deleted, or modified), change the indi-
      vidual modules (insert or remove) to show the new work center requirements. This makes it relatively
      easy and cost-effective to maintain the standard.
      8.1.3. By virtue of design, calculate a "man-hour cost" associated with each process when using mod-
      ular equations.
      8.1.4. Modular equations make it easy to analyze a work center for "what-ifs."
      8.1.5. Represent individual processes not performed at all locations with a standard at the process
      level. Development of variances is therefore eliminated.

8.2. Specific Design Considerations.
      8.2.1. The first and perhaps the most critical step in using a modular equation in standards develop-
      ment is the initial research. Carefully research the nature and function of the work center to determine
      the suitability and feasibility of describing the work center as a composite of independent processes.
      Use the modular equations procedure only when the man-hours needed for a work center can be sub-
      divided into independent modules of work that account for all man-hours. These modules may repre-
      sent one or more processes as defined in a POD. Limit the number of modules to a minimum to reduce
      the complexity involved in using such a standard.
         8.2.1.1. A module of work is independent if it can be added to or removed from the work center
         without imposing an increase or decrease in man-hours in another module. Thus, it can be consid-
         ered a module in a modular equation. To rephrase this idea of independence, a work center that
         needs a given number of hours to do the work within module A is not expected to experience a
         change in these hours due to increases or decreases in the work in module B.
         8.2.1.2. See Figure 8.1. for a simplistic example indicating a potential use for POD processes in
         a modular equation.
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                          173


Figure 8.1. Simplistic Example Relationship Between POD and Modular Equation Processes.




          8.2.1.2.1. In Figure 8.1., POD processes 3 and 5 are not independent because the amount of
          time needed to keep bench stock is related to the number of engines to be repaired. Therefore,
          if the workload is increased in process 3 (that is, more engines to be repaired), the work in both
          processes would increase. In a modular equation, consider these two processes (and possibly
          others) in one general process - engine repair.
          8.2.1.2.2. POD process 4 is independent of processes 3 and 5 since periodic inspections are
          done on all engines. The addition (or deletion) of the work would not change the hours needed
          to do engine repair or keep bench stock supplies. Represent this process with a different mod-
          ule in the modular equation.
   8.2.2. Each module must have at least one workload factor that is logically and statistically related to
   the work described.
   8.2.3. Each module must meet the minimum number of input locations.
      8.2.3.1. Include as modules of work only those that are present in at least five of the work center
      locations. Any fewer is considered a variance or a small population.
      8.2.3.2. Each module must meet the minimum number of locations for measurement according to
      AFMAN 38-208, Volume 1, Table 3.4.
      8.2.3.3. Measure some locations with all modules present. This produces a more accurate state-
      ment of the required work. This procedure tends to reduce the number of variances needed for the
      standard.

8.3. Indirect Man-Hours.
   8.3.1. When Operational Audit is the primary measurement method, use SIAMs to credit indirect
   man-hours. Use SIAMs to form a separate indirect module. Represent this with an equation that
   expresses the indirect man-hours as a function of the direct man-hours. This can either be a linear or
   parabolic equation. The indirect equation remains separate from the equations for direct work and is
   applied only after the direct work is computed. This procedure sets a relationship between indirect and
174                                                            AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


      direct work. Indirect man-hours (Y) are regressed against direct man-hours (X) for each of the input
      bases. You can develop your SIAM factor as follows:


Y = (a+bx)(SIAM Factor)


SIAM Factor = 1 + Measured Indirect Man - Hours
                  Measured Direct Man - Hours


      8.3.2. When work sampling is the primary measurement method in multi-location modular studies,
      use measured indirect man-hours to form a separate indirect module. Represent this with an equation
      that expresses the indirect man-hours as a function of the direct man-hours. Equation development
      and procedures outlined for operational audit also apply to work sampling.
      8.3.3. The b-value in the linear case represents the proportion of indirect time to direct time. Figure
      8.2. shows relationships between direct and indirect percentages. Use this information as a guide. In
      Figure 8.3., a typical indirect equation was computed to be: Yind = -15.9354 + .1829 (Ydir). This
      allows an additional 18% (approximately) of the direct time for indirect work.

   8.3.4. The a-value determines the line with this slope (the b-value) to use. A negative a-value (as in
   the example above) does not mean that there is an automatic loss of man-hours. As in any equation,
   consider the a-value only in combination with the rest of the equation. For a given amount of direct
   work (for instance 950 hours), compute the hours added for indirect work from the indirect equation.


   Yc = -15.9354 + (.1829)(950.0) = 157.82



8.4. Developing Modular Equations.
   8.4.1. After a work center has met specific design considerations, develop a modular equation as fol-
   lows:
      8.4.1.1. Step 1. Identify all work center outputs (customer needed products or services). For each
      output, develop a task list of the process or processes needed to produce the unit of work (output).
      For each output, identify a work unit (end item). Using the output task lists, develop a POD so that
      each independent process becomes a module and each module has its own work unit. Structure the
      modules to account for all of the work described in the POD. Be certain each process is included
      in one and only one module. Identify the relationship between the modules and the associated
      workload factors. To avoid confusion during equation computation, clearly specify all relation-
      ships from the beginning.
      8.4.1.2. Step 2. Proceed with the measurement in the usual manner to collect all of the needed
      man-hours and workload counts. Use normal procedures for data collection and examination.
      8.4.1.3. Step 3. Aggregate the data to the levels necessary for the separate modules.
      8.4.1.4. Step 4. Do regression analysis for each module using procedures in Chapter 2. Keep the
      statistics (R², Syx, V) with each equation.

   8.4.3. An alternative to developing modular equations as described above is to use ratio unit times.
   The a-values (fixed man-hours) are developed by computing the mean fixed man-hours of all of the
   measurement locations. The b-values (variable man-hours) are developed by computing the mean
   ratio unit times of all of the measurement locations.

                                      OPERATIONAL AUDIT (OA)

9.1. General Concepts.
      9.1.1. The OA measurement method uses activity time values at the process step level. Find these val-
      ues by the mathematical model T = fiti, where T is the man-hours for activity; fi is the activity fre-
      quency, and ti is the per accomplishment time (PAT).
      9.1.2. Use the OA method to set standards in practically any type of work center (production, admin-
      istration, supervision, etc.).
      9.1.3. Also use the OA method to supplement work sampling or time study methods to:
         9.1.3.1. Find time values for work not perfomed during the sampling period.
         9.1.3.2. Document requirements for specific processes not suitable for time study due to low fre-
         quency or long duration when time study is the primary method.
      9.1.4. OA uses four primary data sources: historical records, directed requirement, good operator tim-
      ing, and technical estimate. Each of these OA techniques is defined as follows:
         9.1.4.1. Historical Records Technique. The determination of step frequency or PAT by checking
         documented past work performances of the work center.
         9.1.4.2. Directed Requirement Technique. This technique recognizes and allows some full-time
         positions established by regulation such as commander or first sergeant. Directed requirements
         may also apply to directed frequencies, such as monthly inspections, or to directed time values,
         such as the periodic run-up of a standby electrical power generator.
         9.1.4.3. Good Operator Timing Technique. A technique that establishes time values by measuring
         the time a qualified individual expends on a given activity.
         9.1.4.4. Technical Estimate Technique. The determination of the standard hours needed for a
         given process step, based on an estimate made by individuals technically and professionally com-
         petent to judge the needed time.
      9.1.5. OA facilitates standards maintenance.

9.2. Preparing for OA Measurement.
      9.2.1. The measuring craftsman must prepare in advance for OA to ensure the accuracy and validity
      of the data.
      9.2.2. Check the POD and SOC with work center personnel. Make sure the craftsman and work center
      supervisor both understand the work to be measured, standards of operation, and variations existing at
      the specific measurement site.
      9.2.3. Get all workload values for the period specified in the measurement plan. Usually 12 months of
      data is needed; however, the study team makes sure that complete work cycles are covered.
      9.2.4. Identify all frequencies and PATs that can be obtained by using techniques other than technical
      estimates.
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                           179


   9.2.5. Identify activities that directly relate to other activities. For example, if activity b is always
   done as a follow-on to activity a, their frequencies should relate.
   9.2.6. Identify activities that indirectly relate to other activities. For example, in a maintenance work
   center, “part replaced” might relate to “part transaction” processed in a supply work center.
   9.2.7. Find the number and skill of people assigned to the work center in the past 12 months. If 12
   months of data is not available, the study team sets minimum data needs.
   9.2.8. Find out whether man-hours were borrowed, loaned, or spent in overtime.
   9.2.9. Make sure measured man-hours show required work. Historical workload data and associated
   man-hours may not show the real work center needs. Overmanning or undermanning affects the level
   of effort and the historical workload production level. Contracted work, backlog, labor negotiations,
   or future production schedules might also be a factor. Identify and document the impact of these con-
   ditions during measurement.

9.3. Frequency (fi) Determination.
   9.3.1. Establish Frequencies. Establish activity frequencies using historical records, directed require-
   ment, or technical estimate. Each technique is discussed below.
   9.3.2. Historical Record.
      9.3.2.1. Research historical records such as reports, letters, messages, rosters, etc. Verify data with
      work center people.
      9.3.2.2. In some cases, it is possible to relate unknown frequencies to reliable recorded data to
      find more objective estimates. For example, if there is no record in a work center to show the fre-
      quency that a particular part is replaced, a check of supply issue records may verify the frequency.
      9.3.2.3. Counts of potential WLFs often equate to activity frequencies that can be used to support
      or verify frequencies through an indirect relationship. Evaluate work counts and workload cycles
      associated with specific processes to determine the natural frequency period (for example, daily,
      weekly, monthly, quarterly or yearly), as well as frequency counts.
   9.3.3. Directed Requirement.
      9.3.3.1. Use frequencies that are predetermined by directive or policy (for example, inspections).
      9.3.3.2. The study team documents directed frequencies in the measurement plan. If frequencies
      are not documented, the input team immediately identifies the source of the requirement to the
      study team for potential use at other input measurement sites.
   9.3.4. Technical Estimate.
      9.3.4.1. Use technical estimates for activity frequency only when no alternative data source is
      available.
      9.3.4.2. Exclude extreme estimates when determining average frequency if they are not represen-
      tative (for example, based on lack of experience or isolated situations). Before discarding a fre-
      quency as an extreme value, verify its occurrence by cross-referencing it with other relatable step
      frequencies. Do not arbitrarily exclude extreme frequencies without justification.

         9.3.4.3. Base estimates on judgment and experience. Get a more confident estimate by sampling
         the judgment and experience of several people in the work center. Where two similar work centers
         exist at the same base in separate organizations, get estimates from both of them.
         9.3.4.4. Use benchmark or expected frequency values included in the measurement plan as a
         guide for evaluating work center estimates. Expect reasonable variations; however, large varia-
         tions produced by differences in conditions or levels of service need investigating.

9.4. Per Accomplishment Time (ti) Determination.
      9.4.1. Determine Activity Man-hours. Determine required activity man-hours using directed require-
      ments, good operator, historical records, or technical estimates as follows:
      9.4.2. Directed Requirement.
         9.4.2.1. Use per accomplishment times that are predetermined by directive, policy, or other per-
         formance standards (for example, contract statement of work).
         9.4.2.2. The study team documents directed times in the measurement plan. If this has not been
         done, the input team immediately notifies the study team and identifies the source for potential use
         at other measurement sites.
      9.4.3. Good Operator Timing.
         9.4.3.1. Consult with work center supervisor to jointly select a qualified person who does the pro-
         cess at an average pace. (If possible, select more than one good operator.) Selecting an average
         individual negates the need for pace rating.
         9.4.3.2. The study team decides on the number of observations needed.
         9.4.3.3. Observe good operator and record time.
         9.4.3.4. Apply the personal, rest, and delay (PR&D) allowance factor.
      9.4.4. Historical Record.
         9.4.4.1. Use recorded historical per accomplishment times only if the method of recording and
         reporting has been thoroughly checked and validated.
         9.4.4.2. Validate a reporting system by examining several recorded times for the same activity and
         sampling the accuracy of reported data compared to measured times.
         9.4.4.3. Make sure that the time recorded for work corresponds exactly to the associated activity
         in the POD.
         9.4.4.4. Use the average historical time based on all representative values.
         9.4.4.5. It is not necessary to apply the PR&D allowance factor to PATs determined by this tech-
         nique. These PATs are averages derived from estimates; not based on timing of the event. Due to
         the lack of precision associated with estimating, it is assumed the estimated average PAT includes
         enough time for these allowances.
      9.4.5. Technical Estimate.
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                          181


       9.4.5.1. Base time estimates on the judgment and experience of a representative number of work
       center personnel. Sample three or four people where possible. The more samples used to deter-
       mine average time, the more credence given to the estimate.
       9.4.5.2. When the PAT is affected by varying levels of complexity, derive a weighted average PAT
       (per estimator) based on percent of occurrence. For example:


                      Percent of Occurrence
       Complexity        (must total 100%)            PAT


       Difficult               20%                    .75
       Normal                  70%                  .50
       Easy                    10%                 .20


Weighted PAT = (.20)(.75) + (.70)(.50) + (.10)(.20)
        = .15 + .35 + .02
        = .52


Give estimates in regard to:


           9.4.5.2.1. The first estimate, the difficult time, is an estimate of the longest time the step
           would take under the most adverse conditions (if things go wrong).
           9.4.5.2.2. The second estimate, the normal time, is the most realistic estimate of the time it
           will take to do the step. In most cases, this percentage of occurrence will be higher than either
           of the other two estimates (difficult & easy) as it represents what normally happens.
           9.4.5.2.3. The third estimate, the easy time, is the shortest time that the step can be performed
           if everything goes well.
           9.4.5.2.4. After establishing the average unit time per step (per estimator), sum these averages
           (see Figure 9.1.) to attain the PAT per step for each process of the work center.

9.5. Data Examination.
      9.5.1. When measurement has been completed, check frequencies and times with work center person-
      nel.
         9.5.1.1. Begin by checking measured activities and historical workload.
             9.5.1.1.1. Compare process frequencies with WLF counts.
             9.5.1.1.2. Compare frequencies of related steps. For example, the number of unit production
             reports completed for each unit produced should relate to the number of units produced.
             9.5.1.1.3. When frequencies are generated by input from another work center or by products
             sent to another work center, check with the other work center. Frequency counts from the
             receiving work center should match records of the sending work center.
             9.5.1.1.4. Compare PATs for similar steps. For example, time differences between preparing a
             type A report and a type B report should be justified by the characteristics of the reports. If not,
             question the measured times.
         9.5.1.2. Check all measurement data. Each process consists of a certain number of steps. Figure
         9.1. shows four estimates of the time needed to do each step. Estimates will vary for one reason or
         another. Therefore, use the average or mean estimate as an expression of the time it takes to do a
         step. The average will likely be a more accurate estimate than any one of the four individual esti-
         mates. When an estimate for a particular step is unlike the other three estimates (Figure 9.1., step
         1, estimator 4), the measuring craftsman consults with the estimator and revises or discards it. The
         craftsman then calculates a new monthly average time for the step and records it on the AF Form
         1040. Once all of the steps in a process are analyzed in the above manner, add their averages
         together to get the average productive time for each process.
      9.5.2. Make sure that man-hours show all true requirements, not what was performed or what person-
      nel would like to do in excess of valid requirements. Historical data includes any mistakes or ineffi-
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                     183


   ciencies of past operations. Past performance does not mean that the manpower was used to the best
   advantage or future work should be done under the same condition.
   9.5.3. Remember that each input will be analyzed by the study team and compared with all other input
   measurements. Furnish supplemental forms and comments to aid the study team. If measurement data
   appears inconsistent but has been verified based on specific characteristics of the work, relay this
   information to the study team. If derived weighted averages were used, send the calculations to the
   study team. The overall quality of the study depends on the input team's measurement.
   9.5.4. Get the work center supervisor's concurrence or a specific, documented reason for nonconcur-
   rence.
   9.5.5. When SIAMs are used, brief the work center supervisor on the use of SIAMs to credit indirect
   man-hours. Chapter 13 gives details.

9.6. Data Reporting.

 Box   Enter (See note).
  1    Appropriate title and functional account code for work center measured.
  2    Appropriate command and installation used as the source for measurement data.
  3    Date work measurement was completed.
  4    Nothing. These codes are used as entries in box 5c for data system use. Frequency codes convert alpha numeric
       codes to data used for man-hour computation as described in Table 9.2.
 5A    Process and step titles as shown in the process oriented description. The words "DIRECT" and "INDIRECT"
       must precede the appropriate process groupings. Use the same numeric identifiers and avoid unclear
       abbreviations.
 5B    Whole number occurrence per time period that expresses the actual task frequency (e.g., 1/D1 for one per day
       for a five workday week). Activities that occur less than one time per year may be reflected as fractional
       frequencies (e.g., an activity occurring once every two years is shown as .5/YR). Reflect the expected natural
       rate of occurrence. For example, a quarterly report is shown as 1/QT, but an activity that occurs at four random
       times throughout the year is shown as 4/YR. Use frequency symbol from Table 9.2. Fractional frequencies
       may be used, if derived from historical records.
 5C    Frequency code number from box 4 that corresponds with each activity. For example: For an activity
       frequency based on a 5-day workweek, enter "1."
 5D    Applicable conversion factor from Table 9.2.
 5E    Allowed time required to complete one occurrence of the activity. Express time in clock minutes. If time does
       not include allowances (good operator time), multiply by the appropriate allowance factor and enter the result.
       Entry includes time for all personnel required to accomplish the activity (if a two-man team requires an elapsed
       time of 1.00 hour, the correct entry is 120 minutes).
 5F    Product of frequency times conversion times per accomplishment time (box 5B)x(box 5D)x(box 5E) divided
       by 60. This value depicts the allowed man-hours per month required by the work center to perform the activity.
       Man-hours are entered with two decimal places.
 5G    Process man-hour totals. Enter the total monthly allowed man-hours summed for a specific process, on the line
       below the last activity in the process. Total man-hours are entered with two decimal places. Direct and Indirect
       Man-hour Totals. Enter immediately under the last applicable process total. Total man-hours entered to two
       decimal places. If additive man-hours are measured, two totals are entered: enter the standard total and
       immediately below it, enter the total for the additive. Total man-hours are entered to two decimal places.
 5H    Letter code to show how data was obtained for the activity frequency (first code) and per accomplishment time
       (second code). The following are the appropriate codes:
        For activity frequency:
        T - data based on technical estimate (i.e., local records or personal interview)
        H - data based on historical records                       D - based on directed requirement

                          FUNCTIONAL MEASURES DEVELOPMENT

10.1. Introduction to Functional Measures Development. All need to know how well they are doing
their job. An improvement system that helps assess information important for the user is the best answer.
   10.1.1. AFI 90-1102, Performance Management, specifically outlines the Air Force’s construct for a
   continual performance improvement process that focuses on the accomplishment of mission essential
   tasks. Components of the Air Force Performance Management process covered in AFI 90-1102 are
   goals, mission essential tasks (METs), performance measures, standards and targets, and task assur-
   ance. Although this chapter will not cover any aspect of the system outlined in AFI 90-1102, the Per-
   formance Management construct of “Plan, Do, Assess” applies to functional measures as well as any
   other improvement system.
   10.1.2. This chapter covers the information any user needs to know to track functional measures. The
   functional measures development process provides a useful feedback system for all people, especially
   at the lowest work center level. Work center personnel develop the assessment process themselves and
   generally use it to continually improve functional measures. The following critical elements are
   required when developing functional measures:
       10.1.2.1. Top level management supports the assessment process.
       10.1.2.2. Management identifies an individual who becomes familiar with the functional mea-
       sures development procedures, outlined in this chapter. This individual will lead work center per-
       sonnel through the functional measures development.

10.2. Elements of the Functional Measures Tracking System (FMTS). These indicators are needed to
track performance in FMTS:
   10.2.1. Input - available monthly man-hours.
   10.2.2. Output - total output production or services completed each month.
   10.2.3. Efficiency - output divided by input.
   10.2.4. Unit man-hour cost - input divided by output.
   10.2.5. Effectiveness indicators furnish feedback information on the quality and timeliness of a work
   center's performance. Personnel should identify at least one effectiveness indicator for their work cen-
   ter.

10.3. Systems Analysis.
   10.3.1. Factors influencing a work center are easy to understand if the work center is viewed as a sys-
   tem and analyzed as such. Figure 10.1. shows a system view of any work center or functional activity.
188                                                             AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


Figure 10.1. Generalized Systems Diagram.




      10.3.2. The box in the center of the page represents the work center. This area includes the inputs and
      processes that produce the products or services that become outputs. The value-adding activities are
      the processes the work center personnel use to transform the inputs into outputs.
      10.3.3. Each work center has customers for the products or services that become outputs.
         10.3.3.1. These customers may be internal to the organization that includes the work center. Inter-
         nal customers receive data or use the work center's output as an input for their value-adding activ-
         ities.
         10.3.3.2. The customers may be external to the work center's organization.
      10.3.4. Suppliers supply products or services to the work center. In this case, the work center is a cus-
      tomer of those suppliers.
      10.3.5. Customers have needs and expectations for the outputs of their suppliers. Customers decide
      on the quality of the output of their suppliers by how well the product or service satisfies their needs
      and expectations. The work center in this system acts both as a customer and supplier. This work cen-
      ter must satisfy its customers’ expectations and needs, just as it expects its suppliers to do the same.
      10.3.6. Customer needs will determine management's policy on the quality and timeliness for the
      work center's output.
      10.3.7. The work center personnel must have a means of determining how well they are meeting the
      needs and expectations of their customers. They must also know how effectively their suppliers are
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                          189


   meeting their expectations. This can be done by identifying pertinent effectiveness indicators. Indica-
   tors can also be identified to monitor the work center's inputs, processes or value-adding activities,
   and outputs.

10.4. Components of the Feedback System.
   10.4.1. Key Result Areas (KRA). These are the most critical selected areas of a function's responsi-
   bilities that, when monitored, state how well the work center is performing its mission requirements.
      10.4.1.1. A work center's mission statement identifies its responsibilities in the organization. It
      also identifies what the work center has to do to support the organization's mission. Work center
      personnel break their mission statement down into measurable components or KRAs.
      10.4.1.2. Select only the number of KRAs that give an adequate overview of the work center's
      performance. It's not necessary to monitor every process in a work center to know how well its
      mission is being done.
   10.4.2. Functional Measures Indicators. These indicators show a work center's performance in terms
   of both efficiency and effectiveness. They serve to compare and evaluate effectiveness against estab-
   lished performance levels or goals. A good measurement system:
      10.4.2.1. Monitors KRAs of the work center's mission. Choose indicators that monitor the most
      important needs of the work center's mission. Just one indicator may not give a true picture of a
      work center's overall performance. Therefore, select the minimum number of indicators that satis-
      factorily furnish a useful reflection of the work center's efforts.
      10.4.2.2. Is easily understood by all function personnel. All indicators should be logical and
      meaningful to work center personnel.
      10.4.2.3. Can be controlled by the work center's actions. That is, actions taken by work center per-
      sonnel should be shown by a change in input, output, efficiency, effectiveness, or unit man-hour
      cost indicators. This does not mean that work center personnel should be able to make the indica-
      tors say what they want them to say. But the indicators should show when a measurable change
      has taken place in a work center. Significant changes (positive or negative) should cause the super-
      visor to ask "why." Corrective action may be necessary depending on the causes identified as a
      result of a review. These readings are primarily a feedback tool so the supervisor and his people
      can assess the work center's performance for a given period of time. Work center personnel can
      then evaluate policies and procedures, job assignments, and worker performance.
      10.4.2.4. Includes indicators that show efficiency and effectiveness. Functional measures indica-
      tors should track how efficiently a work center is operating and how effectively it is meeting its
      mission requirements.
      10.4.2.5. Can evaluate change. Effectiveness indicators should help management evaluate goals
      or standards. If an indicator does not show any noticeable change, it may no longer be useful.
      Also, if an indicator that has been monitored (over a period of time) levels off at an acceptable
      level to management and appears to have stabilized, work center personnel can select another
      more critical indicator in its place.
      10.4.2.6. Includes indicators that are useful and cost efficient. Indicators should track the major or
      most representative needs of the work center. However, do not choose an indicator whose cost, in
      time and effort to get data, is greater than its value for showing the work center's performance.
190                                                            AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


         When possible, use existing reporting systems to extract needed data. If reporting systems are not
         available, work center personnel should develop interim procedures to aid future collection of the
         needed data.
      10.4.3. Mission Effectiveness Charts. Mission effectiveness charts offer a means of developing a
      potentially nonlinear association between levels of performance shown by an effectiveness indicator
      with effectiveness points. Work center personnel first identify effectiveness indicators and then asso-
      ciate point values for different levels of performance shown by the indicators. One mission effective-
      ness chart is developed for each effectiveness indicator.

10.5. The Workshop Facilitation Process. The work center should be viewed as part of a system to
show the interactions of the work center with its customers and suppliers. The systems view of the work
center assures that all needed elements for performance feedback are covered. The information necessary
for the performance feedback system should be developed in a workshop environment. All necessary
information can be obtained in the workshop used for an Air Force Process Oriented Review. If functional
measures are not developed as part of a Process Oriented Review, two different workshops should be
held.
      10.5.1. The first workshop consists of upper-level management and immediate subordinates. For
      example, in a Base Supply organization the workshop members would be composed of the com-
      mander, his branch chiefs, and the workshop facilitator. This group identifies customers and checks
      current mission statements to identify KRAs for the subordinate work centers.
      10.5.2. The second workshop consists of the branch chiefs from the first workshop, his or her work
      center supervisors, and key workers. This group reviews the product of the first workshop and modi-
      fies it, if necessary. This group then develops functional measures indicators and associated mission
      effectiveness charts for their work centers.

10.6. The Nominal Group Technique. The facilitator works with the work center representatives and
management, in a workshop environment, to identify work center customers, KRAs, efficiency and effec-
tiveness indicators, and mission effectiveness charts. These elements can be identified using a proven
approach called the Nominal Group Technique. This technique is a useful problem-solving and idea-gen-
erating strategy. The process begins with the workshop facilitator discussing each step of the process to
the workshop participants. The nominal group technique is controlled by the facilitator and includes these
steps: silent generation, round robin listing, clarification, and voting and ranking. These steps are
described below for identifying the KRAs. These same steps may be used to identify work center custom-
ers and functional measures indicators.
      10.6.1. Silent Generation.
         10.6.1.1. The silent generation step typically takes about 10 minutes. During this step, the facili-
         tator writes a carefully worded task statement:
         WHAT IS THE PRIMARY SERVICE OR PRODUCT OF THIS WORK CENTER?
         Each participant responds to this task statement during the structured group session. It is perhaps
         the most critical element of the nominal group technique. The task statement is simple, direct, and
         addresses the subject being pursued. Tell workshop participants to write their responses to the task
         statement on a sheet of paper. Good opening task statements when developing effectiveness indi-
         cators are: Our task is to develop an indicator that will allow us to decide if the work center is
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                          191


     achieving the performance level desired, to determine what quantitative indicators the work center
     personnel should track on a monthly basis, and to tell if the work center's mission is being effec-
     tively accomplished.
     10.6.1.2. If the facilitator is asked what is meant by the task statement, it is best to avoid introduc-
     ing bias by giving examples. Instead, the facilitator might ask several of the participants to give
     their interpretation of the task statement. If the responses appear to meet the objective and the
     remainder of the participants grasp the task, it is all right to proceed.
     10.6.1.3. Even if most participants appear to stop writing before 10 minutes are up, do not shorten
     the period. If some talking occurs, the facilitator should tactfully ask for cooperation in letting oth-
     ers think through and record their ideas.
     10.6.1.4. Like each of the steps in the nominal group technique, silence is an important element.
     Research has shown that for generating ideas, individuals are more effective than groups. Silent
     generation focuses attention on a specific task, frees participants from distractions, and gives them
     an opportunity to think through their ideas rather than to simply react, thus yielding inputs of
     greater quality and variety. Participants are motivated by the tension of seeing those around them
     working hard at the group task. They are forced to pay attention to the task longer, rather than con-
     sidering the first input suggested to the group. They are freed from all of the inhibiting effects of
     the usual face-to-face interaction of unstructured groups.
     10.6.1.5. When the 10 minutes are up, the facilitator interrupts the silent generation process.
     (NOTE: Additional ideas may also be produced for use following silent generation.)
  10.6.2. Round Robin Listing.
     10.6.2.1. The facilitator calls on participants, in turn, to read one of their written responses. Par-
     ticipants may pass at any time and may also join in on any later round. A participant may propose
     only one item at a time, and either the facilitator or an assistant records each item as it is offered.
     The only discussion allowed is between the facilitator and the participant who proposed the item.
     The discussion is limited to seeking a concise rephrasing for recording. As each participant
     responds, the facilitator repeats exactly what has been said, and the assistant records the concise
     phrase on a sheet. The facilitator may help rephrasing to maintain consistency and achieve session
     goals as long as the basic idea or concept is not altered. This phase goes on until all the ideas pro-
     duced by the group are listed and displayed. Judgment of ideas should not take place during this
     early and crucial portion of the group process.
     10.6.2.2. This round robin listing step allows the leader to establish an atmosphere of acceptance
     and trust. He or she does not unduly rephrase or evaluate the contributions. All responses are
     equally and prominently displayed before the group. Leader openness and nonevaluative behavior
     are essential here. Make sure each idea and each participant receives equal attention and accep-
     tance. The process separates ideas from their authors and lets conflicting and incompatible ideas
     be considered. This step furnishes a written record of the group’s efforts and makes later docu-
     mentation easier.
  10.6.3. Clarification of Responses.
     10.6.3.1. Once all the items have been recorded, the facilitator calls on the author of each item to
     offer clarification if needed. This is done so that the other participants understand the item as it has
     been recorded. During this step, the logic behind items is brought out. Differences of opinion may
192                                                               AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


         be expressed, but only the author of an item can decide if it can be eliminated or joined with
         another item because it duplicates others.
         10.6.3.2. The facilitator keeps the group moving rapidly through the list of items. While the group
         members are clarifying their ideas with the facilitator, he should control lengthy discussions, argu-
         ments, and speech making. Again, the effort is to separate ideas from their authors, to clarify
         rather than to evaluate, and to ensure full opportunities for participation.
         10.6.3.3. The clarification aspect of the nominal group technique has the most impact on the qual-
         ity of the resulting list of items. If there is a great deal of overlap from item to item and if the group
         members don't understand what each item means, the next step, voting and ranking, will be
         invalid. Experience has shown that a certain amount of idea combination is necessary. Careful
         combining or subtle clarifying during the round robin step helps alleviate clarification difficulties.
      10.6.4. Voting and Ranking.
         10.6.4.1. This final step gives participants an opportunity to select the most important items and
         rank them. The items should be visible to all workshop members, either on a chalkboard or large
         pad of paper. Give the participants blank "3 x 5" cards. The number can vary. If five cards are
         used, ask each participant to select the five most important items from the list in front of them. A
         typical list may have 15 to 20 items. To avoid any confusion, ask participants to write the items out
         in the center of the blank card. Also ask them to write the item numbers in the upper left-hand cor-
         ner. After this is done, have them spread the five cards out in front of them and follow the next
         steps that are designed to rank and weigh the items.
             10.6.4.1.1. Tell the participants to choose the most important item from the five cards, write
             the number 5 with a circle around it in the lower right-hand corner of the card, and set the card
             aside. Another way of phrasing this is “Which of the five items would you select if you could
             only use one?”
             10.6.4.1.2. Then say, "From the remaining four cards, choose the least important item, write
             the number 1 with a circle around it in the lower right-hand corner of the card, and set the card
             aside." Another way of phrasing this is "If you could only use three of the four items in front
             of you, which one item would you throw away?"
             10.6.4.1.3. Then state, "From the remaining three cards, choose the most important item, write
             the number 4 with a circle around it in the lower right-hand corner to the card, and set the card
             aside."
             10.6.4.1.4. Finally, have the participants choose the least important of the remaining two cards
             and have them write the number 2 with a circle around it in the lower right-hand corner of the
             card. The remaining card will be numbered with a circled 3.
         10.6.4.2. Tabulate the Results. Sort the cards by item number from the original list and record the
         weights given to each. Display individual weights to show the number of weights given and their
         variation. This step allows the functional representatives to present their evaluations free of peer
         pressure. For an example of results, see Figure 10.2.. Select no more than the top five KRAs iden-
         tified by the tabulation results. These KRAs are then checked for possible effectiveness indicators.
         Remember, if this is a process-oriented review workshop, the participants will identify and
         develop the effectiveness indicators. If the feedback system is being developed separately, the sec-

       ond group identified in paragraph 10.5.2. will identify and develop the effectiveness indicators for
       their work centers.

10.7. Developing a Functional Measures Indicator.
   10.7.1. After the workshop participants agree on the KRAs that should be monitored, they decide the
   best functional measures indicators for each area.
   10.7.2. Use care when developing indicators to distinguish between those that address efficiency
   (output or input) and those that show effectiveness (quality, timeliness, etc.).
194                                                          AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


      10.7.2.1. Efficiency is defined as the ratio of outputs produced to inputs consumed. Input can be
      unit man-hours, capital, or material. We'll limit our input to available man-hours. For example:
      Base Supply Parts Issue Section issued 21,000 items during January, using 840 man-hours.


      Output = 21,000 Items = 25 Items Issued Per Man-hour
      Input    840 Man-hours


      The result (25) represents the efficiency factor for January. Taken by itself, the number is of little
      use. But, by comparing it to another time period like the previous month (December) for a base-
      line yield of 16,000 items in 800 hours or 20 items per hour, January's man-hour efficiency was 25
      percent higher (25/20) than the previous month.


      10.7.2.2. Another way of treating the output-input relationship is to divide the man-hours used by
      the output produced to derive unit cost.


       Dec Input = 800 = .050 Man-hours/item issued
         Output 16,000


       Jan Input = 840 = .040 Man-hours/item issued
         Output 21,000


      10.7.2.3. Effectiveness indicators measure goal attainment, timeliness, quality, etc., and their
      impact on customers of other functions and organizations. Effectiveness is defined as the ratio of
      successful events or accomplishments to total accomplishments, a predetermined goal, standard,
      or baseline. Some examples are:
         10.7.2.3.1. Quality. A functional OPR's goal is to maintain a first-time, right-part issue rate of
         no less than 99.5%. During January, 75 items were returned due to Issue Section errors. The
         resulting 99.6% rate, therefore, was still acceptable.


          Quality = (21,000 - 75)/21,000(100) = 99.6%


         10.7.2.3.2. Timeliness. Another possible goal of work center personnel is to reduce walk-in
         customer waiting time from its FY 99 average of 15 minutes to 10 minutes or less. By putting
         some of the high-use items closer to the counter, leasing computerized optical scan equipment,
         and asking the customers to complete certain portions of the request document before reaching
         the counter, the average waiting time dropped to just 5 minutes per customer in this example.
      10.7.2.4. Other indicators include, but are not limited to: readiness, reliability, accuracy, safety,
      security, maintainability, survivability, mobility, sustainability, and flexibility.
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                           195


10.8. Mission Effectiveness Charts. Mission effectiveness charts allow work center personnel to trans-
form the values earned by effectiveness indicators into effectiveness points. This transformation sets the
work center's policy on how important different values earned by an effectiveness indicator is to the work
center personnel. The transformation also weighs the importance of different effectiveness indicators.
   10.8.1. Developing Mission Effectiveness Charts.
       10.8.1.1. Developing mission effectiveness charts, like developing KRAs and indicators, needs
       consensus among members of the workshop. These charts are developed in the Process Oriented
       Review workshop. If the feedback system is not developed as part of a process-oriented review,
       these charts are developed in the second workshop discussed in paragraph 10.5.. See Figure 10.3.
       for a blank Mission Effectiveness Chart. To facilitate developing the mission effectiveness chart,
       certain information for each effectiveness indicator is needed when it is first identified and
       defined. This adds a refinement step to the indicator development process discussed previously. It
       is better to refine indicators at this first stage of developing indicators rather than later, because
       workshop members have recently completed identifying and defining indicators and will have a
       clear understanding of their meaning. If this refinement is deferred, some members of the work-
       shop may forget important details about the indicators.

Figure 10.3. General Form of the Mission Effectiveness Chart.




       10.8.1.2. The facilitator should lead the workshop members to a consensus on the answers to three
       questions for each indicator. The first two questions to be used to refine each indicator are as fol-
       lows:
       IF EVERYTHING GOES RIGHT FOR YOUR ORGANIZATION OR WORK CENTER, WHAT
       IS THE "FEASIBLE BEST" YOU COULD DO ON THIS INDICATOR?
196                                                       AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


      IF EVERYTHING GOES WRONG FOR YOUR ORGANIZATION OR WORK CENTER,
      WHAT IS THE "FEASIBLE WORST" YOU COULD DO ON THIS INDICATOR?
      This pair of values constitutes the best and worst performance possible, considering real-world
      organizational constraints and environmental peculiarities (see Figure 10.4.).

Figure 10.4. Feasible Best and Worst Locations on the Mission Effectiveness Chart.




      10.8.1.3. The facilitator should make sure that workshop members understand that "feasible" best
      and worst are not the same as "absolute" best and worst. For instance, consider this indicator for
      customer satisfaction: number of customer inquiries satisfied/number of customer inquiries
      received (monthly) x 100. The absolute or arithmetic best would be 100%, meaning that all inquir-
      ies received are satisfied. This may, however, not be the feasible best if workshop members
      believe that they regularly receive a few inquiries that can't be satisfied regardless of how hard
      they try. The feasible best may, thus, be only 95% or even 90%.
          The third question to ask is:
      BETWEEN THE FEASIBLE BEST AND FEASIBLE WORST, WHAT IS THE LEVEL, POINT,
      OR ZONE OF PERFORMANCE ON THIS INDICATOR THAT IS NOT GOOD OR NOT BAD,
      THAT IS THE "BREAK-EVEN" OR "DON'T ROCK THE BOAT" POINT?
      The facilitator should tell the workshop members that this is also the safety, expected, or normal
      performance point. That is, this is the point where the work center supervisor will neither become
      concerned that performance is too low and commit more resources, nor feel that performance is so
      good that the work center should be recognized for outstanding effort.
      10.8.1.4. For instance, in terms of the customer satisfaction indicator example above, members
      may feel that satisfying 8 of 10 customer inquiries (80%) would be neither bad nor good. That is,
      the group may believe that the supervisor will become concerned if performance falls below 80%,
      but that if performance rises above 80%, the supervisor will begin to recognize that the work cen-
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                         197


     ter is doing a good job. On the other hand, the group may believe that there is no single normal
     performance point, but instead, there is a range of expected performance represented by a zone of,
     say, from 75% to 85%. In other words, they believe that the supervisor is not concerned in a zone
     of 75% to 85% but will become concerned if the percentage falls below 75% or be impressed if the
     percentage rises above 85%.
  10.8.2. Weighting Indicators.
     10.8.2.1. The next step is for the facilitator to point out to workshop members the likelihood that
     their indicators are not of equal importance. The facilitator should use several simple examples to
     bring out this point. For instance, in assessing the overall performance of a baseball team, which
     of these indicators would be of greater interest to the team manager: number of home runs hit or
     number of bats broken? In a military communications/navigation equipment repair shop, would
     the supervisor be more interested in "radios and radars returned from the flight line for failure to
     work properly (bounce rate)" or "number of dental checkup appointments missed by personnel?"
     In answering this second question, remember that although missing dental appointments is seri-
     ous, the bounce rate directly affects flying capability and is, therefore, of critical interest to the
     wing commander, whose success depends in large part on getting aircraft into the air. (NOTE: The
     answers are, of course, that the baseball manager is more interested in home runs and the supervi-
     sor is more concerned about the bounce rate.) Getting workshop members to achieve consensus on
     the relative importance of their indicators is the next step in developing mission effectiveness
     charts. Use an Indicator Weighting Table to identify the relative importance of indicators. (See
     Figure 10.5.).
198                                                                 AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003

EP = Effectiveness Points

        10.8.2.2. On the left-hand side of the Indicator Weighting Table, the facilitator writes the KRA
        and indicators that were developed for the work center under study. The KRAs and the indicators
        that measure KRA accomplishment form the rows of the table. At the top of the table, the facilita-
        tor enters the column headings shown in Figure 10.5.. For the first and fourth columns, the facili-
        tator writes, for each indicator, the feasible best and feasible worst values derived earlier in the
        process of refining indicators. The facilitator should remind workshop members that these feasible
        best and worst values are their own judgments and are different from the absolute (arithmetic) best
        and worst.
        10.8.2.3. In the example shown in Figure 10.5., there are three KRAs and five indicators. For
        each indicator there is a corresponding set of feasible best and worst values shown in columns (1)
        and (4). For Indicator #1, workshop members said in the indicator refinement stage that the feasi-
        ble best the work center could do in satisfying inquiries was 95%; they believed that some pecu-
        liarity would always prevent their achieving 100%. They said the feasible worst was 50%. On
        Indicator #2, the feasible best and worst in terms of number of complaints received were zero and
        five, respectively; and so on for the feasible best and worst for the other three indicators.
        10.8.2.4. Once the facilitator has entered all feasible best and worst values in columns (1) and (4),
        the next step is to complete column (2) of the Indicator Weighting Table. Column 2 is used to
        record the consensus judgment of the workshop members as to the relative importance or rank of
        each feasible best value of the indicators. To identify ranks of the feasible best values for column
        (2), the facilitator says:
        SUPPOSE EVERYTHING IMAGINABLE GOES RIGHT FOR THE WORK CENTER FOR A
        GIVEN MEASUREMENT PERIOD. YOU ARE STAFFED AT 100 PERCENT. LITTLE SICK
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                         199


     OR ANNUAL LEAVE IS TAKEN. THERE ARE NO READINESS EXERCISES. OTHER
     ORGANIZATIONS YOU WORK WITH ARE COOPERATIVE. BECAUSE OF THESE AND
     OTHER POSITIVE INFLUENCES, THE WORK CENTER PERFORMS AT ITS FEASIBLE
     BEST ON ALL INDICATORS. THE WORK CENTER PERFORMS AT 95% ON CUSTOMER
     INQUIRIES SATISFIED, 0 ON CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS, AND SO ON. IF THIS WERE
     TRUE, WHICH OF THE FIVE FEASIBLE BESTS WOULD HAVE THE GREATEST POSI-
     TIVE EFFECT ON THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE (MISSION) OF THE WORK CENTER?
     Workshop members then discuss alternative answers to this question until the members reach con-
     sensus on which indicator is the most important when all show the feasible best value. This indi-
     cator is ranked one and a "1" is entered in column (2) for that indicator. (In the Figure 10.5.
     example, the most important feasible best was that for Indicator #4.) In case of ties between two or
     more indicators, each of the tied indicators will be assigned the same rank. For instance, if two
     indicators will equally result in the greatest positive impact, both should receive the rank of one.
     The facilitator continues:
     NOW THAT YOU HAVE IDENTIFIED THE INDICATOR WHOSE FEASIBLE BEST VALUE
     HAS THE GREATEST POSITIVE IMPACT, WHICH OF THE REMAINING INDICATORS’
     FEASIBLE BEST HAS THE SECOND GREATEST POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE OVERALL
     PERFORMANCE OF THE WORK CENTER?
     This indicator is ranked two and a "2" is marked in the proper row of column (2). (In Figure
     10.5.Indicator #5 is ranked 2). The process continues with workshop members ranking the impor-
     tance of the feasible best on the remaining indicators.
     10.8.2.5. After the feasible bests have been ranked in column (2), the facilitator asks workshop
     members to change these ranks to effectiveness points for column (3), and says:
     IF WE AUTOMATICALLY ASSIGN 100 EFFECTIVENESS POINTS TO THE FEASIBLE
     BEST FOR THE INDICATOR YOU RANKED FIRST, AS HAVING THE GREATEST POSI-
     TIVE MISSION IMPACT, HOW MUCH LESS IS THE IMPACT ON THE OVERALL MIS-
     SION OF THE INDICATOR WHOSE FEASIBLE BEST YOU RANKED SECOND?
     The facilitator then explains that if the indicator ranked second were only about half as important
     to the mission as the indicator ranked first, it would be assigned 50 effectiveness points. If it were
     considered three-fourths as important, it would receive 75 points. If its impact was almost as
     important as that of the indicator ranked first, an effectiveness rating of 95 or 98 points might be
     assigned. This process continues until all indicator ranks in column (2) have been transformed to
     effectiveness points and recorded in column (3).
     10.8.2.6. For the indicators shown in Figure 10.5., Indicator #4 (with the rank of one) automati-
     cally received 100 effectiveness points. Indicator #5 (with the rank of two) was judged to have
     90% as positive an impact on the work center's effectiveness as Indicator #4 and was thus assigned
     90 effectiveness points. Finally, Indicators #1, #2, and #3 were tied in column (2) at the rank of
     three, and workshop members agree that these indicators should receive 75 effectiveness points
     each.
     10.8.2.7. A similar process is then performed to find the ranks (column 5) and effectiveness points
     (column 6) of the feasible worst values of the indicators. The facilitator begins this process of
     ranking with workshop members as follows:
200                                                            AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


         SUPPOSE EVERYTHING GOES WRONG FOR THE WORK CENTER FOR A GIVEN MEA-
         SUREMENT PERIOD. YOUR MANNING LEVEL IS VERY LOW. THERE IS A BIG SNOW-
         STORM. THERE IS AN UNEXPECTED READINESS EXERCISE. THE MOON IS FULL.
         MORALE IS LOW AND THE WORK CENTER WORKS AT ITS FEASIBLE WORST ON
         ALL 5 INDICATORS. IF THIS WERE TRUE, WHICH OF THE INDICATORS WOULD HAVE
         THE GREATEST NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE (MISSION) OF
         THE WORK CENTER? WHICH LOW SCORE WOULD HURT YOU THE MOST?
         The feasible worst values are ranked in column (5) with "1" for the indicator with the greatest neg-
         ative impact; again, ties are possible. As shown in column (5) of Figure 10.5., the workshop mem-
         bers judged that Indicator #4 would have the greatest negative impact; Indicator #5, the second
         greatest negative impact; Indicator #3, the third; Indicator #2, the fourth; and Indicator #1, the
         fifth.
         10.8.2.8. The next step is to transform the ranks in column (5) to negative effectiveness points in
         column (6). Though the feasible worst will usually receive -100 effectiveness points, the auto-
         matic assignment of -100 is not absolutely necessary. For instance, in the case of Indicator #4 in
         Figure 10.5. (which was ranked one for having the greatest negative impact on the work center),
         workshop members believe that this indicator was simply not as bad as -100. They saw a differ-
         ence in the impact on the work center's effectiveness (mission) between the feasible best and worst
         on this indicator. They believed that -90 was the impact of the feasible worst; therefore, -90 was
         recorded in column (6) for Indicator #4.
         10.8.2.9. Once the negative effectiveness point rating is decided for the indicator ranked number
         one, the process continues, with members coming to consensus regarding the ratings for the
         remaining indicators. In the Figure 10.5. example, workshop members decide that the next feasi-
         ble worst indicator (#5) should receive -80 effectiveness points and that the other three indicators
         (#3, #2, and #1) should be assigned effectiveness points of -75, -70, and -50, respectively.
         10.8.2.10. Note that the effectiveness points for the feasible best values are always positive (e.g.,
         100, 90, and 75), and the effectiveness points for the feasible worst values are always negative
         (e.g., -90, -80, -75, -70, and -50). If a work center has only one indicator, its feasible best is
         assigned 100 effectiveness points and its feasible worst is assigned -100 effectiveness points.
      10.8.3. Plotting Known Values for Mission Effectiveness Charts.
         10.8.3.1. After refining the indicators and assigning relative weights to each, as suggested previ-
         ously, the facilitator proceeds to the last step in developing a mission effectiveness chart for each
         indicator. He helps workshop members identify the slopes of the curves for each chart. The facili-
         tator begins by showing members how to plot the previously determined values on the chart.
         10.8.3.2. The general form of a mission effectiveness chart is shown in Figure 10.3.. The vertical
         axis of a mission effectiveness chart shows an indicator's overall effectiveness or mission impact
         and is scaled from -100 through 0 to +100 in increments of ten. The vertical axis is the same for all
         mission effectiveness charts. The horizontal axis is used to record those values specific to a given
         indicator; these values will range from the feasible worst to the feasible best for that particular
         indicator. It is recommended that the facilitator prepare a transparency of the chart for use on an
         overhead projector to help in plotting these values.
         10.8.3.3. Using a transparency of the chart from Figure 10.3., as an example, the facilitator tells
         workshop members that they are at last ready to construct a mission effectiveness chart for their
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                          201


      Indicator #1, "Customer Satisfaction." The facilitator further explains that this chart will serve as
      a vehicle for providing feedback to them on their performance for this indicator. He also shows
      how their level of performance impacts the overall performance (mission) of the work center
      according to the values earned on the vertical axis.
      10.8.3.4. Workshop members are then shown that they made some important decisions about the
      chart when they defined the feasible best and worst for the indicator, in that these values represent
      the "end-points" of its horizontal axis. The facilitator labels the horizontal axis with the name of
      the indicator in question. He then marks the feasible best as the point (to the right) on the horizon-
      tal axis, and the feasible worst as the point (to the left) on the horizontal axis.
      10.8.3.5. Next, the facilitator fills in the intervals along the horizontal axis between the feasible
      worst and the feasible best. When under pressure to keep the process going, the facilitator may
      find it difficult to precisely scale between the two extremes, but workshop members will be under-
      standing and satisfied with a series of approximations. Later, when the mission effectiveness
      charts are automated or typed, an exact horizontal scale can be developed and the entire mission
      effectiveness chart can be presented for workshop review. Figure 10.6. shows such a scaling of
      the horizontal axis of Indicator #1 from Figure 10.5..

Figure 10.6. Customer Satisfaction Mission Effectiveness Chart with Horizontal Axis Scaled.




      10.8.3.6. Next, the facilitator tells workshop members that they have already developed three
      points for the mission effectiveness chart that represent three levels of performance on the indica-
      tor. These points are the normal performance point (or range) and effectiveness values for the fea-
      sible worst and best discussed previously.
      10.8.3.7. Figure 10.7. shows these three parts of the curve for the Figure 10.5. example. For this
      particular example, workshop members decided earlier that the range from 75 to 85 would repre-
      sent the expected performance, (i.e., 0 effectiveness 5, 80, and 85). This example is plotted in Fig-
      ure 10.7..

Figure 10.7. Normal Performance Range, Feasible Worst and Feasible Best Data Points Plotted for
Customer Satisfaction.




      10.8.3.8. Before asking workshop members to plot the intermediate points for its first chart, the
      facilitator should furnish and interpret several alternative mission effectiveness chart curves to
      illustrate the concept. Figure 10.8. shows two such alternatives (a dashed-line curve and a
      solid-line curve), as applied to the three plotted values presented in Figure 10.7..
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                         203


Figure 10.8. Alternative Slopes of Mission Effectiveness Charts for Customer Satisfaction.




       10.8.3.9. The dashed-line curve suggests that a very broad range of performance on the indicator
       (from 55% to 94% inquiries satisfied) has no positive or negative impact on mission, in that the
       effectiveness points vary only from -10 to 10. Performance above or below this range, however,
       has a substantial impact on the mission (75 and -50 effectiveness points, respectively).
       10.8.3.10. The solid-line curve in Figure 10.8. exhibits a very different pattern. According to this
       curve, immediately below the normal performance range (less than 75% inquiries satisfied) the
       mission impact becomes severe, falling from 0 to almost -50 effectiveness points for a mere differ-
       ence of 5% in indicator performance. Below the 70% level, however, the impact is already so bad
       that it can get only slightly worse. On the positive side, when performance exceeds the normal per-
       formance range (greater than 85%), the positive impact on the mission is dramatic; that is, an
       increase from 85% to 90% inquiries satisfied produces an increase in effectiveness points from 0
       to almost 75. Above the 90% level, the increase in mission impact is positive, but small by com-
       parison. As part of the instruction about these alternatives, the facilitator should stress to work-
       shop members that the slope of the curve is a graphic expression of their policy about the
       relationship between performance on the indicator and the impact on mission of various levels of
       performance expressed in effectiveness points.
       10.8.3.11. Workshop members learn to come to consensus quickly about the shape of curves for
       mission effectiveness charts, but the facilitator may wish to begin developing the first chart by
       asking questions such as these:
       IF THE IMPACT ON OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF 75% TO 85% INQUIRIES SATISFIED
       IS ZERO EFFECTIVENESS POINTS, HOW MUCH BETTER IS IT TO HAVE 90% OF
       INQUIRIES SATISFIED? HOW MUCH WORSE IS IT TO HAVE ONLY 70% SATISFIED,
       65% SATISFIED, 60% SATISFIED, ETC.?
204                                                             AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


         Answers to each question form data points that, when connected, result in the mission effective-
         ness curve. Not every point on the X-axis needs to be addressed. Only those points that show a
         change in slope.
         10.8.3.12. After the mission effectiveness chart for the first indicator is completed, the facilitator
         guides workshop members in a similar manner, completing the mission effectiveness charts for the
         remaining indicators.
      10.8.4. Checking Mission Effectiveness Charts.
         10.8.4.1. Before the facilitator submits the feedback system to management for review, members
         of the workshop should conduct two "sanity checks" of their mission effectiveness charts to make
         sure that the charts are both accurate and logical. The first check should come immediately after
         the charts are put into the form that they will be used for providing feedback to workers and man-
         agement. (This form can range from a fully automated procedure on a computer to simple typed
         copies that are photocopied for each measurement period.) At this time, workshop members
         should check their charts to make sure that all elements have been recorded and reproduced as
         originally specified.
         10.8.4.2. Another meeting to correct and change charts should take place when actual perfor-
         mance results on indicators are available from the first measurement period. At this stage, work-
         shop members should feel free to change their mission effectiveness charts in any way necessary.
         10.8.4.3. Besides improving the quality of charts, these meetings offer the added benefit of get-
         ting organization members into the habit of meeting to discuss their charts. Once the feedback sys-
         tem is in full operation, monthly meetings to check performance on mission effectiveness charts
         are essential and are the most powerful feature of this process. Feedback is widely believed to be
         the most important motivation to the improvement of performance. Monthly feedback meetings
         are also used to identify constraints to performance and to discuss "how to work smarter."
      10.8.5. Using Mission Effectiveness Charts.
         10.8.5.1. A mission effectiveness chart is developed for each effectiveness indicator. Two charts
         showing a work center policy on "Return Rate of Equipment" and "Inspections Passed" are shown
         in Figure 10.9.. The most important of the two indicators is the one for return rate. The slope of
         the curve on this chart is much steeper and has a greater range than the one for inspections passed.
         Its point value at feasible best is 100 while at feasible worst is -80. For inspections passed, the
         points earned for feasible best is 20 and for feasible worst is -80. Therefore, there is a greater
         impact, in point value, for a change in performance in return rate than for inspections passed.
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                         205


Figure 10.9. Examples of Mission Effectiveness Charts.




      10.8.5.2. A reading is taken for each indicator in a particular month, and its value is read on the
      X-axis. A vertical line from that reading will intersect the curve and give a point value along the
      Y-axis. Readings from all the effectiveness charts can be added together to get an overall effective-
      ness score for the month as shown in Figure 10.10.. This score can be compared in time with the
      score obtained in the baseline period to decide if there has been an improvement.

                      +39




      10.8.6. Options for Using the Range of Normal Performance. Work center personnel may identify a
      range of indicator values that they consider representative of normal or expected performance. If this
      is the case, there are three approaches that can be used to furnish feedback to personnel as shown in
      Figure 10.11..
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                       207


Figure 10.11. Options for the Range of Normal Performance.




      10.8.6.1. In option #1, performance is represented horizontally showing a range of normal perfor-
      mance. In this case there is no warning to work center personnel when a negative trend begins. We
      are not concerned about a change in performance within this range and none is shown.
      10.8.6.2. In option #2, a slight turn is made at the ends of this range to show a change in perfor-
      mance in both positive and negative directions. We now gain an early warning of a change in per-
208                                                              AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


         formance within the expected performance range and are able to correct a problem within the
         operation and stop a significant negative turn before it becomes a major problem.
         10.8.6.3. In option #3, the work center rates along the entire range of normal performance. The
         slope of this range should be slight, 5 or 10 points in either direction. Just enough to give an indi-
         cation of a trend. In effect, we wind up with a point of expected performance at the center of this
         range and an early indication of a potential problem.

10.9. Presentation of Functional Measurement Indicator Feedback.
      10.9.1. Local managers should be able to use this information to investigate the impact of manage-
      ment decisions they or higher-level managers make on a monthly basis. This allows faster feedback, a
      more rapid implementation of new ideas, and modification of procedures in work centers where per-
      formance is below established, acceptable levels.
      10.9.2. Indicators in a work center can be rolled-up for branch-level and top management-level
      review. Assure that the efficiency indicators are rolled up together and that effectiveness indicators are
      rolled up together. Each higher-management level would receive one efficiency indicator and one
      effectiveness indicator that show the performance of the subordinate work centers. One approach for
      rolling up data is to sum the changes of the individual indicator values for the work centers. The
      changes are obtained by comparing the value earned by an indicator for a particular month to the value
      earned in the baseline month or year. Assuming that 100% is a baseline level, each work center is of
      equal importance, and three separate work centers have these performance percentages:


          Work Center Percentage        Change


                   A       110%        +10


                   B        80%        -20


                   C       140%        +40


                       Change Total = +30


      Add the changes for a total of +30. This total is then added to 100% for a composite result. This result
      can then be monitored by work center personnel to compare the level of achievement in relation to
      established goals or past results. If the three work centers above were not of equal importance, suitable
      factors would be developed to scale the work centers to their level of importance before adding the
      changes together. If the same type of activity is present in several installations, subordinate work cen-
      ter performance can be rolled up to the organization level at each installation. This information could
      then be rolled up to the relevant command for review. The values for each command can be summed
      and used by the Air Staff OPR to evaluate changes in policy, procedures, and effectiveness of guid-
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                        209


   ance in relation to established goals or past performance. Also, this data can be used to develop por-
   tions of the annual Federal Productivity Report for the function.
   10.9.3. An example is shown here of how the minimum feedback data could be presented for the Base
   Supply Parts Issue Section at a base, a command, and Air Staff. The only limits on the approaches to
   present the data are your creativity and the available computer hardware and software.
       10.9.3.1. Base Level. Furnish a monthly count of the work center's available man-hours and out-
       put to find the efficiency and unit man-hour cost indicators. Supply data for effectiveness indica-
       tors to identify how well the work center is meeting established standards or goals or performing
       in comparison to a baseline period. Figure 10.12. shows six months of data for a branch. Two
       effectiveness counts are included, one for the number of rejects and the other for delivery time.
       The first four report entries (that is, input, output, efficiency, and unit man-hour cost), use the
       month of June as the baseline month. The last two entries; issue rate quality and delivery time are
       effectiveness entries and are compared to an established goal or a baseline month. Figure 10.13.
       shows a graphic presentation of these indicators. Several indicators may be displayed together
       (input, output, efficiency, and unit man-hour cost indicators) as shown in the top graph of Figure
       10.13., or each indicator can be displayed by itself (time of delivery) as shown in the lower graph
       of Figure 10.13.. Use the method that gets the information across to management most effectively.
       NOTE: All lines in Figure 10.13. begin at the baseline level of 100 in the baseline month of June.
       The value of each indicator in June establishes the baseline and later month indicator values are
       compared to the baseline month and percentage changes noted on the graph. If mission effective-
       ness charts are used, the effectiveness points earned each month are compared to the baseline
       month point values and the changes plotted. Remember that while graphically portrayed increases
       are usually associated with improvement, an increase for indicators such as cost or time might sig-
       nal that action is needed. Although only data for Branch A is shown, all branches being monitored
       would have similar presentations each month for the base functional OPR.

      10.9.3.2. Major Command Level. Every quarter the command OPR can view the functional mea-
      sures indicators for functions at each base in the command. One approach of rolling up the data to
      the mid-level OPR is to sum the data for each indicator every month and take an average for the

      in graphic form.

      performance of the MAJCOMs to develop a composite count and presentation for the Air Staff
      OPR. If semiannual reporting is desired, the data (using the two most current quarters) for each
      indicator is summed, averaged, and presented. The Air Staff OPR views the baseline deviations
      for the 6-month period for each indicator.

10.10. Implementing and Using the Feedback System for Continuous Improvement.
   10.10.1. The complete system of KRAs, indicators, and charts is briefed to higher management.
   Because this process maintains and supports the prerogatives of traditional management, the facilita-
   tor should make sure that some cautions are observed in this approval process.
   10.10.2. The facilitator should prebrief the manager to reaffirm the basic philosophy of the process. A
   key point of implementation is that the greatest gain in organizational performance comes from
   increasing worker motivation and restoring or increasing workers' pride in their work and sense of
   craftsmanship. These factors are especially important in a resource-constrained environment. In any
   case, management should be reminded that workers must feel a sense of ownership of their functional
   measures feedback system if its feedback component is to be motivational. Workers "buy into the
   feedback system" by creating the system themselves. Thus, management must appreciate that the cen-
   tral issue is not whether the system measures with great precision, but that it furnishes a platform or
   vehicle for continual improvement. Although overall accuracy is important, management should resist
   fine-tuning.
   10.10.3. The essence of good management is continual improvement. So, it really does not matter if
   a feasible best is 65 or 70 or that a normal performance point is 25 or 30. What is important, however,
   is that workers accept feedback from the mission effectiveness charts and are willing to use them to
   identify better ways of doing business. It's reasonable for management to disagree with and ask ques-
   tions about the system so long as workers maintain a feeling of ownership. In fact, management inter-
   est is stimulating to workers.
   10.10.4. Certainly, management must be assured that the system is measuring the important compo-
   nents of the mission. If the system does not capture the important components of the mission, then
   time and resources could be improperly diverted by the system into less important areas of work.
   However, if management changes the system unnecessarily—perhaps merely to show who is
   "boss"—workers will lose their sense of ownership and become resigned to "business as usual."
   They'll do only what they are told and without much enthusiasm. They will once again be unwilling to
   make suggestions about improvement. This, of course, would mean that the main purpose of the feed-
   back system has been defeated. Another way for the feedback system to be defeated is for manage-
   ment to be unresponsive to worker suggestions about how to improve the processes. Rather than being
   rule-bound and rigid, managers must play a supportive role and be willing to endorse improvement.
   10.10.5. A second concern of the facilitator should be to convince the higher-level managers not to
   expect to routinely monitor work center mission effectiveness charts. Mission effectiveness charts are
   not part of any reporting requirement to higher management. Instead, management will receive aggre-
   gated or "rolled-up" results of work center performance, as discussed in the previous section. Manag-
212                                                             AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


      ers need to appreciate that the mission effectiveness charts are intended for use only by the work
      center supervisor and workers as tools to improve work center performance.
      10.10.6. The facilitator should also make it clear to personnel involved in implementation that they
      need not fear management disapproval of the feedback system sent for review. In fact, such disap-
      proval, if handled correctly, can prove to be one of the most valuable facets of implementing the feed-
      back system. Initial disapproval requires that managers and workers engage in a dialogue to seek
      agreement on the details of the system. After reflection, most workers welcome this dialogue because
      management is expressing an interest in their work. The workers now have an opportunity to present
      their viewpoint to management. Managers also welcome such dialogue because its underlying pur-
      pose is improving organizational performance that is of vital importance to them. In such discussions,
      both sides usually make concessions to some degree and consensus is soon reached on the final sys-
      tem to use.
      10.10.7. As mentioned earlier, higher-level management has the right to approve or change the feed-
      back system. Therefore, the facilitator should present the feedback system to workers realistically and
      in this light. The facilitator should stress that the feedback system represents an opportunity for work-
      ers to make suggestions to management about the best way to measure and improve organizational
      performance. The facilitator should create a positive outlook, with the expectation that most sugges-
      tions will likely be accepted by management. This is especially so since management took part in
      developing the feedback system. Workers are encouraged to develop a sense of ownership of the feed-
      back system. However, the facilitator must also make sure they are fully aware of management pre-
      rogatives. They shouldn't naively believe that management will automatically accept everything they
      suggest. If the facilitator allows workers to believe that acceptance of their suggestions will be auto-
      matic, changes that result from management review are likely to surprise and disillusion workers.
      Then, instead of having workers who are interested and motivated, the opposite may occur.

                                               Chapter 11

                                 RATIO UNIT TIMES STANDARDS

11.1. General Concepts. Ratio unit times for development of manpower standards have been expanded
to include large populations, as well as single location and small population standards. The decision to use
ratio unit times for large populations should be based on analysis of workload count variations. If the
workload counts do not vary widely from one location to another, ratio unit times are appropriate. If there
is a wide variation, consider breaking the large population into smaller ones (e.g., small workload count,
medium workload count, large workload count). If this is not feasible or desirable, then use regression
analysis as outlined in Chapter 2. This chapter addresses development procedures to be followed when
using ratio unit times.

11.2. Population Definition.
   11.2.1. Single location is applicable when the function under study is peculiar to one location or the
   service furnished (mode of operation) is very different from other locations.
   11.2.2. Small population is defined as a population consisting of two, three, or four locations.
   11.2.3. Large population is defined as a population of five or more locations. (NOTE: it is possible
   that large populations can be broken down to smaller populations based on analysis of workload data)

11.3. Input Data.
   11.3.1. The quality of the input data is important in any study. However, it becomes increasingly
   important for small populations and single location studies because of the limited amount of data
   available. Accuracy is of great importance when limited measurement is possible. Since it is the only
   information available, it is essential to get the best estimate(s) possible.
   11.3.2. When using Operational Audit (OA) as the primary measurement method, get multiple time
   estimates to find the best representation of the per accomplishment times. Procedures for handling
   multiple readings are in Chapter 9. Evaluate these measurements carefully, using available statistical
   analysis techniques.
   11.3.3. Accuracy is also critical when work sampling (WS) is selected as the prime measurement
   method. Do WS as prescribed in Chapter 15.

11.4. Ratio Unit Times.
   11.4.1. The ratio (b-value) is the result of measured direct man-hours divided by the associated work-
   load. It represents the direct man-hours needed to produce one unit of work. The ratio development
   process is similar for both OA and WS except for one distinct difference: SIAMs are not used in WS;
   therefore, the final equation developed using WS doesn’t need adjustment.
   11.4.2. Equations developed by ratio unit times takes one of two forms, depending on whether or not
   the fixed man-hours are separated from the variable man-hours (see Table 11.1.).
       11.4.2.1. The first equation form is: Y = a + b1X1 + b2X2 + … + bnXn where the a-value represents
       the sum of the fixed man-hours and the b-values represent the ratios of the variable man-hours to
       their respective WLFs.
216                                                             AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


         11.4.2.2. The second equation form is Y = b1X1 + b2X2 + … +bnXn and is the same as the first
         equation except there is no a-value. Use of the second equation is optional.
         11.4.2.3. Associate variable man-hours with processes or steps that are expected to show a rela-
         tionship with the selected WLF.
      11.4.3. An example of using ratio unit times for a single location standard with the first equation form
      is shown in Table 11.1..

      11.4.4. The ratio unit times procedure can be extended to develop small population and large popula-
      tion standards. To do so:
         11.4.4.1. When only one WLF is used, sum the variable man-hours for that WLF for each loca-
         tion. Divide this sum by the sum of WLF values to form a ratio. (see Table 11.2.)

                                        STAFFING PATTERN

12.1. General Concepts. Certain work centers do not require work measurement to develop all or part of
a standard. In these work centers, the objective of determining the manpower requirement can be met at
less cost with acceptable validity by using functional models (Chapter 6), minimum manpower situation
(Chapter 7), staffing pattern (including directed organizational positions), and SIAMs (Chapter 13).
Use these methods in combination with measured data.

12.2. Staffing Pattern.
   12.2.1. A staffing pattern recognizes long-standing use of manpower and standard operating proce-
   dures in a work center responsible for subordinate organizational elements. A directed organization
   position (for example, a commander) and the associated direct support position (for example, vice
   commander and secretary) are examples of a staffing pattern. The study team decides if a workload
   factor is relevant when using a staffing pattern. The size of the organization, in terms of manpower
   requirements or the number of subordinate elements, may drive the size of the work center. Explain
   pattern variations between locations in terms of workload or conditional factors. A staffing pattern,
   used as the basis for a standard, may result in a quantitative expression that is variable in terms of
   workload or may result in a constant manpower requirement for all applicable locations. The staffing
   pattern is normally used in work centers that command or manage two or more subordinate elements.
   Use the staffing pattern when these apply.
       12.2.1.1. The work center is a specified element of a formal organizational structure approved by
       HQ USAF/XPM
       12.2.1.2. The work center is reasonably stable as shown by consistent use of manpower in terms
       of the number, AFSCs, and grades of personnel over at least a 2-year period.
   12.2.2. Directed organization position specifies a fixed manpower requirement to fill a particular
   named assignment (that is, wing commander, installation commander, etc.). This requirement is
   essential to the existence of a work center and will not change regardless of increases or decreases in
   workload or changes in the MAF. The directed organization position is usually the result of a staffing
   pattern or operational audit study. The directed organization position requirement is dictated by the
   need for one to be on duty in a given office of responsibility even though the individual may not be
   continuously productive. The man-hours that the given office must be manned are required
   man-hours. If a policy calls for several assistant personnel in a given office at a particular time, mea-
   sure the assistants to validate the need. Do not conduct a measurement in the case of a stated two-man
   policy that is driven by security or safety reasons.

                      STANDARD INDIRECT ALLOWED MAN-HOURS (SIAM)

13.1. General Concepts. To meet the needs for flexibility and accuracy, each functional OPR needs a
Standard Indirect Description (SID) that fits their function. There are eleven categories of indirect work:
Administers Civilian Employee, Administers Officer, Administers Enlisted Personnel, Directs Work Cen-
ter Activity, Provides Administrative Support, Prepares for and Conducts/Attends Meeting, Administers
Training, Manages Supplies, Maintains Equipment (Non Aircraft Maintenance Function), Maintains
Equipment (Aircraft Maintenance Function), and Performs Cleanup. A "shopping list" method allows the
functional and manpower communities to decide which SID tasks apply. Each SID task has an associated
predetermined man-hour value. These predetermined man-hours are referred to as Standard Indirect
Allowed Man-hours (SIAM) values. They were developed as a nonmeasurement method for determining
a work center's indirect man-hour requirements. This concept uses standardized (core) indirect tasks that
are common to most Air Force work centers. Indirect tasks are published in AFMS 00AA, Standard Indi-
rect Allowed Man-hours. (NOTE: AFMIA is currently conducting an in-depth review of the SIAM. Once
this review has been completed, updated guidance will be forthcoming. Until this review is complete, the
instructions in this chapter should be followed.)

13.2. Classifying Work as Direct or Indirect.
      13.2.1. When developing a Process Oriented Description (POD), all of the allowed productive work
      done by the work center is documented. This process describes the work in enough detail to allow for
      accurate measurement of the work center manpower requirements. All work needed to produce an end
      item (work unit) is grouped together as a process. Each process is represented by a work unit. Set up
      processes for all productive work, then classify the processes of work as either direct or indirect. This
      is often where problems begin.
      13.2.2. Direct work defines productive work that directly relates to the work center producing an end
      product. It also defines work that is in direct support of the mission. Indirect work defines productive
      work that must be done, but does not directly relate to the work center producing an end product.
      Unlike direct work, it does not directly support the mission, e.g., preparing an enlisted performance
      report.
      13.2.3. The SID defines all allowed core indirect work. This work is classified as indirect only when
      it's in support of the work center where it's done. Classify work done in support of subordinate work
      centers as direct work. In the latter case, these work centers are called "overhead" functions. These
      functions have direct management responsibility for one or more subordinate work centers.
      13.2.4. Classify most tasks in the categories of Administers Civilian, Administers Officer, Adminis-
      ters Enlisted Personnel, Directs Work Center Activity, and Provides Administrative Support as indi-
      rect or direct. Classify tasks performed for subordinate work centers as direct work. This means that it
      is possible to have the same activities in both direct processes and indirect categories of work.
      AFMAN 38-208, Volume 1, Table 3.2, is a decision logic table for identifying tasks in the SID as
      either direct or indirect.
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                          221


13.3. SIAM Task Data Sheets. SIAM Task Data Sheets have been developed for each task in the SID.
These task data sheets were designed for determining which SID tasks apply to the function to be mea-
sured, and how the task is classified. Task data sheets are located in AFMS 00AA.
   13.3.1. Task Title. Shows the task number and title as documented in AFMS 00AA. Task numbers
   will always remain unchanged.
   13.3.2. Definition. Shows the task definition as documented in AFMS 00AA. Exercise caution to
   make sure the complete definition applies. If any portion does not apply, do not use the SIAM
   man-hour equation. Measure the task using the measurement instructions shown on the task sheets.
   13.3.3. Applicability. The applicability statement defines those circumstances that could preclude the
   use of the SIAM man-hour equation. Some examples are:
       13.3.3.1. The activity frequency used to develop the SIAM man-hour equation may differ from
       the natural rate of occurrence in the work center being measured.
       13.3.3.2. When the work being performed is done by an overhead or another work center. The
       SIAMs may be applicable as a direct task rather than indirect, e.g., processing mail. Processing
       mail is normally credited in the indirect tasks, Processes Unclassified Incoming Distribution and
       Processes Unclassified Outgoing Distribution. A work center with a large volume of mail to pro-
       cess might have a full-time mail clerk. In this case, the work is classified as direct. No additional
       credit should be given for this workload through SIAMs.
   13.3.4. Task Classification. The "shopping list" approach credits the work center with indirect
   man-hours. Man-hours associated with these tasks are identified as either fixed, variable, or person-
   nel-generated.
       13.3.4.1. Fixed Task Man-Hours. Fixed task man-hours do not vary with selected workload factor
       and are independent of the work center size.
       13.3.4.2. Variable Task Man-Hours. Variable task man-hours have a direct relationship to the
       selected work units produced or selected workload factor. There are only a few indirect tasks that
       have been identified as variable, all in categories 9 and 10, Maintains Equipment.
       13.3.4.3. Personnel-Generated Task Man-Hours. Personnel-generated task man-hours vary with
       the number of personnel assigned to the work center. They are not expected to show a direct rela-
       tionship to the selected workload factor or remain constant. They are expected to relate to the total
       (direct and indirect) fixed and variable man-hours expended by the personnel in the work center.
       Personnel-generated task man-hours will be credited to the work center based on the average
       assigned strength of the work center. However, there are exceptions. For example, a work center
       has two officers assigned, and one officer is the work center supervisor or officer in charge (OIC).
       Only credit indirect man-hours for preparing Officer Performance Reports (OPRs) for one officer.
       Credit the preparation of the OIC's OPR as direct work to the overhead work center. PAT remeas-
       urement for this task as direct work is not needed. Use the standard indirect task time (b value) and
       determine the activity frequency from the measurement instructions of the pertinent SIAMs Task
       Data Sheet. The same logic and rationale applies to every personnel-generated task in the SID.
   13.3.5. Man-hour Equation. For some tasks, the allowed monthly man-hours have been converted to
   a per accomplishment time to help the craftsman and OPR in analyzing the task time for applicability.
   For example, task I3.3. Types Enlisted Evaluation, has a monthly man-hour value of 0.06193 per
   enlisted person assigned (less one if the work center supervisor is enlisted). In most instances, this
222                                                            AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


      block also gives a per-unit accomplishment time. For example, task I3.3 allows 0.93 man-hours per
      enlisted evaluation typed. This information can be helpful when telling how much time is being cred-
      ited to a work center for a certain task.
      13.3.6. Measurement Instructions. This section shows the full instructions for determining the activ-
      ity frequency and per accomplishment time when measurement is used in lieu of SIAMs. Follow these
      instructions explicitly, since they were used to develop the SIAMs. AF Form 1040 is completed IAW
      the chapter on operational audit.

13.4. Using SIAMs.
      13.4.1. Selecting the SIAM Task. There is more to selecting a SIAM task than merely looking at the
      task title. There are four important steps that MUST be followed when selecting a SIAM task.
         13.4.1.1. Step 1. Using the task title as a point of departure, find out whether or not the task is
         done in the work center being measured.
         13.4.1.2. Step 2. Read the task definition. If ALL of the task definition elements apply to the work
         center being measured, then proceed to the next step. If ANY of the task definition elements are
         not done, or additional elements are done, the SIAM task man-hours CANNOT be used. You must
         measure this task using the task measurement instructions.
         13.4.1.3. Step 3. Read the applicability statement. If the work center being measured satisfies all
         of the applicability criteria, proceed to the next step. If ANY of the applicability criteria ARE
         NOT satisfied, the SIAM task man-hours CANNOT be used. You must measure this task using the
         task measurement instructions.
         13.4.1.4. Step 4. The last check is for logic. Is the SIAM allowed time representative of what nor-
         mally occurs in this work center? If it's too high or too low, you must measure this task using the
         task measurement instructions.
      13.4.2. SIAM Measurement. With these modifications, AF Forms 1040 will be completed IAW the
      chapter on operational audit (see Chapter 9).
         13.4.2.1. Fixed Tasks. The fixed task allowed monthly man-hours (a value) will be entered in col-
         umn 5F, Per Month, of the AF Form 1040. An activity frequency code of "S" and a per accom-
         plishment code of "F" will be entered in column 5H, Type Data, of the AF Form 1040.
         13.4.2.2. Variable Tasks. The variable task activity frequency will be entered in column 5B,
         Activity Frequency, and a frequency conversion code of "7" will be entered in column 5C, Freq.
         Code, of the AF Form 1040. An activity frequency code of "S" will be entered in column 5H, Type
         Data, of the AF Form 1040. The per accomplishment time, Column 5E, will be the "b value" from
         the SIAMs equation. A per accomplishment code of "V" will be entered in column 5H, Type Data,
         of the AF Form 1040.
         13.4.2.3. Personnel-Generated Tasks. Enter the personnel-generated task activity frequency
         (number of the assigned personnel for the pertinent task) in column 5B, Activity Frequency, and a
         frequency conversion code of "7" in column 5C, Freq. Code, of the AF Form 1040. Enter an activ-
         ity frequency code of "S" in column 5H, Type Data, of the AF Form 1040. Enter the per accom-
         plishment time, the "b value" from the SIAM equation, in column 5E. Enter a per accomplishment
         code of "P" in column 5H, Type Data, of the AF Form 1040.

13.5. Alternate Indirect Man-Hour Measurement Methods:
   13.5.1. In addition to the SIAM, several other standard indirect measurement methods are available to
   provide flexibility in responding to the dynamic expeditionary nature of our aerospace forces. These
   tools include the Standard Indirect Allowed Man-Hour Equation (SIAME), Direct and Indirect Man-
   power Equation (DIME) and the Capabilities Based Manpower Determinant (CBMD) Standard Indi-
   rect Allowance Factor (SIAF).
      13.5.1.1. The Air Force is transforming to a capabilities-focused Expeditionary Air and Space
      Force. In doing so, our goal is to make warfighting effects, and the capabilities we need to achieve
      them, the drivers for everything we do. In addressing this Air Force goal, we define manpower
      requirements in an environment of global engagement with expeditionary forces performing capa-
      bilities. We call this manpower quantification the CBMD.
      13.5.1.2. The CBMD SIAF is designed to address indirect man-hours or indirect fractional man-
      ning when computing a CBMD manpower requirement. The DIME is designed to address indirect
      man-hours or fractional manning when combining all CBMDs for a determination of manpower
      requirements at the organizational level or function.
   13.5.2. Each tool is discussed in detail in the following paragraphs. Table 13.1., Standard Indirect
   Measurement Tools Decision Logic Table, describes the advantages and disadvantages of each tool
   and when they are recommended for use.
224                                                               AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003

13.6. Standard Indirect Allowed Man-Hour Equation (SIAME)
      13.6.1. The SIAME is an alternate method of crediting indirect man-hours for Operational Audit and
      Time Study standards. Direct and SIAME man-hours are added to determine total monthly man-hours
      for work centers of five or more assigned personnel.
      13.6.2. The SIAME was developed using the FAC family approach. Functional areas were analyzed
      by reviewing the primary mission, types of specialties used, and organizational levels within the func-
      tion. Associated FACs were then grouped into SIAME families using the following definitions:
         13.6.2.1. Management and Administration Work Centers. These work centers have the primary
         function of managing subordinate organizational elements and providing unit administrative sup-
         port. Examples include the medical support squadron’s personnel and administration flight, the
         civil engineer unit administration and the operations squadron’s operations officer and the mainte-
         nance officer.

      13.6.2.2. Production and Staff Support Work Centers. These work centers have the primary func-
      tion of supporting the production area of an organization and researching, evaluating, reporting,
      coordinating, and advising. Examples include the wing manpower and organization office, the
      comptroller squadron financial analysis flight, the civil engineering or services squadron’s
      resource management flights and the medical support squadron’s medical information services
      flight.
      13.6.2.3. Customer Service Work Centers. These work centers have the primary function of pro-
      viding specific services to customers. Examples include the military and civilian personnel flights,
      base billeting, military pay and travel.
      13.6.2.4. Medical Work Centers. These work centers include medical facilities and dental ser-
      vices.
      13.6.2.5. Warehouse, Storage, and Issue. These work centers have the primary function of receiv-
      ing, storing, or issuing material. Examples include the supply squadron material storage and distri-
      bution flight and fuels management flight.
      13.6.2.6. Industrial Shop. These work centers have the primary function of testing, overhauling,
      repairing, or manufacturing specific products. Examples include aerospace ground equipment and
      vehicle maintenance.
      13.6.2.7. Table 13.2., Air Force Peacetime SIAME Families reflects the SIAME for each of the

      applies. If ANY of the indirect task definition elements are not done, or additional elements are
      done, a variance must be developed to supplement the DIME. In this case, you must measure this
      task using the SIAM Task Measurement Instructions reflected on the SIAM Task Data Sheet.
      These measured man-hours are then added or subtracted, as appropriate, from the results of the
      DIME application.
      13.6.3.2. Y (SIAME) = Indirect man-hours from application of the applicable SIAME.
      13.6.3.3. Y(Tot) = Total direct and indirect man-hours. Y(Tot) = Y(Dir) + Y (SIAME)
      13.6.3.4. Application. The standards development team develops a direct manpower equation,
      Y(Dir), using measured direct time and an indirect equation, Y (SIAME), using the selected SIAME
      and the average number of assigned work center personnel as the workload factor. The direct
      equation results are added to the SIAME results to derive the total monthly man-hours.
          13.6.3.4.1. Application Example: Using a notional Y(Dir) = 300 + 5.6555X equation,
              Y(Dir) = 300 + 5.6555X (Where X(Dir) = Workload Factor = 250 Vehicles Assigned).
              Y(Dir) = 300 + 5.6555(250) = 1713.88.
              Y (SIAME) = 270.13 + 9.3033X (X(SIAME) = 12 Average Assigned Personnel).
              Y (SIAME) = 270.13 + 9.3033 (12) = 381.77 Indirect Man-Hours
              Y(Tot) = Y (DIR) + Y (SIAME) = Y (Tot)
              Y(Tot) = 1713.88 + 381.77 = 2095.65 Total Man-Hours
   13.6.4. Using SIAME:
      13.6.4.1. The study team must use caution when selecting the SIAME. Review the FAC family
      definitions in paragraphs 13.6.2.1. through 13.6.2.6. and select the SIAME that best fits the work
      center or function being studied. Ensure the standard indirect description reflected in AFMS00AA
      applies. If ANY of the indirect task definition elements are not done, or additional elements are

         13.7.2.1. Y(Dir) = Direct manpower from application of a manpower equation and subsequent con-
         version to a manpower requirement by applying the applicable MAF.
         13.7.2.2. Y(DIME) = Total manpower requirement by applying the direct manpower (Y(Dir)) in the
         applicable DIME.
         13.7.2.3. Application. Prior to using the DIME model it is necessary to quantify the total func-
         tional direct manpower (Y(DIR)). This is accomplished by determining the total direct required
         monthly man-hours for the function and dividing by the appropriate MAF. The study team selects
         the appropriate DIME (Y(DIME)) model (See Table 13.3. ) and applies direct manpower as the
         independent variable. The DIME produces the total direct and indirect manpower.
         13.7.2.4. Application Example: Using a notional Y(Dir) = 300 + 5.6555X equation,
                Y(Dir) = 300 + 5.6555X (Where X(Dir) = Workload Factor = 250 Vehicles Assigned).
                Y(Dir) = 300 + 5.6555(250) = 1713.88 Direct Man-Hours.
                1713.88/149.6 = 11.46 Direct Manpower
                Y (DIME) = 1.81 + 1.0681X (Where X = Direct Manpower).
                Y (DIME) = 1.81 + 1.0681 (11.46) = 14.05 Total Functional Manpower Requirement.

                                                TIME STUDY

14.1. General Concepts.
      14.1.1. Time study is a work measurement method that records the time a worker takes to do each ele-
      ment of an operation in a specified way. A pace rating factor is applied to the recorded times to adjust
      them according to the pace of an average worker. The total of the elemental allowed times then gives
      the standard for the operation.
      14.1.2. Time study is used primarily to measure operations that are repetitive, of short duration, and
      done at one work station.
      14.1.3. The purposes of time study are:
         14.1.3.1. To analyze the operations and job conditions to improve existing methods.
         14.1.3.2. To increase the effectiveness of effort by using only necessary motions.
         14.1.3.3. To establish standard conditions for an efficient operation.
         14.1.3.4. To set up consistent and fair standards of performance.
         14.1.3.5. To furnish reliable data for use in constructing equations and charts.
      14.1.4. In addition, use time study to develop elemental standards to synthesize time standards for
      operations that have the same elements in different combinations. This eliminates the need for remea-
      surement.
      14.1.5. Although few situations meet the time study prerequisites of being both highly standardized
      and repetitive, the broad use and acceptance of the method, coupled with its accuracy advantages,
      warrants its consideration. However, if the prerequisites are not met, do not use the method.

14.2. Verification of the Process Oriented Description (POD). The time study method is generally
used for some portions of the POD. To do this:
      14.2.1. Verify that the portion of the POD to be time-studied is properly designed. Make sure each
      step describes the operations in the proper sequence with definite beginning and ending points.
      14.2.2. Ensure the POD agrees with governing directives and local performance procedures. Signifi-
      cant differences from location to location may cause variances in timing and result in inaccurate val-
      ues. Resolve any differences before timing operations.

14.3. Wartime Operation Measurement. Time study is not applicable for functions where wartime and
peacetime operations differ. Since this technique needs step repetition, the OPR must apply a great
amount of effort and expense to duplicate the wartime situation for measurement. Thus, the amount of
effort involved may not justify the practicality of this measurement method.

14.4. How to do Time Study.
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                          243


  14.4.1. Set up a system to record daily work counts. If the work center activities do not allow this to
  be done, record the work unit count as the work is finished. Use production reports, but get enough
  data to verify them, make valid comparisons, and set an average workload level.
  14.4.2. Find the time study method that best fits the work situation to accurately measure the various
  steps. Two basic ways of reading a watch when doing a time study are the snapback method and con-
  tinuous method.
     14.4.2.1. In the snapback (repetitive) method, record a reading after timing each element, and then
     reset the watch back to zero.
         14.4.2.1.1. Advantages of this method are that it eliminates the need for making subtractions
         to find element time and that it also facilitates rapid analysis of variations in readings for each
         element per cycle.
         14.4.2.1.2. Disadvantages of this method are that it does not present a clear picture of the
         sequence in which the elements were done and that the extent and nature of foreign elements
         as they occur are not always recorded. In addition, unavoidable errors occur due to the time
         needed to snap the watch back to zero.
     14.4.2.2. In the continuous method, the watch runs continuously from the beginning to the end of
     the study. Record the time at the end of each element.
         14.4.2.2.1. An advantage of this method is that every event that occurs is recorded and is
         traceable back to the actual sequence of occurrence. This makes it easy to handle elements that
         occur out of normal sequence.
         14.4.2.2.2. The disadvantage of this method is that additional time is needed to develop the
         elemental time.
     14.4.2.3. The use of either the snapback or continuous method is at the discretion of the crafts-
     man. However, Figure 14.1. displays the various characteristics that contribute to the use of each
     method and should be taken into account when selecting a particular timing method. For example,
     when checking a job situation to be timed, use Figure 14.1. to select a timing method. If at least
     six job situation attributes are identified in a timing method, then that method should be favorably
     considered for use.

      14.4.3. When conducting the study:
         14.4.3.1. Identify elements to be timed to make sure that they are recognizable and have obvious
         beginning and ending points before starting the study. Audible beginning and ending points makes
         the process easier.
         14.4.3.2. Make a sketch showing the equipment used, flow of work, significant distances traveled
         by the operator, and unusual working conditions.
         14.4.3.3. Record stopwatch readings on DD Forms 2042, Work Measurement Time Study
         Worksheet (snapback); DD Form 2042-1, Work Measurement Time Study Worksheet (Con-
         tinuous Method); or DD Form 2043, Work Measurement Project Non-Repetitive Time Study.
         The Industrial Engineering Handbook and the commercial texts on motion and time study discuss
         the various timing techniques that may be used.
         14.4.3.4. Take readings for 5 to 20 cycles to find the number of good readings needed.
         14.4.3.5. Circle and do not use those readings that are obviously inaccurate because of fumbles,
         distractions, or changes in methods.
         14.4.3.6. Pace rate each timed element. The technician compares the observed pace (speed) of
         work done to a predetermined normal pace (see paragraph 15.17.2.).

14.5. Determining Sample Size.

  14.5.1. Find the number of readings needed after measuring a relatively small number of cycles.
  Include the first cycle readings as part of the total needed. Observe complete cycles of an operation
  and take readings on all elements of the cycle. The number of cycle readings needed is the highest
  number needed for any one element.
  14.5.2. Table 14.1. gives instructions to compute the number of samples needed.

                                                 Chapter 15

                                         WORK SAMPLING (WS)

15.1. General Concepts.
      15.1.1. WS is a measurement method based on the principle that random samples taken from a large
      group tend to keep the same distribution characteristics as the group. Conclusions are drawn about the
      population based on the sample. The WS method relies heavily on input technicians to collect accu-
      rate samples and workload information.
      15.1.2. The method defines processes, makes observations, computes percentage of occurrence for
      each process, and applies these percentages to man-hours sampled.

15.2. Wartime Operation Measurement. The WS method has limited application for a wartime envi-
ronment because of the time needed to successfully do a measurement of this type. Another drawback is
that if peacetime data, measured by WS, is converted to wartime values, consistency between peacetime
and wartime policy and procedures must be assumed. Conversion in this instance is limited to workload
and the MAF only. The most likely arena for WS in a wartime operation is a realistic and representative
exercise or operational readiness inspection.

15.3. Applying WS.
      15.3.1. WS is commonly used to determine equipment utilization; analyze work distribution; conduct
      methods improvement studies; and compute and verify personal, rest, and delay (PR&D) allowances.
      WS is most effective when work centers have:
         15.3.1.1. Nonrepetitive or irregular work.
         15.3.1.2. Many different processes of work.
         15.3.1.3. Many workers in a relatively small area.
      15.3.2. Take care when identifying work centers to be sampled. Historically, work centers requiring
      product analysis, closed-session counseling, or creative thinking have been difficult to sample. For
      these work centers, consider using productive and nonproductive sampling (see paragraph 15.21.1.).
      Some office work is difficult to quantify by WS because the work is not cyclical or is completed over
      a long period of time. Also, work cycles may be variable because of the many different products.

15.4. Economic Desirability of WS.
      15.4.1. The economic desirability of WS increases with the number of people being sampled. Each
      measurement technician should measure a minimum of five workers where possible; however, those
      being sampled may be assigned to more than one work center, for example, family of standards. Gen-
      erally, measure a work center with two or less people by OA unless it is necessary to observe standby
      time or the need for an assistant. When several input points have four or less people to be measured, it
      is not economical to conduct a WS study.
      15.4.2. The measurement work force should consist of personnel who spend most of their available
      time in a place that allows for observation of work. Account for work done away from the immediate
      work center for extended periods of time as follows:
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                        255


      15.4.2.1. Arrange for a measurement technician to observe the worker at the out-of-area location.
      15.4.2.2. Sample this time as out-of-area and OA this time if it is not feasible to observe the
      worker. Account for out-of-area samples by applicable process on the daily observation sheet.
      However, do not transfer these samples to the AF Form 1111, Work Sampling Record. Merge
      out-of-area time later with WS time on the AF Form 308. For multipoint standards, study teams
      furnish guidance in the measurement plan for treatment of these samples.
      15.4.2.3. Do not plan for more observations than a technician can do in a reasonable period. Giv-
      ing the measuring technician too many personnel or too many work centers may not allow timely
      observations and may bias the sampling data. Conversely, giving the measuring technician too few
      personnel is not economically feasible.

15.5. Briefings for WS.
   15.5.1. Study Inbriefing. Make sure the work center supervisor and workers fully understand the prin-
   ciple of WS during the inbriefing. Because its statistical basis makes WS difficult to understand, use
   illustrations without technical terms. Use simple explanations to eliminate confusion and allow work
   center personnel to understand the WS principle. Some examples of situations similar in principle to
   WS are: testing antifreeze in a car radiator, taking blood samples, or trying one package of cigarettes
   before buying a carton. Since all of these actions represent the source from which they come, the opin-
   ions formed from the samples are valid for the whole product. Explain during inbriefing that WS daily
   observation sheets are to be treated confidentially and not shown to supervisors or managers. Sam-
   pling data must never be used by superiors to evaluate individuals.
   15.5.2. Study Outbriefing. Summarize process percentages of occurrence for presentation during out-
   briefings. A pie chart is a convenient way to graphically present this information. Brief local OPRs on
   measured man-hours and workload factor values. Cover the treatment of assumed and inferred work.
   Tell local OPRs measurement results do not represent the final standard. The study team does C&R
   analysis and computes the final standard using data from measurement points.

15.6. WS Process Development.
   15.6.1. Write the Process Oriented Description (POD) for WS at the same level as for OA, or write it
   at the broader process level. Study teams may derive step times by using the percentage estimates
   described in paragraph 15.21.. In either case, write the POD to facilitate observation during sampling.
   Make sure processes in the POD cover all required work, and are clearly distinctive, yet mutually
   exclusive.
   15.6.2. Select processes for both direct and indirect work. Further define the process by using steps.
   Each step must be discrete and understandable to the observer. Failure to clearly define processes dis-
   torts process percentages and later makes analysis and standard maintenance difficult.
   15.6.3. WS studies identify time spent in available and nonavailable activities. Available time is
   broadly classified as productive (direct and indirect) and nonproductive. Examples of nonavailable
   activities are: leave, medical absences, TDY for training, and additional duties. Additional processes
   for management information such as additional duties may be described and measured during WS.
   15.6.4. Nonproductive categories, for sampling purposes, are personal and rest, idle (extended lunch)
   and unavoidable delay. Other nonproductive categories may be added when needed, for example,
   assumed and inferred. Do not use other and miscellaneous for nonproductive category titles as they
256                                                            AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


      become catchalls during WS studies. Usually, productive indirect and nonproductive activities are
      sampled at the category level. Data collected for these categories is useful when outbriefing WS
      results. Treatment of lunch and unscheduled time is described in these paragraphs.
         15.6.4.1. Sample lunch to account for productive time expended during the lunch period and to
         account for nonproductive time taken for an extended lunch. Sampling of lunch eases the account-
         ing of samples at the end of each sampling day. Be cautious when selecting random times and
         making observations during the lunch period. Incorrect accounting of lunch samples affects other
         process percentages. Study teams give specific guidance on treatment of lunch observations in the
         measurement plan. This example illustrates the need for caution: Assume three observations per
         hour are being taken and the lunch period for half the work center is 1100 to 1200. Assume the
         other half takes lunch from 1200 to 1300. Select random times so that three observations occur
         between 1100 and 1200 and three occur between 1200 and 1300. The sampling technician nor-
         mally records three samples for lunch for each worker. However, if worker A (from the first
         group) was working at 1145 (observation time) and did not take his or her full lunch hour, then one
         productive sample and two lunch samples would be recorded. On the other hand, if worker B
         (from the second group) left for lunch at his or her regular time and was still on lunch break at
         1310 (observation time), then three lunch samples and one idle or extended lunch sample would
         be recorded for worker B. If lunch periods are staggered or workers do not take scheduled lunch
         breaks, this example is inappropriate. In this case, sample lunch cautiously and check the percent-
         age of lunch samples daily and at the end of the study to verify representativeness.
         15.6.4.2. An unscheduled (U) category is useful for keeping accountability of samples. Use this
         category when:
             15.6.4.2.1. Shift changes are staggered during a multi-shift operation.
             15.6.4.2.2. Workers are doing required work before the beginning or after the end of a sched-
             uled shift.

15.7. POD Verification. As part of the verification process, accomplish the following:
      15.7.1. Investigate the operation of the work center thoroughly before beginning the study. Check
      organizational structure, mission requirements, directives, and other pertinent factors such as back-
      logs, work cycles, and historical production.
      15.7.2. Review the POD. Contact the study team for guidance if steps are found that are not in the
      approved POD. Measure such steps separately. The study team, in cooperation with the OPR during
      data analysis, makes the final decision to include or disallow these steps in the manpower standard. If
      the study team determines the added steps apply to all work centers, the POD is changed.

15.8. Work Counts (Work Units and Potential WLFs). Man-hours collected during WS studies repre-
sent only one part of the data needed to compute an equation. The other part is work counts. Set up a work
count system to record workload on a daily basis. If work counts are not completed daily, then record
them as frequently as the work is completed. Use a production report if it is available, but make periodic
checks to make sure of its accuracy. Make sure the period of the production report corresponds with the
study period. Pay particular attention to recording correct values for work started before the study and
work continuing after the study. Do not include work unit counts for days sampled but dropped from com-
putations for nonrepresentativeness. Adjust the average daily work counts to an average monthly figure.
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                         257


Use this figure as the independent variable for the standard man-hour equation. Use total
monthly-allowed man-hours as the dependent variable. An exception to this procedure is allowed when
the potential WLF is nonproduction oriented. For example, population serviced may be relatively con-
stant on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. In this case, use population serviced as reported for the time
frame closest to the WS period for the dependent variable.

15.9. Determining Sampling Period.
   15.9.1. Sample at least one complete cycle during the measurement period. The normal sampling
   period is 21 days (minimum of 15 usable days). When necessary, extend the sampling period to make
   sure it covers a complete cycle.
   15.9.2. Conduct WS over a representative period or work cycle. Ideally, use WS when a normal
   period of productivity is to be measured and when relatable work units are available. When a work
   cycle is longer than a month, the study team decides the feasibility of using WS. Also, if several indi-
   viduals in a small work center are on leave during the sampling period, this may affect representative-
   ness. In a 7-day work center, be sure to keep a representative proportion between weekend days and
   weekdays during the sampling period. For example, when 21 usable days are needed, six of those days
   should be weekend days.
   15.9.3. Use the experience of work center personnel to set up an average work cycle to pinpoint recur-
   ring periods of heavy productivity. Plotting these cycles against a time scale may reveal a pattern and
   its composite effect on the work center.

15.10. Supplementing WS with OA.
   15.10.1. During a WS study, take samples for a process previously identified for measurement by
   OA. When this occurs, keep sample accountability on the AF Form 1152, Daily Work Sampling
   Observation, but do not record samples on the AF Form 1111. Measure the process by OA on AF
   Form 1040 and transfer this time to the AF Form 308 along with the monthly-allowed man-hours from
   WS.
   15.10.2. The study team evaluates the supplemental OA for nonroutine work based on total review of
   OA work. No adjustment is needed for nonroutine work if the sampling period is considered represen-
   tative. Study teams give special instructions to identify and report cyclical work that occurs less fre-
   quently than monthly (for example, quarterly or annually). A representative sample period reduces the
   need for OA.
   15.10.3. Input team members must be cautious and realize that there is a difference between work not
   occurring during the sampling period and work not observed. If a particular step was done but was not
   observed due to the randomness of the observation schedule, do not add OA time for the step. OA
   only those nonroutine required steps that occur less frequently than monthly. Be particularly careful
   when supplementing WS data for indirect tasks. For example, preparing annual reports may be a wash
   item since daily or monthly reports normally feed into annual reports and the samples may have cap-
   tured a normal amount of time for report preparations. Study teams identify reports and meetings
   along with sampling instructions in the measurement plan. When level I sampling is being used (pro-
   ductive and nonproductive), a supplemental OA for indirect tasks is not needed.

15.11. Man-Hour Population. The man-hour population (sampled man-hours) for accounting purposes
consists of man-hours for available, nonavailable, borrowed, lunch, and overtime. It excludes loaned
man-hours. For computational purposes, the man-hour population excludes nonavailable time. This
allows for the complete accounting of time with no degradation of accuracy and percentage of occur-
rences.

15.12. Observation Schedule Development.
      15.12.1. The purpose of sampling is to supply information about the population. Characteristics dis-
      covered in the sample are expected to exist in the population from which the sample is taken. The key
      to unbiased sampling is randomness of the sample. Several methods are available to ensure random-
      ness. Two are discussed here.
         15.12.1.1. Random numbers tables. Randomly pick a starting point in a random numbers table.
         Proceed horizontally, diagonally, or vertically and record the one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit
         numbers as they appear. Disregard numbers outside the needed range. For example, if you need
         two-digit random numbers ranging from 00 through 59, then disregard the two-digit numbers
         greater than 59. If a number appears again after it has previously been recorded for use within a
         particular strata (hour or day), ignore its later appearance. This ensures consistency with sampling
         without replacement. If it takes five minutes to make an observation round, disregard numbers
         within five-minute increments of each other. Continue selecting numbers until you reach the
         desired sample size.
         15.12.1.2. Random numbers from computers. When a computer is available, get a series of num-
         bers with the needed number of digits. Treat this series the same as with the random numbers
         table.
      15.12.2. Sampling period, work center operating hours and locations, desired accuracy, and number
      of people assigned determine the number of observation rounds needed for each work center during a
      WS study. A sample is a single recorded status of one person during an observation of a work center.
      An observation yields a number of samples equal to the number of people observed. For example, an
      observation made at 1015 in a seven-man work center yields seven samples. Set up the observation
      schedule to get no fewer than 1111 available samples (excluding lunch) in each work center. This
      number ensures accuracy in all available processes and eliminates the need to estimate the number of
      samples needed when conducting a mini-study. Before sampling, consult the work center supervisor
      regarding scheduled nonavailable activities such as leave, medical absences, or TDY.
      15.12.3. Input teams determine the observation schedule. Study teams determine the cycle, the days
      to sample, and the strata to use (for example, stratified hourly or stratified daily random sampling).
      Take care when setting up the observation schedule. Taking less than 1111 samples might cause the
      study to fail statistical accuracy. If this happens, extend the measurement period through the next
      cycle. Taking too many samples may cause an excessive number of technicians to be used for mea-
      surement, thereby increasing the cost of the study.
      15.12.4. Input teams select observation times so that the number of samples taken per individual per
      day remains constant. An exception to this rule may occur when an individual is borrowed or loaned,
      works overtime, is newly assigned, or departs the work center for PCS during the duty day.
      15.12.5. When an observation schedule cannot be met because locations are widely dispersed, set up
      a randomized location schedule. A randomized location schedule is similar to a randomized time
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                           259


   schedule, however, instead of listing observation times on tickets or cards, write the title of each loca-
   tion on tickets or cards. Draw cards randomly from a hat or box, record locations in the order drawn,
   replace the cards in the box, and then repeat the draw a second, third time, etc. Next, visit each loca-
   tion in the order recorded. Begin sampling at the start of the normal duty day and continue until the
   end of the normal duty day. Move from one location to another in the order previously recorded, but
   on no prescribed schedule. Sample the location on arrival. Follow the recorded order until you have
   enough samples to achieve accuracy, a complete cycle is sampled, and the minimum sampling period
   is covered. Operationally audit overtime when this method is used.
   15.12.6. Often it is desirable to make sure each hour of the day has equal representation in the sample.
   In work centers where activity fluctuates hourly, use stratified sampling. In this procedure, determine
   the number of observations needed per hour and randomly select observations within the hour. Once
   sampling begins, input technicians must consistently follow the predetermined schedule per hour until
   completion of the sampling period. Make sure that the number of observation times for lunch are rep-
   resentative before sampling. This example illustrates how to determine the number of observations
   needed per hour.
      15.12.6.1. Assume a work center size of seven people and a sampling period of 21 work days.
      15.12.6.2. One observation of seven people per hour, assigned for an 8-hour day over a 21-day
      period, yields 1176 samples (1 x 7 x 8 x 21 = 1176). This meets the minimum requirement of 1111
      available samples. However, if normal nonavailability (13.5%) occurs during the study, then only
      86.5% of 1176 (or 1017 available samples) would be obtained. Therefore, increase the minimum
      number of observations per hour to two. Increasing the number of observations per hour above the
      minimum improves study accuracy and reduces the technicians' slack time. Make allowances for
      loaned time when setting up observation schedules.

15.13. Man-Hour Shift Profile Sampling.
   15.13.1. The purpose of the man-hour shift profile chart is to reduce standby. When minimum man-
   power is not clearly defined and it is not possible to accurately sample standby, construct a present and
   proposed man-hour shift profile chart. Use the proposed chart to support the standby time allowed in
   the standard. Also, use the chart to graphically support reduced standby to the OPR.
   15.13.2. When collecting WS data to build the man-hour shift profile chart:
      15.13.2.1. Use stratified hourly sampling.
      15.13.2.2. Designate each productive process as transferable or nontransferable.
      15.13.2.3. Construct the present man-hour shift profile chart directly from information on the
      daily observation and recapitulation sheets.
      15.13.2.4. Construct the proposed chart by analyzing and improving the present chart (Chapter 7
      tells how to construct man-hour shift profile charts).

15.14. WS Procedures.
   15.14.1. Make observations at scheduled times without distracting workers. Enter the work center as
   inconspicuously as possible. Sometimes it is best to remain in the work center between closely spaced
   observations because distractions caused by entering could bias samples.
260                                                             AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


      15.14.2. Classify the sample instantaneously so that each sample is the result of an immediate obser-
      vation. When it is not possible to identify the proper process, classify the sample as productive or non-
      productive and reconcile it later. The workers' activity immediately before or after the scheduled
      observation may give a clue to proper classification.
      15.14.3. Conduct familiarization or trial sampling to reduce the number of questions during observa-
      tion rounds. When possible, wear apparel similar to that of personnel in the work center being sam-
      pled. Likeness in clothing causes the sampling technician to blend with work center personnel and
      helps reduce apprehension due to the study. Avoid unnecessary conversation, but be friendly and
      answer questions regarding the study.
      15.14.4. Properly classify personal, rest, unavoidable delay, standby, and idle time. Accurate identifi-
      cation gives rationale for using the fixed allowance factor or for proving a larger factor that includes
      additional rest or delay. The technician should also be alert to assumed work (make work) or inferred
      work during sampling. Although the measurement plan should identify potential areas for assumed
      and inferred work, the key to proper identification is the technician's familiarity with the work center.
      Identify inferred and assumed work separately on the AF Form 1152. Later, credit inferred work to the
      proper work center or remove it from allowed man-hours. Always remove assumed work from
      allowed man-hours.
      15.14.5. Sample pre-duty and post-duty periods. The measurement technician should be in the work
      center when the first worker arrives and stay until the last worker departs. When a worker is present
      during pre-duty or post-duty periods, but is not productive, sample the worker as unscheduled (U) and
      exclude from sample man-hour computation. A productive sample during this period increases the
      number of samples per person per day and is equivalent to sampled overtime.
      15.14.6. Follow the same measurement technique for all standard input locations. For example, when
      WS is the primary measurement method, all inputs use WS. An exception is allowed when the work
      center has two or less people (see paragraph 15.4.1.). When OA is specified for one process, all inputs
      OA that process. Also, when stratified sampling is specified, all inputs stratify. When work center per-
      sonnel stagger lunch periods, use stratified, hourly sampling to make sure lunch samples are represen-
      tative.
      15.14.7. Avoid sampling at the lower task levels unless these tasks are easily identifiable by observa-
      tion. Sampling a large number of steps increases the time needed to make an observation round and
      results in a need for more sampling technicians. Sampling at the step level disrupts work center per-
      sonnel because questions need to be asked to properly classify samples.
      15.14.8. Between samples, study technicians accomplish daily accumulations, compute control chart
      limits, collect work units or potential WLFs, conduct OAs, observe personnel who might be working
      out-of-area, and investigate process improvement opportunities.
      15.14.9. Treat standby time during sampling according to Chapter 7.
      15.14.10. Study technicians should be able to recognize all the workers, their duty schedule and lunch
      period, and the work they do. Study technicians should also be familiar with the layout and boundaries
      of the work center.
      15.14.11. Record irregularities during WS in the remarks block or on the reverse side of the AF Form
      1152. These comments may explain variations that occur during measurement. List irregularities as
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                       261


   soon as practical after their occurrence. Devise coding systems to expedite sampling and facilitate
   recall. Use mutually agreed-on codes when more than one technician is involved in the study.

15.15. Daily Work Sampling Observation Form and Recapitulation Form Development.
   15.15.1. Use AF Form 1152 to record samples during observation rounds. Prepare enough forms in
   advance to accommodate the entire sampling period. Completed AF Forms 1152 and AF Forms 1157
   will be furnished to the study team if requested in the measurement plan.
   15.15.2. Procedures for preparing and completing the AF Form 1152 are standardized. The format
   allows flexibility for tailoring observations to specific work centers. For example, columns are fur-
   nished to record observation times and rows are furnished to record names or codes, ratings, and daily
   process totals. When additional columns or rows are needed, input teams may use a general-purpose
   form for recording observations. Table 15.1. tells how to prepare and complete the AF Form 1152.

   cesses by number. Place the direct process title and number (if needed) on the observation
   sheet for reference during the sampling period.

          A (pages two, three, and four), C, E, G, I, and K. The total samples should equal or exceed the
          assigned man-hours (Box 19) multiplied by the number of samples taken per hour (sampling
          rate).
  19      Assigned man-hours in blocks A (first page only), B, D, F, H, and J. Compute assigned
          man-hours by multiplying the number of hours in the normal duty day by the number of
          personnel sampled. For example, if the duty day is 8 hours plus 45 minutes for lunch, then
          multiply the number of personnel sampled by 8.75 hours.

          blocks A (pages two, three, and four), C, E, G, I, and K. Compute sampled time by multiplying
          available samples (line 15) by the relative weight of each sample. The relative weight is obtained
          for:
            a. Stratified hourly sampling: Divide "one" by the number of observation rounds per hour.
           b. Stratified daily sampling and random location sampling. Divide "eight" by the number of
         observation rounds per day.

15.16. Confidentiality of WS Data. Daily WS observation data is considered sensitive information and
is not releasable by name. These practices may be followed to maintain confidentiality.
   15.16.1. Cut out personnel names and identification on the AF Form 1152 after the samples have been
   totaled. As an alternative, black out names and make a copy.
   15.16.2. Use codes for identification in lieu of names.
   15.16.3. Devise a code for idle and sensitive processes. Use codes familiar to other technicians. Mem-
   orize codes for productive indirect and nonproductive categories and omit the legend on the form.
   15.16.4. Place a sheet of bond paper over the form while sampling.

15.17. WS Data Leveling.
   15.17.1. Pace rating is used to determine a leveling factor. The leveling factor is used to adjust pro-
   ductive time to a norm. Many processes do not lend themselves to rating, for example, supervision
   and mental work. Also, the technician must be proficient with rating and familiar with the job to rate
   effectively. The nature of selecting inputs from a cross section of installations, coupled with the stan-
   dard development process of using least squares regression, helps ensure the norm. Pace rating for WS
   studies is a study team option. If pace rating is used, the study team specifies the pace rating range in
   the measurement plan. Rate at least 25 percent of the process observations for ratable processes. If
   pace rating is not used, the leveling factor is 1.00. Procedures described in these paragraphs may be
   amplified in the measurement plan.
   15.17.2. In pace rating, the technician compares the observed pace (speed) of work done to a prede-
   termined normal pace. He or she then considers the difficulty of each step and mentally adjusts to
   allow for inherent job difficulties. Use unity (1.00) as the numerical value for the normal pace, and
   give all ratings a value in relation to 1. For example, the technician may give a rating of .95 to a certain
   observation. This rating shows that, at the time the worker was observed, he or she was doing at a
   speed five percent SLOWER than normal for the observed activity. Conversely, a rating of 1.05 shows
   the worker was doing at a speed five percent FASTER than normal.
   15.17.3. The terms pace rating and performance rating are used interchangeably in the MEP. Averag-
   ing these ratings for individual workers results in a leveling factor that is applied to productive time.
   Leveling is limited to the observed activity. In the MEP, it is used only in WS and time study.
   15.17.4. To be pace rated, the job must be repetitive and production oriented (producing an end prod-
   uct). The concept of normal pace can then be compared to a greater or lesser pace.

      15.17.5. Pace rating results in a number of separate ratings. At the end of the study, find the average
      of these ratings (leveling factor) and use this average to figure leveled time. This example shows the
      computation of a leveling factor from six separate pace rating values.


           Leveling Factor Computation
           Rating No.   Pace Rating (R)


                1        .95
                2        .90
                3        .95
                4       1.05
                5        .90
                6        .95
                 SR = 5.70


                         R = SR ÷ N = 5.70 ÷ 6 = .95



15.18. Allowance Factor Computation.
      15.18.1. Allowances are computed to recognize personal, rest, and unavoidable delay (PR&D). Use a
      fixed allowance factor when PR&D do not vary considerably between processes of work. A standard
      fixed allowance factor for personal and rest based on two 15-minute breaks per day is considered real-
      istic and liberal for most work centers. The standard fixed allowance factor is 1.067 when computed
      per paragraph 15.18.3. Additional allowance is authorized for work centers that justify additional rest
      or unavoidable delay. Furnish full justification and computation in the final report when the allowance
      factor exceeds the standard fixed allowance.
      15.18.2. Allowances are applied at the process level for WS studies. When the fixed allowance factor
      is used for the work center, apply it to all productive, leveled processes. When a larger allowance fac-
      tor is computed, apply it only to the affected process. Use the fixed allowance factor for the remaining
      productive processes. Following are two ways for determining allowance factors (in priority order):
         15.18.2.1. The study team determines whether the fixed factor is pertinent. If it isn't, the study
         team computes the allowance factor according to paragraph 15.18.3.. The allowance factor, fixed
         or computed, is evaluated during test measurement and then coordinated with the OPR. The coor-
         dinated allowance factor is then put in the measurement plan for all input locations to use. Input
         locations that do not use the allowance factor supplied by the study team must furnish full justifi-
         cation and computation for the factor used in their measurement reports.
         15.18.2.2. Input locations determine their own allowance factor and furnish rationale and compu-
         tation in their measurement reports.
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                     267


   15.18.3. Compute the allowance factor for PR&D with the equation:


    AF =    100% , where percentages are expressed in terms of
           100% - PR&D% the total workday.


   Example 1. Compute the fixed allowance factor for 30 minutes personal and rest (P&R) as follows:


    P&R = 30 min = 6.25%, where 480 equals the number of minutes
         480 min           in an 8-hour duty day, and the


    Allowance Factor =   100        = 1.067.
                         100 - 6.25


   Example 2. Compute an allowance factor when 20 additional minutes of delay per day is justified for
   one process.


    PR&D = 30 + 20 = 10.42%,
            480


    Allowance Factor =        100      = 1.116.
                           100 - 10.42



15.19. How to Complete AF Form 1111. Transfer WS results from the AF Form 1157 to the AF Form
1111. Table 15.3. has instructions on how to fill out an AF Form 1111. AF Forms 1111 sent with measure-
ment reports can be computerized, typed, or handwritten. Use continuous calculations when manually
completing the AF Form 1111. Make sure handwritten forms are neat and legible when sent in with mea-
surement reports. Study teams and input teams should always give read permissions when using comput-
erized data.

15.20. WS Data Control Charting.
      15.20.1. Types of Control Charts. The two types of control charts used with WS data are productivity
      charts and workload factor control charts.
      15.20.2. Productivity Charting.
         15.20.2.1. AF Form 1111, block 4F, shows the lower and upper control limits for the study. Visual
         inspection of this form will show days outside these limits. However, it is difficult to furnish ratio-
         nale later for a day out of control when charts are not kept on a daily basis. Recompute control
         charts after each five days and at the end of the measurement period. Plot control charts daily to
         identify days needing explanation at the end of the measurement.
         15.20.2.2. Exercise caution in discarding data. Do not declare data unusable simply because a
         point falls beyond established limits. Clearly state a reason for not using each day's data. Investi-
         gate and explain all points circled on the AF Form 1111, column 3F.
         15.20.2.3. Frequently, in the first few days (possibly a week) of sampling, a greater percentage of
         productivity is observed than in the remaining days of the study. This situation is usually caused
         by the craftsman's presence in the work center. After personnel in the work center become accus-
         tomed to the craftsman, the data is usually more representative of the normal situation. When this
         situation causes high productivity followed by low productivity, include both in the study.
         15.20.2.4. Consider alternating craftsmen daily and compare odd and even days. This will iden-
         tify any observer bias.
         15.20.2.5. Productivity charts are effective for determining representativeness of daily productiv-
         ity. By comparing productivity control charts with the workload factor control chart more infor-
         mation is apparent to the craftsman.
         15.20.2.6. A productivity chart is a graph that has a center line, upper and lower control limits
         (LCL), and the daily productivity to be analyzed.
             15.20.2.6.1. Center line. The center line is the average productivity for the period the chart
             represents.
             15.20.2.6.2. Control limits. Set upper and lower control limits by adding and subtracting three
             standard errors of proportion from the center line.
         15.20.2.7. The same general procedures for preparing control charts (Table 15.4.) apply to all
         types of control charts. However, the computations of the needed values differ for variable data
         (measurements of time, length, etc.) and attribute data (percents or proportions). WS uses attribute
         data.
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                              271


Table 15.4. Preparation Of A Control Chart.
  Step     Action
   1       Clearly label both vertical and horizontal axes to indicate what is being charted.
   2       Scale the vertical axis to include the range of values to be charted.
   3       Indicate with a broken line when an axis does not go all the way to zero.
   4        Extend the horizontal axis to allow all of the data to be charted (both current data and data to
           be obtained in the future).
   5       Draw a solid line to indicate the center line. Identify the value.
   6       Place dotted lines for the upper (UCL) and lower (LCL) control limits. Indicate the value of
           each.
   7       Plot the points to be evaluated on the control chart.
   8       Connect all of the points to aid the visual analysis by using a solid line between each of the
           points or by using a vertical line between each point on the X-axis.




         15.20.2.8. Attribute data is suitable for a P-chart that evaluates changes in the percent or propor-
         tion. The P-chart is based on the binomial distribution. This distribution uses the average quantity
         in computing its variation. The instructions for the needed values are in Table 15.5..

      15.20.3. Workload Factor Control Charting.
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                         273


     15.20.3.1. The workload factor control chart is used in combination with productivity charts.
     Make a workload factor control chart when the workload factor count is available on a daily basis.
     15.20.3.2. A workload factor control chart often helps determine the representativeness of the
     study period, verify the accuracy of the work count, and identify normal workloads. Development
     of a work center standard during other than normal workload periods might result in a distortion of
     the standard. Prepare the chart as follows:
        15.20.3.2.1. Get the historical workload (6 to 12 months). Then compute the average daily
        historical workload by dividing the total workload for the period by the number of months
        included and then dividing the quotient by the average number of days the work center works
        each month.
        15.20.3.2.2. Draw the chart on standard graph paper with days as the horizontal axis and
        workload as the vertical axis. The range of days will be determined by the number of days you
        wish to analyze (usually the entire study period). The range of workload will be from zero to
        the maximum total workload expected (add 10% for error).
        15.20.3.2.3. Multiply the average daily historical workload by the number of study days
        intended, then plot the product on the vertical axis. The corresponding horizontal coordinate is
        the last date to be studied. Connect this point and the origin with a solid straight line. This line
        is the historical average workload line.
        15.20.3.2.4. As the study develops, plot each day's workload factor count cumulatively.
        15.20.3.2.5. The shape of the daily plot shows the work pattern. When cycles end near the his-
        torical average workload line, the work center is working at the average workload volume.
        15.20.3.2.6. Valuable questions in analyzing points that deviate from the historical line
        include: Are the daily and historical counts based on the same workload factor? Check the def-
        inition of the workload factor. Is a regular cycle appearing? Plan to stop sampling as close as
        possible to the completion of a cycle. Is productivity commensurate with high or low current
        workload compared to historical workload? Check rating factors for indications of high or low
        ratings. Is the unit experiencing an activity (exercise or operational test) that affects the work-
        load count? Is it affecting productivity? Check the P-chart to determine whether days should
        be excluded from the study.
        15.20.3.2.7. Figure 15.1. shows an example of a workload factor control chart and the data
        used to prepare it.

   15.20.4. Interpretation of Control Charts.
      15.20.4.1. Control charts are used in the MEP to determine whether or not a single population is
      represented.
      15.20.4.2. If a control chart is stable, the measurements are considered to be from the same popu-
      lation. Then use the average value to describe this population. A control chart is considered stable
      if these conditions exist:
          15.20.4.2.1. All points are scattered evenly on both sides of the center line and no points are
          outside the three standard deviation control limits.
          15.20.4.2.2. Most points tend to cluster around the center line.
          15.20.4.2.3. Relatively few points are near the control limits.
          15.20.4.2.4. There are no runs of seven or more consecutive points on the same side of the
          center line.
      15.20.4.3. When any of the rules for stability are violated, further investigation is needed. Suitable
      responses are needed for the instability. The value can be used, omitted, or corrected. Document
      all decisions of this type. Some possible reasons for instability are:
          15.20.4.3.1. An error in the data.
          15.20.4.3.2. A different situation or population was measured.
          15.20.4.3.3. Additional work was included or excluded in the data.
          15.20.4.3.4. High or low productivity.

15.21. Types of WS Studies.
   15.21.1. Level of Studies. Design WS studies to measure work as productive and nonproductive
   (level I) or at the process level (level II).
   15.21.2. Level I Studies.
      15.21.2.1. In Level I studies, samples are broadly classified as productive, nonproductive, non-
      available, and lunch. Sample nonproductive categories such as personal, rest, delay, and idle at the
      category level since they are easily discernible. This supplies information to support the allowance
      factor and to brief the OPR.
      15.21.2.2. Use percentage estimates to distribute productive time (direct and indirect) into pro-
      cesses. Derive these percentage estimates through consultation with key personnel and the work
      center supervisor. Get estimates from several work center personnel to improve the reliability of
      process distribution. Percentage estimates must equal 100%. Figure 15.2. shows an example of
      estimated process distribution percentages. It assumes that estimates were obtained from the work
      center supervisor (estimate A) and the foreman (estimate B). The "percent of total" column (col-
      umn five) is used to distribute the productive direct time into processes.

      15.21.3. Level II Studies.
         15.21.3.1. Level II studies are measured at the process level. In most WS studies, it is easy to dis-
         tinguish between productive and nonproductive samples. The distinction between productive
         direct and productive indirect is more difficult. For example, the productive direct process of man-
         agement is similar to the productive indirect processes of supervision and administration when
         observed at the task level of accomplishment. If a sample is misclassified as direct when it is really
         indirect, there is no change to total productive time.
         15.21.3.2. Because measured indirect time is based on observations, do not use SIAMs with WS
         studies. Do not compromise standard studies based on observation by comparing their economics
         with the economics for standard studies based on nonmeasurement methods.
             15.21.3.2.1. Productive direct time is sampled at Level I and prorated by percentages to get
             direct process and indirect category time, and
             15.21.3.2.2. Productive indirect time is sampled at Level II (category level).

                                             QUEUEING

16.1. General Concepts.
   16.1.1. A queue is defined as a waiting line. Queue analysis involves a mathematical study of waiting
   lines.
   16.1.2. A queueing system refers to the entire process of a customer arriving, being served, and leav-
   ing. Figure 16.1. illustrates the basic steps of a queueing system.

Figure 16.1. General Flow of a Queueing System.




   16.1.3. A specific definition is needed to understand the term customer. It is used in a general sense
   and does not necessarily refer to a human customer. A customer could be:
      16.1.3.1. An airplane waiting to be refueled.
      16.1.3.2. A computer program waiting to be run.
      16.1.3.3. A ball bearing waiting to be inspected.
   16.1.4. Traditional work measurement techniques apply to a situation where the next item to be pro-
   cessed is available when the worker is ready to start. In situations where workload develops randomly,
   queueing theory applies. Examples of such areas are:
      16.1.4.1. Checkout cashiers in the commissary.
      16.1.4.2. Forklift truck operators.
      16.1.4.3. Personnel who check out records such as in a hospital or Military Personnel Flight
      (MPF)
      16.1.4.4. Tool crib attendants.
      16.1.4.5. Clerks who set up telephone appointments.
      16.1.4.6. Drivers for the base taxi service.
      16.1.4.7. Inventory items in a warehouse.
278                                                              AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


      16.1.5. A queueing model does not make decisions. It provides information to base decisions on. It
      can tell you the probability of waiting or not waiting. It can also determine the average number of
      units to be served and the average time spent in the queue. Given any of these as the selection criteria,
      you can decide what level of performance is acceptable. For example, you can determine the number
      of cashiers needed to make sure a desired average waiting time. On the other hand, you can measure
      an arrival rate to setup an appointment system.
      16.1.6. The primary intent of this chapter is to relate queueing analysis to the MEP. General proce-
      dures are presented to give direction to the analysis and a feel for queueing situations. Due to the com-
      plexity of the subject matter, the specific details are omitted and textbooks are referenced at the end of
      this chapter. A team desiring to use this method should either have a person on the team who knows
      queueing theory or seek advice from such a person.

16.2. Information Needed.
      16.2.1. Queueing Analysis. Before doing any queueing analysis carefully study the entire queueing
      system. Figure 16.2. presents the type of information needed to do a queueing study.

Figure 16.2. Types of Information Needed in Queueing.




      16.2.2. Customer Population. The size of the customer population (either finite or infinite) is basically
      a count of the actual population. A customer population that is fixed in size is finite. However, when
      a finite population is large enough not to be affected by the service capacity of the system, then the
      population is essentially infinite. Most queueing systems have finite customer populations and are
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                         279


  correctly assumed to be infinite. Unless the population is infinite (or can be assumed to be infinite),
  the probability of a customer arriving for service changes is based on the number of customers already
  in the system. For example:
     16.2.2.1. Consider repairing lathes. The machine shop has five lathes (customer population equals
     five). These machines break down occasionally (arrive for service). Two repairmen (servers) are
     assigned to that shop. The down machine will be repaired and put back in service. This is consid-
     ered a finite source. While one machine is down, the customer population is not the same (only
     four remain in service).
     16.2.2.2. A Similar Machine. Now assume a similar machine shop has included a sufficient num-
     ber of spare machines. When one machine is down, a spare is immediately substituted. Hence, the
     customer population is constant at five, even if one is down.
     16.2.2.3. Next, consider a commissary. The customer population is finite because only people
     with commissary privileges are customers. However, this population is large when compared to
     the service capacity of the commissary. In effect, it is inexhaustible (infinitely large).
  16.2.3. Number of Service Channels.
     16.2.3.1. Service channels are concerned not only with the number of service facilities but also
     with the associated queues. A queue is characterized by the maximum number of customers it can
     hold. When a given number of customers are waiting in a queue, future customers are denied entry
     into the queue until others are served. This is a finite queue. An infinite queue does not have such
     restrictions.
     16.2.3.2. A single service channel usually has only one queue or waiting line.
     16.2.3.3. Multiple service channels can have one queue, such as a barbershop with multiple bar-
     bers and a general waiting area where customers are served on a first-come, first-served basis.
     16.2.3.4. Multiple service channels can also each be served by a different queue, such as a super-
     market with several checkers.
  16.2.4. Queue Discipline.
     16.2.4.1. This refers to the method that customers are selected from the queue to be served. Some
     of the common disciplines are:
         16.2.4.1.1. First-come, first-served. The next available server services the first customer in the
         queue line.
         16.2.4.1.2. Priority. A customer is given some sort of priority on entering the queue. Those
         with higher priorities are served before those with lower priorities. Two types of priority are
         preemptive and head-of-line. Preemptive priority is when a customer with high priority is
         allowed to enter the service channel immediately even if a customer with a lower priority is
         being serviced. Head-of-line priority puts a higher priority customer at the head of the line, but
         does not preempt any ongoing service.
         16.2.4.1.3. Random selection. Selection is independent of arrival time.
         16.2.4.1.4. Bulk selection. A group of customers are selected at one time.
280                                                            AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003


         16.2.4.2. Queue disciplines alter when customers do not behave as expected. Two examples are
         when a customer jumps from one channel to another and when a customer balks (turns around and
         leaves instead of waiting in line for service).
      16.2.5. Arrival and Service Patterns.
         16.2.5.1. The arrival pattern of customers to a queueing system can be described by one of these.
             16.2.5.1.1. The average number of arrivals to the system per some unit of time (mean arrival
             rate).
             16.2.5.1.2. The average time between successive arrivals (mean interarrival time).
         16.2.5.2. The service pattern of customers within a nonempty queueing system can be described
         by:
             16.2.5.2.1. The average number of customers served per some unit of time (mean service
             rate).
             16.2.5.2.2. The average time to service a customer (mean service time).
         16.2.5.3. Similarities and relationships exist between these two types of distinct patterns. Study
         both patterns in depth to adequately describe a queueing system.
         16.2.5.4. The random occurrences within each of these patterns will follow a particular statistical
         distribution. The identification of the distribution may or may not be straightforward. In favorable
         situations, when the arrival rates follow a Poisson distribution and the service time follows an
         exponential distribution, straightforward queueing formulas can be used. Knowing, recognizing,
         and using these distributions involve mathematical sophistication that is beyond the scope of this
         chapter. A general example is provided in the remainder of this chapter to illustrate the flow of one
         queueing analysis without detailing all of the mathematical steps.

16.3. Collecting Information.
      16.3.1. In queueing analysis, the information collected can be categorized in two broad categories -
      general information and numerical information.
      16.3.2. General information comes from an in-depth look at the queueing system that includes evalu-
      ating the customer population limit, the queue discipline used, and the number of parallel service
      channels. This type of information appears easy to obtain, but a careful study of the situation may
      uncover some subtle differences embedded in the system. For example, recall the comments in the
      previous paragraph about infinite versus finite customer populations.
      16.3.3. Numerical information is a general grouping that includes collecting and analyzing the distri-
      bution of service times, arrivals, and times between arrivals. Needed numerical data are the exact
      times that customers arrive at a system for service and the actual service times. The method of collect-
      ing this data (either through measurement or from historical files) depends on the availability of data
      and the type of standard to be built.
         16.3.3.1. Historical data, such as dispatch logs and job-supervisors records, may provide the
         needed information. Verify the data for accuracy and representativeness. For example, does the
         service time include standby time?
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                               281


       16.3.3.2. Measurement is the most common source of data. Design a procedure for gathering this
       data for both the service time and the arrival rate (or interarrival time) for the particular work cen-
       ter being studied. One of several methods or a combination of methods may be used.
           16.3.3.2.1. Use a stopwatch to measure the amount of time needed to give service. Time only
           the actual time spent giving service, from the second it starts to the second it finishes.
           16.3.3.2.2. Use a log to show the exact time a customer arrives for service. Compute the
           arrival rates from such a log by counting how many customers arrived in a given block of time
           (e.g., per each 10 minutes).
           16.3.3.2.3. Use a log to record when service begins and ends. An example could be a dispatch-
           ing log used at a base taxi service.
           16.3.3.2.4. There are many other methods that may be more suitable for the situation being
           studied. Remember, the quality of this input data is extremely important because it will form
           the basis for analysis.
   16.3.4. Consider a tool crib as the setting of a queueing analysis. It is decided to obtain information
   about the arrivals of mechanics at the tool crib by using a log to account for the number of arrivals per
   each 10 minutes. Information about the time it takes an attendant to wait on a mechanic is obtained
   with actual timings.

16.4. Evaluating Data.
   16.4.1. Analyze information about arrival and service data separately, but the procedures are the same
   in both cases.
   16.4.2. Arrange and organize the data in a frequency table. This will prepare the data for the chi
   square goodness-of-fit test. Make sure the number of categories in the frequency table reflect the situ-
   ation (for example, when talking about the number of arrivals per block of time, begin with 0 arrivals,
   l arrival, etc.). Usually between 8 and 20 categories are sufficient.
   16.4.3. Construct a histogram of the data to provide a visual method for estimating how well this data
   is exhibiting the properties of the desired distribution.
   16.4.4. Do the chi square goodness-of-fit test to determine whether the data can be considered from
   the desired probability distribution. Group some of the categories together to make sure the expected
   frequency in each cell is at least 5. Find the details of this test in the references listed at the end of this
   chapter.
       16.4.4.1. If the data passes the goodness-of-fit test, use the mean time from this data in further
       analysis.
       16.4.4.2. If the data does not pass this test, do one of the following steps:
           16.4.4.2.1. Reevaluate the data (collection method, accuracy, and representativeness of the

      rates follow a Poisson distribution (Figure 16.3.). The data passes the test and we conclude that the
      arrival distribution is Poisson. The average value for the arrival rate (l ) can then be used in further
      analysis:


       l = 16.04 arrivals per ten minutes or


       l = 96.24 arrivals per hour

      16.4.7. The service times for this example are tested to determine if they follow an exponential distri-
      bution. The details of this analysis are not presented in this chapter. For this example, assume it passes
      the test for an exponential distribution. Since the average service time is determined to be .7496 min-
      utes per customer, the average service rate is the reciprocal of .7496 or:


             m = 1.334 customers per minute
              m = 80.04 customers per hour


      16.4.8. The utilization factor (r) for a queueing system is defined as the mean arrival rate (l) divided
      by the service capacity of the system. The service capacity of the system is the mean service rate (m)
      times the number of service channels (c) in the system. Hence, r= l/cm The utilization factor repre-
      sents the proportion of the total service capacity needed to service the customers. If r> 1 , then the
      customers are arriving at a faster rate than they can be served, and queues will build indefinitely. In
      such a situation, either l, c, or m must be changed to get r< 1. For example, more servers (increase c)
      can be added to meet the needs of the system, or labor-efficient equipment can be incorporated to
      serve more per unit time (increase m).
      16.4.9. The utilization factor for the tool crib when it is operated with only one attendant (c = l) is
      greater than one:
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                         285


                l   96.24
        (r=    cm = 80.04 = l.2024).


Therefore, the mechanics will always have to wait since one attendant is not able to wait on them fast
enough. Hence, more than one attendant is needed.



16.5. Combining Information.
   16.5.1. After the service times and arrival rates have been identified as coming from a relevant distri-
   bution, this numerical information can be joined with the general information already obtained.
   16.5.2. See Figure 16.5. for a simplistic picture that relates common queueing terms to the general
   queueing system.

      16.6.), the formulas in that figure apply.

Figure 16.6. Queueing Formulas.
MAJOR ASSUMPTIONS:

 1. The arrival rate follows a Poisson distribution.
 2. The service time follows an exponential distribution.
 3. The system is considered to be a "steady state" system. This is an ongoing system instead
    of one that is just starting up (in transition).
 4. The queue discipline used is "first-come-first-served."

DEFINITIONS:

 l   (Lamda) Average rate per unit of time at which customers arrive at the queueing system
    (e.g., 6 per hour).*
 m (Mu) Average rate per unit of time at which each service channel provided service (e.g., 1
    per minute or 60 per hour).*
 c Number of service channels in the queueing system.
 r (Rho) Utilization factor defined as:        r= l
                                                   cm
 W Mean time in system; average amount of time one customer spends in the queueing system
    (waiting and being served).
 Wq Mean time in queue; average amount of time one customer spends in the queue (waiting
    only).
 L Mean line length; average number of customers in the queueing system (waiting and being
    served).
 Lq Mean queue length; average number of customers in the queue (waiting only).
 Po Probability of no one being in the queueing system at a given point in time (to be used in
    computations).
 * Remember: Units of time must be the same for all computations.
 FORMULA (for use when the above assumptions are met):


                                              W = Wq + 1/m


                                               Lq = Wql

                                               L = Wl

      16.5.4. When different queueing systems are identified, obtain the needed formulas from a queueing
      textbook.

16.6. Average Costs of Various Systems.
      16.6.1. A queue will form any time a customer arrives for service and all of the servers are busy. More
      servers can be added to eliminate the queueing problem. Since customers arrive at random times, each
      additional server will also result in an increase in idle time. This will increase the operational costs.
      16.6.2. The total cost of a system can be viewed as the cost of service and the cost of waiting. Figure
      16.7. shows that as the level of service is increased (for example, adding more service channels), the
      cost of providing the service also increases. However, as the level of service is increased, customers
      do not have to wait as long for service and the cost of waiting decreases. The curve of the total cost
      starts out decreasing. This shows that adding more servers cuts waiting time enough to lower the total
      cost. However, the total cost curve reaches its minimum and then increases. This shows additional
      servers after that point are a waste of money. Note that the minimum total cost does not have to occur
      at the intersection of waiting and service costs.

Figure 16.7. Cost Model.




         16.6.2.1. The cost of service is normally found by multiplying the number of servers by their sal-
         ary rate. For example, if three servers are needed and each is paid $3.50 per hour, the cost of ser-
         vice is 3 times $3.50 or $10.50 per hour.
         16.6.2.2. The cost of waiting may often be difficult to compute. We must recognize that there are
         different types of costs involved in waiting.
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                         289


         16.6.2.2.1. For example, what is the cost of an aircraft waiting to be loaded during an emer-
         gency? While we may not be able to quantify this type of cost, other costs of waiting can be
         quantified.
         16.6.2.2.2. There is the obvious cost of the salary paid to the person standing in line, waiting
         for service. This person is idle (not being productive), thus creating a waiting cost.
         16.6.2.2.3. Similarly, an aircraft in a holding pattern is using extra fuel while waiting to land.
         Also, if several people work with a machine that breaks down, they are idle until the machine
         is repaired.
         16.6.2.2.4. Finally, there are intangible costs such as decreased morale because a person had
         to wait too long for service at the Military Personnel Flight (MPF) or gymnasium. A customer
         may refuse to wait and leave the system.
  16.6.3. When arrival and service rates can be held constant, the number of service channels can be
  varied to see their effect on the number of customers waiting for service and on the average waiting
  time. In this situation, the total cost of alternate systems can be compared.
  16.6.4. Because the major assumptions have been met for our tool crib example, use the straightfor-
  ward formulas in Figure 16.6.. It has already been determined that one attendant at the tool crib can-
  not meet the needs of the mechanics. Would two attendants be enough? Three? Four?
     16.6.4.1. In our example, to compute the cost of waiting, we need two additional values: the aver-
     age number of mechanics waiting and the average amount of time each waits. ("In the system"
     refers to both waiting in the queue and being served.) Calculate these two values separately for sit-
     uations where there are two, three, and four servers. Figure 16.8. shows step-by-step calculations
     for three servers. It also shows the average times for two, three, and four servers.

      16.6.4.2. When this information is combined, make an economical decision about the number of
      attendants (or servers) to use, given that the service rate and arrival rate do not change. See Figure
      16.9. for this comparison. This figure shows that three attendants provide the most efficient oper-
      ation.

16.7. Uses of Queueing Analysis.
    16.7.1. Manpower Standards. Use queueing analysis to determine the number of requirements
    allowed by a manpower standard when the acceptable level of service is known.
    16.7.2. Management Consultant Studies. In management consultant studies, the main thrust of a
    queueing study is directed more toward improving the productivity rather than determining manpower
    requirements. Queueing analysis can provide the potential improvement results of changing the aver-
    age service times or the number of servers.

available during that period. Examples of standby time are: an emergency room medical technician
awaiting patients; a commissary ID checker awaiting customers to enter the checkout line; a taxi driver
awaiting passengers at a dispatch office; and a passenger processing specialist awaiting aircraft arrival.
Straightlining—A way to forecast future workload that assumes that there will be no change in workload
from what has occurred in the past.
Stratified Random Times—Random times selected to provide equal number of observations for each
specified time period, such as four random times per hour.
Systems Analysis—Investigating a system of operation in an organization from supplier to customer.
Then developing a new system incorporating the viable ideas of all workers in the system with the intent
of improving service to the customer.
Task List—A clear and complete description of the actions or duties of an individual.
Technical Estimate—A determination of the standard hours required for a given task, based on an
estimate by individuals who are technically and professionally competent to judge the time required.
Time Study—A work measurement method consisting of careful time measurement of the task with a
time measuring instrument. The study is adjusted for any observed variances from normal effort to pace.
It allows adequate time for unavoidable or machine delays, rest to overcome fatigue, and personal needs.
Learning or progress effects may also be considered. If the task is long, it is normally broken down into
short, relatively homogeneous work elements, each of which is treated separately by, and in combination
with, the rest.
Transferable Work—Work that is essential to the work center, but may be done at any time or during
any period. It may be direct or indirect type of work.
Transient Time—Time associated with travel and leave in conjunction with a PCS move. Manpower
authorizations to offset this loss are provided for in the transient or individual's account and are not
contained in the MAJCOM UAF.
Unavoidable Delay—An occurrence that is essential and outside the worker's control or responsibility
that prevents the accomplishment of productive work.
Unavoidable Delay Allowance—See Delay Allowance.
Unit Manpower Document (UMD)—A detailed manpower listing reflecting the distribution of
manpower allocations into a finite structure of authorizations (by work center).
Variance—A condition that exists that either adds to or subtracts from the core workload, or impacts the

way the work is performed. A variance can be the result of environmental, mission or technological
differences, and can be either negative or positive.
   1. Environmental Variance. Accounts for different operating conditions from those used to
      develop the core manpower standard (e.g., snow, geographical separation, etc.). It can either
      increase (positive) or decrease (negative) requirements.
   2. Mission Variance. Accounts for different operating processes from those used to develop the
      core manpower requirements. It can either increase (positive) or decrease (negative) require-
      ments.
   3. Technological Variance. Accounts for different operating equipment from those used to develop
      the core manpower requirements. It can either increase (positive) or decrease (negative) require-
      ments.
Variation—A measure of the dispersion or scattering of values about the mean of a distribution.
Work Center—A group of personnel that use similar machines, processes, methods, and operations to do
homogeneous work usually located in a centralized area. The term is used to identify a relatively small
activity within a broad functional segment. Personnel within a work center do work that basically
contributes to the same end product or result (duties are similar or closely related).
Work Count—The number of work units done during a specified time period.
Work Cycle—
   1. A pattern or sequence of tasks, operations, or processes with a distinct beginning and ending
      point.
   2. A pattern of manual motions, elements, activities, or operations that are repeated without signifi-
      cant variation each time a unit of work is completed.
Work Distribution Analysis—A technique to improve production that helps find out what work is being
done, how much time is spent on it, and who is doing it.
Work Flow—The flow or movement of things being processed from one operation to another.
Work Measurement—Process to obtain data necessary to compute accurate manpower requirements.
Techniques include work sampling, time study, and good operator timing and technical estimate. Usually
results in a manpower standard or guide.
Work Sampling—The application of statistical sampling theory and techniques to the study of work
systems. The characteristics of the sampled (observed) work done are used to produce estimates of the
amounts of work and types of activity done. Work sampling data can be used in conjunction with
associated work counts to compute standards.
Work Unit—The basic identification of work accomplished or services performed. Work units should be
easy to identify; convenient for obtaining productive count; and usable for scheduling, planning, and
costing. Syn: Workload Factor.
Workload—An expression of the amount of work, identified by the number of work units or volume of a
workload factor, that a work center has on hand at any given time or is responsible for doing during a
specified period of time.

Workload Factor (WLF)—
      1. An index or unit of measure that is consistently expressive of, or relatable to, the manpower
         required to accomplish the quantitatively and qualitatively defined responsibilities of a work cen-
         ter.
      2. An end product (or a combination of products) that represents the work done in the work center. It
         may be either something physically produced in the work center (referred to as a production-type
         WLF) or something that is external to, but served by, the work center (referred to as a work gener-
         ator-type WLF).

Critical Values (F*) for the F-test
- Two Tables are contained here. One is for 90% confidence (Table A2.1.) and the other for 95% confi-
dence (Table A2.2.).
- This test is primarily used for the MEP to decide if a regression equation explains a significant amount
of the variation.
Critical Values (t*) for the t-test.
- This test is used in regression analysis to determine if an individual variable contributes significantly to
the overall equation.
- When the sample size (n) gets very large (¥), the values on the t-Table become the same as the values
found on a normal Z-Table. Therefore, values in this t-Table corresponding with df = ¥ can be used for the
Z values when n > 30.

Table A2.1. Critical Values For The F-Test.
Definitions:

  1. df1 = degrees of freedom for the numerator (m - 1 )*

  2. df2 = degrees of freedom for the denominator (n - m)*

  3. (1 - a)% = per cent of confidence in the results of this test

  * From regression analysis, m is the number of regression coefficients estimated and n is
the number of data sets.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS


This change incorporates interim change (IC) 03-1, which operationalizes three new indirect man-hour
measurement methods. Paragraphs 13.5 through 13.8.5.2 are all new paragraphs to Chapter 13, STAN-
DARD INDIRECT ALLOWED MAN-HOURS (SIAM).
13.5. Alternate Indirect Man-Hour Measurement Methods:
13.5.1. In addition to the SIAM, several other standard indirect measurement methods are available to
provide flexibility in responding to the dynamic expeditionary nature of our aerospace forces. These tools
include the Standard Indirect Allowed Man-Hour Equation (SIAME), Direct and Indirect Manpower
Equation (DIME) and the Capabilities Based Manpower Determinant (CBMD) Standard Indirect Allow-
ance Factor (SIAF).
13.5.1.1. The Air Force is transforming to a capabilities-focused Expeditionary Air and Space Force. In
doing so, our goal is to make warfighting effects, and the capabilities we need to achieve them, the drivers
for everything we do. In addressing this Air Force goal, we define manpower requirements in an environ-
ment of global engagement with expeditionary forces performing capabilities. We call this manpower
quantification the CBMD.
13.5.1.2. The CBMD SIAF is designed to address indirect man-hours or indirect fractional manning when
computing a CBMD manpower requirement. The DIME is designed to address indirect man-hours or
fractional manning when combining all CBMDs for a determination of manpower requirements at the
organizational level or function.
13.5.2. Each tool is discussed in detail in the following paragraphs. Table 13.1, Standard Indirect Mea-
surement Tools Decision Logic Table, describes the advantages and disadvantages of each tool and when
they are recommended for use.

13.6. Standard Indirect Allowed Man-Hour Equation (SIAME)
13.6.1. The SIAME is an alternate method of crediting indirect man-hours for Operational Audit and
Time Study standards. Direct and SIAME man-hours are added to determine total monthly man-hours for
work centers of five or more assigned personnel.
13.6.2. The SIAME was developed using the FAC family approach. Functional areas were analyzed by
reviewing the primary mission, types of specialties used, and organizational levels within the function.
Associated FACs were then grouped into SIAME families using the following definitions:

13.6.2.1. Management and Administration Work Centers. These work centers have the primary function
of managing subordinate organizational elements and providing unit administrative support. Examples
include the medical support squadron’s personnel and administration flight, the civil engineer unit admin-
istration and the operations squadron’s operations officer and the maintenance officer.
13.6.2.2. Production and Staff Support Work Centers. These work centers have the primary function of
supporting the production area of an organization and researching, evaluating, reporting, coordinating,
and advising. Examples include the wing manpower and organization office, the comptroller squadron
financial analysis flight, the civil engineering or services squadron’s resource management flights and the
medical support squadron’s medical information services flight.
13.6.2.3. Customer Service Work Centers. These work centers have the primary function of providing
specific services to customers. Examples include the military and civilian personnel flights, base billeting,
military pay and travel.
13.6.2.4. Medical Work Centers. These work centers include medical facilities and dental services.
13.6.2.5. Warehouse, Storage, and Issue. These work centers have the primary function of receiving, stor-
ing, or issuing material. Examples include the supply squadron material storage and distribution flight and
fuels management flight.
13.6.2.6. Industrial Shop. These work centers have the primary function of testing, overhauling, repairing,
or manufacturing specific products. Examples include aerospace ground equipment and vehicle mainte-
nance.

13.6.2.8. Table 13.3 complements Tables 13.2, 13.4 and 13.5. It reflects the SIAME, DIME and SIAF
Family for each specific FAC. Tables 13.2, 13.4 and 13.5 are summaries of SIAME, DIME and SIAF
models by general FAC family. The study team identifies the family on table 13.3 and uses the indicated
equation or factor specified on Tables 13.2, 13.3 or 13.5. For example, Table 13.3 reflects Production and
Staff Support for the Manpower function. Table 13.2 states the SIAME model to use is Y(SIAME) = 176.90
+ 10.4032X, Table 13.4 states the DIME model to use is Y(DIME) = 1.88 + 1.0785X, and Table 13.5 states
the SIAF factor to use is 1.0785.

13.6.3.4. Application. The standards development team develops a direct manpower equation, Y(Dir),
using measured direct time and an indirect equation, Y (SIAME), using the selected SIAME and the average
number of assigned work center personnel as the workload factor. The direct equation results are added to
the SIAME results to derive the total monthly man-hours.
13.6.3.4.1. Application Example: Using a notional Y(Dir) = 300 + 5.6555X equation,
       Y(Dir) = 300 + 5.6555X (Where X(Dir) = Workload Factor = 250 Vehicles Assigned).
       Y(Dir) = 300 + 5.6555(250) = 1713.88.
       Y (SIAME) = 270.13 + 9.3033X (X(SIAME) = 12 Average Assigned Personnel).
       Y (SIAME) = 270.13 + 9.3033 (12) = 381.77 Indirect Man-Hours
       Y(Tot) = Y (DIR) + Y (SIAME) = Y (Tot)
       Y(Tot) = 1713.88 + 381.77 = 2095.65 Total Man-Hours
13.6.4. Using SIAME:
13.6.4.1. The study team must use caution when selecting the SIAME. Review the FAC family definitions
in paragraphs 13.6.2.1 through 13.6.2.6 and select the SIAME that best fits the work center or function
being studied. Ensure the standard indirect description reflected in AFMS00AA applies. If ANY of the
indirect task definition elements are not done, or additional elements are done, a variance must be devel-
oped to supplement the SIAME. In this case, you must measure this task using the SIAM task measure-
ment instructions reflected on the SIAM task data sheet. These measured man-hours are then added or
subtracted, as appropriate, from the results of the SIAME application.
13.6.4.2. Use logic. If the SIAME allowed time is not representative of what normally occurs in the work
center the study team should measure the task using the SIAM task data sheet measurement instructions.
13.7. Direct & Indirect Manpower Equation (DIME)
13.7.1. The DIME is an alternate method of crediting indirect manpower for functions of five or more
assigned personnel that has quantified total direct manpower requirements.
13.7.2. Table 13.4, Air Force DIME Families, reflects the DIME model for each FAC family.

        NOTES:
        1. Y(DIME) results in total (direct & indirect) manpower.
        2. X = Direct Manpower
        3. Recommended for work centers of five or more assigned personnel.


13.7.1.6. Table 13.3, SIAME, DIME, & SIAF Listing by FAC, reflects the DIME for each individual
FAC.
13.7.2. Terms and Symbols
13.7.2.1. Y(Dir) = Direct manpower from application of a manpower equation and subsequent conversion
to a manpower requirement by applying the applicable MAF.
13.7.2.2. Y(DIME) = Total manpower requirement by applying the direct manpower (Y(Dir)) in the applica-
ble DIME.
13.7.2.3. Application. Prior to using the DIME model it is necessary to quantify the total functional direct
manpower (Y(DIR)). This is accomplished by determining the total direct required monthly man-hours for
the function and dividing by the appropriate MAF. The study team selects the appropriate DIME
(Y(DIME)) model (See Table 13.3 ) and applies direct manpower as the independent variable. The DIME
produces the total direct and indirect manpower.
13.7.2.4. Application Example: Using a notional Y(Dir) = 300 + 5.6555X equation,
       Y(Dir) = 300 + 5.6555X (Where X(Dir) = Workload Factor = 250 Vehicles Assigned).
       Y(Dir) = 300 + 5.6555(250) = 1713.88 Direct Man-Hours.
       1713.88/149.6 = 11.46 Direct Manpower
       Y (DIME) = 1.81 + 1.0681X (Where X = Direct Manpower).
       Y (DIME) = 1.81 + 1.0681 (11.46) = 14.05 Total Functional Manpower Requirement.

oped to supplement the DIME. In this case, you must measure this task using the SIAM Task Measure-
ment Instructions reflected on the SIAM Task Data Sheet. These measured man-hours are then added or
subtracted, as appropriate, from the results of the DIME application.
13.7.3.2. Use logic. If the DIME allowed manpower is not representative of what normally occurs in the
function the study team should consider an alternate model.
13.8. Capability Based Manpower Determinant (CBMD) Standard Indirect Allowance Factor
(SIAF).
13.8.1. The CBMD SIAF is a simple tool that quantifies the incremental indirect man-hours required for
each CBMD resource (i.e., Security Forces, Personnel, Medical, etc.).
13.8.2. Table 13.5, Air Force CBMD SIAF Families, reflects the SIAF for each FAC family.

       NOTES:
       1. Multiply the SIAF by the CBMD Direct Man-hours and divide by the applicable
          MAF to compute the CBMD FTEs.

           OR
       2. Multiply the CBMD Direct FTE by the SIAF to compute the total CBMD FTE.

           OR
       3. Multiply the SIAF by the regression coefficients of the CBMD Y(CBMD DIR) equa-
          tion (if available). For example: Y(CBMD DIR) = a + bX, Y(CBMD Total) = a (SIAF) +
          b(SIAF)X. X = CBMD specific workload factor.

13.8.4.1. CBMD Direct Man-hours = Direct man-hours for each CBMD.
13.8.4.2. SIAF = Standard Indirect Allowance Factor.
13.8.4.3. Application. Application of the SIAF results in the total monthly man-hour requirement which
may be converted to a full time equivalent (FTE) by dividing the man-hours by the applicable man-hour
availability factor (MAF). The study team selects the appropriate SIAF and applies it to the respective
direct man-hours.
13.8.4.4. Application Example: The study team selects the appropriate CBMD SIAF (i.e. Security Forces
= SIAF 1.0785, Military Personnel Flight = 1.0610, Emergency Room = SIAF 1.0699) and multiplies it
times the CBMD Direct Man-hours, if available. This value is divided by the appropriate MAF to deter-
mine the FTE. Sum all FTEs to determine the CBMD total FTE requirement. If the CBMD Direct FTE
has been defined, the study team multiplies this value by the respective SIAF to determine the total
CBMD FTE. If a CBMD Direct man-hour equation has been developed, apply the SIAF as reflected in
Table 13.6, CBMD SIAF Application.

        Requirement
         C. Multiply the SIAF by the regression coefficients of the CBMD Y(CBMD DIR) equation
        (if available). For example: Y(CBMD DIR) = a + bX, Y(Total) = a (SIAF) + b(SIAF).
         Y(CBMD DIR) = 309.12 + 5.6555X, Y(Total) = 309.12 (1.0785) + 5.6555(1.0785)X, Y(Total)
        = 333.39 + 6.099X, Where X = 210 widgets, Y(Total) = 333.39 + 6.099(210), Y(Total) =
        1614.18, CBMD FTE = 1614.18/Applicable MAF = 1614.18/149.6 = 10.79 FTE


13.8.5. Using the CBMD SIAF:
13.8.5.1. The study team must use caution when selecting the CBMD SIAF. Review the FAC family def-
initions in paragraphs 13.6.2.1 through 13.6.2.6 and select the SIAF that best fits the work center or func-
tion being studied. Ensure the standard indirect description reflected in AFMS 00AA applies. If ANY of
the indirect task definition elements are not done, or additional elements are done, the SIAF CANNOT be
used. You must measure the indirect workload using the SIAM task measurement instructions reflected on
the SIAM task data sheet.
AFMAN38-208V2 19 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                     333


13.8.5.2. Use logic. If the SIAF allowed time is not representative of what normally occurs in the CBMD
defined environment the study team should measure the task using the SIAM task data sheet measurement
instructions.
