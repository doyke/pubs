                     439th AIRLIFT WING
                 INSPECTOR GENERAL OFFICE
The Air Force has a well-established complaint program to address both personal
 and Fraud, Waste and Abuse issues. This program is described in AFI 90-301.
                                        REMEMBER,
                         No one may deny you access to the IG!
                                             BUT,
     The IG program doesn’t normally handle issues that are covered by other
 directives and you must use the appeal procedures specified by those directives.
                         IN DOUBT? LET’S TALK ABOUT IT !
