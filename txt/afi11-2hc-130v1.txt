       guidelines of this instruction.
AFI11-2HC-130V1 16 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                               9


       1.4.7.3. Ensure they only participate in unsupervised ground and flying training activities
       for which they are fully qualified.
1.5. Aircrew Training. Training programs are designed to progress aircrew members from
Initial Qualification Training (IQT), then to Mission Qualification Training (MQT), and finally
to Continuation Training (CT).
   1.5.1. Formal Schools. The primary method for accomplishing IQT and MQT is to attend
   and complete the appropriate formal training course listed in the Education Training Course
   Announcement (ETCA). NOTE: The ETCA serves as a reference for the Air Force, other
   military services, DOD government agencies, and security assistance programs. The current
   syllabus of instruction (SOI) must be referenced to determine all course prerequisite
   requirements. Current formal school SOIs can be found at the AETC Bookstore on the AF
   Portal.
   1.5.2. Initial Qualification Training. IQT provides the training necessary to initially
   qualify or re-qualify aircrew in basic positions and flying duties without regard to a unit's
   mission. Upon completion of IQT, aircrew members attain Basic Aircraft Qualification
   (BAQ) status. BAQ is a prerequisite for MQT. See Chapter 2 for additional guidance on
   IQT.
       1.5.2.1. Except for General Officers above the wing level, BAQ is not a long-term
       qualification status.
       1.5.2.2. Aircrew (other than General Officers) who remain in BAQ status for more than
       six months will be restricted to flying in supervised status until completion of MQT or
       waivered to remain BAQ.
       1.5.2.3. MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority for any aircrew member (other than
       General Officers above the wing level) to remain in a long-term BAQ status.
   1.5.3. Mission Qualification Training. MQT provides the training necessary to initially
   qualify or re-qualify aircrew members in assigned positions to perform the command or unit
   mission. Aircrew members maintain BAQ status until they complete MQT. Completion of
   MQT is a pre-requisite for certification as Basic Mission Capable (BMC) or Combat Mission
   Ready (CMR). See Chapter 3 for additional guidance on MQT and mission certification.
   1.5.4. Specialized Training. Specialized training is any training in specialized tactics,
   mission events, or flight responsibilities necessary to carry out the unit's assigned mission
   and not required by all crewmembers or all crew positions. Specialized training consists of
   upgrade training, special mission qualifications, and aircrew certifications, as well as any
   continuation training required to maintain these capabilities. See Chapter 5.
   1.5.5. Continuation Training (CT). CT is training required to maintain the assigned level
   of currency and proficiency for qualified aircrew. There are two aspects of CT. The first
   consists of training in the basic skills required to ensure the safe operation of the aircraft.
   The second consists of training in specific mission-related skills required to accomplish the
   unit's assigned mission(s). CT will be conducted IAW Chapter 4 and the RTM.
1.6. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP). RAP is a CT program designed to provide a realistic
training to meet all designed operational capability (DOC) tasked requirements as well as
specific AEF requirements. It provides the minimum required mix of periodic events and sorties
 10                                               AFI11-2HC-130V1 16 SEPTEMBER 2011


an aircrew must accomplish to sustain mission readiness. MAJCOM/A3 will determine RAP
training requirements for subordinate units. RAP training requirements will be implemented via
MAJCOM RTM. Following completion of MQT, aircrew will have received training in the basic
mission of the HC-130. Aircrew will then be certified BMC or CMR, as required.
   1.6.1. CMR Status.
       1.6.1.1. CC-Coded Units (Combat Coded)
          1.6.1.1.1. All active duty API-1/2/A positions, flying SQ/CC and SQ/DO positions
          are designated CMR positions.
          1.6.1.1.2. OG/CCs may designate other API-6/B positions not assigned to the flying
          squadron as CMR.
       1.6.1.2. (ANG Only) Any aircrew member may be designated CMR or BMC at OG/CC
       discretion.
       1.6.1.3. CMR aircrew will maintain all flight and ground currencies and accomplish all
       RAP designated training which affects CMR status. Failure to accomplish this training
       results in regression to Non-CMR (N-CMR) status unless waived by appropriate
       authority.
   1.6.2. BMC Status.
       1.6.2.1. CC-Coded Units.
          1.6.2.1.1. All active duty wing aircrew positions not designated CMR positions, are
          BMC positions.
          1.6.2.1.2. BMC status is assigned to aircrew members who have a primary job
          performing wing supervision or staff functions that directly support flying operations.
          These aircrew members are required to provide additional sortie generation
          capability, either in lieu of or in addition to, the personnel assigned to the flying
          squadrons. BMC aircrew members maintain qualification in all unit core mission
          events and may be certified/qualified in specialized training events.
       1.6.2.2. Designated Training (TF-Coded)/ Test (CB-Coded) Aircraft Unit
       Requirements. All assigned and attached FTU and test unit aircrew will maintain BMC
       status. Chapter 4 details CT requirements to include specific guidance for FTU and test
       units.    NOTE: FTU and test aircrew will complete supported MAJCOM CMR
       requirements just-in-time when tasked to augment operational deployments.
       1.6.2.3. BMC aircrew will maintain all flight and ground currencies and accomplish all
       RAP designated training which affects BMC status. Failure to accomplish this training
       results in regression to Non-BMC (N-BMC) status unless waived by appropriate
       authority. EXCEPTION: AETC will determine regression requirements for FTU
       aircrew. See Chapter 4.
       1.6.2.4. BMC aircrew may participate in any mission for which they are current and
       qualified, without additional training, as determined by the SQ/CC.
   1.6.3. N-CMR/N-BMC. Aircrew members that regress to N-CMR/N-BMC status will
   complete required remediation IAW Chapter 4.
AFI11-2HC-130V1 16 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                             11


   1.6.4. RAP Policy and Management. RAP is executed IAW this instruction and the
   current MAJCOM RAP Tasking Memorandum. The RTM may contain updated training
   requirements and events not yet incorporated into this instruction.
      1.6.4.1. Training Cycle. The continuation training cycle is defined by the RTM.
      1.6.4.2. The RAP Tasking Memorandum. Each RAP training level (BMC, CMR) is
      defined by a total number of RAP requirements, broken down into sortie types and
      associated events as determined by the MAJCOM and based on whether the aircrew
      member is designated experienced or non-experienced. The RTM will specify the
      following for each training level: EXCEPTION: AETC developed RTMs may be
      tailored as required to define CT requirements specific to FTU operations.
          1.6.4.2.1. Total RAP sortie requirements for the training cycle.
          1.6.4.2.2. Total RAP events requirements for the training cycle. NOTE: Total RAP
          sorties and events as defined by the RTM are minimums and may not be reduced
          except by proration, waiver or situations as stipulated by this instruction. The
          breakout of sortie types, as defined by the RTM, is provided as a guideline to be
          followed as closely as possible but variances are authorized. SQ/CCs may use
          variations in sortie types as a basis for end-of-cycle regression.
          1.6.4.2.3. 1- and 3-month RAP sortie lookback volume requirements as well as
          guidance on sorties authorized to count toward RAP lookback.
          1.6.4.2.4. Additional training requirements as directed by the MAJCOM.
   1.6.5. RAP Training Reports. Submit periodic RAP training reports IAW RTM guidance.
   1.6.6. RAP Training Sortie Development. Design training missions to achieve combat
   capability in squadron tasked roles, maintain proficiency, and enhance mission
   accomplishment and safety. An effective RAP training sortie requires accomplishing a
   tactical mission profile or a building block type sortie. RAP training missions should
   emphasize either basic combat skills or scenarios that reflect procedures and operations based
   on employment plans, location, current intelligence, and opposition capabilities. Use of
   procedures and actions applicable to combat scenarios are desired (e.g., appropriate use of
   code words, authentication procedures, combat tactics, safe recovery procedures, tactical
   deception, in-flight reports, threat reactions, Intel briefing/debriefing). Tactical training
   should include the use of threat simulators and countermeasures, and include participation
   with other rescue weapon systems and support aircraft to the maximum extent possible.
1.7. Sortie Allocation Guidance.
   1.7.1. For CC-coded units. The SQ/CC's first priority should be to train all designated
   aircrew to CMR. Inexperienced API-1/2/A aircrew members should receive sortie allocation
   priority over experienced aircrew members. Priorities for sortie allocation are as follows:
   CMR/API-1/2/A, CMR API-6/B, BMC (API-All).
   1.7.2. Units should provide attached API 6/8/B/D flyers adequate resources to maintain
   minimum training requirements. However, API-6/8/B/D flyer support will not come at the
   expense of the flying squadron's primary mission. If units cannot meet attached flyer
   requirements, they must request relief IAW AFI 11-401, as supplemented. Units requiring
 12                                                 AFI11-2HC-130V1 16 SEPTEMBER 2011


   flying hour adjustments for attached API-8/D and applicable API-6/B flyers must request
   program changes IAW MAJCOM directives.
1.8. Aircrew Utilization/Management. See AFI 11-412, Aircrew Management.
1.9. In-Unit Training Time Limitations (N/A Formal Training Units). Training conducted
in unit will comply with the time limitations annotated in Table 1.1

Table 1.1. In-Unit Training Time Limitations.

   1.9.1. Training time starts when the first syllabus of instruction (SOI)-directed training event
   is begun; or 45-days (90-days ARC) after being attached or assigned to the unit upon
   completion of the formal school, whichever occurs first. Training time ends with the formal
   evaluation or certification, as applicable.
   1.9.2. Individuals unable to complete training within time limits specified in Table 1.1 may
   continue training; however, units will notify MAJCOM/A3T (A3J for ACC) and provide a
   description of the factors contributing to delayed training along with an expected completion
   date.
1.10. Formal Training Conducted In Unit (Secondary Method Training). When attendance
at a formal school course is not practical or no quotas exist, units may request a waiver to
conduct training in-unit using formal school syllabus and courseware. Any aircrew member who
has previously failed to complete a formal course for substandard performance will not be issued
a secondary method training waiver for the same course.
   1.10.1. Waiver Approval Authority. MAJCOM/A3T (A3J for ACC) is the approval
   authority to conduct formal qualification training in unit.
       1.10.1.1. SOI mission objectives and tasks are the minimum required for formal course
       qualification training. When the courseware is adapted for local use, modify it only if the
       training is incompatible with local training conditions (i.e., no simulators).
       MAJCOM/A3T (A3J for ACC and ACC/A3G for NGB) is the waiver authority to
       deviate from the formal requirements of qualification training conducted locally.
       1.10.1.2. Maintain in-unit waiver approval in the individual's AF Form 4022, Aircrew
       Training Folder.
AFI11-2HC-130V1 16 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                             13


   1.10.2. Formal School Courseware Requests. For secondary method training, the waiver
   authority will include the appropriate formal school as an addressee on all correspondence
   and will request that the formal school forward applicable courseware to the aircrew
   member‘s unit of assignment. Courseware includes but is not limited to; the course syllabus
   of instruction (SOI), briefings, computer based training (CBT) modules, instructor guides,
   training guides and student grade sheets. This information may be web-based or available
   through other digital mediums. The unit training office will verify currency of the
   courseware obtained.
      1.10.2.1. Use formal school courseware received for training only the individual
      referenced in the waiver.
      1.10.2.2. If the course includes an end of course exam, substitute a locally developed
      exam. Passing score is 85 percent.
   1.10.3. When a formal school course is authorized to be conducted in unit, the gaining
   MAJCOM assumes responsibility for providing this training locally. In addition to the
   guidance found in Chapters 2, 3 and 5, the following applies to SMT:
      1.10.3.1. Training will be completed within the time limits specified by paragraph 1.9
      1.10.3.2. Ground and Flying Training Requirements. Training sequence and event
      prerequisites will be IAW the formal course SOI. NOTE: For formal courses conducted
      in unit, the SQ/CC conducting training is the approval authority for sequence of training
      waivers. All SOI caveats and restrictions associated with Sequence of training waivers
      apply.
1.11. Active Duty Service Commitments (N/A ARC). Formal training conducted may incur
an active duty service commitment IAW AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service Commitments
(ADSC).
   1.11.1. Units will ensure crewmembers who are directed to attend an education or formal
   training course, whether via Permanent Change of Station (PCS), TDY or Permanent Change
   of Assignment (PCA), process through the Military Personnel Flight (MPF) for ADSC
   counseling and completion of the AF Form 63 or other required ADSC acknowledgment
   before entering an ADSC-incurring event.
   1.11.2. For SMT, units will coordinate with the servicing MPF to ensure individuals
   acknowledge any ADSC required and that the ADSC is properly processed once training is
   completed.
1.12. Training Docummentation, Records and Reports.
   1.12.1. Units will maintain individual training records IAW Chapter 6 and the following:
      1.12.1.1. AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew Training.
      1.12.1.2. AFI 11-401, Flight Management.

  1.12.2. Career Enlisted Aviators (CEA) Training Documentation. All enlisted aircrew
  qualifications are separate and distinct from skill level qualification. When AF Form 8,
  Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, is completed for the applicable flight evaluation, then
  that crewmember is qualified to perform all duties assigned to that crew qualification
  regardless of skill level. Aircrew instructor qualifications and flight examiner certifications
  are also separate and distinct from OJT trainer or certifier designation and are reflected in the
  AFSC by use of ―K‖ prefix (aircrew instructor) and ―Q‖ prefix (aircrew standardization and
  evaluation flight examiner). IAW Career Field Education and Training Plans (CFETP),
  personnel in Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) 1AXXX are exempt from maintaining the AF
  Form 623, On-the-job Training Record.
  1.12.3. Permanent Training Folders (PTF). Units will maintain a permanent training
  folder for each crewmember and ensure folders are forwarded to gaining units when
  individuals PCS. Gaining unit commanders may elect to keep records of past training
  programs. MAJCOMs may define the minimum requirements for PTFs. If specific
  MAJCOM guidance does not exists, the minimum requirements are as follows:     NOTE:
  IAW Chapter 6, MAJCOMS may direct the use of different training documentation systems
  (e.g. TIMS/GTIMS or other electronic programs), forms and standards. In this case,
  MAJCOMs will also define PTF format and contents requirements.

                          MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. General. This chapter establishes minimum criteria and training requirements for MQT
and mission certification (assignment of BMC or CMR status). The primary method of mission
qualification training is to attend and complete the appropriate formal training course listed in the
ETCA. Completion of the appropriate formal course satisfies all MQT requirements. When
attendance is not practical or no quotas exist, units may request a waiver to conduct in-unit MQT
using formal school courseware IAW paragraph 1.10
3.2. Formal Training Course Prerequisites. Complete formal training prerequisites IAW the
formal course syllabus of instruction.
   3.2.1. Mobility Pilot Development (MPD). IAW AFI 11-2HC-130V2, HC-130 Aircrew
   Evaluation Criteria, MPD trained pilots will fly all MQT and initial mission evaluation
   sorties from the right seat and will be coded as mission copilots in the crew position block on
   the AF Form 8.
   3.2.2. Prior Qualified Pilots (PQP). Pilots cross flowing from first assignment instructor
   pilot (FAIP) duty, operational support aircraft (OSA) or other MDS, may complete MQT as a
   mission pilot (left seat training) or mission copilot (right seat training) IAW Table 3.1.

     NOTE: At unit commanders‘ discretion, any PQP candidate can be trained as a MC for MQT
3.3. Ground Training Requirements. Complete ground training requirements IAW the formal
course syllabus of instruction.
3.4. Flying Training requirements. Complete flying training requirements in accordance with
the formal course syllabus of instruction and the following:
   3.4.1. High winds or non-availability of parachutists may cause loadmasters to complete the
   FTU mission qualification course without conducting actual personnel airdrops. In these
   cases, use standard airdrop training bundles (SATB) during flight training. If actual
   personnel airdrops were not accomplished during formal training, the FTU will issue a
   restricted AF Form 8 IAW AFI 11-2HC-130V2. Accomplish final certification for personnel
   airdrop in-unit under the supervision of an instructor or flight examiner loadmaster on an
   actual static line personnel airdrop. Loadmasters will not be certified CMR until final
   certification for personnel airdrops is completed.
   3.4.2. Maximum Effort Takeoff and Landing Training. During mission qualification,
   conduct maximum effort takeoff and landing training on a landing zone (or painted landing
   zone) of 3,000 feet or longer. Maximum effort takeoffs should be performed from the main
   runway when it is available (i.e., safe and practical to taxi from the landing zone).

   3.4.3. Units North of the 60 Parallel. When MQT is conducted in unit, crewmembers in
   units north of the 60 N parallel who are scheduled to complete MQT during the summer
   months (May through August), have until 31 October to complete the required night/NVG
   training events. The mission qualification evaluation for these crewmembers may be
   administered before completing night training events.
   3.4.4. Conduct flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-HC-130V2.
3.5. Mission Certification. Mission qualification is a prerequsite for mission certification or
recertification, as required. The SQ/CC will certify crewmembers as BMC or CMR upon
completion of all required training.
   3.5.1. Basic Mission Capable Certification. Mission qualified aircrew will complete the
   following requirements prior to BMC certification.
       3.5.1.1. Ground Training Requirements. Complete all applicable ground training IAW
       Tables 4.2 through Table 4.5 and the RTM. Training missions may be flown before
       completing all items listed, provided all grounding events are accomplished.
       3.5.1.2. Flying Training Requirements. Complete all applicable flying training affecting
       BMC status IAW Tables 4.6 through Tables 4.10 and the RTM. After completing all
       required flying training requirements and prior to completing all ground training events,
       SQ/CCs may allow crewmembers to fly unsupervised on missions not requiring provided
       remaining ground training items do not mandate instructor supervision and do not affect
       mission accomplishment.
   3.5.2. Combat Mission Ready (CMR) Certification. Certification as CMR requires the
   following:
       3.5.3.1. A 1-month lookback at the CMR sortie rate. See RTM.
       3.5.3.2. Qualification and/or certification in any specialized training required for CMR
       status. See Chapter 5.

  4.5.3. Ground Training Events. The following paragraphs provide definitions and criteria
  for ground training events governed or amplified by this instruction.
      4.5.3.1. Aircrew Tactics Continuation Training [GA59]. Units will establish a tactics
      academic program to accomplish initial and CT requirements. Tactics Continuation
      Training will normally be conducted in conjunction with Intelligence Training [IE15].
         4.5.3.1.1. Training will be administered using lessons/courseware developed by the
         unit tactics shop and designed to prepare crewmembers to operate more effectively in
         the combat rescue environment. Training will be based on tactical employment
         information found in AFTTP 3-1.HC-130, AFTTP 3-3.HC-130 and AFI 11-2HC-
         130V3, as well as any other tactics documents pertaining to the execution of the
         unit‘s mission.      Academics should be tailored to theater-specific mission
         requirements and unit METLs.
         4.5.3.1.2. Units may use adapted courseware from the AMC Combat Operations

        monthly SEPT requirement.
     4.5.3.14. Theater Indoctrination (TI) Training [GA33]. Units will develop a program
     to ensure personnel are trained for theater-specific flight operations prior to a contingency
     deployment. As a minimum, this training will include a thorough review of theater-
     unique instrument requirements and procedures, the use of non-DoD instrument approach
     procedures, required instrumentation for specific approaches, geography, terrain,
     climatology, command and control procedures, Aviation Unit Prep Messages, theater
     resources and their disposition, rules of engagement, LOAC, local area procedures (e.g.
     SPINS, ACO, reporting instructions, etc), host nation agreements, current force
     protection environment, and current intelligence/threat assessment. TI training should be
     completed no earlier than 60 days prior to deployment.
     4.5.3.15. Verification Planning Exercise (VPE) [GS52]. Initial and refresher VPEs
     provides training to update crewmembers on their squadron‘s wartime mission and allow
     them the opportunity to apply the tactical knowledge they have gained. It consists of an
     in-depth combat rescue mission planning scenario, normally completed with a full crew
     complement. Initial Verification Training is required prior to CMR certification. BMC
     pilots will participate in verification training as determined by the SQ/CC.
        4.5.3.15.1. VPEs should provide crews the opportunity to exercise local mission
        planning support processes such as intelligence, weather, rules of engagement and
        legal (Judge Advocate) mission considerations. Tailor VPEs to prepare aircrew to
        support a specific OPLAN/CONPLAN/AEF or other rotational tasking. Refer to the
        Verification Planning Exercise Guide in Attachment 2 for specific guidelines on
        developing a verification planning exercise.
        4.5.3.15.2. Crewmembers who participate in a unit contingency deployment, exercise
        mission, or complete theater indoctrination training may receive credit for
        continuation verification training at SQ/CC discretion.

Figure 4.2. Amplifying Notes for Flying Training Tables.
 E = Experienced I = Inexperienced
 Note 1 – Volume requirements are IAW MAJCOM RTM
 Note 2 – Events may be dual logged IAW Attachment 3 guidance.
 Note 3 – All currency in expressed in days except CDTQT. m = months.
 Note 4 – Volume only requirement for noted event/sortie unless currency mandated by
 MAJCOM.
 Note 5 – Currency expires at the end of the month.
 Note 6 – BAQ currency requirement.
 Note 7 – Loss of currency in this event results in loss of currency in the aircraft. Individual
 will fly in supervised status until currency is regained.
 Note 8 – Loss of currency in these events for greater than six months results in loss of BAQ.
 Note 9 – Loss of currency in these events for greater than six months results in a loss of
 mission qualification. EXCEPTION: Loss of currency in NVG landings [LD33] does not
 affect mission qualification for MCs. Loss of currency in CDS events [AD04, AD24, and
 AD25] does not affect mission qualification for ARC crews.
 Note 10 – Event requires certification/special qualification for some or all crew positions.
 Currency requirement only applies to certified/qualified crewmembers in units which maintain
 this specialized training. For clarification, this note only applies to MCs for the following
 38                                                  AFI11-2HC-130V1 16 SEPTEMBER 2011


 events: TO27, LD33 and LD34.
 Note 11 – AFRC and ANG will determine if subordinate units maintain qualification in CDS.
 Note 12 – When circumstances preclude in-flight execution of this event, event may be
 accomplished in a stationary aircraft providing all other event criteria are met (Authenticate
 and Encode/Decode events may be accomplished via tabletop discussion).

 Note 13 – Due to limited availability of equipment/resources, MAJCOMs will determine
 currency requirements for this event. This responsibility may be further delegated to the unit
 level and restricted to just-in-time, deployment spin-up training.

 Note 14 – Applies to units with homestation simulator only.
4.7. Recurrency Training. Training is required whenever an aircrew member does not meet a
currency requirement of this instruction.
   4.7.1. Loss of Currency. Failure to maintain currency IAW Tables 4.5 through Table 4.9,
   or as outlined in RTM, results in a loss of currency for that event, unless specifically noted
   otherwise.
       4.7.1.1. Unless specifically noted otherwise, crewmembers are non-current the day after
       event currency expires.
       4.7.1.2. Place individuals delinquent in one or more flying training currency events in
       supervised training status for the event. Loss of currency prohibits an individual from
       accomplishing unsupervised in-flight duties in the non-current event(s). EXCEPTION:
       Loss of currency in certain BAQ events, noted in the flying training tables, result in the
       loss of aircraft currency. Individual will fly in supervised status until recurrent.
       4.7.1.3. To regain currency, delinquent events must be demonstrated to the satisfaction
       of an instructor. The SQ/CC may direct additional training as required.
   4.7.2. Loss of currency in flying training events annotated as affecting BMC/CMR may
   require regression to N-BMC/N-CMR IAW paragraph 4.11
   4.7.3. Loss of currency exceeding 6-months.
       4.7.3.1. Loss of currency for certain BAQ events in excess of six months results in the
       loss of BAQ. See Table 4.6 through Table 4.10 and associated Note 8.
       4.7.3.2. Loss of currency for certain mission events in excess of six months results in
       loss of mission qualification. See Table 4.6 through Table 4.10 and associated Note 9.
   4.7.4. Currency for Training North of the 60 Degree Parallel. Aircrew members
   assigned to units north of the 60-degree parallel handle night/NVG currency as follows:
       4.7.4.1. Only day sortie/event currencies from 1 April to 30 September need be
       maintained. Consider all experienced crew members current for night sorties/ events on 1
       October providing day currencies have been maintained. Inexperienced aircrew members
       regain night currency by demonstrating proficiency in delinquent sorties/events to an
       instructor.
AFI11-2HC-130V1 16 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                             39


       4.7.4.2. NVG Currency does not need to be maintained from 1 April through 30
       September, however to remain BMC/CMR currency must be regained by 31 October. To
       regain currency, the most appropriate instructors, as selected by the SQ/CC will fly an
       NVG route. Other non-current crew members will regain currency by demonstrating
       proficiency to an instructor.
4.8. Requalification Training. Crewmembers requiring requalification will accomplish
training IAW AFI 11-202V1, AFI 11-202V2, AFI 11-2HC-130V2 and this instruction.
4.9. Multiple Series C-130 Certifications.
   4.9.1. (N/A AETC) Rescue MC-130P qualified aircrew may fly RAP events in HC-
   130H/N/P aircraft (and vice versa) without additional waiver or additional currencies
   provided differences training is accomplished IAW Chapter 2.
   4.9.2. MAJCOMs will define authorized RAP events/sorties that may be accomplished on
   C130E/H and demodified EC130/WC130H BAI. Differences training will be conducted
   IAW Chapter 2.
4.10. Other Training Categories.
   4.10.1. Flight Surgeon Continuation Flying Requirements. AFI 11-202V1 establishes
   flight surgeon continuation flying requirements. Ground Training requirements are the same
   as Flight Test Engineers located in Table 4.11
   4.10.2. Flight Test Engineers (FTE). The flight test engineer is an authorized aircrew
   composition for all ACC aircraft IAW AFI 65-503, Table 36-1, Authorized Aircrew
   Composition-Active Forces.         Any ACC, AFMC or ARC flight test engineer
   assigned/attached to a dedicated test organization, on Aeronautical Orders and authorized to
   fly on HC-130 aircraft (documented on AF Form 480) is permitted to fly on any HC-130
   aircraft during designated flight test sorties and any spin up and familiarization flights
   required for test plan development.
       4.10.2.1. For operational units supporting testing requirements, the OG/CC will approve
       FTE to fly on unit aircraft and designate the HARMS office to track currency
       requirements. Duration of approval is at the discretion of the OG/CC and based on
       testing support requirements. Approval should be documented as a memorandum for
       record maintained by the HARMS office.
       4.10.2.2. The FTE will accomplish and maintain ground currencies IAW the Table 4.11
       4.10.2.3. There are no flight currency requirements for FTEs.

 NOTES:

 m – months

 1. Waiver authority for the ground training specified is IAW the reference directive.

 2. Flight Test Engineer only requires initial CRM

 3. Required prior to first flight

4.11. N-BMC/N-CMR Regression. Aircrew may be regressed to N-BMC or N-CMR for one
or more of the reasons listed in the following paragraphs. EXCEPTION: AETC will determine
regression policy and guidance for FTU aircrew.
   4.11.1. While N-BMC/N-CMR, the SQ/CC will determine missions the aircrew may
   perform and supervision required.
   4.11.2. Units will track regression of all aircrew using unit certification document or
   approved unit developed product.
   4.11.3. Regression for loss of currency. Currency status for the purpose of tracking and
   reporting regression will be determined by units on the first duty day of each month.
       4.11.3.1. Aircrew delinquent for a ground training event affecting BMC/CMR status will
       be regressed to N-BMC/N-CMR. Crewmembers will accomplish the required ground
       training IAW governing directive prior to recertification.
       4.11.3.2. Loss of Flying Training Currency. Loss of currency in a flight training
       sortie/event affecting BMC/CMR status will result in regression to N-BMC/N-CMR.
       Crewmembers will regain currency in delinquent sortie/event prior to being recertified as
       CMR. NOTE: N-BMC/N-CMR crewmembers may fly unsupervised on CONUS and
       OCONUS missions if delinquent events are not flown, are not required for mission
       accomplishment, and do not result in loss in aircraft currency or qualification. OG/CC
       approval is required for other than local, routine or non-contingency missions.
AFI11-2HC-130V1 16 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                          41


  4.11.4. Regression for Failure to Meet RAP Lookback. 1-month and 3-month RAP
  Lookback sortie requirements (rates) will be defined in the RTM. Both 1-month and 3-
  month sortie lookback totals will be calculated on the first duty day of each month for both
  BMC and CMR aircrew. Only designated RAP sorties and contingency operations sorties
  may be used to determine lookback.
     4.11.4.1. Failure to Meet 1-Month Lookback. If a BMC/CMR aircrew member does
     not meet their 1-month RAP lookback requirements, a review will be made of their 3-
     month RAP lookback requirements. If the 3-month lookback has been met, aircrew may,
     at SQ/CC discretion, remain in CMR status.
     4.11.4.2. Failure to Meet 3-Month Lookback. If an aircrew member fails to meet the
     3-month lookback requirement, SQ/CCs may either place the crewmember in probation
     status for one month or regress the crewmember to N-CMR/N-BMC.
         4.11.4.2.1. Probation. Place aircrew in probation status for 1 month (30 days). If
         SQ/CC chooses probation, the aircrew member will reestablish a 1-month lookback at
         the end of the probation period to remain BMC/CMR. Failure to establish a 1-month
         lookback at the end of the probation period will result in regression to N-BMC/N-
         CMR. Probation status will be documented in the individual‘s training folder.
         4.11.4.2.2. CMR/BMC crewmembers regressed to N-CMR/N-BMC must complete a
         SQ/CC-approved recertification program. At a minimum this program will consist of
         RAP sorties equaling 1/2 of the required monthly RAP sortie rate. Upon completion
         of the program, crewmembers must then meet a 1-month lookback prior to
         recertification as CMR/BMC. Missions and events accomplished during the
         recertification program apply toward monthly and training-cycle RAP requirements.
     4.11.4.3. For aircrew members who do not meet lookback requirements throughout the
     training cycle, the SQ/CC may elect to initiate the following actions:
         4.11.4.3.1. Place aircrew member in commander directed training program to regain
         CMR status.
         4.11.4.3.2. Remove the aircrew member from a CMR manning position.
         4.11.4.3.3. Remove the aircrew member from active flying status.
     4.11.4.4. Lookback computations for new aircrew members begin following completion
     of MQT. New aircrew members who have been mission certified for less than 3 months
     will meet 1-month lookback to maintain status until a 3-month lookback is established.
     SQ/CCs may apply probation rules if a new aircrew member fails to meet 1-month
     lookback while establishing 3-month lookback.
 42                                              AFI11-2HC-130V1 16 SEPTEMBER 2011


Figure 4.3. Lookback Regression Flow Chart.




   4.11.5. Regression for failure of a Periodic Evaluation. Aircrew members who fail a
   periodic evaluation will be regress to N-CMR or N-BMC, as applicable. Requalification is
   required prior to recertification as BMC or CMR.
   4.11.6. Regression for Failure to Meet End-of-Training-Cycle Requirements. Aircrew
   who fail to complete RTM-defined, end-of-cycle sortie and/or event requirements may
   require additional training depending on the type and magnitude of the deficiency. In all
   cases, report training shortfalls IAW RTM guidance.
      4.11.6.1. Refer to paragraph 4.12 to determine if proration can be applied.
      4.11.6.2. End-of-Cycle training requirements are based on the aircrew member‘s
      experience level on the last day of the current training cycle.
      4.11.6.3. Failure to Meet End-of-Cycle Total RAP Sortie Requirements.
AFI11-2HC-130V1 16 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                              43


           4.11.6.3.1. Aircrew failing to meet end-of-cycle total RAP sortie requirements may
           continue at CMR/BMC if both 1- and 3-month RAP lookback requirements are met
           and sortie deficiencies are deemed insignificant by the SQ/CC.
           4.11.6.3.2. If the SQ/CC determines the sortie deficiency is significant or lookback is
           not met, the crew member will be regressed to N-CMR/N-BMC. To regain
           CMR/BMC status, aircrew must complete a SQ/CC approved recertification program.
           NOTE: Sortie type breakout, as defined by the RTM, is provided as a guideline. This
           should normally be followed as closely as possible, but variances are authorized.
           SQ/CCs may use variations in sortie types as a basis for end-of-cycle regression. If
           the SQ/CC determines sortie type deficiency is significant, aircrew may be regressed
           to N-CMR/N-BMC. Prior to CMR/BMC recertification, aircrew will complete all
           deficient sortie types and any additional training as determined by the SQ/CC. These
           sorties may count towards total requirements for the new training cycle.
       4.11.6.4. Failure to Meet End-of-Cycle RAP Event Requirements. Aircrew failing to
       meet end-of-cycle RAP event requirements will be regressed to N-BMC/N-CMR. Prior
       to CMR/BMC recertification, aircrew must complete all deficient events and any
       additional training as determined by the SQ/CC. Remedial events may count towards
       total requirements for the new training cycle.
4.12. Proration of End-of-Cycle Requirements. At the end of the training cycle, the SQ/CC
may prorate training requirements for DNIF status, emergency leaves, non-flying
TDY/exercises, combat/contingency deployments, (ANG, AFRC: and/or mandatory training
required for civilian employment) preclude training for a portion of the training cycle. Normal
annual leave will not be considered as non-availability. Extended bad weather that precludes the
unit from flying for more than 15 consecutive days may be considered as non-availability. The
following guidelines apply:
   4.12.1. Proration will not be used to mask training or planning deficiencies.
   4.12.2. Proration is based on cumulative days of non-availability for flying during the
   training cycle. Use Table 4.12 to determine the number of months to be prorated based on
   cumulative calendar days of non-availability.
   4.12.3. If IQT or MQT is completed after the start of the training cycle, prorated training
   requirements for availability following completion of formal training.
   4.12.4. Proration Formula. Use the following formula to determine prorated training
   requirements: number of months available times the sortie/event volume divided by the
   number of months in the training period. Round prorated fractions of less than 0.5 to the
   next lower whole number. Do not prorate below one.

  4.12.5. Contingency Operations.
     4.12.5.1. CMR aircrews TDY/deployed in support of actual flying contingency
     operations may be reported as CMR throughout the TDY/deployment.
     4.12.5.2. -(ARC only) Individuals deployed for more than a seven-day period may apply
     one month portion of RAP sorties and events.
     4.12.5.3. All sorties flown during contingency operations will be logged as contingency
     operations sorties. Normally, these sorties and the events logged on them do not count
     toward total RAP requirements for the training cycle, but may be used for lookback and
     to update currencies. Upon returning from contingency operations, units will prorate
     training requirements based on the period of non-availability. Proration is authorized for
     the deployment preparation and recovery time where home station flying is reduced by
     the MAJCOM.
     4.12.5.4. ERQS/CCs may authorize contingency sorties that provided valid training to be
     logged toward total RAP requirements for the training cycle.
        4.12.5.4.1. Events accomplished on these sorties will count toward total RAP event
        requirements for the training cycle.
        4.12.5.4.2. Upon return from contingency operations, calculate the sorties/events to
        be prorated for the entire deployment, and then subtract the authorized number of
        contingency RAP sorties/events. The difference is the allowable sortie/event
        proration. Negative numbers equate to zero. The home station SQ/CC is the final
        approval authority for authorizing deployed accomplishments to be logged toward
        total RAP requirements for the training cycle.

 NOTES:
 1. Primary Aerospace Vehicle Authorized (PAA) hours include all C-130 hours since assigned to an HC-130 unit.
 ‗Other‘ flight time will not be used in calculating an individual‘s PAA hours. ‗Other‘ flight time in excess of 100
 hours will not be used in calculating an individual‘s Total hours.

 2. Hours logged in the HC-130, MC-130P and C-130E/H1/2/3 WST accomplishing formal or continuation events
 may be credited toward PAA and Total hours requirements. Approved WST hours will not exceed 20% of the
 total required hours from any of the listed categories.

3. The prerequisites are defined by total flying time and PAA time. For example, an HC-130 flight engineer
upgrading to instructor who has 1500 or more total hours, requires 200 PAA hours. If the individual has less than
1500 total hours, then he/she would require a minimum of 400 PAA hours for upgrade.

 4. OG/CC or equivalent may waive 10 percent of the total and PAA hours required for upgrade in all crew
 positions. A copy of the waiver must be filed in the individual‘s training record. Students will provide the formal
 school registrar with a copy of this waiver.

5. See ETCA for determining appropriate C-130E/H initial qualification courses: pilot initial qualification (PIQ),
navigator initial qualification (NIQ), flight engineer initial qualification (FIQ), and loadmaster initial qualification
(LIQ).

6. The C-130E/H pilot upgrade course C130EPRA2LP (basic and single ship mission) may be attended in lieu of
the PCO course if capacity does not exist or at the discretion of the SQ/CC.

7. The C-130E Pilot Upgrade course is C-130EPRA2LP (basic and single ship mission).

8. MF will have a X1A151 primary AFSC (or higher); X1A171 is desired.

9. ML will have a X1A251 primary AFSC (or higher); X1A271 is desired.

10. MK will have a X1A351 primary AFSC (or higher); X1A371 is desired.

11. Once PCO course requirements are integrated into the HC130-MP-UQ syllabus, the HC130-MP-UQ course
will be the only task/event upgrade requirement for mission copilots under dual seat progression.




5.3. Mobility Pilot Development and Mission Pilot Upgrade. Mobility Pilot Development is
the initial level of C-130 pilot development for graduates of Specialized Undergraduate Pilot
Training (SUPT). During initial qualification training, MPD pilots are trained and evaluated on
instrument/qualification responsibilities while flying in the left seat. During MQT, MPD pilots
are trained and evaluated on mission responsibilities while flying in the right seat.
    5.3.1. Until completion of mission pilot upgrade, MPD pilots will be coded [Flight
    Authorization Duty Code] as mission copilots IAW AFI 11-401, as supplemented.
    5.3.2. MPD pilots are not trained or qualified at the FTU in pilot-flying maximum effort
    takeoffs/landings and will receive this qualification as part of the Pilot Checkout (PCO)
    Course [or mission pilot upgrade once PCO course elements are integrated into the SOI].
    There is no continuation training requirement for MPD pilots to fly maximum effort events.
    5.3.3. MPD pilots may maintain left seat basic qualification at the discretion of the squadron
    commander. The decision on whether or not the left seat basic qualification is maintained
AFI11-2HC-130V1 16 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                47


   affects progression and formal training requirements for mission pilot upgrade IAW this
   chapter.
5.4. MPD Dual Seat Progression [For MCs maintaining Left Seat Basic Qualification]. For
mission copilots who maintain a left seat basic qualification, units should fly mission copilots
pilots in both seats to develop skills based on a careful balance between left seat
instrument/qualification proficiency and right seat mission experience. The following general
guidance is based on a building block approach for MPD development. It is not intended to deny
flexibility units for developing MPD pilots in the manner best suited for their mission
requirements.
   5.4.1. Unit Indoctrination. During unit indoctrination, mission copilots should fly all
   sorties from the right seat to reinforce training conduct in MQT under local operating
   conditions.
   5.4.2. Stage 1 – Right Seat Mission Phase. After Unit Indoctrination, MPD pilots can fly
   sorties/events from either seat IAW the guidelines of paragraph 4.6.5
   Supervisors/commanders will evaluate operational risk and mission requirements when
   planning and conducting missions. In order to gain experience and proficiency, during the
   first 300 PAA hours, right seat mission duties and left seat instrument/qualification
   currencies should be emphasized to the maximum extent possible.
   5.4.3. Stage 2 – Dual Seat Mission Phase. After obtaining a minimum 300 PAA hours,
   mission copilots may be certified as Stage 2 by the SQ/CC. During Stage 2, units should
   seek to optimize the mix and volume of training by scheduling MPD pilots for left seat
   tactical sorties. Ideally, a desired mix is a 60/40 percent split for right seat and left seat
   mission sorties, respectively. This number is intended as a guide and will be dependent on
   scheduling restrictions, instructor availability and individual capabilities.
   5.4.4. Stage 3 – Formal Mission Pilot Upgrade. Mission copilots enter Stage 3 upon
   beginning formal training for mission pilot upgrade. See paragraph 5.6
   5.4.5. Stage Progression Tracking. A MPD training folder should be opened for mission
   copilots upon entering a dual seat phase. SQ/CCs may elect to initiate a training folder for
   mission copilots upon assignment to the unit. The AF Form 4000 series [or the equivalent
   electronic program/standard if authorized by the MAJCOM] will be used. This training
   folder will be used to document mission copilot status and progression and will remain open
   until a mission copilot is entered into formal training for mission pilot upgrade. Accomplish
   training folder documentation IAW this instruction (See paragraph 6.6) and the following
   exceptions:
       5.4.5.1. This folder is not subject to the in-unit training time limitations listed in Table
       1.1.
       5.4.5.2. Tracking and grading of specific flight maneuvers on AF Form 4024 is not
       required.
       5.4.5.3. Instructor pilots are responsible for providing training documentation and
       recommendations after all periods of instruction (both left and right seat sorties). Aircraft
       commanders are responsible for providing documentation and recommendations after
       off-station missions or as directed by SQ/DO.

       5.4.5.4. Unit Training Office will:
           5.4.5.4.1. Create standard AF Training Form overprints (if required).
           5.4.5.4.2. Ensure IPs and ACs complete required documentation.
           5.4.5.4.3. Ensure PTF reviews are completed and manage mission copilot PTFs.
           5.4.5.4.4. Review mission copilot progress during the unit Training Review Panel
           (TRP) process and forward metrics regarding unit MPD status when requested by
           MAJCOM.
   5.4.6. Periodic Evaluations. Mission copilots progressing through stage development will
   receive left seat instrument/qualification and right seat mission evaluations IAW AFI 11-
   2HC-130V2.
5.5. MPD Legacy Progression [For MCs not maintaining Left Seat Basic
Qualification]. Copilots who maintain only a right seat basic qualification will fly all BAQ and
mission event/sorties from the right seat until identified and certified as a mission pilot upgrade
candidate. Mission copilots must have at least 400 hours PAA prior to certification (‗Other‘
Time will not be included as part of this total). Once certified as a mission pilot upgrade
candidate, mission copilots will enter a unit-developed program to gain left seat experience and
build up aptitude in all mission pilot maneuvers including 3-engine landings, 3-engine go-
arounds, windmill taxi starts and maximum effort operations. Formal training for mission pilot
upgrade will be accomplished IAW paragraph 5.6
   5.5.1. A formal training folder will be opened for mission pilot upgrade candidates.
   Instructor pilots are responsible for providing training documentation and recommendations
   after all periods of left seat instruction. The unit training office will create standard AF
   Training Form overprints, as required.
   5.5.2. Periodic Evaluations. Mission copilots progressing through legacy development will
   receive right seat instrument/qualification and mission evaluations IAW AFI 11-2HC-130V2.
5.6. Mission Pilot Upgrade. Commanders will consider experience, knowledge and judgment
when identifying candidates. Nominees must have an in-depth knowledge of systems,
procedures, and instructions prior to entry into the upgrade program. Mission pilot upgrade is
designed to teach left seat mission qualification, as well as AC duties and responsibilities. See
Table 5.1 for flying hour prerequisites. Candidates will also meet all prerequisites listed in the
formal school syllabus of instruction.
   5.6.1. For mission copilots progressing through Dual Seat development, upgrade to mission
   pilot requires qualification in maximum effort airland operations, followed by successful
   completion of the HC-130 Mission Pilot Upgrade course.
       5.6.1.1. Qualification in maximum effort airland operations is obtained through the Pilot
       Checkout (PCO) course. Until this training is incorporated into the HC-130 Mission Pilot
       Upgrade SOI, mission copilots are authorized to be trained using the AETC PCO
       syllabus. Due to the limited availability of this course at the C-130E/H schoolhouse, no
       waiver is required to conduct the AETC PCO course via SMT.
       5.6.1.2. After successful completion of the PCO course, mission copilots will complete
       the HC-130 Mission Pilot Upgrade course. The primary method of mission pilot upgrade

   conduct in-unit qualification training using formal school courseware IAW paragraph 1.10
   EXCEPTION: ARC units may conduct mission pilot upgrade via SMT without waiver.
5.7. Aircraft Commander Certification. Pilots will not fly as a pilot-in-command until
certified by the SQ/CC as an aircraft commander.
   5.7.1. (N/A ARC) Following completion mission pilot upgrade, pilots should be certified as
   an aircraft commander within 120 days unless extenuating circumstances exist.
   5.7.2. Prior Qualified Pilots Certification. PQPs evaluated according to mission pilot
   standards during MQT will be enter a unit-developed AC certification program and may be
   certified after attaining a minimum of 100 PAA hours. Waiver authority for this requisite is
   the OG/CC.
       5.7.2.1. This 100 PAA hours may include time from formal school training.
       EXCEPTION: ‗Other‘ time will not be used.
       5.7.2.2. PQPs evaluated according to mission copilot standards during MQT, they will
       upgrade to mission pilot and then be certified as an aircraft commander using the same
       progression as an MPD-trained pilot.
   5.7.3. BAQ-only Aircraft Commanders. Mission copilots [MPD Dual Seat Progression
   only] who meet mission pilot upgrade hour prerequisites of Table 5.1 may be certified as a
   BAQ-only aircraft commanders. Selected individuals will be entered into a unit-developed
   certification program to ensure they have the experience, knowledge and judgment to act in
   this capacity.
5.8. Aircrew Instructor Upgrade. A sound and practical aircrew instructor program is a
prerequisite for effective training, standardization and aircraft mishap prevention. Unit
commanders will personally review each instructor candidate‘s qualifications and select
instructors based on their background, experience, maturity, and ability to instruct. The following
characteristics must be considered: instructional ability, judgment, personal qualities, technical
knowledge, flying experience and tactical experience.
   5.8.1. The primary method of initial instructor upgrade is to attend and complete the formal
   HC-130 instructor training course listed in the ETCA. When attendance is not practical or no

                             AIRCREW TRAINING RECORDS

6.1. General Information. This attachment provides guidelines on proper training
documentation when using standard hardcopy AF training forms. Instructions are provided for
AF Form 4022, Aircrew Training Folder, AF Form 4023, Aircrew Training Progress Report, AF
Form 4024, Aircrew Training Accomplishment Report, and AF Form 4025, Aircrew
Summary/Close-out Report, and aircrew training guides. NOTE: MAJCOMS may direct the
use of different training documentation systems (e.g. TIMS/GTIMS or other electronic
programs), forms and standards. In this case, the guidance in this chapter does not imply the
need for duplicate training documentation and MAJCOM-specific guidance takes precedence.
   6.1.1. Initiate a training folder, AF Form 4022 (or MAJCOM equivalent), for formal training
   (either at formal school or in-unit), mission qualification, special mission qualification or
   certification training, in-unit upgrade program to the next higher crew qualification,
   qualification or re-qualification training (either at formal school or in-unit), or for any
   corrective action or additional training (unless otherwise noted in this instruction).
       6.1.1.1. The unit operations officer may waive the training folder requirement if
       corrective action or additional training is limited. If initiated, the instructor or flight
       examiner who evaluated the aircrew member's performance will enter comments
       pertinent to the training deficiency on AF Form 4023. Use the existing training folder for
       end-of-course evaluations that result in additional training.
       6.1.1.2. At the unit commander's discretion, training folders for an individual undergoing
       more than one training program in a short period of time may combine all training into
       one AF Form 4022.
   6.1.2. Access to Training Records. Squadrons will maintain the training folders for their
   personnel in a location readily accessible to instructors and supervisory personnel. The
   trainee may review his or her folder at any time.
   6.1.3. Instructor Procedures. The instructor or trainer will review the training folder, to
   include AF Forms 4023 and 4024 or the training guide, prior to all training periods. Those
   areas not previously accomplished or those, in which crewmembers require additional
   training, will be noted for possible inclusion during the current training period.
   6.1.4. Training Folder Review. Operations officers will review active training folders
   quarterly, and flight commanders or squadron training representatives will conduct a monthly
   review. Monthly and quarterly reviews will be annotated on AF Form 4023 or in the training
   guide.
   6.1.5. Completion of Training. Upon completion of training, an AF Form 4025 will be
   generated. The original will be placed in the completed AF Form 4022 and a facsimile will
   be placed in Section V of the student‘s permanent training folder.
       6.1.5.1. Disposition of Training Records. All squadron training offices will retain all AF
       Form 4022s contents until one year after training close out and then return them to the
       crewmember. No unit will insert AF Forms 4022, 4023, 4024, 4025 or training guides
AFI11-2HC-130V1 16 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                              55


       into FEFs. Refer to the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
       https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/ afrims/rims.cfm for further guidance.
       6.1.5.2. Transfer of FTU Training Records. Formal schools will send AF Form 4022 (or
       MAJCOM equivalent) with all training records to the trainee's gaining unit. Squadron
       commanders will review formal school training records and enter appropriate comments
       on the training guide progress record or AF Form 4023.
   6.1.6. For purposes of training documentation, ―classroom only‖ training conducted at the
   unit should be identified as Academic Training (AT). Ground Training (GT) will be
   considered all academic training conducted outside the classroom. Academic training
   conducted while performing flying duties will be documented as Flying Training.
   6.1.7. AF Form 4022 Aircrew Training Folder Closure. The Training Folder is considered
   closed upon successful completion of the final event required by the training program. Final
   training events include flight evaluation; instructor validation of training (i.e. "sign-off"
   flight); and/or Squadron Commander Certification.
6.2. Instructions for AF Form 4022. This form is a folder constructed of cardstock paper. The
inside covers have tables for documenting training. AF Forms 4023, 4024, and 4025 and
additional information (waivers, memorandums, etc.) will be attached through the centered holes

      regressed or progress is unsatisfactory.
   6.4.9. Total Number Required. Indicates the total repetitions of an event or task required by
   the course syllabus.
   6.4.10. Total Number Accomplished. Total of the number of repetitions actually
   accomplished.
   6.4.11. Required Proficiency Level (RPL). RPL for the specific event and task. Each event
   and task will have a performance standard designated for the required proficiency level the
   crewmember will achieve. In addition, each event and task may have (optional) a knowledge
   standard designated and used in the same manner as a performance standard. The standards
   for specific events are either listed in the applicable master task list (MTL) and evaluation
   standards document (ESD) for each weapon system or identified in this instruction. For
   those weapons systems that do not have any RPL listing, all events will have an RPL of "3"
   for performance and "C" for knowledge (if knowledge standards are used in addition to
   performance standards). EXCEPTION: One-time events required for familiarization and
   not listed in the MTL and ESD or specific weapon system instruction will not have
   performance and knowledge standard assigned. Performance and knowledge standards are
   listed in Table 6.1
      6.4.11.1. Regression. Once a crewmember has received ―P‖ for an event, the only
      subsequent grade allowed for that event is either ―P‖ or ―U‖. Regression occurs when a
      maneuver is graded ―U‖ after having achieved ―P‖ in the same task. Regression from a
      ―P‖ to a ―U‖ requires an explanation in the student‘s training folder (AF Form 4023).
      The overall grade is at the instructor‘s discretion. For regression, the student will re-
      obtain proficiency prior to the end of the block of training in order to be recommended
      for a checkride (when applicable) or certification (when applicable).
      6.4.11.2. Proficiency Advance. In order to recommend a crewmember for a checkride
      (when applicable) or certification (associated with completion of training), the final grade
      for each event will meet the Required Proficiency Level (RPL) and the total number
      accomplished will normally meet or exceed the Total Number Required. EXCEPTION:
      Highly proficient crewmembers may be ―proficiency advanced‖ and the total number
      accomplished may be less than the Total Number Required.

Table 6.1. Event and Task Performance Standards.
Code Performance is:              Definition:
 1 Extremely Limited              Individual can do most activities only after being told or shown how.
 2 Partially Proficient           Individual can do most of the behaviors, but not necessarily to the

               FLYING TRAINING SORTIE AND EVENT DEFINITIONS

NOTE: Mission Copilot refers to MPD pilots who have not completed pilot upgrade
qualification.
A3.1. Sortie Definitions:
   A3.1.1. Basic Sortie [SX23]. Sortie must be flown on an HC-130 aircraft. Log basic sorties
   on local or operational missions that include appropriate pre-mission planning; preflight
   according to flight publications; preparation of performance, take-off and landing data;
   weather and crew/passenger briefings, flight plan filing, and post-mission procedures.
   Additional requirements by crew position are as follows:
       A3.1.1.1. Pilots will complete a takeoff and landing.
       A3.1.1.2. Navigators will monitor a departure and approach. If more than one qualified
       navigator is on a flight, each may obtain sortie credit on the same flight provided each
       one occupies the navigator position, maintains a log, performs navigator duties, and
              meets the requirements of the Basic Sortie criteria.
       A3.1.1.3. Flight Engineers, Loadmasters, and AMSS may credit any type of mission
       actually flown. Two crew members may log a sortie on the same mission if the applicable
       requirements of the Basic Sortie criteria are met.
       A3.1.1.4. All. Log only one Basic Sortie per mission.
   A3.1.2. Local Proficiency Sortie (LPS) [SX10]. A local training mission for BAQ,
   transition and emergency procedures. Fly maneuvers under the direct supervision of an IP.
   IPs are not required to fly with another IP to credit this event and need not accomplish all
   events on a single sortie. Complete all maneuvers to an acceptable level of proficiency as
   determined by the IP. Aircraft commanders should emphasize left-seat flying duties;
   however, they may fly in the right seat for proficiency. Mission copilots maintaining a left
   seat basic qualification will fly this event from the left seat to log currency. Complete all
   maneuvers to an acceptable level of proficiency as determined by the IP to log the LPS.
   Should the LPS be incomplete for weather or aircraft malfunction, the instructor will
   determine whether the entire LPS will be re-accomplished or just the incomplete events.
   Credit the LPS upon completion of the last event. A minimum of one hour actual flying time
   is required to log the LPS. When conditions permit, windmill taxi starts and simulated three
   engine takeoffs may be practiced (demonstrated to mission copilots in MPD Legacy
   progression). As the absolute minimum, conduct the following maneuvers: NOTES: Unit
   commanders may add to the following minimum LPS sortie criteria. See AFI 11-2HC-
   130V3 for additional information training policy and restrictions.      EXCEPTION: ARC
