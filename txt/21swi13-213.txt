                                            Chapter 3

                          VEHICLE OPERATING PROCEDURES

3.1. Policy. Prior to entering the airfield, operators will ensure their vehicles are in a safe and
reliable mechanical condition. Personnel will understand standard traffic flow procedures,
including driving lane locations, mandatory stop and yield signs, accident reporting and vehicle
operations on the airfield.
   3.1.1. AIRCRAFT WILL ALWAYS HAVE THE RIGHT-OF-WAY OVER ALL
   VEHICLES. NEVER CROSS THE PATH OF A MOVING AIRCRAFT. When
   yielding to aircraft move to an area at least 25 feet away from the wing tip of the aircraft and
   bring the vehicle to a complete stop. Always wait until a taxiing aircraft has cleared your
   path before proceeding and pass no closer than 200 feet to the rear.
3.2. PAFB Airfield (Attachment 4):
   3.2.1. Entry points: The PAFB ramp has 16 gates. All gates leading to the ramp are kept
   closed. NOTE: During increased Force Protection Conditions (FPCONs) it may be
   necessary to limit access to just one gate, check with AMOPS to verify which airfield
   gates are open during increased FPCONs. Coordinate with Security Forces and
   AMOPS prior to opening any gates not listed below.
       3.2.1.1. Gate 1: Open 0600L-2200L. (Remote gate opener required)
       3.2.1.2. Gate 6: Open 0600L-2200L. (Remote gate opener required)
       3.2.1.3. Gate 7: Open 0600L-2200L. (Remote gate opener required)
       3.2.1.4. Gate 8: Open 0600L-2200L. (Requires cipher code)
       3.2.1.5. Gate 9: Open 0600L-2200L. (302 AW Entrance Only)
   3.2.2. Traffic lane: There is a marked two-way traffic lane that runs Northwest/Southeast,
   parallel to the hangars, from Gate 1 to the Southeast end of the 302 AW parking ramp
   (Attachment 4). The markings consist of double solid yellow line boundaries on both sides
   and a dashed yellow centerline. The ramp Southeast of the 302 AW parking ramp is
   unmarked. Use caution between Hangars 140 and 133 due to Aero Club activity. Also use
   caution in front of Building 122 due to Distinguished Visitor (DV) activity.
       3.2.2.1. Extreme caution will be used while operating a vehicle within the DV aircraft
       operating area in front of Building 122 (parking rows “I” through “K”). Protocol will
       brief DV pick-up drivers and baggage truck drivers on operations in this area.
       3.2.2.2. Aircraft with wingspans greater than a Gulfstream IV and utilizing parking
       spots next to the traffic lane in Restricted Area 2 do not meet required lateral clearance
       criteria with moving vehicles in the traffic lane. The following procedures will be
       followed when an aircraft is moving within 40 feet of the driving lane adjacent to
       Restricted Area 2:
           3.2.2.2.1. Vehicle operators in the traffic lane will come to a complete stop at least
           40 feet from operations involving a moving aircraft and wait until the aircraft is
           completely stopped prior to proceeding. Vehicle operators will hold their position
21SWI13-213 15 APRIL 2013                                                                        17


         until directed by a marshaller if the aircraft gets within 40 feet after they are initially
         stopped. NOTE: The entire PAFB ramp consists of 20 x 20 feet concrete
         slabs/blocks. Counting 2 blocks is an easy way to identify 40 feet.
         3.2.2.2.2. All transient aircraft will be escorted by a “Follow Me” vehicle any time
         they are parking on the PAFB ramp. Wing walkers will be used at the discretion of
         the Aircraft Commander and/or Transient Alert personnel.
     3.2.2.3. There are four stop signs located along the traffic lane at critical junctures to aid
     in avoidance of taxiing aircraft and other vehicles approaching from blind intersections:
         3.2.2.3.1. Either side of Hangar 140.
         3.2.2.3.2. Hangar 133 (Aero Club).
         3.2.2.3.3. Hangar 119.
     3.2.2.4. Vehicle operators traveling in the traffic lane have the right-of-way over
     operators entering the traffic lane. Operators leaving the traffic lane will signal before
     making a turn to their destination.
     3.2.2.5. Vehicle operators will yield to emergency vehicles when approaching the Fire
     Lane.
  3.2.3. Traffic flow: Vehicle operators will not travel diagonally across the PAFB ramp.
  Travel either parallel or perpendicular to the traffic lane and make all turns at 90° angles.
  There are very few painted lines on the ramp. As a guide, follow the seams in the concrete
  slabs.
  3.2.4. Restricted Areas: There are two restricted areas (Attachment 4) on the PAFB ramp
  that require an automated entry control card with areas 2 & 4 marked on it to gain access.
  These restricted areas are marked by a solid red line and will be entered through the entry
  control points depicted in Attachment 4. NOTE: Issuance of an AF IMT 483 does not
  authorize access to the restricted areas. Area 2 encompasses parking rows “C” through
  “H” and has two entry control points. Area 4 encompasses parking rows “M” through
  “V” and has three entry control points.
  3.2.5. Controlled Movement Area boundary: There is a Movement Area boundary marking
  (one parallel solid and one dashed yellow line) painted the entire length of the south end of
  the PAFB ramp where it adjoins to Taxiway B (Attachment A5.3).
  Authorization/certification from COS Airport Operations, a SIDA badge and positive two-
  way radio communication with the FAA Control Tower are required to cross this boundary
  and drive on Taxiway B. DO NOT CROSS THIS BOUNDARY LINE WITHOUT
  PERMISSION FROM TOWER.
     3.2.5.1. Vehicles and personnel requiring temporary access to the movement area, but do
     not have authorization, will be escorted by an individual who has a COS Airport SIDA
     badge with escort endorsements.
  3.2.6. . PAFB Airfield vehicle operations:
     3.2.6.1. Drivers operating on the PAFB Airfield will be certified and have a current AF
     IMT 483 in their possession or they will be escorted by a certified airfield driver.
18                                                             21SWI13-213 15 APRIL 2013


     3.2.6.2. Airfield orientation will be maintained at all times to protect aircraft and
     personnel. Any operator who becomes disorientated will immediately stop their vehicle
     out of the way of aircraft, contact their work center or AMOPS and request an escort off
     the airfield (also contact Tower if within the CMA).
     3.2.6.3. Two-way radio communication with the FAA control tower is not required when
     operating a vehicle on the PAFB Airfield. It is required when operating a vehicle in the
     CMA (runways/taxiways).
     3.2.6.4. Night and inclement weather driving conditions: During periods of extremely
     low visibility airfield driving will be limited to mission essential duties only.
     3.2.6.5. Speed limits:
        3.2.6.5.1. General Purpose Vehicles – 15 MPH
        3.2.6.5.2. Special Purpose Vehicles or vehicles towing one maintenance stand – 10
        MPH
        3.2.6.5.3. All vehicles are limited to 5 MPH when:
            3.2.6.5.3.1. Operating within the aircraft parking areas.
            3.2.6.5.3.2. Within 25 feet of an aircraft.
            3.2.6.5.3.3. Towing aircraft.
            3.2.6.5.3.4. Towing two or more maintenance stands.
        3.2.6.5.4. During actual emergencies, emergency vehicle operators may exceed the
        above speed limits, with caution, and only when necessary to save lives and/or
        property. During exercises/training, emergency vehicle operators are not authorized
        to exceed 15 MPH under any circumstances.
        3.2.6.5.5. Snow and ice removal equipment may be driven at the recommended
        speeds (30-40 MPH), depending on snow depths, to perform snow and ice removal
        from the airfield. Significantly reduced speeds (5 MPH or slowest possible speed that
        equipment is effective) and caution will be used within 25 feet of aircraft.
        3.2.6.5.6. AMOPS vehicle(s) may be driven at the recommended speeds (20-30
        MPH) when conducting Airfield Condition Reading checks.
        3.2.6.5.7. To accommodate the optimum safe taxiing speed of aircraft, guiding
        “Follow Me” vehicle operators can exceed the normal 15 MPH airfield speed limit.
     3.2.6.6. Approaching an aircraft: All operators will approach a parked aircraft with the
     driver’s side of the vehicle towards the aircraft. The approach will always be made from
     the side or front of an aircraft. NOTE: Operators may approach the aircraft from the
     non-driver’s side when delivering ground power units.
        3.2.6.6.1. Except for servicing operations, no vehicle operator will park or travel
        closer than 25 feet to the front and side of an aircraft or less than 200 feet from the
        rear of an aircraft whose engines are running or about to be started. (For C-5, C-17,
        and B-747 aircraft, no vehicle will be driven closer than 500 feet behind aircraft with
        engines operating or being started.) NOTE: An aircraft with its engines running
21SWI13-213 15 APRIL 2013                                                                      19


        or about to start can be identified by spinning propellers, engine exhaust and/or
        position lights illuminated.
        3.2.6.6.2. During aircraft engine runs, vehicle operators will observe the directions of
        the ground observer and wait until instructed to proceed.
        3.2.6.6.3. Vehicle operators performing on-the-job (OJT) training for airfield duties
        will not drive a vehicle within 50 feet of an aircraft. This restriction does not apply to
        fire fighting vehicles, vehicles towing aircraft, vehicles loading/unloading materials,
        handling equipment, and aircraft servicing vehicles. In all cases personnel
        performing OJT will be qualified to operate the vehicle and a qualified instructor will
        accompany them.
        3.2.6.6.4. Do not operate vehicles within 50 feet of aircraft being refueled/defueled
        or in the process of Liquid Oxygen (LOX) servicing.
        3.2.6.6.5. No vehicle will be driven between a “Follow-Me” vehicle and an aircraft.
     3.2.6.7. Parked aircraft: Do not operate a motorized vehicle under any part of an aircraft.
     Vehicles will not be driven between the wing tips of aircraft parked on adjacent spots.
     Vehicles will not be parked in the immediate vicinity (25 feet) of any aircraft, except as
     authorized for operations such as loading or unloading, servicing or towing. Also, do not
     back or drive vehicles directly toward any aircraft, except as authorized in certain
     loading, unloading, or fueling operations. In these cases, place pre-positioned wheel
     chocks between the aircraft and the approaching vehicle to keep vehicles from striking
     the aircraft. During these operations, spotters will be used to guide vehicles within 10
     feet of the aircraft and chocks will be pre-positioned.
        3.2.6.7.1. In no case will an operator drive a vehicle closer than 10 feet, except when
        servicing requirements dictate. Pre-positioned chocks and a spotter will be used to
        prevent the vehicle from striking the aircraft.
     3.2.6.8. Emergency and exercise operations: During an aircraft emergency or exercise
     situation all vehicle operators not directly responding to the situation will keep away.
     Stop and yield the right-of-way to emergency vehicles.
        3.2.6.8.1. Vehicle operators will not drive between emergency vehicles and
        emergency aircraft, whether stationary or in-trail.
        3.2.6.8.2. Emergency vehicle operators will turn emergency lights on when
        responding to an emergency. Non emergency vehicle operators will immediately
        yield the right-of-way to emergency vehicles with rotating emergency lights in
        operation. This includes AMOPS, ambulance, fire/crash, police, and safety vehicles.
        3.2.6.8.3. Vehicle operators parked near an emergency aircraft will move their
        vehicles 300 feet away from the aircraft as soon as possible and before the arrival of
        emergency vehicles.
     3.2.6.9. Vehicle lights: Do not approach the front of any moving aircraft with headlights
     on at night. Avoid approaching the front of an aircraft being towed at night. If
     unavoidable, position the vehicle in a location that is well clear of the aircraft’s intended
     taxi route (25 feet from wingtip), with headlights turned off, until the aircraft has passed.
     This will ensure the aircrew will not be blinded or have their night vision impaired by
20                                                               21SWI13-213 15 APRIL 2013


     vehicle headlights. Leave parking lights on so location is known. NOTE: Operators of
     vehicles equipped with Daytime Running Lights (DRL) will exercise extreme
     caution during the hours of darkness. DRL should be turned off if possible when
     approaching aircraft. In the event DRLs cannot be turned off, position the vehicle
     in an area that will not be a hazard to aircraft, turn the vehicle off with the hazard
     lights flashing, and wait for the aircraft to pass. Never point headlights toward
     taxiing or towed aircraft at night.
        3.2.6.9.1. During the period from one-half hour before sunset to one-half hour after
        sunrise, all operators of vehicles in motion will use headlights, not parking lights.
        3.2.6.9.2. During periods of reduced visibility (i.e., darkness, smoke, rain, fog, or
        snow) operators of vehicles parked on the airfield will use rotating beacon or
        emergency flashers. If the vehicle is not equipped with a rotating beacon or
        emergency flashers, use parking lights.
            3.2.6.9.2.1. When visibility is less than 100 feet, vehicles will not be operated on
            the airfield (except emergency vehicles if necessary).
     3.2.6.10. Airfield parking (in other than designated parking areas). Temporary parking
     on the airfield is allowed if the vehicle is properly attended. Unless mission requirements
     dictate, vehicles will not be parked within 25 feet to the front or 200/500 feet to the rear
     of aircraft. Vehicles parked to the side of an aircraft will be located clear of the wing tips
     and will be clearly visible to personnel in the cockpit. Positioning and parking vehicles
     will be accomplished IAW provisions established in AFMAN 24-306, Chapter 25.
        3.2.6.10.1. Vehicles will not be parked pointed towards an aircraft. Park in front of
        or behind the aircraft, perpendicular to the fuselage. This will eliminate the
        possibility of striking the aircraft if the vehicle inadvertently rolls backward or
        forward. Vehicles will be parked so departure can be accomplished without backing.
        3.2.6.10.2. Do not park a vehicle within 50 feet of any fuel spill, refueling operation
        or LOX operation.
        3.2.6.10.3. Vehicles will not be parked in front of taxiing aircraft under any
        circumstance.
        3.2.6.10.4. When the driver’s seat is vacated, turn off the ignition, leave the keys in
        the ignition, set the brake and place the gear lever in park (automatic) or reverse
        (standard shift).
            3.2.6.10.4.1. Aircraft-servicing support vehicles that require the vehicle engine to
            operate as the power source for auxiliary components may be left unattended
            while the engine is running. When the driver’s seat is not occupied, set the
            parking brake and chock the rear wheels.
            3.2.6.10.4.2. Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) tow vehicles may be placed in
            neutral and left running while the driver completes hookup operations. Operators
            will shut off the vehicle, set the parking brake, and place the vehicle in park or
            reverse if they do not drive off with the AGE equipment immediately following
            hookup.
            3.2.6.10.4.3. If emergency vehicles must remain in operation at the scene of an
21SWI13-213 15 APRIL 2013                                                                      21


            emergency, operators may park with the engine running. When the driver’s seat
            is unoccupied, the operator will set the parking brake, place the transmission in
            neutral or park and chock the rear wheels.
        3.2.6.10.5. Use chocks to secure all vehicles and wheeled equipment that do not have
        an integral braking system when they are left parked unattended on the airfield. Use
        chocks to secure all explosive loaded vehicles any time the driver is not behind the
        wheel.
        3.2.6.10.6. Vehicles will not be left unattended within 200 feet of Taxiway B
        centerline or within the vehicle traffic lane.
     3.2.6.11. Aircraft towing: The tow vehicle will be driven by an authorized and qualified
     driver. There will be a qualified person in the aircraft cockpit to provide braking during
     all towing operations. Aircraft will not be towed at more than 5 miles per hour. Wing
     walkers will be used during towing operations when there is less than 25 feet of wing tip
     clearance to other aircraft or obstacles and during reduced visibility conditions.
     3.2.6.12. Aircraft Refueling:
        3.2.6.12.1. Fuel trucks will not be parked closer than 20 feet to the aircraft fuel intake
        or air vents, nor within 10 feet of any part of the aircraft.
        3.2.6.12.2. Fuel trucks will not be driven or parked under any part of an aircraft.
        3.2.6.12.3. Leave fuel truck’s driver side door slightly ajar while servicing aircraft in
        case there is an emergency and/or the vehicle must be moved quickly.
     3.2.6.13. Unit owned bicycle use: Government employees, when on official business,
     may ride a unit owned bicycle in the Traffic Lane that runs parallel to the hangars. Unit
     owned bicycles will have a permanently affixed plaque identifying the unit, and adhere to
     the same rules of the road as vehicles.
        3.2.6.13.1. Due to their low visibility profile, unit owned bicycles are
        PROHIBITED on the aircraft parking areas of the airfield. EXCEPTION: 302
        AW may operate unit owned bicycles on their portion of the airfield.
        3.2.6.13.2. Unit owned bicycles will be equipped with an operational headlamp
        (turned on) and reflectors or reflector tape during night operations.
        3.2.6.13.3. Unit owned bicycles will be positioned so as not to impede the traffic
        flow of aircraft or motor vehicles any time they are parked day or night.
     3.2.6.14. Unit owned motorcycle, moped and scooter use is permitted on the Traffic
     Lane only. These vehicles will have operational headlights and brake lights when
     operated at night. All motorcycles, mopeds, and scooters will be unit owned, have a
     permanently affixed plaque identifying the unit, and adhere to the same rules of the road
     as vehicles.
        3.2.6.14.1. Unit owned motorcycles, mopeds, and scooters are PROHIBITED on the
        airfield aircraft parking areas due to their low visibility profiles and greater speed
        capabilities.
22                                                              21SWI13-213 15 APRIL 2013


     3.2.6.15. Unit owned electrical or gasoline powered golf-type carts or similar utility
     vehicles (21 SFS all terrain vehicles) are allowed on all areas of the PAFB Airfield.
     They will be equipped with forward and rear lamps if operated at night.
     3.2.6.16. Cell phone usage: Operators will not use cell phones (including “hands free”
     devices) while their vehicle is in motion on the airfield. Operators will park their vehicle
     out of the way of aircraft and vehicle traffic prior to placing or answering a call.
        3.2.6.16.1. Cell phones will not be used near aircraft being serviced with fuel or
        oxygen within the distances listed below unless otherwise specified in the appropriate
        Technical Order or guidance for the particular operation.
            3.2.6.16.1.1. Within 50 feet of any pressurized aircraft fuel or oxygen servicing
            components.
            3.2.6.16.1.2. Within 25 feet of any aircraft fuel vent outlet during fuel transfer.
            3.2.6.16.1.3. Within 10 feet of any aircraft fuel vent outlet
     3.2.6.17. Foreign Object Damage/Debris (FOD): Vehicles on the airfield are a major
     source of foreign objects that damage aircraft tires and are ingested into jet engines with
     potentially disastrous results. All airfield personnel share the responsibility for FOD
     control. In order to help prevent FOD, the following precautions will be taken by all
     personnel on the airfield:
        3.2.6.17.1. Before entering the airfield from any access point, all operators are
        required to stop, check tires and inspect vehicles for loose objects. Once tires are
        checked, roll forward 18 to 24 inches and check the remaining exposed tire. A
        flashlight will be used for the inspection between sunset and sunrise. All vehicle
        operators will remove FOD from the airfield whenever observed. FOD is everyone's
        responsibility.
        3.2.6.17.2. Ensure that all equipment carried in/on a vehicle is properly stored and
        secured.
            3.2.6.17.2.1. Close truck tailgates and tool compartments prior to entering and
            while driving on the airfield.
        3.2.6.17.3. Operators will stay on paved surfaces to the maximum extent possible. If
        required to drive off the paved surface, do so by the shortest route possible and
        perform a complete FOD check upon re-entry to the paved surfaces.
        3.2.6.17.4. When exiting a construction area onto the airfield, operators will stop,
        inspect vehicle's tires and remove any potential foreign object material.
        3.2.6.17.5. Remove FOD from the airfield when it is observed. Contact AMOPS if a
        sweeper is required.
     3.2.6.18. Vehicle Traction Device Limitations:
        3.2.6.18.1. Studded tires are not authorized on the PAFB Airfield under any
        condition.
21SWI13-213 15 APRIL 2013                                                                        23


           3.2.6.18.2. Use of tire chains is authorized on the airfield when extreme snow or ice
           conditions prevail and only when approved by the Airfield Manager, Safety, and Civil
           Engineering. Remove tire chains immediately when no longer required.
3.2.6.19. Tower light gun signals: All vehicles that operate on the PAFB Airfield will have a
AFVA 11-240 decal, Airport Signs and Markings or FAA Form 5280-7, Airport Signs and
Markings. The decal will be in plain view of the driver. All PAFB Airfield vehicle operators

         REPORTING, ENFORCEMENT AND VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES

4.1. Policy. AIRFIELD DRIVIING SAFETY IS PARAMOUNT TO SUPPORTING THE
MISSION AND VIOLATIONS WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. The Airfield Manager is the
governing authority concerning airfield driving violations IAW AFI 13-213 and will determine
appropriate actions based upon the seriousness of the violation. The following policies are used
only as guidelines and are not intended to cover all situations.
4.2. AOA/Controlled Movement Area Violations.
   4.2.1. A Controlled Movement Area violation is an airfield infraction caused by vehicles or
   pedestrians entering the Airport Operating Area/Controlled Movement Area of the airfield
   without specific Control Tower approval. This definition also includes runway incursions.
       4.2.1.1. A runway incursion is a Controlled Movement Area violation event that involves
       the incorrect presence of an aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface
       designated for the landing and take-off of aircraft. For the purpose of this instruction the
       protected area is the same as the Controlled Movement Area. These violations are further
       classified into three operational categories (Operational Error, Pilot Deviation,
       Vehicle/Pedestrian).
   4.2.2. A potential for a serious mishap exists if a vehicle enters a runway or taxiway without
   proper clearance. The FAA can impose up to a $10,000 fine for an incursion. Therefore, no
   one will proceed onto a runway or taxiway without two-way radio contact with, and approval
   from the FAA Control Tower, a valid badge, or under the escort of personnel possessing a
   SIDA badge with escort endorsements.
   4.2.3. Reporting AOA/CMA (runways, taxiways) violations is the responsibility of the COS
   Airport Operations Division.
   4.2.4. COS Operations will report any violations involving PAFB personnel to AMOPS and
   21 SW/SE (Flight Safety).
       4.2.4.1. AMOPS and 21 SW/SE will assign all runway incursions an operational
       category (Operational Error, Pilot Deviation, Vehicle/Pedestrian) for trend analysis.
       4.2.4.2. The Airfield Manager or designated individual will take immediate actions to
       correct the problem or apply interim control measures.
   4.2.5. The FAA mandates use of the following Forms to report violations on civil airfields:
       4.2.5.1. Tower will use FAA Form 8020-24, Preliminary Vehicle or Pedestrian
       Deviation Report, for violations that adversely impact flight operations (arrivals,
       departures, etc) and forward to AMOPS and 21 SW/SE for action.
       4.2.5.2. Tower will use FAA Form 8020-24, Preliminary Vehicle or Pedestrian
       Deviation Report, for violations or incidents that did not impact aircraft operations.
       AMOPS will also document the same information on AF IMT 457, USAF Hazard
       Report, and forward both forms to 21 SW/SE for action.
 28                                                               21SWI13-213 15 APRIL 2013


   4.2.6. The USAF mandates use of the following forms to report runway intrusion violations
   involving AF personnel or aircraft:
       4.2.6.1. Runway Intrusion Not Involving Aircraft: Use AF IMT 457, USAF Hazard
       Report.
       4.2.6.2. Runway Intrusion Involving Aircraft: Use AF IMT 651, Hazardous Air Traffic
       Report (HATR).
       4.2.6.3. The Airfield Manager will maintain a copy of the AF IMT 651s/457s, actions
       taken, results and supporting documentation in accordance with Air Force RDS, Table
       13-06, Rule 15.00 (See AFI 91-202 and AFI 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and
       Reports).
   4.2.7. Minimum penalties for PAFB Airfield and AOA/Controlled Movement Area
   violations:
       4.2.7.1. General driving rules violations or unauthorized access attempts on the PAFB
       Airfield will be reported to AMOPS as soon as the incident occurs. The Airfield
       Manager will coordinate with 21 SW/SFS, 21SW/SEF and the Airfield Operations flight
       commander to determine the proper method of reporting the incident and to decide which
       agency will investigate.
       4.2.7.2. First Violation: The Airfield Manager or designated representative will revoke
       the individual’s airfield driving license (AF IMT 483) for a minimum of 30 days and
       notify their commander. Depending on the seriousness of the violation, the individual’s
       airfield driving privileges might not be reinstated. If privileges are to be reinstated, the
       individual will be retrained and recertified by their unit ADPM.
       4.2.7.3. Second Violation: A second offense will result in a minimum of 90 days
       suspension. The individual's airfield driving privileges will be reinstated at the discretion
       of the Airfield Manager or upon recommendation by the individual's commander.
       Permanent suspension could result based upon the seriousness of the violation.
       4.2.7.4. Third Violation: A third offense will result in an active duty military member’s
       airfield driving privileges being revoked for the remainder of their assignment at PAFB.
       All other personnel (DoD Civilians, ANG, AFRC, etc.) will have their privileges revoked
       for two years or at the discretion of the 21 SW/CC.
   4.2.8. All AOA/Controlled Movement Area violations, regardless of impact on flight safety,
   will be briefed at the Airfield Operations Board and documented in the minutes.
       4.2.8.1. The briefing will provide a detailed description (What, When, Where and How,
       type vehicle/aircraft involved and action taken to prevent a repeat incident) and highlight
       any trends.
   4.2.9. Any accident on the airfield will be reported to the Airfield Manger, 21 SW/SE, 21
   SFS/CC, and 21 OSS/CC.
4.3. Suspension of Airfield Driving Privileges:
   4.3.1. In all cases of suspension or revocation, the Airfield Manager will take possession of
   the individual’s AF IMT 483.
21SWI13-213 15 APRIL 2013                                                                         29


   4.3.2. The Airfield Manager will send a letter to the individual’s supervisor, unit ADPM,
   Commander, 21 OG/CC and 21 SW/CC informing them of the airfield driving violation and
   suspension of airfield driving privileges.
   4.3.3. For reinstatement of airfield driving privileges following a suspension, an individual
   will complete remedial training under the guidance of their unit ADPM.
      4.3.3.1. The remedial training consists of re-accomplishing all initial training
      requirements as specified in this instruction. After all training requirements are met and
      the individual passes the written test(s), a new AF IMT 483 will be issued.
   4.3.4. If the individual is needed to support a mission on the airfield, their commander may
   submit a letter requesting reinstatement of airfield driving privileges prior to expiration of the
   suspension period.
      4.3.4.1. The letter will be on official letterhead and addressed to the Airfield Manager
      (21 OSS/OSAA). It will explain the reason(s) why the individual should retain their
      airfield driving privileges and state the driver has been counseled by their supervisor
      about the violation. IAW AFI 13-213, the 21 SW/CC is the only approval authority for
      early re-instatement. The Airfield Manager will submit the letter to the 21 SW/CC for
      consideration. The individual’s AF IMT 483 will be returned upon completion of
      training requirements and reinstatement of driving privileges by the 21 SW/CC.
4.4. Civilian Drivers License Suspension.
   4.4.1. If an individual’s civilian driver’s license or base driving privileges are suspended or
   revoked, the unit commander will also suspend or revoke the individual’s airfield driving
   privileges.
      4.4.1.1. Confiscate their AF IMT 483 and notify the individual’s ADPM and the Airfield
      Manager in writing.
      4.4.1.2. The Airfield Manager will take possession of the individual’s AF IMT 483.
      Upon reinstatement of the individual’s civilian driver’s license or base driving privileges,

                                   QUALITY CONTROL

7.1. Spot Checks. AMOPS will conduct spot checks on the PAFB ramp three times per week.
   7.1.1. Spot checks consist of randomly pulling a vehicle over and checking the operator for
   valid AF IMT 483, current AF Visual Aids (i.e., AFVA 11-240, AFVA 13-222, AFVA 13-
   221). AMOPS personnel will also observe traffic for general safety issues and traffic rules
   violations. NOTE: When AMOPS is working one person on a shift it is acceptable to
   conduct a spot check by stopping individuals as they enter AMOPS from the flightline
   and checking their AF IMT 483 for currency (vehicle will also be checked if
   conveniently parked closeby).
   7.1.2. AMOPS will document spot checks three times per week on the daily events log, AF
   3616. Spot checks will be reported in the "status of airfield driving" section of the quarterly
   AOB.
   7.1.3. Violations detected during spot checks will be reported in writing to the 21 OSS/CC,
   individual’s unit commander, and ADPM.
7.2. Unit Airfield Driving Program Inspections. Every unit program will be inspected by
AMOPS once every calendar year using the inspection checklist in Attachment 7.
   7.2.1. Units failing an annual inspection will be re-evaluated 30 days from the date of the
   failed inspection.
      7.2.1.1. Program inspection failures are a subjective determination made by the AOF/CC
      and the Airfield Manager. Items that will be considered as program failures are safety
      violations (i.e., members driving on the airfield without a valid AF Form 483) and repeat
      write-ups.
   7.2.2. Inspection results will be provided to the unit commander and briefed at the quarterly
   AOB by the AOF/CC or designated representative.
