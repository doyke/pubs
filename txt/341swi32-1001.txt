                                     METHOD OF OPERATION

1.1. Conditions for Execution. This instruction is effective for planning and implementation when
weather conditions so dictate.

1.2. Operations to be Conducted. When snow or ice impede or create hazardous conditions for aircraft
or vehicular movement, necessary measures will be taken to remove or reduce the snow and/or ice from
the affected areas.

1.3. Key Assumptions. For this instruction to be effective, adequate equipment and manning must be
available to include seasonal over-hires.

1.4. Operational Constraints. Operations may be constrained by lack of over-hires and equipment
down for repair.

1.5. Operations Security (OPSEC):
    1.5.1. All actions directed by this instruction will take into consideration OPSEC in order to prevent
    enemy exploitation of information to gain an advantage. Realistic OPSEC requires conscientious
    security discipline at all levels of command and staff. Public affairs, deception, and operational
    requirements must be in agreement with the critical information. Review all attachments to ensure
    they comply with the desired degree of security. Consider the content of the instruction and resulting
    actions in execution.
    1.5.2. Instruction must provide the highest degree of security without degrading effectiveness.
    Known or suspected enemy awareness from previous operations and plans should be considered in
    determining OPSEC requirements. Procedures are then designed to eliminate suspect sources as feasi-
    ble, including such possible sources as job control communications.

1.6. Command Relationships. Established command relationships will remain in effect during the exe-
cution of this instruction.

1.7. Logistics Appraisal. This Instruction is logistically feasible within the assumptions and constraints
specified.

1.8. Personnel Appraisal. This plan is feasible within the assumptions and constraints specified.

                                    TASKED ORGANIZATIONS

2.1. General Situation:
   2.1.1. Priorities. A detailed listing of priorities will be established and approved by the S&IC Com-
   mittee in September of each year. See Chapter 5.
   2.1.2. S&IC Instruction. The 341st Mission Support Group Commander will be responsible for prep-
   aration of, or updating of, an S&IC Instruction. Snow and ice must not be permitted to accumulate in
   helicopter traffic areas to the extent it interferes with the base primary mission. The provisions of AFI
   38-203, Commercial Activities Program, will apply in determining the manpower resources to be uti-
   lized for S&IC/removal.
      2.1.2.1. Experience has shown a successful snow and ice instruction largely depends upon the
      techniques employed, numbers and types of equipment provided, and availability of trained per-
      sonnel to perform this task. As a general rule, equipment should be provided in numbers and types
      sufficient to cope with the weather conditions that may be encountered. (See Table of Allowance
      010 for S&IC vehicle allowances.)
      2.1.2.2. The S&IC Instruction incorporates the knowledge and experience gained from "freak"
      storms.
      2.1.2.3. As a minimum, a copy of this instruction including priorities for clearing will be fur-
      nished to the members of the S&IC Committee, and others concerned, as specified by the commit-
      tee chairperson.
   2.1.3. S&IC Committee. The committee will convene and be chaired by the 341st Space Wing Com-

       2.1.5.1. Select and allot priority to the largest lots adjacent to the main work areas.
       2.1.5.2. Consider temporary mass vehicle parking on athletic fields, unused portions of the air-
       field, paved or grass areas, etc. These emergency parking areas must be cleared and prepared prior
       to arrival of new shift. Parking must be controlled. Buses are used to transport personnel to and
       from required buildings or work areas until regular parking areas are opened for use.
    2.1.6. Support Units. Units required in the support of S&IC instruction as directed by the S&IC com-
    mittee will outline responsibilities for their unit in the base S&IC instruction. The responsibilities out-
    lined will only be those essential to support the instruction and not internal day-to-day operations or
    recall procedures that would better fit in a unit operating instruction.

2.2. Mission. The purpose and objective of this instruction is to establish priorities, responsibilities, and
procedures for S&IC on base and in the missile complex.
341SWI32-1001 10 MARCH 2004                                                                                 7

                            SNOW AND ICE CONTROL OPERATIONS

3.1. Airfield Snow Removal. Snow removal will be given priority over aircraft operations on the run-
way, when snow conditions would jeopardize the controlled movement area serviceability and cause the
installation to be closed to flying. To achieve this, close coordination and cooperation will be maintained
between SCC and helicopter operations. Alternate access to the controlled movement area, by S&IC
equipment and by aircraft, is necessary so that Malmstrom Air Force Base is in operational condition at
all times. Successful snow removal depends largely upon the ingenuity and good common sense of the
personnel concerned. The controlled movement area is defined as the area enclosed by orange cones.
   3.1.1. Snow removal operations will commence on the helicopter parking, taxiways, and helipads
   with the start of precipitation to achieve a continuous bare pavement.
   3.1.2. Entry/Reentry to Controlled Movement Area. Before entering or returning to the movement
   area, the snow removal supervisor will contact the 40 HF/ODO by phone or radio for clearance onto
   the controlled movement area for the equipment involved in snow removal operations and will inform
   40 HF/ODO if there is intent to deviate from the procedure described.
   3.1.3. At the beginning of a snowfall, snow removal equipment will commence operations starting at
   the hanger doors and work their way out to the taxiways, helipads, and the operational portion of the
   runway.
       3.1.3.1. Every effort will be made to obtain maximum productive time from each operator and
       piece of equipment. Sufficient personnel and equipment will be employed to ensure that fire lanes
       are open and the airfield is maintained in an operational status.
       3.1.3.2. Runway snow plowing operations will be performed utilizing methods and procedures
       proven from past experience to be the quickest and most economical. Due to existing wind condi-
       tion, normally the runway will be plowed one direction to the south and a back-pass made next to
       the lights into the adjacent field. Snow plowing operations under "no-wind" or "light snow" con-
       ditions will be performed by plowing from centerline of the runway to each side.
   3.1.4. In the event of an impending emergency operation, or normal landing of aircraft, the 40 HF/
   ODO will warn snow removal personnel on the controlled movement area by radio. If normal radio
   communications cannot be established, the 40 HF/ODO will blink the runway lights. The following
   actions apply:
       3.1.4.1. Operators of all snow equipment will clear from the movement area by the nearest hard
       surface and proceed 200 feet from helipad or slide area.
       3.1.4.2. Any snow removal equipment operating on the ramp and ramp taxiway will yield to taxi-
       ing aircraft.
   3.1.5. Augmentation crews, as required, will report to the SCC with adequate winter clothing, and
   will be utilized for shoveling snow from runway lights, taxiway lights, etc., as directed by the shift
   supervisor.
   3.1.6. Taxiways, under "no-wind" or "light-snow" conditions, will be plowed from the centerlines of
   taxiways to each side, with a back-pass, and snow then blown into adjacent field. In strong wind con-
   ditions, taxiways will be plowed in one direction from the windward side.
16                                                                     341SWI32-1001 10 MARCH 2004


     3.1.7. Snow removal operations will be accomplished by truck-mounted plows, sanders, graders,
     loaders, and sweepers as required.
     3.1.8. Safety during snow removal operations is paramount and will not be compromised.
     3.1.9. Snow will be moved from airfield lighting by hand, then excess snow around the area will be
     removed by snow removal equipment.
     3.1.10. Snow removal operation will cease when visibility is determined by the SCO or shift leader to
     be unsafe for further operation.
     3.1.11. Other airfield areas: Snow removal from the following areas is accomplished by the facility
     occupant or OPR by hand shoveling, small rotary blowers, and small tractor-mounted plows.
        3.1.11.1. Areas which cannot be safely cleared by using snow removal equipment designed for
        airfield use.
        3.1.11.2. Navigation Aids (NAVAIDS).

3.2. Snow Removal for Streets, Roads, and Parking Areas:
     3.2.1. All primary street intersections will be de-iced a distance of 40 feet on each side of each inter-
     section immediately after plowing as needed.
     3.2.2. Intersections will be de-iced prior to 0645 and 1600 hrs on normal duty days.
     3.2.3. Snow removal will be in accordance with assigned routes.

3.3. Other Snow Removal. The building custodian, using agency, housing occupant, and/or OPR will be
responsible for snow removal from:
     3.3.1. Sidewalks, driveways, loading docks, and porches.
     3.3.2. Fire hydrants.
     3.3.3. Overhead and sliding doors, vertical lifts, and swinging gates.

3.4. Missile Field Snow Removal. The purpose of this section is to specify the procedures, personnel,
and equipment necessary for snow removal operations in the missile complex, and to specify procedures
and method of operations to meet the additional snow removal requirements for removing snow from
behind the launch closure at LFs.
     3.4.1. Responsibility. The BCE is responsible for snow removal at the LFs when teams cannot gain
     access to the site with vehicles fully chained and snow depth is greater then 6 inches, and for notifying
     the Cascade County for snow removal requirements on public access roads. Also, BCE is responsible
     for correlation of the functions of CE with those of other organizations for the purpose of implement-
     ing snow removal operations and having the ability for continued 24-hour operation under the require-
     ments of this section. SCC will coordinate schedule with MMOC and ensure MMOC is kept informed
     of snow removal progress in the field.
     3.4.2. Pre-positioning of CE Personnel and Equipment:
        3.4.2.1. All snow removal support will respond from the support base. All available equipment
        and personnel will be operationally ready and standing by when not actually engaged in snow
        removal. Standby time will include time required for equipment maintenance.
341SWI32-1001 10 MARCH 2004                                                                           17


     3.4.2.2. In the event of a severe winter storm warning, all required equipment and personnel may
     be pre-positioned at MAFs nearest to priority snow removal request to await the storm, as deter-
     mined by the BCE. Caution should be used to keep required personnel on base to relieve snow
     removal crews after 5 days in the field to avoid crew fatigue. When extreme weather conditions
     exist, crew changeover will be conducted by 6-passenger pickups that are radio equipped. Crew
     changes will be made in midday to avoid icy conditions wherever the schedule allows.
     3.4.2.3. All pre-positioning of MAF snow equipment will be completed by 15 October.
  3.4.3. CE may require additional transportation to make crew changes.
  3.4.4. Equipment Maintenance. The transportation maintenance shop will be responsible for equip-
  ment that breaks down in the field. It will assume responsibility for repair. The equipment operator or
  SCC will inform vehicle dispatch of the location and type of malfunction of the broken equipment.

     maintaining contact with SCC and MMOC to the maximum extent possible.
     3.4.5.5. Equipment operators will ensure SCC, shift supervisors, and MMOC are informed of
     each arrival and departure of a crew or team at a missile complex. This may be accomplished by
     Radio-Telephone Patch-SIN Line at Soft Support Building or by radio. Call-ins are necessary to
     show work progress and/or status to enable supervisors to properly prepare a work assignment
     schedule.
  3.4.6. Pre-dispatches will be completed by the snow removal team chief and verified by the SCC.
  3.4.7. Rations and Quarters:
     3.4.7.1. During snow removal operations, food service personnel may be required to provide
     messing facilities at other than normal serving hours. Snow removal teams will provide one-hour
     advance notification.
     3.4.7.2. Box lunches may be required instead of normal messing.
     3.4.7.3. Quarters may occasionally be required for two to six individuals. MAFs will be given all
     the advance notice possible, prior to the arrival of personnel.
  3.4.8. Safety. Prior to departure from Malmstrom AFB, each snow removal crew will attend a safety
  briefing. Existing weather conditions, laws, regulations, instructions, current operation instructions
  (OI), and good common sense will determine the actions of personnel and the manner in which snow
  removal equipment is operated.
  3.4.9. Tools and Equipment:
18                                                                     341SWI32-1001 10 MARCH 2004


        3.4.9.1. Sufficient tools and equipment of a predetermined type and number will be located at
        each MAF snow removal center. These items will be pre-positioned at the same time as the vehi-
        cles.
        3.4.9.2. The shift leader will be responsible for the issue of tools to personnel and will account for
        such tools on AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.
     3.4.10. Snow Removal Procedures:
        3.4.10.1. Snow removal personnel will not accept or perform snow removal duties from any
        source other than the SCC. Emergency work will be assigned from the SCC.
        3.4.10.2. When removing snow within the MAFs and LFs, vehicle operators will take extreme
        care to avoid damage to the complex fixtures and snow removal equipment.

        tion of equipment and personnel.
        3.4.10.5. All sanding requests will be cleared through the SCC.
        3.4.10.6. Ice removal chemicals will not be used unless approved by the BCE.
        3.4.10.7. Facility managers located at the MAFs will be responsible for moving or having moved
        those vehicles that interfere with snow removal at the MAFs.
        3.4.10.8. The removal of snow from the air intake ducts and the access ladder pits will be the
        responsibility of the missile security forces.
        3.4.10.9. Extreme care will be taken to prevent piling of snow on any part of the soft support
        building, drainage ditches, or security antenna field.
        3.4.10.10. Security forces personnel will determine snow depth on request to support the daily
        Missile Maintenance Schedule.
     3.4.11. SCC Responsibilities:
        3.4.11.1. During the snow season, coordinate daily with 341 MOS/MXOOJ to determine which
        LFs need to be checked for snow removal and what priority of snow removal is required.
        3.4.11.2. During the snow season, coordinate daily with missile security to determine which LFs
        they may have declared RC2. RC2 sites have lowest priority unless included in the missile main-
        tenance schedule.
        3.4.11.3. Keep track of all reported snow conditions at the LFs.
     3.4.12. Snow Removal Operations on Missile Sites:
        3.4.12.1. The SCC, upon notification from maintenance plans and scheduling or MMOC, will dis-
        patch a snow removal team to the site to remove snow when required. If the snow must be
        removed from behind the launcher closure door, CE personnel will remove the bulk of the snow
        with the front-end loader, using extreme caution to prevent damage to gear rack and tracks. The
        area will be cleared six inches wider than the launcher closure and at least to the end of the gear
        rack and tracks. The balance of snow in the vicinity of the closure door will be removed, as
        required, by missile maintenance personnel responsible for operation of the closure door. On secu-
341SWI32-1001 10 MARCH 2004                                                                            19


     rity improved launch control system sites, CE personnel will remove snow west (east side of
     564th) of the launcher pylons using a plow or front-end loader, removing enough snow to allow an
     PT Van to back into the area so it can be pulled forward over the launcher closure. When removing
     snow on top of launcher closer door, use caution to clear lifeline attach point located in the middle
     of launcher closure door. The following is the area snow must be removed from.
     3.4.12.2. Area A. Entire topside and behind launch closure door (see Attachment 2, Wing 1 LF
     Area A and Attachment 5, 564 MS LF Area A).
     3.4.12.3. Area B. Entire topside (see Attachment 3, Wing 1 LF Area B and Attachment 6, 564
     MS LF Area B).
     3.4.12.4. Area C. Access to support building and turnaround area (see Attachment 4, Wing 1 LF
     Area C and Attachment 7, 564 MS LF Area C).
     3.4.12.5. Area D. MAFs.
     3.4.12.6. The snow controller will call the necessary personnel required to perform snow removal
     duties for maintenance and will schedule personnel and equipment in the sequence in which sites
     will be opened.
     3.4.12.7. The NCO or snow controller on duty in the SCC will coordinate with MMOC the prior-
     ities of sites requiring cleaning.
  3.4.13. 341st Logistics Readiness Squadron:
     3.4.13.1. Vehicle requirements beyond the available assets of CE will be requested from the logis-
     tics readiness squadron. Radio equipped, 6-passenger, 4x4 vehicles are the primary vehicle type
     required; however, suitable substitute vehicles may be provided should the primary vehicle not be
     readily available.
     3.4.13.2. The 341st Logistics Readiness Squadron may utilize vehicles from other lower priority
     units to meet this requirement.
     3.4.13.3. Horizontal construction section may have a requirement for seven vehicles of this type.
     3.4.13.4. These vehicles will be furnished on an "as needed" / "when needed" basis and will be
     returned to the 341st Logistics Readiness Squadron when no longer required.
  3.4.14. If needed, snow fence will be installed by horizontal construction at predetermined locations
  as designated by the missile engineering flight.
  3.4.15. 341st Missile Maintenance Teams:
     3.4.15.1. Will ensure vehicles are fully chained to ensure access to sites before they request snow
     removal. Snow depth of six inches or less will not be removed by CE.
     3.4.15.2. Remove snow by hand or with small blowers around security gate, cattle gates, launcher
     closure door, personnel access hatch, etc., after equipment plowing by CE or when snow depth is
     less than six inches.

                                                Chapter 4

                               SNOW REMOVAL ON PUBLIC ROADS

4.1. CES Responsibility: CES and FM personal will not plow or spread sand/chemicals on state, county,
or city owned roads/streets. CES and FM responsibility is limited to the access roads between county/state
road and the MAF or LF.

4.2. County Responsibility: The state/counties will plow state/county owned roads in accordance with
their established priorities. Under certain circumstances, CES may request extraordinary snow removal
(ESR). All requests for ESR on public roads will be called to the Cascade County dispatcher by CES snow
control or missile engineering, Cascade County will contact the appropriate county road department. The
appropriate county will only perform all snow removal.
     4.2.1. CES will furnish the Cascade County dispatcher with a list of personnel authorized to request
     work.
     4.2.2. State and county plows on public highways will pass MAF/LF entrances, possibly leaving
     berms that block the entrance. If access is subsequently required, CE plows will clear the berm at LFs
     if accumulation is more then can reasonably be shoveled, FMs will plow at the MAFs.

4.3. Extraordinary Snow Removal Agreement: The following paragraphs are portions extracted from
the extraordinary road program and snow removal agreement, which is rewritten every seven (7) years
and service prices adjusted each year through amendments to account for inflation. This agreement was
entered into by Malmstrom AFB, the nine counties (Cascade, Chouteau, Fergus, Judith Basin, Lewis and
Clark, Pondera, Teton, Toole, and Wheatland) and the US Department of Transportation, Federal High-
way Administration (FHWA).
     4.3.1. The Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC) certified the importance to national
     defense to provide ESR and requested FHWA to take actions using funds, approximately $150K,
     transferred to FHWA by the Department of the Air Force. The MTMC transfers money from the Air
     Force to the FHWA, who in turn transfers the funds to FHWA MT in Helena, MT. The FHWA MT fur-
     nishes the nine counties an annual mobilization fee. At the end of the snow season, each county sub-
     mits a recap of expenses to the Cascade County Clerk, who submits to FHWA MT for payment. The
     counties will be reimbursed their hourly rates for their actual hours utilized on ESR. Cascade County
     receives additional funds for managing the ESR program.
     4.3.2. Snow removal on county roads is the responsibility of local county agencies. The counties may
     not normally plow roads where remote sites are located if other means of access is available to the
     local inhabitants. The ESR program is only for roads not on the state maintained highway system
     unless otherwise determined by emergencies, or severe storms
     4.3.3. ESR will not be requested for routine maintenance if it can be expected the roads in question
     will be open by local agencies not later than five calendar days after termination of the snowstorm.
     4.3.4. ESR may be requested to insure snow removal on 48-hour notice after termination of a snow-
     fall for crew changes at MAFs and priority maintenance.
341SWI32-1001 10 MARCH 2004                                                                                21


   4.3.5. If within 72 hours after termination of snowfall/drifting, there is no indication that roads will be
   opened before the five-day time frame, arrangements will be made to request ESR. The base must
   establish a priority list to allow county flexibility.
   4.3.6. Sanding services should follow the same guidelines. Sanding should only be requested for con-
   voy movements. The county should be advised of sanding requirements at least 48 hours in advance,
   if practical, and confirmed two to three hours prior to departure.

4.4. Common questions: The following are commonly asked questions about snow removal.
   4.4.1. Can the AF sand/plow county roads? The AF is not authorized to plow or sand any county
   owned roads. County maintains their own roads and have entered into an agreement with Malmstrom
   to provide extra services under certain circumstances; this agreement is called Extraordinary Snow
   Removal (ESR). USAF pays for this service per occurrence and should be used sparingly.
   4.4.2. Who can call for ESR? CES snow control or missile engineering personnel who are identified
   on a letter to Cascade County dispatcher’s office are authorized to call for ESR. ESR for all areas is
   called into Cascade County and they are responsible to contact the appropriate highway Department
   4.4.3. What do we do to get county roads out of RED? Counties will plow and sand roads according
   to their regular schedules and priorities. County will not change their procedures solely because the
   AF calls a road RED. Conditions listed in 4.4.4. and 4.4.5. must exist.
   4.4.4. How long does county have to respond to an ESR request? Under normal circumstances, which
   include routine maintenance, County has five calendar days after snowfall termination to open roads,
   if after the first 72 hours there is indication removal will not be complete within the five days, arrange-
   ments may be made for ESR. ESR may be requested to ensure snow removal within 48 hours after
   snowfall termination for crew changeover and priority maintenance. History has shown the counties
   normally respond with-in hours of the requests.
   4.4.5. Will county sand roads if asked? The county will sand roads only for convoy movements. The
   county should be advised 48 hours prior to the convoy and be confirmed two to three hours prior to
   departure. Any cancellations or delays, SCC will communicate to county as soon as possible.

                                    POST SEASON REQUIREMENTS

6.1. General. Preparation for the next snow removal season starts at the end of the present season. The
logs documenting the problems/successes must be reviewed and eliminated or incorporated into the revi-
sion of the S&IC Instruction.

6.2. Equipment. The condition of equipment and the base's capability to effectively perform its mission
depends upon the inspection and maintenance performed. It must be thoroughly inspected, repaired, prop-
erly stored, and readily available for use in advance of each winter's operation.
     6.2.1. Snow removal equipment. All snow removal equipment will be thoroughly inspected at the end
     of the snow season by CE personnel. Prior to the inspection, equipment must be cleaned to ensure that
     bare wires, cracked windows or lenses, worn brakes, cracked or damaged frames, chutes, differential
     and gear cases, final drives, etc., oil or hydraulic leaks, worn belts or pulleys, and worn or cut tires are
     discovered.
        6.2.1.1. Items to be repaired later as operator maintenance will be annotated on a General Purpose
        Form and filed with the heavy repair superintendent.
        6.2.1.2. Equipment will be processed through vehicle maintenance by 1 June.
     6.2.2. Summer Rebuild Program. A formal program will be established by the Vehicle Maintenance
     Officer, which will ensure seasonal equipment will be fully serviceable and ready for use by 15 Sep-
     tember of each year. Local maintenance operating instruction will be prepared containing specific
     details of the program.
     6.2.3. Snow removal equipment will be returned to CE after deferred work orders have been written.
     Vehicle maintenance will establish a schedule for repairs.
        6.2.3.1. A comprehensive operator maintenance program will be established by the heavy repair
        superintendent and all repairs must be accomplished. Vehicles not scheduled for repainting will
        receive appearance repairs and touch-up in accordance with T.0. 36-1-3.
        6.2.3.2. Status of equipment will be briefed at commander's update briefings during the months of
        August and September.
     6.2.4. Vehicles designed exclusively for S&IC should not be used during the off-season for the
     accomplishment of other work.

6.3. Airfield, Road Surfaces, and Facilities. Immediately after the winter operation, action must be
taken to:
     6.3.1. Inspect airfield and road surfaces.
     6.3.2. Remove and store temporary snow fencing in the spring to reduce loss from weathering, fire,
     and deterioration. Posts will be removed with pullers, cleaned, and straightened. Discard badly dam-
     aged fencing. The remaining fencing should be repaired, cleaned, and rolled before storing. Store
     fence rolls in a storage yard or near their winter location. Bind rolls together with wire and place them
     where they will not interfere with vision or maintenance operations or be damaged by grass fires.
     Review records of all snow fence locations and determine plan for the following winter.
