                                             Chapter 1

                                 PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES

1.1. Purpose. This instruction outlines and explains the capabilities Air Force bands employ to
accomplish a wide range of objectives around the world. It provides commanders and Public
Affairs (PA) professionals the guidance to use the unique ability of music to bridge language and
cultural differences to build relationships with a wide variety of audiences and communicate a
broader, deeper sense of meaning behind their ideas and messages. Implementing Air Force
Policy Directive (AFPD) 35-1, Public Affairs Management, this document describes Air Force
bands, explains how they are functionally organized, and outlines their capabilities and activities.
1.2. Application. The guidance in this publication is authoritative and should be followed
except when, in the judgment of the commander, exceptional circumstances dictate otherwise.
When complying with official policy, guidance, and/or procedures, the unit may request a
waiver. Each compliance item is identified by a parenthetical tier level. See Air Force Instruction
(AFI) 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, for more information on tier levels, waiver
authorities, and the waiver process. Individual conduct, official programs, and daily activities
within Air Force bands should always be accomplished lawfully and ethically. If conflicts arise
between the content of this publication and Department of Defense guidance, higher level
guidance takes precedence for the activities of joint forces unless the Secretary of Defense has
provided more current and specific guidance.
1.3. Mission of Air Force Bands. Air Force bands provide a wide spectrum of musical support
for events that enhance the morale, motivation, and esprit de corps of our Airmen, foster public
trust and support, aid recruiting initiatives, and promote our national interests at home and
abroad.
1.4. Air Force Band Core Competencies. Four band core competencies provide the vision for
senior leaders to use the effects of music to accomplish the Air Force mission at home, overseas,
and in an expeditionary environment. These are the fundamental competencies of Air Force
bands and directly relate to their primary missions. Their strong linkage to the overarching PA
competencies serves as a foundation for the synergistic integration of all PA capabilities. For
more information, refer to AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Responsibilities and Management.
     1.4.1. Official Representation. Air Force bands serve as official representatives of the United
     States and the United States Air Force in the presentation of formal musical honors in state
     events and military ceremonies.
     1.4.2. Airman Morale and Readiness. Airman morale and readiness is the foundation of all
     Air Force core competencies. Bands provide Air Force leaders an effective and efficient
     means of building, maintaining, and strengthening morale and readiness.
     1.4.3. Public Trust and Support. Public trust and support are fundamental to a highly trained
     and well-equipped air, space, and cyberspace force. Bands strengthen the bonds between the
     Air Force and the public through a wide range of events designed to engage communities,
     opinion leaders, and the media.
     1.4.4. Global Influence and Deterrence. Bands directly affect international perceptions of the
     United States and the Air Force through musical events designed to engage audiences of
AFI35-110 11 AUGUST 2014                                                                          7


   strategic value. Bands partner with Headquarters (HQ) or Major Command (MAJCOM)
   International Affairs (IA) directorates to develop and implement engagement strategies
   targeted toward building partnerships and opening lines of communication with international
   audiences. Such actions enhance support from allies, and build and strengthen relationships
   with potential international partners.
1.5. Air Force Band Core Functions. Air Force band core competencies are supported and
enabled by five core functions. These functions represent key capabilities bands possess to
effectively perform their primary missions and assist Air Force leaders in creating desired effects
intended for target audiences.
   1.5.1. Air Force bands create and convey a profound sense of dignity at state events and
   official military ceremonies and functions by rendering appropriate and required honor to our
   nation and our Airmen. Bands create this dignity through the professionalism and quality of
   their music, drill, and Air Force image.
   1.5.2. Air Force bands design and support musical events which serve as communication
   platforms and facilitate the effective delivery of key messages to target audiences. Band
   leadership teams expertly combine diverse communication methods to ensure priority
   messages are delivered in the most effective way.
   1.5.3. Air Force bands represent the professionalism and commitment of the United States
   Air Force with the exceptional quality of their musical performance, diverse array of musical
   styles, and Air Force image. Performances are designed to capture and hold the attention,
   interest, and admiration of target audiences.
   1.5.4. Air Force bands actively design a wide variety of musical events to bridge language
   and cultural differences to engage, inform, entertain, and uplift audiences. Bands perform the
   right music for the right event and utilize performing styles and techniques which establish a
   sense of commonality and community with key audiences, drawing the largest number of
   attendees into the event.
   1.5.5. Air Force bands ensure the military readiness and deployability of Airman musicians.
1.6. Air Force Band Objectives. The Air Force conducts comprehensive, active Public Affairs
programs at all levels of command to provide target audiences with information contributing to
awareness and understanding of the Air Force’s mission. As a key capability of Public Affairs,
music can be used to enhance the communication process and enable Air Force leaders to reach
and affect the human spirit, thereby conveying a broader, deeper sense of meaning behind their
ideas and messages. With this capability in mind, bands design operations to:
   1.6.1. Render honor on behalf of the United States and the Air Force to our flag, national
   leaders, allies, guests, and Airmen in official state and military events as required, to include
   State Funerals, Presidential Inaugurations, White House and Pentagon arrival ceremonies,
   Changes of Command, and military funerals.
   1.6.2. Build, maintain, and strengthen the morale, esprit de corps, and readiness of Airmen in
   the United States (CONUS), outside the United States (OCONUS), and forward deployed
   locations.
 8                                                                 AFI35-110 11 AUGUST 2014


     1.6.3. Synergize band capabilities and the effects of music with the capabilities and effects
     of the broader Public Affairs community to increase the effectiveness of USAF
     communication.
     1.6.4. Increase public awareness and understanding of the bravery, sacrifice, and dedication
     of Airmen; the importance of airpower; and the mission, policies, programs, and heritage of
     the Air Force.
     1.6.5. Create, maintain, and strengthen relationships with a variety of publics to enhance the
     reputation of the Air Force as a good neighbor and as a respected, professional organization
     charged with an integral role in maintaining U.S. national security.
     1.6.6. Create, maintain, and strengthen relationships with strategic international audiences,
     using music to bridge cultural, societal, and socio-economic differences.
     1.6.7. Support Air Force recruiting by inspiring patriotism and encouraging highly qualified
     people to serve and remain in the Air Force, to include highly skilled, professional musicians
     to serve in Air Force bands.
1.7. The Use of Music in the Communication Process. Band events play a key role in the Air
Force communication process. Each event is an opportunity to engage and interact with a
particular public on behalf of the USAF and is planned and structured to maximize the
effectiveness and impact of the message being delivered. Airman musicians powerfully deliver
the right message at the right time to the right audience, even if the message is delivered through
music alone. Bands facilitate the use of music in the communication process in the following
ways:
     1.7.1. Band Leadership. Integrate the work of Band Operations and Band Public Affairs
     teams in support of senior leader objectives, and serve as a liaison between the band and
     other PA teams throughout the band’s geographic area of responsibility (AOR).
     1.7.2. Band Operations. Maximize the use of effects-based targeting to ensure band events
     are aligned with USAF, MAJCOM, and Wing priorities.
        1.7.2.1. PA Partnerships. Establish and maintain an aggressive, interactive relationship
        with supported COCOMs, MAJCOM, and Wing PA staffs in the band’s geographic AOR
        with the goal of synergizing capabilities to reach communication goals more effectively.
     1.7.3. Band Public Affairs. Create and maintain Band Public Affairs teams designed to
     facilitate the band’s participation in the Air Force communication process. Band Public
     Affairs should be actively engaged in the following four areas, and should coordinate these
     efforts with MAJCOM and wing Public Affairs staffs in their AOR as appropriate:
        1.7.3.1. Graphic Media: Design and create a wide range of printed products which
        directly and indirectly support Air Force communication goals and objectives.
        1.7.3.2. Social Media: Utilize a wide variety of Social Media to enhance engagement and
        communication goals. Explore new ways to use digital media in such a way as to add
        capability while saving time and money.
        1.7.3.3. Multimedia: Help integrate the effects of music into the mission of the broader
        Public Affairs community and assist in creating a variety of multimedia products
        designed to tell the Air Force story.
AFI35-110 11 AUGUST 2014                                                                   9


     1.7.3.4. Print and Broadcast Media: Engage and seek coverage from print and broadcast
     media to expand the reach and effectiveness of band operations.
  1.7.4. Integration. Ensure all levels of band personnel understand the role of music in the
  communication process and the role of Airman musicians within PA.
  1.7.5. Band Recordings. As appropriate, produce recordings that serve as force multipliers
  and produce desired effects designed to achieve specific goals and objectives in the
  communication process.

4.3. Administrative Capabilities. Active duty band units are organized into five administrative
functional areas or capabilities. Each of these broad areas encompasses various collateral duties
required to sustain and operate the unit. Individual units are authorized to organize each
functional area and align collateral duties as best facilitates their local mission. The following are
administrative capabilities required of all active duty band units:
   4.3.1. Band Operations.
   4.3.2. Band Readiness.
   4.3.3. Band Resources.
   4.3.4. Band Administrative Support.
   4.3.5. Band Public Affairs.
4.4. Band Readiness and Deployments. All Air Force Bands must be ready to perform their
mission in contingency and wartime environments. (T-1). Deploying Air Force band musical
support teams provide the combatant commander with operational assets specialized to enhance
Airman morale and readiness and support host nation outreach initiatives.

                                            Chapter 5

                                AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

5.1. Areas of Responsibility (AOR). CONUS Air Force bands operate in geographic AORs as
assigned by SAF/PA and the ANG. OCONUS Air Force bands operate in geographic AORs as
assigned by PACAF and USAFE. Figure 5.1. shows the AORs for active duty bands and Figure
5.2. shows the AORs for ANG bands. Coverage of any OCONUS Combatant Command AOR
not assigned to a band should be provided for in accordance with paragraph 6.5. and sub-
paragraphs, or via a Request For Forces (RFF). Coverage of any U.S. territory not assigned to a
band should be provided in accordance with paragraphs 5.1.1. through 5.1.2.7.
   5.1.1. Bands may support official or unofficial military events outside their AOR which are
   directly sponsored by their MAJCOM. The event should be sufficiently important to the
   MAJCOM to warrant support from a non-local band asset and bands should ensure the
   support is provided with fiscal prudence. Limited support to public events in conjunction is
   permissible to ensure that the itinerary includes a full schedule of performances, and to
   increase overall cost-effectiveness. For example, if the itinerary has military events on
   Monday and Wednesday, then the band may support a public event on Tuesday; however, the
   band should not extend their stay to perform a public event on Thursday. The requirements
   outlined in paragraphs 5.1.2. and sub-paragraphs do not apply for these out of AOR events.
   Bands should coordinate with the primary band assigned to that AOR and inform SAF/PAY.
   5.1.2. To support military or civilian sponsored public events outside their AOR, bands must
   follow guidance set forth in DoDI 5410.19, Public Affairs Community Relations Policy
   Implementation. (T-0). At least 30 days prior to the event, provide written confirmation of
   the following to SAF/PAY, or the Chief, ANG Bands as appropriate, along with the official
   request (AFORS number or DD Form 2536), the itinerary and a non-availability statement
   from the primary band assigned to cover the AOR:
       5.1.2.1. Support is in the best interest of the Air Force.
       5.1.2.2. No similar military asset local to the event is available to meet the request.
       5.1.2.3. No other military band assets are participating in the event. If other military
       bands are participating in the event, all participation must be in accordance with the
       Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs (ASD(PA)) Memorandum, Interim
       Guidance for Military Participation in Parades and Civic Celebrations, 7 March 2012,
       located at Attachment 3, or in accordance with an approved exception to policy from the
       ASD(PA).
       5.1.2.4. All opportunities for local area public concerts within the AOR have been met
       before accepting requests outside the AOR.
       5.1.2.5. No invitations from within the AOR are being declined to allow the unit to
       accept the invitation outside the AOR.
       5.1.2.6. The itinerary includes a full schedule of performances.
       5.1.2.7. Support is at no additional cost to the government.
AFI35-110 11 AUGUST 2014                                                                  25


       5.1.2.8. When The USAF Band or The USAF Academy Band performs in another
       band’s AOR, they should begin coordination with that band at least 6 months in advance
       in order to deconflict targeted locations with local operations. The USAF Band and The
       USAF Academy Band should provide courtesy copies of proposed itineraries to the band
       and to SAF/PAY at least 30 days in advance.
       5.1.2.9. Bands may combine assets to perform missions that cross AORs.
5.2. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs (OSAD(PA))
identifies the specific CONUS area five-year schedule for use by the National Capital Region
(NCR) based military bands to include The USAF Band.

                                           Chapter 6

                                        OPERATIONS

6.1. General Guidance.
   6.1.1. SAF/PAY manages all issues related to performance guidance for Air Force bands.
   Strategic oversight of active duty band operations rests with the assigned MAJCOM, DRU,
   or Wing Headquarters of each band. Strategic oversight of ANG band operations rests with
   the respective State Adjutants General (TAG).
   6.1.2. To ensure MAJCOM, DRU, or wing band objectives are codified, aligned, and
   prioritized, bands should maximize the use of effects-based targeting in the construction of
   their operational plans. In addition, planning should involve representatives from PA, Air
   Force Recruiting, Protocol, and other agencies as able and appropriate. Effects-based
   targeting should be ongoing in order to continually identify and assess priority missions.
   6.1.3. In order to build trust and maintain strong relationships with each PA and protocol
   office within their AOR, bands should proactively reach out to military sponsors, PA offices,
   and protocol offices regarding developing and recurring requirements.
   6.1.4. In order to deconflict schedules and promote partnership between active duty and
   ANG bands, scheduling representatives should provide each other with regular, ongoing
   feedback regarding operational and strategic planning.
6.2. Department of Defense Authority. The Department of Defense establishes policies for
military bands to perform at certain events, ceremonies, broadcasts, and other activities in the
civilian community. See DoDD 5410.18 and DoDI 5410.19 for more information. Bands must
obtain approval from SAF/PAY and/or OASD(PA) to participate in:
   6.2.1. Any event in the public domain that results in additional cost to the Air Force. These
   are costs, such as travel, transportation, meals, and lodging, which are incurred solely
   because of participation in or support of an activity or event which cannot be covered by the
   participating band’s budget. (T-0).
   6.2.2. Any event where more than one military band is requested to perform, unless
   participation is in accordance with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs
   Memorandum located at Attachment 3. (T-0).
   6.2.3. Public events in the NCR (regional and ANG bands only). The USAF Band
   coordinates with the Military District of Washington. (T-0).
   6.2.4. Events of international or national importance, including national conventions and
   meetings. (T-0).
   6.2.5. National sports and professional athletic events within the United States. (T-0).
   6.2.6. National television or radio events and programs. (T-0).
   6.2.7. Any request made for OCONUS travel, except Hawaii and Alaska, by military
   musical units located in the United States and its territories. (T-0).
 28                                                                AFI35-110 11 AUGUST 2014


6.3. Legal Guidelines.
   6.3.1. Rules for participation in public events.
      6.3.1.1. To ensure that every event complies with public law and DoD policy, at least
      one condition in each of the authorized participation criteria categories listed in DoDI
      5410.19, Enclosure 13 must be met. (T-0).
      6.3.1.2. Air Force bands may play music for public events and parades which are
      sponsored by corporate, private, or civic entities, when the sponsor’s role is clearly civic
      in nature and not political or commercial, the event is of general interest or benefit to a
      local, state, or national community, and is free and open to the entire community. Band
      support at events which are commercially sponsored, designed to increase business
      traffic, or associated with a particular religious or ideological movement (e.g. Christmas
      parade or political gathering), or would trivialize Air Force participation (e.g. beauty
      pageant) is not authorized.
      6.3.1.3. Air Force bands may perform incidental, short patriotic programs at events
      which are not supported with U.S. federal government funds and are not free to the public
      or not held on a military base (e.g. civilian sponsored social, civic, cultural, and athletic
      events). A patriotic program is defined as a program that helps a civilian sponsor provide
      honors to the flag and nation. It consists of patriotic or military music, appropriate
      military honors, and music for presenting the colors. Background, dinner, dance, or other
      social music is not authorized for these types of events.
      6.3.1.4. Air Force bands must not engage in the performance of music in competition
      with local civilian musicians. Refer to 10 USC §974, the Assistant Secretary of Defense
      for Public Affairs Memorandum, 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), 10
      U.S.C. §974, 5 November 2009, and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs
      Memorandum, Determination of Military Band Participation in Certain Military Relief
      Activities, 29 January 2010, located at Attachment 4, for the definitions of performances
      in competition with local civilian musicians.
      6.3.1.5. Bands may perform at events where general admission is charged only if the
      band’s participation is incidental to the primary event (e.g. county or state fairs, festivals,
      exhibitions). No additional charge may be imposed to hear the band play. Refer to DoDD
      5410.18, paragraph 4.1.4. and sub-paragraphs, and E2.1.14. for the descriptions of
      incidental support. Until such time as new guidance is issued by the ASD(PA), the
      definition of music allowable under incidental support is limited to DoDD 5410.18,
      paragraph E2.1.12.
      6.3.1.6. Guidance for support of charitable fund-raising activities hosted or sponsored by
      non-Federal entities is governed by DoD 5500.07-R. In general, the Air Force does not
      provide support to fundraising events, except as authorized by DoD 5500.07-R and by the
      Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Memorandum, Determination of
      Military Band Participation in Certain Military Relief Activities, 29 January 2010,
      located at Attachment 4. Providing support at charitable fund-raising events by military
      service members in uniform, performing in a military band, choral group, or portion
      thereof, is particularly inappropriate because they convey in that context a strong visual
AFI35-110 11 AUGUST 2014                                                                     29


     appearance of an endorsement of the non-Federal entity, its event, or its goals. For more
     information, contact your local legal office or SAF/PAY.
     6.3.1.7. Air Force bands are expected to perform concert tours and other concerts in
     traditional settings as part of their community outreach efforts.
     6.3.1.8. As Appropriated Fund activities, Air Force bands are not authorized to accept
     commercial sponsorship as outlined in AFI 34-108, Commercial Sponsorship and Sale of
     Advertising. Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 1353 and 41 C.F.R. 304-2.1, bands will not accept
     reimbursement or in-kind support from corporate, private, or civic entities to defray
     venue, lodging, meals, transportation, or other costs which would otherwise have been
     borne by the DoD. Air Force bands will not accept the free use of musical instruments,
     equipment, transportation, or other services. Co-sponsorship of civic events in
     accordance with DoDI 5410.20, Public Affairs Relations with Business and
     Nongovernmental Organizations Representing Business, and the Joint Ethics Regulation
     is authorized. Coordinate any questions with your local legal office or SAF/PAY.
  6.3.2. Rules for participation in Department of Defense events.
     6.3.2.1. Bands are authorized to support, subject to existing government-wide and DoD
     ethics rules and regulations, all musical requirements at official United States
     Government events, on or off military installations, which are supported, in whole or in
     part, by United States Government funds.
     6.3.2.2. Bands are authorized to support, subject to existing Government-wide and DoD
     ethics rules and regulations, all musical requirements at traditional, yet unofficial,
     military sponsored events (e.g. dinings-in and -out, awards banquets, holiday parties,
     military balls, etc.) on or off military installations, held only for service-members,
     service-members and their immediate families, or service-members, their immediate
     families and guests. Support for unofficial events held solely or primarily for family
     members is not authorized.
     6.3.2.3. Support to Non-appropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFIs). Air Force bands
     are authorized to perform in NAFI facilities for events as described in paragraphs 6.3.2.1.
     and 6.3.2.2. Otherwise, Air Force bands are not authorized to perform for events
     sponsored by membership association or revenue-generating NAFIs.
     6.3.2.4. Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) and Junior ROTC events.
     Bands may support Air Force ROTC and Junior ROTC ceremonial events and military
     balls as described in paragraphs. 6.3.2.1. and 6.3.2.2., provided these events are for
     ROTC cadets, faculty members, and guests. Band Operation and Maintenance (O&M)
     funds may be used to pay for band transportation and per diem expenses.
     6.3.2.5. Civil Air Patrol annual ceremonial events may be supported as outlined in
     paragraph 6.3.2.1., provided they have an active duty sponsor.
     6.3.2.6. Funding and transportation costs are the obligation of DoD sponsors for events
     outside the band’s AOR. Funding and transportation costs are the obligation of DoD
     sponsors for events within the AOR if the request comes after all resources have been
     allocated.
 30                                                               AFI35-110 11 AUGUST 2014


6.4. Requesting Band Performances.
   6.4.1. Except as noted below, all requests are submitted through the Air Force Outreach
   Request System (AFORS) at http://www.outreachrequests.hq.af.mil. Civilian sponsors
   should submit their request at least 90 days before the event. Military and government
   sponsors should submit their request at least 60 days in advance for active duty bands and 90
   days in advance for ANG bands. Military and federal government personnel, in their official
   capacity, should not act on behalf of civilian sponsors to submit requests for events, as doing
   so could constitute a violation of the Joint Ethics Regulation.
      6.4.1.1. Sponsors requesting the USAFE Band, the USAF Band of the Pacific-Asia or
      Air National Guard Bands submit a DD Form 2536 (for public events), or other locally
      identified form (for military or government events), to the Director of Operations for each
      band.
      6.4.1.2. The Military District of Washington (MDW) coordinates all requests for military
      band appearances at public events and non-Air Force official military and federal
      government functions within the NCR. For further assistance regarding requests within
      the NCR, please contact the MDW at (202) 685-4990 or (202) 685-1072.
      6.4.1.3. Air Force requesters within the NCR do not need to coordinate through the
      MDW office and should contact The USAF Band scheduler at 202-767-9253.
   6.4.2. In accordance with AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program, when a band cannot
   provide a solo bugler for a funeral ceremony, the Mortuary Affairs officer is authorized to
   obtain a bugler from other authorized providers and pay using Mortuary Affairs O&M funds.
   Additional options are also outlined in AFI 34-242.
6.5. OCONUS Band Support.
   6.5.1. The Secretary of Defense may delegate to commanders of combatant commands the
   authority to approve participation in public events overseas. Overseas MAJCOMs should
   follow guidance as prescribed in DoDD 5410.18 and DoDI 5410.19 as much as possible;
   however, the policy direction and guidance of their combatant command headquarters takes
   precedence. Overseas bands should advise SAF/PAY when they participate in any public
   event, recording, or video project that significantly affects their operations or requires major
   administrative, financial, or logistical support. In general, all performances must comply with
   the criteria for participation in public events outlined in paragraph 6.3. and subparagraphs.
   (T-0). Restrictions regarding performances in competition with civilian musicians do not
   apply to performances outside the United States, its commonwealths, or its possessions.
   6.5.2. Military services and subordinate commands located in the United States and its
   territories will refer all requests for OCONUS performances by CONUS-based units to the
   appropriate combatant command or SAF/PAY. (T-0).
   6.5.3. Requests for OCONUS performances by CONUS-based units may be approved only
   if:
      6.5.3.1. The combatant command evaluates the request and tasks in-theater assets if the
      request meets support criteria. If no in-theater assets are available and the event is
      sufficiently important to warrant support, the combatant command forwards the request,
AFI35-110 11 AUGUST 2014                                                                  31


      with its recommendation and embassy endorsement, to OASD/PA for evaluation and
      approval.
      6.5.3.2. OASD/PA evaluates the request and, if approved, forwards it to the appropriate
      military service for action.
   6.5.4. Approval procedure for Air National Guard band OCONUS support differs from the
   above only in that combatant commands submit their requests for ANG band support through
   National Guard Bureau-Public Affairs (NGB-PA). NGB-PA evaluates requests and submits
   its recommendation to OASD/PA for approval.
   6.5.5. Any situation not covered by the guidance on OCONUS travel of musical units
   stationed in the United States should immediately be brought to the attention of OASD/PA.
6.6. Band Reports.
   6.6.1. Active duty bands, except as noted below, will ensure their events in AFORS are
   closed-out by the 10th day of each month. (T-2).
      6.6.1.1. The USAF Band of the Pacific, the United States Air Forces in Europe Band,
      and the AFCENT Band will submit reports of monthly band performances, electronically
      to SAF/PAY, by the 10th day of each month. (T-2). In addition, the USAF Band of the
      Pacific and the United States Air Forces in Europe Band will email reports of projected
      performances to SAF/PAY by the 25th day of each month. (T-2).
      6.6.1.2. The USAF Band will email reports of monthly band performances to SAF/PAY
      by the 10th day of each month. (T-2).
   6.6.2. Every 6 months, ANG bands will submit reports of monthly band performances to the
   Chief, ANG Bands. (T-2). In addition, ANG bands will submit reports of noteworthy
   projected performance activities to the Chief, ANG Bands on an as-needed basis. (T-2).
   Examples of reported events should include any nationally televised events and events
   supporting Armed Forces Day/Week, Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Veterans Day.

                                           Chapter 8

                                         RECORDING

8.1. General Guidance. Air Force bands are highly encouraged to record. Recording plays an
important and multifaceted role in band operations and in promoting the proficiency and
readiness of Airman musicians. Quality recorded products serve as a clear demonstration of Air
Force excellence and professionalism and are used to help support Airmen, render honor to our
country and its heroes, engage public audiences at home and overseas, and support Air Force
recruiting efforts. Recording augments band operations in four critical ways:
   8.1.1. Recordings are powerful communication tools. Air Force bands produce, utilize, and
   distribute audio and video recordings as communication tools to strategically affect target
   audiences around the globe. Recordings are used to accomplish the following:
       8.1.1.1. Efficiently communicate key AF messages. Through the creative synergy of
       words, images, and/or sounds, recordings communicate key AF messages in highly
       memorable formats.
       8.1.1.2. Foster morale and enhance public trust. Band recordings harness the effects of
       music to foster and enhance the morale and esprit de corps of Air Force personnel, and
       strengthen public trust and support from the nation they serve.
       8.1.1.3. Communicate excellence. Quality recordings clearly communicate Air Force
       excellence to radio, television, and Internet audiences. This excellence inspires and
       educates audiences of all ages and attracts potential recruits, key concert partners,
       sponsors, and event coordinators.
       8.1.1.4. Bridge cultural barriers. Recordings use music to bridge language, cultural,
       societal, and socio-economic barriers, and can be an effective part of relationship-
       building operations.
   8.1.2. Recordings serve as force-multipliers. Air Force band recordings serve as force
   multipliers in the following ways:
       8.1.2.1. Expand a band’s reach. Recordings can be employed to significantly expand a
       band’s reach. Due to their small size and the abundant methods of playback, recordings
       are a cost-effective way to multiply a band’s ability to reach target audiences and thereby
       increase its effectiveness.
       8.1.2.2. Re-usable outreach tools. While recordings don’t provide as dynamic an
       experience as live concerts, recordings are a permanent representation of the Air Force’s
       corporate image. Due to their ease of use (and re-use), recordings have the potential to
       not only reach a wider variety of audiences, but reach them numerous times.
       8.1.2.3. Helpful recruiting tools. As industry-standard demonstrations of musical
       excellence in a commercially accepted format, band recordings not only provide musical
       support to the Air Force’s broader recruiting efforts, but help attract and encourage highly
       skilled musicians to consider a career in the Air Force.
   8.1.3. The recording process provides highly effective musical training for Air Force
   musicians. The nature of the recording process makes it an unparalleled and uniquely
 34                                                              AFI35-110 11 AUGUST 2014


   effective way for musicians to maintain and improve their skills while remaining engaged in
   ongoing operations. Whether performing, leading, or producing, the recording process
   challenges, tests, and improves a wide variety of skills necessary to maintain musical
   proficiency and readiness. Recording enhances musical training in the following ways:
      8.1.3.1. Functions like a critical military exercise focused on operational readiness. The
      recording process vigorously tests the skills bands use every day in standard musical
      operations, and provides intense, direct feedback which highlights areas of excellence
      and areas requiring improvement. Skill levels are then documented in an industry
      standard recording format (CD, MP3, DVD).
      8.1.3.2. Shortens the music performance feedback cycle. The recording process focuses
      intensely on the synergy of technical skill and creative artistry of professional Airman
      musicians. With immediately repeated cycles of practice, performance, and assessment,
      recording enables bands to maintain and push the boundary of their peak performance
      levels. While other band operations generally contain this same cycle, the immediacy of
      the repetition, the absence of a live audience (other than peers), and the goal of producing
      a permanent product for distribution make the recording process an effective training
      environment.
      8.1.3.3. Provides on the job training. One-deep manning and a persistent, yet irregular,
      OPSTEMPO often present a serious challenge to band training programs. The recording
      process helps solve that challenge by helpfully combining mission and training. The
      rigorous discipline involved in the recording process focuses on musical skill and
      proficiency more intensely than any other band activity.
      8.1.3.4. Provides irreplaceable benefits to individual musicians. Once the Air Force
      accesses a musician, very little additional musical training is mandated by the Career
      Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP.) Commissioned and enlisted musicians
      maintain technical proficiency through participation in ongoing operations. Music,
      however, involves more than just technical skill. Airman musicians are professional
      artists who, like other professionals, should constantly push themselves beyond their
      limits to maintain peak skill. The recording process creates the environment required to
      maintain the highest standards of excellence.
      8.1.3.5. Provides irreplaceable benefits to performing groups. These principles apply to
      Air Force performing groups as well. To become an artistic team, entire groups should be
      pushed beyond their collective limits to develop and maintain peak proficiency.
      8.1.3.6. Provides irreplaceable benefits to bandleaders. The recording process critically
      challenges, tests, and improves core listening, rehearsing, performing, and leadership
      skills of both commissioned and enlisted bandleaders.
8.2. Coordination.
   8.2.1. Active duty bands will coordinate in writing with the Air Force Chief of Music,
   SAF/PAY, regarding formal audio or video recording projects. (T-2). Air National Guard
   bands will coordinate in writing with the Chief, ANG Bands, NGB/CF, regarding audio or
   video recording projects. (T-2).
AFI35-110 11 AUGUST 2014                                                                       35


   8.2.2. Written proposals must include a short description of the strategy and content, and
   outline any intent to package or distribute the recording. (T-2). If the recording project
   includes packaging and distribution, the proposal will include an overview of the graphic
   design (with particular attention paid to the required elements listed in par. 8.4. below) and
   the distribution plan. (T-2).
   8.2.3. Policy guidance for video recordings is located in AFI 35-109, Visual Information.
   Depending on the type of video recording being created, requirements may vary significantly
   from audio recordings. Early coordination with the installation and/or MAJCOM PA offices
   or the Chief, ANG Bands, as appropriate, is highly encouraged to ensure all requirements are
   met.
8.3. Planning. A careful, effects-based approach to reaching target audiences significantly
increases the degree to which recordings augment a band’s mission. Planning should involve the
following:
   8.3.1. Communication Planning Process. In the earliest stages of the recording process,
   active duty bands should coordinate with senior leadership and their local Public Affairs
   team to identify the target audience and desired effects for each recording project. ANG
   bands may develop this plan internally and / or with their local or state Public Affairs team.
   Once the audience and effects have been identified, the band should utilize the
   Communication Planning Process (Research, Plan, Execute, and Assess) to develop the
   programming, design and distribution elements of the project. Refer to AFI 35-101, Chapter
   4 for more information.
   8.3.2. Effects-based musical programming. Bands should select, arrange, organize, and
   perform music in such a way as to create a series of specific effects in support of COCOM,
   HAF, MAJCOM and local commander priorities.
   8.3.3. Effects-based graphic design. The artistic pairing of music and graphic design is a
   critical element of the recording project. Bands should ensure music and graphic art are
   complementary in style and quality, and are designed to achieve desired effects in the target
   audience. Regardless of its artistic style, each project should reflect the professionalism and
   corporate image of the Air Force. See paragraph 8.4 and subparagraphs for more information.
   8.3.4. Effects-based product distribution. Bands should design distribution strategies based
   on demographic studies of their target audience. As playback technologies and the listening
   habits of consumers become more diverse, so should the distribution methods. Bands should
   be prepared to utilize innovative, cost-effective and practical methods of distribution that
   effectively reach target audiences.
8.4. Graphic Design.
   8.4.1. Air Force corporate image.
       8.4.1.1. The Air Force logo will be prominently displayed on the exterior and interior of
       any graphic art associated with the recording. (T-2). See the following for authorized
       logos: http://www.trademark.af.mil/downloads/mediagallery.asp?galleryID=6588.
       8.4.1.2. The ANG logo will also be prominently displayed on the exterior of any graphic
       art associated with an ANG band recording. (T-2). See the following for authorized
       logos: http://www.ang.af.mil/shared/media/ggallery/webgraphic/AFG-120410-003.jpg.

       8.4.1.3. The graphic design should creatively represent some aspect of following
       attributes associated with the Air Force corporate image: technologically advanced
       guardians of new security domains; capable of winning against complex threats; highly
       professional and empowered thinkers; skilled innovators; compassionately human.
   8.4.2. Disclaimers. Any significant packaging or graphic art accompanying the recording
   must include the following statements / disclaimers (exceptions and variations must be
   approved by the Air Force Chief of Music):
       8.4.2.1. Air Force Motto: “Aim High…Fly, Fight, Win” (T-2).
       8.4.2.2. “This recording is approved for Department of the Air Force use and is not for
       sale.” (T-2).
       8.4.2.3. “The United States Air Force is wholeheartedly committed to reflecting the
       diversity of our great nation. Individuals from all cultural and ethnic backgrounds are
       actively encouraged to learn about and seek positions in the Air Force. For more
       information, contact Air Force Recruiting via http://www.airforce.com/ or call 1-800-

       8.4.2.5. Recruiting Statement for ANG band recordings: “Guarding America, Defending
       Freedom” “Contact Air National Guard Recruiting via http://www.goANG.com or call
       1-800-TO-GO-ANG.”(T-2).
8.5. Copyright.
   8.5.1. Use of material protected by copyright in products released by the Air Force must
   honor the rights of the copyright owner (T-0) and comply with the law. (T-0). Refer to Air
   Force Instruction 51-303, Intellectual Property—Patents, Patent Related Matters,
   Trademarks And Copyrights, and Title 17 United States Code for more information.
   8.5.2. Bands are highly encouraged to consider developing and recording content
   unrestricted by copyright or licensing agreements to remove barriers for use and distribution.
   8.5.3. Active duty regional bands and ANG bands are required to contact the Air Force
   Public Affairs Agency (AFPAA) Copyright and Licensing Support Section and use their
   copyright research capabilities if available.
8.6. Distribution.
   8.6.1. Bands should make every effort to maximize legal public access to their recordings
   and consider using a variety of distribution methods for each project, to include CDs, DVDs,
   downloadable, or streaming files posted on a variety of sites, download cards, and file-
   sharing services. Research and planning for band media products should seek maximum
   flexibility and opportunity to re-purpose or re-format content for multiple uses.
   8.6.2. Distribution plans must also include the following:
       8.6.2.1. USAF Museum. Send three copies of recordings to the National Museum of the

      9.5.5.5. The United States Air Force Band: 92,000 square feet.
9.6. Vehicles. Bands are the primary users of vehicles assigned to their units. Minimum
requirements are determined by the AF Element Vehicle and Equipment Management Support
Office (AFELM VEMSO) during vehicle validation visits. Based on historical and ongoing
mission parameters, recognized requirements are as follows:
   9.6.1. The United States Air Force Band: five intercity coaches, three five-ton trucks with
   lifts, two 15-passenger van/truck carry-alls, and one 8-passenger van/truck carry-all.
   9.6.2. The United States Air Force Band of the Pacific-OL-A (Hawaii): one five-ton truck
   with lift, and two 15-passenger van/truck carry-alls.
   9.6.3. The United States Air Force Band of the Pacific (Asia): one intercity coach, one five-
   ton truck with lift, two 2.5-ton trucks with lift, and two 15-passenger van/truck carry-alls.
   9.6.4. Fifteen-member unit: two trucks (any combination of: 2.5-ton truck with lift, 5-ton
   truck with lift, 6-passenger truck with topper, as determined by local requirements) and two
   15-passenger van/truck carry-alls.
   9.6.5. Forty-five member unit: two intercity coaches, three trucks (any combination of 2.5-
   and five-ton trucks each with lift, as determined by local requirements), and two 15-
   passenger van/truck carry-alls.
   9.6.6. Sixty-member unit: two intercity coaches, three trucks (any combination of 2.5- and
   five-ton trucks each with lift, as determined by local requirements), and three 15-passenger
   van/truck carry-alls.
      Note:
      1. Truck lift requirements: folding platform rail lift rated at 3,000 lb max load weight,
      66”-72” deep platform, 90” with 12” fixed ramp with 4” cart stop (to lift/lower road cases
      up to 45” wide x 42” deep safely).
      2. The five-ton and 2.5-ton trucks should have lifts which can be used in conjunction with
      a loading dock.

   9.6.7. In accordance with Air Force Instruction 24-301, Vehicle Operations, intercity
   coaches are assigned to the vehicle operations branch of the Logistics Readiness Squadron
   with the band as the primary user. All band travel requirements must be met before the
   coaches are used to support other authorized activities. When no band requirements exist,
   coaches may be used for other on- or off-base transportation needs.
   9.6.8. When an intercity coach is not available for band use, it is the responsibility of the
   installation Vehicle Management activity to short-term lease or charter a replacement vehicle
   to meet the band’s scheduled engagements. Funding for leased or chartered buses is provided
   by the band. Since charter contracts usually require a minimum of 24-hours prior notice,
   band coaches must not be used for non-band travel 24 hours before a scheduled band trip.
AFI35-110 11 AUGUST 2014                                                                   41


  This ensures sufficient time to make repairs or obtain a commercial contract for a
  replacement coach if the band coach should develop mechanical problems.
  9.6.9. The band pays drivers’ TDY expenses for all band-related travel. Band members must
  be trained and licensed in accordance with AFI 24-301 and any local requirements in order to
  drive any owned, leased, or rented government motor vehicle. (T-1).
  9.6.10. Changes to vehicle authorizations or new requirements are submitted to the
  installation Vehicle Fleet Manager for review and subsequent submittal to AFELM VEMSO
  for approval. Refer to AFI 24-302, Vehicle Management, for more information concerning
  vehicle authorizations and short-term lease request process.

                       ACCESSIONS, TRAINING, AND UTILIZATION

10.1. Advertising and Audition Authority.
   10.1.1. Due to the uniqueness of recruiting Air Force band members with existing
   specialized skills, bands have the authority to audition and musically qualify applicants to
   serve in the Air Force.
   10.1.2. Per AFRS exception to policy, bands are authorized to use their O&M funding to
   purchase their own band audition advertising. See Attachment 2 for details.
10.2. Accessions.
   10.2.1. Officers.
      10.2.1.1. Pre-screening. Applicants for Air Force band officer positions (35B) undergo a
      two-step pre-screen process to audition for the Air Force band program. The first step
      includes an initial selection review of a resume, official college transcripts, repertoire list,
      letters of recommendation, and a 15- to 30-minute DVD demonstrating their conducting
      skills. Once selected, applicants then meet with their local Air Force recruiter to
      determine if they meet Air Force eligibility requirements (to include age, weight,
      medical, financial, and criminal record). Members who pass both steps of the pre-screen
      process are invited to perform a live musical audition.
      10.2.1.2. Auditions. The active duty officer audition panel will consist of the Air Force
      Chief of Music, two or more band officers, and at least one regional band Chief Master
      Sergeant. The ANG officer audition panel will consist of the ANG, Chief of Bands, one
      other band officer, and at least one ANG band manager. Audition requirements for active
      duty and ANG band officers may be found at http://www.bands.af.mil/careers/.
      10.2.1.3. Accession. Upon successful completion of the audition, qualified applicants for
      active duty bands receive a Band Officer Qualification/Certification letter from the Air
      Force Chief of Music and contact an Air Force recruiter to initiate formal entrance
      procedures into the United States Air Force. Qualified applicants for ANG bands receive
      a Band Officer Qualification/Certification letter from the ANG, Chief of Bands before
      contacting an ANG recruiter to initiate formal entrance procedures into the United States
      Air Force.
   10.2.2. Enlisted.
      10.2.2.1. Pre-screening. Applicants for Air Force regional band (AFSC: 3N1X1) and
      premier band (AFSC: 3N2X1) positions undergo a two-step pre-screen process to
      audition for the Air Force band program. The first step includes an initial selection
      review of a pre-recorded CD or DVD and performance resume. Once selected, applicants
      then meet with their local Air Force recruiter to determine if they meet Air Force
      eligibility requirements (to include age, weight, medical, financial, and criminal record).
      Members who pass both steps of the pre-screen process are invited to perform a live
      musical audition.
AFI35-110 11 AUGUST 2014                                                                        43


      10.2.2.2. Auditions. Premier, regional, or ANG (AFSC: 3N1X1Z) band commanders or
      band managers must listen to a live audition to musically qualify an applicant for
      accession. (T-2). Standardized audition requirements for active duty and ANG bands may
      be found at http://www.bands.af.mil/careers/. Comparable substitutions to the posted
      list (as determined and approved by band commanders or managers) are authorized.
      10.2.2.3. Accession into active duty bands. According to Air Force Instruction 36-2002,
      Regular Air Force and Special Category Accessions, upon successful completion of an
      audition, qualified applicants complete AF IMT 485, Application for Enlistment - US Air
      Force Band. Gaining band commanders or band managers sign the AF IMT 485 to
      certify qualification and forward a scanned copy to the Air Force Band Career Field
      Manager. Qualified applicants then contact their Air Force recruiter to initiate formal
      entrance procedures into the United States Air Force.
      10.2.2.4. Accession into ANG Bands. Upon successful completion of an audition,
      applicants receive a letter of qualification from the band commander or band manager
      written on official letterhead. Qualified applicants then contact an ANG recruiter to
      initiate formal entrance procedures into the ANG.
      10.2.2.5. Prior Service. Members who have served in a Reserve, ANG, or active duty
      component of the armed forces may audition and, if found musically qualified, enter
      active duty in the regional or premier band career fields. Applicants must meet all non-
      prior service requirements to include age, weight, medical, financial, and criminal record.
      To calculate accession age, subtract total previous active duty time from the applicant’s
      current age.
      10.2.2.6. Retraining. Airmen may apply to retrain into the band career field when a
      vacancy becomes available and their service requirements have been met. As with other
      applicants, Airmen must submit a pre-recorded CD and performance resume and be
      found musically qualified by performing a live audition. Once the member is found
      musically qualified and receives a signed AF IMT 485, he or she applies for retraining
      status through vMPF. Applications for retraining are approved through AFPC/DPTOT
      Retraining. Normal military service requirements apply: first-term Airmen (4-year
      enlistment contract) assigned to a stateside base are eligible to apply to retrain after they
      have completed 35 months (no more than 43 months) of military service. A 6-year
      enlistee may apply to retrain after completing 59 months of military service.
10.3. Training.
   10.3.1. Officers. Active duty and ANG band officers achieve the 35B1 specialty code
   through the band officer audition process and by graduating from Officer Training School.
      10.3.1.1. Active Duty.
          10.3.1.1.1. Active duty band commanders administer the band officer training
          program primarily through the Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) for
          the 35B career field.
          10.3.1.1.2. To earn the 35B3 specialty code, active duty band officers must also
          accomplish the requirements for the 35P career field specialty by attending the Public
          Affairs Qualifying Course at the Defense Information School. (T-2).
 44                                                              AFI35-110 11 AUGUST 2014


       10.3.1.2. ANG.
           10.3.1.2.1. The Chief, ANG Bands administers the band officer training program
           primarily through Memorandum P000-003 “ANG Band Officer Training.”
           10.3.1.2.2. ANG band officers are not required to take the Public Affairs Qualifying
           Course to earn the 35B3 specialty code.
   10.3.2. Enlisted.
       10.3.2.1. Active duty and ANG band commanders administer the training programs IAW
       AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, primarily through the CFETP for career field
       specialties 3N1X1, 3N2X1, and 3N1X1Z.
       10.3.2.2. This CFETP provides information that commanders, the Career Field Manager,
       Chief Enlisted Managers, training specialists, supervisors, and trainers need to plan,
       develop, manage, and conduct an effective career field training program. It outlines the
       training individuals should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their
       career life-cycle.
       10.3.2.3. All active duty and ANG band members achieve Apprentice (3-skill level)
       through the standardized audition process, and by serving in the 737th Training Group
       Drum and Bugle Corps at Basic Military Training (BMT).
           10.3.2.3.1. Air Force band members do not attend a technical training school after
           BMT. They proceed directly to their first duty station.
           10.3.2.3.2. Upon completion of BMT, ANG band members complete follow-on
           training by using one of two training options selected by the ANG band commander
           at the time of enlistment.
              10.3.2.3.2.1. Option 1: 120 days of training with an active duty USAF band.
              10.3.2.3.2.2. Option 2: Training at a regionally accredited college or university
              for one academic term.
10.4. Utilization.
   10.4.1. Internal Utilization. With the exception of Band Managers and Superintendents, all
   enlisted band members perform with at least one component of the band, as directed by the
   band commander. With the exception of Band Managers and Superintendents, all enlisted
   band members execute collateral responsibilities, as outlined in paragraph 4.3., in addition to
   their musical specialties.
   10.4.2. External Utilization. Band members must not be given other duties by external
   agencies that interfere with performances, rehearsals, preparations, other musical duties, or
   scheduled down time.
       10.4.2.1. Rehearsals are training missions, dynamic in nature, and essential to mission
       success. Musical missions are often scheduled at night, on weekends, and holidays, so
       providing and protecting adequate down time is vital. Neither training missions nor down
       time should be interfered with. Individual musicians should not be scheduled for other
       duties when they conflict with a unit rehearsal, performance, or scheduled down time.
AFI35-110 11 AUGUST 2014                                                                      45


      10.4.2.2. The wartime mission of bands remains the same as the peacetime mission, with
      the additional responsibility of deploying to theaters of operations. In wartime, bands
      must perform their primary mission. Band members must remain with their units during
      contingency operations or general war. Air Force Band members should not be tasked to
      perform duties in other functional areas; this applies to both regular and recurring
      responsibilities as well as augmentation for exercises. Air Force Band members train and
      perform in elements that require 100 percent manning of assigned positions. The loss of
      even one position may render a unit ineffective and lead to mission failure at either their
      home base or deployed area of responsibility. Note: Band members may be treated as
      part of the base manpower pool during local real-world disaster situations.
      10.4.2.3. The ANG band program’s unique federal and state mission includes
      deployment, disaster relief, and homeland defense missions. ANG band members shall
      receive Category B weapons qualification and training as detailed in AFI 36-2226. (T-1).
      All members are required to maintain a current military passport. Members shall receive
      all training as required by deployment reporting instructions or as deemed necessary by
      the ANG Chief of Bands. (T-1). This training will be provided by their local wings or
      supporting commands. Airmen shall receive equipment as specified by reporting
      instructions or as deemed necessary by the ANG Chief of Bands. (T-1)
10.5. Off-Duty Employment Responsibilities. Public law and the Joint Ethics Regulation
govern off-duty employment military members.
   10.5.1. As outlined in 10 USC, Section 974, members of military bands, performing in their
   official capacities, are restricted in the degree to which they may compete with civilian
   musicians. This section does not apply to off-duty performances by military band members.
   Off-duty employment must comply with DoDD 5500.07 (T-0), DoDD 5500.07-R (T-0), and
   any local or MAJCOM requirements (T-1). Consult the local staff judge advocate for
   requirements and additional guidance. Band members who perform off-duty will not use
   government owned equipment or resources. Band members shall not use nor allow the use of
   their titles, positions, or organization names in conjunction with off-duty employment.
