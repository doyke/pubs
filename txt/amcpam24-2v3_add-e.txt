This pamphlet series is intended as a load planning guide and provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners (both long range and individual
movement) to load plan aircraft in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). Equipment and methods
listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed. It must be noted that,
unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not standardized, and can vary widely,
even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval, therefore, ultimately rests with the
individual contractor providing airlift services to the DOD. This pamphlet series enables
application of DTR 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation – Part III Mobility, Appendix
V, Aircraft Load Planning and Documentation; as well as AMCI 10-402, Civil Reserve Air Fleet
(CRAF). The guidance contained herein is applicable to all USAF, AFRC, ANG and DOD
agencies whenever they are charged with using the CRAF assets contained herein, in accordance
with DOD, inter-service, and/or MAJCOM agreements.

                                            Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose. This pamphlet series is non-directive in nature. It provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners to more efficiently and effectively
load plan aircraft in the CRAF.

1.2. Scope. CRAF aircraft specifications listed herein are current as of the date of this printing.
Equipment and methods listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed.
It must be noted that, unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not
standardized, and can vary widely, even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval,
therefore, ultimately rests with the individual contractor providing airlift services to the
DOD.
1.2.1. Volume 3, Boeing. AMCPAM 24-2 Volume 3 deals specifically with aircraft
manufactured by the Boeing Company. Boeing was first formed in 1916 as Pacific               Aero
Products Co, changing its name about a year later to the Boeing Airplane Co. Through several
mergers over the years (the last being with McDonnell Douglas Corp in 1997), the Boeing
Company has melded the companies founded by aerospace pioneers William Boeing, Donald
Douglas, James McDonnell, James "Dutch" Kindelberger, and Howard Hughes Jr. As of the date
of this publication, the Boeing Company has produced almost 17,000 commercial jet aircraft
alone, with over 12,100 still in service.

1.3. Arrangement. This pamphlet series is designed for easy reference and access to the most
commonly needed information for planning purposes. Essentially, Volume 1 will contain all
information common to the entire CRAF program and most, if not all, carriers. Volumes 2
through 5 will contain information specific to a particular manufacturer’s airframes, with each
sub-volume addendum addressing a different series or type. Each can be referenced separately
from another; however, each addendum needs to be used in conjunction with Volume 1.
1.3.1. Volume 3, Boeing Addenda. Volume 3 is not separated from each subsequent addendum,
but is published as a “cover” document along with and as an introduction for each addendum.
The same information for Volume 3 essentially gets republished--unchanged with each Boeing
model’s addendum.
1.3.2. Volume 3, Boeing Quick Reference Tables. All chapter descriptions for various models
are designed to be used in conjunction with Chapter 2 Quick Reference Tables. The information
in the Quick Reference Tables will generally not be restated in the expanded chapters as they are
meant primarily for pictorial figures.

1.4. Supplements. Changes or supplements to this pamphlet by agencies, other than AMC, are
prohibited. This does not preclude its use as a reference document for preparation of intra-
agency instructional directives.

1.5. Acronyms. An explanation of the acronyms used in this pamphlet is in AMCPAM 24-2,
Volume 1, Attachment 1.

1.7. Description. Addendum E. Boeing B767 Series.
The B767 Series aircraft are wide-body, twin engine aircraft, designed for short to medium
range. The ER models can also fly long range routes, due to advanced systems and
modifications, and the first to be approved by the FAA for Extended Twin Engine Operations
(ETOPS) 120 and 180 minutes long. Incorporating newer technology, lighter materials, and a
thicker, longer wing, the B767 has increased performance and economy. The B767 and the B757
series aircraft were developed concurrently, and share many common features, allowing pilots
dual qualifications. Therefore, many companies operate with both B767's and B757's, increasing
efficiency and savings. To date, 981 B767's have been made, with orders for over 50 more.

The B767-200 was developed for roughly three years before its first flight on September 1981,
being type-certified in July 1982. Featuring many common features as the B757, it also shared
common engines with the B747, as well as having over four feet more width than a standard
narrow-body. Before production ceased in 1994, 128 B767-200's were manufactured

The next model, the B767-200ER, or extended range, was developed right after the first B767-
200 was delivered. Identical to the B767-200, except for center fuel tanks, it first flew and was
type-certified in March 1984. 121 B767-200ER's have been manufactured to date.

B767-200SF. Israel Aerospace Industries received a FAA Supplemental Type Certificate in July
2004 to convert B767-200 and -200ER's into freighters. The B767-200SF ("SF" for Special
Freighter), has all passenger windows, galleys, and exits removed, and the main compartment
floor strengthened and cargo door added. As of 2009, 38 B767-200SF's have been converted.

The B767-300 was developed after the B767-200ER, and had its maiden flight in January 1986,
being type-certified by September. Having all of the features as the B767-200, the B767-300 was
stretched 21' 1", and accommodates more passengers. 104 B767-300's have currently been made.

The B767-300ER incorporated center fuel tanks into the basic B767-300. It flew first in
December 1986, but wasn't type-certified until January, 1988. Currently the most popular model
in the series, 536 have been delivered so far, with dozens on order.
AMCPAM24-2V3_ADD-E             14 OCTOBER 2011                                           7


The B767-300F first flew in June, and was type-rated in October of 1995. The B767-300F ("F"
for Freighter), is a B767-300ER with a main compartment modified for cargo, to include a left-
side cargo door. 54 have made so far, with 28 orders, plus some -300/-300ER conversions.

The B767-400ER is the second "stretch job", being 21' longer than the B767-300ER. It first flew
in October 1999, and was type-certified on July 2000. Offered as an extended range version only,
the B767-400ER also incorporated a new wing design and new engines. There have been 38
B767-400ER's produced to date.

AMCPAM 24-2, Volume 3, Addendum E will focus primarily on the:

                               QUICK REFERENCE TABLES

2.1. Ranges. Most numbers are shown as a range, due to representing all-passenger to all-freight
versions OR due to different modifications within a series/type. Also, within a series, several
different engines/weight classes may exist.

2.2. Pallets. Unless otherwise noted, pallet information is based on the civilian pallet IATA code
PAG- / P1P- type LD7 which measures 88" × 125".

2.3. Table Legends.
2.3.1. Compartments. Unless otherwise noted, compartments are: M=Main/Upper;
F=Forward/Lower Lobe; A=Aft/Lower Lobe; B=Bulk/Lower Lobe.

2.3.2. “X”. An “X” represents the information does NOT apply for that series/type (ex: an all-
passenger version would have an “X” by Main Compartment Door)

2.3.3. Question Mark “?”. A “?” represents that the information should apply, but no
information exists in the manufacturer’s technical manuals.

2.3.4. Exclamation Point “!”. An “!” represents information that should apply, but has been
derived from a reliable, but non-manufacturer source.

                   B767 AEROMEDICAL EVACUATION CAPABILITY

A2.1. Activation. As of the date of this publication, the B767 airframe is the only type aircraft
that will be contracted and/or activated for fixed-wing aeromedical evacuation by the CRAF
program. Currently, plans for the use of the B767 are for aeromedical evacuation requirements
during a Stage II and/or Stage III CRAF Activation.

A2.2. Availability. When the AE Segment is activated, carriers shall have 48 hours to
reconfigure aircraft to the baseline status and deliver to the Aeromedical Evacuation Shipsets
(AESS) contractor for conversion. Subsequent delivery will be two aircraft for conversion every
24 hours thereafter, until the requirement is met or the carrier commitment is exhausted.

A2.3. CRAF AESS. The AESS is an aircraft mission conversion set that reconfigures B767
aircraft to an aeromedical configuration. A B767 with the AESS installed can carry litter and
ambulatory patients, medical crews, flight attendants, and aircraft maintenance personnel in
times of emergency.

A2.4. Configurations. The AESS will accommodate 10 medical crew personnel, 5 flight
attendants, and the 87 litter patients. The B67-200 series will have approximately 30 seats, and
the B767-300 series 47 seats. These may be used for crew, ambulatory patients, or passengers.
See Figure A1.1 and Figure A1.2 for baseline and AESS configurations for the B767-200 series
and the B767-300 series. Installation of the Liquid Oxygen (LOX) converter pallet assembly
will be installed in the forward cargo compartment. The LOX converter pallet consists of two
LOX container assemblies and the associated tubing and equipment.

A2.5. Reconfiguring AESS. Once an aircraft is configured, it will not be changed by anyone
other than an FAA-certified aircraft mechanic or engineer with access to the FAA-approved
Supplemental Type Certificate for that specific aircraft.
