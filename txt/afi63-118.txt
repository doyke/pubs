Section Bâ€”Air Force Civil Engineer Research, Development, and Acquisition Process

4. Overview. Identification of civil engineer research, development, and acquisition requirements fol-
lows two separate but similar paths--the Environmental Quality Process and the Air Base Systems Pro-
cess (see Figure 1. for more information). The Environmental Quality Process considers Pollution
Prevention, Compliance, Conservation, and Restoration requirements. The Air Base Systems process
considers all non-environmental civil engineer requirements (i.e., Air Base Operability, Chemical and
Biological Defense, Fire Protection, Operability and Repair, and Survivability).

5. Environmental Quality Needs Process:
   5.1. Needs Identification. By 1 May of each year, AFCEE will solicit needs from the MAJCOM
   Civil Engineers. AFCEE will review the MAJCOM submissions to determine whether solutions
   already exist. If a solution exists for the stated need, AFCEE will provide that information to the
   MAJCOM. Once reviewed and approved by the Environmental Quality Research, Development, and
   Acquisition Working Group and HQ USAF/CE (as outlined in paragraph 5.2.), AFCEE will submit
   needs which require research and development to HSC/XR. HSC/XR and AL will review the needs
   to determine if a mission needs statement is required and notify AFCEE. If a mission needs statement
   is required, AFCEE will request the identifying command generate one and advise the MAJCOM to
   ensure the need is identified in the appropriate Mission Area Plan.

Figure 1. Civil Engineer Research, Development, and Acquisition Process.




   5.2. Needs Prioritization. By 15 August of each year, HQ USAF/CEV will chair the Environmental
   Quality Research, Development, and Acquisition Working Group, with representation from all MAJ-
   COM Civil Engineers, to prioritize existing and new environmental research and development needs.
   The MAJCOM Civil Engineer representatives (i.e., the users) are the sole voting members of this
   forum. The prioritized needs will then be reviewed and approved by HQ USAF/CE. The Working
   Group then passes user prioritized and CE approved needs to the Technology Planning Integrated
   Product Team, chaired by HSC/XR. The Technology Planning Integrated Product Team inserts the
   needs into the AFMC Technology Master Process which converts high ranked needs to projects.
   5.3. Project Prioritization. The Environmental Quality Research, Development, and Acquisition
   Working Group will meet again by 1 December to prioritize Environmental Quality research and
   development projects. The MAJCOM Civil Engineer representatives (i.e., the users) are the sole vot-
   ing members of this forum. Among the topics this meeting will address is the status of technology
   ready to transition from Advanced Technology Development (6.3A) to Demonstration/Validation
   (6.3B), with particular emphasis on funding status and disconnects that might exist as the projects
   transition. HSC/XR and AL will review transitioning projects to determine if an operational require-
   ments document is required and notify AFCEE. If an operational requirements document is required,
   AFCEE will notify the requesting MAJCOM to staff one before 6.3B funds are spent. When the pri-
   oritized project list is final, HSC/XR (Technology Planning Integrated Product Team chair) will
   incorporate it into the Environmental Quality Research, Development, and Acquisition Strategic Plan

                                              6
   and submit the plan to HQ USAF/CE for final approval. In concert with publication of the Strategic
   Plan, HSC/XR will ensure necessary documentation is accomplished to identify funding disconnects
   to AFMC for inclusion in their Program Objective Memorandum. Program element monitors will
   revise program management directives as required to task the appropriate lab or system program
   office to accomplish the projects specified in the Strategic Plan.
   5.4. Budgeting Process. After projects are prioritized, Armstrong Lab will identify Exploratory
   Development (6.2) and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (6.3A) budget disconnects to
   HSC/XR. HSC/XR will consolidate this input with their Demonstration/Validation (6.3B), Engineer-
   ing and Manufacturing Development (6.4), and fielding (e.g., appropriation 3080) disconnects and
   submit funding disconnects for the entire Environmental Quality research, development, and acquisi-
   tion effort to HQ AFMC for inclusion in their Program Objective Memorandum.

6. Air Base Systems Needs Process:
   6.1. Needs Identification. By 1 May of each year, AFCESA will solicit needs from the MAJCOM
   Civil Engineers. AFCESA will review the MAJCOM submissions to determine whether solutions
   already exist. If a solution exists for the stated need, AFCESA will provide that information to the
   MAJCOM. Once reviewed and approved by the Air Base Systems Working Group and HQ USAF/
   CE (as outlined in paragraph 6.2.), AFCESA will submit needs which require research and develop-
   ment to ASC/YO. ASC/YO and WL will review the needs to determine if a mission needs statement
   is required and notify AFCESA. If a mission needs statement is required, AFCESA will request the
   identifying command generate one and advise the MAJCOM to ensure the need is identified in the
   appropriate Mission Area Plan.
   6.2. Needs Prioritization. By 15 August of each year, HQ USAF/CEO will chair the Air Base Sys-
   tems Working Group, with representation from all MAJCOM Civil Engineers, to prioritize existing
   and new Air Base Systems research and development needs. The MAJCOM Civil Engineer represen-
   tatives (i.e., the users) are the sole voting members of this forum. The prioritized needs will then be
   reviewed and approved by HQ USAF/CE. The Air Base Systems Working Group then passes user
   prioritized and CE approved needs to the Technology Planning Integrated Product Team, chaired by
   ASC/YO. The Technology Planning Integrated Product Team inserts the needs into the AFMC Tech-
   nology Master Process which converts the high ranked needs to projects.
   6.3. Project Prioritization. The Air Base Systems Working Group will meet again by 1 December
   of each year to prioritize Air Base Systems projects. The MAJCOM Civil Engineer representatives
   (i.e. the users) are the sole voting members of this forum. Among the topics this meeting will address
   is the status of technology ready to transition from Advanced Technology Development (6.3A) to
   Demonstration/Validation (6.3B), with particular emphasis on funding status and disconnects that
   might exist as the projects transition. ASC/YO and WL will review transitioning projects to deter-
   mine if an operational requirements document is required and notify AFCESA. If an operational
   requirements document is required, AFCESA will notify the requesting MAJCOM to staff one before
   6.3B funds are spent. When the prioritized project list is final, ASC/YO (Technology Planning Inte-
   grated Product Team chair) will incorporate it into the Air Base Systems Strategic Plan and submit the
   plan to HQ USAF/CE for final approval. In concert with publication of the Strategic Plan, ASC/YO
   will ensure necessary documentation is accomplished to identify funding disconnects to HQ AFMC or
   HQ ACC, as applicable, for inclusion in their Program Objective Memorandum. Program element


                                                7
monitors will revise program management directives as required to task the appropriate lab or system
program office to accomplish the projects specified in the Strategic Plan.
6.4. Budgeting Process. After projects are prioritized, Wright Lab will identify Exploratory Devel-
opment (6.2) and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (6.3A) budget disconnects to ASC/
YO. ASC/YO will consolidate this input with their Demonstration/Validation (6.3B), Engineering
and Manufacturing Development (6.4), and fielding (e.g., appropriation 3080) disconnects and submit
funding disconnects for the entire Air Base Systems research, development, and acquisition effort to
HQ AFMC or HQ ACC, as applicable, for inclusion in their Program Objective Memorandum.
