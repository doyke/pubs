SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes include
clarification of Table A2.7. and when Active duty Reserve personnel (serving on a statutory tour) and Air
National Guard personnel serving a Title 10 (assigned to HQ ANGRC) statutory tour receive an annual
clothing replacement allowance. It includes an increase to the "will not exceed" percentage for supple-
mental clothing allowance, clarifies officer entitlement to civilian clothing allowance, grants authority for
an additional exception, and allows Military Training Leaders to receive supplemental clothing allow-
ance. The physical training gear was added and quantity changes were made to various other initial issue
items. The revision adds the requirement for records processing IAW AFMAN 37-123; standardizes para-
graph numbering; establishes a venue for recommending changes; provides additional clarification of ini-
tial, supplemental and annual clothing replacement allowances; updates terminology; and contains other
minor changes. We added the Airman Battle Uniform (ABU) in FY08 and noted deletion timeframe for
BDU items. We added the cash allowance for purses and running shoes.

       PRINCIPLES AND SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS OF CLOTHING ALLOWANCE
                                 PROGRAMS

2.1. Principles and Special Considerations of Clothing Allowance Programs. Current rates for all
clothing allowances are listed in the Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation
7000.14-R, Vol 7A, Chapter 29. Articles of outer clothing issued to the Service member from Government
supply shall be altered to fit the individual at Government expense at the time of sale or issue. The mem-
ber must bear the cost of further alterations, except during initial basic or follow-on training when the
Government may pay for alterations to outer clothing required due to changes in physical profile.
Replacement of the outer clothing is authorized during the first six months of military service when phys-
ical profile changes are such that the cost of alterations would exceed the replacement cost. The member’s
commander must certify that replacement issue is more economical than alterations.
    2.1.1. There are three types of clothing allowances that cover initial and replacement requirements:
       2.1.1.1. Initial clothing allowances.
           2.1.1.1.1. Initial item clothing for enlisted men and women (Table A2.1. and Table A2.2.) are
           issued in Basic Military Training. The annual cash clothing replacement allowance is provided
           to allow individuals to maintain the initial item clothing throughout their career.
       2.1.1.2. Cash clothing replacement allowances.
       2.1.1.3. Supplemental clothing allowances.
    2.1.2. Initial Clothing Allowances. Enlisted personnel shall be furnished an initial clothing allowance
    only under the following circumstances:
       2.1.2.1. Members receive the full Initial Clothing Allowance upon first enlistment in the Service
       or if member reenlists in the same branch of the regular military service and three months has
       expired from the date of discharge or release from active duty. When a Service member enlists
       from an Air Force Reserve component the member shall receive the Partial Initial Clothing Allow-
       ance. ANG or Reserve personnel are not authorized an initial clothing allowance when brought to
       active duty on a statutory tour; uniforms will be issued by their unit prior to starting their statutory
       tour.
       2.1.2.2. Upon being restored to duty, after being sentenced to confinement and punitive discharge,
       the member is entitled to the Partial Initial Clothing Allowance.
       2.1.2.3. Upon reenlisting within three months of the last discharge or release from active duty,
       when the member did not receive the complete initial allowance or was required to turn in cloth-
       ing, the member is entitled to the Partial Initial Clothing Allowance.
       2.1.2.4. Retired enlisted personnel recalled to active duty after three months have expired from
       the date of last release from active duty or retirement are authorized a full initial allowance. Only
       one such allowance shall be authorized during any period of four consecutive years.
       2.1.2.5. Commissioned officers under temporary appointments who enlisted or reenlisted, or who
       reverted to service on active duty in an enlisted status, other than for the purposes of retirement
       (ex: disenrolled ROTC or Air Force Academy cadets) shall receive the Partial Initial Clothing
AFI36-3014 22 MAY 2007                                                                                   5


     Allowance (Table A2.7.). Only one such allowance shall be authorized during any period of four
     consecutive years.
  2.1.3. Except for the Initial Clothing Allowance received at basic military training, Initial or Partial
  Initial Clothing Allowances are credited to the member’s pay account.
  2.1.4. Clothing Replacement Allowances.
     2.1.4.1. The basic clothing replacement allowance is 70 percent of the standard cash clothing
     replacement allowance. It accrues to each enlisted member beginning with the first day of the
     month following the date of completion of six months of active duty without regard to time lost.
     The cash clothing replacement allowance shall continue during the remainder of the first three
     years of continuous active duty, and is payable annually at the applicable fiscal year rate at the end
     of the member’s active duty anniversary month.
     2.1.4.2. The standard cash clothing replacement allowance shall accrue to each enlisted member
     beginning the day after the date the individual completes 36 months of active duty without regard
     to time lost. The 36-month period begins on the date of last authorization to the initial clothing
     allowance and continues during the remaining period of continuous active duty. The standard cash
     clothing replacement allowance is payable annually at the applicable fiscal year rate at the end of
     the member’s anniversary month.
     2.1.4.3. Active duty Reserve personnel (serving on a statutory tour) and Air National Guard per-
     sonnel serving a Title 10 (Members serve on Statutory Tour in other places and are not assigned to
     HQ/ANGRC) and projected to remain on active duty for an additional 12 months will receive an
     annual clothing replacement allowance 1 year from the date members enter active duty.
  2.1.5. Supplemental Clothing Allowance. The supplemental clothing allowance is authorized for
  enlisted persons assigned to duty in a special organization or detail where the nature of the duty neces-
  sitates the member have, as a military requirement, additional quantities or special items of individual
  uniform clothing normally not required for most enlisted members. Attachment 4 lists authorized
  supplemental clothing allowances. Current rates for these allowances are in Department of Defense
  Financial Management Regulation 7000.14-R, Vol 7A, Chapter 29. The supplemental clothing allow-
  ance will not exceed 30 percent of the initial clothing allowance (except for the maternity supplemen-
  tal clothing allowance). The unit commander determines the validity of each enlisted member’s need
  for this extra allowance using the following criteria:
     2.1.5.1. The clothing is needed for an exemplary (rather than creditable) appearance based on
     active military representation before groups of high-ranking military, civic, educational, business
     or foreign dignitaries. NOTE: Active, as used here, means giving presentations, speeches, lec-
     tures, etc., or engaging in official business matters as the center of attention. It does not include
     marching, taking part in social events, or being present when high-ranking military or civilian dig-
     nitaries visit a facility or function.
     2.1.5.2. The individual must wear the uniform(s) full-time under abnormal working conditions or
     duty.
     2.1.5.3. The individual does not receive more than one such allowance for the same basic uniform
     items during any period of continuous active duty unless:
         2.1.5.3.1. The individual reenlists or is recalled after more than 3 months (from date of dis-
         charge or release from active duty) and meets all other requirements for the allowance.
6                                                                         AFI36-3014 22 MAY 2007


       2.1.5.3.2. At least 3 years have lapsed since the initial need for a maternity uniform, and a new
       requirement exists.
       2.1.5.3.3. An individual who transfers from one AFSC or organization to another, in which a
       supplemental clothing allowance is authorized, is entitled to any additional items of the subse-
       quent allowance.
       2.1.5.3.4. A member may be authorized an annual supplementary payment as outlined in
       Table A4.1. On the anniversary of the initial supplementary clothing allowance payment, an
       annual payment may be authorized, provided the member is projected to remain in the qualify-
       ing assignment for at least an additional six months.
           2.1.5.3.4.1. The commander must verify in writing the member is entitled to a supplemen-
           tary clothing allowance, one year has passed since the last payment, and the member is
           projected to remain in the qualifying assignment for an additional six months.
    2.1.5.4. The Maternity Supplemental Clothing Allowance. Enlisted pregnant members must pur-
    chase the maternity jumper and one long sleeve blue maternity blouse. This combination serves as
    their service dress uniform. At the member’s election, with the approval of the commander or first
    sergeant, the remaining balance of the maternity allowance may be used to purchase uniform arti-
    cles required for performance of duty. This allowance is paid only once in a three-year period; sub-
    sequent payment entitlement is based on the actual date of disbursement of previous payment(s).
    2.1.5.5. Processing Requests for Approval of a New Supplemental Clothing Allowance. Send
    requests for new or revised supplemental clothing allowances, through command channels to: HQ
    USAF/A1DO, 1040 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1040. In preparing these requests
    the following information/statements should be included as a minimum:
       2.1.5.5.1. That uniform clothing cost is abnormal.
       2.1.5.5.2. A list of the uniform items needed and quantities desired.
       2.1.5.5.3. A statement describing how or why the current initial item uniform clothing allow-
       ance is inadequate.
       2.1.5.5.4. The (average) daily duty hours and the number of days a week the individual per-
       forms duties. (This indicates how often regular duty uniforms are worn.)
       2.1.5.5.5. The mandatory uniforms prescribed for wear.
       2.1.5.5.6. The average number of days during the year each special/distinctive uniform is
       worn.
       2.1.5.5.7. The average number of days prescribed uniforms are worn between cleanings.
       2.1.5.5.8. The extra uniform allowances authorized for enlisted members of other branches of
       service involved in the same or similar duties (if any).
       2.1.5.5.9. Any alternative considered for reducing the impact of the uniform requirements on
       the individual.
       2.1.5.5.10. The names or titles of specific dignitaries and high-ranking officials, and their fre-
       quency of contact involved with the individual’s duties.
       2.1.5.5.11. The number of personnel for which the allowance is desired.

                        CIVILIAN CLOTHING ALLOWANCE PROGRAM

3.1. Civilian Clothing Allowance (CCA) Program. Air Force personnel must wear appropriate Air
Force uniforms while performing military duties. However, there are times, for reasons such as security or
safety, when members must wear civilian clothes. When competent authority determines the wear of civil-
ian clothes is mandatory to perform assigned duties, enlisted personnel may receive a civilian clothing
allowance if they meet the eligibility criteria in paragraph 3.3. Section 419 of Title 37, United States
Code, limits civilian clothing allowance entitlement for officers to those "assigned to a permanent duty
station at a location outside the United States." ANG/USAFR enlisted members may only receive a civil-
ian clothing allowance if on active duty for 180 consecutive days or more.
   3.1.1. The Military Personnel Flight will automatically authorize a civilian clothing allowance for
   enlisted personnel when:
       3.1.1.1. The Foreign Clearance Guide mandates civilian clothing at the member’s duty location.
       3.1.1.2. The Joint US Military Assistance Advisory Group certifies a requirement for civilian
       clothing.
       3.1.1.3. A member is assigned to the White House Communications Agency.
       3.1.1.4. The Personnel Processing Code (PPC) indicates civilian clothing must be worn. (For
       officers to automatically receive a civilian clothing allowance they must be permanently assigned
       to a duty location outside the United States in addition to meeting one of the above criteria.)
   3.1.2. Competent Authority for determining duty requiring the wear of civilian clothing:
       3.1.2.1. MAJCOM Deputy Chiefs of Staff
       3.1.2.2. Assistant Defense of Service Secretaries
       3.1.2.3. Deputy Chiefs of Staff or their Assistants, HQ USAF
       3.1.2.4. US Ambassador or equivalent
       3.1.2.5. US Government Agency, the United Nations, or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
       3.1.2.6. Headquarters, Defense Intelligence Agency
       3.1.2.7. Commander, Air Force Office of Special Investigations
       3.1.2.8. United States Secret Service
       3.1.2.9. HQ USAF office of primary responsibility. For projects, exercises or training assign-
       ments, the applicable HQ USAF office of primary responsibility must provide written authority
       (TDY instructions, tasking) making the wear of civilian clothing mandatory, and reconfirm this
       requirement every 12 months for continuing projects, exercises, or training assignments.
   3.1.3. Civilian Clothing Allowances. There are three types of civilian clothing allowance payments:
   permanent duty, replacement permanent duty and temporary duty (TDY). Current rates for civilian
   clothing allowances are listed in the Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation
   7000.14-R, Vol 7A, Chapter 29.
8                                                                        AFI36-3014 22 MAY 2007


    3.1.3.1. Permanent Duty Civilian Clothing Allowance. This allowance is designed for personnel
    who are directed by competent authority to perform their duty in civilian clothing at least 50 per-
    cent of their duty time. Upon assignment to permanent duty qualifying a member for a civilian
    clothing allowance, members may receive a permanent duty civilian clothing allowance.
       3.1.3.1.1. A permanent duty civilian clothing allowance shall not be paid more than one time
       in any 3-year period, or if the member has been out of a qualifying permanent assignment for
       less than 12 months. If the member receives a follow-on permanent duty assignment requiring
       the wear of civilian clothing within three years of receiving an initial permanent duty civilian
       clothing allowance, or within 12 months of occupying a qualifying permanent assignment, the
       member will continue to be paid the permanent duty replacement civilian clothing allowance
       on the original anniversary date.
       3.1.3.1.2. As an exception to paragraphs 3.1.3., the Office of the Assistant Secretary of
       Defense, Force Management and Personnel (ASD FMP) may authorize payment of the initial
       permanent duty civilian clothing allowance and up to two replacement allowance payments in
       an up-front lump sum to members projected to continue to meet the eligibility criteria for a
       civilian clothing allowance on a "career" basis. Such a lump-sum payment will be made only
       one time in a member’s career and that is when the member first becomes eligible for the civil-
       ian clothing allowance. On the first and second anniversaries of a lump-sum initial payment, if
       it is determined the member will not actually be remaining in a qualifying civilian clothing
       allowance position for at least the next six months, the annual unearned portion of the year(s)
       not served in the qualifying assignment will be recouped from the member. On the third and
       subsequent duty anniversaries of the member eligible for the allowance, the member will be
       paid the permanent duty replacement civilian clothing allowance. Initial Lump-Sum payment
       requests should be forwarded to ASD (FMP) staffed through the member’s major command or
       equivalent, HQ USAF/A1 and CSAF, and the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force. Disap-
       proval authority for the initial Lump-Sum payment is any level in the member’s chain of com-
       mand, including the Air Staff level.
           3.1.3.1.2.1. Enlisted OSI agents, upon graduation from technical school, receive the initial
           permanent duty civilian clothing allowance and two replacement allowance payments in
           an up-front lump sum. Such a lump-sum payment is authorized only one time in a mem-
           ber’s career. On the third and subsequent duty anniversaries, the member will be paid the
           permanent duty replacement civilian clothing allowance.
       3.1.3.1.3. Member’s who receive a TDY civilian clothing allowance within the preceding 12
       months of commencing an assignment authorizing a permanent duty civilian clothing allow-
       ance will have the permanent duty civilian clothing allowance offset by the applicable prevail-
       ing temporary duty civilian clothing allowance. Likewise, member’s who receive the
       permanent duty civilian clothing allowance are not authorized payment of a TDY civilian
       clothing allowance within the next 12 months.
           3.1.3.1.3.1. An exception to paragraph 3.1.3.1.2. is if it can be clearly demonstrated the
           type of clothing needed for the permanent duty and the TDY are entirely different. In this
           case Competent Authority can authorize full payment of either allowance.
    3.1.3.2. Replacement Permanent Duty Civilian Clothing Allowance. On the annual anniversary
    month of the member commencing the qualifying assignment, a replacement permanent duty
AFI36-3014 22 MAY 2007                                                                                9


     civilian clothing allowance is payable if the member is projected to serve at least six additional
     months in a qualifying permanent duty assignment. The replacement permanent duty civilian
     clothing allowance equals one-third of the initial permanent duty civilian clothing allowance. If
     the member is projected to remain in the assignment less than six months beyond the anniversary
     month, the replacement civilian clothing allowance is not authorized. However, if the member
     actually serves six or more months in the assignment past the anniversary month, the replacement
     allowance will be paid, changing the member’s anniversary date to the date the allowance was
     actually paid. Commanders must certify in writing each time members are authorized to receive
     the Replacement Permanent Duty Civilian Clothing Allowance. Certification must include a state-
     ment members are projected to remain in the assignment six months or more.
     3.1.3.3. Temporary Duty Civilian Clothing Allowances. Generally, the TDY allowance is for use
     when the permanent allowance is not applicable. TDY clothing allowances are not granted for
     entire squadrons or work sections; they are approved only on a case-by-case basis. Section 419 of
     Title 37, United States Code limits officer’s eligibility for TDY civilian clothing allowance to
     those that “are assigned to permanent duty station at a location outside the United States.”
        3.1.3.3.1. When competent authority determines civilian clothing is necessary for TDY of at
        least 15 consecutive days or 15 accumulative days within a 30 day period, the maximum
        amount payable shall be one-third of the initial permanent duty civilian clothing allowance.
        Do not authorize payment for in-flight stopovers where civilian clothes must be worn. Mem-
        ber must present supporting documentation (e.g. travel orders) for payment of the 15 day accu-
        mulative TDY in a 30 day period entitlement.
            3.1.3.3.1.1. The 15-day qualification requirement does not apply to Explosive Ordnance
            Disposal and Explosive Detector Dog personnel on United States Secret Service Support
            duty, Defense Courier Service couriers, or Defense Threat Reduction Agency military per-
            sonnel; these personnel may be authorized up to the maximum temporary duty civilian
            clothing allowance for 30 days upon their initial TDY travel requirement.
        3.1.3.3.2. When competent authority (Command or equivalent directing the TDY) determines
        civilian clothing is required for TDY 30 or more consecutive or accumulative days in any
        36-month period, the maximum amount payable is two-thirds the initial permanent duty civil-
        ian clothing allowance, less any amount paid within the past 36-month period for TDY civilian
        clothing allowance. Do not authorize payment for in-flight stopovers where civilian clothes
        must be worn. The member must present supporting documentation (e.g. travel orders) for
        payment when claiming TDY for 30 accumulative days in a 36-month period.
        3.1.3.3.3. The maximum amount payable in civilian clothing allowances for all TDYs per-
        formed in any 36-month period will not exceed the maximum prescribed for the 30-day
        period. However, in exceptional circumstances, the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force may
        make an exception to the 36-month payment rule and authorize an additional TDY payment.
        Requests for the exception to the 36-month payment rule should be routed through the Major
        Command or equivalent, HQ USAF/A1D, the appropriate Air Staff functional DCS, to the
        Assistant Secretary of the Air Force. Disapproval authority is at any level in the chain of com-
        mand, to include the Air Staff level.

     3.1.4. During the period an enlisted member is required to wear civilian clothing, the cash clothing
     replacement allowance continues to accrue because these individuals are still required to maintain a
     full set of current uniform items.
     3.1.5. Compute entitlement for the TDY allowance using any of the following criteria:
        3.1.5.1. The date of first payment of a TDY allowance.
        3.1.5.2. The date departed TDY.
        3.1.5.3. The date of performance of duty requiring the wear of civilian clothing.
