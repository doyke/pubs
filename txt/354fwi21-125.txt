This instruction establishes policy and procedures to support H-70 familiarization training, leak
detection, spills, and recovery of F-16 aircraft after operation of the Emergency Power Unit
(EPU). It implements AFPD21-1, Air and Space Maintenance and applies to all personnel and
units assigned, attached, or tenant to the 354th Fighter Wing. In situations where the Hydrazine
Response Team (HRT) leader determines this instruction does not adequately cover procedures
for the particular situation, authority is granted to add to or deviate from the procedures when
safety of personnel or damage to equipment is involved. This publication does not apply to the
Air National Guard or US Air Force Reserve. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition
Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route

2. Definition of H-70. H-70 is a clear, oily liquid having an ammonia-like odor that is
corrosive, combustible and highly toxic. A major spill is considered 1 liter or more, minor spill
is considered 1 liter or less.
                                            WARNING

                        Non-essential personnel shall leave the
                        immediate area to avoid breathing H-70
                        vapors. Failure to do so may result in
                        personal injury. Personnel will exercise care
                        to ensure that H-70 does not come in contact
                        with skin or eyes. All EPU firings and
                        suspected H-70 leaks will be treated as
                        definite leaks until the HRT team determines
                        otherwise.
3. H-70 Training. All aircraft maintenance and aircraft fuel systems personnel will receive
familiarization training in the hazards of H-70. All unit commanders will ensure that personnel
with duties in the proximity of F-16 aircraft or H-70 also receive training.
     3.1. The 354 MXG/MXOT will provide initial H-70 familiarization training for all
     personnel, including fire protection personnel.
     3.2. The 354 MXS/MXMCF, 354 CES/CED (EOD), 354 MDOS/SGOAB, and354
     CES/CEF will provide in-shop specialized training as required.
4. Designated Areas.
     4.1. Recovering aircraft with a fired emergency power unit (EPU): If the aircraft is landing
     on runway 32, it will be parked on the primary hot cargo pad, the secondary location will be
     the arming spot close to the runway with the aircraft pointing into the wind on taxiway “A”.
     If the aircraft is landing on runway 14, it will be parked on taxiway “E” or its alternate, the
     hot brake/arming area. After HRT has positively identified that there is no evidence of H-70
     leakage, the aircraft will be directed to taxi or be towed to the nearest routine EPU
     maintenance area.
     4.2. EPU Maintenance: The F-16 H-70 maintenance areas are located on Alpha row spot 1,
     bay 8, building 1344 fuel shop, Trim pad (Fox hardstand), or Charlie row. Spot 1 will be
     used as de-arm and/or emergency H-70 bottle depressurization area only. The aircraft will
     then be towed to the primary maintenance location building 1344. In the event that 1344 is
     unavailable the alternates; bay 8, Trim pad (Fox Hardstand), or Charlie row will be utilized
     in that order. Aircraft must be located away from mass parking areas and aircraft loaded
     with live munitions. EPU maintenance will be restricted to concrete pads in alternate
     locations. These areas will be utilized to perform maintenance including: H-70 tank
     emergency depressurization and replacement, purge and coupling disconnects, and mono-
     propellant checks. Bays 2 thru 12 can be utilized for EPU mono checks H-70 fuel line hook
     up, and nitrogen line hook up.

   4.3. Authorized Storage Area: Building 1344 is the only facility on Eielson AFB authorized
   for the storage of H-70.

       5.10.2. Once the Incident Commander has ensured aircraft is safe, HRT will investigate
       suspected leak by the most appropriate means.
6. Initial Actions:
   6.1. Ensure aircraft has been safed by the Fire Department.
       6.1.1. Once cleared by the Incident Commander, HRT enters the area and
       visually/mechanically checks all areas for traces of H-70 (visual, litmus paper, Draeger
       tester). HRT team supervisor will inform the Incident Commander of the test results.
   6.2. Fired EPU with no H-70 leak detected.
       6.2.1. When notified by the HRT supervisor the Incident Commander will announce over
       the crash net there is no H-70 leak and terminate the ground emergency.
       6.2.2. The aircraft will remain running.
       6.2.3. The AMU Superintendent will direct the pilot to taxi to the nearest H-70 servicing
       area (see section 4.1/4.2). The Fire Department and HRT will follow the aircraft to that
       location.
       6.2.4. If the aircraft is unable to be taxied due to the nature of the emergency the Fire
       Department will instruct the pilot to shut down the aircraft and egress the pilot normally
       from the cockpit. Crash Recovery or qualified tow team will be required to tow the
       aircraft to the nearest H-70 servicing area.
       6.2.5. Upon arrival, the Fire Department will:
           6.2.5.1. Chalk the left main gear, HRT will recheck the aircraft for evidence of
           leakage.
       6.2.5.2. If no leak is detected the aircraft will be shutdown normally by the AMU.
       After the pilot has cleared the area, HRT will perform the H-70 bottle emergency
       depressurization.
 6                                                              354FWI 21-125 7 MARCH 2012


        6.2.5.3.   Once HRT declares all clear, the Fire Department can return to station.
     6.3. Fired EPU with H-70 leak visually detected.
        6.3.1. The pilot will shut down the engine when the Incident Commander is prepared to
        egress the pilot using a portable oxygen bottle.
        6.3.2. Egress the pilot
        6.3.3. Once shutdown, the Incident Commander will ensure EOD personnel safe all
        ordnance as required.
        6.3.4. HRT will perform emergency depressurization the H-70 tank, contain any leaks,
        and perform cleanup/neutralization procedures as required.
        6.3.5. Once spill has been contained and neutralized, BIO will test aircraft and
        surrounding area for residual presence of H-70 to verify neutralization has been
        accomplished.
7. Deployment Requirements.
     7.1. A three-member team with an approved H-70 detection unit, spill kit and personnel
     protective equipment will accompany all F-16 deployments consisting of four or more
     aircraft, lasting more than a week, if the deployed location has no H-70 support capability.
     7.2. Immediately upon arrival at a non-F-16 base, the senior HRT member will coordinate
     with the host base representative for a briefing on the dangers of H-70 and procedures for
     spills and leak responses.
     7.3. The Fuel System Repair Section will develop and maintain at least one kit for H-70
     leaks in coordination with base BEE. The H-70 kit will be mobile and readily available for
     dispatch.
8. EPU Mono Tester Maintenance.
     8.1. To reduce the possibility of personnel becoming exposed to H-70 vapors, the following
     precautions must be adhered to:
        8.1.1. The EPU Mono test set must be tested for H-70 vapors after every use. If H-70 is
        present, the equipment must be purged by qualified 2A6X4 personnel.
        8.1.2. Calibration of the EPU test set will not be accomplished until the tester has been
        purged by qualified personnel.
                                          WARNING

                        Failure to purge EPU test set properly may
                        result in injury of personnel or damage to
                        equipment.
        8.1.3. Purged testers will have an AFTO Form 244 and 350 tag that will be annotated to
        reflect the date used and date purged.
9. Procedures in the event of personnel being exposed to H-70.
     9.1. Exposed personnel will be isolated in an area upwind and away from the contaminated
     area and will undergo medical evaluation.
