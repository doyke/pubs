1.1. Concept.
   1.1.1. The Deputy Airfield Manager (19 OSS/OSAA), or designated representative, is the
   Office of Primary Responsibility for the Little Rock AFB Airfield Driving Program. The
   Deputy Airfield Manager trains and certifies unit Airfield Driving Program Managers. Unit
   Airfield Driving Program Managers will, in turn, manage their unit programs and train and
   certify unit personnel who have an operational requirement to drive on the airfield.
   1.1.2. The goal of the airfield driving program is to create a safe driving environment for
   aircraft and vehicle operations. Safe operation of motor vehicles on the airfield is absolutely
   critical. Motor vehicles present a clear and definite danger, both to aircraft and ground

   drivers is inexcusable and are primary sources of aircraft-vehicle collisions and/or incidents
   and personnel injury.
   1.1.3. This instruction pertains to all motor vehicles on the airfield. Only properly trained
   and certified personnel will drive on the Little Rock AFB airfield, and they will be
   knowledgeable of and comply with this instruction. All personnel operating a vehicle must
   be trained on local driving procedures and possess a valid AF IMT 483, Certificate of
   Competency, endorsed for airfield driving before operating any vehicle on the airfield. This
   requirement applies to military, civilian, and contractor personnel who are assigned to,
   visiting, or on temporary duty to this base, and applies to drivers of military, commercial, and
   privately owned vehicles.
   1.1.4. Personnel acting as an escort must also be authorized and certified to drive on the
   airfield and be fully aware of associated responsibilities found in paragraph 3.16. in this
   instruction.
1.2. Responsibilities.
   1.2.1. Wing Commander.
       1.2.1.1. Responsibilities are outlined in AFI 13-213 paragraph 2.3. Specific items include

          CONTROLLED MOVEMENT AREA/VEHICLE CONTROL AREA

4.1. General.
   4.1.1. Controlled Movement Area (CMA): The following areas on the airfield are part of the
   Tower CMA: Runway, Assault Zone, Taxiways Alpha through Echo, grassy areas north of
   Taxiway Foxtrot (except fuel facilities outlined in Attachment 5), and the eastern portion of
   Taxiway Foxtrot beginning at the CMA boundary marking. Additional areas include
   Taxiway Golf from Echo to the entrance (marked by the CMA boundary marking) of the
   Christmas Tree Apron. The CMA continues west, north, and east from these areas to the tree
   line around the airfield. See Attachment 5.

Figure 4.1. Controlled Movement Area Diagram




      4.1.1.1. Vehicle operators intending to operate within the CMA must establish and
      maintain direct two-way radio contact with the control tower (or contact Security Forces
      Control Center during airfield closures) and receive approval prior to entering any portion
      of the CMA. Note: Use of intermediary agencies (AM Ops, MOC, Command Post, etc.)
      to contact Tower and gain access into the CMA is not authorized.
      4.1.1.2. Vehicles crossing the runway will be kept to an absolute minimum. Crossing the
      runway for convenience is prohibited. The perimeter road will be used to travel to the
      opposite side of the airfield unless time is of the essence or the responding vehicle is too
      large to transit by the perimeter road.
      4.1.1.3. Vehicle operators will remain in radio contact with the Tower at all times while
      operating within the CMA.
      4.1.1.4. Vehicles without direct two-way radio contact with the Tower may be escorted
      by a vehicle meeting this requirement. Vehicle operators escorted within the CMA will
      remain in visual and voice contact with the escort vehicle operator and will adhere to all
      escort instructions. The escort vehicle operator will maintain positive control over all
      escorted vehicles at all times. After obtaining control tower approval for crossing, the
30                                            LITTLEROCKAFBI13-213 9 JANUARY 2014


     escort vehicle will ensure all vehicles cross the runway. The escort vehicle will notify the
     Control Tower when all vehicles are beyond the established hold lines.
     4.1.1.5. Vehicles operating in any CMA area will use installed vehicle lighting
     (headlights, emergency flashers, and/or emergency rotating beacons) to maximize their
     contrast to the landing environment. Special care must be taken during periods of
     restricted visibility when control tower and pilot visibility of the landing area is degraded.
     4.1.1.6. Vehicles requesting to cross the runway at a specific location will do so
     expeditiously after receiving control tower approval. Vehicles anticipating travel along
     the length of the runway will advise the tower upon initial request.
     4.1.1.7. Any personnel requiring access inside the CMA when the airfield, the control
     tower, and Airfield Management are closed must coordinate with Security Forces Control
     Center (SFCC)/Law Enforcement Desk (LED) (987-3221) prior to entering and leaving
     the CMA (includes Meteorological and Navigational Aid (METNAV) Maintenance,
     Airfield Lighting, CE Horizontal Shop, etc.). Individual will provide name, rank,
     organization, contact information, radio call sign, description of vehicle, location, and
     reason for airfield access. SFS will verify individual against agency specific
     authorization letter on file. If individual is not listed, CMA access will be denied.
         4.1.1.7.1. Any unit with personnel who may require access inside the CMA during an
         airfield closure must provide an access authorization letter to SFS and AM. Units
         will ensure the letter is updated as necessary (Attachment 11). Note: SFS and Fire
         Department are exempt from filing an authorization access letter but must inform SFS
         duty desk of CMA entry/exit using dedicated hotlines.
         4.1.1.7.2. SFS, AMOPS, and control tower responsibilities regarding the transfer of
         CMA control during airfield opening/closure are explained in LRAFBI 13-250,
         Airfield Operations and Local Flying Procedures.
         4.1.1.7.3. The Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ) is an 800 foot wide by 200 foot
         long rectangular area centered on the runway centerline, beginning at and extending
         outward from the Rwy 25 threshold, designed to protect aircraft flying precision
         approaches from vehicles interrupting the approach signals only when the cloud
         ceiling is less than 300 feet or visibility is less than ¾ statute mile (or runway visual
         range below 4,000 feet). See Attachment 7 for the location of the POFZ.
             4.1.1.7.3.1. Non-essential vehicle operators will obtain permission from tower to
             enter the POFZ (which is penetrated while transiting the east end perimeter road
             or holding short of the runway at Txy E) prior to entering the POFZ. Ground
             vehicles essential to airport operations are excluded from this requirement.
             Essential vehicles include those vehicles necessary for the maintenance of the
             airport and navigation facilities, but do not include non-essential vehicles such as
             construction, refueling vehicles, or mowers.
  4.1.2. Vehicle Control Area (VCA): The grassy areas south of Taxiway Foxtrot, east and
  west of the parking apron, to the tree line south of the airfield. Additional areas include the
  Christmas Tree and all fuel pump houses/maintenance facilities, with direct access from non-
  CMA portions of Taxiway Foxtrot (Attachment 5).
LITTLEROCKAFBI13-213 9 JANUARY 2014                                                          31


      4.1.2.1. Vehicles operating in this area are not required to have contact with the Tower
      (or Security Forces Control Center/Law Enforcement Desk during airfield closure);
      however, driver requirements and vehicle movements must be IAW this instruction.
4.2. Vehicle Communications Procedures.
   4.2.1. Strict radio discipline is mandatory. No Citizen Band (CB), sarcastic, superfluous,
   obscene, or deceptive transmissions will be made.
   4.2.2. To eliminate miscommunications and possible compromised safety, it is imperative
   that Air Traffic Control phraseology be adhered to (see Attachment 6). Under no
   circumstances will a vehicle be driven onto the runway or any portion of the CMA if there is
   any uncertainty concerning approval. If for any reason you do not clearly hear what Tower
   says on the radio, you should reply with “SAY AGAIN." If communications are confusing,
   stop and ask for clarification.
   4.2.3. Normal communications to the control tower will be initiated with appropriate call
   sign (who is making the call), present location (where the caller is), and request (what the
   caller wants to do).
   4.2.4. The normal word authorizing a vehicle to operate near, enter, or cross any CMA is
   “PROCEED.” The word “PROCEED” may be accompanied with other words or phrases.
   4.2.5. “HOLD” will indicate disapproval of an operator’s request. “HOLD” may be
   accompanied with other words or phrases; however, if this word is used, vehicle operators
   WILL NOT ENTER THE CMA.
   4.2.6. Vehicle operators will use call signs found in Attachment 14, Airfield Radio Call
   Signs. New or temporary call signs (such as those used by contractors, TDY personnel, etc.)
   not pre-established in Attachment 14 or LRAFBI 33-101, Radio Call Signs must be approved
   by the Airfield Manager or designated representative to ensure duplicate call signs are not
   being used.
   4.2.7. Vehicle operators must acknowledge Tower’s instructions by reading them back
   verbatim prior to moving the vehicle. This read back is to confirm the vehicle operator
   received Tower’s message correctly. If the read back is incorrect, Tower needs enough time
   to correct the driver before the vehicle moves.
   4.2.8. When reporting off the runway or other CMA, vehicle operators will ensure Tower
   acknowledges their transmission and understand the vehicle has exited the CMA.
   4.2.9. If other vehicles will accompany the vehicle requesting access to an area, the vehicle
   operator (escort) must say the word, “PLUS” and the number of vehicles they are escorting
   (for example: “OPS 1 PLUS 2”).
   4.2.10. Never use the words “CLEAR,” “CLEARED,” “CLEARING,” or “CLEARANCE.”
   These words are used by air traffic control in communication only with aircraft.
4.3. Control Tower Light Gun Signals.
   4.3.1. Light gun signals are used by the control tower to control vehicle traffic within the
   Controlled Movement Area during vehicle/control tower communication failures.
 32                                           LITTLEROCKAFBI13-213 9 JANUARY 2014


   4.3.2. All vehicles will display the AFVA 11-240, USAF Airport Signs and Markings
   (includes light gun signals) decal (Attachment 13) and AFVA 13-222, Runway/Controlled
   Movement Area Procedures, in plain view of the driver. Drivers will know and comply with
   the depicted signals.
   4.3.3. The decal may be permanently affixed in plain view of the driver or clipped to the
   inside of the sun visor on the driver’s side of the vehicle so it can be flipped down for ready
   reference.
   4.3.4. If vehicles on the runway do not respond to light gun signals, the control tower will
   raise and lower the intensity of the runway edge lights or turn the edge lights on and off.
   This signal means to immediately exit the runway and establish communications with the
   tower.
4.4. Tower and Vehicle Radio Blocked/Visual Blind Areas.
   4.4.1. Little Rock AFB Airfield does not have any known control tower or vehicle radio
   blocked areas, but does have a visual blind area west of Hanger 250 and the Christmas tree
   apron.
4.5. Procedures for Airfield Emergencies. Agencies responding to emergencies on the airfield
will use the following procedures:
   4.5.1. Airfield Management. Airfield Management personnel will respond to the approach
   end of the runway to await the arrival of in-flight emergencies (when possible). Airfield
   Management will enter the runway when instructed to do so by the ATCT.
   4.5.2. Security Forces. Security Forces will not respond onto the runway unless specifically
   requested by the incident commander (IC) or Airfield Management. The SFS response
   vehicle will position itself at parking rows Papa and Romeo. SFS will wait for further
   instructions from the IC or Airfield Management.
   4.5.3. Ambulance. The Ambulance will respond between Parking Rows Papa and Romeo
   and await further instructions from the IC. At no time shall the ambulance proceed to the
   runway without being requested to do so by the IC. If the IC requests ambulance support, the
   ambulance must request permission from the ATCT before entering the CMA.
   4.5.4. Safety. Safety Office personnel will position themselves at the most appropriate
   location of the emergency. Safety may proceed once the aircraft has landed and ATCT
   permission has been granted to enter the runway.
   4.5.5. Fire Department. Fire Department personnel (Chief 1, Chief 2, etc.) will establish
   command and designate themselves as the Incident Commander (IC) for in-flight and
   ground emergencies. The Fire Department vehicles will respond to standby locations as
   directed by the IC.      Fire Department personnel or IC will contact ATCT and request
   approval for lead vehicle and following responders to enter the active runway or CMA.

   unsafe driving practices immediately and reporting to AM Operations (987-6123), Security
   Forces (987-3221) and19 AW Safety (987-6176). Commanders, unit ADPMs, AMOPS, and
   SFS personnel have authority to revoke airfield driving privileges for violations.
   5.1.2. Airfield Management, Safety, and Security Forces personnel (regardless of rank) have
   the authority to confiscate any individual’s AF IMT 483, pending an investigation of the
   violation.
   5.1.3. Security Forces will issue a DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket, to any
   vehicle operator they observe violating provisions of this instruction.
   5.1.4. Unit Airfield Driving Program Managers should use violation trend data to self
   evaluate their unit’s training program.
   5.1.5. Contractor vehicle operators violating the rules of this instruction can be banned from
   operating vehicles on the airfield. The contractor will then be responsible for providing
   replacement driver(s).
5.2. Runway Incursions.
   5.2.1. Definition of terms:
      5.2.1.1. Controlled Movement Area Violation (CMAV): An airfield violation caused by
      aircraft, vehicles, or pedestrians entering the CMA without specific control tower
      approval. This definition includes runway incursions and infractions caused by
      communications errors.
      5.2.1.2. Runway Incursion: A CMAV that involves the incorrect presence of an aircraft,
      vehicle, or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-
      off of aircraft. For the purpose of this instruction, the protected area is the same as the
      CMA. These are further classified into three operational categories (Operational Error,
      Pilot Deviation, and Vehicle/Pedestrian).
      5.2.1.3. ATC approval is required at all times, even during suspended/closed operations.
      Emergency response vehicle operators still require ATC approval to enter the runway or
      CMA when responding to an emergency/incident.
      5.2.1.4. Vehicle operators must not follow other emergency response vehicles on the
      runway or CMA unless they have pre-arranged procedures for escort/convoy.
      5.2.1.5. Poor communication.      Some examples of poor communication include
      misunderstanding Control Tower’s instructions, mixing up vehicle call signs and vehicle
      drivers anticipating the approval to enter the runway before Tower actually grants
      approval.
 34                                           LITTLEROCKAFBI13-213 9 JANUARY 2014

       Error, Pilot Deviation, and Vehicle/Pedestrian Deviation) for trend analysis.
   5.3.5. The DAFM and/or the Safety office will conduct an investigation by gathering data
   from involved agencies.
   5.3.6. After the investigation, the DAFM will determine the corrective course of action and
   notify all appropriate agencies.
   5.3.7. Any further administrative action is at the discretion of the unit commander.
   5.3.8. Airfield Management will (via the ADTP) produce/maintain a copy of the AF IMT
   651s/457s, action taken, results and supporting documentation in accordance with Air Force
   RDS, Table 13-06, Rule 15.00.
   5.3.9. All runway incursions and controlled movement area violations will be briefed to the
   19 OG/CC at the quarterly AOB, at semi-annual VCO/VCNCO, and ADPM meetings. A
   detailed description including unit, what, when, where, how, type vehicle/aircraft involved
   and action taken to prevent a re-occurrence will be in the briefing. Trends will be
   highlighted. Copies of all forms/reports will be kept at Airfield Management.
5.4. Enforcement.
   5.4.1. For a runway incursion that had an adverse affect on flight operations (arrivals,
   departures, etc.), the control tower will submit an AF Form 651, Hazard Air Traffic Report,

                         TDY AND CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL

6.1. TDY Personnel.
   6.1.1. Personnel not permanently assigned to Little Rock AFB and requesting to operate a
   vehicle on the airfield must possess a valid AF IMT 483 (or service equivalent) from their
   home station for authorization to drive on the airfield. In such instances, the unit ADPM
   supporting the requestor(s) will conduct a local airfield driving briefing/airfield driving
   orientation to operate a vehicle without an escort. The unit ADPM will use a MFR, log, or
   electronic equivalent to document the name/unit of the individuals that received the
   briefing/training with an expiration date (length of TDY) and forward a copy to the DAFM
   for issuance of a temporary AF IMT 483 for “Ramp Access Only.”
   6.1.2. Airfield Management may provide the local airfield driving briefing/orientation only
   when the requesting personnel are not tied to a specific unit (e.g. higher headquarters,
   inspector general, Green Flag Little Rock/Joint Readiness Center participants, etc.) or when
   driving route(s) do not permit access on or across the CMA. Note: If the requestor is not
   assigned to a specific unit (e.g. higher headquarters, inspector general, etc.) the host
   wing/group will determine which of their respective units will accomplish training or provide
   escorts. Airfield Management personnel do not provide escorts or perform escort duties.
   6.1.3. At a minimum, the local briefing/orientation will include the following:
      6.1.3.1. Airfield signs and markings (Paragraphs 3.1. and 3.2.).
      6.1.3.2. Speed limits for aprons, taxiways, runways, and towing operations (Paragraphs
      3.7. and 8.2.).
      6.1.3.3. Operating vehicles in vicinity of aircraft (Chapter 3 and Attachment 8).

      6.1.3.7. Runway incursion prevention (Chapter 5).
      6.1.3.8. Airfield violations and consequences (Chapter 5).
      6.1.3.9. Light gun signals (Paragraph 4.3. and Attachment 13).
      6.1.3.10. Controlled Movement Area procedures (Chapter 4 and Attachment 5).
      6.1.3.11. Vehicle Control Area procedures (Chapter 4 and Attachment 5).
      6.1.3.12. CMA proper radio terminology and phraseology (Attachment 6).
      6.1.3.13. Airfield diagram (Attachment 7).
6.2. Non-base Assigned Contract Personnel. .
   6.2.1. Non-base assigned contractors who require access on or across the CMA must possess
   an AF IMT 483 and be trained on local airfield driving procedures same as base assigned
LITTLEROCKAFBI13-213 9 JANUARY 2014                                                            37


  personnel to operate a vehicle on the airfield without an escort. The host or sponsoring unit’s
  (unit requiring contractor’s services) ADPM will conduct the required training.
     6.2.1.1. Upon successful completion of all training and certification requirements, the
     contractor will be issued an AF IMT 483, stamped “Airfield Driving."
  6.2.2. Non-base assigned contractors who do not require access on or across the CMA or
  will only access the CMA with a qualified escort, must receive a local briefing and practical
  driving orientation (will vary based on work site location) from Airfield Management prior to
  driving on the airfield.
     6.2.2.1. Each contractor and subcontractor must receive and sign an Airfield
     Construction Briefing Guide (Attachment 9) and be issued an AF IMT 483, stamped
     “Non-CMA” or “Ramp Access Only” prior to driving on the airfield.
  6.2.3. Each contractor/subcontractor operating a non-government (except as stated in 6.2.5)
  vehicle must obtain a vehicle cone from Airfield Management (Building 120) prior to driving
  on the airfield.
  6.2.4. Contractors and subcontractors must follow the route(s) established by Airfield
  Management to and from the work site.
  6.2.5. Contractor delivery/haul vehicles (cement trucks, asphalt trucks, lumber trucks, dump
  trucks, etc.) do not require a vehicle cone provided they are escorted to/from the work site by
  the primary contractor.
     6.2.5.1. In cases where the number of delivery vehicles and distance to/from the work
     site makes individual escort impractical, the primary contractor is authorized “Line of
     Sight” escort provided the following procedures are followed:
         6.2.5.1.1. Drivers adhere to all airfield safety guidelines.
         6.2.5.1.2. Drivers access only the pre-approved travel route to/from the work site.
         6.2.5.1.3. Primary contractor positions personnel along the haul route at any location
         delivery vehicles could potentially come into conflict with safe aircraft operations. If
         applicable, these locations will be identified to the contractor by Airfield
         Management.

                                          Chapter 8

         NIGHT VISION DEVICE (NVD) VEHICLE GROUND OPERATIONS

8.1. General.
   8.1.1. The Christmas Tree Apron (south of Building 160) and Compass Rose (west of
   Taxiway Alpha). are the only authorized NVD Vehicle Ground Operation areas on the Little
   Rock AFB airfield. The use of the Christmas Tree Apron must be coordinated/de-conflicted
   with 34 CTS (JRTC) and Airfield Management.
   8.1.2. The 19 OG/CC is the approving authority to conduct NVD vehicle ground operations
   at any other location on the Little Rock AFB airfield. At a minimum, all requests must be
   coordinated with 19 OSS/OSA, 19 OSS/OSO, 19 OSS/OST, 19 CES/CEF, 19 SFS/SFO, 19
   LRS/LGRA, 19 WG/SE, and 19 WG/CPM. Note: Although not considered part of the
   airfield, units conducting NVD ground training at both the C-130E and C-130J Fuselage
   Trainers (FuT, located between Hangar 250 and Building 253) must comply with all NVD
   ground safety requirements listed below. The government site level PO/QAR will coordinate
   turning off adjacent facility lighting. No C-130 ballpark lights will be turned off.
   8.1.3. For NVD ground operations training, all vehicle ground operations within 50 feet of
   an aircraft or FuT are considered “loading operations.” This definition only applies to
   vehicles under direct control of a NVD qualified load team consisting of a marshaller, safety
   observer, and spotters.
   8.1.4. The unit conducting NVD operations is responsible for manually turning on/off the
   Christmas Tree Apron lighting. The on/off switches are located west of stub 1 in the
   Christmas Tree area. The Compass Rose does not have lighting.
   8.1.5. Nonparticipating vehicles will not mix with participating NVD vehicles.
   Additionally, the number of NVD vehicles must be kept to the absolute minimum necessary
   to accomplish required operations/training.
   8.1.6. Operators will ensure the vehicle is prepared for NVD operations. Items to consider
   include, but are not limited to: Vehicle is FOD-free, serviceable, and clean; turning off or
   covering interior and exterior lights, using compatible chemical light sticks, etc.
   8.1.7. Any individual noticing an unsafe or potentially unsafe situation will stop all NVD
   operations immediately by calling, "STOP" and utilizing appropriate hand signals. If NVD
   ground participants cannot hear "STOP" or see the "STOP" operations hand signal, then
   existing on-NVD communication safety procedures (flash lights, radios, ground comm cords,
   etc.) will be used. NVD operations will not resume until the unsafe situation is rectified.
   8.1.8. NVDs are considered equipment and are not vehicle-specific; however, all airfield
   drivers must possess a valid Government Driver’s License (AF Form 2293) indicating the
   types of vehicles on which they have been trained and certified. If gross vehicle weight is
   less than 10,000 pounds (4x2), 11 passengers or less, then licensee does not require an AF
   Form 2293.
LITTLEROCKAFBI13-213 9 JANUARY 2014                                                           41


   8.1.9. Vehicles operating with lights-out during periods of reduced lighting must use hazard
   warning flashers or mount an IR strobe on the vehicle’s roof so aircrew can observe the
   vehicle on the airfield.
8.2. NVD Speed Limits.
   8.2.1. Vehicle operators driving within 50 feet of an aircraft are restricted to 3 MPH
   (maximum).
   8.2.2. All other vehicle operators are limited to 10 MPH (maximum).
8.3. Driver and Assistant Driver Responsibilities.
   8.3.1. Prior to any NVD ground operations, drivers and assistant drivers will institute formal
   procedures for assessing and mitigating risks in each on-load/off-load operation between the
   aircrew and load team members. Drivers will address the experience of the load team and
   aircrew members involved in the procedure. As a minimum, personnel in training should be
   identified to all members of the operation so appropriate risk decisions can be made.
   8.3.2. All vehicles conducting NVD qualification/refresher training are required to have an
   assistant NVD driver.
   8.3.3. Drivers and assistant drivers must be trained and certified by a unit-qualified NVD
   instructor. Note: All NVD training must be documented in the member’s training record, on
   an AF Form 1098, or unit automated system.
   8.3.4. Drivers will inspect NVD equipment prior to use.
   8.3.5. Drivers will obtain current weather forecasts prior to NVD operations. Minimum
   visibility requirement for NVD ground operations is 500 feet. The 19 OG/CC is the approval
   authority for NVD Ground Operations under 500 feet visibility. Note: The effectiveness of
   NVDs is greatly reduced in conditions of rain, haze, fog, snow, and smoke. NVDs also have
   a limited ability to detect inclement/obscured weather. NVD users must be aware of these
   conditions before entering an area of reduced visibility.
   8.3.6. Drivers will ensure support personnel and safety observer(s) are in place prior to NVD
   operations.
   8.3.7. Focus NVDs as described in appropriate regulation/T.O.
   8.3.8. All NVD driving operations will be conducted with the NVD secured in the head
   harness or mounted on a helmet and worn on the driver’s head.
   8.3.9. Driver/assistant driver communication.
       8.3.9.1. Assistant drivers with NVDs can assist the driver by compensating for lack of
       peripheral vision. They must keep the driver informed of any obstacles in or outside their
       field of view. Communication is a must! Drivers, on the other hand, must keep assistant
       drivers informed of any deterioration in vision caused by weather, eye fatigue, or NVD
       malfunction.
       8.3.9.2. The driver must focus their goggles for distance vision even though this makes
       instrument reading difficult. The assistant driver can compensate for this by alternating
       between distance and close-up viewing and keeping the driver informed of any critical
       instrument lights that may turn on. Depending on vehicle configuration, the assistant

      driver may need to sit directly behind the driver to gain a better view of the instrument
      panel.
   8.3.10. If the driver loses situational awareness, they will stop the vehicle immediately. If
   there are no aircraft moving in the area, the vehicle will remain stationary until the driver has
   regained situational awareness.
8.4. NVD-related Accident Reporting Procedures.
   8.4.1. Individuals involved in a NVD-related accident will immediately stop all NVD
   operations and comply with paragraph 3.17. of this instruction.
8.5. Airfield Driving/NVD Licensing Procedures.
   8.5.1. Airfield drivers requesting to utilize NVDs on Little Rock AFB airfield (includes the
   Christmas Tree Apron and Compass Rose) must bring documentation (copy of AF Form
   1098 will suffice) indicating successful completion of NVD training to 19 OSS/OSAA.
   After review of documentation, Airfield Management will add "NVD Qualified" on the AF
   IMT 483, Certificate of Competency.
   8.5.2. The NVD training documentation will be given to the unit ADPM for filing with the
   member’s other airfield driving paperwork.
8.6. Annual Qualification/Refresher Training Requirements.
   8.6.1. NVD operations currency will last one AEF cycle from the last documented NVD
   event.
   8.6.2. All personnel required for NVD operations must complete the AMC-approved
   recurring NVD training course every two AEF cycles, regardless of when the last NVD event
   was accomplished.
   8.6.3. The unit NVD Instructor and/or unit training representative will be responsible for all
   annual qualification/refresher training requirements.
   8.6.4. The unit NVD Instructor or training representative will document annual qualification
   and refresher training in each member’s training record on the AF Form 1098.
8.7. NVD Instructor Qualification Requirements.
   8.7.1. Must be trained and certified to drive on the Little Rock AFB airfield.
   8.7.2. Must possess a valid government driver’s license indicating the types of vehicles on
   which they have been trained and certified.

              CONTROLLED MOVEMENT AREA (CMA) PHRASEOLOGY

A6.1. Techniques and Instructions Used on the Airfield:
   A6.1.1. When requesting access into the Controlled Movement Area, state the requested
   access point and include destination and expected duration.
   A6.1.2. Some runway crossing approvals may be issued as “without delay.” This means the
   control tower has approved your operation using minimal time on the runway. If you are
   crossing the runway, DO NOT STOP. If you expect to use more than minimal time on the
   runway or you are unable to proceed “without delay,” hold short and advise the control
   tower. If the controller approves you to cross the runway before you have made your request
   and you need access on the runway instead of crossing, hold short and advise the controller.
   A6.1.3. During inclement weather conditions (3 miles visibility and 1,500 foot ceiling, blue
   taxiway lights will be on), do not go past the Instrument Hold Lines (“INST”) or in the
   critical areas indicated on the airfield diagram without specific approval from the control
   tower. The CMA boundary marking is collocated with the “INST” marking/sign.
   A6.1.4. If on a runway or taxiway and you observe the runway lights going up/down in
   intensity or the taxiway lights flashing on and off, exit the area immediately and contact the
   control tower. You may be experiencing radio difficulties and cannot hear the instructions to
   exit the runway/taxiway.
   A6.1.5. Under no circumstances shall a vehicle be driven onto the runway if there is any
   uncertainty concerning the approval of the request.
   A6.1.6. Never use the phrases “CLEAR,” “CLEARED,” “CLEARING,” OR
   “CLEARANCE.” These words are used by air traffic control in communication only with
   aircraft.
A6.2. Example of initial call to the control tower: Normal communications to the control
tower will be initiated with Little Rock Tower, appropriate call sign (who is making the call),
present location (where caller is), and request (what caller wants to do).
“LITTLE ROCK TOWER, CONTRACTOR ONE ON TAXIWAY GOLF REQUEST
PERMISSION AROUND THE EAST END PERMITER ROAD.”

The controller will issue an approval/denial, hold instructions, or “stand by.”

“CONTRACTOR ONE, LITTLE ROCK TOWER, (action controller would like you to do).”
A6.3. Example of runway crossing:

VEHICLE: “LITTLE ROCK TOWER, AIRFIELD THREE.”

LITTLE ROCK TOWER: “AIRFIELD THREE, LITTLE ROCK TOWER.”

VEHICLE: “LITTLE ROCK TOWER, AIRFIELD THREE, I’M LOCATED ON TAXIWAY
 58                                             LITTLEROCKAFBI13-213 9 JANUARY 2014


FOXTROT AT INTERSECTION OF TAXIWAY DELTA, REQUEST PERMISSION TO
PROCEED ACROSS RUNWAY TWO FIVE.”

LITTLE ROCK TOWER WILL ADVISE THE VEHICLE TO: “HOLD SHORT FOR
ARRIVING OR DEPARTING AIRCRAFT” OR WILL TRANSMIT CROSSING
INSTRUCTIONS.

A6.4. Example of access onto the runway. Note: When contacting the control tower, you
must state your call sign, requested runway access point, destination (once on runway), and
expected duration on runway.
“SWEEPER ONE, REQUEST PERMISSION ON RUNWAY TWO FIVE AT TAXIWAY
ALPHA FOR APPROXIMATELY FIVE MINUTES.”
or
“AIRFIELD THREE, REQUEST ENTRY ONTO RUNWAY TWO FIVE AT TAXIWAY
CHARLIE, WILL EXIT RUNWAY AT TAXIWAY BRAVO.”

The controller will issue an approval or hold instructions.

“SWEEPER ONE, PROCEED ON RUNWAY TWO FIVE AT TAXIWAY ALPHA.”
or
“AIRFIELD THREE, PROCEED ONTO RUNWAY TWO FIVE AT TAXIWAY CHARLIE
TO TAXIWAY BRAVO.”

A6.5. Example of reporting off the runway:
“SWEEPER ONE IS OFF RUNWAY TWO FIVE AT TAXIWAY ALPHA.”

“AIRFIELD THREE OFF RUNWAY TWO FIVE AT TAXIWAY BRAVO.”

A6.6. Example of acknowledging tower instructions:

“LITTLE ROCK TOWER, AIRFIELD THREE PROCEEDING ONTO RUNWAY TWO FIVE
AT TAXIWAY CHARLIE AND WILL REPORT OFF AT TAXIWAY BRAVO.”

General:
Prior to work start, all contractors and subcontractors must receive and sign this briefing. A copy of this
briefing will be given to the individual(s). All contractors and subcontractors must check in with Airfield
Management Operations at the beginning and end of each day to receive/return a vehicle cone. Project
delivery vehicles (e.g. cement trucks, asphalt trucks, dump trucks, etc.) are exempt from these
requirements provided they are escorted by the contractor and travel to and from the work site via the
haul route assigned by Airfield Management.
Airfield Signs and Markings:

                   Restricted Area Marking - A six inch wide red line around the C-130 parking apron
used to delineate airfield restricted areas. Never enter these areas unless escorted by a authorized
individual.


                  Runway Holdline - Two solid yellow lines and two dashed yellow lines bordered in
black. These lines are located on each Taxiway (TWY) leading to the Runway. Never cross these lines
without control tower approval.


                    Instrument Holdline - Two parallel yellow lines with multiple pairs of double vertical
yellow stripes. The letters "INST" are co-located with this holdline. These lines are located on Taxiways
F & G and are used to identify/protect the runway instrument landing systems. Never cross these lines
without control tower approval. CMA markings are co-located with the “INST” marking/sign.


       25          Hold Position Sign - Red background and white numbers (i.e. "7", "25", "7-25", "25-
7"). These signs are located adjacent to all Runway Holdline markings. Never go past these signs

LITTLEROCKAFBI13-213 9 JANUARY 2014                                                                       65


FOD Control/Prevention:

1. Always ensure vehicle and tires are free of debris before entering the airfield area or leaving the
construction site.

2. Always ensure the work site is clean and all equipment and materials are secure.

3. Crossing Taxiways: If the contractor posts a FOD monitor at taxiway crossings, the monitor will
check the taxiway after each vehicle crosses. If no monitor is posted, the drivers of each vehicle must
stop and visually inspect the taxiway after each crossing.
Controlled Movement Area Procedures (Runway Incursion Prevention):

1. Controlled Movement Area (CMA): Areas on the airfield where direct two-way radio contact with the
control tower is required. Do not enter the CMA without prior coordination with Airfield Management
and approval from control tower. The following locations are part of the CMA: Runway (including
overruns), Assault Zone (including TWYs H and J), TWYs A - E, all grassy areas north of TWY F
(except fuel/NAVAID facilities outlined below in Para. 3), and the eastern portion of TWY F beginning at
the CMA boundary marking. Additional areas include TWY G from E to the entrance of the Christmas
Tree Apron. The CMA continues west, north, and east from these areas to the tree line around the
airfield.

2. If approved to work in the CMA, always maintain two-way radio contact with the control tower.
Repeat clearance request back to the control tower. Example: Contact the control tower, give your call
sign, request, and location; “TOWER CONTRACTOR ONE, REQUEST ENTRY ONTO TAXIWAY
BRAVO FROM TAXIWAY FOXTROT.” Tower will approve or disapprove your request based on other
traffic, using the following phraseology. “CONTRACTOR ONE TOWER, PROCEED ONTO
TAXIWAY BRAVO VIA TAXIWAY FOXTROT,” or “CONTRACTOR ONE TOWER, HOLD SHORT
ACFT TAXIING.” The driver will repeat the instructions back to the control tower and comply
accordingly. Advise the control tower as soon as your vehicle is out of the CMA. “TOWER,
CONTRACTOR ONE IS OFF TAXIWAY BRAVO.” Do not use the word “clear” or any word that
contains “clear.”

3. Any personnel requiring access inside the CMA when the airfield is closed must coordinate with
Security Forces Control Center (SFCC)/Law Enforcement Desk (LED) (987-3221) prior to entering and
leaving the CMA. Individual will provide name, rank, organization, contact information, radio call sign,
description of vehicle, location and reason for airfield access. SFS will verify individual against
authorization letter on file. If individual is not listed, CMA access will be denied.

Vehicle Control Area:

Vehicle Control Area (VCA): Vehicles operating in this area are not required to have contact with the
control tower; however, they must coordinate with Airfield Management for approval. The following
locations are part of the VCA: The grassy areas south of TWY F, east and west of the parking apron,
including the Christmas Tree, to the tree line around the airfield. Additional areas include all fuel pump
houses/maintenance facilities with direct access from non-CMA portions of TWY F.
CMA Light Gun Signals:

1. Light Gun signals are used by the Tower to control vehicle traffic within the CMA during vehicle/
Tower communication failures. AFVA 11-240 (see Attachment 13) and AFVA 13-222 will be
issued/displayed in vehicle.




2. In the event vehicles within the CMA do not respond to light gun signals, the control tower will raise
and lower the intensity of the runway edge lights or turn the edge lights on and off. This signal means to
immediately exit the CMA and establish communications with Tower.
Airfield Violations and Consequences:

1. Contractors, sub-contractors, and their workers will obey all airfield rules and regulations at all times.

2. Airfield Management (AM) is the Point of Contact for Airfield Operations. Never assume anything; if
in doubt, contact AM at (501) 987-6123 for assistance.
LITTLEROCKAFBI13-213 9 JANUARY 2014                                                                        67


3. Repeat or serious offenders can and will be asked to leave the airfield (at contractor’s expense). If this
should become necessary, the CE/QA and Contract Administrator will be notified immediately.

4. The Airfield Manager or designated representative will visit the work site/haul route on a daily basis.
