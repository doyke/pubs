This instruction establishes responsibilities and guidelines for all operational 463L Air Cargo
Pallets and Air Cargo Pallet Net assets inspection, disposition, accountability and storage. Each
unit pallet and net monitor within the 366th Fighter Wing (366 FW) will comply with this
instruction. These assets are critical components of the airlift portion of the Defense
Transportation System. Inspection and accountability of such assets require strict management.
During contingency situations, their availability at the right place and time can be the
determining factor in mission success or failure. Ensure all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force
Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of IAW Air Force Records

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Local repair procedures and responsibility for the 366th Equipment Maintenance Squadron (366
EMS) and the 366th Logistics Readiness Squadron (366 LRS) have been deleted due to the
capabilities no longer being available at Mountain Home AFB. Additionally, office symbols and
names have been changed to align with reorganization of LRS.
1. 366th Logistics Readiness Squadron (366 LRS) Responsibilities:
2                                             MOUNTAINHOMEAFBI24-303 10 MAY 2010


    1.1. 366 LRS/LGRDAS (Deployment and Distribution Flight), the Installation Pallet and
    Net Monitor (IPNM) will ensure these procedures are followed by all 366 FW Unit Pallet
    and Net Monitors (UPNM).
    1.2. Submit monthly report via 463L Global Asset Reporting Tool no later than (NLT) the
    8th of each month by entering the number of 463L assets on hand or in-use by Mountain
    Home AFB.
2. UPNM/Users:
    2.1. UPNM will control, maintain and report pallets and nets IAW this instruction,
    Department of Defense Regulation (DODR) 4500-9, Defense Transportation Regulation, and
    referenced Technical Order (TO).
    2.2. UPNMs will provide IPNM with an appointment letter for all pallet and net monitors
    annually IAW DODR 4500-9, Part VI, Appendix G, Paragraph A.2. (i.e., 1 January), or as
    changes occur (Attachment 2, Pallet and Net Appointment Letter).
    2.3. UPNM/Users Inspection Procedures:
       2.3.1. Each unit pallet and net monitor will spot check their 463L pallets and nets
       monthly to ensure they are being properly maintained, stored, and accounted for. During
       inspection, check pallets for signs of corrosion, warpage, delamination, damaged rails,
       and loose or missing hardware. Remove corrosion with wire brush or other suitable
       means that does not damage pallet. References for inspection of 463L pallets are in TO
       35D33-2-2-2, 463L Air Cargo Pallets HCU-6/E, HCU-12/E, paragraph 2.5.
       2.3.2. Provide a monthly status report to the IPNM NLT the last duty day of each month
       using the Monthly 8701 Report for Pallets and Nets (Attachment 3, Operational 463L
       Pallet and Nets Monthly Report).
       2.3.3. Units will use the Custodial Logs for Pallets and Nets whenever there is a loss
       and/or gain of assets (i.e., deployments, redistribution, exercises, etc.)(Attachment 4,
       Pallet Control Log, and Attachment 5, Nets Control Log).
       2.3.4. Physically inspect all 463L air cargo nets before using or storing. To inspect nets,
       lay out each net and check for dry rot, tears, bad stitching and missing or damaged parts.
       References for inspection of nets are in TO 35D33-2-3-1, Air Cargo Pallet Nets HCU-
       7/E, I, Side, HCU-15/C, II, Top, HCU-11/C, III Side, HCU-16/C, IV, Top.
       2.3.5. Divide inspected nets into one of the following categories and handle accordingly;
       serviceable, unserviceable and repairable, or condemned.
          2.3.5.1. Serviceable nets require no repairs. Immediately use or store nets in this
          category. Package stored nets on racks, in bins, or suitable boxes lined with water-
          vapor-proof barrier material (i.e., MIL-B-131), or polyethylene cargo pallet bag,
          National Stock Number 3990-00-930-1480, according to the quantity and size to be
          stored. Storage devices are unit funded.
          2.3.5.2. Unserviceable/repairable nets are nets that are in need of minor repair, (i.e.,
          torn webbing, missing hardware, etc.). Tag nets in this category with a DD Form
          1577-2, Unserviceable/Repairable Tag, near the damaged net area. If the net has
          several damaged locations, tag one place and flag all other locations with red tape.

          Ensure the remarks section of the attached DD Form 1577-2 is filled out in detail and
          clearly explains all required repairs. Box nets according to type, condition, and
          annotate number of nets in each container. Coordinate repair or disposition of
          unserviceable/repairable nets through IPNM.
          2.3.5.3. Condemned nets are nets that are extensively damaged or dry rotted. Tag
          condemned nets with a DD Form 1577. Coordinate disposition through IPNM.
      2.3.6. When pallets are stored outside, utilize a plastic barrier with each stack of 10 nets.
      Place barrier on top of the bottom dunnage to prevent moisture from penetrating through
      dunnage to the bottom surface of pallet. Afford proper sloping to palletized loads placed
      in this type of storage to allow for moisture drainage, by placing elevating material (scrap
      lumber, etc.) of the same size under one end of dunnage supporting the pallet. All
      subsequent stacks of 10 will have the barrier between dunnage and top of the tenth pallet.
      Note: Using plastic dunnage does not require additional plastic barriers. References for
      storage of pallets are in TO 35D33-2-2-2.
   2.4. Coordinate pallet repair or a one-for-one exchange with IPNM. Units are responsible
   for making transportation arrangements to pick up or drop off pallets to the IPNM. IPNM is
   not responsible for pickup or delivery.
