                             COMBAT CONTROL
                 CAREER FIELD EDUCATION AND TRAINING PLAN


This change is effective immediately and updates 1C2X1 CFETP dated Nov 06 and change 1
dated Feb 08 and change 2 dated Aug 09. Compliance with AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training
Program, and other training publications and documents is required.

   1. Write in changes:

          a. Page 12 paragraph 6 to read: “Training Decisions. The CFETP uses a building
             block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training
             requirements for the Combat Control specialty. The spectrum includes a strategy
             for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements. The strategy must be
             apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed
             approach to training. The following training decisions were based on a career field
             Utilization & Training Workshop (U&TW) held at Lackland AFB, TX from 19-22
             June 2012. Key training decisions from the U&TW involved adding specific line
             items for landing zone establishment and landing zone safety officer duties, stress
             inoculation and resiliency training. It identifies more stringent fitness progression
             requirements and developmental water skills training for the apprentice training
             pipeline. The 1C1X1 apprentice course will now include tower and radar for all
             trainees. The CFM is the authority for waiving any mandatory training
             requirement(s). Process waiver requests to the CFM as described in AFI 36-2201,
             Volume 5.”

          b. Page 12 paragraph 6.1 to read: “Apprentice Training. The apprentice-training
             pipeline was adjusted to address training deficiencies. Specifically, progressive
             rucksack training standards were reduced and standardized to better prepare
             trainees for follow-on courses in the pipeline. Fitness standards were adjusted to
             provide a science-based progression from the adjusted PAST standards, effective 1
             June 2011, and development water skills were incorporated to ensure trainees are
             prepared for ASTC mandatory requirements. Additionally major changes to the
             Combat Control Operator Course (ATC Course) were incorporated adding radar to
             the curriculum. These changes were driven completely by the 1C1X1 career field.
             In the most expeditious manner, the Combat Control Apprentice pipeline provides:
                                                                                                 1
                Screening to prepare Combat Control trainees physically and mentally for the
                rigors of the training pipeline; Air Traffic Control Training (Combat Control
                Operator Courses); Basic jump training (Army Airborne); water survival;
                helicopter dunker training; and Combat Survival Training. These qualification
                courses are mandatory prerequisites for entry into the AFSC awarding course. The
                Combat Control Apprentice course provides individuals with knowledge and
                hands-on training that prepares them for ASTC with apprentice 3-skill level skill
                sets.”

              c. Page 12 paragraph 6.1.1. to read: “Apprentice Physical Training. Physical
                 conditioning is a cornerstone of combat effectiveness. The Combat Control
                 pipeline emphasizes physical training to assure that apprentice course graduates
                 have the strength and endurance to meet the intense physical challenges inherent in
                 the 5- level upgrade process and the CCT specialty. Efficient training of Combat
                 Controllers from course of initial entry (COIE) through Apprentice (3-skill level)
                 and Journeyman (5-skill level) is a complex, multi-command effort. The standards
                 described in table 6.1 and table 6.2 support STS tasks 1.3.4. Physical Training,
                 1.3.5 Perform surface swimming and 1.3.6 Perform progressive surface/subsurface
                 water skills training as these tasks apply to the apprentice pipeline. Events will be
                 administered in the sequence and manner specified for PAST test procedures
                 published in training advisories or AFI 36-2626.”

      Note: Developmental water skills training establishes a progressive water skills familiarization
      and development plan to build trainee skills in mandatory tasks for 5-level progression. The
      training is a developmental target, not a graded criterion for the apprentice pipeline. Student
      participation is mandatory.
