                                                                            (Col Daniel A. Kosin)

  This Inspection Checklist implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 90-2, Inspector
  General --The Inspection System, 26 April 2006, Air Force Instruction (AFI) 90-201, Inspector
  General Activities, 17 June 2009, and AFI 90-201_AFGSCSUP, Addendum J, Unit Compliance
  Inspections, 1 February 2010. This checklist reflects command requirements for Operations
  Stan/Eval Programs for AFGSC missile operators at all levels to prepare for and conduct internal
  reviews, staff assistance visits (SAV), nuclear surety inspections (NSI), operational readiness
  inspections (ORI) and compliance inspections (CI). It complements instructions governing crew
  operations (Air Force Instruction (AFI) 10-1201, Space Operations, Air Force Global Strike
  Command Instruction (AFGSCI) 10-1202, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Crew
  Operations, and AFGSCI 36-2202V1, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Mission-Ready Training,
  Evaluation and Standardization Programs) and implements the guidance found in AFI 90-201,
  Inspector General Activities, and the AFGSC supplement to it. Effective unit self-inspections
  serve as the foundation for commanders to ensure compliance with governing directives. This
  checklist applies to Headquarters (HQ) Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), Twentieth
  Air Force (20 AF), and the Missile Wings. This checklist does not apply to Air National Guard
  units or Air Force Reserve Command.
  Ensure that all records created as a result of the processes prescribed in this publication are
  maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records,
  and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Information Management System
  (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This interim change implements new guidelines that clarify the AFGSC Inspector General
Inspection Checklist requirements, corrects the short title to reflect the 90 series numbering.
1. This publication establishes a baseline checklist. The checklist will also be used by the
Command IG during applicable assessments. References have been provided for each item.
Critical items have been kept to a minimum, and are related to public law, safety, security, fiscal
responsibility, and/or mission accomplishment. Critical items require direct IG evaluation per
AFI 90-201, and are those items that if not accomplished in support of primary mission could
result in an overall MAJCOM/NAF/Wing assessment rating of less than satisfactory. Attention
to non-critical items helps gauge the effectiveness and efficiency of the unit.
2. AFGSC checklists will not be supplemented. Units produce their own stand-alone checklists
as needed to ensure an effective and thorough review of the unit program. Refer recommended
changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)
using AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the
field through the appropriate functional’s chain of command. See Attachment 1, Table A1.1.
3. Adopted Forms:
3.1. AFGSC Form 91, Individual’s Record of Duties and Qualification
3.2. AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication
