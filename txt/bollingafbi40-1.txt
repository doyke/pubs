       3.2.4.1. FAST services are secondary prevention counseling services designed to provide psy-
       chosocial assessments and therapeutic interventions to families at risk for maltreatment where
       there is no open maltreatment record and the family is not eligible for New Parent Support
       Program.
       3.2.4.2. The FATM or the FAO may provide FAST services to active duty members and fam-
       ilies only when the following conditions are met:
       - The New Parent Support Program (NPSP) is fully supported by Treatment Managers, and
       after managing all maltreatment client services and all social work needs of NPSP clients, the
       FAO and/or FATM has space available to provide FAST services.
       - FAST clients must be eligible beneficiaries, with priority to active duty members and their
       families.
       - The family does not have an open maltreatment record and is not eligible for NPSP.

         - As a result of a FAST services psychosocial assessment, the family is considered to be at risk
         for family maltreatment.
         3.2.4.3. Referrals for FAST services may come from unit leadership, medical providers and
         personnel from other agencies or self-referral.
         3.2.4.4. FAST services are voluntary. FAP staff will NOT encourage Commanders to direct
         clients to participate.
  3.3. Guidance for Special Needs Identification
     3.3.1. Purpose. The purpose of identifying family members with special needs is to identify the
     availability of medical and educational services required for family members prior to reassign-
     ment.
         3.3.1.1. Special Need: A medical, psychological, or educational condition of a chronic nature,
         which requires the active management by a medical sub-specialty, or special education person-
         nel.
     3.3.2. The Special Needs Coordinator (SNC) is the action officer for Special Needs Identification
     and Assignment Coordination and is responsible for oversight of all functions and will serve as a
     member of the FAC.
     3.3.3. If command information is known, the SNC must inform the gaining command section
     about the special needs with “high risk of harm to oneself or others” probability of incoming
     active duty member or his/her family member prior to expected date of arrival of said active duty
     member.
     3.3.4. Procedures.
         3.3.4.1. When a special need is identified in an active duty Air Force family member, the SNC
         will provide assistance to the sponsor and family in the special needs identification and assign-
         ment coordination process.
         3.3.4.2. The SNC will assist family members in conducting:
         - Assessments for “Q-code” identification.
         - Family Member Relocation Clearances (FMRC) on AF Form 1466, Request for Family
         Members and Education Clearance for Travel and DD Form 2792, Exceptional Family Mem-
         ber Medical & Educational Summary.
