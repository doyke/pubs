This Fairchild Air Force Base Instruction (FAFBI) establishes procedures for maintaining a Liquid Oxy-
gen (LOX) contract annually. This operating instruction is not applicable to Air National Guard and
United States (US) Air Force Reserve units. Ensure all records created as a result of processes prescribed
in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 37-123, Management
of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Information Management System
(AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/rds/index.cfm.


1. Responsibilities: Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) and Maintenance Squadron (MXS) Com-
manders and shop supervisors will ensure adherence to procedures in this FAFBI.

2. Procedures: The primary goal for using the LOX procedures contained in this instruction is to elimi-
nate the maintenance and costs associated with maintaining liquid oxygen storage tanks. This process will
allow us to maintain a contract with a civilian supplier to meet War Consumable Distribution Objective
(WCDO) and 92d Air Refueling Wing (92 ARW) transient aircraft requirements (Attachment 3).
   2.1. The 92 MXS Resource Advisor will initiate an Air Force (AF) Information Management Tool
   (IMT) 9, Request for Purchase, for fiscal year LOX requirements. The fund site will be provided by
   the 92 MXS Resource Advisor; this amount will not be less than $1,000.00. The owning base nor-
   mally funds transient support for their respective aircraft. The AF IMT 9 will be forwarded to 92d
   Contracting Squadron (92 CONS) for the award of a not-to-exceed contract. 92 LRS fuels personnel
   (LGRF) will hand deliver (or fax) a copy of each invoice to the (92 MXS/CCIR) 92d Maintenance
   Squadron Resource Advisor and 92 CONS the next duty day after carts are serviced.
NOTE: A list of Fuels Management Flight personnel authorized to deliver carts will be part of the annual
contract furnished to the contractor. 92 CONS personnel will be notified in writing of any changes and
they will notify the contractor of changes.

    2.2. 92 LRS Commander (92 LRS/CC) will courtesy copy 92 LRS Procedures and Accountability (92
    LRS/LGRSP) the memorandum (Attachment 2) to maintain the WCDO level on contract.
    2.3. 92 MXS Electro Environmental Shop is responsible for the maintenance of three 50-gallon LOX
    carts in serviceable standby status (ready to receive product). Electro Environmental is located
    between Hangar Three and Hangar Four.
    2.4. When LOX is required, the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) or 92 LRS Contingency C2,
    Planning and Training (92 LRS/LGRRP) will contact the 92 LRS Resource Control Center, Fuels
    Management Flight as far in advance as possible.
    2.5. Fuels Management Flight personnel will call the contractor to inform them of the requirement to
    have the carts serviced and will deliver the required carts to the contractor.
    2.6. Prior to traveling to the civilian contractor (Inland Welding Supply A-L Compressed Gases) fuels
    personnel will contact the government quality assurance representative (QAR) to coordinate odor and
    particulate samples. Government QAR per Technical Order (T.O.) 42B6-1-1 paragraph 3-13 will
    ensure the LOX generating plant meets the requirements of MIL-PRF-27210. During the LOX cart
    filling operation, the QAR will provide a Department of Defense (DoD) Form 250, Material Receiv-
    ing and Inspection Report with his/her signature as evidence the contractor complied with T.O.
    42B6-1-1.

3. Transportation of LOX carts to the contractor:
    3.1. Fuels Management Flight personnel will coordinate transportation requests through 92 LRS
    Vehicle Operation Flight (92 LRS/LGRO). A 1.5 ton (minimum) flatbed pickup with extending
    tommy lift will be required for transportation of one to two 50-gallon carts. Fuels Management Flight
    personnel will obtain requested vehicle from 92 LRS Vehicle Dispatch and deliver the carts to the
    local contractor. Fuels Management Flight personnel will go to the contractor facility to oversee the
    filling process.
NOTE: Air Force personnel possessing a valid civilian driver’s license are authorized to operate/drive a
1.5 ton vehicle.
    3.2. For emergency situations, contact 92 LRS Vehicle Dispatch to request a 1.5 ton flatbed.
    3.3. Fuels Management Flight personnel will ensure all shipping documents and placards are in place
    when transporting LOX carts (reference Attachment 4).
    3.4. After the carts are filled, returned to base and unloaded, Fuels Management Flight will contact
    the MOC to have the carts picked up.

          SOLE SOURCE LOCAL PURCHASE FOR WCDO LOX REQUIREMENT


MEMORANDUM FOR 92 CONS/LGCS
FROM: 92 LRS/CC
SUBJECT: Sole Source Local Purchase for War Consumable Distribution Objective (WCDO) Liquid
Oxygen (LOX) Requirement


1. The Fuels Management Flight of the 92 LRS has determined that it is more cost effective to purchase
liquid oxygen (LOX) from a local source on an as needed basis in order to support our War Consumable
Distribution Objectives (WCDO).
2. The Fuels Management Flight has selected Inland Welding Supply A - L Compressed Gases, 4230 E.
Trent, Spokane, WA to provide LOX support because they have the necessary support equipment and
filters. A - L Compressed Gases is the only liquid oxygen supplier in Spokane with the approved filters
to meet government quality assurance specifications. Phone 534-1595, sales rep Steve Balmes,
1-800-852-4979.
3. Refer any questions or concerns to 92 LRS Bulk Storage Section NCOIC or Mr. Danny Kiter at
