This Airlift Wing instruction implements Air Force Instruction (AFI) 63-1001, Aircraft
Structural Integrity Program and extends guidance of AFI 21-101_AFRCSUP1, Aerospace
Equipment Maintenance Management. It applies to all 94th Airlift Wing (AW) personnel
involved in the maintenance and operation of aircraft. It defines the responsibilities and
procedures followed by appropriate organizations in implementing and sustaining the Aircraft
Structural Integrity Program (ASIP). This publication references MIL-STD-1530C, Aircraft
Structural Integrity Program, Technical Order, and (T.O.) 1C-130-101, Implementation of C-130
Series Aircraft Usage Report. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication
to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for
Change of Publication. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this
publication are maintained in accordance with the Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition
Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.                See
Attachment 1 for a glossary of references and supporting information.

1. General Information. The C-130 ASIP is managed by the C-130 System Program Office,
WRALC/LBRA. This office analyzes data provided by unit operations and maintenance
functions using a web-based program called USAF C-130 Automated Inspection, Repair,
Corrosion, and Aircraft Tracking (AIRCAT). Operations personnel input aircraft usage data
using the AIRCAT website or Remote Usage Data Input (RUDI) segment and aircraft
maintenance personnel utilize the Inspection Corrosion And Repair Recording (ICARR) segment
for documenting required ASIP inspections, aircraft structural repairs, and reports of damage to
aircraft structures. A major function of the AIRCAT system is to provide data to generate the
 2                                                               94AWI21-106 29 APRIL 2014

      3.4.1. ASM evaluates inspection findings to determine if the required repairs can be
      made at the unit level. ASM inputs data using the ICARR program only when a repair is
      accomplished. A detailed description of repair methods and pictures of the damage and
      repair shall be entered into ICARR within seven working days upon completion of the
      repair.
          3.4.1.1. In the event structural maintenance determines that the repair(s) is either not
          within the unit’s capabilities or there is insufficient technical data to effect the repair,
          structural maintenance will initiate a Maintenance Assistance Request IAW T.O. 00-
          25-107 and forward to QA for coordination and release.
      3.4.2. NDI is the focal point for entering inspection results into the ICARR MIS. All
