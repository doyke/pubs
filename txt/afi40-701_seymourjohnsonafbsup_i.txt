                                           Chapter 1

            PROCESS STRUCTURE AND ADMINISTRATIVE OVERVIEW

1.1. Special Needs Identification and Assignment Coordination (SNIAC) Process. The
mission of the Special Needs Identification and Assignment Coordination (SNIAC) process is to
identify medical and educational service requirements of family members in support of active
duty sponsor reassignment and civilian employment overseas. The SNIAC process proactively
identifies those family members who have special needs (as defined in paragraph 1.2.1.2) in
order to coordinate family relocations IAW with DoDI 1315.19, Authorizing Special Needs
Family Members Travel Overseas at Government Expense, December 20, 2005. DoDI 1315.19
implements federal laws protecting persons with disabilities. Air Force Exceptional Family
Member Program (EFMP) implements DoD policy by providing assignment considerations for
active duty sponsors where special medical and educational conditions of family members have
been identified. Enrollment in EFMP is mandatory for active duty members where family
member conditions are identified that meet enrollment criteria, as specified in DoDI 1315.19.
Assignment coordination activities for those family members with medical needs that do not
meet the DoD definition of special needs are also described in this instruction.
   1.1.1. The SNIAC process is a set of interrelated activities within the medical treatment
   facility and with multiple base and community agencies to support sponsors and their family
   members. The SNIAC process is not a ―program,‖ but relies on the coordination of
   information and integration of services that support sponsors, DoD employees, and family
   members. SNIAC functions directly support the EFMP through the application of medical
   information technology and the sharing of global resource information to ensure appropriate
   relocations of family members at government expense.
1.2. Process Components. The SNIAC process is composed of three principal components:
special needs identification, family member relocation clearance process, and research and
evaluation.
   1.2.1. Special Needs Identification. The purpose of identifying sponsors and their family
   members with special needs is to determine the ongoing necessary medical and educational
   services required for family members based on specific conditions, to support access to
   specialized services at the current and projected duty assignment, and to protect federal rights
   and entitlements for mobile family members. Early identification and documentation of
   special needs in family members of active duty sponsors streamline the assignment process
   when relocation is initiated. The coordinated identification of special needs assists with the
   continuity of family member care through the sponsor‘s Permanent Change of Station (PCS)
   and Temporary Duty (TDY). Civilian sponsors, AF Reservists, and Air National Guard
   members are not enrolled in EFMP but may be provided information by SNIAC upon
   request.
       1.2.1.1. Identification of special needs in family members of Department of Defense
       (DoD) civilians may not be considered in the hiring process. Once offered employment
       outside the continental United States (OCONUS), DoD civilians are required by DoDI
       1315.19 to disclose the existence of family member special needs to the hiring agent prior
6                             AFI40-701_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 19 APRIL 2011


       to initiating family member travel OCONUS at government expense. Decision-making
       about family travel resides with the civilian sponsor.
       1.2.1.2. DoDI 1315.19 defines ―special medical needs‖ and ―special educational needs‖
       as the needs of a family member who meets DoD criteria for identifying a family member
       with special needs, specified in Enclosure 4 of the DoD Instruction. The AF uses these
       definitions for all accompanied assignment actions, in the continental United States
       (CONUS) and OCONUS. DoDI 1315.19, Enclosure 4, establishes the criteria for
       mandatory EFMP enrollment for active duty members. Special needs in this context are
       typically of an enduring nature, likely to require specialized forms of medical/educational
       assistance regardless of the location of the family members. Family members who are
       identified with conditions that meet DoD criteria as special needs are registered in AF-
       sanctioned databases in order to expedite the consideration of service needs during
       relocation.
       1.2.1.3. In addition, needs for specialized services that do not meet EFMP enrollment
       criteria may be identified in the course of family member relocation processes in order to
       ensure appropriateness of family member travel to locations OCONUS under government
       sponsorship. The nature of these service needs may be shared with gaining treatment
       facilities in order to ensure appropriateness of family member travel OCONUS. These
       needs for services are typically temporary in nature or mild in severity, not meeting
       EFMP enrollment criteria as described in the DoDI. However, they are identified and
       evaluated prior to completion of the OCONUS Family Member Relocation Clearance
       process to ensure family member safety and the availability of needed care in overseas
       locations. OCONUS locations may recommend delay of travel or recommend against
       travel under command sponsorship where service needs exceed the capabilities of the
       military health system, regardless of EFMP enrollment status.
       1.2.1.4. Information about family members with service needs, as distinguished from the
       DoD definition of special needs, is not maintained in SNIAC databases any longer than
       needed to coordinate the requested relocation. The coordination documentation of travel
       recommendations on behalf of these family members may be retained for process
       accountability for time periods specified in para. 3.5.1.2 of this instruction.
    1.2.2. Family Member Relocation Clearances (FMRC). The SNIAC process implements
    Air Force responsibilities under Title 10, United States Code, for medical entitlements of
    military family members, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) to support
    access to special education services, the Joint Federal Travel Regulation for family member
    travel allowances and household goods shipment, and DoDI 1315.19. The goals of the
    SNIAC FMRC process are to prevent active duty assignment failures due to unavailable
    resources for family members, to support DoD civilians through the provision of information
    about services availability OCONUS, and to enhance access to medical and educational
    resources for all family members through the relocation process. These actions support
    mission readiness. Successful relocation reduces stress for sponsors, family members, and
    units. Coordinated relocation prevents the unnecessary loss of allocated fiscal resources and
    supports the equitable use of finite medical resources.
       1.2.2.1. DoD civilians are required by DoDI 1315.19 to disclose the presence of special
       needs of family members to the hiring agent prior to initiating family member travel
AFI40-701_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 19 APRIL 2011                                                  7


      OCONUS at government expense. These disclosures are used to advise civilian sponsors
      about availability of needed services. Decision-making about travel resides with the
      civilian sponsor. In no way will the SNIAC FMRC process affect offers of employment
      to DoD civilians.
          1.2.2.1.1. Civilian personnel agents working with selectees planning OCONUS travel
          inquire about the presence of special needs and refer DoD civilian sponsors to the
          military treatment facility (MTF) SNIAC office for information as needed.
      1.2.2.2. All relocation responsibilities for contract civilians, to include family member
      relocations and access to medical care, reside with the employing contractor and the
      employee.
      1.2.2.3. Active duty personnel who have family members with special needs that meet
      EFMP enrollment criteria will support family participation in the FMRC process prior to
      government-sponsored family travel to either CONUS or OCONUS locations.
      Additionally, all active duty sponsors will support the FMRC process used to screen
      family members for any service needs that may require additional relocation coordination
      prior to OCONUS relocation.
   1.2.3. Research and Evaluation: The SNIAC process supports system-wide research and
   evaluation of its process components. Research projects are conducted through collaborative
   partnerships with prominent researchers who understand the unique needs of military
   families. Projects are selected based on their potential to inform SNIAC‘s key processes,
   special needs identification and family member relocation. The AF-provided special needs
   data management information system maintains a database for management of the SNIAC
   process. Statistical reports are generated from data collected through AF data management
   systems to assess the impact of the process components and to support continuous process
   improvement. SNIAC partners with AFPC, with the AF Inspection Agency, and other
   monitoring entities to identify trends in service delivery in order to enhance the coordination
   of care for military families.
1.3. Additional Administrative Elements. To ensure process effectiveness, the following key
features will exist as part of each installation SNIAC process.
   1.3.1. A SNIAC Installation Directive for implementation of the SNIAC process. The
   Installation Commander has responsibility for the development, coordination, and
   publication of an installation instruction, which may integrate several topics outlining
   interagency support to families. The installation instruction will:
      1.3.1.1. Emphasize and coordinate the cross-functional processes of base agencies that
      identify and assist special needs family members, that specify the coordination of
      assignments for all active duty members requesting accompanied travel, that describe
      processes for the employment of DoD civilians who have dependent family members
      requesting overseas travel at government expense, and which promote access of sponsors
      and family members to community resources.
      1.3.1.2. Identify the Community Action Information Board (CAIB) and Integrated
      Delivery System (IDS) as groups which can identify the community issues related to the
      quality of life for family members with special needs. Using the expertise of their
8                             AFI40-701_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 19 APRIL 2011


       representatives, CAIB and IDS can provide workable solutions to specific issues and may
       be able to influence policy above the local level.
    1.3.1.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) The Special Needs Coordinator (SNC) will
    utilize command resources including the Integrated Delivery System (IDS) and Community
    Action Information Board (CAIB) to address any delivery of service or customer service
    issues not able to be resolved at a lower level.


    1.3.2. Memoranda of Understanding are completed between closely geographically located
    military installations‘ medical treatment facilities (Air Force or other Services) to delineate
    procedures for identifying special needs and for conducting EFMP or FMRC processes.
    Examples include methods for conducting the FMRC process:
       1.3.2.1. At remote locations,

        2.17.4.1.4. Ensures an available and qualified medical provider‘s ability to speak a
        language other than English is not a discriminating factor when recommending
        relocation to a CONUS installation. For special education needs, may confirm the
        presence or absence of English as a Second Language (ESL) services when providing
        travel recommendations. However, clearances into CONUS areas may not be denied
        based solely on educational conditions.
     2.17.4.2. In OCONUS MTFs, inbound FDIs may be received for all family members of
     active duty sponsors who have identified needs for specialized services, to include those
     with no prior qualifying EFMP-enrollment conditions. FDIs are forwarded for gaining
     base review for families of active duty members wherever specialized service needs are
     identified by the losing base SGH. FDIs are received OCONUS for DoD civilian
     sponsors requesting government-sponsored travel where special needs are identified and
     where DoD civilians have requested information about the gaining location. The
     gaining/reviewing SGH will:
        2.17.4.2.1. Ensure the sources of services reviewed for sufficiency, availability, and
        appropriateness to meet the needs are those in which the family is entitled to receive
        care upon arrival.

        of consideration of TRICARE Network resources in the local host nation when
        making travel recommendations for inbound active duty families.
        2.17.4.2.3. Where the adequacy of services for family members of civilian
        employees in the host nation is unknown or not verifiable, the SGH will ensure
        employees are informed of this prior to travel.
        2.17.4.2.4. In OCONUS areas, maintain advisement on enrollment in the TRICARE
        Overseas Program Prime and Global Remote overseas to support military families.

   skills in interviewing families for the purposes of identifying special needs and for
   coordinating needed care. The organizational location of the SNC is at the discretion of the
   MTF/CC.
   2.18.2. The SNC oversees and manages the installation SNIAC process IAW DoD and Air
   Force policy, and any subsequent implementing guidance. The SNC:
      2.18.2.1. Establishes and maintains procedures to identify sponsors whose family
      members have special medical and educational needs in a timely manner. Uses a multi-
      disciplinary and collaborative approach with other key service providers, such as
      installation youth and childcare facilities, and officer and enlisted spouses groups, to
      ensure effective outreach and identification of special needs.
          2.18.2.1.1. Ensures all active duty sponsors known to the MTF as having a special
          needs family member according to DoD criteria are identified to the AFPC (via the
          local MPF and/or CSS, where applicable) for issuance of assignment limitation code
          ―Q‖, regardless of the location of family members or the source of family health care.
          2.18.2.1.2. Ensures all Army and Navy active duty sponsors of family members with
          special needs are referred to their Services‘ EFMP points-of- contact for enrollment

     2.18.2.2. Provides training to medical staff, and consultation as needed to support the
     implementation of SNIAC base-wide.
        2.18.2.2.1. The SNC, with the SGH, ensures training and reference material is
        provided to the personnel listed in the following paragraphs within 90 days of
        trainee‘s assumption of responsibilities and on an ongoing basis as needed. Ensures
        annual refresher training or procedural reviews, at a minimum to:
            2.18.2.2.1.1. The alternate SNC(s), Medical Review Officer (MRO) and
            alternate(s), FMRC Coordinator and alternate(s), and other MTF staff with
            SNIAC duties, regarding DoD and AF policy and their assigned responsibilities.
            2.18.2.2.1.2. All MTF clinical personnel on the use of DoD criteria (DoDI
            1315.19, Enclosure 4) for identifying family members with special medical and
            educational needs, and SNIAC referral procedures. This training may be delivered
            as part of existing professional staff orientation and training forums.
        2.18.2.2.2. The SNC supports base-wide training on SNIAC and EFMP through the
        provision/review of training materials for unit commanders, their representatives, and
        training monitors. The SNC reviews training materials and references used by
        installation-level Civilian Personnel staff involved with screening family members of
        civilian employees for OCONUS travel upon request.
     2.18.2.3. Is integrally involved in the FMRC process. Follows procedures outlined in this
     instruction and refers to subsequent AF implementing guidance as needed. Ensures all
     FMRC requirements are implemented by all SNIAC staff. Works with supervisors/raters
     of other SNIAC staff as needed to correct noncompliance and to ensure appropriate
     interactions with family members.
        2.18.2.3.1. For outbound FDIs, the SNC participates with the MRO in jointly-
        scheduled interviews with all family members requesting government-authorized
        travel to accompany a sponsor in PCS (face-to-face interviews are required for
        families of active duty and recommended for families of DoD civilians). Exceptions
        may be made IAW para.s 2.18.2.3.1.4 and 3.4.3.4.1 of this instruction. Prior to the
        joint interview, the SNC reviews all medical records and MTF clinical data sources
        and summaries available, and plans the interview(s) with the MRO, ensuring options
        for private discussions with adult family members. Where face-to-face interviews are
        not possible due to extreme distances from any MTF, or due to the family member‘s
        inpatient/residential status or other serious medical condition, the SNC notes the
        exception in the FDI package to the gaining review authority.
            2.18.2.3.1.1. Conjoint interviews with families reduce the burden on customers
            by allowing ―one-stop‖ processing of their travel screenings. Where it is not
            feasible to offer conjoint interviews, the SNC ensures modifications to the
            conjoint interview procedure are detailed in local operating instructions that
            address how the needs of families are considered in the FMRC process.
            2.18.2.3.1.2. For families of active duty members, the SNC first ensures all
            family members are listed on either page 1 or page 2 of the AF form 1466 for
            OCONUS travel requests; ensures all family members with special needs are
            listed on either page 1 or page 2 of AF form 1466 for CONUS travel. The SNC
AFI40-701_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 19 APRIL 2011                                          27


          documents in the designated section on the AF Form 1466 the findings from
          record reviews and interviews with family members to support travel
          recommendations. Ensures any ―yes‖ items specifying needs for housing
          modifications, adaptive equipment, etc., are addressed in the designated sections
          of the DD Form 2792 for the specified family member.
          2.18.2.3.1.3. For DoD civilian families, interviews special needs family members
          upon request, and forwards information via DD Form 2792 and DD Form 2792-1
          with any cover summaries as appropriate. May use, but does not require, AF Form
          1466 for FDIs of DoD civilian families with special needs.
          2.18.2.3.1.4. If the family members are geographically separated from the MTF
          supporting the FMRC, they may be seen by a civilian provider or a provider at a
          sister Service MTF. The provider(s) or MTF(s) with the most recent information
          available about family care needs provides the needed information to support the
          review. The family member(s) provide written consent to their medical
          provider(s) to release information to the SNIAC staff for the purpose of
          coordinating care through relocation. In these cases the SNC and MRO
          collaborate to communicate with the provider interviewing family members to
          ensure understanding of the purpose of such screening, the limitations of service
          availability in many locations, and the documentation needed to support the
          gaining installation in making travel recommendations. When it is necessary to
          involve a civilian provider in completing DD Forms 2792, the MRO and SGH at
          the sponsor‘s base retain responsibility for completion of the AF Form 1466 for
          families of active duty members. MTFs of any Service branch that are located
          near geographically separated family members may provide input to the AF Form
          1466 as supporting bases. See para. 3.4.3. A cover memo may be sent in the FDI
          in lieu of AF Form 1466 for families of DoD civilians.
          2.18.2.3.1.5. The SNC, with the SGH, ensures outbound documentation that
          supports the FMRC is processed in an expeditious manner toward timely
          assignment recommendations. Intervenes/elevates through the medical chain of
          command as needed where delays potentially impact timely assignments or
          employments of sponsors.
       2.18.2.3.2. For inbound FDIs (active duty and civilian sponsors), the SNC works
       with the FMRC Coordinator and the SGH to ensure all medical and educational
       authorities that might be involved in the care of identified needs are consulted for
       service availability. Supports the SGH in providing written responses that either
       recommend or do not recommend travel for families of active duty members, or that
       outline potential limitations of services for families of civilian sponsors. Where
       necessary housing modifications are identified in the FDI package, ensures the base
       housing office is advised of the anticipated modification(s) during the 14-day
       relocation review period. Includes accessibility information provided by the housing
       office, where applicable, in the response to the losing installation.
       2.18.2.3.3. With the FMRC Coordinator, the SNC ensures all FDIs are appropriately
       logged and tracked during the review process. Ensures the inbound FDI process is
       completed within 14-calendar days from submission of a completed package to
28                        AFI40-701_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 19 APRIL 2011


        response from the gaining installation. If a response is not possible within this
        timeframe, ensures the losing FRMC Coordinator is notified of the reasons for delay
        and intervenes as needed to expedite response.
        2.18.2.3.4. With the FMRC Coordinator, the losing installation‘s SNC ensures all
        considerations about potential limitations, types of housing modifications possible,
        etc., that are submitted by the gaining installation via FDI response are provided to
        the sponsor and/or adult family member(s) upon receipt.
        2.18.2.3.5. With the FMRC Coordinator, ensures sponsors receiving an initial
        recommendation against OCONUS family member travel are advised of the pinpoint
        process and of further MAJCOM consideration of OCONUS travel options.
     2.18.2.4. Complies with requirements for data security, maintenance, collection, and
     reporting IAW AFPD 40-7 and any subsequent AFMOA, MAJCOM, or MTF
     implementing guidance. The SNC:
        2.18.2.4.1. Maintains responsibility for base-level data entry in AF-provided data
        management systems used in the management of SNIAC. Ensures all family members
        of active duty personnel that have been identified as having special needs according
        to the DoD criteria are entered into the database, with the number of special needs
        family members identified reported upon request to AFMOA/SGHW. Tracks FDIs
        involving active duty personnel and DoD civilians using tracking mechanisms

        2.18.2.5.1. Ensures every AF sponsor with one or more family members with special
        needs that is assigned to the installation has a SNAC file maintained at the MTF.
        2.18.2.5.2. Ensures a case entry is established/updated in the AF electronic data
        management system indicating the sponsor‘s current duty location. The SNC ensures
        the location and identifying information (such as Social Security Numbers and special
        medical/educational conditions) of all family members is accurate in both SNAC file
        and the electronic data management system.
     2.18.2.6. Participates in the MTF quality assurance program for SNIAC.
        2.18.2.6.1. The SNC performs periodic self-assessments using MTF Operating
        Instructions, installation instructions, AFIA or other monitoring agency inspection
        criteria, AFMOA implementing guidance, and AF and DoD policy.
        2.18.2.6.2. The SNC, under the direction of the MTF/CC and SGH, tracks indicators

          2.20.1.5.1. The performance of a physical exam is not expected by the MRO for
          traveling family members, however the MRO will physically see all family members
          of active duty sponsors requesting government sponsored travel to make general
          observations of evident conditions or needs that need documentation in the FMRC
          process. Face-to-face interviews support the opportunity to discuss sensitive topics
          with adult family members that may not be evident in medical records or known to
          the sponsor. Permissible exceptions to face-to-face interviews are noted in para.s

          offered a private interview to discuss health histories, diagnoses, treatments and
          prognoses.
          2.20.1.5.4. If the family members are geographically separated from the MTF
          supporting the FMRC, they may be seen by a civilian provider or a provider at a sister
          Service MTF. The family member(s) provide written consent to all medical
          provider(s) involved to release information to the SNIAC staff for the purpose of
          coordinating care through relocation. In these cases the MRO communicates with the
          provider interviewing family members to ensure understanding of the purpose of such
          screening, the limitations of service availability in many locations, and the
          documentation needed to support the gaining installation in making travel
          recommendations. See para. 3.4.3. When it is necessary to involve a civilian provider

                                         Chapter 3

                    OPERATING PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS

3.1. Identification of Special Needs in Family Members of Active Duty Sponsors.
   3.1.1. Upon Sponsor Inprocessing: The Special Needs staff members within the MTFs
   (SNCs and FMRC Coordinators) establish procedures, working with TRICARE and other
   MTF staff as needed, to ensure prompt identification of families with special needs during
   base inprocessing procedures. Existing base or medical inprocessing forums (such as ―Right
   Start‖) may be used.
      3.1.1.1. If necessary, the FMRC Coordinator contacts the losing base to obtain an
      existing SNAC file.
      3.1.1.2. The FMRC Coordinator ensures updated contact information is entered into AF
      Special Needs Data Management Systems.
   3.1.2. In the course of routine medical care: All medical staff will refer family members to
   the SNIAC office when conditions are identified that meet EFMP eligibility criteria as
   specified in DoDI 1315.19, Enclosure 4. Enrollment of the sponsor in EFMP is mandatory
   once eligibility is established, and does not require consent of family members or sponsors.
   Medical providers work collaboratively with the SNC to explain the EFMP to families and to
   elicit their cooperation.
   3.1.3. Upon notification of assignment action: The orders issuing agent (installation MPF
   outbound assignments offices, CSS, or AFPC through central orders processing functions)
   will query sponsors and data systems to determine if special needs exist in family members
   as soon as an assignment is identified (―RIP‖ generation), regardless of gaining location.
      3.1.3.1. MPF/CSS and/or AFPC will query all active duty sponsors not previously Q-
      coded about the presence of potential special needs in family members, using AF Form
      4380, Special Needs Screener. MPF/CSS and/or AFPC directs sponsors to the DoD
      definitions of ―special needs‖ in DoDI 1315.19, Enclosure 4, as needed when forming
      their responses. Negative responses are documented and assignment processing is
      continued. Sponsors providing responses indicating the presence of special needs or
      uncertainty are referred to the SNIAC office for guidance; orders will not be issued
      pending determination of EFMP eligibility by the SNC.
      3.1.3.2. All service members who have been previously Q-coded and all service
      members who plan to take family members OCONUS are referred to the SNIAC office to
      initiate the Family Member Relocation Clearance process as soon as possible after
      notification of projected assignment.
   3.1.4. When special needs that meet DoD criteria are identified by medical personnel, the
   following forms and documents are used as appropriate to initiate enrollment of AF active
   duty sponsors in EFMP/SNIAC.
      3.1.4.1. AF Form 2523, Special Needs Identification and Assignment Coordination
      Information Form
      3.1.4.2. DD Form 2005, Privacy Act Statement – Health Care Records
AFI40-701_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 19 APRIL 2011                                                  39


      3.1.4.3. DD Form 2792, Exceptional Family Member Medical Summary, with copies of
      supporting medical documentation specifying the condition(s)
      3.1.4.4. DD Form 2792-1, Exceptional Family Member Special Education/Early
      Intervention Summary, with copies of supporting educational documentation specifying
      the condition(s)
      3.1.4.5. Special Needs Coordinator‘s memorandum to AFPC, local MPF, or CSS (as
      appropriate), requesting initiation of Assignment Limitation Code ―Q.‖ All EFMP
      enrollment or disenrollment actions addressed to AFPC, MPF or CSS must be signed by
      the appointed Special Needs Coordinator at the base where the sponsor‘s personnel
      functions are managed.
   3.1.5. The AF Form 2523 informs the sponsor of the purpose of enrollment, the ways that
   information collected is used, and the limits to confidentiality. It is read and signed by the
   sponsor (as well as by adult family members where appropriate) and witnessed by the
   SNIAC staff at the time of enrollment to document the provision of this information.
   3.1.6. All other forms listed above are adopted for use in the SNIAC process and are
   described in their prescribing publications.
3.2. The Family Member Relocation Clearance (FMRC) Process.
   3.2.1. All active duty sponsors who desire to travel OCONUS with family members, any
   who are accepting a remote unaccompanied assignment with an accompanied OCONUS
   follow-on, or are accepting a Consecutive Overseas Tour, must initiate the FMRC process at
   the SNIAC office as soon as possible in the relocation process. All active duty sponsors
   already enrolled in the EFMP must also initiate the FMRC process at the SNIAC office for
   all CONUS assignment locations and report if the family member(s) with special needs
   request government-sponsored travel. DoD civilians accepting overseas employment who
   report special needs in family members and who request information about capabilities in the
   gaining location are supported using the same methods as those provided to families of active
   duty members.
   3.2.2. The FMRC process consists first of a review of medical, dental, and educational
   records, and a survey of existing data bases (such as pharmacy records or patient encounter
   histories) in order to elicit information about service needs projected at the gaining location.
   All known conditions or treatments that may present increased risk are considered. The SNC,
   or qualified designee, reviews all electronic and hardcopy medical records, mental health
   summaries, service history documentation from Family Advocacy Program, educational
   documentation, or other information available and plans a conjoint interview with the MRO.
      3.2.2.1. All family members of active duty sponsors relocating OCONUS must be seen
      and interviewed by the SNC and MRO. Family members of majority age are offered
      private interviews, and the MTF staff ensures no unauthorized disclosures of protected
      health information are made during the relocation process. Where the family member is a
      minor, the parent/legal guardian is interviewed for pertinent health history of the minor
      child, and the child must be seen by the SNC and MRO. The SNC and MRO remain
      vigilant for documented health services that are protected from disclosure to the parent(s)
      and ensure private interviews are offered where warranted. Where these procedures are
      not possible, exceptions are noted and forwarded to the gaining base for consideration.
40                          AFI40-701_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 19 APRIL 2011


     3.2.2.2. All family members of active duty sponsors relocating to the CONUS who have
     identified special needs are seen and interviewed by the SNC and MRO. Family members
     of majority age are offered private interviews. Where the family member is a minor, the
     parent/legal guardian is interviewed for pertinent health history of the minor child, and
     the child must be seen by the SNC and MRO. The SNC and MRO remain vigilant for
     documented health services that are protected from disclosure to the parent(s) and ensure
     private interviews are offered where warranted.
         3.2.2.2.1. The sponsor must report all family members requesting travel via AF Form
         1466, and indicate the presence of any service needs, or recent history of specialized
         care, for further evaluation as a potential special need. The SNC and MRO may
         request an interview with a family member not previously identified as having a
         special need prior to CONUS relocation where further review may be warranted.
         Where these procedures are not possible, exceptions are noted and forwarded to the
         gaining base for consideration.
  3.2.3. Family members of DoD civilians are offered an interview with the SNC and MRO
  where the civilian sponsor has requested assistance in determining availability of services in
  the overseas location. They are not required to participate in any component of the family
  member relocation clearance process other than disclosure of special needs to the civilian
  personnel hiring agency when asked. DoD civilian sponsors are not required to complete the
  AF Form 1466, but it may be used if the sponsor voluntarily agrees to the use of the form for
  process coordination. The DD Form 2792 and DD Form 2792-1 are required to document
  special needs of family members of DoD civilian sponsors where OCONUS relocation
  assistance is requested by the family.
  3.2.4. Wherever medical records are not readily available to the MTF, the family members
  must provide copies to the SNIAC FMRC Coordinator. Any request for medical information
  that is not provided or released by a family member may result in the inability of the SNIAC
  office to process the clearance review. For families of DoD civilians, this may limit the
  ability to provide information about services in the gaining location. For families of active
  duty members, refusal to provide or release needed information will limit the ability of the
  SNIAC office to process an FDI and will therefore preclude authorization for government-
  sponsored travel.
  3.2.5. The SNC at the losing installation ensures accuracy/legibility of all documentation,
  and forwards the complete relocation package to the losing installation‘s SGH for review and
  signature.
     3.2.5.1. All packages involving a special needs family member of an active duty member
     (sponsor is ―Q-coded‖) must be forwarded via FDI to the gaining base after review by the
     SGH at the losing base.
     3.2.5.2. Where there are no special needs that meet enrollment criteria for a family of an
     active duty sponsor, the SGH determines if the package requires review by the gaining
     base. Generally, if there are needs identified that might require services other than those
     deliverable by a primary care manager, the entire FDI package is transmitted to the
     gaining base for review and travel recommendations. This includes pregnancy during the
     course of the anticipated permanent-change-of-station travel.
AFI40-701_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 19 APRIL 2011                                                  41


  3.2.6. If there are any conditions newly identified in the course of the FMRC process that
  meet EFMP enrollment criteria as specified in DoDI 1315.19, Enclosure 4, the SNC ensures
  enrollment of the sponsor in EFMP is initiated at the losing installation prior to sending the
  FDI to the gaining installation for review. A copy of the Q-code initiation letter is attached to
  the FDI package, indicating the date the request for enrollment was sent and to whom. Where
  the special need is identified in an adult family member, the SNIAC staff does not disclose
  the nature of the special need to the sponsor without the adult family member‘s consent.
  3.2.7. Every FDI is tracked electronically through AF authorized data management systems,
  such as ―Q-base‖, in order to facilitate review at all levels within SNIAC. This enables
  MAJCOM and AF-level oversight for purposes such as data collection, workload monitoring,
  and assistance where needed.
     3.2.7.1. Information pertaining to FDIs of Q-coded sponsors will be noted separately
     within databases from those of non-Q-coded sponsors (active duty and DoD civilians).
  3.2.8. Written consent from adult family members is not required to release information
  between military medical departments to support the family‘s request for government
  sponsored travel. The military health system may use existent databases in order to identify
  individuals with health conditions that require further consideration prior to making
  recommendations for government-sponsored travel, and may recommend against travel
  where insufficient information has been provided to support decision-making.
     3.2.8.1. Family members of majority age are asked to provide consent to release health
     information to support their applications for government sponsored travel wherever
     release outside the military health system is needed to coordinate travel
     recommendations. Examples include travel to OCONUS areas where host nation
     providers must be consulted. However, where this consent is not obtained, information
     about family member health histories that is known to the MTFs may be forwarded to
     Health Affairs agents with a need to know via the FMRC process for the stated purpose
     of assignment coordination.
     3.2.8.2. Where a family member of majority age (consult with SJA as needed, age of
     majority varies depending on types of treatment obtained) has not provided consent to
     release health information to the sponsor, MTF staff may not disclose such information to
     the sponsor or other family member(s). Responses to inquiries from the sponsor/parent or
     from the unit regarding recommendations against travel for family members of majority
     age who have not given consent to release health information are coordinated with the
     SGH and SJA.
  3.2.9. Where no needs are identified in the outbound review process for families of active
  duty sponsors, the losing base SGH may recommend travel. The SGH at the losing base
  returns the signed AF Form 1466 with supporting documentation to the FMRC Coordinator.
  The FMRC Coordinator then logs the disposition and forwards the necessary information to
  the orders issuing agent indicating ―no needs, travel recommended for all family members.‖
  All pages of the AF Form 1466 are forwarded to the orders issuing agent where there is no
  health information requiring protection.
42                         AFI40-701_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 19 APRIL 2011


  3.2.10. All documentation of the review process for families of DoD civilian sponsors is
  forwarded to the gaining base (or designated review authority) for review and evaluation of
  service availability.
  3.2.11. When an FDI is indicated, the package is logged by the losing FMRC Coordinator
  and is sent in a HIPAA-compliant manner to the gaining location‘s FMRC Coordinator or
  other designated review authority (e.g., to the gaining OCONUS MAJCOM/SGO where
  there is no MTF). The gaining SGH or designated review authority makes the determination
  on appropriateness of family member travel and lists recommendations individually by
  family member name on page 4 of the AF Form 1466, ensuring a response is returned to the
  sending base within 14 calendar days of receipt of a completed FDI package. The FMRC
  Coordinator at the receiving base also logs all inbound FDIs with
  disposition/recommendations noted.
     3.2.11.1. For active duty sponsors, the recommendations (―travel recommended‖ or
     ―travel not recommended‖ for each family member) are returned to the FMRC
     Coordinator for documentation. The FMRC Coordinator at the gaining installation
     forwards the determination to the FMRC Coordinator at the losing installation for action.
     When coordinating with orders-issuing agents, the FMRC Coordinator at the losing
     installation appropriately protects any protected health information on the AF Form 1466
     and in the FDI package, and forwards only the information pertaining to the travel
     recommendations for each specified family member to the orders‘ issuing agent. Where
     there is health information on pages 2 and 3 of AF Form 1466, they are separated by the
     FMRC Coordinator prior to submission of pages 1, 4 and 5 to the orders issuing agent.
     The FMRC Coordinator(s) ensure any health information contained on any page of the
     AF Form 1466 is masked prior to release to orders-issuing agents.
         3.2.11.1.1. If providing a response of recommendation against family travel to any
         active duty AF sponsor, informs the sponsor of the pinpoint process for OCONUS
         assignments and of the option to apply for EFMP reassignment via the vMPF, if
         applicable.
     3.2.11.2. For Senior Leader assignments, the gaining review authority notifies the
     appropriate assignment coordinating office of any recommendations against family
     member travel, in addition to notifying the losing FMRC Coordinator. These notifications
     do not release the medical or educational reasons, only the status of the recommendations
     for each family member. If a request to an OCONUS location for accompanied family
     member travel is returned with ―travel not recommended‖, the gaining MAJCOM SNIAC
     Consultant notifies the agencies below after review of the base level recommendations
     against travel. If a request for accompanied family member travel to a CONUS location is
     returned ―not recommended‖, the gaining SNIAC office notifies the following agencies:
         3.2.11.2.1. AF/DPG for no-travel recommendations for General Officer‘s family
         members.
         3.2.11.2.2. AF/DPO for no-travel recommendations for Colonel and Colonel-selects‘
         family members.
         3.2.11.2.3. AF/DPE for no-travel recommendations for Chief Master Sergeant‘s
         family members.
AFI40-701_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 19 APRIL 2011                                               43


         3.2.11.2.4. AF/DPS for limitations in family service capabilities for Senior Executive
         Service‘s (SES) family members.
         3.2.11.2.5. AFMOA/SGHW and AFMOA/SGOQ will ensure coordination with these
         agencies for Senior Leader clearances into areas not reviewed by an AF SNIAC
         office or MAJCOM SNIAC Consultant.
     3.2.11.3. For all DoD civilians, information about service availability and limitations
     related to the identified needs are returned to the selectee. They may be transmitted
     through the losing FMRC Coordinator upon request. It is the selectee‘s responsibility to
     notify the hiring civilian personnel agency of completion of the process and for making
     final decisions regarding relocation of family members.
     3.2.11.4. Where the gaining base has provided comments in response to an FDI about
     location-unique considerations, about types of housing modifications planned, etc., this
     type of information is shared with the sponsor and/or adult family member(s) by the
     losing SNIAC office upon receipt.
  3.2.12. For OCONUS assignments: The FMRC process is initiated for ALL active duty
  sponsors who intend to take family members to OCONUS areas, regardless of prior EFMP
  status. Family members who travel overseas without command sponsorship are at risk of
  reduced or non-available medical care, loss of benefits such as base privileges or housing,
  and may incur significant personal expense when further relocation is needed. All sponsors
  who intentionally bypass the clearance process or who falsify information risk disciplinary
  action.
     3.2.12.1. The FDI package for OCONUS assignments, including Consecutive Overseas
     Tours (COTs) and follow-ons from unaccompanied tours, consists of one AF Form 1466
     per family (permissible but not required for DoD civilian families), the AF Form 1466D
     for every family member 2 years of age and older, the DD Form 2792 for each family
     member with special needs or needs for specialized medical services, and the DD Form
     2792-1 for ALL children aged 3 – 21 years.
         3.2.12.1.1. Family members of active duty sponsors requesting accompanied
         OCONUS relocation who have a history of, or potential future need for, any medical
         service(s) beyond routine primary care will submit DD Form 2792 as the medical
         summary. This form is used to support review for EFMP enrollment eligibility, as
         well as for assessment of availability of needed care via FDI if it is determined that
         EFMP enrollment criteria are not met.
         3.2.12.1.2. The DD Form 2792-1 is additionally completed for all children birth to 3
         years of age that have been identified with (or are at risk of) developmental delay. DD
         Forms 2792-1 are signed by early intervention and/or special educational authorities.
         Families with home-schooled children must submit a DD Form 2792-1 for each child
         over the age of 3 years, that is signed by the local school system, and that documents
         either the delivery of special educational services in the past, or certifies that no
         special educational services have been recommended or provided.
     3.2.12.2. The AF Form 1466 must be signed by the appointed SGH and final
     review/authorization for travel of families of active duty AF members may not be
     provided by network or sister Service providers. Sister Service providers may assist in the
44                          AFI40-701_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 19 APRIL 2011


     collection of information on the AF Form 1466 for review by the AF SGH. All other
     forms must be signed by a qualified medical provider/educational authority and only
     current versions of all AF and DD forms may be used. Medical summaries or cover
     memos may be used in lieu of AF Form 1466 for special needs family members of DoD
     civilians.
     3.2.12.3. When an active duty AF sponsor assigned OCONUS has a child, or adopts a
     child, in a location outside the theater of assignment, the FMRC process is completed by
     the closest AF installation for the new dependent, prior to accompanied travel to the duty
     location. Where necessary, the closest AF MTF may request documentation from civilian
     providers or sister Service MTF staff to support review of medical needs by the gaining
     base. These circumstances are documented on the AF Form 1466, with the base of
     assignment of the sponsor noted as the gaining location. The SGH at the sponsor‘s
     current duty location OCONUS makes travel recommendations based on review of
     documented health status.
        3.2.12.3.1. MTF staff involved in coordinating arrangements for active duty AF
        families to travel in order to safely deliver the infant(s) safely (e.g., ―storknesting‖
        programs) must advise families of this procedure prior to departure from the base of
        assignment.
        3.2.12.3.2. MTF staff involved in perinatal care of families of active duty AF, known
        to reside under government sponsorship OCONUS but who have traveled outside the
        country of assignment to deliver or adopt a child or children, must advise families of
        this procedure and assist in the process prior to release from care.
        3.2.12.3.3. MTF staff involved in infant care at OCONUS installations will monitor
        through well-baby checks all infants that are newly presented for care and ensure the
        family is counseled on requirements for command-sponsorship OCONUS. Where
        necessary, the clinical staff delivering infant care will consult with the SNC.
        3.2.12.3.4. If it is determined that the new dependent cannot be adequately cared for
        in the location of the sponsor‘s OCONUS assignment, EFMP enrollment and
        reassignment is initiated immediately. Families are cautioned against traveling with
        an infant or young child into OCONUS areas without command sponsorship.
     3.2.12.4. When an FDI to an OCONUS location is returned with one or more family
     members ―not recommended‖ for travel, the base that cannot accommodate the family
     redirects the FDI to the gaining MAJCOM SNIAC Consultant for ―pinpoint‖ assignment
     consideration. This ensures all active duty sponsors are given opportunities to serve tours
     of duty OCONUS IAW Assignments policy. The gaining MAJCOM SNIAC Consultant
     determines alternate location(s), if any, within the command that can accommodate the
     needs of family members.
     3.2.12.5. Where travel is not recommended OCONUS for Senior Leaders‘ family
     members, the gaining MAJCOM SNIAC Consultant advises the appropriate branch
     AF/A1 Senior Leader Office as listed in para. 3.2.11.2 of this instruction, in addition to
     other required notifications. The appropriate Senior Leader Office will work with all
     affected parties to develop courses of action, which may include continuing forward with
     the assignment in unaccompanied status. Where no AF MAJCOM SNIAC Consultant
AFI40-701_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 19 APRIL 2011                                               45


     exists for the region of the potential assignment, AFMOA/SGHW and AFMOA/SGOQ
     ensure coordination with AF/A1.
  3.2.13. For CONUS assignments: The FMRC process is required for active duty sponsors
  who have assignment limitation code ―Q‖, also known as Q-coded. It may additionally be
  completed where medical conditions are known to the MTF that are determined to be a risk
  for family member travel to the identified location, but that do not meet DoD criteria for
  enrollment. This includes temporary conditions (such as high risk pregnancy), or conditions
  that are mild in the current location but are expected to exacerbate in the environment of the
  proposed location. All family members are listed by the sponsor on the AF Form 1466, who
  indicates the presence or absence of service needs or special needs for each family member
  in the appropriate sections of the form.
     3.2.13.1. The losing base SNC and MRO will evaluate any reported needs to determine
     if they meet the definition as a special need prior to completion of the FMRC process.
     Initiation of Q-code request letter is the responsibility of the sending base where
     eligibility is determined in the relocation process. A copy of the letter requesting
     assignment limitation code ―Q,‖ signed by the SNC, is forwarded with the FDI where the
     condition meeting enrollment criteria is newly identified. Information pertaining to the
     family member(s) whose conditions meet the DoD criteria as special needs are forwarded
     to the gaining MTF via FDI using DD Forms 2792 and 2792-1.
     3.2.13.2. If MPF, CSS, or AFPC identifies the potential for special needs in a family
     member of a non-Q-coded sponsor based on a report by the sponsor or unit command
     representative, AFPC, the MPF, or the CSS will refer the sponsor to SNIAC first for
     enrollment eligibility determination prior to the issuance of orders. Where possible, this
     referral includes a completed AF Form 4380, Special Needs Screener.
     3.2.13.3. The FDI package for CONUS assignments consists of one AF Form 1466 per
     family, the DD Form 2792, DD Form 2792-1 (for school aged children), and the AF
     Form 1466D, one each for the identified special needs family member(s) only. All forms
     used must be in the most current published version. All specified forms are required for
     each special needs family member to certify the presence or absence of specialized
     care/service needs. All forms must be signed by a qualified medical provider/educational
     authority, and the AF Form 1466 must be signed by the appointed SGH at the AF MTF.
     Sister Service providers may assist in the collection of information on the AF Form 1466
     for review by the AF SGH. DD Forms 2792 and AF Forms 1466D may be completed by
     civilian specialists familiar with the care provided as outlined in para. 3.4.4 FDIs for
     active duty families relocating within CONUS do not meet EFMP criteria but who
     require or request a review to ensure travel safety may include medical summaries or
     treatment histories in lieu of DD Forms 2792 where enrollment criteria are not met.
     3.2.13.4. Where travel is not recommended for family members to CONUS locations due
     to the non-availability of needed medical services, the losing FMRC Coordinator, in
     coordination with the SNC, notifies the orders-issuing agent that travel was not
     recommended. The sponsor must apply to AFPC for EFMP reassignment via the virtual
     MPF. AFPC works with the service member to identify an alternate assignment and the
     FMRC process is re-initiated to the alternate location(s).
46                           AFI40-701_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 19 APRIL 2011


     3.2.13.5. Where travel is not recommended to a CONUS location for Senior Leader
     family members, the gaining FMRC Coordinator advises the appropriate AF/A1 Senior
     Leader Office as listed in para. 3.2.11.2 of this instruction, in addition to other required
     notifications. The reasons for the no-travel recommendation are not released to the Senior
     Leader Office, only the status of the recommendations. The appropriate Senior Leader
     Office will work with all affected parties to determine courses of action, which may
     include continuing forward with the assignment in unaccompanied status.
  3.2.14. Where special needs are known via Q-code, or prior to any OCONUS relocation, an
  FMRC review must be completed within 6-months of government sponsored family member
  travel. This is to ensure the most recent medical and educational information is available to
  the review authorities. The sponsor must notify the SNC at the base of current assignment of
  any changes in family member conditions or in needed services that are identified after the
  initiation of the clearance process and before initiation of family travel.
  3.2.15. The SNIAC office at the current base of assignment of the sponsor retains
  responsibility for the coordination of the FDI at each stage of the process and requests
  support from the MTF closest to the family in conducting interviews, records reviews, etc. If
  there is no MTF within a reasonable travel distance, documentation from the civilian
  providers is requested by the sponsor‘s SNIAC office. After review for clinical sufficiency
  by the SGH at the sponsor‘s base of current assignment, the documentation is submitted to
  the gaining location for consideration. Refer to section 3.4.3 of this instruction for additional
  guidance where sponsors and family members are geographically separated at the time of
  initiation of the FMRC process.
     3.2.15.1. In limited circumstances it may be necessary for AFMOA/SGHW to designate
     non-medical points-of-contact (POCs) to coordinate FDIs into OCONUS locations not
     served by a gaining MTF. When this is necessary, AFMOA/SGHW, and any MTF that
     releases specific protected information, will instruct those POCs in the proper storage,
     transmission, and protection of family member information from unauthorized disclosure
     or release. The losing SNIAC office ensures the authorization to release medical
     information is noted to specify the designated non-medical POC and the specific purpose
     of the release. Consents obtained to release this information are retained as required
     under MTF HIPAA guidance. AFMOA/SGHW will specify routing procedures to ensure
     qualified AF medical authorities make final travel recommendations for government
     sponsored travel.
  3.2.16. The following procedures apply when any active duty AF sponsor is scheduled for an
  OCONUS unaccompanied assignment of 15 months or less.
     3.2.16.1. Sponsor may choose a Designated Location Move, and relocate family
     members to any location within the CONUS while serving overseas in unaccompanied
     status. Relocation of family members to a follow-on location may only be authorized if
     the follow-on assignment is approved; see para. 3.2.16.3 Where special needs have been
     identified prior to a Designated Location Move within the CONUS, an FDI is forwarded
     to the closest AF SNIAC office for recommendations since the family will relocate at
     government expense. The reviewing AF SGH will ensure the family is advised regarding
     the extent of MTF services available at their chosen location and which services will be
     provided by TRICARE network providers.
AFI40-701_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 19 APRIL 2011                                                 47


     3.2.16.2. Sponsor may choose a home-basing option and, if approved, will be reassigned
     back to the same CONUS location of prior assignment after completion of the short
     overseas tour. No FMRC process is needed since the family will not be traveling at
     government expense. This home basing assignment opportunity is limited for senior
     leaders.
     3.2.16.3. Sponsor may request and receive a follow-on assignment to either a CONUS or
     OCONUS location. This assignment is provided prior to the member‘s departure for the
     short overseas tour.
         3.2.16.3.1. All sponsors requesting family travel to an OCONUS follow-on location
         initiate the FMRC process prior to sponsor‘s departure to the unaccompanied tour.
         All EFMP-enrolled sponsors (―Q-coded‖) selected for an unaccompanied assignment
         with an accompanied follow-on to either a CONUS or an OCONUS location initiate
         the FMRC process and an FDI is generated to the follow-on base prior to the issuance
         of orders to the unaccompanied assignment. If travel is not recommended for one or
         more family members in either situation, the sponsor may apply for reassignment
         consideration prior to departure for the short overseas tour.
             3.2.16.3.1.1. If travel to the follow-on is recommended for all family members,
             the family may initiate travel to the follow-on at government expense prior to the
             sponsor‘s departure for the short overseas tour. When the sponsor returns to the
             follow-on from the unaccompanied location, there is no FMRC process needed
             (even if sponsor is Q-coded) as the family will not be traveling at that time. The
             sponsor receives orders for unaccompanied travel to the follow-on location.
             3.2.16.3.1.2. If the family does not proceed to the follow-on location at that time
             but remains in place, a second FDI is initiated within 6 months prior to the
             relocation of family members to the follow-on location. The FDI is processed
             according to the guidance on geographically separated families in paragraph 3.4.3
             of this instruction. All family members authorized travel in the second FDI will be
             listed on the sponsor‘s orders to the follow-on location to support travel at
             government expense.
     3.2.16.4. A sponsor may relocate the family to any location at personal expense. Where
     special needs are known, an FDI to the proposed location is advised to support decision
     making and to determine accessibility to needed services. Sponsors remain responsible
     for promoting the well-being of family members regardless of location.
  3.2.17. Once a completed FDI package is received (in both CONUS and OCONUS
  locations), the gaining installation MTF has 14 calendar days to review all specified needs
  and provide a response to the losing installation FMRC Coordinator. If the gaining
  installation is unable to provide a response to the losing base within that time frame, a
  message must be sent to the losing FMRC Coordinator indicating the status and reason(s) for
  delay. If additional information is subsequently requested by the gaining base, the 14-day
  timeline is initiated upon receipt of all the information needed to review the FDI package.
  3.2.18. When there are no special needs identified in the clearance process, the FMRC
  Coordinator at the losing installation will forward to the orders issuing agent all pages of the
  AF Form 1466. Page 4 will be blank since an FDI is not sent to a gaining installation. When
 48                            AFI40-701_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 19 APRIL 2011


   special needs or needs for care have been identified in the clearance process, FRMC
   Coordinators at the losing installation will send pages 1, 4, and 5 of the AF Form 1466 to the
   orders issuing agent, once the completed package is returned from the gaining installation.
   Page 4 will list by name all family members cleared for government-sponsored travel and all
   not recommended for travel. Page 4 must be signed by the gaining location MTF's SGH or
   designated review authority. Where needs are identified, pages 2 and 3 will not be provided
   to orders issuing agents as they may contain sensitive medical information that must be
   protected. The FMRC Coordinator ensures no health information is marked on any page sent
   to an orders issuing agent.
   3.2.19. The losing FMRC Coordinator or SNC advises active duty sponsors of medical
   recommendations generated through the FMRC/FDI process, emphasizing that orders issuing
   agents retain final authority to authorize accompanied family travel.
3.3. Research and Evaluation.
   3.3.1. Research that supports professional knowledge about families with special needs, and
   that is designed to enhance the quality of life for families with special needs, may be
   supported by AFMOA and by SNIAC staff. All research proposals must meet current
   academic standards for research methods, must be approved by an Air Force Institutional
   Review Board, and must be authorized by AFMOA. All publications that report results of
   such research must be approved by AF Public Affairs prior to release.
   3.3.2. Program and Process Evaluation. AF SNIAC is committed to the delivery of effective
   and efficient services which support assignments, appropriate family member travel, and
   quality of life for military families.
      3.3.2.1. The AF SNIAC participates in all MTF, MAJCOM, and AF-level initiatives
      designed to monitor and enhance services to beneficiaries.
      3.3.2.2. IAW DoDI 1315.19, the AF will report annually to OSD (P & R) on the
      numbers of special needs family members of active duty sponsors and on the
      effectiveness of any processes implemented for the authorization of government-
      sponsored travel. AFPD 40-7 specifies key benchmarks for evaluating SNIAC process
      effectiveness for this purpose.
          3.3.2.2.1. SNIAC staff members will use the AF-provided data management systems
          to collect and manage data used to generate process evaluation reports.
      3.3.2.3. AFMOA and MAJCOM SNIAC Consultants may use aggregated data to
      enhance delivery of services and program evaluation.
3.4. Special Considerations.
   3.4.1. EFMP Reassignments and Deferments: EFMP reassignments/deferments are made at
   the sponsor‘s request only, and are submitted through the vMPF online. EFMP reassignments
   cannot be mandated by the commander or requested by the family member. Typically they
   are warranted where there is a lack of needed medical care for a family member with special
   needs, or where special education services required on an IEP or IFSP do not exist in the
   current location. AFPC provides information to the sponsor on what he or she needs to
   submit in the application package once initiated thru vMPF. AFPC/DPAPPH determines the
   appropriateness of the request and makes the final decision on all assignment actions,
AFI40-701_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 19 APRIL 2011                                                 49


  excepting those for Senior Leaders, which are forwarded by AFPC/DPAPPH to the
  appropriate branch of AF/DP for review.
     3.4.1.1. For EFMP Reassignment Requests, SNIAC staff at the base of sponsor
     assignment may release to DPAPPH any medical or educational documentation needed to
     process the request. SNIAC staff must attempt to contact family members of majority age
     to notify them of the release of this information, and the purpose for the release. SNIAC
     staff document these attempts in the SNAC file. However, inability to contact the family
     members directly does not prevent release of information to AFPC/DPAPPH to expedite
     timely reassignment considerations.
     3.4.1.2. If the EFMP reassignment request warrants approval by AFPC/DPAPPH, the
     medical and educational documentation is forwarded to the SNCs at several potential
     assignment locations simultaneously to expedite review. FDI packages sent to potential
     locations from AFPC/DPAPPH will include all the medical and educational
     documentation provided with the request. In most cases, this will include the DD Form
     2792, DD Form 2792-1 and IEP when applicable. It will not, as a rule, include an AF
     Form 1466. Gaining bases provide response directly to AFPC/DPAPPH via locally
     designed memorandum or other means acceptable to AFPC/DPAPPH. Gaining bases will
     prioritize responses on FDIs generated as result of EFMP Reassignment Requests and
     provide recommendations within 5 business days, or notify AFPC/DPAPPH of necessary
     response delays within 5 business days.
     3.4.1.3. In OCONUS areas, where the SNC and SGH concur that remaining in the local
     area poses a significant risk to the health and/or wellbeing of family members due to the
     lack of needed medical services or the limitation of resources, they may recommend to
     the MTF/CC the coordination of Early Return of Dependents (ERD) pending
     reassignment consideration.
     3.4.1.4. Where maintaining family members OCONUS in the absence of needed medical
     care, and where Family Advocacy is involved to review allegations of neglect, the
     assignment may be involuntarily curtailed under para. 3.8.10.2 in AFI 36-2110.
     3.4.1.5. The SNC will assist the sponsor in compiling appropriate medical/educational
     documentation for the EFMP Reassignment Package upon request.
     3.4.1.6. The SNC at the sponsor‘s current base of assignment will, in collaboration with
     the MRO and SGH, assess the availability of medical/educational services and will
     provide a letter regarding availability of services. The letter will contain the specifics of
     what services can or cannot be obtained at the sponsor‘s current location. The SNC does
     not make reassignment recommendations in the letter.
     3.4.1.7. Requests for deferment of assignment or deployment can only be made through
     AFPC and the sponsor‘s unit once the sponsor has been notified officially of a pending
     assignment or deployment. SNCs may support sponsors with similar documentation upon
     request, and must focus on the identified needs of family members and what benefit is
     expected by the authorization of a deferment, or what harm to the family member is
     anticipated by the timing of subject assignment or deployment. SNCs do not make
     deferment recommendations but rather provide supporting documentation as described.
  3.4.2. Requests to Reconsider Family Member Travel Denials (―Appeals‖)
50                          AFI40-701_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 19 APRIL 2011


     3.4.2.1. Within 21 calendar days of family receipt of a recommendation against family
     member travel (―denial‖), the family may submit additional new information for
     consideration through the losing base SNC. The intention of this provision is to allow the
     submission of significant information that the family believes was not available at the
     time of the initial review and determination, consideration of which might substantially
     change the risk assessment for the identified family member. The additional information
     provided is forwarded directly from losing base SNC to gaining base SNC, with no
     additional review by the losing installation needed. The losing FMRC Coordinator
     notifies the orders issuing agent that a review is pending, and notes the appeal on the FDI
     log.
         3.4.2.1.1. OCONUS, the gaining SNC who receives information submitted for an
         ―appeal‖ of the FDI recommendation notifies the gaining OCONUS MAJCOM
         SNIAC Consultant of the appeal and coordinates the review of information for either
         a base-level recommendation or a pinpoint review, as needed.
     3.4.2.2. The gaining SGH (or OCONUS MAJCOM SNIAC Consultant, as needed) is the
     final authority on what constitutes new information. The gaining SGH or OCONUS
     MAJCOM SNIAC Consultant may determine that subsequent information received does
     not constitute new or compelling information that would change the initial
     recommendation against travel, and the gaining SNIAC office will notify the losing SNC
     and/or FMRC Coordinator within 7 calendar days that the recommendation against travel
     stands. Where there is no MAJCOM SNIAC Consultant, AFMOA/SGOQ serves as the
     final authority for FDI appeals.
     3.4.2.3. Upon receipt of new information that is determined significant, the gaining SNC
     (or MAJCOM SNIAC Consultant) will send within 7 calendar days a reply to the losing
     SNC a message that the new information submitted is under evaluation. A response is
     provided to the losing installation within 14 days of receipt of the newly submitted
     information. If the initial decision is amended and family member travel that was
     previously denied is subsequently recommended on the basis of new information, the
     gaining SGH and SNC (or MAJCOM SNIAC Consultant) will provide a statement
     recommending travel to the losing SNIAC office, and may do so using the AF Form 1466
     (or other official messaging system) noting the change and date. The losing SNC and/or
     FMRC Coordinator will contact the orders-issuing agent to advise of the completion of
     the review process, will submit any needed notification of the results of the appeal review
     process, and will inform the family of the final determination, regardless of outcome.
     3.4.2.4. Expeditious assignment processing is paramount and requests to consider further
     information after two denials (the initial recommendation and the appeal) will not be
     considered, unless authorized by the gaining MAJCOM/SGO and the orders-issuing
     agent.
  3.4.3. Geographically Separated Sponsors and Families
     3.4.3.1. When family members are geographically separated from their sponsors
     (unaccompanied tours), the SNIAC office at the base of assignment of the sponsor (or
     base where sponsor‘s AF Personnel functions reside, for sponsors not assigned to AF
     installations) is responsible for coordinating all SNIAC functions.
AFI40-701_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 19 APRIL 2011                                                51


     3.4.3.2. When it is necessary to accomplish SNIAC clinical functions involving the
     family members (such as interviewing family members and/or reviewing current medical
     records for identification or family member relocation), the base where the sponsor is
     assigned may request assistance of the base nearest to the family (supporting base). The
     sponsor‘s base SNC or FMRC Coordinator initiates the request to the supporting base,
     specifying what is needed. Where the supporting base has never provided medical care
     and has no information to support the clearance, they may serve as a conduit of
     information between the sponsor‘s base SNIAC office and any civilian providers
     delivering care. The supporting base may conduct face-to-face interviews on behalf of the
     sponsor‘s base if located within a reasonable travel distance to allow family participation.
     3.4.3.3. It is the AD sponsor‘s responsibility for ensuring FMRC-related paperwork is
     completed and returned to the SNIAC staff (in both supporting and sponsor‘s base
     locations) in a timely manner, to include appropriately signed release of information
     documents as needed, when AD personnel are geographically separated from their family
     member(s).
     3.4.3.4. The supporting base completes needed processes as possible given the
     availability of records, access to family members for interview, etc., and documents for
     the sponsor‘s base what was accomplished and what sources of information were
     available. Where civilian network providers have delivered all recent medical care, or
     where family members are located at great distance from any MTF, the sponsor‘s base
     may work directly with the civilian providers to obtain completed forms and information
     to process the clearance, documenting the limitations on the available information. The
     supporting base may coordinate these requests with any civilian providers as needed at
     the request of the sponsor‘s base (obtaining appropriate consents to release health
     information as appropriate), ensuring all information flows through the sponsor‘s base as
     the process owner.
        3.4.3.4.1. Face-to-face interviews at a DoD MTF must be conducted except where
        extreme geographic distances, inpatient status, or other compelling health
        contraindications prohibit family travel to participate in the interview. In these rare
        circumstances, a sponsor‘s base or a supporting base may involve civilian providers
        to query family members on health conditions, providing specific instructions
        regarding the types of information needed. The SGH at the sponsor‘s base retains
        final discretion on the use of civilian providers in lieu of travel to an MTF for travel
        screening purposes. Also see para.s 2.18.2.3.1.4 and 2.20.1.5.4.
     3.4.3.5. The supporting base does not generate enrollment (―Q-code initiation letters‖),
     but rather sends documentation to the sponsor‘s base to do so as needed.
     3.4.3.6. Where a supporting base is involved in screening family members, the
     supporting base SGH signs on all AF Form 1466s but documents ―Clearance performed
     to support (name of sponsor‘s base)‖. The entire clearance package is then forwarded to
     the sponsor‘s base for action as the losing base. The sponsor‘s base SNC and SGH review
     all recommendations and the sponsor‘s base FMRC Coordinator logs/processes the
     package in the same manner as all other outbound clearances. The SGH at the sponsor‘s
     base of assignment (losing base) determines when an FDI is warranted, regardless of
     whether a civilian network provider or supporting MTF provided information.
 52                          AFI40-701_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 19 APRIL 2011


      3.4.3.7. Any questions or concerns by the sponsor‘s base about the review performed by
      the supporting base are addressed between sponsor base SNC and supporting base SNC,
      or between sponsor base SGH and supporting base SGH. The sponsor‘s base is
      considering the losing base when coordinating an FDI to the gaining base. The gaining
      base SNIAC staff may contact the supporting base with any questions but should only do
      so in coordination with the sponsor‘s base.
   3.4.4. Medical Care delivered by a Sister Service or Civilian Health Care Provider: When
   family members of active duty sponsors are empanelled to the MTF of a Sister Service, or
   when family members receive their primary and/or specialty care outside of the MTF, the AF
   SNC at the base of assignment of the AF sponsor (or where the AF personnel functions for
   the servicemember are located) remains the primary POC for SNIAC functions, both
   identification and family relocation. Also see para.s 2.18.2.3.1.4, 2.20.1.5.4, and 3.4.3.4.
      3.4.4.1. The SNC, or designee, will advise AF sponsors and families that neither civilian
      providers nor providers in Sister Service MTFs may provide authorization for AF family
      member travel. Non-AF care providers and all school authorities contribute supporting
      information for AF decision-making through the SNC at the losing installation. Only AF
      SGHs may make official travel recommendations for families of active duty AF
      servicemembers under government sponsorship.
      3.4.4.2. When the SNC/SGH at the losing installation need information from outside
      sources to conduct the FMRC process (such as health summaries, medication histories,
      dental summaries, etc), the SNIAC office will provide the sponsor, and family members
      of majority age if geographically separated, with written instructions to share with service
      providers that specify what is needed and how to submit the information (e.g., proper
      completion of AF Form 1466D, DD Form 2792, and any other forms or documentation as
      needed.). SNIAC staff will ensure families are instructed in how to provide their civilian
      providers the appropriate consent to release this information to the military health system
      for FMRC purposes.
3.5. Maintenance of Documentation:
   3.5.1. Administrative notes of processes and forms used to review medical or educational
   information for the purpose of determining EFMP enrollment eligibility, or for the purpose of
   coordinating family member travel where there are no special needs identified (FMRC and
   FDI packages for non-Q-coded sponsors), are not considered medical care records. Files may
   be created electronically and/or in hardcopy to store copies of forms and documents used in
   the decision making process to ensure process accountability.
      3.5.1.1. Logs of all relocation clearances performed will be maintained in each SNIAC
      office and OCONUS MAJCOMs (for pinpoint assignment considerations) and will
      document disposition/status of all clearances. They are maintained in accordance with the
      Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Privacy Act, and other
      MTF requirements in the SNIAC office for 2 years past the conclusion of the process, to
      support any needed investigation by MAJCOM, AFPC or AFMOA. Documents that have
      been requested to support a review may not be shredded until released by
      AFPC/DPAPPH and AFMOA.
AFI40-701_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 19 APRIL 2011                                               53


     Logs of disclosures outside the military health system for the purpose of determining
     suitability for government sponsored travel are maintained for the duration specified
     under MTF HIPAA guidance. Otherwise, these logs are shredded 2 years after
     completion of the last clearance on the page, IAW AFRIMS Table 41 – 12, Rule 22.00.
     3.5.1.2. Documentation pertaining to the relocation process for non-Q-coded sponsors,
     including any FDIs generated, forms completed, and correspondence, are filed by name
     of sponsor, with date of review completion. This FMRC/FDI documentation is
     maintained at both the losing and gaining installations (following HIPAA, Privacy Act,
     and MTF requirements) for 2 years after completion of the review process to support any
     investigation by MAJCOM, AFPC or AFMOA. Those documents that have been
     requested to support a review may not be shredded until released by AFPC/DPAPPH and
     AFMOA. Signed consents used to release information to entities outside of the military
     health system for the purpose of determining suitability for government sponsored travel
     are maintained in the manner and for the duration specified MTF HIPAA guidance. If not
     requested to support a review and if not involving release of information outside of the
     military health system, they may be shredded 2 years after completion of the review
     process IAW AFRIMS.
  3.5.2. Where special needs are identified, and upon initiation of assignment limitation code-
  Q, a Special Needs Assignment Coordination (SNAC) file is established and is maintained
  separately from medical records.
     3.5.2.1. The SNAC file is a compilation of documents and summaries of information that
     exist in original form in medical records and in educational records, and is considered a
     secondary medical record.
     3.5.2.2. SNAC files are maintained in accordance with HIPAA and other MTF
     requirements in order to protect the sensitive information contained therein. Access is
     limited to MTF staff with a need to know in order to support assignment
     recommendations.
     3.5.2.3. SNAC files are transferred to the gaining SNIAC office with each PCS and are
     maintained so long as the sponsor remains active duty, the condition(s) exist in the family
     member(s) which met eligibility criteria, and so long as the family member(s) identified
     with special needs remain(s) in official dependent status. If any one of these conditions
     changes, the SNAC record is maintained locally for 2 years at the last base where EFMP
     enrollment was in effect, and then shredded IAW AFRIMS.
         3.5.2.3.1. A copy of the SNAC file may be kept at the location closest to the family
         member(s) when geographically separated from the sponsor, or at the losing base
         pending confirmation of receipt of the original SNAC file when transferred for PCS.
  3.5.3. The SNAC file contains:
     3.5.3.1. The SNIAC demographic information page, informed consent documents,
     eligibility for services, and other materials obtained during the enrollment process. These
     materials are maintained during the sponsor‘s entire AF career, and may be updated. All
     consents, whether original or updates, are maintained the entire life of the SNAC record.
 54                           AFI40-701_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 19 APRIL 2011


       3.5.3.2. The names of all family members with special needs and the qualifying
       enrollment conditions identified for each, with supporting documentation obtained from
       the family or service providers. These pages are updated as needed, with previous
       documentation related to names and conditions maintained for the life of the record.
       3.5.3.3. The FDI documentation pertaining to relocation actions for the family for the
       last two assignments. FDI documentation for assignments prior to the previous two FDIs
       (with the exception of consents received that must be retained under existing HIPAA
       guidance) may be shredded with a dated, signed note entered in the SNAC record of
       appropriate disposal of prior FDI documentation.
       3.5.3.4. Documentation of coordinating services delivered by SNIAC, such as follow-up
       contacts and referrals made, are maintained in the SNAC record during two full
       assignments. Service notes from a location more than two assignments prior may be
       shredded or kept at the discretion of the SNC. If shredded, a dated, signed note is entered
       in the SNAC record indicating such disposition.
       3.5.3.5. E-mailed or faxed correspondence pertaining to service coordination.
3.6. Standards of Care. SNIAC will comply with Air Force Inspection Agency, Health
Services Inspection, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organization
standards, or Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care standards, and other AF-
sanctioned quality assurance mechanisms.
3.7. Standards of Practice. Standards of practice are the parameters of service provision as
permitted by licensure and/or an accredited body. The scope of practice for medical providers is
covered in AFI 44-119, Clinical Performance Improvement.
3.8. Application of Standards. The standards and guidance stated in this document apply to
active duty, civilian, and contract personnel providing special needs identification, Family
Member Relocation Clearances, process evaluation to include data collection and data
management, and support to AF sponsors with family members.
3.9. Prescribed Forms.
   3.9.1. Outbound active duty personnel will submit the AF 4380, Special Needs Screener, to
   AFPC, CSS or MPF agents upon request. See para.s 2.11.5 and 3.1.1 of this instruction.
   3.9.2. The following prescribed forms are initiated by the sponsor when requesting
   accompanied PCS travel as described in this instruction, refer to para. 3.2 et. seq. of this
   instruction. Each form specifies which sections are completed by qualified medical
   personnel.
       3.9.2.1. AF Form 1466, Request for Family Member’s Medical and Education Clearance
       for Travel
       3.9.2.2. AF Form 1466D, Dental Health Summary
       3.9.2.3. AF Form 2523, Special Needs Identification and Assignment Coordination
