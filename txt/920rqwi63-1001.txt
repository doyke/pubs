This Operating Instruction identifies and defines program responsibilities for the 920 MXG
Aircraft Structural Integrity Program. It applies to all personnel assigned to the 920 RQW. It
implements AFI 63-1001, Aircraft Structural Integrity Program, and references AFI 21-101,
Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Management, and current Joint Airframe Condition
Evaluation (JACE) Workload Agreement for Air Force H-60 Helicopters.
Coordination/approval at the 920 RQW will be accomplished by an electronically signed AF
Form 673, Air Force Publication/Form Action Request (AF Form 673). Do not use e-mails for
final coordination/approval, but all e-mails will be maintained as part of the record set. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route
AF Form 847s from the field through Major Command (MAJCOM) publications/forms
managers. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication
are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of
Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Information Management
System      (AFRIMS)         Records     Disposition      Schedule      (RDS)      located      at

1. General. An Aircraft Structural Integrity Program is required to manage assigned HH-60Gs
and C-130P/N’s. This program is managed under the Joint Airframe Condition Evaluation
(JACE) program for Air Force H-60 Helicopters and Inspection Corrosion and Repair Recording
(ICARR) for the C-130. JACE is managed by Warner-Robins ALC/SOFSA as the Air Force
OPR in conjunction with the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile command (AMCOM). All Air
Force HH-60Gs will be inspected according to JACE policy directives and technical procedures
by certified JACE inspectors. The ICARR program is intended to facilitate the collection and

display of inspection, corrosion, and repair data for the C-130 fleet and is managed by WR/ALC.
This data is temporarily stored in a user’s computer's hard drive and it must be downloaded
periodically into the central C-130 Automated Inspection, Repair, Corrosion, and Aircraft
Tracking (AIRCAT) system resident in Warner Robins ALC. Users with an internet connection
and valid access accounts in the AIRCAT system can use the on-line download utility in the
AIRCAT program to automatically transfer data to and from the AIRCAT database. The ICARR
program provides the tools to input, validate, review and edit inspection, damage, and repair data
for C-130 aircraft.
     1.1. The Loads Environmental Spectra Survey (L/ESS) system is installed on 3 HH-60G
     aircraft, tail numbers 6230, 6236 and 6238. Data is collected on Mercer Engineering
     Research Data Recorder to obtain time history records of parameters necessary to define the
     actual stress spectra for critical areas of the airframe: Flight Control Rod/Clevis, Servo
     Support, Main Rotor blades and Primary Structure. Data is offloaded using portable memory
     chip after every 50 flight hours by the QA office. QA mails the memory chip using a prepaid
     envelope to Mercer Eng. Research Center, 135 Osigian Blvd Warner Robins GA 31088.Time
     interval to swap chip are in the JST and scheduled by Plans and Scheduling (P&S).
2. Responsibilities:
     2.1. The Fabrication Flight Chief is designated unit ASIP Project Officer.
     2.2. Maintenance personnel will prepare and configure aircraft as needed.
     2.3. P&S will maintain hard copies of JACE workload agreements, aircraft inspection
     worksheets and is the official repository for JACE inspection data and related maintenance
     documentation (e.g., AFTO 781 series forms, AFTO 95s, and MIS data). P&S updates
     AFTO Form 95s and creates Job Standards per the JACE Workload Agreement.
     2.4. NDI will input inspections and repairs into the ICARR program. An inspection record is
     required to cover damage and inspection results collected from directed NDI inspections or
     damage found during the course of the aircraft’s maintenance or operation. An inspection is
     an ongoing maintenance event defined by a unique combination of aircraft tail number, type
     of maintenance code (i.e., ISO no. 1 inspection), date and TCTO when applicable. Only the
     date of the first record for the inspection is stored to cover all discrepancies and NDI records
     generated while completing the inspection.
     2.5. Structural maintenance evaluates inspection results to determine if the required repairs
     can be made at the unit level. Structural maintenance inputs data using the ICARR program
     only when a repair is accomplished.
        2.5.1. In the event structural maintenance determines that the repair(s) are either not
        within the unit’s capabilities or there is insufficient technical data to effect the repair,
        structural maintenance will initiate a Maintenance Assistance Request IAW 00-25-107
        and forward to QA for coordination and release.
     2.6. Quality assurance monitors ASIP, provides technical support and trains QA personnel
     on the data collecting method for the L/ESS system at home and deployed locations.
     2.7. Procedures to support ASIP at Deployed Location are, prior to deploying, the 920
     Maintenance Group Client Support Administrators will install ICARR (Inspection Corrosion
     and Repair Recording) on a laptop. At the deployed location, the laptop will be connected to
920RQWI63-1001 22 OCTOBER 2012                                                               3


  the internet using a secure IP address. ASIP data will be entered into the ICARR program
  using this laptop. Deployed locations that cannot support a secure connection, ASIP data will
  be forward via phone to the 920th Maintenance Group ASIP Project Officer. QA or a
  designated representive will bring a prepaid envelope for data to support the L/ESS system to
  mail the memory chip back to Mercer Engineering Research Center.
