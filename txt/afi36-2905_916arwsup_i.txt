SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication is updated to reflect changes in guidance and procedures dealing with the AF
Fitness Program. The major changes include the establishment of a Fitness Assessment Cell
(FAC) to centralize and standardize the administration of fitness assessments; Bi-annual testing
requirements for RegAF, AFR, and ANG (Title 10) members; revised component weighting and
scoring based on health-fitness hierarchy; and requirements to score a composite 75 and meet
minimum standards for each component to earn a passing fitness assessment score.

                                  Commander’s Intent:

It is every Airman’s responsibility to maintain the standards set forth in this AFI 365 days
a year. Being physically fit allows you to properly support the Air Force mission. The goal of
the Fitness Program (FP) is to motivate all members to participate in a year-round physical
conditioning program that emphasizes total fitness, to include proper aerobic conditioning,
strength/flexibility training, and healthy eating. Health benefits from an active lifestyle will
increase productivity, optimize health, and decrease absenteeism while maintaining a higher
level of readiness. Commanders and supervisors must incorporate fitness into the AF culture
establishing an environment for members to maintain physical fitness and health to meet
expeditionary mission requirements. The Fitness Assessment (FA) provides commanders with a
tool to assist in the determination of overall fitness of their military personnel. Commander-
driven physical fitness training is the backbone of the AF physical fitness program and an
integral part of mission requirements. The program promotes aerobic and muscular fitness,
flexibility, and optimal body composition of each member in the unit.

                                            Chapter 2

                                   FITNESS ASSESSMENT

2.1. General. The AF uses an overall composite fitness score and minimum scores per
component based on aerobic fitness, body composition, and muscular fitness components to
determine overall fitness. Members must earn a composite score of 75 or greater, and meet the
minimum component scores identified in Attachment 14 (and Attachment 16 if taking the 1-
mile walk test).
Minimum component scores do not constitute the minimum points required to earn a composite
passing score. Scoring the minimum component values in all FA components will not generate
enough points to earn a composite score of 75 or greater. The minimum components are
established to ensure that members test adequately in all components rather than excelling in
some and disregarding others.
Overall fitness is directly related to health risk, including risk of disease and death. Health and
readiness benefits increase as aerobic fitness and body composition and muscular fitness improve
with increases in physical activity.
2.2. Fitness Assessment Components.
   2.2.1. Body composition component.
       2.2.1.1. Evaluated by abdominal circumference (AC) measurements.
   2.2.2. Aerobic component.
       2.2.2.1. Evaluated by the 1.5-mile timed run.
       2.2.2.2. Alternative Aerobic Test: Members not medically cleared to complete the 1.5-
       mile run will be assessed by the 1.0-mile walk as determined by the EP/FPM unless
       otherwise exempted.
   2.2.3. Muscular fitness component.
       2.2.3.1. Evaluated by number of push-ups and sit-ups completed within 1 minute.
2.3. Fitness Assessment Requirements. The FAC will conduct the FA assessment for all
Airmen (RegAF, AFR, and ANG.) NOTE: Where no FAC exists and where feasible, FAs
should be conducted by a certified PTL from another unit. Arrangements of this sort will be
determined by local leadership.
   2.3.1. FAC training and certification will cover official testing procedures and will not be
   deviated from under any circumstances.
   2.3.2. All members must complete the FSQ prior to FA (Attachment 4).
       2.3.2.1. The FSQ should be completed no earlier than 30 calendar days (90 days for
       ARC), but NLT 7 days prior to FA to provide time for medical evaluation, when
       indicated. NOTE: Failure to complete FSQ does not invalidate the FA.
       2.3.2.2. A medical provider must evaluate all members with health issues identified on
       the FSQ prior to the FA. Member must notify the UFPM of the assessment/training
       clearance status from the provider. The provider or ARC MLO completes the bottom
 20                                                AFI36-2905_916ARWSUP_I 5 APRIL 2013


      portion of the FSQ or the Medical Clearance Letter (MCL) if the member has no
      limitations (Attachment 10 or 11) and an AF Form 469, if applicable.
2.4. Assessment Procedures.
   2.4.1. All components of the FA must be completed within a 3-hour window on the same
   day. If extenuating circumstances occur that prevent completion of the test (e.g. rapidly
   changing or severe weather conditions, emergencies, travel time needed to complete other
   components at alternate locations, etc…) then all components must be rescheduled and
   completed at the earliest opportunity, but within 5 duty days. ARC members must be in a
   military duty status for assessments.
      2.4.1.1. Body composition (height, weight, and AC) must be the first component
      assessed in the FA.
      2.4.1.2. The muscular fitness components (push-ups and sit-ups) may be accomplished
      before or after the 1.5-mile run (or 1.0-mile walk).
          2.4.1.2.1. There is a minimum 3-minute rest period between components.
2.5. Body Composition Assessment.
   2.5.1. Height and Weight.
      2.5.1.1. Obtain height and weight IAW DoDI 1308.3. These measurements are not
      factored into the member’s composite score.
   2.5.2. Abdominal Circumference (AC).
      2.5.2.1. The AC measurement is used to obtain the body composition component score.
      The use of AC measurement has been authorized by DoD to meet the body composition
      requirement. See Attachment 9.
2.6. Body Composition Assessment Procedures.
   2.6.1. Height Assessment.
      2.6.1.1. Measurement will be taken in the FAC in conjunction with weight and AC
      measurements. Where a FAC does not exist, Unit CCs may designate a location for body
      composition measurements.
      2.6.1.2. Measurement will be taken with member in PT t-shirt, PT shorts and/or PT
      pants. PT jacket and shoes will not be worn.
      2.6.1.3. Member will stand on a flat surface with the head held horizontal looking
      directly forward, and the chin parallel with the floor. The body should be straight, but
      not rigid, similar to the body position when at attention.
      2.6.1.4. Measurement will be recorded to the nearest half inch.
          2.6.1.4.1. If the height fraction is less than 1/4 inch round down to the nearest half
          inch.
          2.6.1.4.2. If the height fraction is 1/4 inch or greater round up to the nearest half inch.
   2.6.2. Weight Assessment.
AFI36-2905_916ARWSUP_I 5 APRIL 2013                                                            21


      2.6.2.1. The measurement will be made on a scale calibrated IAW TO 33K-1-100-1,

      Codes and Calibration Measurement Summaries, and recorded to the nearest pound with
      the following guidelines.
      2.6.2.2. Measurement will be taken with member in PT t-shirt, PT shorts and/or PT
      pants. PT jacket and shoes will not be worn.
      2.6.2.3. If the weight fraction is less than ½ pound, round down to the nearest pound.
      2.6.2.4. If the weight fraction is ½ pound or greater, round up to the nearest pound.
      2.6.2.5. Two pounds will be subtracted for clothing worn during official FA.
   2.6.3. Abdominal Circumference (AC) Assessment.
      2.6.3.1. FAC or trained designee will take the AC measurement in a private room or in a
      partitioned area. Individuals conducting AC measurements will be of the same gender as
      the member being taped and certified by the EP/FPM as an official taper. Where a FAC
      member of the same gender is not available, an observer of the same gender must be
      present.
      2.6.3.2. Tape measure made of non-stretch (fiberglass) material will be used for the AC.
      2.6.3.3. Member will stand looking straight ahead with arms down to sides.
      2.6.3.4. Tester will stand on the right side of the member.
      2.6.3.5. Measurement will be taken on bare skin.
      2.6.3.6. Tester will locate a horizontal landmark just above the right iliac crest.

Figure 2.1. Measuring Tape Position for Abdominal Circumference.




      2.6.3.7. Tester will place the tape on a horizontal plane around the abdomen at the level
      of the landmark. Ensure the plane of the tape is parallel to the floor and is snug, but does
      not compress the skin. Take the measurement at the end of a normal respiration.

       2.6.3.8. Take the circumference measure three times and record each measurement,
       rounding down to the nearest ½ inch. If any of the measures differ by more than one inch
       from the other two, take an additional measurement. Add the 3 closest measurements,
       divide by 3, and round down to the nearest ½ inch. Record this value as the AC measure.
2.7. Aerobic Fitness Assessment.
   2.7.1. The run and walk will be performed on an approved distance course.
   2.7.2. Aerobic fitness is measured with a 1.5-mile run according to procedures outlined in

   exempted.
   2.7.3. Members medically exempted from the run and cleared for an alternate assessment
   will, upon recommendation by the EP/FPM, complete the 1.0-mile walk, according to
   procedures in Attachment 15. Members performing the 1.0-mile walk will not be allowed to
   run (i.e., at least one foot must be in contact with the ground at all times) or the assessment
   will be terminated.
       2.7.3.1. The 1.0-mile walk is the only authorized alternate assessment for RegAF and
       ARC members. NOTE: The member does not select the assessment method. The
       EP/FPM determines which assessment to use based on the member’s assessment history
       and medical recommendation.

   2.9.4. Exempt. All four components exempted.
2.10. Determining Composite Fitness Score.
   2.10.1. Age and gender-specific fitness score charts are provided in Attachment 14.
   2.10.2. Members will receive a composite score on a 0 to 100 scale based on the following
   maximum component scores: 60 points for aerobic, 20 points for body composition, 10
   points for push-ups and 10 points for sit-ups.
   2.10.3. Determine the score by the following formula:
                  Composite score = Total component points achieved X 100
                                            Total possible points

Component:            Aerobic        Body Composition         Push-ups          Sit-ups
AFI36-2905_916ARWSUP_I 5 APRIL 2013                                                           23


Possible Points:         60                  20                  10              10


   2.10.4. Scoring for exemptions: Members with a DLC prohibiting them from performing
   one or more components of the FA will have a composite score calculated on the assessed
   components. AC will be performed on all members, unless exempted by medical provider
   IAW para 4.2, since there is no risk to the member. Members must achieve a minimum of
   75 adjusted points, based on points available, and meet minimum component standards in
   order to receive a “Satisfactory” rating.
EXAMPLES:
1) Member exempted from push-ups: If member receives 48 points for aerobic fitness, 16 pts
for AC and 8 pts for sit-up component; the total component pts achieved = 72. Possible pts from
aerobic fitness, AC, and sit-up components = 90 pts. Composite score is: (72/90) x 100 = 80 pts.
As long as member meets minimum component scores, member receives a “Satisfactory” rating.
2) Member exempted from aerobic fitness: If member has a 39.5 inch waist and receives 11.7
pts for AC, 9.5 pts for push-ups and 9.5 pts for sit-up component; the total component pts
achieved = 30.7. Possible pts from AC, push-up and sit-up components = 40 points. Composite
score is: (30.7/40) x 100 = 77 points. However, based on minimum component score (because
member did not meet minimum AC requirement of 39.0 inches), member receives an
“Unsatisfactory” rating.
2.11. Scheduling. RegAF, AFR, and ANG (Title 10) members are mandated to complete an
official FA at a minimum of twice yearly. Members must test by the last day of the month, six
calendar months following the previous passing test (e.g., if member tested on 15 April, then
member must retest on/before 31 October of the same year). ANG (Title 32) are mandated to
complete an official FA at a minimum of once yearly. Members must be tested by the last day of
the month, 12 calendar months following the previous test (e.g., if a member tested on 15 April,
the member must retest on/before 30 April of the following year).
   2.11.1. Frequency of the FA should be based on the previous fitness score unless earlier
   assessment is necessary to accommodate deployment.
       2.11.1.1. Excellent/Satisfactory. RegAF, AFR, and ANG (Title 10) members assess by
       the last day of the month, six calendar months following the previous test as outlined
       above. ANG (Title 32) are mandated to complete an official FA at a minimum of once
       yearly and must be tested by the last day of the month, 12 calendar months following the
       previous test.
       2.11.1.2. Unsatisfactory: RegAF, AFR, and ANG (Title 10) members must retest
       within 90 days of a failed official FA. Retesting is not recommended during the first 42
       days after an unsatisfactory test. Recognized medical guidelines provide that this time is
       needed to recondition from Unsatisfactory to Satisfactory status in a manner reducing risk
       of injury. If a member requests, commanders may approve a retest within the 42-day
       window following an Unsatisfactory fitness score. A member wanting to use the full 42-
       day reconditioning period following an Unsatisfactory fitness score will not be required
       to retest during that period. ANG (Title 32) must retest by the last day of the month, 6
       calendar months following the previous Unsatisfactory FA.

   2.11.2. In addition to the mandatory official test, commanders may direct unofficial practice
   tests. This will afford members regular opportunities to assess their compliance with AF
   fitness standards, minimizing any surprise assessment failures at the time of official
   assessments. These assessment scores do not require FAC presence and will not be entered
   into AFFMS; however, they may be used as a commander’s tool to evaluate
   fitness/readiness.
2.12. Currency. Currency is established upon completion of the following program
requirements based on the member’s most recent fitness level as follows:
   2.12.1. Excellent/Satisfactory. To remain current, RegAF, AFR, and ANG (Title 10) must
   be assessed by the last day of the month, six calendar months following the previous passing
   test (e.g., if member tested on 15 Apr, then member must retest on/before 31 Oct of the same
   year and would be non-current on 1 Nov of the same year). ANG (Title 32) must be assessed
   by the last day of the month, 12 months following the previous passing test (e.g., if member
   tested 15 Apr, then member must retest on/before 30 Apr of the next year and would be non-
   current on 1 May of the next year).
   2.12.2. Unsatisfactory. RegAF, AFR, and ANG (Title 10) must retest within 90 days (180
   days for ANG (Title 32)). RegAF, AFR, and ANG AGR members must participate in a unit
   FIP and complete the HLP/HLPR (in person or online) within 10 days of the FA. Non-AGR
   ARC (AFR and ANG) must accomplish HLPR within 60 days of Unsatisfactory FA.
   Members in the Unsatisfactory fitness category will remain in the FIP/SFIP until they
   achieve a Satisfactory or better FA score.
   2.12.3. Waivers. If a member is unable to complete any required portion of the AF Fitness
   Program (e.g., FA, FIP session, intervention classes), the member must receive written
   waiver/approval (Table 4.3) from the Unit CC. A copy of the written approval is filed by the
   UFPM in the member’s fitness records. For ARC members unable to complete any
   scheduled FA, the member must be rescheduled to test on the next date the member is in a
   military duty status and official FAs are being conducted.
   2.12.4. Deployed Location. Members must have a current fitness score on file prior to
   deployment. Member will not be considered "exempt" in the deployed location until their
   current FA expires. If a member fails before deploying and their OPR/EPR closes out after
   the deployment starts, member will be marked "DOES NOT MEET STANDARDS" on the
   OPR/EPR. If they pass, they will be marked "MEETS STANDARDS" on the OPR/EPR.
   The only time "exempt" should be marked is if their current FA "expires" and they are in a
   deployed location where they CANNOT test.
2.13. Recognition for Excellence. Members achieving and maintaining excellent FA scores are
authorized to wear a patch on the right sleeve of their PT uniform shirt (IAW AFI 36-2903,
Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel) recognizing their accomplishment as
follows:
   2.13.1. Current Excellent. Members with a current FA score of ≥ 90 and meeting all
   component minimum requirements.
   2.13.2. Sustained Excellent. Members with the most recent 4 or more tests over a
   continuous minimum 2-year period with FA scores ≥ 90 and meeting all component
   minimum requirements.

                           FITNESS ASSESSMENT WAIVERS

3.1. Installations with Extreme Weather Conditions and/or Higher Altitudes.
   3.1.1. CCs may request a waiver from MAJCOM/CV (or equivalent) to adjust scheduling of
   the 1.5-mile run or 1.0-mile walk assessments for extreme seasonal weather conditions (see
   Attachment 8) if an appropriate indoor facility is not available. The waiver must specify
   periods unable to complete the run/walk assessment safely. Members will still test on
   remaining components and will be granted an exemption from the aerobic component of the
   test. Member’s composite score will be determined in accordance with para 2.10.
   MAJCOM/A1s will forward a copy of approved waivers to AF/A1PP. ARC units will
   forward a copy of approved waivers to AF/A1PP and an additional copy to AF/RE or
   ANG/A1.
   3.1.2. ARC members who commute from a lower altitude to perform duty at their
   assigned/attached unit at a location where the altitude ≥ 5000 feet, may perform FA with an
   AF unit at or near their home altitude, with commander’s approval. The UFPM at the unit of
   assessment will forward a copy of FA results to ARC member’s assigned/attached UFPM for
   AFFMS update and tracking purposes. This variation is only for ARC members who are not
   afforded the 6-week acclimatization period at the assessment site.
AFI36-2905_916ARWSUP_I 5 APRIL 2013                                                               27

                                        EXEMPTIONS

4.1. General. The UFPM retains the FSQ and/or the AF Form 469 and the AF Form 422 in a
folder until a more current FSQ is signed or the AF Form 469 expires. The UFPM notifies FAC
of all exemptions. FAC enters exemptions into AFFMS.
4.2. Exemptions. Exemptions are designed to categorize members as unable or unavailable to
train or assess for a limited time period. Commanders may grant exemptions as outlined in
Table 4.3. Members with a DLC prohibiting them from performing one or more components of
the FA will be assessed on the remaining components and scored IAW para 2.10. All members
will complete an AC assessment as listed in para 4.2.5, unless exempted by medical provider.
Temporary exemptions will not be issued for personnel still currently assigned to a unit solely
for the purpose of improving currency compliance rates (i.e. impending retirements, separations,
etc. where member is not on terminal leave). Members with chronic medical DLCs preventing
them from performing one or more components of the FA will be medically reviewed during the
annual PHA, at a minimum, and referred to the Deployment Availability Working Group for
evaluation as appropriate IAW AFI 10-203. Member may be referred to a medical care provider
or MTF if they have been exempt from the same component for more than two consecutive FAs
to identify the possibility of a chronic medical condition. ARC members are referred to MLO.
   4.2.1. All members who are medically exempt from assessment or for whom fitness training
   must be modified for greater than 30 days, including pregnancy, will be referred to the
   EP/FPM, and if applicable, appropriate ancillary provider (e.g. physical therapist) for an
   exercise assessment, prescription and counseling, or rehabilitation program. ARC members
   (except AGR) will be advised to consult a personal care provider/trainer.
   4.2.2. Providers will list physical limitations on the AF Form 469. When physical
   limitations preclude the member from participating in fitness activities for greater than 30
   days and/or accomplishing the FA, the member will follow local policy to obtain an exercise
   prescription and determination of FA exemption from the EP/FPM. Unless member is given
   a composite exemption, member will continue to prepare for and be assessed on non-exempt
   components of the FA.
       4.2.2.1. A military provider must make the final disposition for any physical limitations
       in cases where military members are seen by non-military providers or when ARC
       members bring recommendations from their PCP. Limitations will be transcribed by an
       AF provider to an AF Form 469 IAW AFI 10-203.
       4.2.2.2. The provider will specify the length of time required for physical limitations.
       4.2.2.3. The expiration date represents the date the member is medically cleared to
       resume physical activities previously restricted. Members will be eligible for FA 42 days
       after the expiration date of physical limitations, as annotated on AF Form 469. This
       allows time for reconditioning, if exempted for greater than 30 days. NOTE: Reference
       4.2.4. for guidelines regarding pregnant members.
       4.2.2.4. For guidance on medications that may affect heart rate measurements for the
       1.0-mile walk, see Attachment 13.

   4.2.3. Pregnancy.
      4.2.3.1. Prenatal counseling will include information on safe physical activity.
      4.2.3.2. Members will be exempted from FA during pregnancy. Members with
      pregnancies lasting 20 weeks or more are also exempt from FA for 180 days after
      completion of pregnancy (delivery, miscarriage, etc.). Pregnancy-related exemptions are
      only for the FA and do not exclude the member from participating in an EP/FPM-
      approved physical fitness program.
      4.2.3.3. AF Form 469 will be reaccomplished by the provider IAW AFI 10-203 in cases
      where pregnancy ends prior to 20 weeks. Providers will take into account physiological
      and psychological changes when determining days required for recovery and
      reconditioning prior to FA eligibility. Exemptions in these cases will not exceed 180
      days.
          4.2.3.3.1. Expiration date will be determined by the provider and represents the date
          the member is medically cleared to begin an unrestricted physical training program.
      4.2.3.4. Pregnant ARC members should discuss their fitness program with their PCP.
   4.2.4. PCS Moves. Exemptions are not granted for members in outbound status. Members
   pending PCS must have a current FA score on file that will not expire prior to the Report-No-
   Later-Than-Date (RNLTD) at the next duty location. If the score expires prior to the
   RNLTD at the next duty location, member must be scheduled for a FA before their departure.
   A member in inbound status is given 42 days from his/her Date Arrive Station (DAS) date to
   acclimatize before assessment.
      4.2.4.1. New Accessions. Airmen will be given 42 days from their DAS to acclimate,
      but will test NLT 6 months from their graduation date from BMT or Commissioning
      Source. DAS may include tech school or their first duty location.
   4.2.5. All members will complete AC assessment unless there is a composite exemption or,
   under rare circumstances, a component exemption determined by the EP/FPM upon
   recommendation by the provider.
   4.2.6. ARC medical unit providers will advise members to consult their PCP for evaluation
   if indicated to recommend specific PT appropriate for medical condition or may refer the
   member to host HLP if available. MTFs can provide space available evaluation as required
   for eligible ARC members.           To obtain an exemption based on evaluation and
   recommendation of PCP, the member must provide the ARC medical unit with medical
   documentation to include diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and period and type of physical
   limitations or restrictions. Individual Reservists (IR) may be referred by the MTF to their
   PCP.
4.3. Exemption Categories.
   4.3.1. Composite Exemptions. Member is exempt from all components of the FA.
   4.3.2. Component Exemption. Member is exempt from one or more components of the FA,
   but will be assessed on remaining components.

                  will still be assessed.
NOTE: Member will not be considered "exempt" in the deployed location until their current FA
expires (Ref Para 2.12). For Officer and Enlisted Evaluation purposes (Ref AFI 36-2406), if a
member fails before deploying and their evaluation closes out after the deployment starts,
member will be marked "DOES NOT MEET STANDARDS" on the EPR/OPR. If they pass,
they will be marked "MEETS STANDARDS" on the EPR/OPR. The only time "exempt" should
be marked is if their current FA "expires" and they are in a deployed location where testing is not
offered and the deployed commander has granted an exemption.

                  PHYSICAL FITNESS EDUCATION/INTERVENTION

5.1. Physical Fitness Education. Physical fitness education will be incorporated into training
programs and unit PT. Ongoing commander emphasis and a supportive environment are
essential to maintain health and fitness of the force.
   5.1.1. To the maximum extent possible, ARC members will attend RegAF host HAWC
   programs at collocated bases. AGR members at non-collocated bases will have the same
   intervention requirements as RegAF Geographically Separated unit (GSU) personnel IAW
   para 6.3. All other reservists will complete online HLPR when RegAF HAWC education
   and intervention programs are not available or accessible.
5.2. Intervention and Support. HLP/HLPR participation is mandatory for all AF members
with an Unsatisfactory score and is available for all members who wish to improve their fitness.
   5.2.1. Members are ultimately responsible for improving their fitness to achieve at minimum
   a Satisfactory score.
   5.2.2. Consistent with mission requirements, commanders and supervisors are encouraged to
   provide 90 minutes, 3-5 times per week of duty time for fitness improvement needs.
   5.2.3. In order for members to achieve improvements in fitness performance, it is
   recommended they exercise a minimum of 5 days per week and follow recommended dietary
   guidelines.
   5.2.4. Members at GSUs, or other locations where HAWCs are not available, may receive
   HLP/HLPR online.
       5.2.4.1. ARC members not in a military duty status will be held accountable for meeting
       fitness standards at reassessment intervals. SFIP is a tool to help members and
       commanders document progress.
5.3. Healthy Living Program (HLP)/Healthy Living Program Reserves (HLPR). This
program targets nutritional and exercise behavior changes necessary to improve one’s health and
fitness. HLP sessions are available to non-AGR ARC members on a space-available basis.
   5.3.1. The core HLP session is mandatory for all RegAF and AGR members with an
   Unsatisfactory score and provides information and tools to support a self-driven fitness
   improvement program. Members must attend within 10 duty days of completion of their
   Unsatisfactory FA. If member is unable to attend within 10 duty days, they must obtain
   written authorization from their unit commander to attend the next available HLP. ARC
   personnel (except AGRs) are required to accomplish HLPR within 60 days of the
   Unsatisfactory FA.
   5.3.2. Additional sessions on a variety of fitness and nutrition topics are available for
   members who want further guidance.
   5.3.3. Members who have consecutive failures are not required to repeat the core HLP
   session, but are encouraged to seek individualized assistance with HLP staff.

                                   SPECIAL POPULATIONS

6.1. Students/Accessions. Commanders, Superintendents, or Commandants of units such as the
USAFA, BMT, Advanced Technical Training Centers, Undergraduate Pilot and Navigator
Training Centers, ROTC, Graduate Medical Education, and Air Force Institute of Technology
(AFIT) education programs will align minimum fitness assessment standards with this
instruction. A FA composite score of ≥ 75 and all component minimums met are required for all
AF members to graduate from or obtain a commission through USAFA, ROTC, OTS, or
Academy of Military Science. Students assigned to civilian institutions (e.g., AFIT) will
participate in FAs conducted by local ROTC detachment, where available, base of servicing
FAC or other arrangements as determined by the assigned CC. Results of FAs will be entered
into the AFFMS by the FAC. Where a FAC does not exist, UFPMs and PTLs will fulfill the role
of the FAC.
   6.1.1. Enlistees failing to meet either: 1) aerobic fitness standards of: 1.5 mile run times of
   18:30 for males, 21:35 for females, or 2) body composition standards of: Maximum
   abdominal circumference of 39.0 inches male, 35.5 inches female or maximum body fat of
   20% for males, 28% for females upon arrival at BMT are deemed medically unable to safely
   rehabilitate to a passing FA score within the standard 42-day rehabilitation period. They may
   be immediately processed for entry level separation pursuant to AFI 36-3208, Administrative
   Separation of Airmen, para 5.22.
6.2. Geographically Separated Units (GSUs)/Individuals.
   6.2.1. Members will complete all components of the FA.
       6.2.1.1. If FAC staff are not available, UFPM and/or PTL will fulfill the roles of the
       FAC. Alternatively, members will work with their unit CC to accomplish the FA at an
       alternate location where a FAC is available. Unit TDY funds may be used if necessary.
       A commander may coordinate with host-base EP to train and certify PTLs to conduct
       FAs locally when travel is not appropriate.
       6.2.1.2. The host base will provide fitness program support.
       6.2.1.3. For AFRC GSUs the Numbered Air Force Fitness Program Manager (NFPM)
       and supporting FSS units will provide support to UFPMs and commanders. HQ AFRC
       program manager will support UFPMs at DRUs that report directly to AFRC; the NFPM
       will support UFPMs at DRUs that report directly to a Numbered Air Force.
       6.2.1.4. In unique circumstances (e.g., only one AF member at a location), the unit CC
       may authorize a non-AF person to conduct FAs. This individual must be certified to
       conduct the FA. A commander may coordinate with the nearest AF base EP to train and
       certify non-AF personnel to become a PTL. Results of the FA will be entered in the
       AFFMS by FAC personnel at the parent organization.
6.3. Individual Reservists (IR).
   6.3.1. The attached/assigned RegAF unit is responsible for management of the FP for IRs.

  6.3.2. Program managers and Base Individual Mobilization Augmentee Administrator
  (BIMAA) will monitor the timely completion of FP requirements with the attached/assigned
  RegAF unit and the IR, and will provide FA expiration dates if not accessible by the
  attached/assigned RegAF unit.
  6.3.3. Members will be assessed by the attached/assigned RegAF unit during the member’s
  AT, if possible, or during an Inactive Duty Training (IDT) period. Members will contact the
  RegAF UFPM to schedule the FA.
  6.3.4. Members must be in a military duty status during assessment.
  6.3.5. ARC members may not apply personal physical fitness activities for the purpose of
  obtaining participation credit for AT, UTA, IDT, or additional training periods.
  6.3.6. All PIRR members in the Civil Air Patrol United States Air Force (CAP-USAF) and
  Air Liaison Officer (ALO) programs are authorized to perform the FA only once per year.

                               PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

7.1. Fitness Program Software Application.
   7.1.1. The Air Force Fitness Management System (AFFMS) software application is
   accessible through the AF Portal.
   7.1.2. Specific privileges to enter data, view, retrieve and print reports, conduct audits, and
   correct data entries are granted by FAC personnel according to roles and responsibilities for
   FP data management.
7.2. Fitness Program Case Files.
   7.2.1. The FAC creates a FP case file when a member scores Unsatisfactory on a FA.
   UFPM maintains an active file in the member’s fitness record for 24 months. For locations
   where no FAC exists, the UFPM will initiate the FP case file.
   7.2.2. The UFPM maintains and files any pertinent documents in the FP case file. See
   Attachment 10 (RegAF) and Attachment 11 (ARC) Sample Memorandum for Medical
   Clearance and Attachment 12, Sample Memorandum for Temporary Duty
   Assignment/Professional Military Education (TDY/PME).
      7.2.2.1. (Added-916ARW) Member will fill out a Fitness Questionnaire stating whether
      they are willing and able to complete their FA. If member has certain risk factors that
      will not allow them to do their FA then another letter will be provided for them to take to
      their civilian provider to be returned to 916 AMDS for processing. This form is
      referenced in AFI 36-2905 Attachment 11, and the form to be used by the 916 ARW is
      attached hereto.
   7.2.3. The UFPM who is responsible for monitoring attached/assigned reservists will
   maintain the FP case file.
7.3. Protected Health Information.
   7.3.1. FA, including run times and VO2 scores (for 1-mile walk assessment), push-ups, sit-
   ups, and AC component/composite scores do not meet the definition of protected health
   information (PHI) as outlined in DoD 6025.18R, DoD Health Information Privacy
   Regulation.
   7.3.2. Any occasion where a member interacts with a PCP, EP, or medical technician for
   education, intervention, assessment, or treatment related to the FP, the information generated
   as a result of the interaction is PHI and must be handled IAW DoDI 6025.18R and MTF local
   procedures.
      7.3.2.1. If PHI must be shared with the CC, an accounting of the specific information
      released must occur as outlined in DoDI 6025.18R and in local MTF policy unless the
      member provides written authorization to disclose the information.

                                           Chapter 9

                    ADMINISTRATIVE AND PERSONNEL ACTIONS

9.1. Adverse Personnel Actions (for Unsatisfactory Fitness Members). Members are
expected to be in compliance with Air Force fitness standards at all times. When members fail to
comply with those standards (receive an Unsatisfactory FA score), they render themselves
potentially subject to adverse action. Commanders should consult with their servicing Staff
Judge Advocate before taking such action.
   9.1.1. Prohibited Actions:
       9.1.1.1. Commanders may not impose nonjudicial punishment (Article 15, UCMJ) solely
       for failing to achieve a Satisfactory fitness score.
       9.1.1.2. Upon receipt of a Medical Evaluation Board (MEB) permanent exemption, a
       member is not subject to adverse personnel action for inability to take the FA.
       9.1.1.3. While units may perform unofficial practice tests for diagnostic purposes,
       commanders will refrain from taking adverse action based solely on the results of these
       tests. The ultimate goal of the fitness program is to motivate members to adopt a lifestyle
       of fitness through realization of positive health-benefits from regular exercise and good
       nutrition. Members are more likely to embrace and positively view unit practice testing
       when conducted in the spirit of camaraderie rather than potential penalization.
   9.1.2. Unit CCs may take adverse administrative action upon a member’s Unsatisfactory
   fitness score on an official FA (see Attachment 19). For administrative separation criteria,
   see para 9.1.5. below.
       9.1.2.1. If adverse administrative action is not taken in response to an Unsatisfactory
       fitness score on an official FA, unit CCs will document in the member’s fitness case file
       as to why no action is being taken. The lack of such CC documentation does not discount
       the testing failure as a basis in support of administrative discharge action pursuant to
       para 9.1.5.
   9.1.3. As appropriate, unit CCs will document and take corrective action for members’
   unexcused failures to participate in the FP such as failing to accomplish a scheduled FA,
   failing to attend a scheduled fitness appointment, failing to complete mandatory educational
   intervention or failing to maintain the required documentation of exercise while on the FIP.
   9.1.4. For standards and requirements relating to performance report documentation of
   fitness, consult AFI 36-2406, Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems, and other official
   guidance specifically addressing performance reports.
   9.1.5. Administrative Separation. (See AFI 36-3208 for active duty enlisted members, AFI
   36-3206, Administrative Discharge Procedures for Commissioned Officers, for active duty
   officers, AFI 36-3209, Separation and Retirement Procedures for Air National Guard and
   Air Force Reserve Members, for all ARC members.)
       9.1.5.1. A unit CC may initiate (enlisted members) or recommend (officers)
       administrative discharge of a member when:
AFI36-2905_916ARWSUP_I 5 APRIL 2013                                                          39


        9.1.5.1.1. The member has received an Unsatisfactory FA score following a
        conditioning period of at least 42 days after a previous Unsatisfactory FA score, i.e.
        the member has accrued the second of two consecutive Unsatisfactory FA scores; and
        9.1.5.1.2. The CC finds that the member failed to demonstrate significant
        improvement (as determined by the CC) despite the conditioning period; and
        9.1.5.1.3. Evaluation by a military health care provider (e.g., a physician, physician’s
        assistant or nurse practitioner) has ruled out medical conditions precluding the
        member from achieving a passing score.
     9.1.5.2. Unit CCs shall make a discharge or retention recommendation to the Installation
     CC (or special/general court-martial convening authority in the member’s chain of
     command) when an individual remains in the Unsatisfactory fitness category for a
     continuous 12-month period or receives four Unsatisfactory FA scores in a 24-month
     period. Prior to initiation of discharge action, a military medical provider must have
     ruled out medical conditions precluding the member from achieving a passing score.
        9.1.5.2.1. If unit CC recommends retention, recommendation may be made by
        informal memorandum for Installation CC endorsement. Concurring endorsement by
        Installation CC neither removes nor discounts prior or future FA failures from serving
        as potential bases for discharge (a failing FA score, to include one under a prior
        version of this instruction, remains a valid basis for discharge so long as it is within
        24 months of the member’s most recent FA failure). An Installation CC approving a
        member’s continued retention need not re-visit this decision in the event of future FA
        failures by the member. Unit CCs remain obligated in response to such future
        failures, to either take adverse administrative action or document in the member’s
        fitness case file why no such action is being taken. See para 9.1.2.1. File retention
        decision memorandum in member’s fitness records. If Installation CC disagrees with
        Unit CC retention recommendation, Installation CC initiates discharge action
        pursuant to applicable discharge instruction.
        9.1.5.2.2. If unit CC recommends discharge, unit CC initiates (enlisted members) or
        recommends (officers) discharge action pursuant to applicable discharge instruction.
        9.1.5.2.3. For ARC members (except AGR), the Unit CC shall consider
        administrative separation if a member remains in an Unsatisfactory fitness category
        for a continuous 24-month period. A decision to retain the member does not remove
        or discount previous FA Unsatisfactory assessments. The decision may serve as
        potential basis for future discharge actions if member retests and continues to remain
        in an Unsatisfactory category (so long as it is within 24 months of the member’s most
        recent FA failure). While a commander approving a member’s continued retention
        need not re-visit this decision in the event of future FA failures by the member, Unit
        CCs remain obligated in response to such future failures, to either take adverse
        administrative action or document in the member’s fitness case file why no such
        action is being taken. See para 9.1.2.1. The unit of attached/assigned CC may
        initiate reassignment of individual reservists after the second Unsatisfactory FA. The
        member may be reassigned to the inactive reserve, either Non-Affiliated Reserve
        Section (NSRS)-NB if obligated, or NARS-NA if non-obligated. Members will be
        reassigned according to AFI 36-2115, Assignments within the Reserve Components.
 40                                              AFI36-2905_916ARWSUP_I 5 APRIL 2013


9.2. Failing to Present a Professional Military Image While in Uniform.
   9.2.1. CCs must ensure members present a professional military image while in uniform. A
   professional military image/appearance may or may not directly relate to an individual’s
   fitness level or weight.
   9.2.2. Commanders may require individuals who do not present a professional military
   appearance (regardless of overall FA composite score) to enter the FIP (SFIP for ARC)
   and/or otherwise schedule individuals for fitness education and intervention. Commanders
   taking such action:
      9.2.2.1. Specify in writing, using AF Form 108, the date an individual should complete
      the program and the requirements they must meet.
      9.2.2.2. May extend the exercise program in writing beyond the initial period until the
      participant achieves a professional military appearance.
      9.2.2.3. May take administrative and/or personnel action if the individual fails to
      participate or comply with the requirements established by the CC.
9.3. Education and Training Programs.
   9.3.1. This instruction does not set eligibility standards for attending PME or other training
   programs. For those standards consult the applicable governing regulations. In those
   situations where members with Unsatisfactory FA scores are permitted to attend training, the
   following rules apply:
      9.3.1.1. Members enrolled in the FIP/SFIP must continue with this program and
      scheduled FAs while in training status.
      9.3.1.2. Commanders sending members enrolled in the FIP to a training TDY that
      exceeds 6 weeks must send the gaining commander or equivalent a memorandum
      explaining the required intervention, follow-up, and testing (Attachment 12) at least 2
      weeks prior to TDY.
      9.3.1.3. The gaining commander or commandant at the TDY location will assume unit
      CC responsibilities for FP purposes.
      9.3.1.4. ARC members in all fitness categories going on active duty orders for training
      must be prepared to participate in PT programs and those in the SFIP must participate in
      the FIP during periods of active duty.
9.4. AF Form 108, Physical Fitness Education and Intervention Processing.
   9.4.1. Unit CC or equivalent will use the AF Form 108 as a tool to document mandatory
   education and intervention requirements.          The failure of command or command
   representatives to sign, annotate, or otherwise complete the AF Form 108 in no way lessens
   the member’s overarching responsibility for his/her own fitness and compliance with AF
   fitness standards.
      9.4.1.1. Barnes Center for Enlisted Education Senior Enlisted Leader and NCOs assigned
      duty as Detachment Chief or Academy Commandant have signature authority for the AF
      Form 108.
AFI36-2905_916ARWSUP_I 5 APRIL 2013                                                         41


   9.4.2. UFPMs initiate and annotate mandatory appointments on AF Form 108 to include
   date/time and location.
   9.4.3. Member will sign the AF Form 108 to acknowledge HLP/HLPR enrollment.
   9.4.4. Respective program facilitator signs the AF Form 108 upon completion of the
   education/intervention program.
   9.4.5. Medical provider will sign AF Form 108 if member is referred for medical evaluation
   following an Unsatisfactory score. Members with Unsatisfactory scores may be scheduled
   for a medical evaluation to determine if there are possible medical indicators that prohibit
   program success.
   9.4.6. If a member fails to show for any assigned appointments, the FAC and/or
   HAWC/medical staff will notify the member’s UFPM who, in turn, will notify the CC for
   appropriate action.
9.5. Forms Prescribed. AF Form 108, Physical Fitness Education and Intervention Processing;
AF Form 422, Physical Profile Serial Report; AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; AF Form 469, Duty Limiting Condition Report; AF Form 418, Selective
Reenlistment Program Consideration.
   9.5.1. The failure of command or command representatives to sign, annotate, or otherwise
   complete the AF Form 108 or other prescribed forms in no way lessen the member’s
   overarching responsibility for his/her own fitness and compliance with AF fitness standards.

9.6. Adopted Forms.

No forms adopted for this instruction.

                            PHYSICAL FITNESS GUIDELINES

A2.1. Physical Fitness. The health and care of the body through physical activity. The health-
related components of fitness are: cardiorespiratory endurance, body composition, muscular
strength, muscular endurance, and flexibility-mobility-stability.        Each component is a
movement-related trait or capacity that is generally independent of the others. An underlying
concept here is better status in each of the constituent components is associated with lower risk
for development of disease or functional disability. The skill-related components of fitness are:
agility, balance, coordination, power, reaction time, and speed. These components are more
genetically dependent than the health-related components and play a role in some AF specialties
(occupation-specific).
A2.2. Goal. The fundamental goal of a physical fitness program is to bring about a change in
personal health and fitness behavior, which includes, at a minimum, habitual physical activity.
This regular physical activity should result in long-term exercise compliance and attainment of
individual fitness goals and objectives.
A2.3. Objective. The basic objectives of an exercise program are: 1) to gain health benefits
and prevent hypokinetic (inactivity) disorders, or 2) seek to attain greater health benefits and
higher levels of fitness beyond basic health by engaging in physical activity of more vigorous
intensity or of greater volume (longer duration and greater frequency). Daily physical activity is
essential to improve health and quality of life, and maintain functional capacity. Health benefits
are proportional to both the volume and intensity of activity--thus, every increase adds some
benefit. To meet either of the above objectives one must execute a balanced exercise program.
Recommendations from the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), the American Heart
Association (AHA), and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are
included in the exercise guidelines below.
A2.4. Aerobic Fitness. Synonymous with cardiorespiratory endurance, it is the ability to
perform large muscle, dynamic, moderate-to-high intensity exercise for prolonged periods.
Performance of such exercise depends on the functional state of the respiratory, cardiovascular,
and skeletal muscle systems. More simply defined as the ability to produce energy. Your level
of aerobic fitness determines how long and how hard you can exercise.
   A2.4.1. Mode or Type of Activity. Improvements in aerobic fitness occur when the activity,
   at the proper frequency, duration and intensity, involves a large proportion of total muscle
   mass, maximizes use of large muscles, (e.g., muscles around the thigh and hip), involves
   dynamic, rhythmic muscle contractions, and minimizes static (no movement) contraction and
   use of small muscles. Many modes of activity meet these requirements, to include cross-
   country (Nordic) skiing, running, cycling, swimming, skating, rowing, walking, aerobic
   dance, indoor aerobic exercise machines, and some sports if they are continuous in nature
   (soccer, basketball, court sports).
   A2.4.2. Frequency, Duration, and Intensity. Accomplish moderately intense aerobic activity
   30 minutes a day, five days a week or vigorously intense aerobic activity 20 minutes to 25
   minutes a day, 3 days a week and muscle fitness exercise (see below), or an equivalent
   combination of moderately and vigorously intense aerobic activity. For additional and more
   extensive health and fitness benefits, accomplish moderately intense aerobic activity 300
AFI36-2905_916ARWSUP_I 5 APRIL 2013                                                               49


   minutes (5 hours) a week, or accomplish vigorously intense aerobic activity 150 minutes a
   week, or an equivalent combination of moderately and vigorously intense aerobic activity.
   Generally, the minimal levels of exercise volume and intensity above are necessary to
   maintain health and fitness, while the higher levels are necessary to improve health and
   fitness.
   A2.4.3. Intensity Determination. Moderately intense aerobic activity equates to continuous
   exercise that raises heart and respiratory rates, initiates sweating (varies with climate), and
   permits conversation; vigorously intense aerobic activity elicits higher physiological
   responses and permits light or broken conversation.
       A2.4.3.1. Heart Rate Calculations. Exercise intensity may be measured objectively via
       heart rate (HR) formulas.
           A2.4.3.1.1. Maximal HR Formula. Aerobic activity corresponding to HRs in the
           range of 60% - 90% of age specific estimated maximal HR (220 – age in years).
           A2.4.3.1.2. HR Range or HR Reserve Formula – steps are:
1. Calculate Maximal HR by subtracting age in years from 220. Max HR = 220 – age.
2. Measure Resting HR for three to four days shortly after waking for a 60 second period, while
   in the same body position each day. Take an average of the measures.
3. Calculate HR Range. HR Range = Maximal HR – Resting HR.
4. Calculate minimum, optimal (target), and do-not-exceed (safety) exercise HRs:
   - Minimum exercise HR = (50% HR Range) + Resting HR
   - Optimal exercise HR = (75% HR Range) + Resting HR
   - Do-not-exceed exercise HR = (85% HR Range) + Resting HR
For example, a 30 year old AF member with a Resting HR of 70 beats/min calculates Maximal
HR as 220 – 30 = 190 beats/min and HR Range as 190 – 70 = 120. Applying the equations:
   - Minimum exercise HR =       50% (120) + 70 = 60 + 70 = 130 beats/min
   - Optimal exercise HR =       75% (120) + 70 = 90 + 70 = 160 beats/min
   - Do-not-exceed exercise HR = 85% (120) + 70 = 102 + 70 = 172 beats/min
Therefore, this individual should keep exercise HR above 130 beats/min, but below 172
beats/min, targeting 160 beats/min for at least 20 minutes to 25 minutes 3 days/week. Unfit
individuals should start at the lower end of the HR Range. As fitness level increases, the resting
HR will decrease, therefore increase the intensity percentage from low (50%) towards optimal
(75%). Also, base fitness personnel can help fine tune these calculations taking into account
medications, risk of injury, and individual preferences and objectives.
   A2.4.4. Rate of Progression. A physiological conditioning or training effect will occur at the
   onset of an exercise program, especially for individuals with low initial fitness levels.
   Adjustments in mode, frequency, duration and intensity may be necessary to reach higher
   levels of health and fitness. Patience and perseverance are critical to maintain an active
   lifestyle and effective exercise program because many will start a physical activity program,
   but within the first two or three weeks of starting, quit and return to an inactive lifestyle. One
   must maintain regular activity for at least three or four weeks before tangible and lasting
   health improvements, including body fat loss, will occur. To help ensure that increases in
 50                                               AFI36-2905_916ARWSUP_I 5 APRIL 2013


    frequency, duration, and especially intensity of activity occur in a gradual fashion, the
    following stages of progression are helpful to avoid injury, illness, and potential
    discouragement.
Initial Stage
- Include low-level aerobic activities and light muscular endurance exercises for minimal muscle
 soreness or discomfort. Do not be aggressive in this stage.
- Set individual goals which are achievable and realistic; include a system of personal rewards.
- Majority of failures occur in this stage – persevere to experience benefits.
Improvement Stage
- Progress more rapidly here at a higher intensity, steadily increase duration to 45 minutes of
continuous exercise. Increase frequency as adaptation to exercise permits.
Maintenance Stage
- After six months of regular activity, focus on maintenance. Review goals ensuring that long-
term focus is on a lifestyle approach to activity, remembering that considerable health benefits
come from regular participation in moderate exercise.

A2.5. Muscular Fitness. A linked term for muscular strength, the maximum force generated by
a specific muscle or muscle group, and muscular endurance, the ability of a muscle group to
execute repeated contractions over a period of sufficient time duration to cause muscular fatigue.
A balanced physical activity program should address the five health-related components of
physical fitness, with primary emphasis on aerobic fitness, but muscular fitness is also important
as inclusion of muscular fitness exercise provides several benefits:
- Develops muscular strength and endurance to enhance the ability to live a physically
 independent lifestyle, i.e., improves daily functional living
- Increases and maintains fat-free (lean) mass, helping to maintain resting metabolic rate, which
 is beneficial for preventing fat gain
- Increases the strength and integrity of connective tissue
- Increases bone mineral density, preventing age-related bone deterioration
AFI36-2905_916ARWSUP_I 5 APRIL 2013                                                               51


- Combats chronic low back problems
- Improves the ability of the muscles to recover from physical activity
- Provides injury protection during deployment, daily work, and sports and recreational activities
- Alleviates some common musculoskeletal complaints which result in lost duty time and
 medical treatment costs
- May provide modest gains in cardiorespiratory fitness
- May improve mood and self-image
   A2.5.1. Overload, Mode, and Pattern. Development of muscular strength and muscular
   endurance occurs by placing an overload on a muscle or muscle groups. Through adaptation
   the muscles become stronger or better able to sustain muscular activity. This process of
   overloading the muscular system is referred to as resistance training which includes, but is
   not limited to calisthenics, weight training, and field exercises. This training should focus
   not only on the core, lower and upper regions of the body, but also on primary movement
   patterns (in priority order) of run, bend, twist, squat, pull, push. Resistance training should
   also be individualized, i.e., specifically designed to meet one’s needs, and progressive in
   nature by including periodic increases in workload as muscular fitness improves;
   physiological adaptations to properly executed resistance training include both
   neuromuscular adaptations (occurs in the first several weeks of a muscle fitness program)
   and muscle cell adaptations (occurs later).
   A2.5.2. Volume and Intensity. ACSM, AHA, and CDC recommend accomplishing 8 to 10
   resistance training exercises involving all major muscle groups, at least twice per week.
   They recommend one set of 8 to 12 repetitions of each exercise performed at moderate or
   high intensity to muscular fatigue. Multiple-set regimens may provide greater benefits as
   time permits.
   A2.5.3. Procedures and Safety. The following resistance training procedures work in
   conjunction with the above recommendations for general fitness:
Control - Training activities should be rhythmic, performed at a controlled speed, and not
interfere with normal breathing.
Order of Execution – Do not work the same muscle group with consecutive exercises. Rather,
work the major areas of the body at one time, i.e., core, lower, then upper, etc., with occasional
mixing of exercises within major areas to maintain variety and prevent staleness in the workout
routine. Also, start with exercises of greatest priority and follow with exercises of lesser
importance.
Range of Motion (ROM) – Conduct exercises over the joint’s full ROM in a controlled manner,
however, limit the ROM on leg extensions (approximately 20 degrees to approximately 60
degrees of motion) to protect the knee joint.
Rest Time - Keep rest time between exercises (and between sets if use multiple sets) as brief as
possible, approximately one-to-one or one-to-two work: rest ratio for strength, shorter rest for
endurance, and longer rest and higher resistance for power. Avoid long, time wasting breaks
which results in better fitness, a more efficient workout, and increases the likelihood for retaining
resistance training as a lifestyle behavior.
Safety - Perform a proper warm-up, work antagonistic (opposite) muscle groups, and use a
spotter if using free weights.

   A2.5.4. Calisthenic Specific Training. Calisthenics are body resistance exercises to improve
   muscular fitness, e.g., sit-ups, push-ups, and pull-ups. One of several means of physical
   training with these and other callisthenic exercises is a basic set procedure that provides a
   fairly objective means for controlling an individual exercise prescription. The goal of this
   procedure is to accomplish 33% of a one test (one set) maximum in a three set pattern on a
   controlled one minute cycle. First, determine the current maximum number of repetitions of
   the exercise in a one minute period (i.e., use the most current AF Fitness Assessment result).
   Secondly, take 33% of that total number for the amount of repetitions to perform for each of
   the three sets. Rest between sets is on the minute cycle, i.e., perform the first set of
   repetitions, rest for the remainder of one minute, then start the next set at the 60 second
   cumulative time mark, and start the third set at the cumulative 120 second mark. Perform the
   three sets of exercise once per day starting at two to three days per week building to a
   maximum of six days per week. For example, an individual with a sit-up test maximum of
   44 repetitions will perform three sets of 15 repetitions per set on the minute cycle: 15
   repetitions – rest remainder of the first minute, 15 repetitions – rest remainder of second
   minute, 15 repetitions. Over time add repetitions to each set as the last few repetitions of the
   third set become easier.
A2.6. Flexibility. The maximum ability to move a joint freely, without pain, through a range of
motion. Flexibility tends to decrease with age, primarily due to the decrease in activity
associated with age. Although flexibility is not assessed during the AF Fitness Assessment, no
single test can be generalized to evaluate total body flexibility, it is important to health and
functional living and should be part of a well balanced physical activity routine.
   A2.6.1. Timing and Guidelines. Despite the popular perception that stretching prior to
   exercise enhances performance and prevents injury, little scientific evidence exists to support
   such long-held beliefs. Rather, engage in a gradual, activity-specific warm-up that includes
   the movement patterns of planned activity, e.g., if running for the workout then warm-up
   with brisk walking, jogging, and dynamic movements or drills such as leg swings and knee
   raises. To help maintain flexibility one should stretch after a workout when muscles,
   tendons, ligaments and connective tissue are warmer (above normal body temperature).
   Static stretch according to the following ACSM guidelines:
 Type: static stretch, with a major emphasis on the major muscle groups to include the low
 back, hips, quadriceps and hamstrings (front and back of thigh), lower leg. Do not ballistic
 (bounce) stretch.
 Frequency: two to three days per week
 Duration: 10 to 30 seconds for each stretch
 Intensity: to a position of mild discomfort, not to point of pain
 Repetitions: three to four for each stretch
Again, first increase body temperature, don’t “cold” stretch. Finally, avoid comparing one’s
level of flexibility to others as it varies widely across individuals due to several factors that
include gender, age, activity level, temperature, and extensibility of the muscles and tendons
surrounding the joints.
AFI36-2905_916ARWSUP_I 5 APRIL 2013                                                                 53


    A2.6.2. Warm-up and Cool-down. Although frequently ignored, these activities before and
    after an exercise session are important. Warm-up should be conducted as above (activity
    specific movements and dynamic drills) and always precede physical activity to increase
    body temperature and blood flow and to guard against muscle, tendon and ligament strains
    and tears. Cool-down, as important as the warm-up, is a gradual reduction in activity to
    prevent blood pooling, hasten recovery and avoid injury.
    A2.6.3. Stability and Mobility. These are terms recently combined with flexibility in this
    final health-related component to designate a broader term that encompasses the role of
    stability and mobility in posture, occupational functional movement, and daily functional
    living. Stability deals with maintaining non-movement functional positions, including
    postural stability. Stability ranges from shoulder to ankle with shoulder, core and hip
    stability as primary. Mobility, similar to stability, is stable, controlled, functional movement
    through an active range of motion in the various planes of motion.
A2.7. General Workout Session. The salient phases of a recommended general workout
session address the above components in the following order:
Movement Preparatory Phase (Warm-Up)
- Body temperature increase via activity specific warm-up
- Dynamic activity drills
Cardiorespiratory Endurance (Aerobic) Phase
- Aerobic activity such as cross-country skiing, running, cycling, swimming, skating, rowing,
 walking, aerobic dance, indoor aerobic exercise machines (e.g., cycle ergometer, elliptical, rower,
 versa climber, stair), and some sports if they are continuous in nature
Muscle Fitness Phase
- Resistance training such as calisthenics, weight/object training (e.g., machines, free weights,
 medicine balls, kettle bells, bands, cables, ropes), plyometrics, and field exercises
- Movement Patterns – run, bend, twist, squat, pull, push
- Body Regions – core, lower, whole body, upper
- Stability and Mobility/Functional Movement
Combined Activity Phase
- Combined aerobic and muscular fitness actions, e.g., rotations, or running between muscle fitness
stations
Skill Phase
- Occupational or sport specific skill development/practice as desired
Movement Transition/Cessation Phase (Cool-Down)
- Activity specific cool-down
- Flexibility - static stretching
A2.8. Body Composition. Relative portion of the body comprised of fat and fat-free tissue.
Body weight and body fat are related to health status, but misconceptions exist regarding body
measurements and application of results. In the prevention of fat gain and associated diseases
the focus must go beyond body weight measures to relative body fat, and body fat distribution.
 54                                                AFI36-2905_916ARWSUP_I 5 APRIL 2013


   A2.8.1. Weight and Height. Measurements of weight and weight relative to height (scale
   readings, height-weight tables, BMI) do not differentiate between fat and fat-free tissue, and
   do not account for fat distribution pattern.
   A2.8.2. Relative Body Fat and Body Fat Distribution. The amount of total body tissue that
   is fat and where fat is deposited or carried on the body is necessary to complete a body
   composition assessment. This is done via “non-scale” measurements.
       A2.8.2.1. Percent Body Fat. Total body fat relative to body mass is known as percent
       body fat. Average and at risk levels are 15% and 25% for males, 23% and 32% for
       females, respectively.
       A2.8.2.2. Abdominal Circumference. Increased health risks associated with overfat are
       not only related to total body fat, but also and more closely to fat distribution. Upper
       body or trunk fat, specifically abdominal fat, presents the greatest health risk; it is highly
       linked to cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders such as type II diabetes.
       Reducing abdominal girth or circumference is more important than normalizing body
       weight since exercise induced increases in muscle mass can mask reductions in girth, i.e.,
       with proper exercise body weight may stay the same or even increase, but “belt size” will
       reduce. Therefore, as abdominal fat is an independent risk factor for disease, the
       evaluation of AC is used. A high risk of current and future disease exists for males with
       an AC > 39 inches and for females with an AC > 35.5 inches regardless of age or height.
       The health risk is moderate for males with an AC > 35 inches and for females with an AC
       > 31.5 inches.
NOTE: The above guidelines are recommendations for a member to increase or maintain
fitness. EP/FPMs will determine whether adjustments in mode, intensity, duration, frequency or
repetitions are required based on the member’s exercise regimen, characteristics, and FA scores
to improve fitness. Members who are over age 35 years and are sedentary and members who are
initiating a fitness program should contact their fitness center or HAWC for assistance in
developing an exercise routine. Members who are over age 35 years and are sedentary should
also consider contact their medical care provider prior to initiating physical activity. ARC
members can consult HAWCs and fitness center trainers where available. Members are highly
encouraged to seek professional advice from personal fitness trainers, FCs, or HAWCs for assis-
tance in establishing or adjusting their personal fitness program.

                   SAMPLE UNIT PHYSICAL FITNESS PROGRAMS

A3.1. Ability-based training/fitness screening.
   A3.1.1. Commanders should use trained PTLs to establish unit programs that allow members
   to participate at their current fitness level and progress gradually. A safe conditioning
   program encourages and supports members training at their own pace.
       A3.1.1.1. PTLs consult the EP/FPM to assist with development of ability-based training
       programs.
   A3.1.2. Commanders opting to implement maximal exertion activities (e.g. practice timed
   assessments), should require personnel to complete a FSQ (Attachment 4).
A3.2. Considerations to be made prior to beginning the unit physical fitness event:
   A3.2.1. Safety/environmental conditions.
   A3.2.2. Acclimatization: individuals who have recently PCS’d may require a 6-week period
   of acclimatization to local environmental conditions.
   A3.2.3. Fluids/hydration: must be available during the exercise event/activity.
   A3.2.4. Emergencies/injuries: establish emergency procedures to include availability of a
   cell phone, emergency responder contact information, BLS-trained members, and first aid
   kit.
   A3.2.5. Safety: reflective vests, appointment of safety monitors/cross guards, and
   cones/signs on course as appropriate.
   A3.2.6. Unit Physical Fitness Programs must follow guidelines as specified in Attachment
   2.
       A3.2.6.1. Individual abilities should be considered so that all members are provided a
       workout that is within their current fitness status.
   A3.2.7. Warm-up and cool-down periods should be accomplished with each unit physical
   fitness event.
A3.3. PTL-developed, ability-based Unit Physical Training Programs.
   A3.3.1. Ability runs. Prior to the unit exercise session, divide the unit into groups based
   upon the members’ running paces.
       A3.3.1.1. A leader capable of maintaining the assigned pace for the group should be
       assigned to each group to monitor for safety/injuries of group members.
       A3.3.1.2. For safety purposes, prior to the exercise session, determine the
       distance/course to be covered and/or the time in which to run and mark the course to alert
       others of group PT.
       A3.3.1.3. As a variation, the unit may run together for a specified short duration (at a
       pace that can be achieved by all participants) and then divide into the assigned ability
       groups for the remainder of the event.
 56                                                AFI36-2905_916ARWSUP_I 5 APRIL 2013


       A3.3.1.4. As members’ fitness levels increase, they should be placed in faster running
       groups.
       A3.3.1.5. Discourage formation running and cadence calls while running. Doing so may
       place member at risk for injury for the shortest and tallest individuals since cadence
       calling forces all to move at the speed and stride length of the caller. Running is more
       efficient when each member can run at his/her own stride frequency and stride length. If
       desired, cadence calls should be used for short-distance foot marches only.
   A3.3.2. Multi-station training courses (e.g., obstacle courses, par courses, and circuit
   training).
       A3.3.2.1. Prior to using course, discuss safety and fitness concepts of course with the
       EP/FPM.
       A3.3.2.2. Consider individual abilities by permitting members to progress through
       course at their own speed. Those members who complete course in faster times should
       be encouraged to complete additional components of course a second time until all
       members are through the course at least once.
       A3.3.2.3. Multi-station training can be accomplished at base fitness facilities using
       exercise/fitness equipment or at a designated outdoor area performing activities of both
       cardiovascular and muscular fitness.
          A3.3.2.3.1. Coordinate with fitness facilities in order to conduct multi-station
          training sessions at times conducive to unit, as well as, fitness facility.
          A3.3.2.3.2. Coordinate with EP/FPM to obtain multi-station training programs
          appropriate to the fitness site.
   A3.3.3. Fitness facilities/existing fitness programs/classes.
       A3.3.3.1. Coordinate with fitness facilities for group PT exercise sessions and fitness
       classes.
       A3.3.3.2. Individual members should complete continuous aerobic exercise of their
       choice (e.g. treadmill, rower, stair-climber, cross trainers, bicycles, swimming and
       spinning classes). Recommend 25-45 minutes in duration.
A3.4. Prevention of Injury and Illness.
   A3.4.1. Safety must be an overarching concern throughout all physical training. Consider
   individual safety issues such as medical or physical limitations and level of ability.
   A3.4.2. Ensure a safe environment for training IAW local policy (e.g., assessing traffic
   patterns, use of headphones or other personal equipment, temperature, availability of
   water/first aid, and awareness of emergency procedures).
       A3.4.2.1. Physical conditioning conducted in PT uniform (shorts and t-shirt) may be
       performed continuously up to 1 hour in all but “black flag” heat condition (90 degrees
       Fahrenheit and above). Recommend limiting fitness activities during “black flag” heat
       conditions to indoor activities.
   A3.4.3. For cold weather limitations consult tables A.4.1 and A4.2 in AFPAM 48-151,
   Thermal Injury.

                 ARC FITNESS ASSESSMENT DEFERRAL GUIDANCE

The AF Fitness Assessment (FA) is a maximum-effort exercise test. Airmen who have not
been exercising regularly and/or have risk factors for a heart attack (increasing age,
smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, etc.) are at increased risk of injury or death during
the test. You answered the questionnaire and identified yourself to be in the high risk
category. The following information and/or actions are strongly recommended before
attempting to participate in the AF Fitness Assessment after this one-time 90-day deferral:

   1. Contact your PCP (Personal Care Provider) for evaluation of your risk factors, medical treatment
      (if necessary), for dietary guidance, and (if appropriate) for an exercise prescription.
   2. It is also recommended that you review the Healthy Living Program via the links in AFFMS (Air
      Force Fitness Management System) site accessible on the AF Portal.
   3. If you wish to take the 1.5-mile run fitness test, request written documentation from your PCP
      regarding evaluation results and clearance to perform the 1.5-mile run. Without this
      documentation, you should understand that you will take the 1.0-mile walk as the aerobic
      component of the FA (unless a PCP has exempted you from the aerobic component of the FA).
   4. You must present written PCP clearance if desiring to take the 1.5-mile run AND any required
      medical documentation regarding unexplained symptoms or potential duty limiting conditions
      along with ARC Fitness Deferral Follow-up Questionnaire (Attachment 6) to your Medical
      Liaison Officer (MLO) before you will be allowed to perform AF FA. MLO will review
      documentation and indicate if member meets the requirements for the 1.5-mile run, the 1.0-mile
      walk or remains exempt from the aerobic or other portion of the AF FA.
   5. If MLO documents you meet requirements for the AF FA, you must report back to the UFPM for
      scheduling fitness assessment prior to the end of the 90-day deferral period.
   6. If, after this 90-day deferral, you continue to report a sedentary lifestyle, and modifiable risk
      factors (smoking, diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension or uncontrolled high cholesterol) remain
      then you remain at risk for illness or injury during the 1.5-mile run or 1.0-mile walk. You will
      NOT take either aerobic test (run or walk) and an “Unsatisfactory” score will be documented for
      your FA.
   7. If a medical condition is present that constitutes a “duty limiting” or “deployment limiting”
      condition which requires exemption from any portion of the AF FA fails to resolve after 12
      months, a World Wide Duty evaluation will be initiated IAW AFI 48-123.

                    MUSCLE FITNESS ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES

A7.1. Push-up Assessment Procedures.
   A7.1.1. Purpose. The push-up is used to assess the member’s upper body muscular fitness.
   A7.1.2. Assessment Duration. Members have 1 minute to complete as many push-ups as
   possible.
   A7.1.3. Assessment Explanation. The test assessor (FAC member or PTL) will read the
   push-up script to the member (A7.1.10.)
   A7.1.4. Starting Position. The member will begin in the starting position, with arms fully
   extended and the body in a straight line from head to heel. The feet may be no more than 12
   inches apart. The member may rest in the up position only. The body should maintain a rigid
   form from head to heel (the body may not bow unless resting in the up position). The feet
   may not be supported or braced.
   A7.1.5. Complete Push-up. From the starting position (elbows extended), the member will
   lower the body to the ground until the upper arm is at least parallel to the floor (elbow bent at
   least 90 degrees or less) before pushing back up to the starting position (the chest may touch
   but not rest on or bounce off the floor). The member completes one full push-up after
   returning to the starting position with elbows fully extended. It is important to monitor the
   member’s form and make sure the body does not bow at the waist as the member tires. The
   body must remain rigid during the assessment (the back must remain straight unless resting).
   Incorrect push-ups (e.g., member does not lower body until upper arm is at least parallel to
   the floor, member does not fully extend elbows when returning to starting position, body
   bows at the waist, etc…) will not be counted. If an incorrect push-up is performed, assessor
   will repeat the number of the last correct push-up and explain what is being done incorrectly.
   Member may rest in the up position only. If member rests in the down position with their
   body on the ground, the push-up component of the test will be terminated.
   A7.1.6. Stopwatch. The test assessor is responsible for operating the stopwatch. The
   assessor will start the stopwatch when the member(s) is/are instructed to begin, observe the
   assessment and notify the member how much time is remaining at 30 seconds and 15
   seconds. Prior to beginning the assessment the assessor will inform the members to continue
   to perform push-ups until directed to stop or until the member is no longer able to continue.
   A7.1.7. Counting/Monitoring. The assessor or another member paired to accomplish muscle
   fitness components will monitor and count the correct number of push-ups. However, if
   members are paired off for the assessment, the assessor should oversee and spot-check
   technique to ensure accurate and safe assessment. The counter/monitor will count the correct
   number of push-ups out loud, monitor the member for correct form and repeat the number of
   the last correct push-up. If the member breaks correct form, the monitor repeats the last
   correct number (e.g., one, two, three, three, four, etc.), as well as gives instruction on what
   was done incorrectly (e.g., you are not extending your elbows fully, keep your back straight,
   etc.). Monitor the member from a position that allows observance of the member’s form and
   the elbow joint.

   A7.1.8. Assessor will provide directions for and monitoring of the muscular FA components
   IAW para A7.1.10 and para A7.2.10. FAC personnel will demonstrate proper push-ups and
   sit-ups prior to administering the FA IAW para 1.20.1.3.
   A7.1.9. Completion/Recording. Upon completion of the assessment, record the total number
   of correct push-ups.
   A7.1.10. Push-Up Verbal Instructions. Test Administrator should state:
The push-up is an assessment of muscular fitness for the upper body (shoulder, chest, and
triceps).
Your hands will be placed on the floor, slightly wider than shoulder width apart.
You must lower your upper body until your upper arm is at least parallel to the floor and elbows
bent at 90 degrees before pushing back up to the starting position. If you do not come down that
far the push-up will not count.
Start in the up position with your elbows fully extended, feet no more than 12 inches apart, and
your weight supported by your arms and toes. You must keep your back straight at all times and
lower your upper body until your upper arm is at least parallel to the floor, then return to the up
position with arms fully extended. This is one repetition.
Resting must be done in the UP position. If you rest in the down position, this component of the
test will be terminated.
Your breathing should be as normal as possible. Make sure you do not hold your breath.
You have 1 minute to perform as many push-ups as you are able. The correct number of push-
ups will be counted out loud. Incorrect push-ups will not be counted, and the number of the last
correct push-up will be repeated. You will be told what you’re doing wrong until you correct the
error. The total number of correct push-ups in 1 minute will be recorded as your score.
A7.2. Sit-up Assessment Procedures.
   A7.2.1. Purpose. The sit-up component is used to assess a member’s muscular fitness.
   A7.2.2. Assessment Duration. The member will have 1 minute to complete as many sit-ups
   as possible.
   A7.2.3. Assessment Explanation. The sit-up instructions (A7.2.10) will be read to the
   member prior to the assessment.
   A7.2.4. Starting Position. The use of a mat is optional. The member will be instructed to lie
   face up on the floor/mat. In the starting position, the member’s feet may extend off the mat,
   but the buttocks, shoulders, and head must not extend beyond the mat. The member’s knees
   will be bent at a 90 degree angle, with the feet or heels in contact with the floor at all times.
   The member’s arms will be crossed over the chest with the hands at the shoulders or resting
   on the upper chest.
   A7.2.5. Foot Hold. The member’s heels must remain anchored to the floor throughout the
   assessment. The member may request to have their feet held down with the hands or by
   putting knees on feet but the monitor may not anchor the member’s legs by holding onto the
   calves during the assessment. Enough force must be applied to keep the feet/ankles from
   rising while the sit-ups are being accomplished. In place of a monitor holding the feet, an
AFI36-2905_916ARWSUP_I 5 APRIL 2013                                                              65


   anchored toe-hold bar may be used to anchor the feet so long as the member’s heels remain
   in contact with the ground at all times and the bar cannot move.
   A7.2.6. Complete Sit-up. A complete sit-up is accomplished when the upper torso of the
   member is raised off the floor/mat, the elbows touch the knees or thighs, and the upper torso
   is lowered back to the floor/mat until the shoulder blades touch the floor/mat. Elbows must
   touch the knees or thighs at the top of the sit-up, and the shoulder blades must touch
   the floor/mat at the bottom of the sit-up. The hands must stay in contact with the
   shoulders/upper chest at all times. Incorrect sit-ups (e.g., elbows do not touch the knees or
   thighs at the top of the sit-up, shoulder blades do not touch the floor/mat at the bottom of the
   sit- up, hands do not stay in contact with the shoulders/upper chest at all times, etc.) will not
   be counted. If an incorrect sit-up is performed, assessor will repeat the number of the last
   correct sit-up and explain what is being done incorrectly. The member may only rest in the
   up position. If the member rests in the down position or holds onto their knees/legs while in
   the up position, the sit-up component of the assessment will be terminated.
   A7.2.7. Stopwatch. The assessor is responsible for operating the stopwatch. The assessor
   will start the stopwatch when the member(s) is/are instructed to begin, observe the
   assessment and notify the member how much time is remaining at 30 seconds and 15
   seconds. Prior to beginning the assessment the assessor will inform the members to continue
   to perform sit-ups until directed to stop or until the member is no longer able to continue.
   A7.2.8. Counting/Monitoring. The assessor or another member paired to accomplish muscle
   fitness components will monitor and count the correct number of sit-ups. However, if
   members are paired off for the assessment, the assessor should oversee and spot-check
   technique to ensure accurate and safe assessment. The counter/monitor will count the correct
   number of sit-ups out loud, monitor the member for correct form and repeat the number of
   the last correct sit-up if the member breaks correct form (e.g., one, two, three, three, four,
   etc.). In addition to repeating the last correct number, give the member instruction on what is
   wrong (e.g., you’re shoulder blades are not touching the mat/floor, keep your hands on your
   shoulders or chest, etc.). Monitor the member from a position that allows observance to
   ensure the shoulder blades touch the floor and elbows touch the knees or thighs.
   A7.2.9. Completion/Recording: upon completion of the assessment, record the total number
   of correct sit-ups.
   A7.2.10. Sit-up Verbal Instructions. Test Administrator should state:
This is a muscular fitness assessment. Please lie on your back with your heels flat on the floor,
knees bent at a 90 degree angle, and your arms crossed in front of the chest such that your
hands/fingers remain in contact with your shoulders or chest.
If a toe hold bar is used: Anchor your feet to the ground by hooking your feet/toes under the
bar. Your heels may not rise off the ground while you perform the assessment. If a toe hold bar
is NOT used: Your feet will be held down with your monitor’s hands or knees. Your legs may
not be held behind your calves. Let your monitor know if you need your feet held differently
prior to beginning the assessment (e.g.,“You’re holding my ankles/feet too tight or not
enough.”).
Your hips must remain on the floor at all times (do not lift your hips off the floor to gain
momentum). Your shoulder blades must touch the floor between each repetition. In the up

position, you will touch your elbows to your knees or thighs and return down until your shoulder
blades touch the floor (your hands must stay in contact with your shoulders/chest at all times).
This will count as one sit-up.
Your breathing should be as normal as possible. Make sure you do not hold your breath.
You have 1 minute to perform as many correct sit-ups as possible. Any resting must be done in
the UP position. If you rest in the down position with shoulder blades touching the floor or if
you hold your knees/legs while resting in the up position, this component of the test will be
terminated.
The correct number of sit-ups will be counted out loud. Incorrect sit-ups will not be counted
and the number of last correct sit-up will be repeated and you will be told what you’re doing
wrong until you correct the error. Your score will be the total number of correct sit-ups com-
pleted in 1 minute.

timed walk (1760 yards/1609 meters).
   A8.1.1. Establish a standard course of accurate distance that is as level and even as possible.
      A8.1.1.1. If a typical 6-lap track is used:
          A8.1.1.1.1. For a 1.5-mile timed run, it should be 440 yards per lap; or 6 laps on a
          400-meter track plus an additional 46 feet for 1.5-miles.
          A8.1.1.1.2. For a 1.0-mile timed walk, it should be 440 yards per lap; or 4 laps on a
          400-meter track plus an additional 31 feet for 1.0-mile.
      A8.1.1.2. Course should have limited exposure to traffic, should not have a continuous
      incline/decline or rolling hills; avoid slopes exceeding two degrees. If using a road
      course, where possible, start and finish should be at the same location.
      A8.1.1.3. Clearly mark the start and finish lines (and half-way point for road courses).
   A8.1.2. Trained personnel will monitor participants, ensuring all members complete entire
   course and are continuously observed for course completion, safety, counting laps if required
   and recording run times.
   A8.1.3. Indoor track may be used during inclement weather.
A8.2. Evaluate course safety/environmental conditions to determine if assessment can be
properly conducted.
   A8.2.1. Snow: no snow accumulation on the running surface.

       MEDICATIONS AFFECTING AF FITNESS PROGRAM PARTICIPATION

This attachment lists medications that may preclude aerobic components in the FA. Before
considering medications for a medical exemption, the underlying condition should be addressed
as a potential reason for exemption. Chronic conditions that result in medical exemption from
any aerobic components should be reviewed for possible MEB IAW AFI 48-123.
Any medication that affects the heart rate or the heart’s response to exercise may invalidate
aerobic components of the FA. Chronic medications should not be discontinued simply to allow
the fitness assessment if this would adversely impact the member’s health or safety. Over-the-
counter (OTC) medications or “supplements” of any kind should not be a cause for exemption
unless the OTC medications/supplements are specifically recommended by a provider and this
recommendation is documented in the medical record. Members using acute, short-term
medications that result in component exemptions should be given a temporary profile until the
medication is no longer needed.

Table A.13. is not an all-inclusive list of all medications that could potentially affect FA
participation. Furthermore, individual patient situations may require exemptions beyond what is
detailed here. The member’s provider shall not be constrained by this Table in making
exemptions.

                       1.0-MILE TIMED WALK INSTRUCTIONS

A15.1. Criteria. The following criteria must be considered prior to the 1.0-mile timed walk
assessment.
   A15.1.1. Members completing the assessment must wear proper fitness attire (e.g., AF PT
   gear and fitness shoes).
   A15.1.2. Members must warm-up prior to completing the assessment.
   A15.1.3. Members must complete the FSQ.
   A15.1.4. Course safety/environmental conditions as described in Attachment 8 (para
   A8.2).
   A15.1.5. The test assessor (FAC member or PTL) will give instructions on administering
   and monitoring of the muscular FA components. Muscular FA may be completed before or
   after the 1.0-mile timed walk assessment/5 minute cool-down.
A15.2. Requirements.
   A15.2.1. A measured 1.0-mile, uninterrupted course (preferably a ¼ mile track) approved by
   the Wing CC. The course will meet requirements of para A8.1, with the exception of the
   number of laps.
   A15.2.2. Sufficient trained personnel must be present to be able to monitor members at all
   times, to record laps if necessary, and to record walk completion times.
   A15.2.3. Additional equipment requirements include timers, notepads, scorecards,
   pens/pencils, and heart rate (HR) monitors.
A15.3. Administering the 1.0-mile walk assessment.
   A15.3.1. The member is required to walk 1.0-mile (1609 meters) as quickly as possible.
   Member must walk, but not run, keeping at least one foot in contact with the ground at all
   times.
   A15.3.2. Record the participant’s HR immediately upon the completion of the mile by
   reading the value from the heart rate monitor.
A15.4. Scoring results of the 1.0-mile walk assessment.
   A15.4.1. Use test standards in Attachments 16 and 17 with formula below.
   A15.4.2. Calculate member’s score (estimated VO2 max) using the following formula which
   incorporates body weight (lb), age (yr), gender (males = 1, females = 0), time to complete
   one mile (min), and post exercise heart rate (bpm):
Estimated VO2 max (ml/kg/min) =
132.853 – 0.0769(Weight) – 0.3877(Age) + 6.315(Gender) – 3.2649(Time) – 0.1565(HR)
EXAMPLE: If a 33 year old male (weight 160 lbs) completed the walk in 11 minutes and 20
seconds and had a post-exercise HR of 160 bpm, his estimated VO2 max would be 52 ml/kg/min
AFI36-2905_916ARWSUP_I 5 APRIL 2013                                                       87


(as calculated here): Score (estimated VO2 max) = 132.853 – 0.0769(160) – 0.3877(33) +
6.315(1) – 3.2649(11.33) – 0.1565(160) = 52 ml/kg/min
An estimated VO2 max score of 52 ml/kg/min is a “passing” score because it exceeds the
minimum VO2 component score of 38 for a 33 year old male as defined in Attachment 16.
Attachment 17 identifies a VO2 max score of 52 ml/kg/min to equate to 59.3 points toward a
composite score.
It is important to note that completion time must be converted to minutes. This is
accomplished by dividing the number of seconds by 60 and adding this value to the whole
value for minutes. In the above example, the total time was 11 minutes and 20 seconds.
When expressed as minutes, this equals 11 minutes + (20/60 seconds) or 11.33 minutes.
Safety is the number one concern. If during or after the test, the member experiences unusual
shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness or lightheadedness, or any other unusual symptoms,
please notify FAC or FA administrator immediately.

NOTES:
     1 Commanders may render an individual ineligible for reenlistment rather than denying
       reenlistment by specifying ineligibility versus non-selection on the AF Form 418,
       Selective Reenlistment Program Consideration. This allows the flexibility of
       authorizing an individual to extend their reenlistment for either 4 or 7 months (7 or 12
       for ARC) to improve their fitness level. Individuals non-selected for reenlistment are
       not allowed to extend for any reason and will separate on the date of separation (DOS).
       Commanders may complete a second AF Form 418 changing the member’s
       ineligibility or non-selection status at any time.
       2 For ARC, the use of this option should be weighed against use of administrative
         separation and is applicable where recall of this member would not jeopardize mission
         readiness.
