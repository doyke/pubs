Section I—General

1. Purpose: This operating instruction provides an overview and guidance on the use of
simulated munitions as a warfighter training enhancer during force-on-force and air base defense
type exercises. Simulated munitions are a reduced energy, reduced impact, training ammunition
that can be safely fired from existing service weapons. Upon impact it produces a detergent-
based, water-soluble inert color marking very similar to a paint-ball. This instruction establishes
procedures and practices for proper storage, transportation, handling, and use of simulated
munitions. It applies to all personnel participating in exercises or training involving simulated
munitions at Wright-Patterson AFB. This instruction must be present when the applicable
operations are being conducted.
   1.1. Background:
       1.1.1. USAF training technology does not meet all force-on-force training requirements
       for personnel. Specifically, the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES)
       significantly limits realistic effects since its use depends on blank ammunition and
       limiting factors (LIMFACs) associated with laser technology. These LIMFACs include
       minimum safe weapons firing distances of 20 feet or more, lack of weapons versatility
       (limited to using rifles and machine guns), ammunition availability and encouraging the
       use of unrealistic cover and concealment practices. Additionally, firing range LIMFACs
       exists that prevent units from conducting live-fire training involving shooter movement
       forward of the firing line or transversely. This prevents units from conducting tactical or
       shoot and move training.
       1.1.2. Simulated munitions conversion kits are designed to look, feel, function and have
       the same balance and safety features as standard service weapons. Tactics can be
       practiced and skills honed, but the effectiveness of those skills and tactics cannot be
       appreciated until put to the test in a real life situation. By utilizing dye-marking
       cartridges and conversion kit systems, it is possible to provide realistic training in
       multiple environments.
       1.1.3. One of the most effective uses of these munitions and kits for warfighters to
       conduct tactical or ―Shoot, Move and Communicate‖ training at the base level. After
       progressing through weapons familiarization, dry fire drills, and training with simulators,
       units can employ learned techniques using training with dye-marking cartridges. This is
       especially useful on Wright-Patterson AFB due to limitations regarding live-fire training
       facilities.
   1.2. Responsibility:
       1.2.1. Simulated Munitions Training Equipment. The 88th Warfighter Training
       Operations Branch (88 ABW/XPW) has primary responsibility for training non-security
       forces Wright-Patterson Airmen on tactics using simulated munitions and equipment.
       Simulated munitions training equipment for this purpose will be funded/ordered by the 88
       ABW or 88 ABW/XP for 88 ABW trainees. The 88th Security Forces Squadron (88
       SFS) will fund/order/maintain simulated munitions training equipment for security forces
       simulated munitions training. 88 ABW/XPW and 88 SFS will develop their own storage
       and accountability procedures.
4                                       WRIGHT-PATTERSONAFBI36-2224 18 JULY 2012


       1.2.2. Simulated Munitions Ammunition. The 88 SFS will forecast, order, and be
       custodians of all simulated munitions ammunition required for security forces training.
       The 88 ABW/XPW will forecast, order, and be custodians of all simulated munitions
       ammunition required for all other simulated munitions training on Wright-Patterson AFB.
       1.2.3. The 88th Air Base Wing Warfighter Training Operations Branch (for Warfighter
       Training Center training) and the 88th Security Forces Squadron commander (for security
       forces training) will ensure only trained and qualified personnel will handle, transport,
       store, and supervise the firing of simulated munitions. Training requirements are listed in
       paragraph 1.4 of this instruction.
    1.3. Administrative Requirements:
       1.3.1. The 88th Air Base Wing Chief, Plans and Programs Division (88 ABW/XP) will
       appoint (in writing) Warfighter Training Operations Branch personnel who are trained,
       qualified, and of the appropriate grade (E-5 or above, to include civilian equivalents) to
       perform duties as a Range Safety Officer and authorized to conduct and supervise
       simulated munitions training for personnel at the Warfighter Training Center.
       1.3.2. The 88th Security Forces Squadron commander will appoint (in writing) security
       forces personnel who are trained, qualified, and of the appropriate grade (E-4 or above) to
       perform duties as a Range Safety Officer and authorized to conduct and supervise
       simulated munitions training for base security forces personnel.
       1.3.3. The 88th Air Base Wing Chief, Plans and Programs Division (88 ABW/XP) (for
       Warfighter Training Center training) and the 88th Security Forces Squadron commander
       (for security forces training) will appoint (in writing) ammunition custodians for
       simulated munitions.
    1.4. Cadre/Program Management Training Requirements. All appointed Range Safety
    Officers must be trained and certified. Range Safety Officers must be an E-5 (GS-9 for
    civilians) or above (E-4 or above if assigned to 88 SFS) and a graduate of the 96 GCTS
    Simulated Munitions Safety Course, other approved HQ AFMC/SFXT approved training
    course, or be trained by a Range Safety Officer who has completed the 96 GCTS Simulated
    Munitions Safety Course or other HQ AFMC/SFXT approved course.
    1.5. Basic Training Area Requirements:
       1.5.1. Training areas will, as a minimum, contain 3 distinctive zones. They are: unsafe
       zone, semi-safe zone, and safe zone. (See Figure 1).
       1.5.2. The unsafe zone is the area where all unapproved weapons and ammunition (if
       brought to the training area) are kept. This area must be located away from the semi-safe
       and safe zones.
       1.5.3. The semi-safe zone is the area where all briefings, equipment storage, and scenario
       preparation takes place. This area must be separated from the safe zone by a physical
       barrier or located outside the round impact area (145 meters).
       1.5.4. The safe zone is where all scenarios take place.

Section II.—- Safety Requirements

2. Safety Requirements: The improper use of simulated munitions can cause injury, loss,
damage, or death. Users should exercise the same firearm handling precautions as with live
ammunition. Simulated munitions should only be used in well maintained, properly functioning
weapons. Always keep the barrel free of any obstruction.
   2.1. General Requirements:
       2.1.1. Members must always safely handle weapons in accordance with directives found
       in AFMAN 31-229.
       2.1.2. All handguns must be carried in an authorized holster or approved container.
       2.1.3. AFMAN 31-229 directed weapons clearing procedures must be clearly posted
       within 10 feet of clearing barrels used to clear weapons prior to converting them to use
       for simulated munitions.
       2.1.4. All personnel issued weapons for training purposes will have a proper conversion
       kit installed. FX kits contain a replacement upper receiver and barrel assembly, two clear
       20-round replacement magazines, a soft carry case, and an operator/armorer manual.
       Ultimate Training Munitions (UTM) kits use a bolt carrier group replacement only.
       2.1.5. A 5-meter standoff distance is required. NEVER fire simulated munitions at
       personnel within 5-meters of weapon. NEVER intentionally fire simulated munitions at a
       person‘s head or neck area. Rifles will NOT be fired in burst mode as it can create a
       concentrated impact area and increase risk of injury.
       2.1.6. Only personnel participating in training (or observers specifically authorized by
       Range Safety Officer) will be permitted within 150 feet of the training area. Vehicles
       will not be parked within 100 feet of any simulated munitions storage location.

       2.1.7. All windows on facilities in the actual training area must be closed. If any
       windows in the training area are inoperative, broken, or have been removed, then a board
       must be in place to prevent any simulated munitions round from passing through the
       window (from the inside or outside).
       2.1.8. If explosives become engulfed in flames, personnel will be evacuated to a
       minimum distance of 300 feet.
       2.1.9. If possible, arm weapons security guards (who have live ammunition) with a
       weapon which fires a different type/caliber of ammunition than the type of simulated
       munitions being utilized within the training environment.
       2.1.10. Range Safety Officers MUST have a copy of, review prior to training, and
       comply with all directions in the UTM Technical Data Sheet and Recommended
       Guidelines for Use when using UTM simulated munitions. This document can be located
       on       the     UTM       website    in     the       document      library      at
       http://utmworldwide.com/library/Category.aspx?categoryid=12. NOTE: There are
       separate Data Sheets/Guidelines for linked and non-linked 5.56 UTM simulated
       munitions.
       2.1.11. IAW Appendix E of the HQ AFSFC Close Combat Mission Capability Kit
       (CCMCK) Training CONOPS: Except for the Security Forces Shoot, Move, and
       Communicate Course, individuals are not required to be weapons qualified in accordance
       with AFI 36-2226 on the weapon(s) utilized before participating in dye-marking cartridge
       training. However, they must be trained on weapons safety and operator mechanical skills
       (e.g. loading, clearing, unloading, reloading, immediate action, ammunition
       identification/use, etc.). Individuals who are currently qualified, in accordance with AFI
       36-2226, do not require this portion of training. All personnel participating in dye-
       marking training must be familiar with all safety requirements and have personnel
       protective equipment. They must be able to distinguish between live and dye-marking
       ammunition. This training must be documented on AF Form 797, Job Qualification
       Standard Continuation/Command JQS. All personnel will follow standardized USAF
       weapon handling procedures outlined in AFMAN 31-229, USAF Weapons Handling
       Manual.
    2.2. Conversion Kit Operation/Marking:
       2.2.1. Once installed, the conversion kits convert the rifle to a straight, blowback
       operating system. The FX conversion kits for the rifles must allow the chambering of
       9mm marker ammunition. UTM conversion kits for rifles use 5.56 simulated munitions.
       FX conversion kits have a blue upper receiver. UTM conversion kits have blue on the
       bolt carrier group and use blue magazines.
       2.2.2. The M9 pistol conversion kit must be a single piece barrel that will not chamber a
       conventional 9mm cartridge.
       2.2.3. All M9 barrels will be painted blue or gold and marked ―9mm MARKING CTG
       ONLY NO STANDARD AMMO.‖
    2.3. Lesson Plan Certification. Only certified personnel will conduct training and exercises.
    Approved lesson plans must be used. Wright-Patterson AFB simulated munitions lesson

  plans will be approved by either The 88th Air Base Wing Warfighter Training Operations
  Branch Chief (for Warfighter Training Center training) or the 88th Security Forces Squadron
  commander (for security forces training).
  2.4. Personal Protective/Safety Equipment Use/Procedures.
     2.4.1. All personal protective equipment (i.e., complete skin coverage, full-face
     protection (to include eye protection), throat protection, gloves, and groin protection) is
     MANDATORY for wear when using simulated munitions. When using UTM simulated
     munitions TWO layers of clothing are required. Use of a chest/breast protector is
     optional.
     2.4.2. If any mandatory safety equipment becomes dislodged during training
     immediately cover the area with your hands, drop to your knee and call ―cease fire‖. DO
     NOT remove any equipment until instructed to do so.
     2.4.3. Hearing protection must be used by all personnel. Unit commanders are
     responsible for providing hearing protection for their unit members.
     2.4.4. A minimum of two serviceable 2A10BC or larger fire extinguishers must be
     immediately available during firing of simulated munitions.
     2.4.5. There will be NO SMOKING within 50 feet of any simulated munitions storage
     location.
  2.5. Explosives Limits:
     2.5.1. The operating/training location and storage location (combined) must not exceed
     the type and quantity of explosives authorized on the Explosives Facility License (AF
     Form 2047, Explosives Facility License). If the presence of ammunition is temporary
     (not lasting more than a day) and the ammunition will not be stored at the training
     location, then the following information must be posted: Nomenclature, Hazard
     Classification/Compatibility Group, and total quantity of rounds.
         2.5.1.1. Nomenclature: 9mm FX Dye-Marking Cartridges (Blue & Red).
         2.5.1.2. Hazard Classification/Compatibility Group: 1.4S.
         2.5.1.3. Total Quantity Used or Stored: 800 rounds (example).
         2.5.1.4. Prominently post/display a copy of the approved explosives facility license
         in the room where simulated munitions are stored. When explosives are required to
         be stored at the Warfighter Training Center (WTC), they will be stored in Bldg 885,
         WTC Armory.
         2.5.1.5. Notify the Emergency Communication Center at (937) 257-3033 each time
         the facility fire symbol changes.
  2.6. Range Safety Officers will:
     2.6.1. Conduct Pre-Task Safety Briefings prior to each operation (Attachment 3).
     2.6.2. Ensure immediate action (misfire/corrective) weapons procedures have been
     instructed to all personnel.

                                     SAFETY BRIEFING

A3.1. (RSO) All weapons to be used in this training evolution will have the proper weapons
conversion kits installed. All weapons will be marked with brightly colored blue tape where it is
easily visible and doesn‘t interfere with the functioning of the weapon.
A3.2. All magazines to be utilized in this evolution will be inspected by me (RSO) and marked
with brightly colored blue tape or be blue training magazines. All magazines not inspected and
marked will be removed from the immediate training area. Ammunition will not be loaded into
magazines until training is ready to commence. I will observe the loading of all magazines with
the training marker (TM). No marker of any kind will be carried in pockets at any time. I will
inspect all weapons and magazines after this brief.
A3.3. All personnel will wear proper protective gear. Approved full-face mask, helmet, gloves,
throat, and groin protection is MANDATORY. All exposed skin must be covered. Chest
protection is optional. If UTM simunitions are being used, all personnel must be wearing two
layers of clothing. Wearing of all protective gear includes all participants and observers. Does
everyone have the required safety equipment?
A3.4. I (RSO) am the only person who can grant permission for the training cycle to begin.
When I am satisfied with the training area, proper clothing, protective equipment, and safety of
the intended scenario, I will start the training cycle by announcing the range is ―HOT‖. When
the training cadre tells you to load, point your weapons in a safe direction, charge it, re-
holster/sling the weapon and prepare for the scenario. At no time will a loaded weapon leave the
training area. All standard weapon safety rules apply while on the range and involved in
training.
A3.5. At no time shall any attending personnel remove any safety equipment until I have called
the range ―COLD‖. I will need a full accounting of personnel and all weapons will be cleared
and a buddy-check performed before I call the range ―COLD.‖
A3.6. If you hear ―CEASE FIRE‖ you will immediately stop training, point your weapon in a
safe direction, place the weapons safety selector to the safe position, and wait for further
instructions. If anybody sees anything they think is unsafe, shout ―CEASE FIRE‖. All training
will stop until the condition is made safe. If you hear ―CEASE FIRE‖ you must echo the
command.
A3.7. If any mandatory safety equipment becomes dislodged during training, immediately cover
the area with your hands, drop to your knee and call ―cease fire‖. DO NOT remove any
equipment until instructed to do so.
A3.8. If at any time a medical emergency occurs the command ―CEASE FIRE‖ fire will be
given and the range will be made ―COLD.‖ All unaffected participants will proceed to ―Semi-
safe‖ zone. Medical attention will then be given to affected personnel. When a medical
emergency occurs, an immediate assessment will be made to determine if 911 should be called.
Medical attention will then be given to affected personnel by instructor staff while awaiting
further medical response or in order to return the student to training.

A3.9. Never fire marking ammunition at personnel within five meters of weapon. A 5-meter
standoff distance is required. Never intentionally fire simulated munitions at a person‘s head or
neck area. Rifles will NOT be fired in burst mode as it can create a concentrated impact area and
increase risk of injury. Do you have any questions?

A4.1. (Training Cadre) Today we will be conducting training using training markers and
weapons conversion kits. Prior to entering the semi-safe zone, you were told, by the RSO, not to
bring anything lethal into the area with you. You should have all required protective equipment
and gear. If you leave the semi-safe zone at any time you must be re-inspected by the RSO.
A4.2. I will assign the students to teams and issue the scenario brief. Next I will assign role
players, and support personnel and issue them instructions. The role-players, support personnel
and I will accompany the RSO to the entrance of the ―SAFE‖ zone for a pre-training safety
inspection by the RSO. After being inspected I will brief you on your assigned duties.
A4.3. All personnel must be inspected prior to entering the ―SAFE‖ zone. When I complete the
safety check, the RSO will make the range ―HOT‖. Students will be issued their weapons and
instructed to stand by. I will have students face in a safe direction, load and make ready their
weapons. I will then begin the scenario.
A4.4. Remember to keep alert and treat the scenario as real world. Keep safety in mind at all
times. Upon completion of the scenario, you will hear the command to ―CEASE FIRE‖.
Personnel with weapons, when instructed, will face in safe direction and clear and safe their
weapons. The RSO and I will inspect all cleared weapons. Once the RSO is satisfied all
personnel, weapons and equipment are accounted for and safe, he will call the range ―COLD‖
and give permission to remove masks. You may NOT remove your mask until the range is
declared ―COLD‖. All weapons will be returned to the RSO prior to leaving the ―SAFE‖ area.
Debrief will be conducted at my discretion. Are there any questions?

       A7.4.2.1. IAW the WPAFB Integrated Defense Plan, all USAF Security Forces
       personnel will conduct training focused on response to Active Shooter incidents.
       Simulated munitions allows SF units to effectively train for this type of incident. The
       following training/safety operations apply during SF active shooter training while
       utilizing simulated munitions.
          A7.4.2.1.1. All training operations will have a dedicated Range Safety Officer.
          A7.4.2.1.2. The Range Safety Officer will conduct a walk-through of the facility
          prior to initiation of training to identify and mark any unsafe conditions that may arise
          during evaluations and operations.
          A7.4.2.1.3. Due to the nature of training as well as the constant change of training
          locations, a dedicated and standardized location for the Safe Zone, Semi-Safe Zone,
          and Unsafe Zone is not possible. These three distinct zones will be utilized for all

          allowing personnel to enter the training area.
          A7.4.2.1.4. The Range Safety Officer will conduct a safety briefing with all
          personnel in attendance. The safety briefing will include weapons safety, use of
          proper safety gear, the three distinct training zones, and identified safety hazards.
      A7.4.2.2. Instructor ratios/range guards. The following instructor/student ratios will be
      maintained during all orders requiring movement.
          A7.4.2.2.1. Range Guard: One personnel will be posted as a range guard, controlling
          access to the safe zone. The Range Safety Officer will brief the Range Guard on
          their responsibilities. The basic function of the Range Guard is to ensure no
          additional personnel enter the safe zone while training is ongoing and to clear all
          weapons (ensure they are safe/clear) upon exiting the safe zone.
          A7.4.2.2.2. Training Cadre: Each four man fire team conducting training will have a
          minimum of one Training Cadre with them at all times of movement. The Training
          Cadre is responsible to ensure all training is conducted in a safe manner and to
          identify any safety hazards that may arise during the training exercise.
