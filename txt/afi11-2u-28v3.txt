SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is entirely new and must be reviewed in its entirety. Table 3.1 incorporates crew
member body weight limitations into Table 3.1 Crew Complement. Paragraph 3.2.2 adds
guidance for CSOs logging flight time on PC-12 Trainer aircraft. Paragraph 3.6.1.2 specifies a
maximum flight duty period of 14 hours for all mission events, as specified in AFI 11-2U28V1,
U-28 Aircrew Training. Paragraph 5.1 specifies 10,450 lbs max takeoff weight for PC-12
Trainers and restricts operations above 10,450 lbs to U-28s only. All functional check flight
(FCF) and short field references have been removed. Paragraph 5.2.3 lowers the requirement to
complete ―Before Landing Checklist‖ to 100 feet above ground level (AGL), and lowers
requirement for aircraft to be established on final, wings level, with a controlled rate of descent
in a position to execute a safe landing to 100 feet AGL. Paragraph 5.11.2 incorporates PC-12/U-
28 wake turbulence spacing. Paragraph 5.12 removes short field association with landings at
LZs marked with airfield marking patterns (AMP). Paragraph 5.12.3 specifies airfield suitability
and restriction report/zone availability report (ASRR/ZAR) as source for approved U-28/PC-12
airfields. Paragraph 5.14 removed short field operations and added precision landing criteria.
Paragraph 5.14.2 updated the PC-12/U-28 minimum runway width. Paragraph 5.14.4.1 updates
AMP-3 minimum touchdown zone to 30 feet wide by 200 feet long. Paragraph 5.22 removes
engine running off load information, which is located in the POH. Paragraph 5.23 adds declared
distances guidance. Paragraph 6.1 removes requirement to wear gloves for takeoff and landing,
but still requires gloves to be readily available during flight. Paragraph 6.18 adds warning for
night vision goggles (NVG) use during ―black hole‖ conditions. Paragraph 6.18.1 adds
requirement for Sq/DO or CC approval for tactical approaches when illumination is below 10%.
Paragraph 6.19.1 changes arrival fuel to 300 pounds during all conditions. Paragraph 6.34 adds
enhanced ground proximity warning system (EGPWS) guidance, and paragraph 6.35 adds traffic
collision avoidance system (TCAS) guidance. Paragraph 6.43.2 adds requirement to fly no
slower than centered angle of attack (AOA) around the final turn and on final until preparing for
landing. Paragraph 6.47 adds maximum rate descent guidance. Paragraph 8.2.3 removed
description of tactical departures and arrivals and directs that these procedures will be flown in
accordance with U-28 Tactics Manuals. Paragraph 8.9 adds laser usage guidance. Paragraph
9.4.3 adds hung flare description. Paragraph 9.7.2 adds requirement for aircraft to be wings level
in a position to execute a safe landing no lower than 100 feet AGL. Paragraph 9.7.2.2 adds
requirement for instructor pilot (IP) directed go-around during simulated engine out approach if
the airspeed is slower than centered AOA or if the landing gear does not indicate ―Down, Three
Green.‖ Chapter 11 added Combat Systems Officer Specific Operational Guidelines.

                                          Chapter 2

                             COMMAND AND CONTROL (C2)

2.1. General. The AFSOC C2 system is based on the principles of centralized monitoring and
decentralized command and control and execution. The result is a C2 mechanism which keeps
the AFSOC/CC informed of the current status of AFSOC forces while enabling the Wing,
Group, or Squadron Commander to exercise control over the day-to-day operations.
2.2. Operational Control (OPCON). AFSOC is the air component to the United States Special
Operations Command (USSOCOM). USSOCOM may delegate OPCON of all Air Force Special
Operations Forces (AFSOF) aircraft assigned or allocated to USSOCOM. In circumstances
where OPCON of AFSOF aircraft has been provided to the Theater Special Operations
Commands (TSOCs) within a Geographic Combatant Command for theater-based assets,
AFSOC is typically designated as the controlling agency for such assets. EXCEPTION: In
practice, responsibility for planning and executing AFSOC missions is routinely delegated to the
Wing/CC or Group/CC. The Wing/CC or Group/CC, in turn, exercises control of non-close-hold
missions through command post supporting wing or group. In the event that assigned forces
undergo a change in operational control, responsibility for mission monitoring passes from the
wing or group C2 facility to the gaining command. Changeover will be accomplished in
accordance with the pertinent Operational Plan, Operational Order, Deployment Order, or
Execution Order. NOTE: For certain close-hold activities, security considerations may compel
the Wing or Group Commander to shift mission monitoring responsibilities from the command
post to another wing, group, or theater agency. The Wing/CC or Group/CC will ensure
procedures are established for the responsible agency to monitor mission progress and advise the
HQ AFSOC/A3 or AFSOC/CC as appropriate.
2.3. Mission Monitoring. Except for selected close-hold missions, the owning wing exercises
OPCON of all AFSOC and ARC units when transiting to/from, or between off-station locations.
The Operations Center tracks off-station aircraft via the Air Mobility Command (AMC) C2
system and direct reporting from aircrew and command post personnel. Key components of the
AMC C2 system are the Airlift Implementation and Monitoring System (AIMS), the Global
Decision Support System (GDSS), and various AMC C2 facilities at theater and wing locations.
Information on scheduled activity comes from the wings, who input AIMS data for all upcoming
missions except local missions not scheduled to land outside the local flying area or close-hold
missions that cannot be accommodated by classified ―J-coded‖ AIMS setups. When aircraft are
deployed in support of operations and exercises, the Operations Center obtains additional
information from Situation Reports (SITREP) and Deployed Status Reports (DSR). The
following mission monitoring procedures primarily apply to missions that are not close-hold in
nature and have not been CHOPed to another command:
   2.3.1. Wing (or equivalent) Command Posts track continental United States (CONUS)
   movements of their aircraft and directly input mission information into the GDSS. These
   actions keep the AFSOC/CC informed of the status and location of CONUS forces.
   2.3.2. Information on Outside Continental United States movements of AFSOC aircraft
   (OCONUS or theater-based) comes to the AFSOC Operations Center via GDSS or telephone
   notification from the overseas host unit command posts. The host unit command posts
 12                                                     AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012


   receive their data from the aircrews directly or via the Special Operations Command and
   Control Squadron or Element.
   2.3.3. Unclassified Missions at Bases with an AMC C2 Facility. The Mission Commander
   (MC) or PIC will use all practical means to ensure the following information is relayed to the
   AMC C2 facility at least 30 minutes prior to landing: call sign(s), mission number(s),
   Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA), maintenance status, and additional service requirements.
   After landing, the MC or PIC will contact the C2 facility with ground handling requirements
   and departure information. In addition, CONUS-based crews operating within the CONUS
   must keep their home station command posts appraised of all actual takeoff and landing
   times, projected takeoff times, and other related information.
   2.3.4. Unclassified Missions at Bases without an AMC C2 Facility. The MC or PIC will
   report, as soon as possible, actual takeoff and landing times, maintenance status, projected
   takeoff times, and other pertinent data to the theater command post/reporting agency or
   AFSOC Operations Center. Methods of communicating this information include High
   Frequency (HF) phone patch, Defense Switched Network (DSN), and commercial telephone.
   CONUS-based crews operating within the CONUS must also ensure that their home station
   command posts receive real-time reports on aircraft movements.
   2.3.5. J-coded AIMS Missions. When operating on J-coded missions, the MC or PIC will
   pass movement reports to the appropriate C2 facility. The MC or PIC will make
   arrangements with the theater command post/reporting agency or AFSOC Operations Center
   to pass pertinent flight information via secure voice or data communications. If necessary,
   call on an unclassified line and report. For example, ―Loaded and ready to go. Estimated
   Time of Departure is as fragged‖. NOTE: For missions requiring special handling above
   and beyond basic J-code procedures, C2 procedures will be outlined in the tasking directive.
   2.3.6. Close-hold or Sensitive Missions. These missions may operate without AIMS setups.
   Reference the note preceding this paragraph.
   2.3.7. Regional Reporting Agencies. CONUS Special Operations Wing (SOW) and below
   taskings: Wing Command Center. Above wing level taskings: Wing Command post with
   coordination through AFSOC Operations Flight. OCONUS and Deployed taskings:
   COMAFSOF with coordination through AFSOC Operations Flight.
2.4. Designation of a COMAFSOF. The USSOCOM, AFSOC, or Theater Special Operations
Command Commander may designate a COMAFSOF. This should be done in writing, and the
designation letter will include the individual by name, and the geographic area of authority. In
the absence of a designated COMAFSOF, HQ AFSOC/A3 may grant COMAFSOF waiver
authority to an individual in writing. Update the designation letter to reflect personnel changes
due to prolonged deployments. A copy of the designation letter will be maintained by the
AFSOC Command Center.
2.5. Mission Commander. A mission commander (MC) will be designated when more than
one aircraft or crew is deployed away from home station for training, exercises, or other
operations. It is highly encouraged that designated MCs attended the AFSOC approved Mission
Commanders Course. The MC will be a rated officer and should not be used as a primary crew
member. In cases where it is necessary for the MC to fly, ensure a senior unit member or

   2.6.7. Responsible for the timely reporting of aircraft movements in the absence of a MC.
2.7. Mission Clearance Decision. The final decision to delay a mission may be made either by
the agency with OPCON or the PIC when, in the opinion of either, conditions are not safe to start
or continue a mission. Final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with the PIC.
If the PIC refuses a mission, it will not depart until the conditions have been corrected or
improved so that the mission can operate safely. Another PIC and aircrew will not be alerted to
take the same mission under the same conditions.
   2.7.1. Diverting or rerouting a mission must be authorized by the commander with OPCON,
   except in an emergency or when required by en route or terminal weather conditions or
   facilities. In the event of an emergency or weather-related divert or reroute, the MC or PIC
   must notify the controlling authority as soon as possible.
   2.7.2. The controlling agency directing the diversion or rerouting is responsible for ensuring
   destination requirements or facilities are adequate for the aircraft and aircrew.
   2.7.3. The PIC will notify the controlling agency of any aircraft or aircrew limitations that
   may preclude diverting or rerouting the mission.

                          AIRCRAFT OPERATING GUIDELINES

4.1. Objectives. A fully mission capable aircraft is the ultimate objective of the logistics effort.
The final responsibility regarding equipment required for a mission rests with the PIC. If one
crew accepts an aircraft to operate a mission or mission segment without an item or system, this
acceptance does not commit that crew, or a different crew, to accept subsequent operations with
the same item or system inoperative. When the PIC considers an item essential, designate the
component Mission Essential on the aircraft maintenance forms, and the item will be repaired or
replaced prior to departure.
   4.1.1. The PIC is the approval authority for operations with degraded equipment within the
   guidelines of the aircraft Master Minimum Equipment List (MMEL). Operating outside of
   the aircraft MMEL guidelines requires Group/CC or COMAFSOF approval.                     For
   contingency operations, when communication issues prevent any possibility of a waiver
   request, the PIC is the approval authority operating outside the aircraft MMEL guidelines but
   must notify the chain of command of the situation as soon as conditions permit. Tactical
   missions fall outside the scope of MMEL and the PIC will ensure that equipment necessary
   for the mission being flown is operational in accordance with the Minimum Essential
   Subsystem List (MESL).
   4.1.2. One Time Flights. An aircraft may be released for a one time flight with a condition
   that might be hazardous for continued use provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to
   another station. A onetime flight is defined as a required flight to a final destination
   including required fuel stops.
       4.1.2.1. The Unit CC, chief of maintenance, MC, or deployed maintenance
       representative must authorize this release.
       4.1.2.2. The OG/CC or COMAFSOF must authorize the flight after maintenance has
       released the aircraft for flight operations.
       4.1.2.3. The maintenance release, OG/CC or COMAFSOF approval, and the PIC’s
       concurrence are all required before the aircraft can be flown to the specified repair
       destination.
4.2. Policy. If the PIC elects to operate with degraded equipment or aircraft systems, the PIC
will coordinate mission requirements (i.e., revised departure times, fuel requirements,
maintenance requirements, etc.) prior to flight with the mission control agency to ensure the
decision does not adversely impact follow-on missions. Reference the MMEL, MESL, and
Kinds of Equipment List for aircraft systems and equipment required for operations.
   4.2.1. Landing Gear System. If a landing gear malfunction is encountered, only a full stop
   landing will be made. The discrepancy will be corrected prior to the next flight.
       4.2.1.1. If repair capability does not exist and a positive determination is made that
       further flight can be accomplished with the gear down and locked, the aircraft may be
       flown to a destination where repair capability exists provided the gear is not moved from
       the down and locked position.

  4.2.2. Radar. Weather mode radar must be operative for flights into areas of known or
  forecast thunderstorms.
  4.2.3. Global Positioning System (GPS) Navigational Systems. Fly the PC-12 Trainer and
  U-28 in accordance with guidance in the Pilot’s Operating Handbook.
AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                  21

                                  AIRLAND OPERATIONS

5.1. Aircraft Maximum Operating Weight Policy. Operations above 10,450 pounds are
considered heavy weight operations, and apply to U-28 aircraft only. PC-12 Trainer aircraft are
restricted to a maximum takeoff weight of 10,450 pounds.
   5.1.1. Combat or contingency operations. U-28 Heavy Weight operations in support of
   combat or contingency operations are approved up to a maximum ramp weight of 10,979
   pounds and a max takeoff weight of 10,935 pounds during contingency or combat.
   Operations above 10,979 pounds require AFSOC/A3 approval.
   5.1.2. Training operations. U-28 Heavy weight operations during training must be approved
   by the OG/CC or COMAFSOF. Training operations above 10,979 pounds require additional
   AFSOC/A3 approval.
5.2. Checklists. Accomplish all checklists with strict discipline. A checklist is not complete
until all items have been accomplished.
   5.2.1. Each aircrew member will use the HQ AFSOC/A3V approved checklist for their duty
   position when conducting ground or flight operations.
   5.2.2. Aircrews may use approved checklists modified with notes, amplifying procedures,
   and limits provided the checklists and notes are current. Currency of notes is the crew
   member’s responsibility.
   5.2.3. Before Landing Checklists. Aircrew will complete the Before Landing Checklist no
   lower than 100 feet Above Ground Level (AGL). Aircraft will be established on final, wings
   level, with a controlled rate of descent in a position to execute a safe landing no lower than
   100 feet AGL.
5.3. Duty Station. All crew members will be at their duty stations during all takeoffs,
departures, approaches, and landings. During other phases of flight, crew members may leave
their duty stations to meet physiological needs and perform normal crew duties. Only one pilot
may be absent from their duty station at a time. Notify the crew prior to going off intercom.
   5.3.1. Pilot in-flight seat swaps may be accomplished only with a qualified pilot at the flight
   controls and above 1,000 feet AGL.
5.4. Takeoff and Landing Policy.
   5.4.1. The PIC will have access to a set of controls during all takeoffs and landings.
   5.4.2. A current and qualified Instructor Pilot (IP) may takeoff and land from either seat
   under any condition. During IP upgrade training, the IP trainee may takeoff and land from
   either seat under any condition.
   5.4.3. A certified semi prepared surface Mission Pilot or IP may takeoff or land from either
   seat during semi prepared surface operations.
   5.4.4. The PIC will land the aircraft during:
       5.4.4.1. Aircraft emergencies unless conditions prevent compliance.

      5.4.4.2. Missions with Distinguished Visitor (DV) 4 or higher on board the aircraft.
   5.4.5. Touch-down/Go-Around Point. The pilot flying the aircraft will verbally identify a
   touch-down and go-around point on all runways.
5.5. Landing Gear and Flap Operation.
   5.5.1. The pilot occupying the left seat will operate the landing gear. Actuate the landing
   gear upon command of the Pilot Flying (PF). Prior to actuation of the landing gear, the Pilot
   Not Flying (PNF) will acknowledge the PF command by repeating the command.
   5.5.2. The flaps should normally be actuated by the PF. However, the PF may direct the
   PNF to operate the flaps.
   5.5.3. When operating into an airfield where maintenance support is unavailable air crew can
   elect to leave the flaps in the take off position configuration, i.e., 15 flaps, instead of
   retracting them to zero.
5.6. Seat Belts and Cabin Occupants.
   5.6.1. All crew members will have a designated seat and restraint available. Crew members
   occupying a primary duty position will have lap belts fastened at all times. Shoulder harness
   and lap belts will be fastened for taxi, takeoff, and landing. EXCEPTION: Crew members
   performing specific duties may be away from their seat without restraints fastened during
   non-critical phases of flight.
   5.6.2. Provide a safety belt for all occupants over 2 years of age. Occupants will fasten seat
   belts securely when directed by the PIC, turbulence is encountered or anticipated, or in areas
   of forecast clear air turbulence.
   5.6.3. Floor loading is authorized to support dedicated special forces team members during
   contingencies, exercises, or training. The aircrew will attach a tie down strap for each row of
   personnel to provide forward restraint and body stability.
      5.6.3.1. Alternate restraints will be secured prior to takeoff and will not be removed until
      after landing unless required to meet physiological needs or perform mission related
      duties.
      5.6.3.2. Accomplish troop security by one of the following methods in descending order
      of preference:
          5.6.3.2.1. Seatbelts or snap links attached to tie-down rings on the cabin floor.
          5.6.3.2.2. Five thousand (5,000) pound tie-down straps.
   5.6.4. All cabin passengers must be seated with seat belts fastened during taxi, takeoff,
   approach, and landing.
   5.6.5. Passenger Policy. DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility, establishes criteria
   for passenger movement on DoD aircraft. AFI 11-401, AFSOC Sup 1, provides further
   guidance on orientation and public affairs travel. Refer to these publications directly. In all
   cases, passengers will be manifested on DD Form 2131, Passenger Manifest.
AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                  23


      5.6.5.1. During spouse orientation flights comply with AFI 11-401 and all supplements.
      Additionally threat reaction maneuvers are prohibited and spouses will not fly on the
      same aircraft.
      5.6.5.2. For other orientation categories, passengers will be seated with seatbelts fastened
      during threat maneuvers.
      5.6.5.3. Space-required. DoD 4515.13R lists several categories of passengers who are
      authorized official travel on DoD aircraft. Apply the space-available processing,
      approval, and restrictions to all space-required categories with the following exceptions:
          5.6.5.3.1. Supported Forces. A subcategory of space-required passenger defined by
          this instruction as U.S. and foreign military personnel who are an integral part of the
          mission being performed. Approval is assumed by the mission tasking. Manifest on
          DD Form 2131, Passenger Manifest.
              5.6.5.3.1.1. Restrictions. Both pilots must be fully qualified (unless specified
              otherwise by AFI 11401). Simulated emergency procedures (EP) are prohibited.
              There are no restrictions on mission events. Passengers will be seated and
              secured during threat maneuvers. The PIC will ensure supported forces are
              briefed on the mission profile and events before flight.
          5.6.5.3.2. Mission Essential Personnel. A sub-category of space-required passenger
          defined by AFI 11401, AFSOC Sup 1 and this instruction. Off-station travel is
          documented by travel orders. A letter of authorization from the group commander or
          COMAFSOF will document local flights.             Deployed squadron or mission
          commanders may approve squadron-assigned personnel, or maintenance personnel
          required for mission accomplishment. 18 FLTS/CC is the approval authority for
          supporting forces in conjunction with test missions. When frequent local flights are
          necessary, commanders may issue annual authorizations by name or AFSC, as
          appropriate. When using this option, the PIC will ensure that all restrictions in the
          following paragraph are complied with for each individual mission.
              5.6.5.3.2.1. Both pilots must be fully qualified (unless specified otherwise by AFI
              11401). Simulated EPs are prohibited. There are no restrictions on mission
              events. Passengers will be seated and secured during threat maneuvers. The PIC
              will ensure supporting forces are briefed on the mission profile and events before
              flight.
5.7. Aircraft Lighting. Operate aircraft lighting IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3, AFSOC Sup 1,
General Flight Rules, and AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground,
except when in compliance with contingency requirements or guidance.
   5.7.1. During NVG training operate in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 3, AFSOC Sup
   1, General Flight Rules.
   5.7.2. If Infrared (IR) covers are installed on any of the aircraft lighting systems, the PIC
   will verify that the other overt lighting systems are operable prior to takeoff.
5.8. Advisory Calls During Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) Operations. The following are
mandatory altitude calls made by the PNF:
   5.8.1. Non-precision Approaches.
 24                                                      AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012


       5.8.1.1. ―100 Above‖ when 100 feet above Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA) or step
       down altitude.
       5.8.1.2. ―Minimums‖ at MDA.
       5.8.1.3. ―Runway in sight‖ when the runway environment is in sight and the aircraft is in
       a position to execute a safe landing.
       5.8.1.4. ―Go-around‖ at the missed approach point or below MDA and the runway
       environment is not in sight, when the aircraft is not in a position to execute a safe
       landing, when directed by ATC facility, or conditions on the runway will not allow a safe
       landing (e.g., personnel, equipment, or aircraft on the runway).
   5.8.2. Precision Approaches.
       5.8.2.1. ―100 Above‖ when 100 feet above final approach altitude, glideslope intercept
       altitude, or Decision Height (DH).
       5.8.2.2. ―Continue‖ at DH with approach light system visible and the aircraft in a
       position to execute a safe landing. Do not continue the approach below 100 feet if usable
       runway visual cues are not present.
       5.8.2.3. ―Land‖ at DH with the runway environment in sight and the aircraft in a position
       to execute a safe landing.
       5.8.2.4. ―Goaround‖ at or below DH and the runway environment is not in sight or if the
       aircraft is not in a position to execute a safe landing, when directed by ATC facility, or
       conditions on the runway will not allow a safe landing (e.g., personnel, equipment, or
       aircraft on the runway).
   5.8.3. Climb/Descent.
       5.8.3.1. ―1,000 feet above/below‖ assigned altitude or flight level.
   5.8.4. Altimeter settings. Both pilots will state and set the altimeter setting as issued by
   ATC, weather reporting facilities (e.g., Automatic Terminal Information System (ATIS),
   Automated Weather Observation System, Automated Surface Observation System, etc.), or
   when passing a Transition Level or Altitude (e.g. Flight Level 180).
   5.8.5. Deviations:
       5.8.5.1. Any crew member will immediately advise the PF when observing unannounced
       heading deviations greater than 10 degrees, airspeed deviations of 10 knots, altitude
       deviations of 100 feet during approach or 200 feet while en route, or potential terrain or
       obstruction problems and no attempt is being made to correct the deviation.
       5.8.5.2. Any aircrew member will announce deviations from prescribed procedures for
       the approach being flown to the PF when no attempt is being made to correct the
       deviation.
5.9. Communications Policy. The aircrew will determine communication requirements during
mission planning.     Ensure all mission frequencies, cryptological data, mission radio
configuration, and mission radio monitoring responsibilities are outlined during the preflight
briefing.
AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                      25


   5.9.1. Classified interphone or radio transmissions can be recorded on the cockpit voice
   recorder (CVR), if installed, and operating. Ensure only authorized personnel have access to
   a CVR that contains classified conversations.
5.10. Wind Limits. Comply with the POH maximum demonstrated crosswind for takeoff and
landing for the given flap configuration. When landing with gusty winds and increased approach
speed, the deck angle of the aircraft will be lower, PIC will exercise caution when landing to
prevent nose-wheel first landings or propeller contact on touchdown.
5.11. Wake Turbulence and Wind Shear Avoidance.
   5.11.1. The PIC will exercise caution when conducting taxi or flight operations within the
   vicinity of helicopter(s) or tilt-rotor aircraft. In a slow hover-taxi or stationary hover near the
   surface, helicopter main rotor(s) or tilt-rotor aircraft produce high velocity downwash
   vortices out to a distance approximately three times the diameter of the rotor. In forward
   flight, departing or landing helicopters or tilt rotor aircraft produce a pair of strong, high-
   speed trailing vortices similar to wing tip vortices of larger fixed-wing aircraft.
   5.11.2. When landing behind a fixed-wing aircraft, the following rules will be followed.
       5.11.2.1. Maintain two minute spacing behind small aircraft (12,501 - 41,000 pounds)
       5.11.2.2. Maintain three minute spacing behind large and heavy aircraft (greater than
       41,000 pounds)
       5.11.2.3. No spacing is required behind like aircraft or aircraft weighing less than 12,500
       pounds.
   5.11.3. When departing after a fixed wing aircraft has just departed, the PIC must ensure
   rotation is prior to the larger aircraft’s point of rotation AND the aircraft will not enter the
   climb profile of the leading aircraft. If either of these cannot be met, the PIC will follow the
   timing rules in 5.11.2.
   5.11.4. When departing after a fixed-wing aircraft has just landed, the PIC must ensure his
   rotation point is after the larger aircraft’s touch down point.
   5.11.5. Reference to AFMAN 11-217 Volume 3, Supplemental Flight Information, for
   additional wake turbulence information and wake turbulence avoidance techniques. A
   reliable timing source will be used to ensure appropriate separation is achieved.
   5.11.6. Wind shear is any rapid change in wind direction or speed. Wind shear at low
   altitudes and slow airspeeds are the most dangerous. Pilots should look for airspeed changes
   of greater than 15 knots or vertical speed changes of more than 500 feet per minute, both of
   which indicate a possible wind shear condition. Below 100 feet in an approach, if indicated
   airspeed and expected ground speed are more than 15 knots different, pilots should consider
   initiating a go-around.    WARNING: Wind can affect the path and duration of wake
   turbulence thereby prolonging the turbulence hazard or placing the turbulence in an
   unanticipated location. The PF is expected to adjust aircraft operations and flight path as
   necessary to preclude serious wake encounters.
5.12. LZ and LZ Markings.
26                                                     AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012


  5.12.1. It is the responsibility of all aircrew and/or ground personnel to notify the Point Of
  Contact for the unit LZ survey program, in a timely manner, of any changes or discrepancies
  on existing surveys.
  5.12.2. A thorough review of the LZ survey and accompanying photographs, computer
  drawings, or imagery will be accomplished by all crew members during the aircrew brief.
  The PIC is responsible for ensuring that any crew member unable to attend the brief either
  reviews the landing zone survey or is briefed on the hazards associated with the LZ.
  5.12.3. Aircrews may conduct airland operations at airfields specified in the ASRR/ZAR.
  5.12.4. Tactical LZ surveys may be used during exercises and operational missions when a
  full LZ survey is unavailable due to the situation. Requests to use tactical surveys will be
  forwarded to OG/CC or COMAFSOF for review and approval.
  5.12.5. The OG/CC or COMAFSOF may approve the use of other DoD services or host
  nation equivalent LZ surveys.
  5.12.6. Refer to AFI 13-217, AFSOC Sup 1, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Procedures, for
  LZ marking descriptions. The overt and covert markings and signals to be used during LZ
  operations will be established during mission planning and included in the aircrew briefing.
     5.12.6.1. Aircrews may land at an LZ marked with any Airfield Marking Patterns (AMP)
     configuration IAW AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Procedures, or this
     instruction provided the pilots define an identifiable go-around point (e.g., visual
     point/location, timing past intended landing point, etc.) prior to landing. Overt or covert
     markings may be used to define a LZ.
     5.12.6.2. Aircrews will define an identifiable touchdown and go-around point on all
     runways and LZs.
AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012                                                           27


Figure 5.1. AMP-3 (Box and One) Configuration.




NOTE: Figure depicts AMP-3 configuration.
5.13. Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) Requirements. ARFF requirements at non-
USAF active or flying installations are as follows:
   5.13.1. During contingency LZ usage, up to eight takeoffs and landings within four
   consecutive days may be accomplished at a LZ or airfield without ARFF equipment or local
   established procedures in the event of an aircraft incident or accident. OG/CC or
   COMAFSOF is waiver authority for flight operations at locations not possessing ARFF
   capabilities or local procedures.
   5.13.2. Refer to AFPAM 32-2004, Aircraft Fire Protection for Exercises and Contingency
   Response Operations, to calculate ARFF requirements. Non-USAF ARFF vehicles may be
   used if the agent and pumping capabilities are equivalent.
   5.13.3. Waivers to the ARFF requirements will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
   Required information for waiver request can be found in AFPAM 32-2004, Aircraft Fire
   Protection for Exercises and Contingency Response Operations.
   5.13.4. Squadron commanders may authorize operations at training LZs and local airfields
   that do not possess local ARFF services.

5.14. Runway and Taxiway Requirements. Use normal takeoff and landing procedures
whenever practical. For mission accomplishment, if approach end overruns are available and
stressed or authorized for normal operations, the overruns may be used to increase the runway
available for takeoff. Base all aircraft performance requirements on actual or predicted
environmental conditions (e.g., pressure altitude, temperature, aircraft weight, runway surface
conditions, etc.).
   5.14.1. Taxiway width. Minimum width for all operations is 23 feet.
   5.14.2. Runway width. Minimum width for all operations is 30 feet.
   5.14.3. Normal Operations:
       5.14.3.1. Takeoff and landing. Minimum runway length is Accelerate-Stop Distance
       corrected for environmental conditions and flap setting.
       5.14.3.2. Touch-and-go operations. Minimum runway length is 5,000 feet for full and
       partial flap landings and 6,000 feet for no-flap landings.
       5.14.3.3. Stop-and-go operations. Available runway distance remaining after stopping
       the aircraft will be at least Accelerate-Stop Distance corrected for environmental
       conditions and flap setting. If the runway remaining is less, taxi the aircraft to achieve
       Accelerate-Stop Distance.
       5.14.3.4. Precision landings. Any pilot may perform precision landings to a minimum
       touchdown zone of 30 feet wide by 200 feet long. WARNING: Aircraft performance is
       based upon rotating and climbing on criteria outlined in the POH. Failure to maintain
       aircraft performance criteria may not allow for safe clearance of obstacles.
   5.14.4. NVG Landings:
       5.14.4.1. NVG AMP-3 landings can be performed by any pilot qualified to perform
       NVG landings. AMP-3 landings will have a minimum touchdown zone of 30 feet wide
       by 200 feet long, and the runway length will be at least Accelerate-Stop Distance.
       5.14.4.2. NVG AMP-4 landings can be performed by any pilot qualified to perform
       NVG landings. AMP-4 landings will have a clearly defined intended point of landing
       and the runway length will be at least Accelerate-Stop Distance.
       5.14.4.3. A STS controller (or qualified equivalent) or an active control tower is required
       to conduct NVG landings at unlit or covertly marked landing zones or airfields.
   5.14.5. Semi prepared surface operations:
       5.14.5.1. Only semi prepared surface certified pilots may perform semiprepared surface
       operations.
       5.14.5.2. Pilots will only perform stop-and-go or full stop landings on semiprepared
       surfaces. Reference the POH for aircraft performance on semi-prepared surfaces.
5.15. Aircraft Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria. In addition to the requirements of
AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground, comply with the following:
   5.15.1. Without wing walkers, avoid taxi obstructions by at least 25 feet. With wing
   walkers, avoid taxi obstructions by at least 10 feet. EXCEPTION: When operating at a
AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                     29


   civilian airport and taxiing on a Fixed Based Operator (FBO) ramp, the PIC may taxi the
   aircraft within 25 feet of obstacles or other aircraft without wing walkers when using marked
   taxi routes. The PIC will comply with marshaller instructions. Taxi routes must be used by
   similar types of aircraft for which the routes were designed and in specifically designed
   parking spots. Support equipment shall be located in appropriately designated areas.
   5.15.2. Do not taxi aircraft closer than 10 feet to any obstacle.
   5.15.3. When taxi clearance is doubtful, use a wing walker. If wing walkers are unavailable
   or if provided and doubt still exists as to proper clearance, deplane a crew member to
   maintain obstruction clearance.
5.16. Reverse Taxi. CAUTION: Using brakes to stop the aircraft while reverse taxiing may
result in aircraft empennage contacting the ground.
   5.16.1. The pilot performing reverse taxi operations will coordinate reverse taxi directions
   and signals to be used with the marshaller (if applicable) prior to commencing reverse taxi
   operations. Exercise vigilance if reverse taxi is accomplished without a marshaller.
   5.16.2. During night reverse taxi operations, the pilot will ensure visibility in the taxi area is
   sufficient to conduct safe taxi operations.
   5.16.3. Stop no less than 25 feet from an obstruction even if using a wing walker.
5.17. Takeoff and Landing Obstruction Clearance Criteria.
   5.17.1. For a LZ to be suitable for operations, the LZ must meet the following obstacle
   clearance criteria listed below.
      5.17.1.1. Zone A. Within 35 feet either side of runway centerline (excluding the runway
      or taxiway), obstacles will not be higher than 12 inches.
      5.17.1.2. Zone B. Within 40 feet either side of runway centerline (excluding the runway
      or taxiway), obstacles will not be higher than 60 inches.
      5.17.1.3. Approach Zone. No obstructions higher than 1 foot for every 35 feet (35:1) in
      the approach zone.
      5.17.1.4. Clear Zone: Minimum of 500 feet.
      5.17.1.5. Lateral Obstruction Clearance

Figure 5.3. Zone B Calculation.




       5.17.1.6. For semiprepared surface taxiways and runways, obstacles will not be higher
       than two inches unless AFM, POH, or aircraft addendum to this instruction is more
       restrictive.
   5.17.2. Reference AFI 13-217, AFSOC Sup 1, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Procedures, for
   additional information on LZ criteria for shoulders, graded areas, transitional area, clear and
   approach zones.

Figure 5.4. LZ Lateral Criteria (not to scale).




Figure 5.5. LZ Obstacle Height Criteria (not to scale).




5.18. Operations Over Arresting Cables:
   5.18.1. Avoid landing on non-recessed arresting cables.
AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                    31


   5.18.2. Avoid rolling over arresting cables at speeds greater than a brisk walk during taxi,
   takeoff, or landing to preclude damage to bottom of aircraft. Maintain appropriate
   backpressure on aircraft yoke to reduce nose landing gear down force if inadvertently
   crossing an arresting cable at high speed.
5.19. Aircraft Recovery from Unprepared Surfaces. Aircrews should not attempt to recover
an aircraft after inadvertent entry onto surfaces that are not suitable for taxi. Ground crews using
appropriate equipment will normally recover the aircraft. Aircrews may recover the aircraft at
austere locations if, after thorough inspection, the PIC is sure there is no aircraft damage and the
surface will support the aircraft.
5.20. Inter. Normally, initiate takeoffs from the beginning of the runway. The decision to make
intersection takeoffs rests solely with the aircraft commander. Base TOLD card computations on
the runway remaining at the point the takeoff is initiated.
5.21. Reduced Power Operations. Reduced power operations are not authorized during
takeoff and initial climb.
5.22. Engines Running Onload or Offload (ERO).
   5.22.1. ERO procedures will be conducted in accordance with the POH. An ERO will only
   be run for operational necessity or aircrew proficiency. The appropriate POH checklists will
   be run anytime an aircraft door is open with the engines running.
5.23. Declared Distances.
   5.23.1. Declared distances are normally associated with airports affected by close-in
   development, or encroachment, and are annotated on aerodrome sketch portion of the
   approach plate with a black square with a white ―D.‖ Four terms are associated with
   declared distances: TORA: Take-off Run available; TODA: Take-off distance available;
   ASDA: Accelerate-stop distance available; LDA: Landing distance available. See AFMAN
   11-217 V1 for more details.
   5.23.2. For normal takeoff, both the actual runway length and the declared ASDA must be
   greater than computed Accelerate-Stop Distance. The declared TORA must be greater than
   the computed Takeoff Ground Roll.
   5.23.3. For a normal landing, the actual runway length, the declared ASDA, and the declared
   LDA must be greater than computed Accelerate-Stop Distance.
   5.23.4. For touch-and-go operations, the actual runway length, declared ASDA, TORA and
   LDA must all be greater than 5,000 feet (6,000 feet for no-flap touch-and-gos).
5.24. Approved Instrument Procedures.
   5.24.1. The PIC will not fly an instrument approach or departure at an airfield unless the
   procedure has been TERPS reviewed and approved by AFSOC or another MAJCOM and is
   valid for the date used. Approved procedures can be checked on Global Decision Support
   System 2 (GDSS2).

                         GENERAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

Section 6A—Pre-Mission

6.1. Aircrew Uniforms.
   6.1.1. On all missions, wear the aircrew uniform and other flying clothing/equipment in
   accordance with AFI 11-301, Volume 1, AFSOC Sup 1, Aircrew Life Support Program and
   AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel, or as directed for
   mission requirements.
   6.1.2. If the wear of civilian clothing is authorized by the Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG) or
   a combatant commander or his delegated authority, Aircrews may wear conservatively styled
   civilian clothing when required for mission or operational requirements (e.g., Foreign
   Clearance Guide (FCG)) and approved by the unit commander. Civilian clothing worn will
   consist of casual slacks or cargo pants, collared shirts, shoes or hiking boots. Denim jeans,
   T-shirts, or clothing predominately made from non-cotton materials are not authorized.
   When wearing civilian clothes, aircrew will comply with all requirements of paragraph 6.2.
6.2. Personal and Professional Equipment.
   6.2.1. Passports. Carry passports on missions when required by the FCG.

6.3. Survival and Protective Equipment. The unit will establish minimum survival and
protective equipment to be worn or carried on a crew member’s person for contingency or
combat operations. All personnel will wear the survival and protective equipment provided
during hostile environment operations.
   6.3.1. When conducting overwater flights beyond power off gliding distance from land, the
   Unit CC, MC, and PIC should consider the following factors:
      6.3.1.1. Climate zone, water temperature, and existing weather throughout range and
      route of proposed flight.
      6.3.1.2. Operational requirements (e.g., fuel requirements from an Equal Time Point
      (ETP) at an altitude not requiring oxygen, glide procedures, number of aircrew, use
      supplemental oxygen, etc.).
      6.3.1.3. Number, type, and communications capabilities of aircraft in nonstandard
      formation (if applicable).
      6.3.1.4. Time of flight and range over water beyond power off gliding distance with
      engine inoperative.
      6.3.1.5. Location, availability, and capability of Search And Rescue (SAR) forces. Alert
      status and flying time from alert staging location of SAR aircraft (e.g., MC-130E/H/P,
      HC-130, US Coast Guard) to overwater route of flight.
      6.3.1.6. Anticipated time in water prior to rescue by SAR or commercial systems (e.g.,
      cargo or fishing vessels, military or SAR ships).
      6.3.1.7. Winds, wave height, and their impact on SAR or commercial systems.
      6.3.1.8. Aircraft and ground communications ranges and capabilities, commercial
      shipping lanes, and air corridors transited by military aircraft and commercial air carriers.
      6.3.1.9. The PIC and MC will ensure all aircrew are briefed on and review aircraft
      ditching, water survival, and rescue signaling procedures.
   6.3.2. After careful study and analysis of the preceding factors compared to proposed flight
   routing, the OG/CC or COMAFSOF may allow flight operations without additional flight
   support (i.e., C-130 support for ―duck butt‖ operations) for inter-theater or intra-theater
   operations. The Unit CC may request additional flight support operations when risk factors
   or analysis deem necessary.
      6.3.2.1. Single ship, single engine aircraft overwater flights beyond power off gliding
      distance from land will inform OG/CC or COMAFSOF and the HQ AFSOC/A3 of
      proposed operations, routing, and risk mitigation factors prior to commencing overwater
      operations without additional flight support.
6.4. Aircrew Publication Requirements.
   6.4.1. Aircrew will maintain the unclassified publications specified in the Flight Crew
   Information Summary. This requirement may be satisfied if fully posted publications are
 34                                                        AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012


   kept on board the aircraft. Publications will include all applicable AFSOC, Wing, Group, or
   Squadron Supplements (imbedded in parent regulation/instruction or stand alone). Home-
   station airfield and operations group publications are required for operations that originate
   from their station.

applicable items before flights outside the CONUS. Comply with Customs, Immigration,
Agriculture, Immunization, and quarantine requirements. The unit dispatching the mission is
responsible for border clearance and other special clearances when required. Entry into foreign
countries by personnel and equipment is directed by military agreements, diplomatic agreements,
directives of the operational control commander, International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO) standards, and the FCG.

Section 6B—Pre-departure

6.12. Briefing Requirements. Briefings should be clear, concise, and designed to provide
mission essential information. Use briefing guides in AFI 11-2U-28V3_CL1. The PIC will
ensure their crews receive a briefing, prior to each mission, covering all specific areas to be
accomplished.
   6.12.1. If critical pre-mission duties conflict with the briefing, the PIC may excuse crew
   members. Prior to engine start, the PIC will give a mission brief to any excused crew
   members detailing all areas pertinent to their duties.
   6.12.2. The PIC will brief the following factors:
       6.12.2.1. Weather. Determine recent weather and its effect on the takeoff, mission, and
       landing areas. Wind will be evaluated by the aircrew for its effect.
       6.12.2.2. TOLD. Compute and brief applicable TOLD and power requirements for
       mission, airfield, or LZ operations.
       6.12.2.3. Approach and Departure. Brief the planned approach and departure routes as
       well as significant terrain features.
       6.12.2.4. Airfield/LZ dimensions and surface conditions.
       6.12.2.5. Abort criteria. Brief abort considerations to include the takeoff and landing
       commitment points and engine failure after rotation options and intentions.
AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                   37


       6.12.2.6. Other Hazards. Known personnel and equipment locations will be briefed. If
       other aircraft, vehicles or personnel are operating in the area, attempt to determine their
       affect on the LZ, taxi routes, or aircraft parking area. Brief any other special
       considerations such as parking locations, onload/offload procedures, fueling locations,
       equipment and procedures, etc.
   6.12.3. Passenger Briefings (if applicable).
       6.12.3.1. Prior to each flight with passengers on board, the PIC will ensure that a briefing
       has been conducted. When more than one flight is accomplished by the same crew and
       passengers, subsequent briefings are not required, except to brief route information,
       mission changes, etc.
       6.12.3.2. The passenger briefing will include demonstration of seat belt, emergency
       oxygen, fire extinguishing systems, and location/operation of normal and emergency
       exits. All overwater flights will include a briefing on personal and aircraft life support
       equipment.
6.13. FCIF. Review Volume I, Part A, of the FCIF before all missions.
   6.13.1. Update FCIF Currency Record and Squadron read file, if new material has been
   added to the FCIF since the last review. Legibly enter the last FCIF item number, the current
   date, and initial the FCIF Currency Record or complete required electronic review
   procedures if FCIF is stored electronically (e.g., Patriot Excalibur). When unable to sign the
   FCIF Currency Record or complete electronic FCIF review procedures, initialing and
   numbering the latest FCIF by an individual’s name on the flight authorization orders certifies
   the FCIF Currency review of all items is complete. During deployed operations or
   contingencies, mission planning crews will maintain a hard copy of home station and
   MAJCOM FCIFs for aircrew review.
   6.13.2. PIC will ensure any crew members joining a mission en route receive an FCIF
   update. Instructor pilots who fly with senior officers are responsible for briefing FCIF items.
   6.13.3. Crew members not assigned or attached to the squadron will certify FCIF review by
   entering the last FCIF number and their initials next to their name on the file copy of the
   flight authorization orders.
6.14. Flight Planning Systems. The primary flight/mission planning system is the Special
Operations Forces Planning and Rehearsal System (SOFPARS). SOFPARS is a subset of the
Air Force Mission Support System that includes the Portable Flight Planning Software and the
Joint Mission Planning System. Upgraded or new versions of SOFPARS and PC-12/U-28
Virtual Mission Planning System will be released and authorized by the HQ AFSOC/A3 for use
after applicable testing has been completed.
   6.14.1. Electronic Data Transfer. If the flight planning computer transfers a flight plan to the
   aircraft electronically, it must be an AFSOC approved system. HQ AFSOC/A3 will
   periodically publish a listing of approved systems. Aircrews will not use unapproved
   versions of any system to load aircraft avionics without HQ AFSOC/A3 approval.
6.15. Coordinates. The following procedures will be used: NOTE: Aircrew will confirm a
common datum with their mission users during the mission planning process. Failure to plan
navigation to LZ or mission areas using a common datum may result in errors of up to several
 38                                                     AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012


miles. Computer based mission planning systems and aircraft navigational systems generally use
WGS84 as reference datum. Attempt to use WGS84 whenever possible to minimize confusion.
   6.15.1. When reporting or receiving positions using coordinates derived from maps, charts,
   or related cartographic products, a complete reference to the source of the coordinates will be
   provided. This reference will include the datum map or chart producer, series, sheet number,
   edition and date.
   6.15.2. When reporting or receiving positions using coordinates derived from non-
   cartographic sources such as GPS receivers, Analytical Photogrammetric Positioning
   Systems, or related systems, a complete reference to the source of the coordinates will be
   provided. This reference will include the datum, method used to derive the coordinates,
   agency producing the coordinates, and accuracy of the coordinates.
6.16. Flight Logs. Prepare a flight log for each off-station mission and include the following as
a minimum: turn points, headings, distances, estimated time en route (ETE), Minimum Safe
Altitude (MSA), and fuel computations. A flight log is not required if the above information is
included on a flight map.
   6.16.1. A flight log is not required for local training flights or when mission requirements
   are unknown such as during an alert status.
6.17. Weather Planning. Comply with AFI 11-202, Volume 3, AFSOC Sup 1, General Flight
Rules, weather minimums unless local or theater specific weather minimums are more restrictive.
   6.17.1. Thunderstorms. Do not fly above (within 2,000 ft) thunderstorms or cumulonimbus
   clouds.
       6.17.1.1. If unable to vertically clear thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds, by at least
       2,000 ft:
       6.17.1.2. Avoid thunderstorms by 20 NM at or above FL 230.
       6.17.1.3. Avoid thunderstorms by 10 NM below FL 230.
       6.17.1.4. Avoid thunderstorms by 5 NM for combat operations below FL 280, if mission
       requirements dictate.
   6.17.2. Avoid gust fronts and winds preceding a rapidly moving thunderstorm. CAUTION:
   Aircraft damage may occur 20 NM or more from any thunderstorm. Aircrews must
   familiarize themselves with information on thunderstorm development and hazards.
   6.17.3. Aircrews should avoid flying in areas of recently dissipated thunderstorms and
   advected clouds (horizontal movement of clouds caused by wind) downwind of
   thunderstorms.
   6.17.4. In order to minimize exposure to thunderstorm hazards when approaching or
   departing an airport in an area where thunderstorms are occurring or are forecast:
       6.17.4.1. Attempt to maintain visual meteorological conditions (VMC).
       6.17.4.2. Maintain at least 5 NM separation from heavy rain showers
       6.17.4.3. Avoid areas of high lightning potential. NOTE: Approaches or departures
       may be accomplished when thunderstorms are within 10 NM providing they are not
AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                        39


       producing any hazardous conditions (such as hail, lightning, strong winds, gusts fronts,
       heavy rain, wind shear, or microburst) at the airport, and are not forecast or observed to
       be moving in the direction of the route of flight (to include the planned missed approach
       corridor, if applicable).
6.18. Lunar Illumination. WARNING: NVGs worn during flights with illumination less than
10%, (―black hole‖ conditions) can lead to induced motion illusions and spatial disorientation.
   6.18.1. Any mission planned when the lunar illumination is forecast to be less than 10%
   during any portion of the mission will require an additional level of Operational Risk
   Management. If a tactical approach using NVGs is to be accomplished when the
   illumination is below 10%, the aircraft commander must receive permission from the
   Operations Officer or Commander.
6.19. Fuel Planning. Use criteria outlined in AFI 11-202, Volume 3, AFSOC Sup 1, General
Flight Rules. Aircrews will conduct appropriate in-flight planning to ensure proper fuel
management. Reference Attachment 2 for ETP discussion and calculations.
   6.19.1. Plan to arrive in the terminal area of the destination or alternate (if required) with:
       6.19.1.1. 300 pounds of fuel remaining.
       6.19.1.2. When two alternates are required, flight plan to the most distant alternate.
   6.19.2. Land with no less than 200 pounds of fuel on board.
       6.19.2.1. Minimum Fuel is 200 pounds and Emergency Fuel is 150 pounds.
       6.19.2.2. Pilots will declare ―Minimum Fuel‖ or ―Emergency Fuel‖ to ATC when, in
       their judgment, the aircraft may land at the intended destination with less than the
       minimum/emergency fuel reserve.
   6.19.3. Plan to consume 100 pounds per instrument approach to be flown.
   6.19.4. Plan an additional 15 minutes of fuel per hour at maximum cruise power fuel
   consumption rate for that portion of the flight where structural icing or thunderstorms
   requiring off-course maneuvering are forecast or reported.
   6.19.5. Cruise at the altitude that gives the best ground distance traveled for each pound of
   fuel consumed. As a rule of thumb, climb if ground speed is reduced less than 5 knots for
   each 1,000 feet of altitude increase. Descend if ground speed will increase more than 5 knots
   for each 1,000 feet of altitude decrease.
   6.19.6. Pilots will plan fuel consumption rates at long range cruise power settings. Plan to
   fly transition legs at Long Range Cruise power settings in an effort to conserve fuel. If
   maximum cruise power setting is to be used for mission accomplishment, pilots will plan fuel
   consumption rates at this power setting.
6.20. Objective Area Planning.
   6.20.1. Map Selection. Maps with a scale of 1:500,000 or greater detail are required for
   objective area operations. Maps with a scale of 1:250,000 or greater are highly desired.
   6.20.2. Pilots will ensure all maps used for flight have the most current hazards posted.
   Aircrew will also ensure appropriate civil airspace is annotated along their route of flight.
 40                                                       AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012


   6.20.3. Emergency Safe Altitude (ESA). An ESA is an altitude that will provide positive
   terrain clearance should Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) be encountered. Use
   1,000 feet (2,000 feet in mountainous terrain) above the highest obstacle or terrain feature
   within 10 NM of the intended flight path/objective area. An ESA will be computed for all
   objective areas. NOTE: Mountainous areas are defined as having a 500 foot change in
   surface altitude over ½ NM. For operations outside of the CONUS, reference AFI 11-
   202V3, AFSOC Sup 1.
   6.20.4. Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA). An MSA is an altitude that provides Visual
   Meteorological Conditions (VMC) terrain clearance and limited threat avoidance during
   degraded aircrew situational awareness or periods of task saturation. Use 500 feet above the
   highest obstacle or terrain feature within 5 NM of the intended flight path/objective area. An
   MSA will be computed for all objective areas. WARNING: Failure to maintain an accurate
   altimeter setting during flight may cause lower than planned terrain clearances or impact with
   terrain when using the computed ESA/MSA.
6.21. Flight Plans. If aircrews file with the FAA and their destination is a military installation,
aircrews must notify the destination base operations prior to departure or once airborne, via the
appropriate FAA Flight Service Station, of the planned time of arrival.
6.22. Aircraft Performance.
   6.22.1. Weight and Balance. Weight and balance will be computed using the POH,
   equivalent electronic program, or vector template. A copy of each mission’s weight and
   balance will be maintained at the squadron or operations center (as applicable) and carried
   with the aircrew. For en route stops, weight and balance need not be recomputed provided
   the zero fuel weight has not changed. The crew will compute in-flight crew and passenger
   equipment movement to ensure Center of Gravity limits are not exceeded. These
   computations will be briefed during the crew or mission brief or during flight, as required.
   6.22.2. TOLD. Compute TOLD using the POH performance data charts or approved
   electronic equivalent. Compute TOLD for initial takeoff prior to engine start. Recompute
   data for pressure altitude changes of 500 feet, temperature changes of 5 degrees Celsius, or
   gross weight changes of 500 lbs.

Section 6C—Preflight

6.23. Aircraft Maintenance Forms.
   6.23.1. Review the aircraft maintenance forms before applying power to the aircraft or
   operating aircraft systems.
   6.23.2. Ensure that the USAF fuel card and/or other authorized method of payment are
   aboard the aircraft. The Air Card is used to pay for services such as aviation fuel, aircraft oil
   and fluids, minor maintenance items, landing fees, aircraft deicing, follow-me trucks, and
   other airfield related services at commercial FBO locations. The PIC is responsible for
   ensuring the receipt is correct and all appropriate signatures are obtained before departing the
   military base, airport, or FBO. The PIC is responsible for turning in all service receipts to
   maintenance upon return to home station. If services do not generate a receipt, the PIC will
   ensure the location and services performed are noted and relayed to maintenance.
AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                      41


   6.23.3. The exceptional release must be signed before flight. A maintenance officer,
   maintenance superintendent, or authorized contract civilian will sign the exceptional release.
   If one of these individuals is not available, the PIC may sign the exceptional release.
   6.23.4. Ensure that aircraft locking keys are in aircraft maintenance forms prior to takeoff.
   6.23.5. Ensure the aircraft protective covers are on board aircraft prior to flight.
6.24. Aircraft Inspections.
   6.24.1. Aircraft inspection will be accomplished by the PIC or person designated by the PIC.
   6.24.2. Face-to-face turnovers between crew members are acceptable.
   6.24.3. During higher headquarters directed exercises or contingency operations, any
   qualified aircrew may accomplish the preflight inspection and brief the oncoming aircrew.
   6.24.4. Required Equipment. The final responsibility regarding equipment required for a
   mission rests with the PIC. If one PIC accepts an aircraft to operate a mission or mission
   segment without an item or system, this acceptance does not commit that PIC, or a different
   PIC, to subsequent operations with the same item or system inoperative. If the PIC elects to
   operate with degraded equipment or aircraft systems, coordinate mission requirements prior
   to flight with the mission control agency to ensure the decision does not adversely impact
   follow-on missions.
6.25. Alert Aircraft Procedures. To accept an aircraft on alert, complete a normal aircraft
preflight. After 72 hours on alert, allow maintenance personnel access to inspect the aircraft.
   6.25.1. Parking. Park the alert aircraft in a designated alert parking area to expedite taxi and
   takeoff.
   6.25.2. Climatic Protective Facilities. During periods of extreme cold, hot, or severe
   weather, every effort should be made to shelter alert aircraft and essential equipment in a
   hangar to ensure operational readiness in the event of a mission.
   6.25.3. Flying Alert Aircraft. The alert aircraft may be flown for purposes other than actual
   alert missions provided the following conditions are complied with:
       6.25.3.1. Ensure sufficient fuel remains on board to meet mission requirements. If not,
       upon flight completion, refuel the aircraft to required alert fuel quantity.
       6.25.3.2. Communication contact is maintained with the primary controlling agencies.
       6.25.3.3. A qualified aircrew for the alert mission is on board.
       6.25.3.4. Controlling agencies are notified any time the alert aircraft departs the local
       area.
   6.25.4. Once accepted for alert, the alert aircrew will make an entry in the aircraft
   maintenance forms, stating, "Aircraft accepted on alert at _____, _____." (local time and
   date). No maintenance may be performed on it without prior approval of the alert crew PIC
   and notification of the squadron director of operations (DO) or deployed MC. To ensure
   integrity of the aircrew preflight, an alert crew member must be present whenever
   maintenance is performed, or at the completion of the maintenance, the aircrew is required to
 42                                                     AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012


   check the area in which maintenance was performed. The check should be performed as
   soon as practical after the maintenance and must be performed prior to flight.
6.26. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations.
   6.26.1. Pilots are allowed to add engine oil, if needed, at austere locations or at stations
   without maintenance support. At military bases, coordinate with local base operations
   representatives on procedures for servicing the aircraft while the aircrew is not present.
   6.26.2. Aircrew/Maintenance Engine Runs. Mixed aircrew/maintenance engine runs should
   not normally be accomplished. If conducted, the appropriate POH or maintenance inspection
   procedures will be used.
6.27. Life Support and Oxygen Requirements.
   6.27.1. Upon reporting to the aircraft, the PIC or designated representative will ensure
   sufficient quantities of appropriate serviceable life support, survival equipment, and
   protective clothing for the entire mission are aboard the aircraft. Verify Air Force Technical
   Order (AFTO) Form 46, Prepositioned Life Support Equipment, prior to departing home
   station. Life support equipment and medical kits weighing less than 200 lbs may be secured
   with seat belts.
   6.27.2. Aircrew members will wear Life Preserver Units on all overwater flights when route
   of flight is beyond power off gliding distance from land. Life Preserver Units will be
   available for crew use anytime the route of flight is over water. Passengers will have life
   preservers available and will be worn at the discretion of the PIC. EXCEPTION: Life
   Preserver Units are not required when on approach or departure.
   6.27.3. Life rafts will be available to accommodate all personnel on board. Life rafts are not
   required when overwater flight occurs during instrument approach procedures under ATC
   control, immediately after takeoff, and before landing.
   6.27.4. Anti-exposure suits for the aircrew and passengers will be on board during any
   preplanned overwater flights which are beyond power off gliding distance from land and the
   water temperature is 60° Fahrenheit (F) (16° Celsius (C)) or less. The anti-exposure suits
   will be worn by pilots on flights which are beyond power off gliding distance from land and
   the water temperature is 60°F (16°C) or less. EXCEPTION: Anti-exposure suits are not
   required when on approach or departure.
   6.27.5. Oxygen requirements are outlined in AFI 11-202, Volume 3, AFSOC Sup 1, General
   Flight Rules. Crew members occupying a primary crew station will accomplish an
   operations check of their oxygen masks prior to flight. The oxygen mask will remain
   connected and readily available for use before engine start until after engine shutdown. An
   oxygen mask will be available for all aircraft occupants.
6.28. In-flight Meals. The pilots will not consume in-flight meals within 1½ hours of each
other during flight if the meals were procured from the same source and consist of the same
menu.
6.29. Cockpit Congestion and Loose Objects.
   6.29.1. The flight deck area will be kept as uncluttered and orderly as possible for all flight
   and ground operations. Specifically:
AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                     43


       6.29.1.1. During engine start and ground operations, no items (checklist, charts, etc.)
       should be placed in a position that would prevent inspection of aircraft and engine
       instruments or switches.
       6.29.1.2. During flight, no items (checklists, charts, etc.) will be placed in a position that
       covers or hides any flight or engine instruments from the view of the PF.
       6.29.1.3. Publication kits, flight kits, and personal kits will not be placed where they may
       interfere with the flight controls or egress.

Section 6D—Departure

6.30. Departure Briefings and Procedures. Before initial takeoff, the PF will brief the aircrew
on the procedures to be followed during takeoff and departure, performance data, and intentions
in case of an emergency.
   6.30.1. Any crew member noting a safety of flight malfunction before rotate speed will state,
   ―REJECT‖ and give a brief description of the malfunction. The PIC will brief abort criteria
   prior to takeoff roll if not accomplished in the pre-brief.
6.31. On Time Takeoffs. Mission departures are considered ―on time‖ if the aircraft is airborne
no later than 0.2 hours after the scheduled takeoff time. Early departures are authorized provided
local, down-range and aircrew impact are evaluated and no adverse effect will result.
6.32. Aircraft Control. A qualified evaluator, instructor, or mission pilot will be at a set of
flight controls during all phases of flight. When conducting single pilot operations, the PF will
occupy the left seat.
6.33. Transponder/Aircraft Identification. If installed, operate Mode 4 in accordance with
theater and operational directives. Operational check of the Mode 4 will be made prior to takeoff
(test equipment permitting). The preferred and primary method of testing Mode 4 is with the
ground test set. Do not plan to penetrate the ADIZ without an operational Mode 4.
   6.33.1. Ground and in-flight checks are mandatory maintenance debrief items. Crews will
   annotate any failure or unsuccessful interrogation of the Mode 4 in the aircraft forms. Units
   will develop procedures for accomplishing the Mode 4 ground check. The check should be
   coordinated between aircrew and maintenance during the aircraft preflight.
   6.33.2. Interrogation Friend or Foe (IFF) modes 1, 2, 3A and S codes are not classified and
   may be left set in the transponder. IFF Mode 4 codes will be zeroized before leaving the
   aircraft for extended periods of time.
6.34. Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning Sensor (EGPWS). Operate the EGPWS in
accordance with the U-28 POH.
   6.34.1. During day VMC flight, EGPWS alerts will be followed unless the pilot can verify
   the warning is false by visual contact with the terrain/obstacle. The flying pilot will call
   terrain/obstacle in site, state intentions to the crew and visually clear the terrain/obstacle.
   6.34.2. During night or IMC flights, pilots will take immediate action to clear the EGPWS
   warning unless they are established on an approach. While executing the approach, the
   flying pilot will verify terrain/obstacles by all available means and state intentions to the
   crew.
 44                                                        AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012


   6.34.3. Terrain inhibit switch. The terrain inhibit switch will only be selected once landing
   is assured and the aircraft is in a safe position to land (day/night). The pilot flying will state,
   ―EGPWS acknowledged, landing assured,‖ the non-flying pilot will verify and then select
   INHIBIT ON, stating ―EGPWS inhibited.‖ WARNING: The EGPWS Terrain Inhibit will
   be OFF for each approach and verified by the pilot flying prior to commencing the
   subsequent approach.         WARNING: Do not delay pull-up for diagnosis of an EGPWS
   warning.
6.35. Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) Operations. Failure to acknowledge a
traffic advisory may increase the probability of a midair collision. If able, all crew members will
monitor voice callouts.
   6.35.1. Use the above/below/normal/unrestricted settings as appropriate for the phase of
   flight and mission.

Section 6E—En Route

6.36. En Route Briefings and Procedures. Conduct in-flight briefings, as necessary, to cover
any unusual circumstances and when flight safety or other conditions require the nonstandard
accomplishment of any maneuver.
6.37. Flight Progress. Use all available navigation aids to maintain course centerline and a
positive fix on the aircraft’s position. When conducting navigation using a GPS for primary
navigation or autopilot flight coupling, the pilots will also use appropriate navigational aids (e.g.,
Very High Frequency (VHF) Omnidirectional Range (VOR)) to maintain a positive fix on the
aircraft’s position.
6.38. Crew Duties and Responsibilities.
   6.38.1. Transfer of Aircraft Control. The transfer of aircraft or flight controls will be
   accomplished using a positive change of controls. Use the statement ―Pilot/Copilot has
   controls‖ to transfer control. The other pilot will acknowledge the change of aircraft control
   by stating ―Pilot/Copilot has controls‖.
   6.38.2. Interphone Communications. Limit interphone conversations to those essential for
   crew coordination. All crew members will monitor the aircraft interphone. Do not discuss
   classified information on interphone during non-secure radio transmissions.
   6.38.3. All crew members will maintain communications on aircraft interphone prior to
   engine start through completion of the engine shutdown checklist. Clearance is required
   from the PIC prior to an aircrew member removing headset. The aircrew member will advise
   the PIC when they have resumed monitoring the aircraft interphone.
   6.38.4. The PIC or designated aircrew member operating the command or mission radios
   will inform the crew which radio is primary All crew members will monitor the primary
   command radio unless specifically directed otherwise by the PIC.
   6.38.5. Record and read back all ATC clearances except when ATC instructions require
   immediate execution and read back would interfere with the timely performance of aircrew
   duties.
AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                    45


6.39. Radar Advisories. Participate to the maximum extent possible while operating in VFR or
simulated IFR conditions.
6.40. Communication Instructions for Reporting Vital Intelligence Sightings and Other
Reports. Refer to AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting. Report all vital intelligence sightings
from aircraft as indicated in FLIP Planning or FIH.
   6.40.1. In-flight harassment or hostile action against aircraft. Aircraft subjected to
   harassment or hostile action by foreign aircraft will immediately contact the nearest USAF
   air-to-ground voice facility and report the encounter. Include aircraft nationality, type,
   insignia, or any other identifying features; note position, heading, time, speed when harassed,
   and type of harassment. Request a relay of the report to the nearest C2 agency. Also,
   attempt to contact the nearest command post when in UHF and VHF range.
   6.40.2. Other incidents will be reported as indicated in JCS Publication 6V5 and AFI 10-
   206, Operational Reporting.
6.41. In-flight Emergency (IFE) Procedures. Report deviations from directives that occur as a
result of an emergency in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 3, AFSOC Sup 1, General
Flight Rules, and this instruction.
   6.41.1. The PNF should be the primary crew member responsible for executing emergency
   checklist procedures. Normally the PF will manipulate the power lever, condition lever, and
   manual override lever. The PF maintains aircraft control and reacts appropriately. The PF
   will confirm any switches prior to being actuated and will reference the checklist for
   guidance during the emergency. The PNF and other crew members should review the POH
   as appropriate and as time permits.
   6.41.2. Notification of Controlling Agencies. As soon as practical after completing the
   aircraft emergency procedure checklist or critical action procedures, furnish the controlling
   agency a description and extent of the difficulty, assistance required, intentions, and any
   further pertinent information. During emergencies, monitor simultaneous Ultra High
   Frequency (UHF) and VHF transmissions, if able, when operating in a terminal area under
   radar control.
   6.41.3. Turnaround Procedures. When a turnaround is necessary, use procedures in FLIP.
   Maintain VFR, reverse course, climb or descend to a VFR altitude or flight level and request
   ATC clearance. If unable to maintain VFR, obtain an ATC clearance before reversing
   course. A turnaround under IFR conditions, without ATC approval, will be made only after a
   thorough evaluation of the seriousness of the emergency, general traffic density, and known
   traffic operating in the immediate area. Normally, a climb or descent (with minimum change
   in altitude) to a VFR altitude or flight level will result in minimum exposure to other aircraft,
   if a turnaround is required.
   6.41.4. Need for Medical Assistance. When a person on board the aircraft requires medical
   care, the PIC will inform the station of next intended landing in sufficient time so medical
   personnel may meet the aircraft. The request will include the individual’s gender,
   approximate age, and the nature of the medical problem.

Section 6F—Arrival
 46                                                     AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012


6.42. Approach Lighting System (ALS) Inoperative. Increase the published visibility
minimums of an instrument approach by stated criteria in NOTAMs, ATIS information, or as
depicted on the approach procedure, when the runway ALS is inoperative. This applies only to
the ALS itself, not other lights which are not a component of the ALS (e.g., Visual Approach
Slope Indicator, Precision Approach Path Indicator). If no other guidance is provided, increase
the published visibility by ½ mile.
6.43. Arrival. Before starting each approach, the PF will brief the procedures to be followed
during approach, landing, and go-around/missed approach, as necessary. Performance data will
be reviewed. This briefing will be accomplished prior to the completion of the Before Landing
Checklist.
   6.43.1. Airspeeds. Reference Landing Speed (Vref) will be calculated and briefed before
   landing. Pilots will not fly slower than centered AOA around final turn until established on
   final. Final will be flown no slower than centered AOA until preparing for landing. NOTE:
   During precision landing operations crews may slow to the AOA slow diamond early in
   preparation for landing but will not fly slower than one diamond until final touchdown
   maneuver.
   6.43.2. Airspeeds for emergency operations. Centered AOA should be flown for Simulated
   Flame Outs (SFOs), Emergency Landing Patterns (ELP’s), or actual engine emergency
   operation. This does not preclude the pilot from flying a faster airspeed if required for
   energy management or as required for safety.
6.44. Radar Altimeter Procedures.
   6.44.1. During VFR operations, the recommended low altitude warning setting is 90 percent
   of intended or flown cruise altitude.
   6.44.2. For instrument approaches, set the radar or baro altimeter low altitude warning to the
   appropriate Height Above Touchdown, Height Above Aerodrome, Minimum Descent
   Altitude, Decision Altitude, or Decision Height prior to the Final Approach Fix.
6.45. Holding Exception for Remote or Island Destinations. IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3,
AFSOC Sup 1, General Flight Rules, aircrew are authorized to hold for one hour in lieu of an
alternate for remote or island destinations.
6.46. Instrument Approach Procedures.
   6.46.1. Weather Below Minimums. If the reported ceiling is below the minimum for the
   approach, but the visibility value is at or above the authorized minimums before initiating an
   en route descent, ensure fuel remaining is sufficient to accomplish the en route descent and
   approach, missed approach, and flight to alternate with appropriate reserves.
   6.46.2. Circling Minimums. The PC-12 Trainer and U-28 are Category B aircraft. The PF
   may fly circling approaches at higher speeds raising the circling minimums to the category
   for the speed to be flown. The PF is responsible for briefing speeds and flying the approach
   according to the correct minimums.
6.47. Maximum Rate descent.
AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                  47


   6.47.1. The minimum equipment required for a max rate descent is: a fully functional IS&S
   panel for each pilot, a functional radar altimeter, and an operational altitude/vertical speed
   preselect.
   6.47.2. Briefing Requirements:
       6.47.2.1. The descent's start point in mean sea level (MSL) altitude and distance from the
       arrival airfield.
       6.47.2.2. The descent path and relationship to the arrival runway, and whether a
       descending turn is required and in which direction.
       6.47.2.3. The ―pullout‖ altitude in both AGL and MSL, which will be no lower than
       2,000 ft AGL.
       6.47.2.4. The "level off" altitude in both AGL and MSL and the expected distance from
       the arrival airfield. The level off altitude will be 1,000 ft AGL or the arrival airfield’s
       pattern altitude, whichever is greater.
       6.47.2.5. The location and altitude of the high terrain threat along the projected aircraft
       ground track during the maneuver.
   6.47.3. Procedures.
       6.47.3.1. The barometric minimums pointer on the IS&S panel will be set to the pullout
       altitude. The altitude/vertical speed preselect will be set to the level off altitude.
       6.47.3.2. The nonflying pilot will call ―2,000 feet above‖ and ―1,000 feet above,‖ the
       level-off altitude.
       6.47.3.3. The nonflying pilot will call out ―radar altimeter alive.‖ The flying pilot will
       begin to arrest the descent at a minimum of 1,000 ft above level off altitude.
       6.47.3.4. Aircraft pitch will not exceed -25 degrees and bank angle is limited to 45
       degrees (at night) and 60 degrees (during the day) throughout the maneuver.
       6.47.3.5. The nonflying pilot will cross check IS&S instrumentation with the visual
       picture outside the aircraft.
       6.47.3.6. The CSO will back up the altitude calls of the pilot not flying.

Section 6G—After Landing

6.48. Maintenance. Complete aircraft maintenance forms after each flight.
   6.48.1. Immediately after arrival, the PIC and any aircrew member documenting a
   maintenance discrepancy will debrief maintenance personnel on the status of the aircraft and
   subsystems. The discrepancy will be documented in the aircraft maintenance forms. At
   locations where there is no maintenance personnel and maintenance support is required, the
   PIC will ensure a thorough debrief is provided to the MC or command post prior to entering
   crew rest.
6.49. Impoundment. If an aircraft is involved in a ground or in-flight incident, the PIC should
impound the aircraft immediately and contact the Unit CC, DO, or appropriate controlling
agency for further instructions.
 48                                                       AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012


6.50. Clearwater Rinse Facility (Birdbath). Aircrew will not use Clearwater Rinse facilities
in order to prevent damage to the aircraft.
   6.50.1. An entry will be placed in the aircraft maintenance forms, ―Aircraft Subjected to Salt
   Spray‖ anytime the aircraft is flown over salt water below 1,000 feet AGL, except for
   takeoffs and landings. Document the lowest altitude and duration the aircraft was subjected
   to salt spray.
6.51. Customs, Immigration, and Agriculture Inspections.
   6.51.1. Complete customs, agriculture, and public health clearance forms, as required, prior
   to opening any doors other than the crew door or enplaning and deplaning personnel.
   6.51.2. Proceed directly from the aircraft to customs, immigration, or agricultural inspection
   for processing at those stations where federal or local inspections are required. The PIC or
   designated representative completes the necessary forms before reporting to inspectors.
   6.51.3. After clearing with border clearance agencies, the PIC or designated representative
   will return to the aircraft for offloading and other post-flight procedures.
   6.51.4. A US military aircraft is a sovereign instrument. When cleared to over-fly or land in
   foreign territory, it is US policy to assert that military aircraft are entitled to the privileges
   and immunities which customarily are accorded warships. These privileges and immunities
   include, in the absence of stipulations to the contrary, exemption from duties and taxation;
   immunity from search, seizure, and inspections (including customs and safety inspections);
   or other exercise of jurisdiction by the host nation over the aircraft, personnel, equipment, or
   cargo on board. The PIC will not authorize search, seizure, inspection, or similar exercises
   of jurisdiction enumerated above by foreign authorities except by direction of HQ USAF or
   the American Embassy in the country concerned.
   6.51.5. PIC will not permit the inspection of their aircraft by officials of any foreign
   government. If requested to do so, the PIC and crew will deny access and seek aid from the
   senior AFSOC or USAF representative or US Embassy or consulate within the host nation.
   Inform customs or other officials of the above policy and request that they confirm their
   request through their own government and with US Department of State representatives. If
   necessary, the aircrew will seal the aircraft and enter into crew rest, and relay departure
   intentions, until resolution of the matter by appropriate authority. Use communications by
   the fastest means available to inform command and control facilities should this situation
   occur.
   6.51.6. When confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should
   consider the following procedures:
       6.51.6.1. In most cases, search attempts may be stopped by a statement of the PIC to the
       foreign officials that the aircraft is a sovereign instrument not subject to search without
       consent of HQ USAF or the chief of mission in the country concerned. This should be
       clearly conveyed in a polite manner so as not to offend foreign authorities that may
       honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have authority to search USAF aircraft.
       6.51.6.2. If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, the PIC must negotiate to
       delay the search until contact is made with HQ USAF/A3OFN or the appropriate
       embassy (US or other friendly nation). The PIC should unequivocally state, the aircrew
AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                  49


       has no authority to consent to the search and that they must relay the foreign request to
       these agencies for decision. The PIC should then notify these agencies of the foreign
       request by the most expeditious means available. Thereafter, the PIC should follow
       instructions provided by the appropriate embassy and HQ USAF.
       6.51.6.3. If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, the PIC should
       indicate that they would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel and mechanical
       considerations permit a safe departure) and request permission for immediate departure.
       6.51.6.4. If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their way
       on board an aircraft, the PIC should state that he protests the course of action being
       pursued and that he intends to notify both HQ USAF and the US Embassy of the foreign
       action. The PIC should then allow the foreign agents on board the aircraft, without
       physical resistance, and thereafter report the incident to HQ USAF and the US Embassy
       as soon as possible.
   6.51.7. In all instances, specific instructions may be briefed because of sensitive cargo or
   equipment. These instructions and applicable provisions of classified supplements to the
   foreign clearance guide should be followed where applicable.
6.52. Crew Debriefing/Post Mission Actions.
   6.52.1. Training Missions. The PIC will conduct the debriefing session and complete the
   appropriate documentation. The PIC will ensure all applicable information is passed to
   controlling agencies.
   6.52.2. Combat Operations. Each aircrew participating in operations under actual combat
   conditions will participate in an intelligence and mission debriefing session.
   6.52.3. The Squadron CC, DO, or MC will ensure that all aircrews are debriefed
   immediately following a combat or combat support mission during which any tactics or
   procedures were observed that may affect other operations.
   6.52.4. PIC encountering hostile fire will submit an immediate airborne report to their
   controlling agency followed by a hostile fire incident report to intelligence immediately after
   landing.
   6.52.5. Other Missions. The PIC has the responsibility of affording to each crew member
   the opportunity to discuss unusual aspects of the mission. Debriefings may be formal or
   informal, as the situation requires.
   6.52.6. When transiting installations, the PIC will establish a point of contact with the base
   operations or FBO for overnight billeting. The PIC will be immediately notified in the case
   of incident or emergency affecting the safety or security of the aircraft.

Section 6H—Miscellaneous

6.53. Electronic Devices. The use of electronic devices is as specified in AFI 11-202,
Volume 3, AFSOC Sup 1, General Flight Rules. For electronic devices not listed, the user will
provide the aircrew a letter from the Aeronautical Systems Division, Deputy for Engineering
(ASC/ENAE) certifying the device is approved for airborne use. If the aircrew detects any
 50                                                       AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012


interference from an electronic device used aboard the aircraft, discontinue the use of this device
for the duration of the flight.
6.54. Jamming and Interference. All aircrews and other radio users must be familiar with the
procedures for reporting incidents of Meaconing, Intrusion, Jamming, and Interference (MIJI) or
Spectrum Interference (SI). Info HQ AFSOC/A3TW on all MIJI/SI reports.
6.55. Utilization of Civilian Law Enforcement or Medical Personnel. Generally, before
transporting civilian law enforcement officials or civilian medical personnel, obtain proper
authorization through OG/CC or COMAFSOF and a legal review by the servicing staff judge
advocate (SJA) to ensure compliance with applicable law and DoD policy. Commanders will
not transport civilian law enforcement personnel into areas of imminent danger or where
confrontation with civilian criminal targets is likely, will not use military force against civilian
criminal targets unless in self defense, and will not direct the action of civilian authorities in
enforcing the law or making arrests.
   6.55.1. Civilian Law Enforcement Support. It is the policy of the Department of Defense
   (DoD) to cooperate with civilian law enforcement officials to the maximum extent
   practicable. AFI 10-801, Defense Support of Civil Authorities, incorporates the appropriate
   directive and provides uniform policies and procedures service members must follow when
   supporting federal, state, and local civilian law enforcement agencies. It establishes specific
   limitations and restrictions on the use of Air Force personnel, equipment, facilities, and
   services by civilian law enforcement organizations. Report all requests for assistance and
   coordinate all requests from civilian law enforcement authorities through the appropriate C2
   channels.
6.56. Hazardous Material Procedures. The term ―hazardous material‖ includes any material,
which, because of its quantity, properties, or packaging, may endanger human life or property.
Procedures in this paragraph apply whenever aircraft carry DoD Hazard Class/Division 1.1, 1.2,
or 1.3 explosives, Department of Transportation (DoT) Class A and B poisons, etiological or
biological research materials, radioactive materials requiring yellow III labels, and inert devices.
Also included are DoD Hazard Class/Division 1.4 explosives, oxidizers, compressed gases,
flammable solids and liquids, and corrosive liquids listed in AFMAN 24-204(I), Preparing
Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipment.
   6.56.1. Briefing. Reference AFMAN 24-204(I) Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military
   Air Shipment.
   6.56.2. Cargo Documentation.        Do not accept hazardous materials unless proper
   documentation, certification, and identification of cargo are provided. This includes
   transportation control number entered correctly on both the cargo manifest and the Shipper’s
   Declaration for Dangerous Goods.
   6.56.3. Flight Planning. The PIC (unless specifically briefed otherwise):
       6.56.3.1. Enters ―Hazardous Cargo‖ and the mission number in the appropriate section of
       the flight plan. Use remarks section of DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan, information
       section of DD Form 1801, DoD International Flight Plan, or ICAO Flight Plan Form.
       6.56.3.2. Plans the flight to minimize over-flying heavily populated or otherwise critical
       areas.
AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012                                                               51


     6.56.3.3. Prepares a departure message. The remarks section of the departure message
     should include the following:
         6.56.3.3.1. DoT class and DoD hazard class or division, if applicable, of hazardous
         material on board (Include net weight of DoT Class A or B poisons and net explosive
         weight of Class A or B explosives).
         6.56.3.3.2. Request for special support (e.g., isolated parking, security, technical
         escort teams, etc.).
         6.56.3.3.3. Inert devices (when applicable).
     6.56.3.4. If ETE is less than 1 hour, or if other circumstances preclude timely receipt at
     destination, notify base operations at the first intended landing, by priority telephone.
  6.56.4. Before Engine Start. Ensure placards are removed. Give the controlling agency
  parking location, approximate engine start time, and verify that the firefighting agency has
  the hazardous materials information. If not, request the following be relayed to the fire
  fighting agency:
     6.56.4.1. DoT class of hazardous material on board and the DoD hazard class or division
     for explosive material on board.
     6.56.4.2. Net Explosive Weight.
     6.56.4.3. Request for isolated parking (if necessary).
     6.56.4.4. Estimated time of departure.
  6.56.5. En Route. Normal procedures apply.            Avoid over-flying heavily populated or
  otherwise critical areas.
  6.56.6. Before Landing. Accomplish the following unless specifically prohibited by the
  theater commander or FLIP planning:
     6.56.6.1. Contact the base operations dispatcher, control tower, approach control, or
     other agency specified in FLIP at least 30 minutes (or as soon as practical) before ETA to
     announce that hazardous materials are on board and to verify that the appropriate base
     support agencies have received the departure message. If not, transmit the mission
     number, ETA, and information.
     6.56.6.2. If landing at a CONUS civil airport without a tower, give the previous
     information to the nearest FAA flight service station.
     6.56.6.3. Request the information be relayed immediately to base operations or the civil
     airport manager, crash or fire protection agency, and other support agencies.
  6.56.7. Parking:
     6.56.7.1. DoD requires aircraft carrying DoD Hazard Class or Division 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
     explosives, DoT Class A poisons, and certain biological agents and munitions be parked
     in areas isolated from personnel. PIC’s are responsible for ensuring cargo is correctly
     identified to the tower and ground control. When aircraft are not directed to an isolated
     area, identify the cargo again to tower or ground control. When identification is
     acknowledged, the host is solely responsible for selecting the parking area. Should host

      procedures be questionable, submit trip reports, as appropriate, to document such
      occurrences.
      6.56.7.2. The military host is responsible for ensuring aircraft are properly placarded. For
      non-military installations, the briefing to the PIC will include placard requirements and, if
      required, placards will be furnished at the onload base. The shipper must make prior
      arrangements with the airport manager for shipments of hazardous materials requiring
      placards. The shipper is responsible for cargo identification, firefighting procedures, and
      isolated parking requirements.
   6.56.8. Unscheduled Landing Due to IFE. Transmit unclassified information to the
   appropriate air traffic control facility as follows:
      6.56.8.1. Nature of emergency and intent to land.
      6.56.8.2. Aircraft position and ETA.
      6.56.8.3. Number of personnel and location in aircraft.
      6.56.8.4. Fuel on board.
      6.56.8.5. That hazardous materials are on board, location of the cargo, and applicable
      information.
      6.56.8.6. After Unscheduled Landing. Contact the AFSOC Command Center or
      COMAFSOF by telephone, radio, or message, giving arrival notice, hazardous materials
      information, and other pertinent information as required.
6.57. Hazardous Medical Equipment.
   6.57.1. Nonstandard equipment possessed by medical facilities that use AFSOC air
   evacuation services should be regarded as potentially hazardous. Two types of equipment
   are of major concern:
      6.57.1.1. Electronic medical equipment produces electromagnetic interference which is
      commonly beyond the limits specified by Military Standard (MIL STD) 462D, and
      therefore can interfere with aircraft communication and navigational equipment.
      6.57.1.2. Therapeutic oxygen systems present an increased hazard of fire or explosion.
      A potential hazard is the inadvertent disruption of the cylinder neck, manifold, or
      regulator resulting in explosion and propulsion of the container or accessories.
   6.57.2. For nonstandard electronic medical equipment, take the following precautions:
      6.57.2.1. Pararescue or aeromedical evacuation personnel must inform the PIC when
      nonstandard electronic medical equipment is brought on board the aircraft.
      6.57.2.2. The PIC must be informed of the anticipated period of use of the equipment
      during the mission.
      6.57.2.3. The PIC must be alert for any interference with aircraft communications or
      navigation equipment during periods of use of this equipment.
      6.57.2.4. When continuous use of the equipment is required throughout the duration of
      the mission, flight must be restricted to VFR conditions. Furthermore, exercise
AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                 53


       additional caution on night VFR missions to ensure there are no adverse effects on
       navigational equipment.
   6.57.3. For nonstandard oxygen equipment, take the following precautions:
       6.57.3.1. All compressed oxygen equipment with exposed, unprotected cylinder neck,
       manifold, or regulator must be completely secured from all movement in its longitudinal
       and lateral axes.
       6.57.3.2. Pararescue or aeromedical evacuation personnel must continually monitor the
       operation of the equipment to detect possible malfunction during exposure to altitude.
6.58. Narcotics. Aircrew members will ensure narcotics and other unauthorized items are not
smuggled onboard the aircraft. Maintain narcotics that are part of official medical kits in
accordance with appropriate directives.
6.59. Dropped Objects. During aircraft exterior visual inspections, pay particular attention to
surfaces, panels, and components, which could potentially be dropped objects. If a dropped
object is discovered and the mission is continued, the PIC will:
   6.59.1. Ensure documentation is entered into the aircraft maintenance forms.
   6.59.2. Notify the controlling agency as soon as practical. Include route of flight, altitude,
   and weather conditions encountered.

                                           Chapter 7

                                   AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance for aircraft security on the ground and in-flight.
AFSOC PC-12 Trainer and U-28 aircraft are Protection Level "3" resources. This security
priority designation applies to operational aircraft, wherever they are located, worldwide. Some
aircraft contain equipment and documents that require protection per DoD 5200.01, DoD
Information Security Program; Protection of Classified Information, AFI 31-101, Integrated
Defense, and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management.
7.2. Procedures. The PIC is ultimately responsible for the security of their aircraft when
located away from US military installations. Air Force Joint Instruction (AFJI) 31-102, Physical
Security, covers security arrangements when US Air Force aircraft are located on other US
military installations. Arrangements must be made to protect the aircraft during crew rest status
at non-US protected locations. If US military security forces are not available, the US embassy
assigned to that country must be consulted to ensure security arrangements are made. For
missions involving a planning agency, the agency must coordinate with the PIC to ensure the
planned security measures conform to mission requirements. The amount of security required
will vary, depending on location and ground time.
   7.2.1. For nonpermissive or uncertain environments, airfield and LZ security is the
   responsibility of the agency requesting support. Crew will work with the agency requesting
   the support to insure security meets the requirement for the mission.
   7.2.2. For permissive environments, the PIC will receive a threat assessment and force
   protection capability evaluation briefing at home station prior to departure and receive
   updates enroute, if required. When landing at DoD component installations, the installation
   commander is responsible for providing adequate security for the aircraft. The PIC will
   determine if security is adequate. Planning agencies and the PIC will use Table 7.1. to help
   assess the risk to parked aircraft for planned overnight stops located at non-US military
   installations overseas and civilian airfields.      NOTE: Aircrews possess the training to
   provide the appropriate security when present at the aircraft. For unscheduled or emergency
   landings at non-USAF installations, the PIC will assess the aircraft security situation and take
   the following actions, if force protection capability appears insufficient:
       7.2.2.1. Aircrew surveillance. If the aircraft is not remaining overnight, aircrews are
       capable of maintaining appropriate aircraft security. The PIC will direct armed crew
       members to remain with the aircraft and maintain surveillance of aircraft entrances and
       activities in the aircraft vicinity.
       7.2.2.2. Area Patrol. Request area patrol coverage from local security forces to include
       back-up response forces. If local authorities request payment for this service, use AF
       Form 15, USAF Invoice.
       7.2.2.3. Departure without Crew Rest. If local security forces are unacceptable or
       unavailable, the PIC may waive FDP restrictions and depart as soon as possible for a
       destination with adequate force protection. If unable to depart the location due to system
       malfunction, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best of their ability. In no case,
       will the entire crew leave the aircraft unattended. Crew rest requirements will be
AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                  55


     subordinate to aircraft security when the aircraft may be at risk. The PIC should rotate a
     security detail among the crew to provide for both aircraft protection and crew rest until
     relief is available. The PIC will coordinate through appropriate C2 channels to acquire
     additional security.
     7.2.2.4. Tailored Security Measures. Standard physical security measures may be
     impractical at times due to mission, terrain, climate, sociopolitical sensitivities, or other
     factors. For example, some countries don't allow armed security personnel. On other
     deployments, the mission may rely on maintaining a low profile and attracting as little
     attention as possible. At such locations, tailor security measures to meet unique
     requirements when necessary. As a minimum, lock aircraft entry points and hatches. If it
     is not possible to lock aircraft, secure aircraft entry points and hatches in a manner to
     indicate unauthorized entry (i.e., taping hatch release handles or using seals). The PIC is
     the final authority for determining tailored security measures. Contact with US Embassy
     personnel is required at locations where security agreements are not in existence.
  7.2.3. Ground security teams. Ground security teams may be considered to guard the
  aircraft for planned overnight stops. Teams may travel in Mission Essential Personnel
  (MEP) status and are responsible to the PIC at all times. The PIC will ensure security team
  members receive a mission briefing, aircraft egress, and passenger briefings, as appropriate.
  The squadron commander is the final approval authority for the need of ground security
  teams for their aircraft and authority may be delegated no lower than the PIC.
     7.2.3.1. Ground security teams will comply with AFMAN 24-204(I), Preparing
     Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipments, at all times when carrying weapons,
     ammunition, and equipment onboard the aircraft.
     7.2.3.2. Due to the sensitivity of weapons in foreign countries, ground security teams
     will keep their weapons inside the aircraft and out of sight of foreign nationals, even if
     the FCG allows them to be carried outside the aircraft. If a destination requires weapons
     be carried outside the aircraft, the controlling MAJCOM must approve such action prior
     to deployment.
  7.2.4. Unauthorized Entry. If, in the PIC’s judgment, the aircraft needs to be locked and
  sealed as a measure to detect unauthorized entry:
     7.2.4.1. Use the aircraft lock. NOTE: The aircraft will be locked during all off-station
     missions remaining overnight.
     7.2.4.2. If the aircraft lock is unavailable, secure the hatches and doors in a manner that
     will indicate unauthorized entry. For example, tape inside hatch release handles to the
     airframe, so that entry pulls the tape loose. Close and seal doors using a metal boxcar
     seal or other controllable device to identify forced entry. Wipe the immediate area
     around the seal to help investigate forced entry. If the seals are damaged or have been
     tampered with, notify the appropriate local authorities, the controlling agency, and
     inspect the aircraft thoroughly.
     7.2.4.3. Coordinate with the local base operations representative on procedures for
     servicing the aircraft while the crew is away. If a padlock is used, the key or combination
     may be left with base operations or the representative for servicing and maintenance
     personnel if required.
 56                                                                AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012


   7.2.5. Security awareness is crucial to effective mission accomplishment. Aircrews must
   always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.
   During preflight activities, aircrews will inspect accessible areas to include aircraft wheel-
   wells, air conditioning compartments, and cargo compartment for unauthorized packages,
   personnel, or other unfamiliar devices. Report any suspicious items to host security forces.
   Aircrews will maintain a heightened security posture throughout all pre-takeoff activities.
7.3. Aircraft Security Risk Assessment Matrix. Planning agencies and the PIC will use this
matrix to help assess the risk to parked aircraft in a permissive environment. This matrix will be
used for planned overnight stops at non-US military installations overseas and civilian airfields.
A cumulative score of less than 55 implies that normal unmanned aircraft security measures are
adequate. A score of 55 to 90 implies moderate security risk. The unit or mission commander
may consider additional security measures. If the cumulative score is greater than 90,
commanders should consider deploying or contracting security personnel. The unit or mission
commander is the final approval authority for aircraft security issues. Authority may be
delegated no lower than the PIC. EXCEPTION: During unscheduled or emergency landings
the PIC is the final approval authority for aircraft security. The PIC should contact the US
Embassy or US Defense Attaché Office for security assistance. NOTE: Normally, additional
security for the aircraft is not required at military installations within a NATO country or US
civilian airfields approved by the FAA/Transportation Security Administration.

 NOTES:
 1. Derive the local threat from valid intelligence sources only.
 2. ―Adequate lighting‖ is equal to the illumination provided by one standard USAF light cart.
 3. If a security response team and security patrols are not present, commanders should consider deploying or contracting
 security personnel.

7.4. Protective Standards for Aircraft Carrying DV. This paragraph applies specifically to
aircraft transporting DV Code 4 or above. PICs are responsible for aircraft security at en route
stops.
    7.4.1. DoD Installations. Notify the base security forces of estimated arrival and departure
    times. Request continuous security surveillance during the entire ground time. If the
    installation is unable to comply, arrange for the best protection available.
    7.4.2. Non-DoD Installations. Contact the airport manager or installation commander to
    arrange for force protection. If available security is inadequate, purchase additional security
    using AF Form 15, USAF Invoice.
7.5. Arming of Crew members. IAW AFI 31-117, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force
Personnel and AFMAN 31-229, USAF Weapons Handling Manual, an appropriate authority
may direct the arming of aircrew members as deemed necessary by mission threat analysis.
    7.5.1. Weapons Issue. Before departing home station, authorized crew members will obtain
    weapons, ammunition, lock, and key. Crew members must present a current AF Form 523,
    USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms, to be issued a weapon. Crew members will be
    reissued the same weapon until the mission terminates at home station. If an armed crew
    member must leave the crew en route, transfer the weapon to another authorized crew
    member, using AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.
 58                                                      AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012


   7.5.2. Loading and Transfer of Weapons. Load and unload weapons at approved clearing
   barrels/facilities if available. To transfer a loaded weapon to another crew member, place the
   weapon on a flat surface. Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer.
   7.5.3. Wearing of Weapons. Wear weapons in a holster, concealed at all times to protect the
   identity of armed crew members. Do not wear weapons off the flight line, except to and
   from the command post, armories, and other facilities associated with aircrew activities such
   as base operations, fleet service, cargo or passenger terminals, flight line cafeterias, snack
   bars, etc.
   7.5.4. Weapons Storage. Crew members will be armed before beginning preflight or on-load
   duties. When no passengers are on board and after a satisfactory stowaway check, weapons
   may be stored in the gun box in-flight. If no gun box is available retain weapon for the
   duration of the flight. Crew members will rearm before landing. Weapons need not be
   unloaded before being placed in the gun box.
   7.5.5. Crew Rest. During crew rest, store weapons in the most secure facility available,
   normally the base armory. If a weapons storage facility is unavailable or the country
   prohibits or restricts the entry of weapons, secure firearms and ammunition in the gun box.
       7.5.5.1. Aircraft without a Gun Box. If an aircraft must remain overnight at a location
       where a government-owned storage facility is unavailable, use the nearest acceptable
       facility. Acceptable storage facilities are US or Allied military services armories, US
       National Guard and Reserve armories, US civil law enforcement armories, and US
       Embassies. If none of these are available, or the PIC believes weapons security may be
       compromised, crew members may secure their weapons in their quarters. One crew
       member will remain with the weapons at all times. In this case, turn the ammunition over
       to the PIC.
7.6. General Antihijacking Guidance. Aircrews must make every reasonable effort to resist
an aircraft hijacking attempt, resistance may vary from dissuasion, to direct physical
confrontation, including the use of deadly force. Due to the sensitive nature of anti-hijacking
procedures, crew members should reference AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft
Piracy (For Official Use Only) and the FIH for specific guidance. Aircrews will not release any
information concerning those procedures or hijacking attempts. Antihijacking is a crew duty
performed exclusively by aircrew personnel. The hijacking of an AFSOC aircraft could create a
serious international incident and jeopardize the safety of passengers and property. An aircraft is
most vulnerable when the crew is on board and the aircraft is ready for flight. Hijackers may be
mentally disturbed, emotionally unstable individuals for whom the threat of death is not a
deterrent. Delay tactics have been most successful in saving lives and property. Detection of
potential hijackers before they board the aircraft is the best solution to the problem.
   7.6.1. Acceptance of Passengers. The host station passenger processing and manifesting
   facility should conduct antihijacking inspections. Do not board passengers unless the aircraft
   commander is fully satisfied with these inspections. EXCEPTION: Supporting/supported
   forces may be antihijack inspected at the aircraft by the aircrew.
       7.6.1.1. Aeromedical Procedures. Military medical facility commanders are responsible
       for the anti-hijacking inspection of patients. When patients are delivered to the aircraft
       by civilian sources, the aircrew will perform required inspections before departure.
AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                 59


   7.6.2. Contingency and exercise movements. During contingencies in support of combat
   operations and exercises involving the movement of large numbers of personnel, the
   supported unit should manifest passengers and perform antihijacking inspections.
   7.6.3. Arms and Ammunition. Passengers (including MEGP) will not carry weapons and/or
   ammunition on their person or in hand-carried baggage on board an aircraft. EXCEPTION:
   special agents/guards of the Secret Service or State Department, and other individuals
   specifically authorized to carry weapons in coordination with the PIC. In all cases, the crew
   will be aware of the location of weapons and ammunition.
       7.6.3.1. If individuals must clear their weapons before boarding the aircraft, and access
       to clearing barrel/facilities is limited, as a minimum, direct them to:
          7.6.3.1.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or
          personnel before unholstering/unslinging their weapons.
          7.6.3.1.2. Clear their weapons in accordance with standard safety procedures.
       7.6.3.2. Troops and deadhead crew members will not retain custody of ammunition on
       the aircraft but will turn it in to the troop commander or PIC. EXCEPTION: During
       combat operations, troops may carry unloaded weapons and ammunition on board the
       aircraft. When the tactical situation dictates, personnel who will engage an enemy force
       immediately upon deplaning at the objective may carry loaded weapons on board the
       aircraft at the discretion of the troop commander/team leader with the PIC’s concurrence.
       Weapons will not be breached until clear of the aircraft.
7.7. Specific Antihijacking Guidance. It is imperative that all crew members are familiar with
the ground and inflight resistance actions, covert communications, and forced penetration of
unfriendly airspace procedures in AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy
(Hijacking), and the FIH. In the event of a hijacking, crew members must act immediately and
resourcefully, without instruction, in order to counter the attacker successfully.

                                 MISSION EMPLOYMENT

8.1. Terminal Operations.
   8.1.1. Takeoff Procedures. Compute aircraft performance data prior to departure if
   personnel, equipment, or fuel have been on or off loaded.
   8.1.2. If any degradation in on-board systems is discovered which could result in loss of
   situational awareness during approach, the PIC will inform the crew. The decision to
   proceed rests with the PIC.
   8.1.3. Go-around Calls. If any crew member calls ―Go-around‖ the PF will immediately
   apply power to establish a climb that clears all obstacles. Minimum altitude for over flight of
   aircraft, equipment, or personnel on the runway is 500 feet AGL.
8.2. Tactical Operations. Execute the proper tactical procedure based upon threat analysis and
aircraft performance. For all tactical operations, follow theater specific ATC procedures to avoid
potential conflicts.
   8.2.1. Radio Communication. The PIC will plan and brief individual responsibilities for
   secure communication loading, voice radio configuration, and communication during the
   mission. Coordination between all aircrew members is essential for safe and effective
   mission accomplishment. All aircrew members that have the capability to monitor radios
   must be alert to back up the assigned crew members when duties allow. The PIC will assign
   radio monitoring and transmission duties after examining each phase of flight for mission
   requirements and individual workload.
   8.2.2. Preparation for NVG Operations. Cockpit and cabin lights may be taped or covered
   with NVG compatible film if they will interfere with NVG operations and cannot be
   otherwise disabled without removing aircraft power (e.g., pulling circuit breakers). Landing
   gear indicators will not be covered with tape.
   8.2.3. Tactical Departures and Arrivals will be flown in accordance with U-28 Tactics
   Manuals.
8.3. Aircraft Navigation Systems.
   8.3.1. GPS approaches. The PC-12 Trainer and U-28 are approved to use GPS for en route
   operations, terminal procedures to include Area Navigation (RNAV) arrivals and departures,
   and RNAV instrument approaches to the RNAV published approach minimums. U-28
   aircraft and some PC-12 aircraft are certified to conduct both Lateral Navigation (LNAV)
   and Lateral Navigation/Vertical Navigation approaches. Most PC-12 Trainer aircraft are
   certified to conduct only LNAV approaches. Consult aircraft specific navigation equipment
   operating manuals for specific operating guidance and certification.
   8.3.2. Self-contained Approaches. Although the U-28 navigation system enables approaches
   and pseudo approaches to be constructed and flown, these type approaches may only be used
   as a situational awareness aid and may not be used as the sole means of navigating to a
   runway or LZ in IMC. WARNING: Self-constructed approaches and pseudo approaches
   do not guarantee obstacle or terrain clearance.
AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                       61


8.4. Austere Landing Zone Operations. Only fully mission qualified aircrews or those
receiving instruction are authorized to operate in accordance with this section. Use normal
takeoff and landing procedures whenever practical.
8.5. Austere Landing Zone Assessment.
   8.5.1. Mission operations may necessitate changes. Carefully evaluate aircraft capabilities
   and the mission environment before the operation. Consider the following:
       8.5.1.1. Security of the operating area.
       8.5.1.2. Terrain and obstacle features along the approach or departure path.
       8.5.1.3. Runway surface conditions (e.g., dirt, grass, dust, small holes, damaged Pierced
       Steel Plank, smooth, rough, etc.).
       8.5.1.4. Surface temperature and density altitude.
       8.5.1.5. Usable runway length and width.
       8.5.1.6. Surface acceleration and deceleration factors (e.g., soft, dry, wet, ice, slope).
       8.5.1.7. Actual and predicted gross weight of aircraft.
       8.5.1.8. Surface winds (e.g., headwind, tailwind, crosswinds, gusty, turbulence).
       8.5.1.9. Number of takeoffs and landings required.
       8.5.1.10. Ground Plan (e.g., ERO, vehicles, marshalling, onload/offload locations, etc.).
8.6. Austere Landing Zone Arrival. Plan arrival altitudes to minimize conflict with terrain or
other airborne traffic.
8.7. Austere Landing Zone Traffic Pattern. When the environment permits, fly normal traffic
patterns. Terrain may require significant modifications to normal traffic patterns. Options are to
enter the traffic pattern via an initial, downwind, base, straight-in, or perpendicular to the
runway.
8.8. Austere Landing Zone Specific Aircrew Procedures. The following procedures are
recommended in addition to the normal procedures in the POH:
   8.8.1. Turn off the Environmental Control System (ECS) as required.
   8.8.2. During the final stage of landing roll, reduce reverse thrust, if conditions permit, to
   prevent debris from causing a restriction to visibility or engine damage.
   8.8.3. Do not land if the LZ is not properly identified or an abort signal is given.
   8.8.4. Brief the ground party and subsequent aircrews on any unexpected hazards
   encountered during takeoff or landing.
   8.8.5. If the aircraft is not on the ground by the pre-briefed go-around point, the crew will
   immediately execute a go-around. Forcing the aircraft onto the runway by lowering the nose,
   especially with airspeeds in excess of Vref, may result in touching down nose wheel first
   and/or the propeller contacting the landing surface.
8.9. Laser Usage. Lasers will always be employed in accordance with established tactics,
theater rules of engagement, and theater special instructions. Prior to employing a laser, aircrew
 62                                                      AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012


members should make every attempt to notify the crew. At no time will any laser be fired over
the horizon.
   8.9.1. Safety. The nominal ocular hazard distances for all U-28 lasers are detailed in the
   Mission Operators Handbook. Any crew member observing adverse weather conditions (i.e.,
   clouds, smoke, etc.) that may cause laser energy to be reflected back into the aircraft should
   notify the crew immediately if laser operations are planned.
   8.9.2. Laser Arming. The aircraft commander will arm lasers individually. Prior to arming,
   the crew member will state which laser they have selected.
   8.9.3. Employment Guidance for Specific Laser Types for Training Missions.
       8.9.3.1. Laser Range Finder. The eyesafe laser range finder (ELRF) may be employed
       during any training mission.
       8.9.3.2. Visible Laser. During training, the visible laser will not be employed outside the
       boundaries of a military installation or range. The visible laser will not be employed
       inside the airspace of an active military airfield unless prior approval has been granted.
       While using a visible laser on a military installation or range, as part of an approved
       training event, only a visible laser which is eyesafe to all persons on the ground can be
       directed at any person, vehicle, or building.
       8.9.3.3. Laser Target Marker (LTM). During training, the laser target marker will not be
       employed outside the boundaries of a military installation or range. During training, the
       aircrew should limit the exposure of any person, vehicles, or buildings to the greatest
       extent practicable. Due to the potential distraction to NVG operations, the LTM will not
       be employed at night inside the airspace of an active airfield unless prior approval has
       been granted.
       8.9.3.4. Laser Range Designator (LRD). The laser LRD will only be fired on laser-
       approved ranges. If ground parties are present they will be advised prior to laser arming
       to ensure they have taken safety precautions.
   8.9.4. The Operations Group (OG) Commander (OG/CC) or COMAFSOF is the waiver
   authority for employing a visible laser during a training mission outside the boundaries of a
   military installation or range.
AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                   63

                                           TRAINING

9.1. General. See AFI 11-202, Volume 1, Aircrew Training, and AFI 11-2U-28, Volume 1, U-
28 Aircrew Training, for additional information.
9.2. Training Aircraft Not Capable of Flight. If an aircraft is not capable of departure within
4 hours after scheduled departure time, cancel the training mission unless waived by the PIC.
Departure consists of actual takeoffs for assigned or planned training missions and does not
include maintenance ops checks.
9.3. Air Combat Maneuver Training. Pilots will make advisory calls to the aircrew prior to
beginning the evasive maneuver. Crew members will clear the aircraft of obstacles throughout
the maneuvering.
9.4. Flare Policy.
   9.4.1. Dispense flares in accordance with controlling agency procedures and restrictions.
   When over water, dispense flares at least 3 NM from any surface vessel, platform, or
   landmass. Follow regulations for local agency notification prior to flare usage.
   9.4.2. If flares have been dispensed during flight, a hung flare check must be accomplished
   upon next landing. The PIC will deplane a crew member or have ground personnel visually
   inspect dispensers to ensure that there are no hung flares. If a hung flare is detected, follow
   local airfield hung flare procedures. If hung flare procedures do not exist at stopping
   location, park the aircraft 300 feet away from other aircraft, flight line equipment, or
   personnel.
   9.4.3. A hung flare is a flare that has partially fired or is extended from the magazine.
   Missing flare endcaps should not be considered hung flares.
9.5. Simulated Instrument Flight.
   9.5.1. The use of a hood or other artificial vision-restricting device is not authorized for any
   phase of flight.
   9.5.2. Initiate practice instrument missed approaches no lower than the minimum altitude for
   the approach being flown.
9.6. Confidence Maneuvers. All confidence maneuvers will be accomplished in VMC
conditions under VFR with a discernable horizon. Ensure the airspace around the aircraft is clear
of traffic by visually clearing the area prior to the maneuver. Do not exceed aircraft limitations.
   9.6.1. Stall Series. Begin ―approach to stall‖ series at least 5,000 feet AGL or 5,000 feet
   above the clouds if operating ―VFR over the top.‖ For ―approach to stall‖ training, recover
   from the stall at the first definite indication (e.g., stick shaker). An IP at a set of flight
   controls is required to perform this maneuver. Power on ―approach to stall‖ training will not
   be performed.
   9.6.2. Steep Turns. Accomplish steep turns at least 1,500 feet AGL or 1,500 feet above the
   clouds if operating ―VFR over the top.‖ Accomplish both 45 and 60 degree bank steep turns.
   Do not exceed 60 degrees of bank.
 64                                                     AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012


   9.6.3. Spins. Intentional spins in the PC-12 Trainer and U-28 are prohibited.
   9.6.4. Slow Flight. Fly an airspeed one diamond below on the Electronic Attitude Direction
   Indicator Angle of Attack Display for the given flap setting. Do not exceed 15 degrees of
   bank. This maneuver is authorized in day VMC only at a minimum of 1,500 feet AGL or
   1,500 feet above clouds if operating ―VFR over the top.‖
   9.6.5. Acrobatics. Acrobatics in the PC-12 Trainer and U-28 are prohibited.
9.7. Simulated Emergency Procedures.
   9.7.1. Practice simulated emergencies which require placing switches in other than their
   normal position or the aircraft in an abnormal configuration as specified in the aircraft
   manual only during training, evaluation, or currency flights when an IP or evaluator pilot is
   in one of the pilot seats.
      9.7.1.1. IP candidates who occupy a pilot seat and are under the supervision of a flight
      examiner pilot, not in the seat, may practice simulated emergency procedures during
      upgrade evaluations to IP.
      9.7.1.2. Preface all simulated emergencies with the word ―simulated‖ and terminate
      simulated emergencies when an actual emergency arises.
      9.7.1.3. Use a realistic approach and do not compound emergencies. Limit simulated
      emergencies to noncritical phases of flight when possible. Notify the controlling agency
      if a nonstandard traffic pattern or pattern requiring special sequencing is anticipated.
   9.7.2. Simulated Engine Failure. Simulated engine failures will only be accomplished under
   VMC conditions and with an IP at a set of functional aircraft controls. During simulated
   engine failure operations, aircraft will be wings level in a position to execute a safe landing
   no lower than 100 feet AGL.
      9.7.2.1. Initiate simulated engine failure no lower than 200 feet AGL or approach
      minimums if during an instrument approach. The IP will initiate the emergency. The IP
      will set the PCL to a setting equivalent to a feathered propeller once the flying pilot
      correctly executes/applies the proper actions for the simulated emergency procedure.
      9.7.2.2. A go-around will be directed by the IP if a safe landing is not ensured. At
      direction of a go-around, the simulated emergency will be terminated and the PF will use
      power as required to safely climb away from the ground and clear all obstacles. The IP
      will direct a go-around during a simulated engine out approach at 100 feet AGL if the
      aircraft is not stabilized in a safe position to land, the airspeed is slower than centered
      AOA, or that landing gear does not indicate ―Down, Three Green.‖
      9.7.2.3. Aircrew will initiate simulated engine failure after takeoff (turn-back) training
      no lower than 800 feet AGL. Aircrew will initiate simulated engine failure after takeoff
      (straight-ahead) training no lower than 500 feet AGL. For straight-ahead training, the IP
      will study the area ahead of the aircraft for hazards and obstacles prior to the mission. If
      the aircraft cannot safely return to the airfield, the IP will terminate the maneuver and
      direct a go-around no lower than 100 feet AGL.
   9.7.3. Off-Airfield Simulated Forced Landings. Simulated forced landings outside the
   airfield environment due to simulated engine malfunction/failure and other emergencies will
AFI11-2U-28V3 6 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                    65


   only be accomplished in VMC under VFR. The IP will initiate the simulated emergency to
   practice a forced landing only in an area previously studied by the IP for hazards and
   obstacles. The IP will terminate the simulated forced landing and direct a go-around no
   lower than 100 feet AGL during the day and 200 feet AGL at night.
   9.7.4. Aborted Takeoff. Authorized during day or night VMC, or with NVGs. Crosswind
   component must not exceed 75% of the maximum demonstrated crosswinds listed in the
   aircraft POH. The runway must be dry, a minimum width of 60 feet, and long enough to
   meet normal takeoff distance requirements. Initiate the abort by stating ―REJECT‖ before
   rotation speed.
   9.7.5. When conducting Manual Override Lever (MOR) operations, the IP will ensure the
   MOR is properly secured upon landing and before power is applied using the PCL.
9.8. Touch-and-Go/Stop-and-Go Operations.
   9.8.1. Conduct touch-and-Go operations IAW the POH Checklists.                     Touch-and-Go
   operations require two qualified pilots or an IP if the other pilot is unqualified or noncurrent.
      9.8.1.1. The Touch-and-Go Checklists may be used when performing multiple
      instrument approaches or VFR patterns practice at the same airport or transitioning to
      another airport within 25 NM. Pilots will complete the Climb, Cruise, Descent, and
      Before Landing Checklists after the initial takeoff or if transiting to another airfield
      greater than 25 NM from the airport where instrument-approach or VFR-pattern practice
      was accomplished.      WARNING: Runway less than Takeoff Total Distance may not
      guarantee obstacle clearance.
      9.8.1.2. When conducting Stop-and-Go operations and the Condition Lever is set to
      Ground Idle for ground operations, the PNF will verify the Condition Lever is set to
      Flight Idle prior to PCL advancement for takeoff power setting.
   9.8.2. Wet Runways. Stop-and-go or Touch-and-go operations are prohibited when
   crosswinds exceed 75% of the maximum demonstrated crosswinds listed in the POH.
   9.8.3. Icy Runways.      Stop-and-Go or Touch-and-Go operations are prohibited on icy
   runways.
   9.8.4. Ceiling and visibility Runway Visibility Range must be at least 300 feet and ¾ mile.
9.9. NVG Operations. NVG training illumination requirements are the same as outlined in
Chapter 5. NVG instrument approach weather minimums are the minimums for the approach.

       COMBAT SYSTEMS OFFICER SPECIFIC OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES

11.1. General. In addition to the duties established in applicable AFM/POH and other
directives for U-28 aircraft requiring a CSO, the CSO will comply with the procedures and duties
in this chapter. These items need not be briefed and will be performed as normal procedures.
The PIC may assign other duties as necessary.
11.2. Preflight Duties.
   11.2.1. Review the planning products (i.e. TOLD, Comm Card, etc.) to ensure they match
   the mission tasking.
   11.2.2. Carry and operate SKL and portable media drives.
   11.2.3. Intel Coordination. Coordinate with Intel to determine threats, EEIs, and any other
   required mission specific details prior to the flight.
   11.2.4. Training Missions. The instructors will normally develop the mission scenario. If no
   instructor is on-board, the CSO is responsible for scenario development.
       11.2.4.1. The CSO should coordinate with opposing force/mission ready training
       (OPFOR/MRT) members to develop a scenario that meets the training requirements of all
       participants. Specific areas to be covered include, but are not limited to, communications
       plan, specific mission events to be included in the scenario, and deconfliction with other
       players.
11.3. In-flight Duties.
   11.3.1. Communications. Monitor the primary ATC radio unless otherwise directed by the
   aircraft commander. Record ATC clearances and monitor the read back during departure,
   en-route, and approach. This procedure is not required when ATC instructions require
   immediate execution by the pilot, or when such action interferes with the timely performance
   of other time-sensitive duties.
   11.3.2. Mission Systems. Operate applicable mission systems in accordance with the U-28
   Mission Operators Handbook. Brief pilot on any mission system that is not fully functioning.
   11.3.3. Taxi. When duties permit, visually clear during ground operations.
   11.3.4. Departure and Approach Monitoring. Immediately after takeoff, cross-check

                          OPERATIONAL REPORTS AND FORMS

12.1. General. This chapter contains a description of applicable reports and forms. For
assistance in completing safety forms contact the wing/group, unit, or local flight safety officer.
12.2. AFSOC FORM 97, Aircraft Incident Worksheet. Refer to AFI 91-204, Safety
Investigations and Reports, and the AFSOC Sup. The Safety Office (HQ AFSOC/SE) will be
notified of the following high interest items: insertion injuries, IFR incidents, dropped objects, or
any other incident which, in the judgment of the Flight Safety Officer, needs to be reported. Use
the AFSOC FORM 97, Aircraft Incident Worksheet, when reporting these incidents to HQ
AFSOC/SE. AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, and the AFSOC Sup provide policy
guidance that is common to investigating and reporting all US Air Force mishaps and
instructions for using AFSOC FORM 97, Aircraft Incident Worksheet. Safety investigations and
reports are conducted and written solely to prevent future mishaps. Safety investigations take
priority over any corresponding legal investigations, except friendly fire mishaps.
12.3. AF IMT 457, USAF Hazard Report. Refer to AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap
Prevention Program. The USAF hazard reporting system provides a means for Air Force
personnel to alert supervisors and commanders to hazardous conditions requiring prompt
corrective action. A hazard is any condition, act, or circumstance that jeopardizes or may
jeopardize the health and well being of personnel, or which may result in loss, damage, or
destruction of any weapons system, equipment, facility, or material resource.
12.4. AF IMT 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR). Refer to AFI 91-202, The US Air
Force Mishap Prevention Program, Attachment 3.
   12.4.1. The Air Force HATR program provides a means for personnel to report all near
   midair collisions and alleged hazardous air traffic conditions. Use information in HATR
   reports only for mishap prevention. AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention
   Program, list reportable incidents.
   12.4.2. Procedures:
       12.4.2.1. Make an airborne report of the hazardous condition to the nearest ATC agency
       (e.g., center, FSS, control tower, or aeronautical radio station), and give the following

  circumstances impacting their missions. Examples of reportable events include meaconing,
  jamming, intrusion, interception, fuel dumping, loss of multiple engines, hostile fire, injury to
  passengers or crew members, etc. This list is not exhaustive. Some events may require the
  C2 agency to forward OPREP reports to higher headquarters. The old adage, ―when in
  doubt, report it,‖ applies.

                                    EQUAL TIME POINT

A2.1. Equal Time Point. The equal time point is an airborne decision point. It is the point
along the route of flight (usually over water) from which it takes the same amount of time to
return to the point of departure (or to the last suitable airfield) as it would to continue to the
destination (or the first suitable airfield). In no wind conditions, the ETP is simply the halfway
point between the two airfields. However, when flying into a headwind, the ETP moves closer to
the destination aerodrome. Conversely, when flying into a tailwind, the ETP moves closer to the
departure aerodrome. These calculations will also be impacted by the decision to fly at lower
altitudes due to loss of aircraft pressurization without supplemental oxygen. The distance and
time to the ETP from the departure aerodrome (or last suitable airfield) may be calculated using
the following formulas:
           Distance to ETP =        (Total Distance) x (Ground Speed Home)
                                  (Ground Speed Out) + (Ground Speed Home)
           Time to ETP        =                 Distance to ETP
                                                Ground Speed Out
