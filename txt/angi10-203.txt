Air National Guard as well as the posturing of forces in accordance with Mission Design Series
(MDS) specific Special Instructions (SPINS) and AFI 11-202, Vol 3, General Flight Rules.
1. General Information.
     1.1. ANG forces perform non-contingency alert missions in support of air sovereignty, aerial
     refueling, search and rescue, and airlift missions. ANG forces also perform alert missions for
     contingency operations. Commanders are responsible for managing and ensuring lawful
     execution of the alert mission resources in accordance with all governing directives on this
     subject. Attachment 1 of this document provides reference to governing directives.
2. Non-Contingency Command and Control.
     2.1. ANG aircrew and ground support personnel can perform non-contingency alert duty in
     Title 32 FTNGD-OS, Title 32 Active Guard/Reserve (AGR) and Title 10. Air National
     Guard aircrew and maintenance personnel supporting alert will not sit alert in technician
     status. Commanders should refer to NGB-J1-TN guidance for technicians performing
     military duty.
        2.1.1. Title 32 AGR members may perform alert duties if the performance of such duty
        does not interfere with their purpose for organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing
        or training the reserve component.
     2.2. Provisions will be made to ensure members automatically convert to Title 10, if a
     specific Title 10 trigger is included in higher headquarters guidance. In accordance with 10
     U.S.C., 12301(d), members performing alert duties must sign a Title 10 consent statement
     prior to performing alert duty. Units will keep and maintain signed consent forms for all
     personnel that perform alert duty. See Attachment 2 for an example.
        2.2.1. IAW ANGI 36-101, Air National Guard Active Guard/Reserve (AGR) Program,
        AGRs called or ordered to Title 10 federal active duty (OCONUS/CONUS) supporting
        Active Duty requirements for operations/missions/exercises/training (Title 10 U.S.C.
        12301(d), 12302, 12304, or 10147) will not be terminated from their Title 32 U.S.C.
        Section 502(f) orders. Commanders will comply with the administrative documentation,
        reporting and reimbursement requirements of ANG 36-101, Chapter 7 when AGR
        resources support active duty requirements. Commanders will follow the same rule set
        for members on FTNGD-OS tours called to Title 10 duty.
     2.3. Units will have Title 10 activation authority on-file for the alert mission being
     performed. This authority will be documented on Title 32 orders for the stated alert mission.
     Memorandums between gaining Title 10 authority and State officials are required.
     2.4. Major Commands (MAJCOMs), Numbered Air Forces (NAFs), Joint Force
     Headquarters (JFHQs) and NGB/A3 will coordinate a Memorandum of Understanding
     (MOU) with ANG units detailing the scope of operational direction Active Duty Title 10
     commanders may exercise over Title 32 ANG members performing alert duty in support of
     federal missions.
     2.5. Federal funds provided for duty under the authority of Title 32 are provided to the ANG
     for the purpose of organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing or training. Reviewing
     alert procedures, aircraft preflight and training in other aspects of the alert mission fulfills
     this requirement for accomplishing training during the alert order or duty period.

       the State United States Property & Fiscal Office (USPFO). The USPFO will complete an
       annual audit of alert schedules to ensure compliance with NGB-J1 guidance on
       technicians performing military duty, conformity requirements outlined in AFI 36-3003
       Military Leave Program, ANGI 36-101 Air National Guard Active Guard Reserve (AGR)
       Program and this instruction.
       3.1.2. NGB/A3 and CONR-1AF(AFNORTH)/A3V will be responsible for ensuring unit

       Rules.
   3.2. IAW USC Title 37, Sec 204 commanders will ensure that all members report to their
   assigned ANG unit on the first day of an order when performing alert duties. Commanders
   are responsible for publication of an alert duty schedule for the period of published orders
   supporting an alert mission. At a minimum, the alert duty schedule must meet duty
   requirements outlined in AFI 11-202, Vol 3, General Flight Rules, the pass and leave
   requirements in AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program and ANGI 36-2001, Management of
   Training and Operational Support within the Air National Guard.
   3.3. During the period of an alert duty order, a commander may award regular and special
   passes in accordance with AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program. Pass time will not exceed
   the parameters listed in AFI 36-3003. Under no circumstance will orders be published or

   correspond with the alert mission being supported. These records will be maintained for
   seven fiscal years not including the current fiscal year. The current fiscal year records must
   also be maintained.
   3.5. Personnel performing alert duty in an alert facility may require short-term temporary
   relief for a period of less than four hours. Qualified personnel in an authorized military duty

5. Workday Guidance.
     5.1. Current alert posture is resourced only for ground alert at current levels and real-world
     scrambles. Any requirements beyond a steady state posture are considered contingency and
     will be resourced by the active duty gaining MAJCOM.
     5.2. Alert units will receive a finite amount of annual funding and workdays. Commanders
     are responsible for mission execution in order to complete the fiscal year (FY) without
     additional resources.
     5.3. NGB Requirements Programming Branch (NGB/A8P) programs resources to support
     Title 32 ground alert and the rescue alert mission requirements. NGB Financial Management
     (NGB/FM) and NGB/A3 will work closely together to ensure available resources are
     adequately distributed to alert units in order to best execute mission requirements.
     5.4. NGB/A3 manages Title 32 workday resources to support fighter, airlift, personnel
     recovery and aerial refueling alert missions. Units will return unused workdays to the
     appropriate NGB/A3 workday manager. Some units may perform alert missions on a short-
     term, non-steady state basis. Workday resources required for these short-term requirements
     will be secured and managed by NGB/A3 through the Active Duty gaining MAJCOM. The
     type of workday resources provided for the alert missions may also vary. The guidance in
     this section regarding Workday Guidance applies to all ANG alert duty being performed
     regardless of the type of workday resource being used.
     5.5. ANGI 36-2001, Management of Training and Operational Support within the Air
     National Guard applies to the administration of Title 10 Active Duty for Operational Support
     (ADOS) and Title 32 Full Time National Guard Duty for FTNGD-OS resources for alert
     missions.
     5.6. Workday resources for alert will be used in direct support of alert operations. Units will
     not use alert workdays for members that do not perform the specific alert mission. Workday
     allocations are based on the AFSC for which the workdays are appropriated. Other training
     (i.e. CMR requirements) and duties not directly related to the tasked alert mission may be
     accomplished on alert workdays provided the member participates in the alert mission during
     the duration of their alert orders. Members shall not impede the execution of the alert
     mission IAW AFI 11-202, Vol. 3 and the applicable MAJCOM supplements.
     5.7. Commanders have the responsibility and the flexibility to execute the alert mission with
     the workday resources provided for the authorized alert postures. Commanders will not
     posture members for duty in a non-pay status.
        5.7.1. Authorized Alert Postures
            5.7.1.1. Response Posture Immediate. An alert mission that requires an immediate
            response that mandates aircrew remains at the alert duty location to meet mission
            requirements. Members must report for duty IAW the MAJCOM /NAF directed
            response requirement and the Wing commander directed duty schedule for the
            immediate posture duty period.
            5.7.1.2. Response Posture Tailored. An alert mission that does not require an
            immediate response and/or the alert crew is not required to remain at the alert duty
            location (pager/telephone alert) after reporting for duty. Members must be

        MAJCOM. Members must report for duty IAW the MAJCOM /NAF directed
        response requirement and the Wing commander directed duty schedule for the
        tailored posture duty period.
        5.7.1.3. On-Call Search and Rescue (SAR) Alaska. In the absence of a Drill Status
        Guardsman volunteer and in accordance with 32 U.S.C., 709 the commander of the
        176th Wing may schedule technicians to fill an on-call alert requirement during the
        period of the normal scheduled technician workday for a military or civilian SAR
        alert commitment. Technicians must volunteer to be the on-call SAR resource.
        Technicians who volunteer for the on-call SAR requirement will not be scheduled to
        accrue compensatory time or overtime pay during the on-call alert duty period.
        Under no circumstance will a commander authorize compensatory time for alert duty.
        Technicians utilized as an on-call alert resource will convert to a Title 10 active duty
        status upon notification of a flight duty mission requirement, in accordance with the
        specific Title 10 authority included in higher headquarters guidance and with the
        coordination of the Alaska State Governor.
           5.7.1.3.1. Absent a hardened alert facility, the commander of the 176th Wing
           may direct aircrew and maintenance personnel on alert orders in a Title 32
           FTNGD-OS or Title 10 ADOS (provided that the AD gaining MAJCOM has
           provided authority) status to sit ready alert at an alternate duty location. This
           includes their legal residence if the location accommodates the directed response
           times. The 176th Wing Commander may direct personnel to an alternate duty
           location after they report for duty on the first day of the active duty order. The
           176th Wing will conduct alert in accordance with the signed Memorandum of
           Understanding between the Alaska National Guard and 11th AF (PACAF)
           concerning Search and Rescue Support.
