OPR: HQ AU/CFAE                           Certified by: HQ AU/CF (Dr. Bruce T. Murphy)
Supersedes AUI 36-2306, 24 September 2007                                      Pages: 8

This instruction implements policies and procedures contained in AFI 36-2301, Developmental
Education, AFMAN 36-2234, Instructional System Development; AFH 36-2235, Volume 10,
Information for Designers of Instructional Systems Application to Education; AFMAN 36-2236,
Guidebook for Air Force Instructors; AUI 36-2312, Air University Assessment Programs, and
AUI 36-2617, Degree Granting, Accreditation, Reaffirmation, and Substantive Change. This
policy describes an academic corporate process consistent with AETCI 16-501, Corporate
Structure, and differentiates between the requirement to conduct academic program reviews at
the Center and at the Headquarters AU levels. This instruction applies to all AU Centers,
institutes, and schools (hereafter referred to as Center). Where certain authorities are delegated
to the Centers, ultimate responsibility for programs remains with the AU Commander and
President. Submit suggested changes or corrections to the OPR using the AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication, to the OPR through the appropriate chain of
command. Affected organizations may develop local publications to implement/supplement
guidance contained in this instruction. Submit draft local publications to HQ AU/CFAE for
coordination prior to approval. Provide a copy of approved local publications to HQ AU/CFAE.
Waivers to guidance in this publication are not authorized.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This is a new instruction. It replaces AUI 36-2306, Education Program Review Boards. It
establishes the Air University Academic Corporate Process and subsequent to that, the AU
Academic Council as the oversight body to inform the AU Commander and President about
academic programs and their effectiveness, and university-wide accountability.

1. Purpose.

   1.1. This instruction establishes the Air University Academic Corporate Process to address
   items affecting the education enterprise. Examples include but are not limited to
   organizational structure, instructional delivery methods and platforms, curriculum
   integration, curriculum injects and other issues involving external stakeholders, academic
2                                                            AUI36-2606 22 OCTOBER 2013

    support processes, enterprise IT solutions, and prioritization of resources that support
    strategic decisions.

    1.2. AU employs a corporate process having a hierarchical structure composed of: chartered
    working groups able to study specific issues in depth; a regularly constituted and scheduled
    Academic Board to deliberate issues affecting the institution; and an Academic Council that
    receives information and recommendations from the Academic Board for final disposition.
    The AU/CC may commission special reviews. Use of this process ensures university-wide
    academic effectiveness and accountability. The AU academic corporate process is designed
    to advance the AU mission through standardization of university-wide academic processes
    where appropriate, to benchmark best educational practices, to monitor compliance with
    applicable AU, USAF, DOD, and joint guidance, and to monitor compliance with joint,
    regional, professional accreditation guidelines.

2. Roles and Responsibilities

    2.1. Air University Commander and President (AU/CC)

       2.1.1. The AU/CC is responsible for executing all AU academic programs and courses to
       meet Air Force educational development requirements.

    2.2. Academic Affairs (AU/CF)

       2.2.1. The Vice President for Academic Affairs (VPAA) is the senior leader responsible
       for academic affairs (AU/CF). The VPAA is the AU/CCâ€™s chief advisor for educational
       matters. The VPAA serves as the principal authority on instructional methods for the
       university, is the architect of the AU continuum of education strategic guidance and
       advises the AU/CC on review and selection of key faculty members. The VPAA is the
       AU liaison to Air Staff and other external agencies for curriculum content matters but
       may delegate staff work as appropriate.

       2.2.2. Academic Affairs Directorate (AU/CFA).           The Associate Vice President
       Academic Affairs (AVPAA) ensures AU programs meet requirements of external
       stakeholders and oversight bodies and is the Air University liaison to the Southern
       Association of Colleges and Schools. The AVPAA serves as an advisory member on all
       Center or school academic review boards or meetings. The AVPAA ensures regular
       meetings of the AU Academic Board and Council are convened; AU level working
       groups are chartered; POCs report the status of progress at Academic Board meetings;
       and appropriate topics are elevated to the Council. The AVPAA also engages as a liaison
       for university issues with the AF/A1D, J7, and other bodies as appropriate.

       2.2.3. AU Academic Affairs (AU/CFA) is the action officer for Board and Council

AUI36-2606       22 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 3

      2.3.1. Attend all meetings and actively participate. Come prepared by reviewing read-
      aheads and ascertaining the status/position of your schools and Centers on topics under
      discussion. Provide appropriate representation to AU working groups. If the assigned
      member cannot attend, send a substitute who can speak authoritatively and
      knowledgeably for the school or Center on the agenda topics.

3. Process

   3.1. Working groups (WG). Working groups may be established at the university or Center
   level by the appropriate senior leader to accomplish the AU educational mission. Working
   group membership should include personnel with the expertise and diverse perspectives
   necessary to provide comprehensive and broad-based support to the issue under study.
   Faculty members will be included in working groups that affect curriculum content,
   instruction and/or program delivery. Schools or units directly affected by the decisions of the
   group should make every effort to have a key representative at every meeting.

      3.1.1. University-level working groups address issues that cut across the university or
      involve more than one Center. The OPR for university-level working groups resides at
      the university level, led by HQ AU/CFA or the appropriate HQ/AU A-staff directorate.
      These groups should include representatives from across the university to leverage
      corporate knowledge, to ensure all affected schools have a voice at the table; and to share
      information and best practices. Examples of working group focus areas include, but are
      not limited to, institutional effectiveness, curriculum management, educational support
      and technology, and faculty development.

             3.1.1.1. Long-term university-level WGs should have a formal charter approved by
             the establishing authority which designates the chairperson and describes the purpose,
             meeting frequency, membership, and anticipated outcomes of the group to include
             how any recommendations will be addressed (i.e., corporate board, etc). The WG
             chairperson will publish minutes to its members. The WG will provide slides or other
             materials to AU/CFAE as read-aheads for their presentation within 3 duty days of
             each Academic Board meeting.

                3.1.1.1.1. The Education Support Working group (ESWG), chaired by the
                Director (or designee) of AU/A3/6, is a standing university-level WG, chartered
                to provide ET/IT-based recommendations for university-wide technology support
                requirements. Membership is comprised of representatives from AU/CFA,
                AU/CFR, HQ/AU A-staff, School of Advance Air and Space Studies (SAASS),
                Air Force Research Institute (AFRI) and all academic Centers. The ESWG
                reports the status of activities at each Academic Board meeting and to the
                Academic Council as needed.

             3.1.1.2. Ad hoc or short-term WGs may simply meet and report on progress at each
             Academic Board meeting. They will provide agendas and read-aheads within 3 duty
             days prior to the Academic Board if needed for their presentation. Their progress will
             be captured in the minutes.

    review of the appropriateness and impact of proposed new topics to the AU curriculum,
    selection of enterprise educational technology applications, emerging requirements, resource
    allocation, organizational structure, and other issues related to academic programs. Topics
    brought before the Board should require corporate consideration and resolution, as well as
    those that provide awareness of issues that may affect the AU education mission. The Board

4. Academic Program Review.

   4.1. Center-level Academic Program Reviews. Center commanders will direct periodic
   internal reviews of all academic programs IAW AUI 36-2312, Air University Assessment
   Programs. Reviews should be integrated with each Centerâ€™s academic calendar. Center
   commanders will establish a review schedule most appropriate for the academic programs
   within their respective Centers, but each academic program should be formally reviewed at
   least biennially.

      4.1.1. Center-level program reviews should address, at minimum: 1) the degree to which
      academic program level outcomes were achieved, 2) a program-level summary of student
      and faculty evaluation and feedback data, 3) proposed program improvements and
      changes for the coming year(s), 4) results of program changes from the previous year,
      5) assessment of faculty development efforts, 6) the degree to which AF, DOD, joint, and
      other pertinent requirements were met, 7) resource and support issues that impacted or
      are predicted to impact the educational mission, and 8) accomplishment of Center
      commander strategic guidance. Additionally, academic program reviews may focus on
      contemporary issues impacting content, delivery and/or outcomes, thus Center academic
      program reviews should anticipate potential challenges, risks, and opportunities.

      4.1.2. Executive summaries of Center academic program reviews will be provided to
      AU/CFAE within 10 working days of the program review. If program review
      presentation slides are sufficiently detailed, they can be provided in lieu of an executive
      summary. A short memo/email on the disposition of program change recommendations
      should be attached with the slides.
