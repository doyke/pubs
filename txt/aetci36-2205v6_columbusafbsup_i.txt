1.1. Introduction. HQ AETC conducts graduate-level fighter training courses to provide
qualified aircrew to the combat air forces (CAF) and to sustain FTU operations. Each training
course produces fighter aircrew with basic proficiency in air-to-air and air-to-surface mission
tasks applicable to each aircraft and mission. Each flying training course syllabus outlines
graduation status, training location, course entry prerequisites, and provides a summary of
training. The Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA) website at
https://etca.randolph.af.mil/ also provides student administration and processing guidance.
1.2. Responsibilities:
   1.2.1. HQ AETC/A2/3/10:

    1.2.6. Registrar:
       1.2.6.1. Obtains class entry rosters in the Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) not
       later than 2 weeks before class entry. Note: Entries for ENJJPT IFF non-USAF students
       should be obtained from each country’s senior national representative 2 weeks prior to
       the class start date. Units without access to MilPDS should obtain class entry rosters from
       NGB/A3TC and forward the roster to HQ AETC/A3RA within 30 duty days of scheduled
       class arrival. Rosters should be obtained as early as possible to allow identification of
       excess capacity. After reviewing the class rosters, the registrar:
           1.2.6.1.1. Notifies HQ AETC/A3RA if there is a deviation in the expected quotas.
           1.2.6.1.2. Contacts HQ AETC/A3RA and HQ AFPC/DPAOT to allow a fill of excess
           capacity if identified with adequate lead time. Note: In some units, the squadron
           operations officer (SQ/DO) works closely with the registrar in order to accomplish
           the duties listed in this paragraph.
       1.2.6.2. Reports roster discrepancies as soon as they are discovered, but no later than 3
       days following the class start date. Reports changes, discrepancies, and graduation delays
       to HQ AETC/A3RA, HQ AETC/A3RB, NGB/A3OC, 19 AF/DOG, 19 AF/DO,
AETCI36-2205V6_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 25 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                  7


       AETC/A3G, and AETC/A3H. With NGB approval, students awaiting training may be
       entered in an earlier class.
       1.2.6.3. Updates MilPDS no later than 3 duty days after class graduation date. Note:
       ANG units have MilPDS access; however, this access is limited and requires these units
       to coordinate with active duty military personnel flights with respect to active duty
       students.
       1.2.6.4. Withdraws students from training if a correct active duty service commitment
       cannot be established and documented according to AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service
       Commitments (ADSC), or service commitment date (SCD) established according to
       ANGI 36-2101, Assignments Within The Air National Guard.
       1.2.6.5. Immediately notifies the host aviation resource management office when any
       student is removed from training according to AFI 11-402.

       database with the proper elimination code.
       1.2.6.8. Distributes records of eliminated officers and maintains them according to the
       RDS.
1.3. Training Syllabus. The syllabus is directive and must be followed precisely unless a
waiver is approved according to Chapter 2.
   1.3.1. Syllabus Interpretation. If no clear syllabus guidance exists, resolve the situation
   using the appropriate chain of command. Only the OPR may interpret syllabus guidance. If
   the logical course of action appears to conflict with other directives, call the OPR listed in the
   syllabus.
   1.3.2. Sortie and Hour Requirements. Each syllabus has a programmed number of sorties,
   flying hours, refly rates, and additional sortie authorizations. Unless otherwise specified in
   the syllabus, additional sorties required beyond the course limit must have 19 AF/DO
   approval. (For ANG students, NGB/A3T is the approval authority. HQ AFRC/A3T is
   approval authority for AFRC students.) Proficiency advancement is defined in the applicable
   syllabus. It will not be used as a management tool for purposes of graduating students by a
   specific date.
   1.3.3. Cockpit Resource Management (CRM) Requirements. The AETC supplement to
   AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program, outlines requirements
   for the CRM training program. CRM briefings will discuss the human-factor causes in
   aircraft mishaps. Use real-world mishaps as examples in the briefings. Brief and debrief
   CRM core concepts and skills on every aircraft and simulator mission. According to AFI 11-
   290, ANG FTUs will use ANG-approved CRM training.
1.4. Course Training Standards (CTS). If the CTS document is published separately, a
glossary defining acronyms and terms in the CTS may be applied to all applicable syllabuses.
1.5. Aircrew Graduate Evaluation Program. Formal training graduates who attend follow-on
training in IFF and during training at a fighter FTU receive a graduate evaluation from the FTU
 8                        AETCI36-2205V6_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 25 SEPTEMBER 2012


at the supervisory feedback capture point identified in the syllabus. Fighter FTU graduates may
receive a graduate evaluation from the operational unit. Syllabuses may specify if graduate
evaluations are not required.
1.6. Training Folders (Grade Books):
     1.6.1. Training folders, either paper or electronic, may be referred to as grade books. Each
     student will have a grade book containing grade sheets and other documentation as defined
     by the specific syllabus, applicable AFI 11-2MDS-specific volumes, and local guidance.
     Units may use, in whole or in part, electronic media (such as the Graduate Training
     Management System [GTMS], Graduate Training Integration Management System
     [GTIMS], Training Integration Management System [TIMS], or the F-35 Training
     Management System [TMS]) to fulfill this requirement.
     1.6.2. Grade books are property of the US Air Force. Unit personnel must safeguard them at
     all times. Loss or destruction of these documents could subject the member to adverse
     administrative action, as well as possible prosecution under the Uniform Code of Military
     Justice (UCMJ). Squadron personnel will brief students on potential adverse administrative
     actions.
1.7. Student Scheduling. Students will not perform duties in excess of a 12-hour flight duty
period. Exception: AFI 11-202, Volume 3, General Flight Rules, may prescribe a shorter flight
duty period.
1.8. Production Metrics Report. HQ AETC/A3RB is the point of contact (POC) for flying
training production metrics. At the beginning of each fiscal year, HQ AETC/A3RB uploads the
programmed flying training document to the flying training production analysis (FTPA) web-
based input tool. The group commander or designated POC will update the FTPA with actual
entries, gains, losses, attritions, graduate numbers, and notes, if applicable. These updates are
due 5 duty days after the class start date and class graduation date.
1.9. Distinguished Graduate (DG):
     1.9.1. Units with a DG program will recognize basic course students who clearly excel
     during formal training. Formalize the DG program in local guidance. DGs must demonstrate
     outstanding progress in each phase of academic, simulator, and flying training, and
     outstanding results in flying and simulator evaluations. The unit commander is the final
     approval authority for all awards.
     1.9.2. Units will develop their own method of identifying up to the top 10 percent of students
     per class as DGs; classes of fewer than 10 may have 1 DG. Any fractions may be rounded
     upward. Commanders may elect not to designate a DG in a class.
     1.9.3. Annotate DG on individual’s AF IMT 475, Education/Training Report, and include
     the annotated form in the individual’s permanent record.
     1.9.4. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) The FLT/CC selects DGs through discussion with
     fellow instructors. The SQ/CC has final approval authority on DG selection. DG selection is
     not required if no students in a class perform well above the course training standards and in
     a superior manner compared to their peers.

                              STUDENT ADMINISTRATION

2.1. Course Entry. Unit personnel review incoming student records to verify they are complete
and to determine initial supervision required.
   2.1.1. Initial Student Records Review. As a minimum, unit personnel will review the
   following student records (or equivalent) prior to any formal training other than academic-
   only training courses:
       2.1.1.1. Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF). Students will hand-carry FEFs to training as
       dictated by ETCA requirements. Depending on aircrew specialty, some individuals may
       not yet possess an FEF.
       2.1.1.2. Individual Flight Records/Training Records (Training Folders/Grade
       Books) from Previous Courses. Students will hand-carry records to training as dictated
       by ETCA requirements.
       2.1.1.3. Training Summaries/Student Biographies. The SQ/CC, SQ/DO, flight
       commander (FLT/CC), or designated representative should review all training summaries
       and student biographies to be included in the grade book.
   2.1.2. Prerequisite Entry Waivers. Prerequisite entry waivers may only be approved after
   coordination with the OG/CC. 19 AF/DO ensures proper request staffing for air reserve
   components (ARC) students. Waiver requests will be completed on AETC Form 6, Waiver
   Request, using the following approval process:
       2.1.2.1. For active duty students, 19 AF/DO is approval authority. For ANG students,
       NGB/A3T is approval authority. For AFRC students, HQ AFRC/A3T is approval
       authority. 19 AF/CC must approve all senior officer entry waivers. For all students, 19
       AF/DOG will forward copies of all prerequisite waiver requests to HQ AETC/A3ZF.
       Exception: When an Air Force instruction (AFI) prescribes formal course entry
       prerequisites, follow the AFI’s guidance when determining the waiver authority.
       2.1.2.2. Maintain a permanent record of all approved waivers in the student’s grade
       book.
   2.1.3. Syllabus Waivers. An approved syllabus waiver is required for any planned
   exception to the syllabus caused by special or unusual circumstances. Units will not
   accomplish or omit any training requested in a waiver until notification of approval. Waiver
   authority below the appropriate level is not authorized. Permanent or blanket waivers are not
   authorized. Waiver requests will be completed on AETC Form 6 using the following
   approval process:
       2.1.3.1. For active duty students, 19 AF/DO is approval authority. The 19 AF/DO will
       coordinate with the gaining OG/CC (or equivalent) on waivers or circumstances that will
       delay graduation or increase gaining unit training requirements. 19 AF/CC must approve
       all senior officer waivers.
       2.1.3.2. For ARC students, 19 AF/DO will coordinate ANG and AFRC student waivers
       with NGB/A3T or HQ AFRC/A3T, as appropriate, prior to approval.
 10                     AETCI36-2205V6_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 25 SEPTEMBER 2012


      2.1.3.3. For all students, 19 AF/DOG will forward copies of approved waiver requests to
      the unit, HQ AETC/A3ZF, and the syllabus OPR.
      2.1.3.4. Maintain a permanent record of all approved waivers in the student’s grade
      book.
   2.1.4. Syllabus Deviation. A syllabus deviation is any unplanned variation from syllabus
   requirements such as deviation from course flow. Each student must accomplish all syllabus-
   directed training to the required proficiency level unless a waiver request is approved. If
   unforeseen circumstances result in an omission of required training, the OG/CC may
   authorize accomplishment of the omitted training later in the course as long as it does not
   adversely affect the quality of student training. Document all syllabus deviations, OG/CC-
   directed corrective actions, and the completion of omitted training in the student’s grade
   book.
   2.1.5. Incomplete Training. Rated officers who voluntarily withdraw from a course may
   meet a Flying Evaluation Board, as directed by AFI 11-402 and applicable supplements.
   Forward elimination requests to HQ AETC/A2/3/10 according to AFI 11-402, as
   supplemented.
   2.1.6. Course Completion. Students must complete all syllabus training in order to
   graduate from a course and depart the training unit. Students may not make up training at the
   follow-on unit without an approved syllabus waiver unless specifically noted in the syllabus.
2.2. Training Delays:
   2.2.1. Administrative Hold:
      2.2.1.1. Units with students whose training has been suspended more than 14 calendar
      days will notify 19 AF/DOG.
      2.2.1.2. For ARC students, commanders contact 19 AF/CCG or 19 AF/CCR for
      disposition of students placed on administrative hold.
   2.2.2. Graduation Notification:
      2.2.2.1. When the graduation date changes or it appears a student may graduate late,
      training units will notify the student’s gaining unit, HQ AETC/A3RA, 19 AF/DOG,
      AFPC/DPAOT, and NGB/A3TC or HQ AFRC/A3TB (as applicable, for ARC students),
      by message or electronic mail (email). The unit will also provide the new graduation date,
      when determined, and indicate if any scheduled follow-on training will be impacted. For
      ARC students, the training unit will send an information copy to 19 AF/CCR and
      AETC/A3H or AETC/A3G, as appropriate.
      2.2.2.2. For TDY-to-school funded students (does not apply to students in a permanent
      change of station [PCS] status), the assigned training unit will notify HQ AETC/FMAM
      of any student training delays over 7 calendar days due to wash backs, break in training,
      duty not including flying (DNIF), medical hold, administrative hold, disciplinary action,
      or elimination. Orders must be amended for all delays over 7 calendar days. Commanders
      will work with 19 AF/DO to determine the disposition of these students.
   2.2.3. ANG/AFRC Students Experiencing Difficulty. Units will notify the 19 AF/CCR
   and AETC/A3H or AETC/A3G, as appropriate, via message (19 AF RANDOLPH AFB
AETCI36-2205V6_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 25 SEPTEMBER 2012                                             11


   TX//CCR//) or (AETC/A2/3/10 RANDOLPH AFB TX//A3G//A3H//) or email when an
   ANG or AFRC student requires a progress check (PC), enters the commander's review (CR)
   process, is placed on administrative (reference paragraph 2.2.1.2) or medical hold, or is
   eliminated from or reinstated in training. In addition, notify 19 AF/CCR and AETC/A3H or
   AETC/A3G, as appropriate, when there is reasonable doubt about a student's potential to
   complete syllabus training. Include the student's home unit and NGB/A3T or HQ
   AFRC/A3T, as applicable, as addressees on these messages.
2.3. Conditioning Programs. Units will administer programs outlined in the specific syllabus;
AETCI 11-406, Fighter Aircrew Conditioning Program (FACP), and local OIs. Students will
participate in a scheduled physical training program when required by the syllabus. Students will
document the FACP in the grade book according to the syllabus.

                                          Chapter 3

                                STUDENT MANAGEMENT

3.1. Commander’s Awareness Program (CAP):
   3.1.1. Objective. CAP’s objective is to focus supervisory attention on a student’s progress
   in training, specific deficiencies, and potential to complete the program. CAP may also be
   used to monitor personal issues requiring supervisory attention. CAP is intended as a short-
   term program. A student requiring an extended period of increased supervision or repeated
   placement on CAP should be considered for a PC.
   3.1.2. Categories. Units will place students into one or more of the following categories:
      3.1.2.1. Flying. Students demonstrating flying deficiencies in the aircraft.
          3.1.2.1.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Document G-tolerance or airsickness issues
          under ―Flying‖ CAP.
          3.1.2.1.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) G-CAP. Students completing centrifuge
          training with an acceleration training report grade less than 2, students receiving an
          "Unsatisfactory" score on the FACP test, students who exhibit AGSM deficiencies, or
          students experiencing a G-Incident requiring special attention to their AGSM
          execution and G-tolerance.
          3.1.2.1.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Airsickness CAP. Airsickness CAP is
          defined as students experiencing airsickness problems severe enough to detract from
          mission performance.
      3.1.2.2. Procedural. Students exhibiting substandard general or emergency procedure
      knowledge.
      3.1.2.3. Academic. Students exhibiting substandard academic performance.
      3.1.2.4. Military. Students exhibiting substandard military or professional behavior.
      3.1.2.5. Other. Students with personal issues requiring supervisory attention.
   3.1.3. CAP Procedures:
      3.1.3.1. CAP Placement. The FLT/CC, SQ/DO, SQ/CC, or designated supervisor
      places a student on CAP when substandard performance, personal issues, or lost training
      requires close monitoring of individual progress. A unit supervisor will counsel students
      placed on CAP. Initial counseling will address the reason for CAP placement, CAP
      objectives, student training plan, IP continuity, and CAP removal goals.
      3.1.3.1. (COLUMBUSAFB) Commanders may want to use the following as
      demonstration of substandard performance:
          3.1.3.1.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Demonstrated substandard performance
          during SUPT as documented on AETC Form 1122, Summary Performance Report.
          3.1.3.1.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Two consecutive sorties or simulators graded
          either Effective or Non-Effective for Student Non-Progression (E/NE-SNP).
AETCI36-2205V6_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 25 SEPTEMBER 2012                                              13


        3.1.3.1.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Two sorties or simulators graded E/NE-SNP
        within a phase.
        3.1.3.1.4. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Three total sorties or simulators graded
        E/NE-SNP.
     3.1.3.2. CAP Student Activities. While students are in CAP, units will:
        3.1.3.2.1. Tailor training to address the student’s particular situation within the limits
        of the syllabus.
        3.1.3.2.1. (COLUMBUSAFB) Students on CAP will fly only one syllabus sortie per
        day unless approved by the FLT/CC (with concurrence from the SQ/CC or DO).
        Note: Syllabus simulators do not count towards the one sortie per day, and Non-
        syllabus sorties are highly encouraged.
        3.1.3.2.2. Closely monitor instructor continuity.
        3.1.3.2.2. (COLUMBUSAFB) Students on CAP will fly with the student’s assigned
        FLT/CC or one of four primary IPs as assigned by the FLT/CC. CAP students may
        fly with other Squadron Supervisors with SQ/CC approval. This restriction applies
        only to IP of Record, not Direct Support.
        3.1.3.2.3. Not compromise proficiency standards to permit CAP students to progress
        in training. Additional sorties to clear flight deficiencies are not to exceed those
        authorized by the syllabus.
        3.1.3.2.4. Provide additional counseling as required. Additional counseling is done at
        the discretion of immediate supervisors but is required if students fail to meet the
        CAP removal goal.
        3.1.3.2.5. Update any intermediate goals and CAP removal goals appropriately.
        3.1.3.2.6. Regularly brief squadron leadership on a CAP student’s progress toward
        CAP removal. This briefing should include student’s strong and weak areas and CAP
        removal criteria.
        3.1.3.2.7. Immediate supervisors will maintain documentation of all counseling in the
        student’s grade book. However, the details of the counseling will be included in end-
        of-course training reports, if appropriate.
        3.1.3.2.8. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) The following procedures apply to G-CAP
        students:
            3.1.3.2.8.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Upon initial placement on G-CAP,
            refer the student to Physiologist or FS for physical conditioning and AGSM
            counseling.
            3.1.3.2.8.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) The FLT/CC will review the student’s
            Physical Fitness Log weekly.
            3.1.3.2.8.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) The FLT/CC and the Physiologist or
            FS (if available) will conduct a HUD tape AGSM review on F-2, OB-1, and/or
            any other sortie deemed necessary by the FLT/CC, Physiologist or FS.
 14                      AETCI36-2205V6_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 25 SEPTEMBER 2012


              3.1.3.2.8.4. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) IPs must emphasize AGSM use and
              instruction during all flight briefings and debriefings, and also make a comment
              on every sortie gradesheet regarding AGSM performance until the student is
              removed from G-CAP.
              3.1.3.2.8.5. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Students will not fly solo on air-to-air
              missions while on G-CAP.
       3.1.3.3. CAP Removal. SQ/CC will remove students from CAP when the student meets
       CAP removal goals; the student demonstrates sustained normal progress or resolves
       personal issues. Removal should not be strictly event based, particularly when individual
       weak areas can carry over into the next phase or module. Immediate supervisors counsel
       students when they are removed from CAP.
          3.1.3.3.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Students may be removed from G-CAP with
          concurrence of FLT/CC and Physiologist or FS if they have met CAP removal goals.
          The SQ/CC will consider G-CAP students for Commander Directed Acceleration
          Training if G-CAP removal goals are not met.
3.2. Commander’s Review Process. This process determines whether to continue, modify, or
terminate training. Each syllabus is unique, which may require different review criteria and
procedures. However, use the following guidance unless otherwise directed:
   3.2.1. General. The CR process attempts to resolve training deficiencies at the lowest
   practical level and ensure significant substandard performance is brought to leadership’s
   attention. The intent is to allow students to continue in training until their ability to complete
   the course comes into question. Each syllabus provides additional guidance on causes for
   elimination.
       3.2.1.1. Commanders will thoroughly review a student’s training and progress prior to a
       PC. In addition, the OG/CC, 19 AF/DO, NGB/A3TC, and HQ AFRC/A3T will review
       the student’s training at points specified in Figure 3.1.
       3.2.1.2. OG/CC review must be completed within 5 duty days.
AETCI36-2205V6_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 25 SEPTEMBER 2012                                            15


Figure 3.1. CR Process.




   3.2.2. Progress Check. A PC is a unit commander’s instrument to assess a student’s overall
   flying skills and potential to meet syllabus and CAF requirements. The SQ/CC may direct a
   PC at any time and should consider a PC for sustained substandard performance or doubtful
   potential to complete formal training. The student must meet CTS for that mission in order to
   continue in training.
      3.2.2.1. A PC can result in the student passing and continuing in training, passing with
      additional training recommended before continuing with the normal syllabus flow, or
      elimination from the course. Squadron supervisors will fly PCs. Flying PCs are
      considered instructional sorties.
      3.2.2.2. Designate PC sorties in accordance with syllabus guidance. Schedule any
      student who fails a flying ―XX‖ sortie for a flying PC.
      3.2.2.3. The SQ/CC may direct training device PCs any time student performance
      warrants consideration for elimination. Device PCs will be conducted by a flight
      examiner or contract instructor and observed by an operations officer or above who will
      decide whether the student should continue training. The student must meet CTS to
      continue training.
      3.2.2.4. PC ground evaluations may be conducted as a result of unsatisfactory general
      knowledge/emergency procedures knowledge or as the result of a FLT/CC-directed
 16                      AETCI36-2205V6_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 25 SEPTEMBER 2012


       evaluation for failure to meet syllabus standards in procedural knowledge. The ground
       evaluation is not a collaborative effort. In all cases, only the designated PC instructor
       conducts the briefing, ground evaluation execution, debriefing, and assigns the overall
       grade.
       3.2.2.5. A PC is incomplete only if the mission tasks and objectives could not be
       completed and a reasonable evaluation of student performance could not be made. Do not
       incomplete an aircraft PC for nonflying or ground items with a recommendation that
       additional ground events be administered by another qualified PC instructor to determine
       the outcome of the PC.
3.3. Student Eliminations. The syllabus addresses various causes for elimination. These causes
include academics, flying, training device, and G-tolerance. In addition:
   3.3.1. Students should be eliminated if they:
       3.3.1.1. Exhibit lack of adaptability (LOA), which is the inability to complete the course
       because of physical, psychological, or personality factors. LOA eliminees require an
       evaluation from both medical and rated personnel. This category includes airsickness and
       manifestation of apprehension (MOA). Specific deficiencies are annotated on AF IMT
       174, Record of Individual Counseling, or AETC Form 173, Student Record of
       Academic/Nonacademic Counseling and Comments.
       3.3.1.2. Fail to demonstrate the potential to complete the course within syllabus
       constraints.
       3.3.1.3. Receive punitive action under the articles of the UCMJ.
   3.3.2. Students are eliminated if they:
       3.3.2.1. Become medically disqualified, unless a flight surgeon (FS) determines the
       disqualification may resolve within 12 months of the initial disqualification. In the latter
       instance, place the student in medical hold status. Note: Individuals placed on DNIF
       status for more than 30 days are placed either in medical hold status or considered for
       medical disqualification. In general, medical conditions expected to resolve within 12
       months and assessed as likely to permit the individual to return to flying duties should
       result in a determination to place the individual on medical hold (paragraph 4.4). All
       other medical disqualifications should result in medical elimination and reassignment or
       processing for separation. Refer to AFI 48-101, Aerospace Medicine Operations, and AFI
       48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards, for additional guidance.
       3.3.2.2. Initiate action to separate from the service.
       3.3.2.3. Are involved in drug or alcohol abuse substantiated by reliable evidence.
       3.3.2.4. Are adjudicated absent without leave, are confined, or have deserted.
       3.3.2.5. Demonstrate improper conduct, attitude, or lack of responsibility toward
       assigned duties or obligations. This may include character disorders that raise doubt
       about the student’s fitness for continued service.
   3.3.3. Students are disenrolled if they:
AETCI36-2205V6_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 25 SEPTEMBER 2012                                               17


       3.3.3.1. Are recalled by the parent unit or higher headquarters. Note: Units will not allow
       students to be recalled without prior coordination with 19 AF/DOG.
       3.3.3.2. Are hospitalized for an extended period (as determined by the OG/CC). Student
       may be considered for reinstatement at a later date.
       3.3.3.3. Have not met course entry prerequisites or have not received an approved entry
       waiver.
       3.3.3.4. Experience difficulties in an instructor upgrade course where the problem
       specifically concerns the student’s lack of instructional ability rather than a lack of
       proficiency.
3.4. In-Flight G-Tolerance Problems:
   3.4.1. G-Tolerance. For students experiencing G-tolerance difficulties, supervisors should
   refer to AFI 11-404, Centrifuge Training for High-G Aircrew and AETCI 11-406. In addition
   to the options found in AFI 11-404, SQ/CCs may direct G-tolerance evaluation and training.
   Any time a student experiences a G-tolerance incident or improperly executes an anti-G
   straining maneuver (AGSM) that degrades mission accomplishment, the SQ/CC must
   determine the student’s potential to fly sustained high-G aircraft as well as the proper course
   of action and potential corrective actions. Possible corrective actions include, but are not
   limited to, diet, nutrition, exercise, personal, and mission imposed stress academics, AGSM
   training, strength testing, tailored workout program, in-flight training, return to the
   centrifuge, etc. Any additional training will be conducted in accordance with the syllabus.
   3.4.2. AGSM Proficiency:
       3.4.2.1. During any sortie, if the IP determines a physiological incident involving AGSM
       has occurred, the mission will be terminated and all mission tapes saved. An OG-
       designated pilot, flight surgeon, aerospace physiologist will review the tapes and make
       recommendations for corrective actions to the SQ/CC.
       3.4.2.2. If a student experiences a G-tolerance problem prior to demonstrating
       proficiency in AGSM, the SQ/CC may authorize corrective action listed in paragraph
       3.4.1. If an aircraft sortie is authorized, designate it according to the syllabus and local
       guidance.
       3.4.2.3. After AGSM proficiency is attained, if a student self-identifies a G-tolerance
       problem or receives a grade of ―1‖ on AGSM, the student may receive corrective action
       training without receiving an NE/SNP for the sortie. Example: Student ―grays‖ out on
       BFM-3 during the third setup and calls ―knock it off‖ for Gs; the mission may be graded
       noneffective/other (NE/OTH). Following corrective actions (listed in paragraph 3.4.1),
       BFM-3 will be reaccomplished. Subsequent regressions will result in an NE/SNP
       followed by corrective action and an X-ride.
   3.4.3. Chronic G-Tolerance Issues. If a student experiences chronic G-related problems
   after corrective actions are accomplished, enter the student in the CR process, and consider
   the student for elimination with aerospace physiologist concurrence.
3.5. Medical Management. Operations and medical personnel must ensure SQ/CCs are
informed when students exhibit medical conditions that affect student decisions. Supervisors
must also strive to keep students motivated and flying on a regular basis.

                                  STUDENT GRADE BOOKS

4.1. Introduction. Student grade books are for the exclusive use of the student’s FLT/CC,
supervisors, and immediate chain of command. Additional procedures are specified in local unit
guidance.
   4.1.1. Secure grade books (both paper and electronic) and personal information folders to
   prevent unauthorized access. Information affecting student training that is inappropriate for
   public access or sensitive in nature is documented in this folder. The contractor approved for
   conducting formal training or maintaining training records may keep grade books in a secure
   location. When required, FLT/CCs/supervisors maintain personal information folders on
   students to protect information of a personal nature not appropriate for the grade book.
   Students may only access their own grade book.
   4.1.2. Record each aircraft, academic, and ground training event in the grade book.
4.2. Content. GTMS, GTIMS, TIMS, or TMS dictate the forms to be used in each grade book.
If electronic grade books are not used, the following items will be included in the grade book, as
applicable:
   4.2.1. Grade Book Discrepancy Log/Record of Grade Book review (locally produced).
   4.2.2. AETC Form 903 or AETC Form 903P, Unaccomplished Task/Milestone Regression
   Log.
   4.2.3. AETC Form 902, Student Activity Record.
   4.2.4. AETC Form 900, Individual Mission Gradesheet.
   4.2.5. Fighter Aircrew Conditioning Program Log (if required by syllabus or local OI).
   4.2.6. AF IMT 174 or AETC Form 173.
   4.2.7. Messages (ANG and HQ AFRC, if applicable).
   4.2.8. Student officer’s biography.
   4.2.9. Additional forms required for weapons qualification or other requirements determined
   locally (i.e., solo clearance logs, CTS requirement logs, etc.).
   4.2.10. AETC Form 6.
4.3. Documentation. Grade sheets are used to document student training in the grade book.
Instructors provide grades to applicable mission tasks, a concise summary of the student’s
training, and ensure entries clarify any training action. In addition, documentation is required for
the following:
   4.3.1. G-tolerance incident, airsickness, or MOA episodes.
   4.3.2. Unusual occurrences that could affect the student’s progress.
   4.3.3. Syllabus deviations.
   4.3.4. Additional training authorization (―X‖ sortie/simulator).

   4.3.5. Grade book review prior to a PC. Document any training anomalies, deviations, etc.
   4.3.6. Removal from or reinstatement into training.
   4.3.7. Syllabus prerequisite waivers or syllabus waivers.
   4.3.8. Failure of any academic test, flight evaluation, or PC.
   4.3.9. Counseling sessions. Note: Document sessions concerning sensitive personal
   problems on AF IMT 174 or AETC Form 173. These forms should be kept in personal
   information folders maintained by the supervisor. Electronic mail messages are not suitable
   documentation for counseling sessions.
   4.3.10. Administrative hold.
   4.3.11. Assignment to and removal from CAP.
   4.3.11. (COLUMBUSAFB) Document placement on CAP using CAP letter templates in
   Attachments 1 – 3 to this supplement. Place this letter on the front cover of the student grade
   book. Document CAP placement and removal from CAP in the grade book on AF Form
   4293, Student Activity Record.
4.4. Disposition of Student Training Records:
   4.4.1. Unit registrars maintain student training records according to the RDS. Include all
   grade sheets, student activity records, and additional grade book forms and logs. Units will
   make a copy of the training records to include AETC Forms 904, 1122, TIMS Training
   Jacket or IFF grade book and forward all records to the student’s gaining unit or follow-on
   training unit within 5 duty days of class graduation. For students with follow-on training at
   the same base, records will be forwarded after graduation from the last course attended.
   Forward all AETC Forms 904, Training Summary, to 19 AF/DOG.
   4.4.2. Units will maintain pipeline student training reports from previous formal training
   programs.
