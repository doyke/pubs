                                             Chapter 1

                      AFMC CONTINUITY POLICY AND GUIDANCE

1.1. Air Force Policy.
     1.1.1. DoDD 3020.26, Defense Continuity Program, defines Continuity of Operations as a
     program that assures essential functions can be performed following any natural or man-
     made disaster including pandemics and/or technological attacks. It is Air Force policy to
     maintain a comprehensive and effective continuity capability to preserve Air Force functions,
     missions, and capabilities that support DoD Mission Essential Functions (MEFs).
     1.1.2. Within AFMC a natural or man-made disaster--or a pandemic--is a more likely COOP
     execution trigger than a terrorist attack. However the cause is immaterial. The result is still
     the same: loss of essential facilities or personnel required to continue MEFs. All AFMC
     organizations will plan, budget (if required) and be prepared to execute MEFs to support Air
     Force and DoD MEF execution, to project forces supporting Combatant Commanders
     (CCDRs), and when requested through the Secretary of Defense (SecDef), support civil and
     humanitarian requests.
     1.1.3. Incorporate continuity requirements, practices, and exercises into daily operations so
     as to have seamless essential function continuity during and after any emergency. Address
     an all-hazards approach, but emphasize events which will most likely degrade operations.
     1.1.4. Air Force military, civilians, and contractors with continuity responsibilities should
     know what actions to take in a with and without warning emergency.
     1.1.5. Continuity enables operational capability and focuses on maintaining mission
     capability and component mission essential functions.
        1.1.5.1. Continuity is one of several programs that enable operational capability to
        continue with limited or no impact on mission execution when an event occur. Success
        in meeting objectives requires risk management application and accepting risk at the
        appropriate level. A careful balance between risk mitigation through effective integration
        with the Critical Asset Risk Management (CARM) program, Counterterrorism, Anti-
        terrorism (AT), Force Protection (FP), Information Assurance (IA), physical risks in the
        emergency management (EM) programs and other mission continuation programs will
        guide each command organization to develop its best solution.
        1.1.5.2. Use risk management methodologies that focus on mission continuity
        capabilities to identify and develop mitigation solutions. Use the resulting data to
        prioritize and justify budget resource allocation.
1.2. AFMC Policy. HQ AFMC and all major subordinate organizations must develop a COOP
plan. Within AFMC, “major subordinate organizations” are defined as Centers. IAW AFI 10-
208, COOP planning in AFMC is resident at its Centers. Note that COOP plans are “facility-
centric.” Centers must develop and maintain a comprehensive COOP program that contains
continuity plans for the Center headquarters and each subordinate organization that has identified
mission essential functions. Center COOP plans may be configured in the format that best suits
the Center’s organizational structure. Within the Center, subordinate organizations will develop
plans which detail their MEFs and the necessary staff, equipment and means to carry them out
AFMCI10-208 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 5


IAW Center Continuity Plans Officer (CPO) guidance. Take special care to emphasize mission
continuity. As such, co-located and/or co-dependent organizations (those supporting each
other’s MEFs) require complementary COOP plans, even if they fall under different Center’s
control. Consider merged plans if it makes operational sense (see 3.2.11. below). Air Base
Wing Continuity Plans should not duplicate existing plans (see 3.2.11.4. below).
   1.2.1. AFMC’s continuity of operations is designed to support the Air Force’s warfighting
   capability after a disaster or, for designated functions, while under attack. Those program
   elements necessary to maintain continuity and enhance decision-making include:
       1.2.1.1. Command and control, by organizing appropriate personnel, communications,
       computers, and information.
       1.2.1.2. Senior leader involvement across all command levels.
       1.2.1.3. Integrating COOP into AFMC training and exercise programs at all levels.
1.3. Continuity Preparedness Objectives. Continuity is a primary operational capability
enabler and focuses on MEFs that support command customers at all levels and under all
conditions, including other Air Force MAJCOMs, Combatant Commanders and by Secretary of
Defense request, civil, and humanitarian support requests. Emphasize planning for the events
which are most likely to occur and degrade operations at your Center and its subordinate
organizations. Focus COOP planning on mission continuity and the degree of interruption which
can be tolerated. Prioritize COOP actions in organizational contingency and crisis planning.
   1.3.1. All AFMC organizations identify those tasks which enable MEFs and maintain an
   appropriate capability level over the time continuum.
       1.3.1.1. Structure the organization’s daily operations to allow seamless and timely
       essential function continuation during and after any emergency.
       1.3.1.2. Have a predetermined order of succession and/or delegation of authority if a
       disruption occurs that renders leadership unavailable or incapable of performing their
       responsibilities.
   1.3.1.3. All AFMC organizations must have COOP plans reflecting an acceptable level of
   mission resumption and/or reconstitution time, followed by a seamless return to normal
   operations when the continuity event ends.

                               COOP PROGRAM GUIDANCE

3.1. AFMC COOP Program Responsibilities.
   3.1.1. At a minimum, AFMC COOP programs at HQ, Centers and their subordinate
   organizations will include the following elements:
       3.1.1.1. Program guidance, both generalized and organizationally specific.
       3.1.1.2. Plans and Procedures. Includes MEFs, delegation of authority, orders of
       succession, relocation/reconstitution (if required) locations, teleworking (if applicable),
       interoperable communications, vital records, databases and human capital.
       3.1.1.3. Tests, training and exercises to assess and validate plans, policies and procedures
       for
          3.1.1.3.1. Alerting and notifying COOP–tasked personnel and if necessary,
          transportation.
          3.1.1.3.2. Validating identified MEFs for currency.
          3.1.1.3.3. Data redundancy,        availability   of     computer    applications     and
          communications.
          3.1.1.3.4. Personnel readiness for        teleworking,    relocation/reconstitution   and
          performing prescribed functions.
              3.1.1.3.4.1. Designated Reconstitution Team (RT) members must have this
              information included in their position description (PD). AFI 36-507, Mobilization
              of the Civilian Work Force, addresses both Emergency Essential (E-E) Positions
              and Employees (Attachment 4) and Key Positions and Employees (Attachment 5)
              responsibilities and processes. Personnel who are considered E-E, or Alternate E-
              E, or otherwise designated to perform E-E duties must sign a DD Form 2635,
              each E-E position description must contain a statement designating the position E-
              E, and the position must contain the correct information in the actual position
              build in DCPDS.
              3.1.1.3.4.2. Emergency Relocation Staff (ERS) duties are not required to be
              included in an individual’s PD.
          3.1.1.3.5. Validating other equipment necessary to perform essential functions.
          3.1.1.3.6. Resolving issues through an active after-action program.
          3.1.1.3.7. Logistics (including any COOP associated facilities).
3.2. Writing COOP Plans. COOP plans should be executable with and without warning,
during and after duty hours. When writing your COOP plan use planning factors contained in
AFI 10-208, this instruction, the documents in Section 3.2.1 below and host installation plans
based on them.
   3.2.1. COOP plans should complement and comply with guidance in the following
   documents:
10                                                      AFMCI10-208 16 OCTOBER 2013


     3.2.1.1. AFPD 10-24, Air Force Critical Asset Risk Management (CARM) Program–
     critical assets and MEFs should be complementary.
     3.2.1.2. AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting–comply with reporting requirements upon
     COOP activation and movement to relocation/ reconstitution sites.
     3.2.1.3. AFI 10-245, Antiterrorism (AT)
     3.2.1.4. AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations and Planning Execution–comply with
     reporting requirements.
     3.2.1.5. AFI 10-701, Operations Security (OPSEC)–comply with security requirements.
     Develop OPSEC standards based on MEF priority.
     3.2.1.6. AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and
     Operations (which incorporates Installation Emergency Management Plan (IEMP) 10-2)
     plan for MEF continuation during or following a major accident, natural disaster,
     conventional attack (including high-yield explosives) or Chemical, Biological,
     Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) incident.
     3.2.1.7. AFI 10-2604, Disease Containment Planning Guidance-plan for MEF
     continuation during a pandemic or other contagious biological event or outbreak.
     3.2.1.8. AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense (formerly Installation Security)
     3.2.1.9. War Mobilization Plan I (WMP-1) – contains additional factors to assist with
     planning efforts.
     3.2.1.10. HAF HOI 36-16, Telework - incorporate telework guidance/procedures and
     routing practice into COOP.
 3.2.2. Use the COOP format plan that best meets your organization’s needs and achieves
 planning goals. Include sufficient detail to provide clear guidance during the stresses of a
 disaster, but flexible enough to be adaptable to the unforeseen. Centers may choose to have
 separate plans for the Center HQ and each subordinate organization, or a single COOP plan
 for the entire Center, with attachments for the HQ and each subordinate organization, unless
 an organization’s COOP is identified as CLASSIFIED, in which case it must be separate. If
 the Center headquarters is co-located with a subordinate organization, those plans may be
 combined at the Center Commander’s option. Suggested plan formats:
     3.2.2.1. Chapter/subchapter (as used in the HQ COOP plan) with subordinate
     Complex/Directorate/Wing Continuity Plans as attachments.
     3.2.2.2. OPlan format (see War & Mobilization Plan, Vol 1 (WMP-1), Basic Planning
     and AFMAN 10-401, Volume 2, Planning Formats and Guidance.)
     3.2.2.3. Combine with Survival, Recovery, and Reconstitution (SRR) plans. Such a plan
     would be titled "COOP/SRR- (organization designation)." Note: COOP Plans should
     not be combined with other plans such as the IEMP, Integrated Defense Plan (IDP), Anti-
     Terrorism (AT) Plans and Installation Force Protection plans. In AFMC, COOP plans
     are Center-based, while IEMPs and IDPs are installation level plans. Combining will
     cause unnecessary problems.
AFMCI10-208 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                      11


  3.2.3. The first step in COOP plan preparation is to identify and prioritize your
  organization’s MEFs. Identify MEFs at the complex/wing/directorate level, as specific
  guidance to continue these MEFs will be detailed in these plans. The appropriate
  commander/director determines and prioritizes MEFs. In organizations where MEF
  priorities are constantly changing due to shifting workloads and tasks, prioritize MEFs by
  general category (e.g., “continue engine overhaul line”) versus specific but transitory tasks
  (“solve turbine blade fracturing problem in F-100 engine”). Consider MEFs that support
  other organizations when prioritizing. Organizations with Task Critical Assets under the
  CARM program should have corresponding MEFs. Warning: associating MEFs with
  Critical Assets will require the MEF list to be classified SECRET at minimum, this will
  hinder general access during execution of the COOP. When supportable MEFs are approved,
  the next step is to determine the resources--facilities, equipment, and personnel--necessary to
  execute each MEF. Attachments 3 and 4 in AFI 10-208 provide guidance for this process.
  3.2.4. Relocation and Reconstitution: HQ AFMC, Center, and all Center subordinate unit
  plans will address relocation. Choose relocation sites within commuting distance (on or off-
  base) for localized disasters; choose the reconstitution site (if required) outside the local area
  that is considered vulnerable to man-made or natural area-wide disasters. Only the HQ
  AFMC plan must have a reconstitution section; for all others it’s at the center commander’s
  option. The decision to include a reconstitution section should consider whether there are
  threats that could affect the entire base/region, thus requiring deployment to a distant site.
  The Center Commander may require reconstitution plans for some, all or no Center
  subordinate organizations depending on their geographical location and threat.
     3.2.4.1. Centers, their subordinate organizations and HQ AFMC should have at least one
     predetermined local relocation site so as to continue their MEFs with minimum delay or
     disruption.
         3.2.4.1.1. If possible the relocation site should be sufficiently separated from the
         normal work site so as not to be affected by the same incident and not be served by
         infrastructure that could be simultaneously affected.
         3.2.4.1.2. Take maximum advantage of existing compatible facilities, including co-
         location and/or “hot bunking” arrangements with other organizations, either on-base
         or at another nearby military installation.
         3.2.4.1.3. Be prepared to designate/occupy an ad hoc site if the predetermined site is
         unusable.
         3.2.4.1.4. If predetermining a relocation site isn’t feasible for industrial operations,
         have a process in place to quickly determine a suitable ad hoc location.
     3.2.4.2. Detail essential command, control and communication systems availability at
     relocation and (if required) reconstitution sites.  List any required emergency
     communications nodes. Describe communications procedures to be used during a COOP
     event. Maintain all necessary files, documents, computer software and databases
     required to execute COOP plans for immediate Emergency Relocation Staff (ERS) use.
     For example:
         3.2.4.2.1. Make military-specific equipment such as common access card (CAC)
         readers, handheld communication devices, laptop computers and Home Use Programs
12                                                      AFMCI10-208 16 OCTOBER 2013


        (HUPs) available to military, civilians and contractors to perform telework as
        required.
        3.2.4.2.2. Establish procedures  to   distribute   Government   Emergency
        Telecommunications      Service     (GETS)       cards     as      required.
        (http://www.dhs.gov/government-emergency-telecommunications-service-gets)
        3.2.4.2.3. Establish procedures for accessing documents/records that are critical to
        MEF performance. This can include fly-away kits, pre-positioning at relocation or
        reconstitution sites, and/or establishing web or SharePoint sites. Any data with
        personal information must comply with applicable privacy laws and regulations.
     3.2.4.3. Administrative relocation facilities must be operational no later than 12 hours
     after activation, but organizations may specify more stringent guidelines in their plans.
     Industrial, lab and test facilities must be operational as quickly as possible so as to
     minimally affect organizational MEFs. Organizations must be able to sustain operations
     at their relocation or reconstitution site for up to 60 days.
     3.2.4.4. Consider incorporating telework in your plan where feasible. Alternate site size
     restrictions could limit the number of workers, and a pandemic or other medical
     emergency could restrict or eliminate gatherings.
     3.2.4.5. Identify critical requirements and procurement needs. Develop logistics plans to
     sustain operations at the relocation and (if applicable) the reconstitution site.
     3.2.4.6. Coordinate with the host Air Base Wing all support requirements that they
     would be tasked to provide IAW host-tenant agreements.
        3.2.4.6.1. Develop transportation plans for moving personnel to relocation sites and
        sustaining operations, if required.
     3.2.4.7. Organizations at all levels opting for a reconstitution section in their COOP
     plan(s) will:
        3.2.4.7.1. Coordinate with another base or other suitable location to serve as a
        reconstitution site.
        3.2.4.7.2. Negotiate a MOA with the receiving base/location that outline
        requirements and responsibilities for both organizations.
        3.2.4.7.3. Include plans/procedures for reconstitution team departure notification,
        assembly and transportation to the reconstitution site.
     3.2.4.8. HQ AFMC will pre-designate another AFMC organization as a reconstitution
     site. Until the reconstitution site is capable of supporting operations, virtual Command,
     Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance
     (C4ISR) may be implemented. If the planned reconstitution site is unusable, the
     AFMC/CC will designate another AFMC base as an ad hoc reconstitution site.
        3.2.4.8.1. An MOA between HQ AFMC and the reconstitution site’s Commander
        outlines requirements and responsibilities for both organizations.
        3.2.4.8.2. The reconstitution site’s Air Base Wing will prepare a reception plan for
        the HQ RT.
AFMCI10-208 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                    13


  3.2.5. Applicable Emergency Action Procedures (EAP), Force Protection Conditions
  (FPCONs) and/or disease containment plans will direct crisis action teams (CATs) to
  recommend COOP implementation. Describe the procedures for advisories, alerts and
  COOP plan execution. In a pandemic situation, wing/group commanders/directors, in
  consultation with the Public Health Emergency Officer (PHEO), may implement appropriate
  COOP actions for their wing/group/directorate if the organization’s MEF accomplishment is
  threatened by pandemic-caused absenteeism or required social distancing.           Once
  implemented, the CAT (in consultation with unit Emergency Relocation Staffs (ERS)), will
  prioritize installation resources based on MEF criticality.
  3.2.6. Describe organizational structure, command succession and delegation of authority to
  appropriate staff.
     3.2.6.1. Document order of succession and/or delegation of authority for leadership
     positions in COOP plans if a disruption renders leadership unavailable or unable to
     perform their duties.
         3.2.6.1.1. HQ AFMC and Center plans will document leadership succession and
         delegation with sufficient breadth, depth and geographic dispersal following a COOP
         event.
         3.2.6.1.2. HQ AFMC and Center wing and directorate Continuity Plans will also
         document leadership succession and delegation where feasible.
         3.2.6.1.3. Preemptive reconstitution team deployment should include leadership
         successor members.
  3.2.7. Identify any higher headquarters reporting requirements.         Refer to AFI 10-206,
  Operational Reporting.
  3.2.8. Describe possible shortfalls and limiting factors.
  3.2.9. Include contact information, such as telephone numbers of alternate facilities and ERS
  notification methods and procedures.
  3.2.10. Establish training requirements and procedures to identify and/or train qualified
  personnel to fill COOP positions critical to maintaining command and control during
  emergencies, including the ERS and the RT.
  3.2.11. EPCs in each Center’s subordinate organization must prepare a Continuity Plan that
  prioritizes and details their MEFs (see 3.2.3. above for prioritization guidance), the personnel
  and equipment required to perform them. These plans must:
     3.2.11.1. Contain organization-specific details that complement their overall plan. List
     mission essential documents and equipment workloads with associated information
     accessibility options or location. Make pertinent vital records, mission documents and
     equipment listings readily available so equipment can be processed for transportation to
     the relocation and/or alternate site. Establish personnel manning requirements and
     procedures so that enough qualified personnel are available throughout the duration of the
     emergency.
     3.2.11.2. Take into account multiple facilities occupied by a single organization.
     3.2.11.3. Be attachments to the appropriate (co-located/parent) Center plan.
14                                                       AFMCI10-208 16 OCTOBER 2013


     3.2.11.4. ABW/TW/G may meet the Continuity Plan requirement with existing
     emergency operations plans at the commanders’ option.
     3.2.11.5. Identify military, civilian and contractor positions with COOP responsibilities
     under normal and emergency procedures. Ensure position descriptions and contract
     statements of work clearly reflect COOP requirements.
         3.2.11.5.1. Establish alert and notification procedures for COOP-tasked personnel.
         Have recall procedures available to augment them with additional personnel.
         3.2.11.5.2. Develop personnel accountability procedures for all personnel.
         3.2.11.5.3. Incorporate pandemic mitigation/containment guidelines as prescribed in
         the Disease Containment Plan (DCP) in COOP plans.
         3.2.11.5.4. Comply with reporting requirements outlined in AFI 10-205, Availability
         of Major Command Commanders.
     3.2.11.6. Continuity plans will be reviewed at least annually and updated whenever there
     is a change in MEFs and/or resource requirements--facilities, equipment or personnel.
     3.2.11.7. List the ERS composition identified by position, AF Speciality Code (military)
     or position/Skill Code and/or Position Description/Core Document (civilian) and office
     symbol. Link each position to one or more MEFs. Indicate any specific equipment, data
     or special skills required to perform the MEFs. See paragraph 4.7. for additional Center-
     level Continuity Plan content suggestions; use as applicable.
  3.2.12. In addition to paragraphs 3.2.1.- 11. above, Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC)
  and its subordinate Air Logistics Complexes (ALCs)/Wings will:
     3.2.12.1. Develop COOP/continuity plans for each complex. Note: if HQ AFTC and
     OC-ALC occupy the same facility, Center and OC-ALC plans can be combined at Center
     Commander’s option.
     3.2.12.2. Identify alternate facilities for both aircraft and component repair, utilizing
     compatible DOD and/or contractor facilities. Each ALC will be prepared to estimate
     what percentage of their original capacity can be achieved at these alternate sites, after
     what lead time and for how long.
     3.2.12.3. As part of the planning process, identify mission essential functions for each
     Complex by workload that can or cannot be performed at the customer’s site, another
     Complex or at a contract facility. Have personnel and equipment details readily available
     for planning purposes and develop a procedure to quickly match surviving work sites
     with industrial workloads that support center MEFs.
     3.2.12.4. Indicate how the work force would be utilized for operations at either nearby or
     distant sites.
     3.2.12.5. Identify methods of receiving and shipping depot input and output at alternate
     sites and communicating this information to customers.
     3.2.12.6. Identify procedures for salvaging, inventorying and transporting any remaining/
     surviving equipment, parts, tooling etc. to the alternate site(s).
AFMCI10-208 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                       15


      3.2.12.7. As part of the plan, consider transferring organic workloads to contractors if the
      relocation site(s) cannot support these operations. Include a transfer timeline.
      3.2.12.8. Prepare plans for security at relocation sites.
      3.2.12.9. In addition to paragraphs 3.2.1.- 11. above, the Aerospace Maintenance and
      Regeneration Group (AMARG) COOP/continuity plan will:
          3.2.12.9.1. Be able to identify, inventory and provide security for surviving assets.
          3.2.12.9.2. Indicate how the work force would be utilized to salvage remaining
          assets.
          3.2.12.9.3. Be prepared to communicate to customers the center’s ability to and
          methods of shipping aircraft and/or parts.
   3.2.13. In addition to paragraphs 3.2.1.- 11. above, AFTC, AFRL and AFNWC and their
   subordinate organizations as applicable will:
      3.2.13.1. Identify alternate sites to perform essential research, development, test and
      evaluation (RDT&E) utilizing compatible public and/or private facilities as part of the
      planning process. Indicate functions achievable at these alternate sites, required lead time
      and duration. Identify those facilities which are unique and whose functions cannot be
      duplicated elsewhere and any possible workarounds.
      3.2.13.2. Identify essential RDT&E functions with approximate square footage,
      personnel and equipment required for each.
      3.2.13.3. Indicate how the work force would be utilized for continued operations at either
      nearby or distant sites.
      3.2.13.4. Reference how any remaining/surviving equipment, prototypes, tooling etc.
      would be salvaged, inventoried and transported to the alternate site(s).
      3.2.13.5. As part of the plan, consider transferring organic taskings to contractors if the
      relocation site cannot support these operations. Include a transfer timeline.
      3.2.13.6. Prepare plans for security at relocation sites.
   3.2.14. In addition to paragraphs 3.2.1.- 11. above, AFLCMC will develop the single center
   level COOP.
      3.2.14.1. Center subordinate organizations will develop a continuity plan for attachment
      to the AFLCMC center level COOP. Center subordinate organization continuity plans
      will include Wing/PEO/Directorate personnel colocated with the Center Headquarters
      and/or another installation.
      3.2.14.2. AFLCMC subordinate organization will negotiate a relocation MOA with their
      relocation partner that outlines the requirements and responsibilities for both
      organizations.
   3.2.15. Each center will provide HQ AFMC/A3X with an electronic copy of their COOP
   plans.
3.3. COOP Plan execution. Take the following actions if an emergency might or does require
COOP execution.
16                                                        AFMCI10-208 16 OCTOBER 2013


  3.3.1. Be prepared to activate relocation site(s) (and reconstitution site if applicable) in a
  with or without warning situation, during or after duty hours consistent with your pre-
  planned “trigger” event(s), including FPCONs, advance weather warnings, etc.
  3.3.2. If some or all the organization's facilities become unusable, the relocation site(s)
  should immediately assume those responsibilities in a with-warning situation, or as quickly
  as possible in a no-warning situation. Report this to HQ AFMC Command Center, the Air
  Force Service Watch Cell or, if activated, the Air Force Emergency Operations Center IAW
  AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting.
 3.3.3. If the potential trigger event is a pandemic, execution may be in phases, by action
 and/or by subordinate organizations within a center or the HQ. Since a pandemic may affect
 an organization at different rates and/or time, wing commanders/directors may initiate
 pandemic COOP actions unilaterally (in consultation with the PHEO) if pandemic-related
 absences are affecting MEF accomplishment.
  3.3.4. If your facility is designated as an AFMC Headquarters reconstitution site, monitor the
  HQ status and be prepared to assume your reception/support responsibilities (See 3.2.4.8.
  above).
  3.3.5. COOP execution phases:
     3.3.5.1. Readiness and Preparedness/Normal Operations Phase. During normal daily
     operations, COOP readiness should ensure identifying and protecting successors/military
     authority, personnel accountability and relocation site readiness. A COOP event may be
     a no-notice disaster or a with-warning event, such as an approaching hurricane or a
     pandemic. If the Commander’s CAT exercises the Installation Commander’s authority to
     determine it is appropriate to send personnel home, make every effort to preemptively
     send non-essential personnel home and/or implement critical mission
     relocation/reconstitution. Apply risk mitigation methodologies during the Readiness and
     Preparedness/Normal Operations Phase to mitigate risk to MEF execution. Refer to AFI
     10-208, Attachment 5 for further guidance.
     3.3.5.2. Activation and Relocation/Reconstitution Phase (0-12 hours). Concentrate
     initial efforts on successor survival, devolution of command, relocating key personnel,
     reestablishing command and control, and operational/communication capabilities at your
     predesignated relocation or reconstitution site. During this phase, give priority to military
     operations (including logistical support), continuing C4ISR functions, transferring
     personnel and computer data/applications necessary to support operations, personnel
     accountability and damage and residual resource assessment and reporting.
     3.3.5.3. Alternate Operating Facility Operation Phase. Commences with full MEF
     execution focusing on military operations, communications, transportation, performing
     other essential functions, resource recovery, and salvaging assets. Affected organizations
     should notify C2 agencies of manpower and capability at alternate locations. AFI 10-
     206, Operational Reporting, has reporting requirements. Address restoring command
     staffs, capabilities, and functions as resources and operational tasks permit.
     3.3.5.4. Return to Normal Operations Phase. Begin implementing plans to resume
     normal operations with an orderly return to the established operating facilities or
AFMCI10-208 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                     17


       movement to a temporary or permanent facility. Maintain communication with C2
       agencies during transition and continue reporting mission manpower and capability.
3.4. Classifying COOP Plans. Classify COOP plans according to content, as required by
applicable overarching program security guidance, MEFs, mission criticality, capabilities, key
personnel movement, compilation of data revealing additional associations or relationships and
the specific plan(s) supported. COOP plans will not be marked lower than For Official Use Only
(FOUO).
   3.4.1. Use DoD Defense Continuity Program (DCP) Security Classification Guide (15 Dec
   05 with 8-06 amendments) for details and to determine specific classification decisions when
   no original classification authority (OCA) or ambiguity exists.
   3.4.2. Refer to the Continuity of Operations (COOP)/Continuity of Government (COG)
   Community of Practice for the Defense Continuity Security Classification Guidance
   (NIPRNet and SIPRNet).
   3.4.3. Plans in their entirety are normally classified CONFIDENTIAL or SECRET, based on
   the organization’s mission criticality assessment from a COOP and CARM perspective. All
   COOP-related information is sensitive; exercise extreme caution when compiling
   information in a COOP plan. Individual unclassified items when grouped together may
   reveal information that is classified when considered as a whole. Deconflict guidance from
   this instruction with security guides from related programs; defer to the highest classification
   mandated. When determining a plan’s classification consider:
       3.4.3.1. Mission sensitivity.
       3.4.3.2. The most likely event which might trigger its execution.
       3.4.3.3. MEFs that support a CCDR’s operation as part of the planning process and
       subsequent execution timelines when determining overall COOP plan classification.
       MEFs identified in the plan as Critical Assets will require the MEF list to be classified
       SECRET at minimum.
       3.4.3.4. Subsections which would be executed following a natural disaster may not
       require the same classification as those used in the aftermath of a terrorist or enemy
       attack, assuming they do not reveal other aspects of the COOP plan. Direct classification
       questions to HQ AFMC/A3X.
   3.4.4. DOD policy governing/requiring continuity plans, the plans’ existence and acronyms
   associated with continuity plans/planning are normally For Official Use Only (FOUO).
   3.4.5. Specific procedural details are classified up to SECRET depending on the most likely
   causative factor for COOP execution. See 3.4.9.3. below for guidance on reconstitution
   plans.
   3.4.6. Exercise, test and/or training material that does not reveal specific COOP-related
   objectives, plan deficiencies or segments being tested/exercised are FOUO at minimum.

Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Branches of Government assuring the capability exists
to continue uninterrupted essential component functions across a wide range of potential
emergencies, including localized acts of nature, accidents, and technological and/or
attack—related emergencies. COOP involves plans and capabilities covering the same
functional objectives of Continuity of Government, must be maintained at a high level of
readiness, and be capable of implementation both with and without warning. COOP is not only
