SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include: the requirement that maintenance units will use TAS/TCMAX for accountability.
Specified the requirement for items checked out for more than 24 hours. Removed the
requirement to retain the two most current CTK inventories.
1. General Responsibilities.
     1.1. All squadrons assigned or attached to TAFB who require the use of tools, equipment or
     personal equipment (i.e., ear protectors, reflective belts, headsets, etc.) which can make their
     way into any aircraft maintenance area, or have occasion to traverse the flight line to include
     being loaded as cargo onto an aircraft must have procedures in place to account for them.
     Procedures must be detailed enough that if lost tools, equipment, or personal equipment are
     found they can be returned to the owning squadron. This includes any organization/squadron
     that dispatches to aircraft parking/runway/taxi areas and Maintenance Group (MXG)
     maintenance areas. NOTE: Aircraft maintenance area is defined as any area where
     maintenance on aircraft, aircraft parts, or equipment takes place, or anywhere on the flight
     line to include any tools loaded onto or used on equipment that may be loaded onto an
     aircraft.
     1.2. Squadron commanders with personnel who use tools, equipment, or personal protective
     equipment in an aircraft maintenance area will ensure all assigned personnel are familiar with
     lost tool procedures and the tool control program for all tools and equipment used on the
     flight line or in aircraft maintenance areas.
2. User Responsibilities.
     2.1. Users will inspect all tools and equipment for serviceability prior to use. They will
     never use unserviceable tools (i.e., damaged fan stoppers, fan sticks, screwdrivers, hammers,
     or torque wrenches.) Users will ensure all identified discrepancies with tools/equipment are
     documented on the item’s applicable form. Users will only use tools and equipment for their
     intended purpose. Users will never use personal tools not controlled through Tool
     Accountability System (TAS/TCMAX) and will not take them on the flight line or in any
     maintenance area.
3. Marking/Security.
     3.1. Toolboxes, cabinets, roll-aways, or special purpose kits must be available, properly
     identified, and secured.
     3.2. Composite Tool Kits (CTKs) will be numbered with identification designators listed in
     Attachment 4. Tools located inside the tool box may be marked IAW AFI 21-101. Use
     labels on containers to store tools or equipment where etching is impractical. The tools or
     equipment in the container do not have to be marked but each item’s size, and quantity must
     be indicated on the container and on the Master Inventory List (MIL) (i.e., 2 each hi-torque
     #10 apexes, 3 each #30 drill bits).
     3.3. Dispatched and mobility toolboxes will have reflective tape on their sides and ends.
TRAVISAFBI21-107 26 MARCH 2013                                                                  3


4. Tool Accountability and Control.
   4.1. All maintenance units will use TAS/TCMAX as a primary means for accountability and
   to track and control the location of tools and equipment stored and issued. AF Form 1297,
   Temporary Issue Receipt, may be used in addition to TAS/TCMAX, for increased
   accountability or as a TAS/TCMAX backup.
      4.1.1. Aircrew Flight Equipment sections are not required to use TAS for accountability.
   4.2. The owning work center will account for all CTKs, equipment, and individually issued
   tools at the end of each shift.
   4.3. Individuals involved with job site transfer of tools or equipment will conduct a joint
   inventory and document the transfer on AF Form 1297. After inventory is complete, hand-
   carry AF Form 1297 to the tool room and give it to the CTK custodian. Tools and support
   equipment will not be kept out longer than 24 hours unless required for extended heavy
   maintenance or approved by the production supervisor or expediter. Land mobile radios may
   be signed out long term to key Squadron positions as designated by the Squadron
   Commander or Squadron Superintendent.
   4.4. CTK custodians will ensure spare and consumable tools are controlled at all times to
   prevent fraud, waste, and abuse by locking them in a secure place, keeping them separated
   from tools issued every day, and inventoried.
   4.5. Personnel authorized to procure tools will be limited to officers, NCOs and civilian
   equivalents that operate and manage support/CTK sections.
   4.6. CTK custodians will not etch replacement tools until they are put into service.
   4.7. Expendable tools such as apex bits and consumable tools such as safety wire spools,
   along with HAZMAT items, with the exception of tooling with self-contained oil/hazmats,
   will be accounted for and will be turned in to the CTK custodian for proper disposal. All
   CTKs that have HAZMAT materials in them will have appropriate Material Safety Data
   Sheets (MSDS) inside the CTK.
   4.8. Secure all broken tools in a controlled, lockable area, until they are processed for
   disposal. Ensure all etchings are completely removed from broken tools prior to disposal.
   CTK custodians will document all removed/broken CTK items on the MIL and in
   TAS/TCMAX.
   4.9. To control items such as crimpers, lead seals, and blade blending blue dye, issue as a kit
   for their intended use.
5. Tool Room, CTK Inventory Procedures.
   5.1. Only authorized personnel designated by squadron/flight will be able to gain unescorted
   entry into tool rooms. Individuals and CTK custodians will conduct a physical inventory of
   all tools and/or equipment at the time of issue and turn-in. Individuals signing out tools
   and/or equipment are responsible for the condition of the tools and/or equipment issued and
   for any damage incurred until relieved by the CTK custodian at turn-in. Individuals signing
   in/out tools and/or equipment are required to report any discrepancies with the item to the
   CTK custodians at time of sign in/out. The CTK custodian will document the discrepancy on
   the MIL and in TAS/TCMAX.

     5.2. Due to shortages of personnel it might be necessary for a single person to sign in and
     sign out a CTK. If this should become necessary, at the start of the next work shift, the shift
     supervisor will inventory the CTK prior to the individual leaving the work area. This
     inventory must be documented.
     5.3. Support section supervisors and CTK custodians will conduct and document a detailed
     inventory annually to include etching, serviceability checks, and accuracy of the MIL for all
     tools and equipment in the tool room. This inventory will include all tools and equipment
     used or maintained in a decentralized location.
     5.4. Mobility and crash recovery tools and equipment can be sealed and stored until needed.
     While in storage these items will be inspected at a minimum of 180-day intervals. These
     items must be tamper-proof sealed, and stored in a secure location. A thorough inspection
     will be performed prior to placing crash recovery and mobility CTKs or equipment into
     service and returning them back to storage. All mobility CTKs and equipment will be
     inspected at 30-day intervals at deployed locations.
     5.5. Crash recovery tools and equipment will be part of the Aero-Repair (A/R) shop main
     inventory and must meet the requirements of this instruction if applicable. The A/R shop
     will identify these items as being sub-located to the crash recovery trailer.
     5.6. CTK/TKs and peculiar test equipment stored outside of a centralized tool room are
     subject to the same security, inspection, and accountability requirements as tools located
     within the centralized facility. These CTK/TKs will be locked when unattended and the keys
     controlled by the CTK custodian or tool room manager when not signed out.
     5.7. In areas such as back shops that do not use a centralized tool room and where tools and
     equipment do not leave the shop area it is permissible for one person to sign out a tool
     cabinet (such as a Stanley Vidmar or roll-away) and allow an entire work crew to use tools
     from that cabinet, as long as the person signing out the CTK is able to maintain positive
     control of the contents. The contents of the cabinet will be inventoried prior to any member
     of the work crew departing the work area in excess of two hours.
6. Rag/Absorbent Material Control.
     6.1. Work centers will treat rags as issued tools. CTK custodians will not issue more than 10
     rags to an individual at one time. At no time will rags be used to plug holes or ports on
     aircraft or subassemblies.
     6.2. Rags received from a supplier will be counted upon receipt and annotated in a log. The
     number of rags placed in bins for contract cleaning will also be annotated on the log to
     ensure accountability.
     6.3. Cheesecloth and absorbent material (this does not include paper towels or chem.-wipes)
     will be treated the same way. When cheesecloth or absorbent material are issued as a roll the
     material will be cut into squares and packaged in bundles of 10. At no time will these
     materials be used on aircraft or in aircraft maintenance areas in any form other than in
     bundles of 10 each. With the exception of Emergency Response Spill Team Operations.
7. Missing/Removed Tools.
     7.1. Any tool missing/removed from the CTK, (i.e., in PMEL, broken or backordered) will
     be documented on the MIL and in TAS/TCMAX.
TRAVISAFBI21-107 26 MARCH 2013                                                                   5


8. Lost Item/Tool Procedures.
   8.1. All personnel will initiate a lost tool investigation report for any lost or missing tools,
   CTKs, test equipment, aircraft parts, technical data, or any personal issue items lost
   anywhere in an aircraft maintenance area.
      8.1.1. Production supervisor or section/shop supervisor will put together a team and
      initiate an in-depth search over the area where the tool was last seen. If the tool is not
      found within one hour of searching, initiate a lost tool investigation report using 60
      AMW Form 514, Lost Tool Report and follow procedures outlined in AFI 21-101 and
      AMCSUP1 to document the lost tool investigation.
   8.2. When the item is lost by a flight crew member, the aircraft commander will place a
   RED X symbol in the aircraft forms along with a description of the item and a specific last-
   known location.
      8.2.1. The aircraft commander will immediately notify the proper expediter/production
      supervisor of the lost item and request a 60 AMW Form 514 if it is not located within one
      hour of searching.
      8.2.2. The aircraft commander will ensure the 60 AMW Form 514 report is complete and
      accurate prior to giving to the production supervisor.
      8.2.3. If at any time during the investigation the item/tool is found and retrieved, or
      found but is inaccessible, the aircraft commander will notify MOC, who in turn will
      notify MXQA, Maintenance Operations Officer (MOO) and/or Superintendent.
   8.3. Production supervisors, or section/shop supervisors will immediately notify their
   maintenance supervision, support section, MOC and MXQA of a lost tool. MOC will be
   responsible for notifying the 60 MXG/CC or designated representative of the lost tool and
   request impoundment guidance. On taxiing or departed aircraft, MOC-1 will be responsible
   for ensuring the aircraft commander, 60 MXG/CC and the 60 OG/CC are immediately
   notified of the lost tool. Maintenance supervision will determine when the search may be
   discontinued and will ensure MOC is notified. Authorization to clear RED Xs when a tool
   cannot be located is limited to no lower than the Maintenance Superintendent.
   8.4. Squadron tool rooms will ensure the 60 AMW Form 514 has been routed and filled out
   correctly. Squadron CTK personnel will forward a copy to the squadron safety NCO. The
   squadron safety NCO will ensure the 60 MXG safety office receives a copy of all lost tool
   reports from their squadron.
   8.5. If the item is lost on an aircraft or engine and not found, 60 MXG safety will forward an
   additional copy to PS&D (aircraft) or Engine Management (engines) to file in aircraft jacket
   file or annotate AFTO Form 95, Significant Historical Data, with the appropriate
   information. An entry will be annotated in the aircraft or engine forms.
   8.6. Whenever tools/equipment are found on an aircraft, notify maintenance supervision,
   MOC, QA and the affected support section. MOC will notify 60 MXG/CC or designated
   representative. Anyone qualified to sign off Red Xs can clear the lost tool entry for tools that
   are found. If the tool/equipment belongs to a squadron located on Travis AFB, that custodian
   will ensure the original 60 AMW Form 514 is annotated and routed back through the
   established channels as prescribed in AFI 21-101 and AMCSUP1. Contact 60th

     information.
9. Personal Equipment.
     9.1. All issued personal protective equipment (i.e., ear defenders, headsets, reflective belts,
     goggles) will be either etched or permanently marked legibly IAW AFI 21-101_AMCSUP_I.
     Personal protective equipment not issued or controlled through CTK procedures are not
     authorized in the aircraft maintenance area.
10. Locally Manufactured/Modified Tools.
     10.1. 60 MXG/QA (Quality Assurance) will coordinate on all locally
     manufactured/modified tools requiring group commander approval based on requirements in
     AFI 21-101 and AMCSUP1.
        10.1.1. All locally manufactured/modified tools used by Aircrew Flight Equipment
        (AFE) work centers will be coordinated with the AFE Quality Assurance Office (OGV
        QA) prior to being approved by the OG/CC or designated representative.
     10.2. When Submitting an approval package include a picture and/or drawing; and a
     description of use for each item. This will be maintained by 60 MXG/QA office and
     formatted per the examples in Attachment 2 and Attachment 3.
     10.3. Units will submit a listing of all approved locally manufactured or modified tools, to
     QA every other year. Users will review items and requirements biennially (every two years)
     for applicability and current configuration. QA will cross-check with those on file within 30
     days to evaluate for applicability and current configuration.
     10.4. Locally manufactured/modified tools coordination package must be kept on file in the
     owning squadron’s work center or support function where a single support function serves
     more than one squadron.
11. Warranted Tool Management.
     11.1. CTK custodians will manage warranted tools and equipment in the same manner as
     other tools and equipment IAW AFI 21-101 and AMCSUP1, and follow tool manufacturer’s
     warranty guidelines.
     11.2. When warranted tools or equipment are no longer serviceable, they will be verified by
     the CTK custodian and documented on an unserviceable log. The unserviceable log will be
     maintained until the item is disposed of. The tools/equipment will then be placed in a secure
     area until processed in accordance with manufacturer/contractor instructions.
12. Other Agencies.
     12.1. Depot teams, factory representatives, contract field teams, and other agencies that work
     on aircraft or unit equipment will be briefed by MXG/QAE on tool and equipment control
