                              MANAGING THE PROGRAMS

1.1. The Role of International Education Programs at USAFA. US national security strategy
emphasizes global engagement, partnership, and expanded mutual security responsibilities. The
Dean of Faculty International Programs (DFIP) prepares cadets to successfully operate as USAF
officers in international environments by providing opportunities to develop foreign language
skills, area expertise, and cultural understanding. DFIP programs are focused on cadet
opportunities and are fully aligned with recent Air Force Chief of Staff guidance to meet Air and
Space Expeditionary Force requirements and with USAFA Strategic Goals and Outcomes.
“Due to the nature of immediate and likely future challenges, our Joint forces require Airmen
capable of influencing the outcomes of US, allied, and coalition operations anywhere in the
world. While we, the Air Force, have made considerable initial progress toward building the
necessary cross-cultural skills, we recognize the existing processes for obtaining this force-
enhancing capability (appropriate culture, region, language and negotiation skills) are not
currently mature or robust enough to optimally meet immediate expectations or near-future
requirements. Therefore, it is imperative that we tailor our cultural, regional, and language
competency development to maximize our efforts and meet Air Force and Joint requirements
informed by National guidance.” (Gen Norton Schwartz, Air Force Culture, Region, and
Language Flight Plan, May 2009)
“If we underestimate the significance of language, region and culture in our global endeavors, we
do so at our own risk and to the detriment of our effectiveness.” (Gen Norton Schwartz, Defense
Department language and culture summit, Jan 2011)
1.2. The Objectives of International Programs at USAFA. The objectives of USAFA’s
international education programs are related to three primary domains, language, culture, and
professional outcomes. To clearly demonstrate the connection between these programs and Air
Force and Air Force Academy guidance, below are identified five purposes of international
programs at USAFA:
   1.2.1. To prepare cadets for service in a multicultural environment by targeting elements of
   the core academic and military curriculum toward greater global awareness and foreign
   language skills—related to Air Force Strategic Goal 1: Foster Mutual Respect and Integrity,
   and USAFA Responsibilities Outcome: Civic, Cultural and International Environments.
   1.2.2. To support the educational and professional development of cadets who have chosen
   to focus on foreign/regional studies and language skills in their academic studies—related to
   Air Force Strategic Goal 4: Develop Joint and Battle Ready Trained Airmen, and USAFA
   Skills Outcome: Oral and Written Communication.
   1.2.3. To enhance cadets’ intercultural understanding through foreign military and cross-
   cultural interactions—related to Air Force Strategic Goal 3: Provide Persistent Situation
   Awareness, and USAFA Knowledge Outcome: Intercultural Competence and Involvement.
   1.2.4. To inspire cadets by providing high-impact learning activities for all personnel at
   USAFA to learn leadership skills, forge character, strengthen cooperation and enhance long-
   term international relations.

     1.2.5. To provide professional enrichment and development for faculty and staff members
     related to the above goals and outcomes.
1.3. Management of International Programs at USAFA. International program oversight is
the responsibility of the International Programs Council (IPC), which includes Department
Heads of Economics and Geosciences (USAFA/DFEG), Foreign Languages (DFF), History
(DFH), Military & Strategic Studies (DFMI), and Political Science (DFPS), Department Head-
level representatives of the Basic Sciences and Engineering Divisions, and, as a non-voting
member, the Director of International Programs (DFIP). One of the council members serves as
the chair of the IPC on a two-year rotational basis. The Office of International Programs (DFIP)
administers and manages all USAFA International Programs through the Dean of Faculty
(USAFA/DF) under this IPC oversight in coordination with the Commandant of Cadets
(USAFA/CW), and is organizationally and administratively subordinated to the Department of
Foreign Languages (USAFA/DFF).
     1.3.1. The Director of the Office of International Programs (USAFA/DFIP) serves as
     Executive Agent to the IPC, and plans and executes meetings of the Council.
     1.3.2. The Area Studies Groups (ASGs) include a Chairperson and any USAFA personnel
     with an active interest in a particular geocultural region. All USAFA teaching faculty with
     geocultural and regional foreign expertise, and USAFA’s foreign exchange officers are
     expected to participate in their appropriate ASGs. The ASGs include:
        1.3.2.1. African.
        1.3.2.2. Asian.
        1.3.2.3. Latin American.
        1.3.2.4. Middle Eastern.
        1.3.2.5. Slavic & E European.
        1.3.2.6. Western European.
     1.3.3. Any ASG member may nominate any other member to be the Chairperson. The
     nomination is made to DFIP. The IPC is the approval authority.

         FOREIGN DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS AND OFFICIAL VISITS

3.1. General Rules:
   3.1.1. Roles: The USAFA Information Protection office (HQ USAFA/IP) serves as the
   primary Foreign Disclosure Office for the Air Force Academy. In conjunction with the
   Office of Faculty and Cadet Research (DFER), DFIP serves as an Assistant Foreign
   Disclosure Office, supporting HQ USAFA/IP. Every USAFA-assigned military, US
   Government civilian, and civilian contractor employee is required to monitor and comply
   with foreign disclosure and foreign visit approval directives. Access to materials identified
   as Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) or higher must be restricted from all foreign
   nationals unless appropriately and specifically approved for release.
   3.1.2. DFIP and DFER responsibilities: The Office of International Programs (DFIP) is
   responsible for processing all official Foreign Visit Requests (FVRs) to USAFA. FVRs
   originate from the foreign government’s defense attaché office at their embassy in the United
   States and go through SAF/IA to USAFA/DFIP. DFIP reviews FVRs submitted to USAFA
   for approval. DFIP is also available to advise US travelers to foreign countries on submitting
   and monitoring country clearance requests, and to field passport and visa questions. DFER
   manages the Engineering and Scientist Exchange Program, conference presentations,
   international research collaborations, and any other items related to export control of
   technology, in conjunction with HQ USAFA/IP.
   3.1.3. Information Protection Training and Staff Assistance. DFIP may consult with
   HQ USAFA/IP for expertise in foreign disclosure issues.
   3.1.4. Information Disclosure: USAFA personnel may not disclose any official
   information (classified or controlled unclassified) to foreign nationals without prior
   coordination with HQ USAFA/IP, DFIP or DFER as specified in this instruction. Depending
   on the information to be disclosed, it may require approval from the office of the Under
   Secretary of the Air Force for International Affairs, Foreign Disclosure Branch (SAF/IAPD)
   3.1.5. Visits:
   3.1.6. Foreign Visitors to USAFA: USAFA/DFIP is the installation authority for granting
   official foreign visit request approvals and for coordinating with the office of the Under
   Secretary of the Air Force for International Affairs, Visits and Special Projects Branch
   (SAF/IAD).
      3.1.6.1. Unofficial Visits: Foreign visitors who are strictly tourists, personal guests of
      on-base residents, or guests of USAFA employees may visit USAFA facilities that are
      commonly accessible to the general public, also referred to as the Visitor Cordon, without
      prior approval, but are subject to the provisions of paragraph 3.2., below. If these guests
      visit the Cadet Area in an unofficial capacity, then a foreign visit request may not be
      required.
          3.1.6.1.1. If a foreign visit request is required for an unofficial visit: USAFA/DFIP is
          the USAFA installation approving authority.
12                                                           USAFAI16-101 24 APRIL 2012


         3.1.6.1.2. Notify USAFA/DFIP (30 days in advance, preferred) of the proposed visit.
         Provide details concerning the visit in writing, specifically who will visit (including

         assigned as the USAFA OPR for the visit.
         3.1.6.1.3. In cases of HQ USAFA/CC invitations to foreigners, the Protocol Office
         (HQ USAFA/CCP) coordinates with USAFA/DFIP.
         3.1.6.1.4. Await USAFA/DFIP approval before agreeing to or conducting the visit.
         Do not assume that you have approval.
     3.1.6.2. Official Visits: All official visits to USAFA by foreign nationals in an official
     capacity require advance coordination with USAFA/DFIP regardless of the duration of
     the visit.
  3.1.7. Short-duration Official Visits: All official business short-duration visits by foreign
  nationals require advance approval from USAFA/DFIP.
  3.1.8. Extended-stay Foreign National Visits (i.e., long-term contractors, researchers, and
  exchange officers) must receive advance approval from USAFA/DFIP or DFER.
  3.1.9. Badging Requirements: Approved foreign national visitors must be escorted at all
  times. Extended-stay personnel are authorized to be properly badged. In these cases,
  proximity badges will indicate that individual is a foreign national. Refer to USAFA 31-1,
  Integrated Defense Plan on the procedures for FN proximity badge requests.
     3.1.9.1. The proper form of identification for extended-stay visitors is the USAFA-issued
     proximity badge. For 4-year International Cadets, USAFA/CW will specify appropriate
     name tags for all cadet uniform combinations that clearly identify the individual’s name
     and country. Additional requirements may be imposed, depending on the current security
     situation and commander’s guidance.
  3.1.10. Visits of USAFA-assigned Foreign Nationals to other US Military Installations
  (including research and development facilities, and laboratories). This section pertains to 4-
  year international cadets, semester exchange cadets, officers on the Personnel Exchange
  Program, extended-stay researchers, and contractor personnel.
     3.1.10.1. The following information is required when submitting a foreign visit request
     to the appropriate MAJCOM Foreign Disclosure Officer: Name, Grade, and SSNs of
     travelers, itinerary, purpose of the visit, Point of Contact (POC) at the host unit (and
     phone number), and responsible USAFA escort officer (if applicable). The USAFA unit
     commander of any international personnel who is sponsoring a trip is responsible to
     submit such a request and may contact USAFA/DFIP for assistance.
     3.1.10.2. The commander or designated representative then contacts the appropriate
     MAJCOM Foreign Disclosure Officer and requests approval for the visit.
     3.1.10.3. If incentive/orientation flights are planned, the commander or representative
     must inform the FDO and host-base representative that foreign nationals will participate
     in the visit so that classified, NOFORN, and proprietary equipment/information on
     military aircraft can be adequately protected.
USAFAI16-101 24 APRIL 2012                                                                     13


       3.1.10.4. These requirements also apply to all visits to Colorado Springs-area
       installations (Peterson AFB, Cheyenne Mountain, Schriever AFB, and Fort Carson).
       With proper US military identification, however, USAFA-assigned foreign nationals may
       visit Peterson AFB and/or Fort Carson without advance clearance to use the commissary,
       exchange, recreational facilities, hospital, and public-access facilities. Foreign national
       cadets do not need visit clearance for Peterson AFB when participating in a scheduled
       cadet orientation/incentive flight.
3.2. Planning and Execution of Official and Unofficial Visits:
   3.2.1. Official Visits: Include visits (regardless of duration) by foreign nationals,
   representing their foreign government, to conduct business with any USAFA-
   assigned/employed individual, attend conferences, or to tour any USAFA facility except
   private homes on-base and those facilities normally open to the general public (i.e., Visitors
   Center, Chapel, etc.). This section does not apply to international officers assigned to
   USAFA under the Military Personnel Exchange Program (see Chapter 4), 4-year
   international cadets (see Chapter 5), or Cadet Semester Exchange Abroad Program cadets,
   i.e., semester exchange cadets (see Chapter 6).
   3.2.2. Before considering an official visit, the host must:
       3.2.2.1. The commander or designated representative of the organization to be visited
       (the USAFA host or OPR) will review the proposed information to be exchanged. If
       Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) or classified information might be released or
       discussed, notify USAFA/DFIP immediately. OSI is available to provide general
       security briefings to all individuals participating in the planning of foreign visits. Host
       may contact OSI for security briefings.
       3.2.2.2. Host will appoint a USAFA OPR for the visit. For assistance with the FVR, host
       should provide details concerning the visit to USAFA/DFIP in writing, specifically who
       will visit (including passport number and nationality), what, when, where, and for what
       purpose. Include the level of information to be released. Representative of the foreign
       government must submit an FVR through the defense attaché office at their embassy in
       the United States. In cases of HQ USAFA/CC invitations to foreign visitors, the Protocol
       Office (HQ USAFA/CCP) coordinates with USAFA/DFIP for clearance. If the visit
       includes the airfield (306 Flying Training Group (306 FTG)), then the USAFA OPR must
       contact AETC/IAD for approval. Even though the 306 FTG operates on USAFA, the
       unit reports to AETC, and the defense attaché of the foreign government must specify in
       a FVR the intention to visit that MAJCOM.
       3.2.2.3. Await USAFA/DFIP approval before agreeing to or conducting the visit. Do not
       assume that you have approval.
       3.2.2.4. Plan for the visitor(s) to be escorted at all times.
   3.2.3. During the Visit:
       3.2.3.1. The USAFA OPR must ensure compliance with all current USAFA security and
       access requirements. Unless approved by USAFA/DFER as an employee or extended-
       stay researcher, foreign visitors will not be given access codes or proximity cards to any
       USAFA facility.
14                                                            USAFAI16-101 24 APRIL 2012


     3.2.3.2. If approved by USAFA/DFER, international visitors may be granted unescorted
     access during normal duty hours within the classroom areas of Fairchild Hall (building
     2354, floors 4 and 5 and hallways, elevators, and stairs leading to these floors) only.
     3.2.3.3. Foreign visitors must be escorted while in all other USAFA locations (to include
     the 2nd and 6th floors of Fairchild Hall, the library, and all labs and research facilities.)
     Upon request by the USAFA OPR to the USAFA/DFER Assistant Foreign Disclosure
     Officer, specific access exceptions may be made by DFER after review of the visit
     request.
     3.2.3.4. Foreign visitors (regardless of the duration of stay) will not be allowed access to
     the usafa.edu or usafa.mil network computer system without proper approval of the 10th
     Communication Squadron Director (10 CS/CL). USAFA personnel will not give their
     personal computer passwords, nor allow foreign visitors to use their USAFANet accounts
     to access the USAFANet or the Internet.
     3.2.3.5. The USAFA OPR must ensure that all briefings, presentations, materials, data,
     and US Government documents given to the foreign visitor clearly indicate their purpose.
     Mark any such materials with the following statement: “This briefing/ presentation/
     document is for information only. No US Government commitment to sell, loan, lease,
     co-develop or co-produce defense articles is implied or intended.” This includes
     USAFA-generated academic and informational materials, but excludes publicly available
     textbooks, courseware, brochures and pamphlets.
  3.2.4. Official Visits by Representatives (military or civilian) of Foreign
  Governments: With the exception of certain OSD or HQ USAF-initiated events, official
  visits to USAFA must be pre-approved (at least 30 days in advance is advised) by DFIP and
  SAF/IA through the foreign visit system.
     3.2.4.1. USAFA host should notify USAFA/DFIP of the proposed visit and appoint an
     OPR for the visit. Provide details concerning the visit in writing, specifically who will
     visit (including passport number and nationality), what, when, where, and the purpose of
     the visit. In cases of HQ USAFA/CC invitations to foreigners, the Protocol Office (HQ
     USAFA/CCP) coordinates with USAFA/DFIP. If no USAFA host has been designated,
     DFIP may appoint one based on the visitors’ area(s) of interest. As warranted,
     USAFA/DFIP may recommend a USAFA host to the Vice Dean (DFV), Vice
     Commandant (CWV) or Vice Superintendent (HQ USAFA/CV), who may designate an
     OPR for the visit.
     3.2.4.2. Before USAFA/DFIP can grant approval, the visit must be officially requested
     by the foreign embassy’s military attaché office in Washington, DC to SAF/IA, even if
     the visitor was invited by a USAFA agency. The visitor must initiate the request through
     their official channels. USAFA cannot initiate a foreign visit request to a foreign
     embassy.
     3.2.4.3. If you invite a foreign visitor, you must advise them of the requirements of this
     section. Do not assume that they will automatically request approval through their
     embassy. Failure to comply will result in denial of access to USAFA.
USAFAI16-101 24 APRIL 2012                                                                      15


     3.2.4.4. Official visit requests are forwarded from SAF/IAD to USAFA/DFIP.
     Following review, USAFA/DFIP will issue an approval or disapproval recommendation
     to SAF/IA.
     3.2.4.5. USAFA OPR must await USAFA/DFIP approval before agreeing to or
     conducting the official visit. Do not assume that you have approval.
  3.2.5. Extended-stay, Official Business Foreign Nationals: This section encompasses
  foreign national researchers, faculty members, contractors, proposed employees (to include
  Non-Appropriated Fund (NAF) employees), and Engineer and Scientist Exchange Program
  (ESEP) participants.
     3.2.5.1. General: USAFA/DFER is the installation coordination and approval authority
     for all extended-stay foreign nationals on official business. The requestor is the office,
     department, or laboratory desiring to host a foreign visitor. Await USAFA/DFER
     approval before committing to the potential extended-stay employee, researcher or
     visitor.
         3.2.5.1.1. Requestors must evaluate the level of information that may be disclosed as
         a part of their guest’s duties, and establish procedures to protect sensitive information.
     3.2.5.2. Approval Package: Before making any binding commitments, requestor

     information to be disclosed. Submit these documents to USAFA/DFER.
     3.2.5.3. Coordination: Forward an electronic copy of the SSS approval package
     directly to USAFA/DFER. Route the hard-copy SSS package as follows:
         3.2.5.3.1. For proposed USAFA/DF-assigned faculty and researchers: coordinate the
         package through the appropriate DF Department Head, the DF Security Manager, and
         HQ USAFA/IP, to USAFA/DFER for approval.
         3.2.5.3.2. For proposed USAFA personnel who will be assigned to organizations
         other than USAFA/DF: coordinate the package through the supervisor, appropriate
         unit commander, and unit security manager to USAFA/DFER for approval.
     3.2.5.4. Official Visitors Arriving Without Advance SAF/IA Approval: Official
     visitors arriving at USAFA without prior clearance will not be granted access to the non-
     public areas of the installation, and may have to depart without completing the visit. If
     you are contacted by a foreign official visitor who has arrived without prior visit approval
     coordinated through USAFA/DFIP, comply with the following:
         3.2.5.4.1. Coordinate immediately with USAFA/DFIP.
         3.2.5.4.2. The USAFA OPR must have the visitor contact his/her embassy’s defense

        unofficial visitor and will be denied access to any of the non-public access areas of
        USAFA.
        3.2.5.4.4. It is the responsibility of the USAFA OPR to adequately care for the visitor

   4.1.3. When an exchange officer’s native language permits, to foster language education in
   that tongue for USAFA cadets.
   4.1.4. To promote mutual understanding and trust.
   4.1.5. To strengthen air force-to-air force ties.
4.2. USAFA/DFIP Responsibilities: USAFA/DFIP is the program management office for
USAFA and as such is the main POC for all matters pertaining to international officers assigned
to USAFA. Duties include:

                  FOUR-YEAR INTERNATIONAL CADET PROGRAM

5.1. Program Foundation and Overview. Public Law 98-94, first enacted in 1983, Title 10
USC, Chapters 403, 603, and 903, and DoD Directive 1322.22, Service Academies, prescribe the
admission of foreign nationals to USAFA’s 4-year cadet program. The purpose of the 4-year
international cadet program is to educate bright young students from around the world who will
serve in their countries’ military services or in their governments, and to provide opportunities
for cultural education to US cadets through the presence of the internationals. Each year, the
Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Policy (OUSDP), Internal Security Affairs (ISA), and
Financial Management Review and Analysis (FMRA), after consultation with the Department of
State and SAF/IA, solicits, through American Embassy US Defense Attaché Offices (USDAO),
to foreign defense ministries, nominations for applicants to USAFA. Shortly thereafter, the Air
Force Academy Admissions Office HQ USAFA/RRS provides USDAOs specific qualification
guidelines and application procedures. HQ USAFA/RR then screens international applicants as
a part of the admissions process. After SAF/IA coordination, the Academy Board offers
appointments to selected international applicants in the spring of each year. Goals of the
program include the following:
   5.1.1. To provide an opportunity for cultural exchange, for all USAFA cadets to learn about
   the international cadets’ home culture and for international cadets to learn about American,
   regional, and Air Force institutional culture.
   5.1.2. To foster professional ties between young people serving in the armed forces of their
   allied nations.
   5.1.3. To provide opportunities for cadets to learn world languages from native speakers.
   5.1.4. To promote mutual understanding and respect.
5.2. Responsibilities and Guidelines:
   5.2.1. Admissions: International cadet admission packages are coordinated and staffed by
   HQ USAFA/RR. Once accepted, HQ USAFA/RR forwards certificates of appointment to
   American Embassy USDAOs for presentation to the prospective international cadets.
       5.2.1.1. Once the appointment is accepted by the cadet and his/her country,
       HQ USAFA/RR notifies USAFA/DFIP and includes the cadet on all rosters for the
       incoming class.
       5.2.1.2. USAFA/DFIP will establish a USAFA arrival date for new international cadets
       approximately 1 week prior to the commencement of Basic Cadet Training so that they
       may attend the International Cadet Orientation Program (ICOP). HQ USAFA/RR will
       coordinate the arrival date, publish orders, and issue tickets as required for the newly
       appointed international cadets.
   5.2.2. Guidelines and Instructions: USAFA/DFIP is the office of primary responsibility
   (OPR) for all administrative matters pertaining to the international cadets from in-processing
   through graduation/out-processing.
20                                                            USAFAI16-101 24 APRIL 2012


     5.2.2.1. USAFA/CW will exercise day-to-day oversight and accountability for the
     international cadets. With few exceptions as specified in this chapter, international cadets
     will participate in all facets of cadet training and education and will be treated the same
     as US cadets in all matters to include academic and military requirements, honor, and
     other similar matters.
     5.2.2.2. Honor and Legal Issues: IAW Title 10 USC, Sec. 9344 (c)(1), foreign cadets
     are “subject to the same regulations governing admission, attendance, discipline,
     resignation, discharge, dismissal, and graduation as a cadet at the Academy appointed
     from the United States.”
        5.2.2.2.1. Legal, military, honor, or academic sanctions that may result in
        incarceration or dismissal from the academy, if reasonable, will not be administered
        without prior coordination by USAFA/DFIP with appropriate SAF/IA, DoD, State
        Department, and parent-government agencies, as required. If not reasonable prior to
        administration of incarceration or dismissal, USAFA/DFIP will coordinate with the
        appropriate named agencies in a timely manner. USAFA mission elements and
        agencies will notify DFIP as soon as an incident/event is reported and keep DFIP up-
        to-date on progress of proceedings and the proposed resolution.
        5.2.2.2.2. No official/final legal action/sanctions outside of the current MOU/SOFA
        can be taken against the cadet until coordination is complete.
        5.2.2.2.3. DFIP will keep appropriate SAF/IA, State Department, and foreign
        government agencies informed, as required.
        5.2.2.2.4. Drug Testing: International cadets can be included in all drug testing.
        Failure to comply with testing and test failures will be reported immediately to DFIP,
        who will contact HQ USAFA/JA, SAF/IA, State Department, and/or the appropriate
        foreign government agencies for guidance.
     5.2.2.3. Parental/Home Government Notification (medical emergency, late return,
     etc.): Contact with foreign governments or parents should only be made after careful
     consideration of language differences, protocol, etc. In all cases, DFIP is the only
     USAFA agency authorized to contact parent government entities or family members.
     DFIP will initiate necessary contact with the home government or parents through
     SAF/IA and/or the appropriate US Embassy Defense Attaché.
     5.2.2.4. Late Return to USAFA (leave, etc.): En route travel delays experienced by a 4-
     year international cadet returning to USAFA from their home country (summer/winter
     break, etc.) can result in a significantly late return to USAFA. International cadets who
     travel to their home country on leave are not considered overdue until after 48 hours has
     elapsed. These cadets, however, are required to notify USAFA/CW of the delay IAW
     applicable cadet instructions, if at all possible.
        5.2.2.4.1. USAFA/CW should notify DFIP of the delay or late arrival notification.
        For no-shows, DFIP will not attempt contact with home countries/parents until after
        the 48 hour period.
     5.2.2.5. Winter Break: In order to give international cadets similar leave opportunity to
     US cadets (with special consideration for the distance international cadets must travel
USAFAI16-101 24 APRIL 2012                                                                      21


      home), they may request additional leave days. This request (via SCA) must be made in
      advance and must receive approval before the cadet may take advantage of any additional
      leave days.
5.3. In-Processing: Upon cadets’ arrival, USAFA/DFIP will become the primary
administrative OPR for all matters pertaining to the international cadets’ stay at USAFA.
   5.3.1. USAFA/DFIP:
      5.3.1.1. Will conduct the International Cadet Orientation Program (ICOP) for incoming
      cadets to include in-processing with Cadet Personnel. International cadets arrive 7-10
      days prior to the start of Basic Cadet Training and are provided with a series of briefings
      to prepare them for BCT and life at USAFA. They receive Honor Code briefings,
      assistance with banking accounts, and social security numbers. During ICOP, DFIP will
      sponsor local immersion opportunities to help the cadets become acclimated to American
      or regional culture.
      5.3.1.2. Will solicit and coordinate volunteer sponsor families to host the new cadets and
      help them acclimate to American and USAF culture during ICOP. These same families
      can continue to sponsor the cadet throughout their time at USAFA, if desired
      (USAFA/DFIP will coordinate these requests with the Cadet Sponsor Office).
      5.3.1.3. Will ensure the international cadets report as directed for BCT in-processing.
5.4. Academic Year Programs: Once international cadets complete BCT, they are fully
integrated into USAFA’s academic, military, athletic, and social life. There are only a few
exceptions:
   5.4.1. The Director, USAFA/DFIP, or designee, serves as special advisor to the 4-year
   international cadets, monitoring their academic program performance and coordinating with
   academic advisors as needed.
   5.4.2. In the fall semester of their Fourth Class year, international cadets must enroll in
   English 109, “Academic Communication for English as a Second Language Student,” a
   special course taught by the Department of English (DFENG). This course is designed to
   ensure the international cadets have the necessary English language skills to succeed as a
   cadet, and to help them acclimate to the culture of the United States, Colorado and the
   Academy. By Lesson 2, DFENG may evaluate each international cadet’s knowledge of the
   English language and American culture. Based on this evaluation, DFENG may elect to
   waive English 109 and move proficient cadets to more advanced courses.
   5.4.3. DFR and DFIP may create a separate section of the First Year Experience course
   (FYE) for the 4-year international cadets. DFIP assigns an instructor and the group of
   international 4-degree cadets complete all requirements of FYE in the context of their
   international peers.
   5.4.4. International cadets are not required, as part of core academic curricular requirements,
   to study a foreign language. They may, however, do so voluntarily.
   5.4.5. International cadets may participate in any of the cadet international education
   programs sponsored by DFIP except for the Cadet Semester Exchange Abroad Program.
   Only on very rare occasions, and with the approval of DFIP, will international cadets be
   permitted to participate in summer language immersion programs. International cadets may
 22                                                            USAFAI16-101 24 APRIL 2012


   participate in Ops Air Force at foreign bases at the discretion of the USAFA/CW. In no case
   will an international cadet be the only representative of USAFA on a foreign visit.
   Additionally, the USAFA delegation must always be led by a US cadet. DFIP may sponsor
   immersion opportunities to help the cadets become acclimated to American or regional
   culture.
   5.4.6. International cadets may not take the Defense Language Proficiency Test.
   5.4.7. International cadets are seen as contributors to, and participants in, area studies
   groups’ activities. Participation must conform to time allocated to the Dean of Faculty IAW
   the current schedule of calls or have advance SCA approval.
5.5. Summer Programs:
   5.5.1. International cadets must receive the same military credit for summer programs as US
   cadets and may participate in all facets of USAFA summer training. It is important,
   however, to afford international cadets every opportunity to engage with their parent Air
   Force and the officers and peers with whom they will eventually serve. To the maximum
   extent possible, international cadets will be afforded the opportunity to substitute all USAFA
   summer military training programs (including Global Engagement, Basic Cadet Training
   [BCT] Cadre, etc.) with pre-coordinated training with their parent Air Force, subject to the
   following conditions:
      5.5.1.1. To have an international cadet return to their parent country in the summer for
      training, a military representative of the parent country must submit a request.
      International cadets are encouraged to work with their Defense Attaché or other official
      to coordinate this request. The request must include the dates and overview of the type of
      training in which the cadet will participate.
      5.5.1.2. International cadets are encouraged to participate in parent-country military
      training programs for up to six weeks each summer and may receive credit for two
      USAFA summer training programs annually.
      5.5.1.3. Cadets may not participate in more than six weeks of training with their parent-
      Air Force during any summer. The third summer three-week period may be afforded to
      the cadet for leave (in-country leave is permissible). In certain instances, where the
      academic success and graduation of the cadet depends upon it, USAFA may direct the
      cadet to return to the Academy to fulfill academic requirements, as required.
      5.5.1.4. In-country training conducted during international cadets’ third, second, and first
      class summer need not substitute on a one-for-one basis for Global Engagement, Ops Air
      Force, etc., but should be appropriate for a cadet undergoing training with the parent Air
      Force.
      5.5.1.5. International cadets remain bound by the USAFA honor code while participating
      in training with their parent Air Force.
   5.5.2. USAFA/DFIP is the approval authority for international cadet participation in parent
   Air Force summer training and will coordinate the individual programs through USAFA/CW.
5.6. Graduation/Departure from USAFA:

   5.6.1. USAFA’s responsibility for the international cadet ceases upon graduation, dismissal,
   or self-initiated departure. International cadets are out-processed IAW standard USAFA
   procedures. The appropriate Air Officer Commanding (AOC) will ensure that the departing
   cadets’ USAF and USAFA identification cards are turned in prior to departure.
   5.6.2. Orders, shipment of personal effects, and departure travel arrangements to any
   destination outside of the international cadets’ home country must receive advance approval
   from USAFA/DFIP with concurrence from SAF/IA and the appropriate parent government’s
   defense attaché, as appropriate.
   5.6.3. USAFA/DFIP will terminate international cadets’ student status through the
   appropriate US Citizenship and Immigration Services system in a timely manner.
5.7. Responsibilities:
   5.7.1. USAFA/DFIP:
       5.7.1.1. Solicits sponsors to host international cadets in their homes during the

          the card to Cadet Personnel (HQ USAFA/A1A) and 10th Medical Group (10 MDG)
          for medical and dental care.
       5.7.1.3. Serves as ombudsman and special advisers for international cadets.
          5.7.1.3.1. USAFA/DFIP will assist the international cadet in resolving issues with
          instructors, AOCs, academic advisors, etc. DFIP monitors cadet academic and
          military progress, and counsels with international cadets on a regular basis. At
          “prog” or mid-semester, DFIP will identify deficient international cadets. If
          warranted, DFIP contacts instructors, academic advisors, and AOCs to discuss each
          cadet’s situation.
24                                                          USAFAI16-101 24 APRIL 2012

     from USAFA for academic, honor, aptitude, conduct, or physical fitness shortcomings,
     DFIP notifies SAF/IA. DFIP obtains background on the political and social implications
     of a cadet’s dismissal and makes recommendations to CW and DF. DFIP also contacts
     the individual cadet to ascertain his/her perspective. DFIP does not contact foreign
     embassy personnel or foreign government personnel directly regarding specific cadet
     issues. SAF/IA makes initial contact with the foreign embassy/government personnel
     and passes contact information to DFIP as necessary.

                CADET SEMESTER EXCHANGE ABROAD PROGRAMS

6.1. Program Intent. Cadet Semester Exchange Abroad Programs (CSEAP) are designed to
respond to US Air Force requirements for officers proficient in language, region, and culture
skills, who can better support the Air Force’s strategy of global engagement. Extended in-
country language and cultural immersion programs are the most successful way to increase
language fluency and cultural understanding. Such programs conducted at foreign military
academies in the context of disciplinary coursework supporting the cadets’ chosen majors and
satisfying core course requirements have the added benefit of educating USAFA cadets on the
armed forces and professional cultures of other countries. Similarly, affording foreign semester
exchange cadets from foreign academies an opportunity for a semester of study at USAFA
furthers engagement and cooperation between air forces and provides strong, mutually beneficial
educational dividends for both academies. Most exchange agreements are established with
international academies where English is not a primary or official language. However, for a
limited number of programs, USAFA recognizes that experience at academies where English is
spoken may foster cross-cultural competence and strengthen alliances. Goals of the program
include the following:
   6.1.1. To develop cadets’ language skills through this capstone, semester-length immersion
   program.
   6.1.2. To foster a deeper understanding of specific cultures and to awaken in students a
   greater connection to the importance of culture general, including ways in which culture can
   affect military operations across the spectrum.
   6.1.3. To promote robust professional relationships that may serve the United States and our
   allies in the years to come.
6.2. Program Overview. Selected USAFA cadets attend partner foreign academies for an
entire semester. During the same academic year, a reciprocal number of foreign cadets from
these international air force academies attend USAFA during USAFA’s fall or spring semester.
All of the USAFA and foreign semester exchange cadets are integrated into the academic,
military, athletic, and social aspects of the host academy. In addition, both USAFA and foreign
semester exchange cadets are afforded special opportunities to experience the cultures of the host
country and to observe operations of the host country’s academy and operational air force.
   6.2.1. Accountability. During participation in outbound international education programs,
   cadets report to DFIP. If leave is taken before or after an international education program,
   cadets will report to their Academic Year (AY) AOCs for command and control functions
   pursuant to leave status. Cadets must report in and out with their AOCs and DFIP at program
   beginning and end to ensure proper accountability. All USAFA/DFIP-sponsored programs
   begin and end at USAFA or a local area airport. Any exceptions must be coordinated by
   each cadet’s AOC and approved by the Director of DFIP or designated representative. For
   example, when a program starts during a leave period and a cadet has departed USAFA, the
   cadet must return to USAFA or a local area airport before beginning TDY travel or else
   secure coordination and approval for an exception. This is also true if a cadet wishes to take
   leave en route prior to returning to USAFA from a CSEAP.

6.3. Selection Process. Second- or Third-Class cadets with a minimum 2.60 cumulative GPA
and MPA who will have completed at least the Foreign Language 222 course in the appropriate
language prior to the exchange are eligible to apply. Boards may stipulate more stringent
requirements for particular semester exchange programs, e.g. second-class cadets who will have
completed foreign language 321 or 322. Participants may not be on any probationary status at
the time of participation. Excellence in foreign language courses or performance on foreign
language tests is a critical element of the application process. Interested and eligible cadets may
apply via DFIP’s on-line application process that DFIP announces to the Cadet Wing early in
each fall semester. The Vice Dean may approve waivers for cadet eligibility on an exceptional
basis. The Vice Dean may delegate this authority to the Director, DFIP. DFIP, working with the
Department of Foreign Language division chiefs or language executors screens cadet applicants
for the various exchanges after a review of USAFA cadet applicant academic, military and
physical training records, to include a recommendation from the air officer commanding and
essays written by the candidates. Each division chief in DFF appoints a language executor to
coordinate the activities of a selection board for each language. Under the authority of the
Director, DFIP, the language executor, in concert with the DFIP program manager, appoints a
chair and seats the board of at least three members. The boards, convened for each language
taught at USAFA, are to include representatives from DFIP, faculty members of the Department
of Foreign Languages, and may also include Area Studies Group representation and a
USAFA/CW representative. Selection boards invite some or all of the pre-qualified cadets to
interview. Criteria to be considered by the board in selecting from the pre-qualified cadets must
emphasize the cadets’ academic achievement, military performance, and demonstrated ability to
perform independently, not strictly the relative order of merit of the candidates. Director, DFIP,
will review and forward names of the selected cadets to the Vice Dean of the Faculty and Vice
Commandant of Cadets for approval. Cadets are notified late in the fall semester.
6.4. Hosting Foreign Semester Exchange Cadets at USAFA:
   6.4.1. Foreign semester exchange cadets will have First Class, Superintendent’s List
   privileges and responsibilities. DFIP will conduct a Semester Exchange Cadet Orientation
   Program (SECOP) for incoming foreign semester exchange cadets to include in-processing
   with Cadet Personnel. During SECOP, DFIP may sponsor immersion opportunities to help
   the cadets become acclimated to American or regional culture. Pending individual AOC
   approval, they should be granted opportunities to participate in training and afforded
   additional time off from duties to travel and experience America. Moreover, they are to be
   granted one special pass which extends a 3-day weekend into a 4-day weekend during the
   semester. One or two USAFA cadets may accompany them (with AOC, instructor, and DFIP
   approval). In addition, foreign semester exchange cadets will be given a 6-day pass in
   conjunction with Thanksgiving or spring break for DFIP-approved cultural travel.
   6.4.2. Foreign semester exchange cadets must attend at least one home football game (Army
   or Navy game suggested). Additionally, these cadets are highly encouraged to utilize their
   weekends and time off for cultural learning through travel. For all travel, foreign semester
   exchange cadets must sign out IAW applicable Cadet Wing guidelines.
   6.4.3. Foreign semester exchange cadets and designated USAFA cadet escorts, where
   possible, will be counted with the official contingent and attend the Army or Navy away
   football games. These slots are not expected to count against cadet squadron allocations.
USAFAI16-101 24 APRIL 2012                                                                   29


   6.4.4. Foreign semester exchange cadets will not be eligible for Element Leader
   responsibilities but will be permitted to hold other 2-degree positions in their squadrons to
   facilitate their learning about Cadet Wing leadership. Foreign semester exchange cadets will
   be required to participate in one military training weekend, to be coordinated with the AOC.
   AOCs are expected to release foreign semester exchange cadets from the remaining military
   training weekends. These cadets are required to participate in commissioning education and
   all military training during the duty week.
   6.4.5. Foreign semester exchange cadets will be admonished for infractions of discipline in
   accordance with current Cadet Wing instructions and under the agreed MOU guidelines.
   6.4.6. Foreign semester exchange cadets may undergo flight screening and participate in
   SCUBA, AM-490 (free-fall parachuting), AM-251 (soaring), and be afforded opportunities
   for incentive/familiarization flights in as many operational aircraft as is feasible.
   6.4.7. During their semester at USAFA, foreign semester exchange cadets will tour USAF
   units or US cultural sites with DFIP. These programs could include DFIP-coordinated and
   organized trips to military installations, properly coordinated per foreign disclosure
   requirements, or to sites of cultural interest.
6.5. Cadet Responsibilities:
   6.5.1. USAFA cadets selected for exchanges must follow the preparatory guidelines detailed
   in the USAFA Curriculum Handbook.

       improvement. Include in the AAR photos with captions, an assessment of the
       educational program and of accomplishment of the program goals, statements of cultural
       learning and the impact of the experience on the cadets, both professionally and
       personally. Promptly submit the after action report. The AAR will be retained one
       semester, and may be retained longer if determined useful by the program manager or
       Director DFIP.
   6.5.3. All cadet participants must comply with all requirements identified by DFIP.
   6.5.4. Culture Education. As directed by DFIP, cadets on selected programs will participate

   completion to the DFIP program manager. This credit request may include credit for any
   foreign language courses taken and FAS 495 for the cadets’ experiential learning and/or
   successful completion of DFIP’s culture education curriculum, if the cadet earns academic
   credit for four or fewer course otherwise. The total course credit transfer will not exceed six
   classes unless the academic advisor requests special consideration.
   6.5.7. CW Training (CWT) will ensure USAFA cadets who successfully complete an
   exchange program will receive Military Leadership credit for the experience if warranted.
   6.5.8. Prior to a semester exchange program, cadets must notify the language executor and

                   CADET SEMESTER STUDY ABROAD PROGRAMS

7.1. Program Intent: Cadet Semester Study Abroad Programs are designed to respond to US
Air Force requirements for foreign language proficient officers possessing global skills, who can
better support USAF’s strategy of global engagement. In-country education in a cadet’s
academic discipline, conducted in the context of language and cultural immersion is the most
successful way to increase language fluency and cultural understanding. Such programs at
foreign civilian universities, in the context of disciplinary coursework supporting the cadets’
chosen major and satisfying core course requirements, offer the benefit of educating USAFA
cadets in the target language. Goals of the program include the following:
   7.1.1. To develop cadets’ language skills through this capstone, semester-length immersion
   program.
   7.1.2. To foster a deeper understanding of a specific foreign culture and hopefully to awaken
   in students a greater connection to the importance of culture general, including ways in
   which culture can affect military operations across the spectrum.
   7.1.3. To promote professional development that may serve the United States and our allies
   in the years to come.
7.2. Program Overview: Each semester, USAFA cadets study at foreign civilian universities.
The cadets are integrated into the academic, cultural, and social environment of the host country
by attending disciplinary coursework in the target language and special travel, volunteer, or other
USAFA/DFIP-approved activities. The guidance in the chapter on the Cadet Semester Exchange
Abroad Program also applies to this program.
   7.2.1. Accountability. During the execution of international education programs, cadets
   report to DFIP. If leave is taken before or after an international education program, cadets
   will report to their AY AOCs for command and control functions pursuant to leave status.
   Cadets must report in and out with their AOCs and DFIP prior to and immediately following
   program execution to ensure proper accountability. All USAFA/DFIP-sponsored programs
   begin and end at USAFA or a local area airport. Any exceptions must be coordinated by
   each cadet’s AOC and approved by the Director of DFIP or designated representative. For
   example, when a program starts during a leave period and a cadet has departed USAFA, the
   cadet must return to USAFA or a local area airport before beginning TDY travel or else
   secure coordination and approval for an exception. This is also true if a cadet wishes to take
   leave en route prior to returning to USAFA from a DFIP-sponsored international activity.
7.3. Selection Process: The selection process is nearly identical to that for CSEAP students,
and typically one board per language group considers both programs, as applicable. Second- or
Third-Class cadets who meet the requirements and are in good standing may apply to CSSAP,
and participate during either their second class or first class year. Board members should
consider cadets’ capacity to succeed in the less-structured environment of a civilian university.
Cadets must be even more mature, self-disciplined, and culturally adaptable than those selected
for CSEAP.
7.4. Cadet Responsibilities:
38                                                           USAFAI16-101 24 APRIL 2012


  7.4.1. Cadets selected for semester study abroad must follow the preparatory guidelines
  detailed in the USAFA Curriculum Handbook. OSI will provide general security briefings to
  all travelers, and will provide regionally focused or country specific briefs, as appropriate.
  7.4.2. A Cadet-in-Charge (CIC) will be selected by the DFIP program manager to lead
  USAFA’s contingent for each semester study abroad trip. The CIC:
     7.4.2.1. Supervises the contingent while on semester study abroad.
     7.4.2.2. Establishes and maintains communication with DFIP and local US Embassy,
     apprises both of all relevant issues as soon as they arise.
     7.4.2.3. Provides USAFA/DFIP a weekly status report via e-mail unless more frequent
     reporting is warranted.
     7.4.2.4. After Action Report (AAR). This report highlights recommendations addressing
     academics, logistics, location, security, vendor(s) used, financial, and suggestions for
     improvement. Include in the AAR photos with captions, an assessment of the
     educational program and of accomplishment of the program goals, statements of cultural
     learning and the impact of the experience on the cadets, both professionally and
     personally. Promptly submit the after action report. The AAR will be retained one
     semester, and may be retained longer if determined useful by the program manager or
     Director DFIP.
  7.4.3. After selection notification, DFIP study abroad program manager will provide cadets
  guidance regarding requirements for official photos, passports, visas, biographies,
  international driver’s licenses, civilian clothing requirements, graduation physicals, credit
  cards, gifts to host families, AFSC selection forms, Graduate Scholarship Office
  coordination, pay & entitlements briefing, summer period preparatory coursework, change of
  address forms (post office), TDY orders, immunizations, medical & dental records, personnel
  records, after action reports, and periodic reporting requirements.
  7.4.4. Culture Education. As directed by DFIP, cadets on selected programs will participate
  in pre- and/or post-immersion cultural education seminars, periodic assignments during the
  immersion, and culture-learning assessment measures, before and after travel.
  7.4.5. USAFA cadets who successfully complete the study abroad program will receive
  academic credit commensurate with academic coursework completed. Academic advisors
  will work with their cadets to create a plan for coursework prior to departure and a plan for
  academic credit transfer. Per Curriculum Handbook 6-1.c.(2)(c), transfer credit is only
  available with prior department approval. DFIP will make available any course catalogs or
  course descriptions from the international institution. The advisor and cadet will
  communicate the course enrollment and credit transfer plan to DFIP, update the plan during
  program execution, and submit a final recommendation upon program completion to the
  DFIP program manager.           DFIP will consolidate and review the course credit
  recommendations and forward a request to the Registrar for course credit. This credit request
  may include credit for any foreign language courses taken and FAS 495 for the cadets’
  experiential learning and successful completion of DFIP’s culture education curriculum.

   7.4.6. Cadet participants may maintain relaxed grooming standards to include hairstyles that
   may touch the ears for men, but will be neat in appearance and not faddish. No facial hair
   will be permitted.
   7.4.7. At the program beginning and end, cadets must notify both DFIP and their AOCs of
   their departure from and return to USAFA. During the semester, cadets may travel within
   the country during weekends or vacation periods when their presence is not required or
   expected for academic or other duties. Cadets must request DFIP approval for any travel

               CADET SUMMER LANGUAGE IMMERSION PROGRAMS

8.1. Program Overview: Foreign language skills are rapidly improved through participation in
an intense, three- to six-week language immersion program. The Cadet Summer Language
Immersion Program (CSLIP) offers 60 hours of structured language instruction led by qualified
instructors for each three-week program (normally 20 hours per week) and 120 hours of
instruction for each six-week program. Any exceptions to this requirement must be approved by
the Director, DFIP and the Head, Foreign Languages Department. Each student who participates
fully and satisfactorily will receive course credit as stipulated in the Curriculum Handbook.
Typically, during the program, cadets commit to speaking only the target language in class, on
cultural excursions, with local business people, and with their host family. Cadets generally
spend half of each day in a classroom environment learning new foreign language skills, and the
rest of the day immersed in the foreign culture, practicing the language. Goals of the program
include the following:
   8.1.1. To develop cadets’ language skills through as complete a linguistic immersion as
   possible.
   8.1.2. To foster a deeper understanding of a specific foreign culture and to awaken in
   students a greater connection to the importance of culture general, including ways in which
   culture can affect military operations across the spectrum.
   8.1.3. To promote professional development that may serve the United States and our allies
   in the years to come.
   8.1.4. To enhance faculty/staff professional development.
8.2. Accountability. During the execution of international education programs, cadets report to
DFIP. If leave is taken before or after an international education program, cadets will report to
their AY or summer program AOCs for command and control functions pursuant to leave status.
Cadets must report in and out with their AOCs and DFIP prior to and immediately following
program execution to ensure proper accountability. All USAFA/DFIP-sponsored programs
begin and end at USAFA or a local area airport. Any exceptions must be coordinated by each
cadet’s AOC and approved by the Director of DFIP or designated representative. For example,
when a program starts during a leave period and a cadet has departed USAFA, the cadet must
return to USAFA or a local area airport before beginning TDY travel or else secure coordination
and approval for an exception. This is also true if a cadet wishes to take leave en route prior to
returning to USAFA from a DFIP-sponsored international activity.
8.3. Participants & Areas of Focus: Each summer, approximately 250+ USAFA cadets, and
select USAFA faculty escorts participate in 3-week or 6-week immersion programs.
Participation in these programs may be opened to a smaller number of AFROTC cadets.
Programs are conducted for Arabic, Chinese (Mandarin), French, German, Japanese, Portuguese,
Russian, and Spanish. In developing language immersion programs overseas or in the US,
USAFA/DFF and DFIP coordinators consider the following criteria: quality of academic
instruction, cadet lodging, with preference granted to programs offering well-managed home
stays with families from the host culture, cultural programs and their integration into the
academic lessons, the setting of the school (safety, cultural interest, relative numbers of tourists),
 42                                                             USAFAI16-101 24 APRIL 2012


and budget. The programs usually begin immediately after spring semester graduation, lasting
until the end of first or second summer period. First-class cadets participating in the 6-week
immersion generally must do so in lieu of leave. CW cadet manning considerations may require
junior cadets to forfeit their leave in order to participate in a three-week immersion.
8.4. Application and Selection Processes.
   8.4.1. Cadet Application and Selection: Interested cadets should apply via DFIP’s on-line
   application, which is sent to eligible cadets in the fall semester. Cadets must have minimum
   cumulative GPA and MPA of 2.2 and be cadets in good standing. Cadets may not be on
   probation of any kind at the time of participation in the program. DFIP screens cadet
   applicants for the various language immersion programs. USAFA/DFF convenes a panel
   with the participation of a DFIP member to review and prioritize USAFA cadet applications,
   and recommends the selections to the program manager in DFIP. The Vice Dean may
   approve waivers for cadet eligibility on an exceptional basis. The Vice Dean may delegate
   this authority to the Director, DFIP. After review, DFIP submits the names to the Vice Dean
   of the Faculty and Vice Commandant of Cadets, who approve the selectees. Cadets are
   notified of their selection/non-selection prior to the winter break, and DFIP provides
   instructions on how to apply for necessary passports, visas, etc. International cadets are not
   eligible for this program.
   8.4.2. Officer Escort Application & Selection and Project Execution: Interested faculty
   and staff members complete DFIP’s application to become escorts in the Cadet Summer
   Language Immersion Program. In the fall semester, DFIP sends all eligible academy
   personnel an e-mail that contains a link to the application. Potential escorts are responsible
   for both completing the application and for securing endorsement or approval by their
   department head, group commander or agency head. USAFA/DFF language executors
   review and prioritize USAFA faculty and staff applications, and recommend the selections to
   the DFIP program manager. DFIP confirms or adjusts the recommendations and notifies
   escorts of their selection/non-selection. Escort officers will plan and execute cultural
   education activities prior to the program, each week while on language immersion, creating
   opportunities for cadets to meaningfully engage with the local culture and use the target
   language, and following the immersion program. To the maximum extent possible, escort
   officers will ensure that classroom instruction prepares cadets for these cultural activities and
   follows up from their experiences to integrate cultural learning and academics.
8.5. Responsibilities:
   8.5.1. DFIP. The Office of International Programs manages and administers the program in
   coordination with SAF/IA guidance and provides specific administrative and informational
   support to include the following:

     program to include checklists and informational briefings. Communicate the requirement
     for 60 hours of structured language instruction for each three weeks of the program (120
     hours for each six-week program), to each language executor and escort officer. Forward
     any requests for exception to this policy to the Director, DFIP and Head, Department of
     Foreign Languages.
     8.5.1.5. Official passports. Assist with the application process for official passports as
     required. For travel requiring tourist passports, individual travelers must obtain and pay
     for these personal identification documents.

     Foreign Clearance Guide.
     8.5.1.9. Public Health and Immunizations. Coordinate with Public Health and escorts to
     set up mandatory briefings concerning regional health concerns. Immunizations may be
     arranged during mandatory pre-deployment style processing lines, or individually by the
     escort and cadet team.
     8.5.1.10. Security. Coordinate with the local OSI detachment and escorts to set up
     mandatory security briefings. Establish risk management plans and communicate these
     to escorts and cadets.        Risk management plans will include force protection
     recommendations and the requirement for escorts to confirm safe arrival and return, as
     well as to report the following concerns as soon as it is safe to do so: death or serious
     injury, minor injury or illness requiring medical attention, a missing cadet, involvement
     of foreign authorities such as the detention of a cadet, and any significant discipline
     issues. These instructions must be provided to every escort prior to departure, and every
     escort and cadet will be furnished a card with contact info for DFIP and the cadet
     command post. The cards will include email addresses and one or more telephone
     numbers for text or voice that will be monitored 24-hours/day.

  effort may include recommending allocation of cadet opportunities by geographic region and
  distribution of 3- and 6-week immersion programs, within budgetary and other constraints,
  and managing the cadet evaluation process IAW the timeline established by DFIP. The
  escort officer has oversight of the planning and execution of their particular program based
  on the approved proposal and authorized budget, in accordance with the guidance in the
  program overview, above. Any significant changes to the program, budget, or cadet team
  composition must be coordinated with DFIP in a timely manner. Escorts must coordinate
  any exception to the requirement for 60 hours of structured language education content at the
  host language school through the DFIP program manager, for approval by the Director, DFIP
  and the Head, DFF. Escorts will ensure their group meets all deadlines and attends all
  mandatory functions related to their program. Responsibilities include:
     8.5.2.1. Cadet Selection. Language executors will convene selection panels of at least 3
     members, including one member from DFIP. Panels select cadets in coordination with
     AOCs and academic advisors. Cadets must be in good standing to participate. Require
     cadets to notify you and notify DFIP if they are placed on probation of any kind before
     travel. Final selection of cadets will be coordinated with and approved by DFIP. DFIP
     will decide, based on the risk factors that escorts, AOCs and academic advisors identify,
     whether to make financial commitments for cadets who anticipate their probations being
     lifted prior to travel.
     8.5.2.2. Escorts complete and submit an acceptance package provided by DFIP, to
     include the alcohol policy for the trip, a Pre-Trip Program Questionnaire, and an
     acknowledgement of escort duties. Each escort must develop an alcohol policy specific
     to their program. IAW AFCWMAN 36-3501, cadets under the age of 21 will not be
     allowed to consume alcohol at any time. Cadets 21 years of age or older may consume
     alcohol responsibly and in accordance with the guidelines established by DFIP and the
     escort officer. The escort officer may institute an alcohol policy more restrictive than the
     AFCWMAN 36-3501. Escorts must sign a form indicating that they will execute the
     program in accordance with all guidelines and policies as communicated by DFIP; meet
     all deadlines; keep their program within the approved budget; submit a final budget and
USAFAI16-101 24 APRIL 2012                                                                     45


     trip report after completion of the program; and, with cadets, submit the required
     assessment product associated with the program.
     8.5.2.3. Escorts will review and comply with all current requirements in the Foreign
     Clearance Guide (FCG), https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil and all timely updates,
     including obtaining the required type of passports and visas. For regions where US
     authorities require Individual Anti-Terrorism Plans (IATPs), escorts will submit these
     plans. US authorities in various countries can and do change the requirements and the
     enforcement of the requirements. Deviation from any requirement in the FCG requires
     written approval from the sitting air attaché, defense attaché or higher authority in the US
     embassy.
     8.5.2.4. Budgeting and Accounting. Language executor recommends overall allocation
     of budget for languages that support more than one location. Escort maintains an updated
     budget and communicates with the program manager throughout the planning, execution,
     and follow-up process. Consider airfare, lodging, per diem for meals and incidental
     expenses, tuition, cost of cultural activities, ground transportation, visa fees, etc. in
     developing the budget. Make potential cadets aware of financial plans and warn them of
     anticipated out-of-pocket expenses. Charitable donations must come from personal funds
     and may not be paid from appropriated program monies. Remain aware of approved
     budget and expenditures throughout planning and execution. Track payments as they are
     made, and report those to DFIP as you refine the plan and through the vouchers and
     reports.
     8.5.2.5. Immersion Arrangements. Contract with language school in the region,
     considering quality of academic instruction, well-managed home stay or other safe living
     arrangement, cultural excursions, the location of the school in regards to the level of
     tourism, safety, and cost. Make travel arrangements to and from the foreign destination
     through the Contract Travel Office (CTO). Initiate group travel arrangements through
     DTS, as DTS is linked to the CTO. If the travel will require use of a rental car driven by
     USAFA travelers, book that through the CTO and use a government-issued credit card to
     make the purchase. CTO may also assist with lodging and air or ground transportation
     arrangements within the region if the escort requests this assistance. For cultural
     activities, lodging and transportation within the region, compare programs and prices
     from two or more sources and choose the best value.
     8.5.2.6. Payment to Vendors. Work with DFIP to determine the best method to pay for
     programs within the region. Payments may be made in advance using the DFIP
     Corporate Travel Card or by the travelers in-country.
     8.5.2.7. Passport and Visa Requirements. Ensure your group obtains the appropriate
     passport and visas, with DFIP support. If the Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG) requires
     official passports, but the Air Attaché, Defense Attaché, or Chargé d’Affaires at the US
     Embassy in country specifically allows, in writing or email, travel on tourist passports for
     a particular trip, then the escort for that specific trip may request DFIP approval to travel
     on tourist passports. All travelers in an entire group must travel on the same type of
     passport. In cases where official passports are required, escorts must plan well in
     advance to meet the necessary lead time.

     https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil.
     8.5.2.9. Scheduling Committee Action (SCA). When travel will require cadets to miss
     class or other required events, escorts will submit an SCA. In these cases, cadets may
     need to meet a higher GPA requirement, as stipulated by the Vice Dean or Director DFIP.
     8.5.2.10. Travel Authorizations (Orders) and pre-travel requirements. Escorts will

     execution. Escorts will ensure that cadets and group members adhere to all standards and
     rules throughout the duration of travel. Traveling with family members or anyone
     external to the escort and cadet cohort is discouraged, and any plans to do so must be
     approved in advance by the Director DFIP.
     8.5.2.13. USAFA cadets who successfully complete the program will receive academic
     credit for FAS 400 or FAS 401. The language executors, appointed by the DFF division
     chiefs, will consolidate and review Foreign Area Studies (FAS) course credit
     recommendations from each faculty escort and forward a request to the Advisor in
     Charge (AIC). The FAS AIC will compile course credit recommendations from each
     language and forward those to the Registrar for course credit. To earn FAS 400 credit,
     cadets must successfully complete all requirements specified in the Curriculum
     Handbook, and, if offered for their program, DFIP’s culture education curriculum.

     departure from and return to USAFA at the program beginning and end. This may occur
     as part of the normally scheduled cadet transition guidelines during the return from
     various break periods and the transition from one summer training period to another.
     Before and after the program, cadets report to their AY AOC or training program AOC as
     appropriate. During the international education program, cadets report to their escort and
     DFIP. CICs or escorts are to notify DFIP within 24 hours of arrival in country and
     immediately upon return to USAFA. During travel, cadets will follow all orders,
     directions and instructions given by the escort.
     8.5.3.6. Cadet participants may maintain relaxed grooming standards to include
     hairstyles that may touch the ears for men, but will be neat in appearance and not faddish.
     No facial hair will be permitted.
     8.5.3.7. Cadets may travel within the country at their own expense on weekends when
     their presence is not required for academic or other duties. Cadets will observe all force

                       CADET CULTURE IMMERSION PROGRAM

9.1. Program Overview. The USAFA Cadet Culture Immersion Program provides cadets the
opportunity to experience a foreign culture first hand. Escorts and cadets plan and execute
programs one to three weeks in duration. Each cultural immersion takes place in one or more
foreign countries where English is not the primary or official language. Goals of the program
include the following:
   9.1.1. To develop cadets’ cross-cultural competency by building their understanding of a
   specific culture and awakening in them a greater connection to the importance of culture
   general, including ways in which culture can affect military operations across the spectrum.
   9.1.2. To foster language skills through this immersion program.
   9.1.3. To promote professional development that may serve the United States and our allies
   in the years to come.
   9.1.4. To enhance faculty/staff professional development.
9.2. Accountability. During the execution of international education programs, cadets report to
DFIP. If leave is taken before or after an international education program, cadets will report to
their AY or summer program AOCs for command and control functions pursuant to leave status.
Cadets must report in and out with their AOCs and DFIP prior to and immediately following
program execution to ensure proper accountability. All USAFA/DFIP-sponsored programs
begin and end at USAFA or a local area airport. Any exceptions must be coordinated by each
cadet’s AOC and approved by the Director of DFIP or designated representative. For example,
when a program starts during a leave period and a cadet has departed USAFA, the cadet must
return to USAFA or a local area airport before beginning TDY travel or else secure coordination
and approval for an exception. This is also true if a cadet wishes to take leave en route prior to
returning to USAFA from a DFIP-sponsored international activity.
9.3. Proposal and Selection Process.
   9.3.1. DFIP issues a call for proposals as part of the annual announcement of international
   programs in the fall semester. All are located on a separate page of the DFIP SharePoint
   Site.
       9.3.1.1. Proposals. Instructions for proposal submission will be provided.
       9.3.1.2. The deadline for proposal submission will be included in the announcement.
       9.3.1.3. Proposals for travel during spring break or any of the three summer periods will
       receive top priority. Proposals for travel during winter break may be submitted and will
       receive secondary consideration.
   9.3.2. Proposal Selection Process. The selection process will be completed by DFIP in
   conjunction with the respective Area Studies Groups.
       9.3.2.1. Area Studies Groups will convene boards to evaluate each proposal. Boards are
       to include a member from DFIP, and will pass their recommendations to the DFIP
50                                                           USAFAI16-101 24 APRIL 2012


     program manager. Director DFIP will review recommendations and select programs for
     final approval.
     9.3.2.2. Selection Criteria. Proposals will be reviewed and prioritized for approval based
     on the criteria below:
        9.3.2.2.1. Program educational objective and its contribution to the development of
        cross-cultural competency. Immersion programs with an academic, thematic
        approach will result in stronger learning opportunities. The itinerary should support
        the stated objectives.
        9.3.2.2.2. Strategic importance of region to be visited. DFIP ensures that the
        distribution of immersion programs around the world is balanced with DoD and AF
        objectives.
        9.3.2.2.3. Language component of the proposed program. A language speaking or
        learning component should be considered during planning actions, as they provide
        added value. All programs take place in regions where English is not the primary
        language.
        9.3.2.2.4. Overall cost and accuracy of budget. All foreseeable and standard costs
        should be included in the proposal.
        9.3.2.2.5. Past experience/background of proposing escort officer and cadets.
        Successful past experience with DFIP programs will be considered favorably.
        However, as faculty development is an objective of the program, escorts without
        previous DFIP experience will receive fair consideration. In these cases, escorts are
        encouraged to highlight operational or other leadership experience that might reliably
        indicate the potential for success.
     9.3.2.3. Once proposals are approved and prioritized for funding by Director, DFIP, the
     annual program will be provided to the IPC.
     9.3.2.4. DFIP will notify all escorts of the status of their proposal once the IPC has been
     notified. DFIP will send a blank acceptance package to those escorts whose proposals
     are selected. Escorts must submit a completed acceptance package to include the
     following:
        9.3.2.4.1. An assessment plan which indicates the primary objectives of the program,
        how the itinerary will meet those objectives, and how those objectives will be tracked
        throughout the program and in the final assessment product to be submitted after
        completion of the program.
        9.3.2.4.2. Alcohol Policy. Each escort must develop an alcohol policy specific to
        their program. IAW AFCWMAN 36-3501, cadets under the age of 21 will not be
        allowed to consume alcohol at any time. Cadets 21 years of age or older may
        consume alcohol responsibly and in accordance with the guidelines established by
        DFIP and the escort officer. The escort officer may institute an alcohol policy more
        restrictive than AFCWMAN 36-3501. If deemed appropriate, DFIP may submit a
        package to DF and CW requesting permission for alcohol consumption by cadets
        while on an SCA.
USAFAI16-101 24 APRIL 2012                                                                       51


           9.3.2.4.3. Cadet Selection. The Acceptance Plan must indicate how the escort will
           select cadets for the program in a manner that supports the immersion objectives.
           Cadets must be in good standing, with a minimum GPA of 2.2, to participate. If the
           travel dates require cadets to miss class, then a higher academic standard may be
           established. Escorts may submit waivers for cadet eligibility to DFIP through the
           program manager. The Vice Dean may approve waivers for cadet eligibility on an
           exceptional basis. The Vice Dean may delegate this authority to the Director, DFIP.
           Cadets who have not previously traveled with DFIP will receive higher consideration
           than their peers who have already benefitted from DFIP travel. DFIP must approve
           cadet selection, and reserves the right to adjust cadet rosters for each program in order
           to offer opportunities across the Cadet Wing. Cadets may participate in Cultural
           Immersion programs no earlier than the beginning of their 3rd class summer
           programs/end of 4th class academic year, unless specifically excepted by director,
           DFIP. Although cadets may help develop cultural immersion proposals, this program
           is NOT intended to provide funding for travel by groups of cadet friends. Escorts and
           DFIP are solely responsible for composing each group of cadet travelers.
           9.3.2.4.4. Acceptance Package, Acknowledging Responsibilities. Escorts must sign
           a checklist indicating that they will execute the program in accordance with all
           guidelines and policies as communicated by DFIP; meet all deadlines; keep their
           program within the approved budget; submit a final budget and trip report after
           completion of the program; and, with cadets, submit the required assessment product
           associated with the program.

     and in the acceptance package. Cadets should be identified in coordination with Area
     Studies Groups, whenever possible. Final selection of cadets will be coordinated with
     and approved by DFIP. Cadets must be in good standing to participate. Require cadets
     to notify you and notify DFIP if they are placed on probation of any kind. DFIP will
     decide, based on the risk factors escorts, AOCs and academic advisors identify, whether
     to make financial commitments for cadets who anticipate their probations being lifted
     prior to travel.
     9.4.2.3. Review and comply with all current requirements in the Foreign Clearance
     Guide (FCG), https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil, and all timely updates, including
     obtaining the required type of passports and visas. Relying on experience from a
     previous year is not sufficient. US authorities in various countries can and do change the
     requirements and the enforcement of the requirements. Deviation from any requirement
     in the FCG requires written approval from the sitting Air attaché, Defense Attaché or
     higher authority in the US embassy.
     9.4.2.4. Budgeting and Accounting. Maintain an updated budget throughout the
     planning and execution process. Consider airfare, lodging, per diem for meals and
     incidental expenses, cost of cultural activities, visa fees, etc. in developing the proposal.
     Proportional per diem may be authorized, as opposed to full per diem, as a cost saving
     measure. Make potential cadets aware of financial plans and warn them of anticipated
     out of pocket expenses. Any charitable donations must come from personal funds and
     not appropriated program monies. Remain aware of approved budget and expenditures
     throughout planning and execution. Track payments as they are made, and report those
     to DFIP as you refine the plan and through the vouchers and reports.
     9.4.2.5. Travel Arrangements. Arrange to purchase airline or other transportation tickets,
     lodging reservations, and plan the immersion activities. Make travel arrangements to and
     from the foreign destination through the Contract Travel Office (CTO). Initiate group
     travel arrangements through DTS, as DTS is linked to the CTO. If the travel will require
     use of a rental car driven by USAFA travelers, book that through the CTO and use a
     government-issued credit card to make the purchase. CTO may also assist with lodging
54                                                             USAFAI16-101 24 APRIL 2012


     and air or ground transportation arrangements within the region if the escort requests this
     assistance. For cultural activities, lodging and transportation within the region, compare
     programs and prices from two or more sources and choose the best value.
     9.4.2.6. Payment to Vendors. Work with DFIP to determine the best method to pay for
     programs. Payments may be made in advance using the DFIP Corporate Travel Card or
     by the travelers in-country.
     9.4.2.7. Passport and Visa Requirements. Ensure your group obtains the appropriate
     passport and visas, with DFIP support. If the Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG),
     https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil, requires official passports, but the Air Attaché, Defense
     Attaché, or Chargé d’Affaires at the US Embassy in country specifically allows, in
     writing (or email), travel on tourist passports for a particular trip, then the escort for that
     specific trip may request DFIP approval to travel on tourist passports. All travelers in an
     entire group must travel on the same type of passport. In cases where official passports
     are required, escorts must plan well in advance to meet the necessary lead time.
     9.4.2.8. Country Clearance Request. Escorts will submit the Country Clearance request
     through the Aircraft and Personnel Automated Clearance System (APACS),
     https://apacs.dtic.mil/apacs/,     in      accordance       with      the       FCG,
     https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil.
     9.4.2.9. Scheduling Committee Action (SCA). When travel or pre-travel obligations will
     require cadets to miss class or other required events, escorts will submit an SCA. In these
     cases, cadets may need to meet a higher GPA requirement than the minimum. Escorts
     will seek guidance from the program manager, as appropriate.
     9.4.2.10. Travel Authorizations (Orders) and pre-travel requirements. Escorts will
     ensure they and all cadets submit travel authorizations through DTS prior to travel.
     Escorts must determine, based on budget and program requirements, the appropriate per
     diem and reimbursements. Escorts must ensure that they and each cadet receive a region-
     specific medical briefing, all required immunizations, Isolated Personnel Report
     (ISOPREP) or Civilian Personnel Data Verification (CIVDATVER) and a security
     briefing from the Office of Special Investigations (OSI), and satisfy other requirements as
     identified by DFIP. Program manager advises escorts with these tasks.
     9.4.2.11. Culture Education. Selected escorts will ensure participation of each cadet in
     any pre- and post-immersion cultural education seminars, and will ensure completion of
     culture-learning assessment measures, before and after travel, as directed by DFIP.
     Escort roles in the seminars may take the form of either leadership or participation.
     9.4.2.12. Accountability. Escorts will maintain positive control and accountability of
     their group throughout the duration of the program. Escorts will report to DFIP within 24
     hours of arrival in country and also upon return to the US, and will report any significant
     concerns as identified by the DFIP risk management plan that may arise during program
     execution. Escorts will ensure that cadets and group members adhere to all standards and
     rules throughout the duration of travel. Traveling with family members or anyone
     external to the escort and cadet cohort is discouraged, and any plans to do so must be
     approved in advance by the Director DFIP.
USAFAI16-101 24 APRIL 2012                                                                      55


     9.4.2.13. Post-Trip Actions. The escort will coordinate or submit the following vouchers
     and final report:
         9.4.2.13.1. Travel Vouchers. Escorts will ensure that all travelers promptly submit
         travel vouchers through DTS.
         9.4.2.13.2. After Action Report (AAR). This report highlights recommendations
         addressing academics, logistics, location, security, vendor(s) used, financial, and
         suggestions for improvement. Include in the AAR photos with captions, an
         assessment of the educational program and of accomplishment of the program goals,
         statements of cultural learning and the impact of the experience on the cadets, both
         professionally and personally. Promptly submit the after action report. The AAR
         will be retained one semester, and may be retained longer if determined useful by the
         program manager or Director DFIP.
  9.4.3. Cadets. Under the direction of their escort officer and DFIP cadets are required to:
     9.4.3.1. Meet all minimum requirements and remain in good standing in order to
     participate. Notify their escort and DFIP if they are placed on probation of any type at
     any time prior to departure. To miss any scheduled classes, cadets will require an SCA
     and may have to meet a higher academic standard.
     9.4.3.2. Complete all tasks by set deadlines and attend mandatory briefings and
     appointments. These may include training requirements, medical appointments, security
     and informational briefings, and culture education.
     9.4.3.3. Obtain necessary travel documents to include passports, visas and travel orders,
     and ISOPREP. Attend scheduled medical and OSI briefings and obtain required
     immunizations.
     9.4.3.4. Culture Education. Cadets on selected programs will participate in pre- and/or
     post-immersion cultural education seminars, and will complete culture learning
     assessment measures, before and after travel, as directed by DFIP.
     9.4.3.5. Accountability. Cadets must notify their AY or summer program AOCs of their
     departure from and return to USAFA at the program beginning and end. This may occur
     as part of the normally scheduled cadet transition guidelines during the return from
     various break periods and the transition from one summer training period to another.
     Before and after the program, cadets report to their AY AOC or training program AOC as
     appropriate. During the international education program, cadets report to their escort and
     DFIP. CICs or escorts are to notify DFIP within 24 hours of arrival in country and
     immediately upon return to USAFA. During travel, cadets will follow all orders,
     directions and instructions given by the escort.
     9.4.3.6. Cadet participants will maintain relaxed grooming standards to include hairstyles
     that may touch the ears for men, but will be neat in appearance and not faddish. No facial
     hair will be permitted.
     9.4.3.7. Post-Trip Actions. Cadets will assist the escort(s) in completing all post-trip
     actions to include:
         9.4.3.7.1. Travel Vouchers. Cadets will promptly submit travel vouchers through
         DTS.
56                                                            USAFAI16-101 24 APRIL 2012


         9.4.3.7.2. Assessment. As directed, cadets will provide escorts with cultural learning
         reflections and assessments, lessons learned to improve future immersion
         opportunities, and any other assessment products.
  9.4.4. Area Studies Groups (ASG). Regional Area Studies Groups will assist with the
  Culture and Language Immersion Program as follows:
     9.4.4.1. Proposal Submission. Each ASG is encouraged to coordinate proposals for their
     area of expertise and linked to the strategic goals stated by the relevant Combatant
     Command. ASGs are encouraged to work closely with COCOM and US Embassy/DAO
     contacts to propose programs in line with such goals.
     9.4.4.2. Proposal Review. Members of the ASGs will sit on review and selection boards
     for proposals. To avoid conflict of interest, members who have submitted proposals
     should not evaluate proposals, or at least should recuse themselves from evaluating their
     own. Recommendations from ASGs should consider the selection criteria detailed above
     and include rank-ordered proposals to the region and justification for this ranking.
     9.4.4.3. Area Expertise. ASGs will provide area expertise to DFIP and escorts as
     needed. ASG members will support culture education relating to their region of
     specialty.
     9.4.4.4. Cadet Selection. ASGs will help identify and recommend to DFIP cadets
     qualified to participate in specific programs related to their area.
  9.4.5. 10 LGRDDO (Vehicle Operations). For groups of 10 or more, Vehicle Operations
  will provide transportation to and from local airports for language and culture travel. All
  others must arrange cost-effective ground transportation and claim reimbursement on their
  travel voucher.
  9.4.6. 10 MDG/SGPM (Public Health). Public Health will provide area regionally specific
  health briefings to each group; will assist with setting up immunizations; and will assist with
  ensuring cadets are medically qualified and complete all required medical visits.
  9.4.7. Office of Special Investigations (OSI). OSI will provide general security briefings to
  all travelers, and will provide regionally focused or country specific briefs as appropriate.
  9.4.8. USAFA/CWT. Cadet Wing Training Support will assist in scheduling             cadets for
  summer programs and provide Isolated Personnel Report (ISOPREP) support.            DFIP will
  make every effort to identify cadets selected for summer programs ahead of          the CWT
  deadline for summer requirements. DFIP will coordinate cadet schedules for          ISOPREP
  appointments.
USAFAI16-101 24 APRIL 2012                                                                     57


                                          Chapter 10

                      INTERNATIONAL WEEK AND RECIPROCAL

10.1. Program Overview. USAFA hosts the visits of international cadets and officers during
International Week and Colombia Week events, typically held each October and April. For
International Week each foreign delegation consists of four cadets and one escort officer. For
Colombian Week, the Colombian Air Force Academy traditionally sends its graduating class on
a trip to the United States each year. Foreign Academy Visits are reciprocal programs that
promote bonds of understanding between forces. These visits are coordinated through the
Defense Attaché Office. Delegations of cadets and escorts that participate in this program are
the primary host during the reciprocal visit during fall/spring International Weeks. The purposes
of the visits, for both USAFA and foreign academies, are:
   10.1.1. To develop cadets’ understanding of specific cultures and to awaken in them a
   greater connection to the importance of culture general, including ways in which culture can
   affect military operations across the spectrum.
   10.1.2. To promote professional relationships that may serve the United States and our allies
   in the years to come.
   10.1.3. To foster language skills through this reciprocal immersion program.
   10.1.4. To enhance faculty/staff professional development.
10.2. Accountability. During the execution of foreign academy visit programs, cadets report to
DFIP. If leave is taken before or after an international education program, cadets will report to
their AY or summer program AOCs for command and control functions pursuant to leave status.
Cadets must report in and out with their AOCs and DFIP prior to and immediately following
program execution to ensure proper accountability. All USAFA/DFIP-sponsored programs
begin and end at USAFA or a local area airport. Any exceptions must be coordinated by each
cadet’s AOC and approved by the Director of DFIP or designated representative. For example,
when a program starts during a leave period and a cadet has departed USAFA, the cadet must
return to USAFA or a local area airport before beginning TDY travel or else secure coordination
and approval for an exception. This is also true if a cadet wishes to take leave en route prior to
returning to USAFA from a DFIP-sponsored international activity.
10.3. Application Processes:
   10.3.1. Cadet Applications. Cadets submit DFIP’s On-line Application to Participate in the
   Cadet Foreign Academy Reciprocal Visits Program. In the fall semester, DFIP will send
   cadets an e-mail that will include a link to the on-line application. Cadets will secure the
   endorsement of their AOC to participate.
       10.3.1.1. Cadets must be in good standing in order to participate and have earned both a
       GPA and MPA of at least 2.2. Program manager may apply a higher standard, especially
       for MPA, as the selected cadets will represent USAFA in a military-to-military contact.
       If the travel dates require cadets to miss class, then a higher academic standard than the
       minimum may be established. If cadets do not meet these standards, escorts may submit
       waiver requests for cadet eligibility to DFIP through the program manager. The Vice
       Dean may approve waivers for cadet eligibility in coordination with DFIP and the cadet’s
 58                                                             USAFAI16-101 24 APRIL 2012


       AOC and academic advisor, on an exceptional basis. The Vice Dean may delegate this
       authority to the Director, DFIP. Cadets who have not previously traveled with DFIP will
       receive favorable consideration. DFIP establishes or approves cadet rosters, and reserves
       the right to adjust cadet rosters for each program in order to offer opportunities across the
       Cadet Wing. Fourth-class cadets may not participate in the program. Rising 3-degrees
       may be considered for summer travel.
       10.3.1.2. All cadets except four-degrees, regardless of academic major or minor, are
       encouraged to apply.
       10.3.1.3. As a general rule, cadets may participate in only one Foreign Academy
       Reciprocal Visit during their four years at USAFA.
   10.3.2. Officer Escort Application Process:
       10.3.2.1. Interested faculty and staff members complete DFIP’s application to become
       escorts in the Cadet Foreign Academy Reciprocal Visits Program. In the fall semester,
       Academy personnel will receive an e-mail that contains a link to the application.
       Prospective escorts must secure the endorsement of their department head, group
       commander or agency head. Application to participate is indication of this endorsement.
   10.3.2.2. All USAFA faculty and staff are encouraged to apply. Priority of selection of
   escort officers for foreign academy visits will go to AOCs, faculty and staff members with a
   demonstrated specialty or interest in the region and who can maximize the benefits of the
   experience for the cadets. To escort foreign academy visits, priority will be given to
   uniformed military officers.
       10.3.2.3. Escort officers must be willing to support DFIP-sponsored events such as
       International Week or Colombia Week depending on availability and should review host
       officer responsibilities in section 10.6. before applying or accepting responsibility for
       escorting a program to a foreign academy.
10.4. Selection Process:
   10.4.1. In the fall semester, DFIP publicizes the opportunity for cadets and officers to
   represent USAFA on foreign academy visits and invites prospective cadets and escorts to
   apply.
   10.4.2. Interested cadets and officers submit applications for participation to USAFA/DFIP,
   in coordination with AOCs and academic advisors or department heads (or equivalent) for
   permanent party member escorts. The due date will be identified in the announcement.
   Cadets must be in good standing to participate, and are required to notify their escort and
   DFIP if they are placed on probation of any kind. DFIP will decide, based on the risk factors
   escorts, AOCs and academic advisors identify, whether to make financial commitments for
   cadets who anticipate their probations being lifted prior to travel.
   10.4.3. During the fall semester, the USAFA/DFIP program manager for Foreign Academy
   Visits identifies primary and alternate cadet and officer escort candidates for each foreign
   academy visit.
   10.4.4. Before the end of the fall semester, pending DFV and CWV approval, USAFA/DFIP
   notifies all applicants of their selection or non-selection.
USAFAI16-101 24 APRIL 2012                                                                     59


   10.4.5. Between the time of selection notification and international travel, USAFA/DFIP
   will provide cadet and escort officer selectees (primaries and alternates) a checklist, to
   include the alcohol policy, an outline of responsibilities, and a list of mandatory pre- and
   post-trip required actions. These actions should include requirements for passports, photos,
   biographies, health/immunizations, threat briefings, country clearance, individual anti-
   terrorism plans (if applicable), travel arrangements (air and ground), travel orders, standards
   of conduct, uniforms & clothing requirements, gifts, after-action reports, vouchers, reciprocal
   visit hosting obligations, and other requirements.
10.5. Responsibilities for Sending USAFA Delegations to Foreign Service Academies:
   10.5.1. DFIP. The Office of International Programs manages and administers the FAV
   program and provides specific administrative and informational support to include the
   following:
      10.5.1.1. Announcement. Publicize the program.
      10.5.1.2. Budget and Accounting for the program. Program manager will coordinate
      with resource manager to develop a spend plan and track expenses, gather and validate
      budget and accounting information, and will provide this budget information to the escort
      who will track all expenses.
      10.5.1.3. Official passports. Assist with the application process for official passports as
      required. For travel requiring tourist passports, individual travelers must obtain and pay
      for these personal identification documents.

      through the Aircraft and Personnel Automated Clearance System (APACS),
      https://apacs.dtic.mil/apacs/,    in       accordance        with      the       FCG,
      https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil.
      10.5.1.7. Public Health and Immunizations. Coordinate with Public Health and escorts
      to set up mandatory briefings concerning regional health concerns. Immunizations may
      be arranged during mandatory pre-deployment style processing lines, or individually by
      the escort and cadet team.
      10.5.1.8. Security. Coordinate with the local OSI detachment and escorts to set up
      mandatory security briefings. Establish risk management plans and communicate these
      to escorts and cadets.        Risk management plans will include force protection
      recommendations and the requirement to confirm safe arrival and return, as well as to
      report the following concerns as soon as it is safe to do so: death or serious injury, minor
      injury or illness requiring medical attention, a missing cadet, involvement of foreign
      authorities such as the detention of a cadet, and any significant disciplinary issues. These
      instructions must be provided to every escort prior to departure, and every escort and
      cadet will be furnished a card with contact info for DFIP and the cadet command post.
60                                                          USAFAI16-101 24 APRIL 2012


     The cards will include email addresses and one or more telephone numbers for text or
     voice that will be monitored 24-hours/day.
     10.5.1.9. ISOPREP. Coordinate with the Cadet Wing security manager to arrange
     Isolated Personnel Report Card (ISOPREP) submission appointments and with the Photo
     Lab to allow travelers to obtain ISOPREP photos. Provide an electronic copy of all
     photos to the Cadet Wing security manager. All military travelers, to include cadets,
     must submit an ISOPREP, regardless of their travel destination. Civilian escorts must
     complete the unclassified civilian equivalent, the Civilian Personnel Data Verification
     (CIVDATVER).
     10.5.1.10. Airport Transportation. Coordinate ground transportation to and from local
     airports in Colorado Springs and Denver for groups of sufficient size. Individuals and
     small groups may, on a case by case basis, be reimbursed for airport shuttles or mileage
     parking expenses for a minimum number of vehicles.
     10.5.1.11. Communications. Provide all necessary information to the respective
     agencies and departments as warranted.
     10.5.1.12. If deemed appropriate by the Director, DFIP will submit a package to DF and
     CW requesting permission for alcohol consumption by cadets if traveling on an SCA,
     within the limits prescribed by AFCWMAN 36-3501.
     10.5.1.13. Program Reports. Escort officer will compile all assessment reports and
     present them to DFIP. These will be maintained for one semester or longer if deemed
     appropriate and relevant by the program manager or Director.
  10.5.2. Escort Officers. The escort officer has oversight of the execution of their program.
  Escorts are ultimately responsible to ensure their group meets all deadlines and attends all
  mandatory functions related to their program. Responsibilities include:
     10.5.2.1. Complete and submit a checklist provided by DFIP, to include the alcohol
     policy for the trip, and an acceptance of escort duties. Each escort develops an alcohol
     policy specific to their program. IAW AFCWMAN 36-3501, cadets under the age of 21
     may not consume alcohol at any time. Cadets 21 years of age or older may consume
     alcohol responsibly and in accordance with the guidelines established by DFIP and the
     escort officer. The escort officer may institute an alcohol policy more restrictive than
     AFCWMAN 36-3501. Escorts must sign a form indicating that they will execute the
     program in accordance with all guidelines and policies as communicated by DFIP; submit
     a final trip report after completion of the program; and, with cadets, submit any required
     cultural learning assessment products associated with the program.
     10.5.2.2. Review and comply with all current requirements in the Foreign Clearance
     Guide (FCG), https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil, and all timely updates, including
     obtaining the required type of passports and visas. Relying on experience from a
     previous year is not sufficient. US authorities in various countries can and do change the
     requirements and the enforcement of the requirements. Deviation from any requirement
     in the FCG requires written approval from the sitting air attaché, defense attaché or
     higher authority in the US embassy.
USAFAI16-101 24 APRIL 2012                                                                       61


     10.5.2.3. Budgeting and Accounting. Work with DFIP to maintain an updated spending
     plan throughout the execution process. Make potential cadets aware of financial plans
     and warn them of anticipated out of pocket expenses. Any charitable donations must
     come from personal funds and not appropriated program monies. Track payments as they
     are made, and report those to DFIP during execution, as well as through the travel
     vouchers.
     10.5.2.4. Travel/Lodging Arrangements. Work with DFIP to arrange the purchase of
     airline or other transportation tickets, lodging reservations, and plan the international
     education activities. Make travel arrangements to and from the foreign destination
     through the Contract Travel Office (CTO). Initiate group travel arrangements through
     DTS, as DTS is linked to the CTO. CTO may also assist with lodging and air or ground
     transportation arrangements within the region if the escort requests this assistance. In
     cases where travel dates extend beyond the dates for which the host academy will host
     the USAFA delegation, escort will arrange for lodging, cultural activities, and
     transportation, compare programs and prices from two or more sources and choose the
     best value. If the travel will require use of a rental car driven by USAFA travelers, book
     that through the CTO and use a government-issued credit card to make the purchase.
     10.5.2.5. Payment to Vendors. Work with DFIP to determine the best method to pay for
     programs. Payments may be made in advance using the DFIP Corporate Travel Card or
     by the travelers in-country.
     10.5.2.6. Passport and Visa Requirements. Ensure your group obtains the appropriate
     passport and visas, with DFIP support. If the Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG),

        ACADEMY STAFF FOREIGN MILITARY INTERACTION PROGRAMS

11.1. Program Overview: As a premier undergraduate academic institution and officer training
program, USAFA represents an emulative model for foreign militaries. As a result, USAFA’s
faculty and staff agencies are called upon to assist and advise on the establishment or
modernization of foreign defense academies. Of particular interest to foreign military educators
and administrators is our curriculum’s composition and its integration, character and honor
education, research-oriented education and laboratories, course development in the area of civil-
military relations, balancing academic education with military, athletic, and flying training, and
our policies and procedures on the assimilation of women and gay service members. Long-term
institutional mentoring initiatives, such as USAFA’s partnership with the National Military
Academy of Afghanistan (NMAA), may exceed the scope and manpower capacity of DFIP to
manage. The Military & Strategic Studies Department manages the NMAA partnership.
11.2. Objectives: USAF international policy objectives see international military education and
training as a force multiplier, building influence, interoperability, and encouraging democratic
values. USAFA’s staff assistance to foreign academies garners prestige for the institution, builds
bridges and cooperation between air forces, creates possibilities for future cadet foreign
exchanges, and provides opportunities for faculty and staff development.
11.3. Responsibilities:
   11.3.1. USAFA/DFIP is the primary focal point for USAFA foreign military interaction
   initiatives. The office is responsible for staffing HQ USAFA/CC, SAF/IA, OSD, and State
   Department clearances and visit request approval, and for providing guidance to the USAFA
   mission element or academic department on how to provide institutional support to foreign
   militaries. The notable exception to this general rule is DFMI’s direction of USAFA’s
   support to the National Military Academy of Afghanistan.
   11.3.2. USAFA Department or Agency. The USAFA mission element, agency, laboratory,
   or department that invites, or is most closely associated with the primary area of interest
   identified by the foreign service academy, takes the lead on the visit and coordinate briefings,
   tours, and activities with other mission elements or agencies.
   11.3.3. 10 LRS/LGRDDO: For groups of 10 or more, Vehicle Operations will provide
   transportation to and from local airports for language and culture travel. All others must
   arrange cost-effective ground transportation and claim reimbursement on their travel
   voucher. Vehicle Operations will also provide travel in the local area if such travel complies
   with AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations.
