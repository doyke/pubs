2.8.1. (Added) Hazardous Noise Protection.
2.8.1.1. (Added) Responsibilities.       Squadron commanders and supervisors will ensure
compliance with this instruction.
2.8.1.1.1. (Added) Squadron commanders and supervisors are responsible for notifying
Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) at 6-7521 if hazardous noise producing equipment is used in
the work center that is not listed on the shop BE survey.
2.8.1.1.2. (Added) Individuals are not required to carry double hearing protection at all times on
the flight line. However squadron commanders will ensure adequate hearing protection is
available on the flight line to meet double hearing protection requirements as defined in this
instruction.
2.8.1.1.3. (Added) Supervisors will:
2.8.1.1.3.1. (Added) Ensure that all forms of hearing protection and communication equipment,
to include communication headsets, have been evaluated by BE.
2.8.1.1.3.2. (Added) Ensure future purchases of all forms of hearing protection and
communication equipment, to include communication headsets have a minimum noise reduction
rating (NRR) of 29 decibels. Current hearing protection with less than 29 NRR will be replaced
through attrition. If a 29 NRR cannot be achieved by using single hearing protection, double
hearing protection must be worn in addition to the paragraphs listed in this supplement.
2.8.1.1.4. (Added) Supervisors will instruct users on proper use and care of hearing protection
devices (HPD) in the workplace as part of the annual training program.
2.8.1.2. (Added) Use of Hearing Protection: Personnel entering flight line and backshop
hazardous noise areas will have access to adequate hearing protection, i.e., ear plugs or ear plugs
and ear defenders/headset.
2.8.1.2.1. (Added) The following maintenance personnel hearing protection requirements are
established:
2.8.1.2.1.1. (Added) Aircraft operations.
2.8.1.2.1.1.1. (Added) Single hearing protection with a minimum (NRR) of 29 decibels is
required when within 200 feet of a running F-16 and outside of the wing tip to wing tip, tail to
nose circumference.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_LUKEAFBSUP 24 OCTOBER 2011                                                    3


2.8.1.2.1.1.2. (Added) Double hearing protection will be used when in the immediate vicinity of
an aircraft with engines operating as defined by, within the wing tip to wing tip, tail to nose
circumference. Or when involved in engine operations, (ground maintenance runs, launch and
recovery, redball maintenance, etc.) in the hush house (outside of cab), on the trim pad, and
during End Of Runway (EOR) operations.
2.8.1.2.1.2. (Added) Aerospace Ground Equipment operations.
2.8.1.2.1.2.1. (Added) Single hearing protection with a minimum NRR of 29 decibels is
required when you are within 50 feet of a running Generator (-60) or Hydraulic Test stand (MJ-
2A-1).
2.8.1.2.1.2.2. (Added) All other powered AGE (including munitions jammers) requires single
hearing protection within 25 feet of the operating unit. Exception: MD-4 Electric Generators and
FL-1D Light carts do not require any protection because the equipment does not exceed
acceptable noise limits.
2.8.1.2.1.3. (Added) Power Hand Tools.
2.8.1.2.1.3.1. (Added) Single hearing protection is required when operating powered hand tools
producing noise levels greater than or equal to 85 dBA. These tools should be marked, when
feasible, to alert personnel of the potential noise hazard and the required personal protective
equipment (PPE). Under certain circumstances, supervisors may require the use of hearing
protection when using a tool that does not normally require it. For example: A common drill
does not require hearing protection when drilling through soft metals and wood; but it may emit
a high-pitch squeal when drilling through harder metals. In this case the supervisor should
require the use of hearing protection.
2.8.1.2.2. (Added) Hazardous Noise Areas.
2.8.1.2.2.1. (Added) A hazardous noise area with any exposure at or above 85 dBA shall be
clearly identified by signs located at entrances to, or the borders of, the area. Signs should be
designed according to the guidelines in DoDI 6055.12 and AFOSHSTD 48-20. As a minimum,
signs will state the following message: CAUTION HAZARDOUS NOISE AREA HEARING
PROTECTION REQUIRED.
2.8.1.2.2.2. (Added) Personnel entering identified hazardous noise perimeters are required to
wear hearing protection when necessary.
2.8.2. (Added) Foot Protection. Protective footwear shall be provided and worn when there is a
reasonable possibility of sustaining foot injuries from heavy/sharp objects or electrical/static
electricity. All personnel, who’s normal duty includes aircraft maintenance tasks or lifting
objects weighing over 30 pounds, will wear safety shoes.
2.8.3. (Added) Reflective Gear. Personnel exposed to vehicle or aircraft traffic during hours of
darkness or periods of reduced visibility will be provided and use a reflective belt. All
maintenance personnel will wear a reflective belt while performing duty on the flight line from
official sunset until sunrise. Reflective belts will not be worn in a Bandoleer style; but will be
worn around the waist of the outer most garment.

or exposure to energized electrical circuits. Placing tape over rings or wearing gloves on the
hand with a ring does not provide protection or eliminate the requirement to remove finger rings
2.8.4.1. (Added) Necklaces or lanyards (metal, cloth, elastic, etc.), except for restricted area
badge or a whistle for towing with a lanyards with a breakaway device, will not be worn around
the neck when performing hands-on maintenance of any type. NOTE: A whistle (secured by a
lanyard that does not breakaway) may be worn around the neck only during aircraft tow
operations.
2.8.4.2. (Added) Watches/bracelets will not be worn when performing maintenance with
exposure to open circuits or during munitions loading.
2.8.4.3. (Added) When working around energized electrical circuits, metal eyeglasses shall be

9.2. Specific impoundment program procedures have been developed and published within this
supplement to AFI 21-101.
9.2.1. (Added) If a single incident or event occurs that involves multiple end items owned by
different squadrons; then each squadron will initiate the impoundment process for their owned
asset, i.e., EMS Production Supervision would ensure impoundment of AGE, and Aircraft
Maintenance Squadron (AMXS) Production Supervision would separately impound an aircraft
(not in phase) for a related incident.
9.2.2. (Added) Procedures for Engine Removal from Impounded Aircraft:
9.2.2.1. (Added) The Aircraft Impoundment Official (IO) will notify CMS Production Super of
the engine removal.
9.2.2.1.1. (Added) CMS Production Super will provide the names of gaining IA and IOs to QA
to facilitate the new impound number and package for the engine.
9.2.2.2. (Added) The outgoing IO will brief the incoming IO on the affected equipment and all
troubleshooting accomplished.
9.2.2.3. (Added) The original aircraft impoundment will be cleared normally.

9.4.1.2. (Added) Table A23.2 is provided only as a list of suggested warranted impoundments.
Impoundment authorities are not limited by this list.
9.4.6.6. Once an engine has been identified as having or suspected of having FOD the aircraft or
engine impoundment decision will be based on guidance contained in Attachment 24.
 24                             AFI21-101_AETCSUP_LUKEAFBSUP 24 OCTOBER 2011


9.4.6.6.1. (Added) If the FOD is considered to be isolated to the engine (not caused by or
related to the aircraft) and the engine must be removed for repair, the owning unit will contact
CMS Production Super to coordinate impoundment of the engine. This notification must take
place upon verifying that the engine must come out due to FOD.
9.4.6.6.1.1. (Added) Once notified of an engine with impoundable FOD, CMS Production
Super will contact MOCC to coordinate the engine impoundment.
9.4.6.6.1.2. (Added) The owning unit will remove the impounded engine but will not perform
any additional maintenance to the engine without the impound official’s permission.
9.4.6.6.2. (Added) When a FOD incident occurs during an engine maintenance run, any items
contributing to the incident will be impounded (i.e., the aircraft, equipment, AGE, anti-personnel
guard or bellmouth screen).
9.4.6.6.3. (Added) No maintenance action will be accomplished without the concurrence of the
impoundment official. The wing FOD NonCommissioned Officer (NCO) and impoundment
officer will jointly investigate the incident. In the event the wing FOD NCO is not available,
MXQ and a representative from Wing Safety will perform the initial investigation following AFI
21-101, AETC SUP 1, LUKEAFB SUP 1, LUKEAFBI 21-107, Preventing Foreign Object
Damage and AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports.
9.5.1.1. (Added) If the IO must be changed, notify IA and request the change (IA MUST
approve the change). If approved, the IA must document the Impound Log authorizing the
change for engines or equipment. For aircraft, an Info Note will be placed in the AFTO Form
781 series of the change. Once approved, notify QA and document the changeover on the
Impoundment Worksheet. Ensure the gaining IO is fully briefed on all actions taken or in-work.
9.5.1.2. (Added) All IOs must attend the IO training course (code 32024) taught by QA to be
certified as an IO. Course code 32024 will be tracked in IMDS. No IO will be authorized unless
this course is accomplished and course code 32024 is updated in IMDS. Course code 32024 will
be used to track authorized IO.
9.6.1.1. (Added) Ensure that a separate RED X symbol is placed in the applicable AFTO Form
781A or AFTO Form 244 with the word “IMPOUNDED” written in red and a statement
indicating the reason for impoundment along with the name of the assigned IOs. If the
equipment has no forms, attach an AFTO Form 350 with the appropriate text in the discrepancy
block and border the tag in RED.

action statement: “INVESTIGATION COMPLETE, ALL CORRECTIVE ACTIONS HAVE
BEEN REVIEWED, (pick one; AIRCRAFT/EQUIPMENT) RELEASED IAW AFI 21-101,
SEE PAGE X ITEM X” (refers to original discrepancy). The MXG Release Authority will sign
the impoundment worksheet (to include specifying if an OCF or FCF is or is not required) and as
applicable sign the “INSPECTED BY” block of the AFTO Form 781A or AFTO Form 244 red
X entry.
9.6.9.6. (Added) In the event an aircraft is impounded off station the 56 MXG Release
Authority will review all required documentation IAW paragraph 9.6.13.1.1.4. of this
supplement, sign off the impoundment worksheet and direct the IO to sign off the AFTO Form
781A impoundment discrepancy as follows: The IO will sign the “CORRECTED BY” block
and input the following corrective action statement: “INVESTIGATION COMPLETE, ALL
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN REVIEWED, (pick one; AIRCRAFT/EQUIPMENT)
RELEASED IAW AFI 21-101, SEE PAGE X ITEM X” (refers to original discrepancy)
Impoundment “Released by (Release Authority (RA) Name and Grade) on (Date and Time)”.
The IO will then initial the “INSPECTED BY” block and place their last name initial over the
symbol per TO 00-20-1 para 4.5.6.
9.6.9.7. (Added) After releasing the impoundment, the IO is responsible to clear the RA’s
impoundment discrepancy in IMDS (if applicable). Show corrective action as “AIRCRAFT
RELEASED BY (RA Name and Grade) ON (Date/Time)” and clear the entry using the
