SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Paragraphs 3 and 6 include minor process additions/changes/deletions affecting Wing Plans,
Protocol, Communications Squadron, Logistics Squadron, Force Support Squadron and Security

1. Overview: The objective of this instruction is to provide guidance for coordinating the
support requirements for visiting inspection teams. Support requirements for inspection teams
include facilities, equipment, supplies, lodging, transportation, personnel, communications, and

MW will provide support as requested. Workcenter space will be determined by availability of
real property as determined by Wing Commander, based upon the recommendation of the Chief
of Wing Plans and Programs.
