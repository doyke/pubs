                                            Chapter 1

                                          OVERVIEW

1.1. General Purpose. Wing Plans Office (XP) oversees the development, writing, reviewing,
updating, and briefing of all unit peacetime/wartime plans for the commander. It is the focal
point on all readiness/combat integration requirements to meet training, mobilization,
deployment, sustainment, employment, redeployment, and other higher headquarters taskings.
The Chief of Wing Plans is responsible for advising the Wing Commander and his/her staff on
the contents of unit and higher headquarters tasked plans during contingency operations and
exercises. The Chief of Wing Plans identifies related resource requirements and is the
coordinating function between the unit and other agencies for planning matters.
1.2. Organizational Structure.
     1.2.1. Air Force Oversight. Headquarters Air Force (HAF) has little oversight over the
     Wing-level Plans Office, instead delegating that role to the gained MAJCOM and the Wing
     Commander. However, HAF dictates Air Force doctrine and long-range planning to the
     MAJCOMs, which in turn integrates it into their planning. HAF advises component
     headquarters planners, via the WMP-3 Parts 1-4, of the resources available to support joint
     requirements.
        1.2.1.1. HAF Regional Plans and Issues (AF/A5XX) is the Air Force POC for
        contingency plan reviews and tasks MAJCOMs to review plans and provide comments.
        1.2.1.2. The following identifies the HAF source of planning requirements, which filter
        down to the MAJCOMs and, eventually, to the Wing Planner:
            1.2.1.2.1. The Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff, Air and Space Operations (A3/AS) is
            responsible:
               1.2.1.2.1.1. To the Chief of Staff for developing Air Force positions on strategy,
               policy, and objectives, and for preparing and implementing plans and operations.
               1.2.1.2.1.2. For unilateral and joint war planning.
               1.2.1.2.1.3. For the development of Air Force Doctrine and long-range plans for
               the employment of air and space of both active and Reserve Components.
            1.2.1.2.2. The Directorate of Operational Plans and Joint Matters:
               1.2.1.2.2.1. Orchestrates AF participation in Joint and Regional War and
               Mobilization Planning Communities.
               1.2.1.2.2.2. Is the critical operator voice linking AF CONOPS to Air Force
               strategy, plans, and programming functions.
            1.2.1.2.3. War and Mobilization Plans Division provides the best wartime and
            contingency planning policies, guidance, and systems to the Air Force. It is
            responsible for:
               1.2.1.2.3.1. Supporting expeditionary war planning, execution processes and
               resolution of mobilization issues.
ANGI10-400 2 APRIL 2014                                                                      5


            1.2.1.2.3.2. Air Staff positions on mobility and deployment issues for deliberate
            and crisis action planning.
            1.2.1.2.3.3. Managing programs, maintaining and developing documents in the
            joint and interagency environment in support of the Joint Strategic Planning
            System (JSPS).
            1.2.1.2.3.4. Executing strategic planning responsibilities and providing military
            advice to the National Command Authority (NCA).
            1.2.1.2.3.5. Providing formal input through Air Staff coordination as OPR for the
            Contingency Planning Guidance (CPG) and the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan
            (JSCP) to feed the Planning, Programming, and Budget System (PPBS).
     1.2.1.3. Component commanders, joint task force commanders, and subordinate unified
     commanders support concept development, COA development, and other tasks as
     directed by the supported command and the JFP.
        1.2.1.3.1. Planners from various functional areas may be tasked to produce
        "estimates of the situation." These estimates help determine supportability of courses
        of action by appropriate staff directors. The format for the estimate of the situation
        may be tailored to suit the functional area and specific needs of the OPLAN being
        supported.
        1.2.1.3.2. The commander's estimate and other planning guidance should be used by
        the planner as a reference document for drafting the functional area input to the plan.
  1.2.2. MAJCOM Oversight. Supporting MAJCOMs provide guidance and procedures for
  command-gained units to review OPLANS and identify discrepancies between taskings and
  actual unit capabilities/ authorizations.
     1.2.2.1. Supporting MAJCOMs submit supporting plans according to the instructions of
     the component headquarters with primary planning responsibility. The component
     headquarters will review the submitted OPLANs and advise the MAJCOMs if the
     OPLANs require changes. MAJCOMs will adjust supporting plans as required.
     1.2.2.2. The A3X Division at the MAJCOM has direct oversight of Operational Wing
     Plans. The A3X Division provides guidance to Wing Plans Officers and tasks each
     gained unit with maintaining and/or generating OPLANS at the Wing level.
     1.2.2.3. MAJCOM A3X Divisions should maintain a Plans Listing and Summary which
     is designed to provide a condensed reference of all MAJCOM war and contingency plans
     and associated commitments.
        1.2.2.3.1. The summary outlines MAJCOM plans of all classifications and all wing-
        level plans required by individual MAJCOM directives.
        1.2.2.3.2. MAJCOMs should require Wing Plans Officers to publish a base plans
        summary adapted to their base.
     1.2.2.4. MAJCOMs should periodically distribute their Plans Listing and Summary to
     their gained units and notify Wing Plans Officers of any changes.

       1.2.2.5. Wing Plans Officers with planning issues pertaining to the MAJCOM function
       (e.g. mobility, special ops, combat) should contact the Functional Area Manager (FAM)
       at the MAJCOM A3X Division.
    1.2.3. NGB Wing Plans Function. The National Guard Bureau provides guidance and
    support to both Operational Plans and Logistics Plans at the Wing level.
       1.2.3.1. NGB/A3X is the Operational Plans and Execution Division at Andrews AFB,
       MD. It is responsible for:
          1.2.3.1.1. Operational planning, combat readiness evaluation, and training for 89
          ANG flying units with over 1300 aircraft and 107,000 Guardsmen throughout the
          United States, District of Columbia, and territories.
          1.2.3.1.2. Planning and execution of ANG forces in the Aerospace Expeditionary
          Force (AEF) for contingency and combat operations.
          1.2.3.1.3. Directly coordinating with Air Staff, Secretariat, Joint Staff, OSD and all

       mobilization contingency planning and Global Force Management (GFM) through
       sourcing ANG capabilities in Operational Plans (OPLANS) and Concept Plans
       (CONPLANS).
          1.2.3.2.1. It is the OPR for plans management, mobilization planning, plans review,
          and war plans development.
          1.2.3.2.2. Provides the Wing Planner with force structure and planning documents.

          informed force management decisions by integrating Assignment, Apportionment,
          and Allocation processes.
       1.2.3.3. The NGB/A3XW Functional Area Manager (FAM) plays a vital role in the
       planning and execution of all contingency operations in which the ANG is involved. The
       FAM assists Wing Planners with the execution of their duties, provides training
       materials, and several other important documents, which are available on the
       NGB/A3XW Community of Practice (CoP) webpage.
    1.2.4. Wing Plans Function.
       1.2.4.1. The mission of the Wing Plans Office (XP) is to develop, coordinate, direct,
       control, and/or monitor all peacetime/wartime planning and execution for the
       Commander. It is the focal point on all readiness/combat integration requirements to meet
       training, mobilization, mobility, deployment, sustainment, redeployment, and other
       higher headquarters taskings.
ANGI10-400 2 APRIL 2014                                                                       7


     1.2.4.2. Every required plan is either written by or coordinated through XP. The XP
     office coordinates on and monitors all plans for which the OPR is another wing
     functional area.
     1.2.4.3. All required exercises stem from an established plan that each Wing maintains.
     The point of all exercises is to validate the plan and familiarize tasked
     individuals/agencies with their roles and responsibilities during the execution of the
     exercise.
     1.2.4.4. The XP Office consists of operations plans and logistics plans. If the Chief of
     Wing Plans is the full-time Logistics Plans Officer, then an Operations Plans Officer will
     be designated and assigned to the Wing or Group.
     1.2.4.5. Chief, Wing Plans (XP).
        1.2.4.5.1. Wing Commanders have the authority to designate either the operations
        planner position or the logistics planner position as the Chief of Wing Plans (XP).
        1.2.4.5.2. In most cases, the more experienced or higher-ranking officer should be
        the Chief of Wing Plans; however, the decision is at the discretion of the Wing
        Commander.
        1.2.4.5.3. Wing Commanders have the option of placing all planners in XP at the
        Wing or maintaining residual capability in the Operations or Mission Support Groups.
        If the second option is used, the residual plans capability in the Mission Support

                                 WING PLANS PROGRAM

2.1. Wing Plans Overview. The Wing Commander will designate the Chief of Wing Plans as
determined by the unit manning document and will establish a Wing Plans Working Group
(WPWG), chaired by the Chief of Wing Plans and comprised of plans representatives from
functional areas and tenants with wartime support requirements. Committee members
responsibilities include but are not limited to:
   2.1.1. Reviewing and approving base contingency or wartime plans.
   2.1.2. Identifying the primary base wartime missions and the available resources required to
   support the base's wartime commitment.
   2.1.3. Ensuring their units’ programs, processes, and checklists are in alignment with the
   plans in which they are tasked.
2.2. Chief of Wing Plans Responsibilities. There are specific functions the Chief of Wing
Plans is required to accomplish. Some functions may be delegated to other individuals assigned
to XP, while others should not. The primary responsibility of the Chief of Wing Plans is to
oversee the writing, reviewing, updating, and briefing of all unit-applicable plans and advise the
Wing Commander and his/her staff on the contents of these plans during contingency operations
and exercises. The roles and responsibilities of the Chief of Wing Plans are to:
   2.2.1. Chair the Wing Plans Working Group (WPWG) and actively integrate the efforts of
   all base-level planning representatives. Within this capacity, the Chief of Wing Plans will:
       2.2.1.1. Brief newly assigned unit plans representatives within 30 days of appointment.
       2.2.1.2. Conduct staff assistance visits annually to all tasked units that have contingency
       plan requirements to ensure their programs, processes, and checklists are in compliance.
   2.2.2. Manage the operational plans program IAW AFI 10-401.
   2.2.3. Contact the Wing’s MAJCOM Plans Division and NGB/A3XW/OFAMO (Office of
   Functional Area Manager Oversight) whenever a personnel change occurs in the Wing Plans
   Office to ensure they have a current list of Planners from the Wing.
   2.2.4. Review the current MAJCOM Plans Listing to ensure base compliance with plans
   requirements.
   2.2.5. Oversee and coordinate all local plans and to maintain, brief, and implement HHQ
   plans. The Wing Plans Officer is not responsible for writing and/or maintaining all unit
   plans; the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) designated in the plan is required to do
   this. The OPR is determined by the source document requiring the plan or by the Wing
   Commander. Normally, the base OPR will be functionally aligned with the HHQ OPR (e.g.
   Operations, Safety, Civil Engineering, Logistics, etc.)
   2.2.6. Ensure proper electronic distribution of base plans to tasked organizations and the
   appropriate HHQ functional OPR.
   2.2.7. Participate in site activation/deactivation task forces IAW AFI10-404 ANGSUP I.
   Actions include:
10                                                                 ANGI10-400 2 APRIL 2014

  distribution.
  2.2.13. If OPR for a plan, coordinate on and delegate responsibilities for preparation of
  functional area inputs.
  2.2.14. Ensure unit plan OPRs conduct briefings to the Wing Commander and designated
  staff on the content and status of their plans documents.
     2.2.14.1. The Wing Plans Officer is responsible for tracking the OPR review and briefing
     of each plan maintained at the Wing. The Wing Plans Officer is not required to brief all
     unit plans, as that task should be delegated to the plan OPRs, since they are the functional
     area experts and can field questions and provide detailed information.
     2.2.14.2. He/she will annually brief all HHQ plans required to be held at the Wing, to
     include DoD, AF, MAJCOM, and State plans.
     2.2.14.3. He/she will act as the coordinator for all plans briefings to include tracking and
     scheduling.
  2.2.15. Ensure unit plan OPRs maintain their respective plans.
     2.2.15.1. The Chief of Wing Plans should advise plan OPRs when their plan reviews are
     coming due. Each OPR is required to advise the Chief of Wing Plans on the status of
     each plan, when it was reviewed, and any changes made to the plan.
     2.2.15.2. It is recommended that the Chief of Wing Plans periodically review some older
     plans to ensure any HHQ-mandated changes have been reflected in the plan (i.e. AFIMS
     integration, format changes, command structure changes, etc.)
  2.2.16. Monitor unit participation in unilateral and joint exercises. He/she must be
  knowledgeable of the units’ budget constraints, real-world commitments, and capabilities in
  order to successfully accomplish effective exercise planning.
  2.2.17. Review and evaluate inspector general reports and assistance visit reports to
  determine if deficiencies are due to ineffective plans or lack of unit/personnel capability.
ANGI10-400 2 APRIL 2014                                                                     11


   He/she will initiate corrective action or proposed recommendations to the Commander as
   appropriate.
   2.2.18. Train personnel in their respective plans function assigned as additional duty plans
   officer/NCO in subordinate units.
   2.2.19. Serve on the Crisis Action Team (CAT) at the direction of the Wing Commander to
   brief and interpret plans which may be considered for implementation during a crisis
   situation.
   2.2.20. Participate as a member of the exercise planning team and ensure plan objectives are
   being met in the exercise scenario.
2.3. Wing XP Shop Responsibilities. The Wing XP Shop will:
   2.3.1. Analyze USAF, gaining MAJCOM, and ANG directives and basic plans, and develop
   implementing instructions for the successful accomplishment of tasking requirements.
   2.3.2. Support, develop, and manage planning and execution requirements, to include
   contingency and crisis action planning, to support all possible wartime contingencies when
   tasked by HHQ.
      2.3.2.1. Develop supplements, attachments, or original planning documents related to
      higher headquarters Operational Plans (OPLANS), Concept of Operations (CONOPS),
      Operational Orders (OPORDS), and MAJCOM plans and supplements IAW AFI 10-
      401V2, as required.
      2.3.2.2. Write, update, and maintain Supporting Plans, Wing Supplements, and
      Installation Plans as tasked by HHQ.
      2.3.2.3. Determine reception tasks and responsibilities.
      2.3.2.4. Identify LIMFACs and shortfalls.
   2.3.3. Maintain currency of HHQ-tasked published operations plans, orders, and directives.
   Periodically check HHQ websites for plans revisions, additional plans requirements, and
   deletions.
   2.3.4. Develop OPORDS for unit functions, activities, and events at the direction of the
   Wing Commander.
   2.3.5. Develop operational plans for base flying units and their subordinate units. Included
   is the Basic Unit Supplements (BUS) in support of gaining MAJCOM and USAF plans,
   which includes mobilization plans, Command & Control activation, recall procedures, and
   emergency messaging (see Chapter 3).
   2.3.6. The Operations Plans Officer prepares the operational annexes and associated
   appendices to other OPR’s plans on operation procedures, actions, and taskings within those
   plans.
   2.3.7. Identify tenant involvement/non-involvement in each unit plan.
   2.3.8. Attend meetings and conferences at the State, MAJCOM, and National level to keep

2.4. Wing Plans Working Group (WPWG) Responsibilities. The Wing Plans Working
Group is comprised of representatives from each tasked unit within the Wing. They do not
necessarily need to be plan OPRs. Their responsibilities are to:
   2.4.1. Be responsible for developing plans, annexes, appendices, etc., for which their agency
   is designated OPR.
      2.4.1.1. Assign responsibility and establish suspense dates for development of annexes
      by other agencies upon receipt of a new plan or supplement tasking.
      2.4.1.2. Ensure adequate instructions, checklists, etc., are developed to implement plans
      under which their agency is tasked.
   2.4.2. Periodically review and update unit plans to ensure tasking is realistic and the unit can
   perform missions or requirements mandated by ANG or the gaining MAJCOM. To
   accomplish this, WPWG representatives must have a comprehensive knowledge of the unit's
   mission, functional area knowledge, methods of operation, projected conversions, authorized
   manpower, and available assets.
   2.4.3. Notify the wing plans officer when a higher-headquarters directive or plan creates a
   requirement to develop or change a wing plan. Specify required wing actions by endorsement
   or memo to the wing plans officer, and monitor and document all actions through appropriate
   suspenses and follow up actions.
   2.4.4. Initiate or change existing plans or directives to conform to policy decisions made by
   the unit commander, ANG, or gaining MAJCOM when required.
   2.4.5. Provide input to policies and problems which have impact on unit planning concepts.
   2.4.6. Participate in staff assistance visits within their agency with the wing plans officer.

                                           Chapter 3

                                  PLANS MANAGEMENT

3.1. Plan Categories. Planning results in different types of plans depending on the level of
detail required. These are concept plans (CONPLANs), operational plans (OPLANs), supporting
plans, operation orders (OPORDS), functional plans, Programming Plans (PPLANS), and crisis
action planning orders.
   3.3.1. CONPLANs. A CONPLAN is an operational plan in an abbreviated format that may
   require considerable expansion or alteration to convert it into an OPLAN. The objective of
   concept planning is to develop sound operational and support concepts that can be rapidly
   expanded into an OPORD if necessary. CONPLANS are rarely generated at the Wing level;
   however, they are used as a basis for creating supporting plans such as OPLANS and
   OPORDS by Wing Plans Officers.
   3.3.2. OPLANs. An OPLAN is a written description of a commander's concept of
   operations to counter a perceived threat or potentially hazardous situation. Is has multiple
   applications at every level of Air Force planning. It may be used as the basis of a theater
   campaign plan at the HAF level all the way down to the base level to plan for an expected
   event or potential situation. Often, an OPLAN is operationalized into an OPORD. An
   OPLAN includes a basic plan, annexes, appendices, and, in the case of a combatant-
   supported OPLAN, a supporting TPFDD.
   3.3.3. Supporting Plans. Supporting plans are prepared as tasked by the supported
   combatant commanders in support of their contingency plans. They are prepared by
   supporting combatant commanders, subordinate joint force commanders, component
   commanders, or other agencies. These commanders may, in turn, assign their subordinates
   the task of preparing additional supporting plans at the MAJCOM, NAF, or Wing level.
   3.3.4. OPORD. OPORDs are prepared under procedures in prescribed formats during crisis
   action planning. They appear in the form of a directive issued by a commander to
   subordinates to effect the coordinated execution of an operation (e.g. air operations, training
   exercises, event planning, etc.).
   3.3.5. Functional Plans. Functional plans involve military operations in a peacetime or
   permissive environment. These types of plans are for humanitarian assistance, disaster relief,
   peacekeeping, or counter-drug operations and are generally a proactive step in preparing for a
   possible operation. Functional plans are written using the JOPES procedures and formats
   specified for a CONPLAN without a TPFDD.
   3.3.6. PPLANS. Programming plans are directive and provide planning guidance and
   assign responsibilities for implementing and monitoring major programmed actions that
   affect ANG units. Programming letters or messages normally address minor programming
   actions and may be used in lieu of PPlans. The unit XP is the focal point for the wing
   commander for all programming actions to include conversions, activations, base
   closures/realignments, cantonments, relocations, deactivations, PPlans, site activation task
   force visits (SATAF), site surveys, etc.
 14                                                                ANGI10-400 2 APRIL 2014


   3.3.7. Crisis Action Planning Orders. Several orders are used to direct preparations,
   planning, deployment, and execution of plans in response to crises.
      3.3.7.1. Warning Order (WARNORD). The Warning Order initiates course of action
      (COA) development and applies to the supported command and supporting commands.
      The WARNORD establishes command relationships (designating supported and
      supporting commanders) and provides the mission, objectives, and known constraints. It
      establishes a tentative C-day and L-hour. It may apportion capabilities for planning
      purposes or task the combatant commander to develop a list of forces required to confront
      the crisis. A warning order does not authorize movement of forces unless specifically
      stated. If the crisis is progressing rapidly, a planning order or alert order may be issued
      instead. When a WARNORD is issued, the Air Force component headquarters
      commander prepares a TPFDD in DCAPES for the Air Force portion of the supported
      commander‘s TPFDD in JOPES.
      3.3.7.2. Planning Order (PLANORD). A PLANORD directs execution planning
      before a COA is formally approved by the SecDef and President of the United States. If
      the PLANORD is used in lieu of a WARNORD, the PLANORD will include a COA,
      provide combat forces and strategic lift for planning purposes, and establish a tentative C-
      day and L-hour. The PLANORD will not be used to deploy forces or increase readiness
      unless approved by the SecDef.
      3.3.7.3. Alert Order (ALERTORD). The SecDef approves and transmits an
      ALERTORD to the supported commander and JPEC announcing the selected COA. This
      order will describe the COA sufficiently to allow the supported commander and JPEC to
      begin or continue the detailed planning necessary to deploy forces. If the ALERTORD is
      used in lieu of a WARNORD, the PLANORD will include a COA, provide combat forces
      and strategic lift for planning purposes, and establish a tentative C-day and L-hour. In a
      time-sensitive crisis, an Execute Order may be issued in lieu of an ALERTORD.
      3.3.7.4. Execute Order (EXORD). This order is issued by the authority and direction
      of the SecDef and directs the deployment and/or employment of forces. The goal of the
      crisis action planning system is to reserve the EXORD solely for initiating or terminating
      the employment of U.S. military forces.
      3.3.7.5. Prepare to Deploy Order (PTDO), Deployment Order (DEPORD) and
      Redeployment Order. Issued by the SecDef, these orders are used to prepare forces to
      deploy or deploy forces without approving the execution of a plan or OPORD.
3.2. Types of Planning.
   3.2.1. Contingency Planning (Proactive). Combatant commanders, their components, and
   supporting commands, to include Wings, accomplish contingency planning during peacetime
   conditions. Planners use scenarios and threats identified in national guidance, such as the
   JSCP, along with the combatant commander's evaluation of their AOR, to develop a series of
   plans that span a wide range of operations. The process for contingency planning is cyclic
   and continual and is almost identical whether the resulting operation plan is a fully developed
   OPLAN, CONPLAN, or FUNCPLAN. Operations plans remain in effect until canceled or
   superseded by another approved plan. While in effect, they are continuously maintained and
   updated.
ANGI10-400 2 APRIL 2014                                                                          15


   3.2.2. Base Level Contingency Planning. Base level planning is required for contingency
   and crisis action planning. As a minimum, base-level plans must address mobilization,
   reception (ADVON), deployment, employment, sustainment, and redeployment planning
   required for the combat forces to accomplish its mission. All installations with a wartime
   mission, regardless of size or location must develop base support plans according to AFI 10-
   404, Base Support and Expeditionary Site Planning.
   3.2.3. Crisis Action Planning (Reactive). Crisis action planning is driven by current events
   in real time and normally occurs in emergencies and in the context of time-sensitive
   situations. Planners base their efforts on the actual circumstances that exist when crisis action
   planning occurs. Detailed guidance and instructions are located in JOPES Volumes I-III,
   Operations Planning. This formal process develops responses to potential crises, determines
   forces required to achieve objectives, prepares deployment plans, and continually evaluates
   selected COAs. This process results in a series of formal plans within each theater that
   contain lists of apportioned forces and their time-phased deployment schedules. Air Force
   planners, regardless of organization, will use DCAPES, force modules, and UTCs during the
   crisis action planning process. DCAPES is the Air Force feeder to JOPES. DCAPES use is
   directed because it provides a variety of capabilities to Air Force planners and agencies not
   found in JOPES that are necessary for management and oversight of Air Force planning and
   execution. Force modules and UTCs are the building blocks of AEWs, AEGs, and AESs –
   the way the Air Force presents and sources capabilities to the JPEC.
   3.2.4. Long Range Planning. This function is primarily accomplished at Plans and
   Programming Divisions (A3XP) at the HAF and MAJCOM level and the results of the
   planning filter down to the Wing level. A role of the Wing Planner is to evaluate long range
   programs as they apply to wing-level functions and capabilities and recommend plan
   revisions and updated approaches.
3.3. Required Wing Plans. There are five levels of plans each ANG Wing is required to
maintain: DoD, HAF, MAJCOM, State, and Wing. The level of plan usually determines the role
the Wing Plans Officer has in managing it.
   3.3.1. DoD Plans. The Department of Defense maintains plans supporting government
   agencies, most notably the Department of Homeland Security. These plans are far reaching
   in their scope and encompass all services and many government organizations. Wing Plans
   shops are required to maintain some DoD plans as directed by their MAJCOMS.
   3.3.2. HAF Plans. Most HAF plans are not required to be maintained at the Wing level.
   MAJCOMS usually write command-specific classified and unclassified plans in support of
   them, detailing their role in a specific contingency and tasking subordinate commanders
   under their command.
   3.3.3. MAJCOM Plans. MAJCOM plans are supporting plans for HAF, combatant
   commanders, and can also be stand-alone plans as in the case of the Omnibus Plan or
   Continuity of Operations plans. Wing Plans Officers need to be familiar with their
   MAJCOM plans in order to identify any unit taskings upon plan implementation. Some
   MAJCOM plans task Wings with writing a supporting plan (i.e. Natural Disaster Aircraft
   Evacuation Plan) based on their plan.
16                                                                ANGI10-400 2 APRIL 2014


  3.3.4. State Plans. The ANG is responsible for maintaining any State plan in which they are
  tasked. Most states have a Joint Military Support Plan, which provides guidance and
  identifies capabilities in the support of domestic operations. The plan is written by the joint
  staff at the State Guard Bureau and includes Army and Air support to civilian authorities.
  Wing Planners need to ensure they provide air asset capability input into the plan.
  3.3.5. Wing Plans. Every Wing level plan maintained by the unit will have an Office of
  Primary Responsibility (OPR). The designated OPR is required to write, maintain, review,
  and brief the plan for which they’re responsible. Below are examples of plans which the
  Wing may be required to maintain:
     3.3.5.1. Basic Unit Supplement (BUS). The BUS is based on the MAJCOM Omnibus
     Plan (S), which identifies tasks and functional responsibilities which are common to the
     support of all USAF and MAJCOM OPLANS, OPORDs, and other operational
     directives, to include ICC and subordinate control center activation, recall and assembly
     procedures, and unit roles and responsibilities of assigned unit personnel during periods
     of increased readiness or mobilization. Units have the option of using the BUS as their
     mobilization plan. The OPR for the BUS should be the Ops Planner.
     3.3.5.2. Continuity of Operations (COOP). COOPs provide for the continuation of
     mission-essential Wing functions and operations under conditions of imminent/post
     attack, natural disaster, or any other situation which would result in the evacuation of any
     or all base facilities. Plans Officers should be involved in preparing emergency
     relocation action procedures and associated checklists to be conducted by Wing units,
     and will coordinate these actions with their State Joint Force Headquarters and ANGRC
     IAW AFI 10-208. Each ANG Wing will write and maintain a COOP plan with the Ops
     Planner as the OPR. This plan may be implemented in conjunction with other plans such
     as the aircraft evacuation plan or Disease Containment Plan. The COOP will address
     relocation actions for three different scenarios:
         3.3.5.2.1. Building evacuation and reconstitution to another building on the
         installation (e.g. fire, bomb threat, etc.).
         3.3.5.2.2. Installation evacuation and reconstitution to another site in the local area
         (e.g. gas leak, flooding, etc.).
         3.3.5.2.3. Installation evacuation and reconstitution to another site outside the local
         area (e.g. hurricane evacuation).
     3.3.5.3. Base Support Plan. The Base Support Plan identifies the facility, equipment,
     and personnel capabilities of the installation, to include tenant organizations. It is
     primarily developed for locations with a permanent Air Force presence and is fully
     developed by the collaborative planning efforts of many functional experts with a
     deliberate planning time line. Major conversions or mission changes will require the
     Base Support Plan to be rewritten outofcycle. The OPR should be LGRR. See AFI10-
     404 ANGSUP I for Base Support Plan format, content, and security classification
     guidance.
     3.3.5.4. Installation Deployment Plan (IDP). Deployment plans are written IAW AFI
     10403. Generally, a deployment plan (formerly called the base mobility plan) is written
     for an installation. It addresses the mobility/deployment work centers and procedures
ANGI10-400 2 APRIL 2014                                                                     17


      used for processing personnel and equipment for deployment. LGRR on ANG bases are
      responsible for writing the plan and may be required to review and make inputs to the
      host base IDP when tenants on other than an ANG bases. Specific OPORDs may be
      written for unit deployments, time permitting. The OPR for the IDP should be LGRR.
      3.3.5.5. Survival, Recovery, and Reconstitution Plan (SRR). SRR plans provide
      guidance for preemptive evacuation to improve survival probability for our forces/assets,
      and enhanced recovery and reconstitution operations following an enemy attack or
      natural disaster. All flying units are required to maintain a MAJCOM aircraft dispersal
      plan and unit Ops Planners are responsible for writing local supporting plans to that SRR
      plan if on an ANG base, or provide input to host base supporting plans if the Guard unit
      is a tenant. Supporting plans include specific procedures and movement schedule for
      transporting personnel and cargo to the refuge/dispersal location(s). The OPR for any

      3.3.5.6. Local Plans. Figure 3.1 is a list of local plans that an ANG unit may be tasked
      with maintaining. This list is not inclusive and ANG Wings may not be required to
      maintain some of them. Likewise, some Wings, due to geographic location, mission, or
      MAJCOM, may be required to maintain plans not listed. This list does not include plans
      described above.

  3.3.6. Plans Lists. The Chief of Wing Plans is required to maintain a Wing Plans List. The
  source tasking for plans kept at the Wing level are:
     3.3.6.1. The MAJCOM A3X Division provides a plans listing to their gained units which
     identify which classified and unclassified plans they are required to maintain.
     3.3.6.2. Individual plans may direct units to create and maintain supporting plans.
     3.3.6.3. AF, MAJCOM, or NGB Instructions or Supplements for a particular functional
     area may task units with writing and maintaining Wing plans based on the instruction
     (e.g. Units are required to maintain an OPLAN 10-2 Comprehensive Emergency
     Management Plan as directed in AFI10-2501).
     3.3.6.4. At the Commander’s discretion.
ANGI10-400 2 APRIL 2014                                                                           19


                                            Chapter 4

                                       WRITING PLANS

4.1. Source Documents.
   4.1.1. AFMAN 10-401V2, Planning Formats and Guidance is the primary source for plan
   writing. It outlines the structure and content of OPLANs, OPORDs, CONOPs, and other
   types of orders. It explains format and content for the elements of any plan:
   4.1.2. AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution outlines the planning
   process at the HAF and MAJCOM level. Chapter 3 contains practical information on
   explaining the planning process, the types of plans and orders, and the different types of
   planning methodologies.
   4.1.3. AFI 10-402V1, Mobilization Planning and Personnel Readiness identifies the
   requirements for mobilization planning and is the primary resource for a unit’ mobilization
   plan or BUS.
   4.1.4. AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution is the resource for a unit’s
   Installation Deployment Plan.
   4.1.5. AFI 10-404, Base Support and Expeditionary Site Planning is the resource for a unit’s
   In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Plan.
4.2. Customer Identification. Plans are not created in a vacuum; they are an important tool to
use for a Wing to prepare for expected or unexpected situations. Therefore, plans must be
written with a keen focus on their customers.
   4.2.1. The first step in writing, or even rewriting, a plan is to identify who the customers are.
       4.2.1.1. Primary customers are those individuals, sections, or units who are directly
       tasked in a plan.
       4.2.1.2. Secondary, or follow-on, customers are:
           4.2.1.2.1. Those in leadership roles at the Wing level, such as the Wing Commander
           and/or Group Commanders, who are not directly tasked in the plan. While they may
           oversee the implementation of the plan, they do not play a role in it.
           4.2.1.2.2. Those who benefit from the plan, such as outside agencies, other services,
           MAJCOMS, Combatant Commanders, etc.
       4.2.1.3. The content of the plan should focus on the primary customers, but the
       objectives of the plan should focus on the secondary customers. Both are equally
       important; therefore the emphasis on both primary and secondary customers should also
       be equally important.
4.3. Customer Requirements. Plans should be written from the perspective of the customer. A
solid plan keeps the focus on what they need in order to use the plan efficiently and effectively.
   4.3.1. Customer interface is a vital role of the Wing Plans Office. Offices of Primary
   Responsibility (OPRs) are primary customers to the Wing Plans shop. When OPRs are
   required to write or update a plan, the XP shop must:
 20                                                                 ANGI10-400 2 APRIL 2014


       4.3.1.1. Interact with them, as required, to determine their preliminary program plans and
       requirements. The XP shop should be involved from the beginning of the process, not
       wait until a unit has produced an end product.
       4.3.1.2. Evaluate their preliminary plans and provide feedback on technical feasibility,
       policy and legal aspects, safety considerations, and compatibility with other customers
       and Air Force plans. It’s the role of the shop to provide alternative recommendations and
       cross-functional process improvements.
       4.3.1.3. Formulate, staff, and provide formal and/or informal responses to them on the
       feasibility of plans.
       4.3.1.4. Advise them on functional area plan format, content clarity, and objective focus.
       4.3.1.5. Oversee the final draft preparation.
       4.3.1.6. Establish a feedback process to ensure they’re satisfied with the XP support and
       that their requirements are being met.
4.4. Plan Writing Process. Wing Plans Officers will either write or oversee the writing of all
unit-level plans. The guidance for writing plans is found in AFMAN 10-401V2.
   4.4.1. Wings will assign a number and/or title to unit plans to coincide with the number
   and/or title of the HHQ plans or instructions they support or as specified by HHQ directive.
   4.4.2. Most of the plans the Wing Planner will be tasked to write will be based on other
   documents.
       4.4.2.1. AF and MAJCOM plans and instructions will dictate whether a plan is required
       to be written and maintained at the Wing.
       4.4.2.2. AF, MAJCOM, or Combatant Commander OPORDS, OPLANS, or
       CONPLANS may require tasked Wings to write a supplemental or supporting OPORD or
       OPLAN.
       4.4.2.3. The Wing Natural Disaster Aircraft Evacuation Plan (NDAEP) is based on the
       AMC NDAEP, using the same format and information, only written at the Wing level.
   4.4.3. Contingency or event planning may require the OPR to access several instructions to
   create an effective Wing level OPLAN or OPORD.
   4.4.4. Writing a plan from scratch can be a long and difficult process. It’s recommended
   that the OPR network with other plans shops or research the system to uncover an existing
   plan another unit has written. MAJCOM XP FAMs may be able to help in referring an OPR
   to another unit’s plans shop. Another approach would be to take a similar plan and use it as a
   template, keeping the structure and much of the information, for the new plan.
   4.4.5. Plan Structure. All plans should include these elements in the order listed, unless
   specified otherwise in HHQ directives:
       4.4.5.1. Plan Covers. The cover must show the date of the plan, the issuing
       headquarters, short title and number of the plan, restricted data or formerly restricted data
       when required, source of classification, and downgrading or declassification instructions.
       Covers must not contain classified information. Mark top and bottom of both covers with
ANGI10-400 2 APRIL 2014                                                                          21


     the overall classification of the plan. Card stock covers may be used on all plans.
     Classified plan covers must be red card stock.
     4.4.5.2. Letter of Transmittal. The letter of transmittal of a contingency plan should
     identify the reason for preparing the plan. The need for preparing further supporting plans
     must be specified. The OPR for the plan must be identified and disposition instructions
     must be included when the plan supersedes a previous plan.
     4.4.5.3. Security Instructions and Record of Changes. The security instructions must
     include the long and short titles of the plan and must be the first page (i) following the
     letter of transmittal. State the classification of the plan and any reproduction limitations.
     The record of changes for the plan may be included on the same page as the security
     instructions, or may be a separate page published on the back of the security instructions.
     Reproduction and limitation instructions are included on "Security Instructions" page.
     4.4.5.4. Plan Summary. The plan summary is used for all contingency plans. It
     provides a concise description of the purpose to be achieved by implementing the plan. It
     also provides a brief review of conditions for implementation, operations to be
     conducted, assumptions, operational constraints, command relationships, logistics
     requirements, limiting factors, and commander's appraisal of the logistics and
     transportation feasibility of the plan.
     4.4.5.5. Table of Contents. Annex designations are a guide only and may be realigned
     when necessary to fit specific needs. The table of contents should include elements that
     are published separately.
     4.4.5.6. Basic Plan. The basic plan consists of six main paragraphs shown below, which
     should be used in all plans. Additional paragraph headings may be used to fit the
     particular needs of the plan. Detailed information on tasking for lower echelons of
     command is normally not covered in the basic plan, but should be covered in the
     appropriate annexes and appendices.
     4.4.5.7. The basic plan will be signed by the wing commander or designated
     representative.
        4.4.5.7.1. Purpose: Provide a concise description of the purpose to be achieved by
        implementing the plan. If this is a supporting plan, indicate the plan it supports.
            4.4.5.7.1.1. General: Describe the general environment that would establish the
            probable preconditions for implementation of this plan.
            4.4.5.7.1.2. Assumptions: List the assumptions on which the plan is based. That
            is, list either the conditions most likely to exist or other conditions likely to have a
            significant impact on this plan as a whole. (Additionally, assumptions about
            specific aspects of the operation should be included in appropriate annexes.).
        4.4.5.7.2. Conditions for Implementation:
            4.4.5.7.2.1. Summarize the politico-military situation in which execution of the
            plan should be considered, if applicable.
            4.4.5.7.2.2. Summarize any legal and environmental considerations that could
            impact on plan implementation.
22                                                               ANGI10-400 2 APRIL 2014


         4.4.5.7.3. Operations to be Conducted:
            4.4.5.7.3.1. Concept of Operations: This explains the operations to be conducted.
            It should describe the general nature and purpose of the operations to be
            conducted, and the coordination and cooperation necessary to execute actions
            required by the plan.
            4.4.5.7.3.2. Tasks: In separately lettered subparagraphs, list each task assigned to
            each applicable commander.
         4.4.5.7.4. Assumptions: List all assumptions.
            4.4.5.7.4.1. Administration: State what the administrative requirements are if
            other than "normal." Any requirement for operating instructions or checklists in
            support of the plan may be addressed here.
            4.4.5.7.4.2. Logistics: Provide broad guidance on how support will be furnished.
            For detailed guidance on major aspects of required support, refer the reader to the
            appropriate annex.
         4.4.5.7.5. Operational Constraints: List major factors           that   may    impede
         accomplishing the mission, to include any limiting factors.
         4.4.5.7.6. Command Relationships: If other than "normal," identify the command
         and control relationship such as between the wing and an off-base agency that
         supports the plan.
     4.4.5.8. Attachments to the Plan. Annexes used for the plan should be listed on the
     final page of the basic plan. Other attachments (appendices, tabs, exhibits, or maps) are
     listed on the final page of any attachment which has further attachments. The basic plan
     should refer to each annex that has been prepared; however, information provided in the
     basic plan is not normally repeated in the attachments. Annexes will be signed by the
     functional area chief charged with overall responsibility for the annex.
     4.4.5.9. Execution Checklist. The execution checklist summarizes the actions required
     by the commander preparing the plan to ensure coordinated initiation of operations.
     When a Wing Contingency or Emergency Action Plan has a significant number of
     taskings, consider having an annex consisting of checklists for the ICC, EOC, CP, and/or
     Incident Commander.
     4.4.5.10. Distribution List. The distribution list accounts for all copies of the plan and
     informs users which agencies and headquarters maintain copies of the plan. Distribution
     should be held to the minimum essential for planning. Addressees must advise plan OPRs
     of necessary changes to the distribution list.
     4.4.5.11. Distribution Change Memorandum. All plans must include a standard
     memorandum that addressees may use to notify the OPR of changes in distribution
     requirements. The distribution change memorandum normally follows the distribution list
     but may also follow the memorandum of transmittal.
  4.4.6. Approach. When writing a plan, it’s important to remember that if it gets too wordy,
  overly detailed, or continuously states the obvious, it becomes cumbersome and people won’t
  use it. This is especially true of OPORDS. A plan should not attempt to tell a functional
ANGI10-400 2 APRIL 2014                                                                        23


  area how to do their jobs, that’s what AFI’s are for. But rather, a good plan assumes the
  individuals know their job and tasks them with the what, when, and where to accomplish the
  objectives of the plan. Some repetition may be necessary since someone researching the plan
  may turn only to one section, so the same information, by design, is sometimes found in
  several places within the plan.
  4.4.7. Plan Review. A finished OPLAN is always in draft form until the Commander signs
  it. The Wing Plans Officer must distribute the plan to the affected functional areas as a draft
  to obtain input before presenting it to the Commander for approval.
     4.4.7.1. Always mark a draft as just that in the header and footer.
     4.4.7.2. Distribute the plan electronically as an attachment or reference its location on a
     shared file where everyone can access it. In the past, a hard copy was distributed with a
     routing slop; however, that process took days, weeks, or months before it came full circle
     back to the plans shop. Using the electronic medium is more efficient and the preferred
     method at the Wing level. It’s recommended to set a deadline for inputs to the plan as
     you distribute it. If inputs have not been received by the deadline, then the Plans Officer
     can assume those functional area representatives have no inputs.
     4.4.7.3. Receiving an input from a functional area representative does not mean the Plans
     shot is obligated to make the change. If something about the input doesn’t sound right or
     doesn’t make sense, it’s important to check the validity of it first. Don’t be afraid to
     contact the person for clarification. If you don’t put in a change input, it’s a courtesy to
     let the person know why you’re not putting it in.
     4.4.7.4. OPORDs do not need functional area input, just the Commander’s approval,
     since it’s an order from the Commander, not a plan. OPORD writers may coordinate
     with the tasked functional area while in the writing phase, but it’s not critical, since most
     OPORDs come from documents that have already been approved (i.e. CONOPs,
     OPLANs, OPORDs, Instructions, etc.). OPORDs may be written at the Wing level as
     instructions for a unit, based on HHQ taskings (e.g. if several UTCs have been tasked for
     a contingency, a pared down OPORD might be written using the Wing BUS as a
     template). They may also be written as instructions for a unit-level event (i.e. if a Wing
     conducts an Air Show, an OPORD would task functional areas for the planning and
     execution of the event).
     4.4.7.5. The final signature on a Wing plan is always the Wing Commander. Wing Plans
     Officers should be prepared to go over the plan with the Commander after all the
     appropriate input changes have been incorporated. If the plan is extensive, more than 50
     pages, the Wing Plans Officer should be prepared to summarize the paragraphs in the
     basic plan and annexes, as the Commander may not have adequate time to read every
     detail of the plan.
  4.4.8. Security and Document Marking. Planners should review DoDO-5200.1-I, Index of
  Security Classification Guides to determine if a plan falls under its purview. It is Air Force
  policy to identify, classify, downgrade, declassify, mark, protect, and destroy its classified
  and unclassified information and material consistent with national policy as outlined in DOD
  5200.1M.
 24                                                                ANGI10-400 2 APRIL 2014


       4.4.8.1. Classified contingency plans must be marked according to DOD Regulation
       5200.1M, Volume 2 and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management and as
       follows:
          4.4.8.1.1. Each plan must be assigned an overall security classification that is
          determined by its content. The highest classification of any part of the plan dictates
          its overall classification.
          4.4.8.1.2. Front and back covers and the letter of transmittal must be marked with the
          overall classification of the plan and any applicable dissemination control marking(s)
          (e.g., REL TO (authorized for release)) shall be included in the banner line and the
          portion markings. The final paragraph of the letter of transmittal must indicate
          whether the letter of transmittal, when classified attachments are withdrawn, is Secret,
          Confidential, or Unclassified. Any transmittal letters remaining classified after
          attachments are withdrawn must be portion marked and include the classification
          authority block
              4.4.8.1.2.1. The document must contain banner lines, portion marks, Component,
              office or origin, date of origin and classification authority blocks.
              4.4.8.1.2.2. The classification authority block will be on the face of the
              document.
              4.4.8.1.2.3. The standard format YYMMDD shall be used when specifying dates
              in the classification authority block. Include a “Classified by” line in the
              classification authority block. List name and position title or personal identifier
              of the Derivative Classifier and, if not otherwise evident, include the Component
              and office or origin.
              4.4.8.1.2.4. Include a “Derived From” line in the classification authority block.
              4.4.8.1.2.5. Include a “Declassify on” line in the classification authority block. If
              applicable, include downgrading instructions.
          4.4.8.1.3. The first page of each plan element (the annex, the appendix, the tab, etc.,)
          will bear the highest classification of any other portion of that element only if the
          element is likely to be used separately.
          4.4.8.1.4. Each interior page of the classified plan element must be marked according
          to the highest classification of the information contained on the page, or
          "Unclassified" as appropriate. “Banner line” at the top and bottom of each page.
          Each paragraph and sub elements of paragraphs must be portion marked (TS), (S),
          (C), or (U) according to the highest level of information contained in or revealed by
          it. EXCEPTION: When the entire annex, appendix, tab, etc., is unclassified, portion
          marking is not required. Place the statement: "This entire (annex, appendix, tab, etc.,)
          is unclassified" on the first page and mark "UNCLASSIFIED" at the top and bottom
          of it and each page of the unclassified attachment.
4.5. Changes to Plans. A plan should be changed rather than revised if the total adjustments,
due to any new or previously changed material, affect less than 40 percent of the plan.
   4.5.1. Identifying Changes:
ANGI10-400 2 APRIL 2014                                                                       25


     4.5.1.1. The date of the change, the date of the basic plan, and the classification of the
     plan (if other than unclassified) must be included in paragraph 1 of the letter of
     transmittal.
     4.5.1.2. A copy of the distribution list must be attached to the letter of transmittal. If a
     new annex Z is accomplished, a distribution list is not required. When page changes are
     made, the change number and the date of the change must be placed in parenthesis below
     the page number.
  4.6.1. Change Methods:
     4.6.1.1. Page Changes. This is the preferred method of change. This method re-
     accomplishes all pages containing changes. If the change contains classified material, two
     copies of AF Form 1565, Entry, Receipt, and Destruction Certificate, are prepared
     according to AFI 31-401. To indicate new or changed material, add a vertical line in the
     left margin.
     4.6.1.2. Write-In Changes. Write-in changes (in ink) are permissible but should not be
     used to make lengthy changes. This procedure may be used only for minor corrections,
     such as changes to numbers, dates, single words, short phrases, etc. If page changes are
     also being made, the write-in changes are either included on the AF Form 1565, if used,
     or listed on the change letter of transmittal.
     4.6.1.3. Electronic Changes. All Wing-held plans should be maintained as electronic
     copies on a shared drive. A summary of changes will be distributed electronically; hard
     copies will be changed as per the above guidance, and then applied to the electronic
     version.

                           INPUTS, UPDATES, AND REWRITES

5.1. Inputs. Each Wing Plans Office needs to solicit constructive inputs from functional areas
in order to create a solid plan.
   5.1.1. Getting inputs from functional area representatives is an important step in creating,
   maintaining, and improving OPLANS. Simply sending out an electronic version of a draft
   may not generate the quality of inputs a Plans Office may be expecting. It is recommended
   that when a plan is distributed, instructions accompany it directing the functional
   representative to a specific portion or annex of the plan. The Plans Office may even want to
   include questions targeting input areas in order to gain information needed for the plan.
   5.1.2. Inputs received by the Plans Office that do not contain a rationale or supporting
   documentation, will be evaluated by the Plans Officer to ensure they’re accurate and reflect
   actions that may be mandated by HHQ directives or plans, and don’t contradict other Wing
   plans procedures or taskings. If an input is not incorporated into a plan, it is a courtesy to
   advise the input submitter why it isn’t being used.
   5.1.3. Inputs into a plan in the draft stage
5.2. Updates. Plans Offices need to review their plans annually to ensure currency. Areas of
consideration when reviewing plans are:
   5.2.1. Reference currency. All instructions, regulations, manuals, etc. which are referenced
   as resources in a plan should be checked to ensure it reflects the latest version, the document
   has not been rescinded, has not been replaced, or has not been renamed. Whenever reference
   changes, the plan OPR needs to check the content applicable to the plan to ensure its
   accuracy. For example, when AFI 10-2501 was released in January 2007, it significantly
   changed the concept of a Wing’s incident management structure and associated terms.
   5.2.2. Higher Headquarters changes, to include restructuring, new concept implementation,
   and doctrine changes, may need to be reflected in a Wing’s plans. For example, when
   FEMA released NIMS (National Incident Management System), followed by the HAF
   releasing AFIMS (Air Force Incident Management System), it impacted a significant number
   of AF, MAJCOM, State, and Wing plans.
5.3. Rewrites. Air Force policy is that if 20% or more of a plan changes, then a rewrite is
required. The same concept for inputs applies to rewrites, but on a much larger scale.
   5.3.1. A rewrite requires extensive research to ensure all elements of the plan reflect current
   doctrine and guidance. The OPR is responsible for the basic plan, but the functional area
   representatives need to provide information for the annexes and portions of the functional
   area taskings.
   5.3.2. A plan that has been updated with changes does not need to go through the entire
   approval process; however, a plan that is rewritten will be treated the same as a new plan.

                                            Chapter 6

                                      BRIEFING PLANS

6.1. Briefing Requirements. Most plans are required to be reviewed and briefed to Wing
leadership on an annual basis. Plans should state how often they should be reviewed and briefed;
if they do not, and then the plan should be reviewed and briefed on an annual basis.
   6.1.1. Secret plans can be briefed in an unsecure room as long as no classified portions of the
   plan are included. Refer to the security section of each plan for details.
   6.1.2. Briefing a plan is the responsibility of the designated plan OPR, since they are the
   subject matter experts. In situations where the OPR is not at the Wing level, such as AF,
   MAJCOM, and State plans, the Chief of Wing Plans has the obligation to brief them. Most
   of the HHQ plans briefs should be kept very short, since there are few specific taskings at the
   Wing level. These taskings generally follow the AF, MAJCOM, NAF, and Combatant
   Commander taskings.
   6.1.3. The Chief of Wing Plans should design and maintain a briefing tracking sheet.
       6.1.3.1. The tracking sheet should list the last review and briefing dates and when the
       next ones are due.
       6.1.3.2. The Chief of Wing Plans should coordinate the briefing schedule between the
       Commander and the briefers using the tracking sheet to ensure the briefings are annotated
       and timely. Once scheduled, a timely reminder to both the briefer and the Commander
       would be advantageous.
   6.1.4. The Chief of Wing Plans should instruct the plans briefers on the format to use and
   what information should be included.
6.2. Briefing format. The format, length, and scope for Wing briefings is at the discretion of
the Wing Commander; however, the purpose of the briefing is to remind the Commander and
his/her staff that the plan exists, for what situation it’s used, and what role the Wing and its
members play in the plan.
   6.2.1. A commander may want just the basics of a plan for situational awareness, which
   could take only a few minutes or a detailed analysis of the plan, which would take
   considerable time. The Chief of Wing Plans will confer with the Wing Commander to
   determine the level of detail he/she wants in a plans briefing.
   6.2.2. The basic elements of a plans briefing should be, but are not limited to:
       6.2.2.1. Purpose of the plan
       6.2.2.2. When it should be implemented
       6.2.2.3. Who is tasked in the plan
       6.2.2.4. Brief synopsis
   6.2.3. The briefings presented by the OPRs should be in the same format. The amount of
   content should also be consistent for all briefings, unless requested by the Commander.
 28                                                                ANGI10-400 2 APRIL 2014


                                           Chapter 7

                                      JOINT PLANNING

7.1. Overview. The ANG Wing works in concert with other services and agencies. Joint
planning is important for emergency and contingent operations for situations involving sister
services (Army, Coast Guard, Navy, etc.) and civilian emergency agencies (FEMA, State and
local Emergency Management Agencies). The Wing Planner needs to be familiar with these
agencies, their plans, and provide input into the development of these plans.
7.2. Integration. Wing operational assets and capabilities are not automatically considered or
included in other organization’s plans. It is up to the Wing Planner to ensure these organizations
are provided input into their plans.
   7.2.1. In 2006, the Air Force implemented the Air Force Incident Management System
   (AFIMS), based on FEMA’s National Incident Management System (NIMS). One of the
   results was the significant 2007 rewrite of AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management
   Program Planning and Operations. This implementation required many of the plans each
   Wing owns to be changed based on the new guidance for incident management. The key
   benefit of these changes is that Wing Planners will be using the same command and control
   structure and verbiage as their sister service and civilian counterparts. Wing Planners must
   ensure that Wing plans are IAW and reflect AFIMS guidance and mandates.
   7.2.2. Wing Planners need to ensure their State Joint Force Headquarters (JFH) are aware of
   and have included ANG in their plans for joint domestic operations capabilities, resources,
   and assets for emergency response to domestic situations such as terroristic actions, major
   accidents, and natural disasters.
   7.2.3. The JFH is the State’s link to their State Emergency Management Agency, which, in
   turn, provides input into FEMA. To ensure effective integration of capabilities, the Wing
   Planners should:
       7.2.3.1. Identify State and Agency objectives and determine manpower, equipment, and
       support capabilities that the Wing can provide.
       7.2.3.2. Contact State Planners and provide inputs that can be readily inserted or
       integrated into State plans.
   7.2.4. Planners need to make sure that Wing plans reflect the actions identified in State
   plans. When reviewing Wing plans, ensure they do not conflict with or contradict State
   plans.
7.3. Domestic Operations. National Guard assets have been used to assist emergency agencies
in the aftermath of natural disasters and since the September 11, 2001 attacks on our nation,
National Guard assets have been used to protect our country and our population.
   7.3.1. Each State should have a National Guard Military Support Plan which provides
   support to civilian authorities in time of emergency or disaster, usually written by State
   Planners at JFH. State Planners are often Army and non-rated Air Guard personnel who may
   know little about aircraft operations (with the exception of their helicopter assets).
ANGI10-400 2 APRIL 2014                                                                    29


     7.3.1.1. Operations Planners need to provide input into this plan concerning the mission
     capabilities of the unit’s airframe.
     7.3.1.2. Logistics Planners need to provide support capability information and ensure the
     State Emergency Support Functions (ESFs) reflect available Air personnel and equipment
     resources.

                                          Chapter 8

                                PLAN IMPLEMENTATION

8.1. Generating Plans. Wing plans are an essential tool for preparing for and executing actions
for expected and unexpected situations. Wing Planners cannot anticipate every situation, so
there are times when they may be called on to write a plan that currently doesn’t exist. These
plans should not be written generically, but for the express purpose of implementing the plan as
soon as it is finalized and approved by the Wing Commander.
   8.1.1. Adaptive Planning. When a real-world contingency arises, as it did for Desert
   Shield, OEF, OIF, and Hurricane Katrina, a Wing may be tasked to deploy in support of the
   contingency. The Plans Officer will most likely receive a WARNORD, CONOPs, OPORD,
   and/or EXORD.
       8.1.1.1. The Wing Plans Officer may be tasked immediately with writing a Wing
       OPORD based on the unit tasking, time permitting. Since only certain UTC’s may be
       tasked, a tailored OPORD may be necessary to identify the scope of operations for unit
       personnel to follow.
       8.1.1.2. The Planner must use all available resources, which may include:
           8.1.1.2.1. Operational Orders or Concepts of Operations
           8.1.1.2.2. Applicable HAF plan
           8.1.1.2.3. MAJCOM OMNIBUS
           8.1.1.2.4. Wing Mobilization Plan or BUS
           8.1.1.2.5. Any applicable off-the-shelf Wing plan
           8.1.1.2.6. Theater Reporting Instructions
           8.1.1.2.7. Theater Special Instructions (SPINS)
   8.1.2. Functional Planning. Wing Planners may be tasked with generating a local plan for
   a planned event or situation. It may require the creation of a comprehensive OPLAN or basic
   OPORD.
       8.1.2.1. An example of a Wing functional plan may be when a base decides to conduct
       an air show. While not mandated by AF Instruction, the Wing Commander may task the
       Wing Plans Office with generating a plan that details complex air show operations and
       tasks unit members in the preparation and execution of the event. The plan may task
       functional area OPRs with generating sub-plans or annexes such as a security plan,
       parking plan, communications plan, etc.
       8.1.2.2. An example of a basic OPORD might be in support of a base-wide exercise.
       The focus wouldn’t be so much on actions during the exercise, which would be tasked in
       the OPLAN, but rather the real-world preparation and actions required to support the
       exercise, which would not be in the OPLAN.
ANGI10-400 2 APRIL 2014                                                                         31


8.2. Implementing a Plan. Plans are implemented at the direction of the Wing Commander.
It’s imperative that when a situation occurs requiring the Wing or Wing members to respond, the
Chief of Wing Plans advise the Commander on which plan to use.
   8.2.1. The Chief of Wing Plans will be available to guide the Commander and his/her staff
   through the implementation of a directed AF, MAJCOM, State, or local operations plan. The
   OPR for any Wing plan should be available to advise the Wing leadership on the plan, if
   possible. If the OPR is required to perform other tasked functions, then the Chief of Wing
   Plans will act as the plan advisor.
   8.2.2. Wings can expect that not all plans will go as planned and unexpected circumstances
   may arise that are not included in a plan. Plans are guides from which to conduct operations
   and can be deviated from in situations that are not covered. It is the Commander and the
   Senior Staff who will determine when to deviate from a plan.
8.3. Validation. All plans should be tested for effectiveness, whether on a small scale or large,
by validating them through the use of exercises on an annual basis.
   8.3.1. The Chief of Wing Plans should work closely with the Exercise Evaluation Team
   (EET) to plan base exercises in order to:
       8.3.1.1. Ensure the plan is effectively exercised.
       8.3.1.2. Ensure the courses of actions in the exercise scenario reflect the actions outlined
       in the respective plans.
   8.3.2. Following each exercise, the OPR for the exercised plan should analyze the after-
   action report for any changes in the plan.
       8.3.2.1. Look for action steps that are unnecessary, outdated, or should be accomplished
       by someone else.
       8.3.2.2. Identify action steps or responsibilities that should be added to the plan.
   8.3.3. The exercised plan OPR should incorporate any changes into the plan that would
   improve its effectiveness.

                                          Chapter 9

                                 WING PLANS TRAINING

9.1. Formal Training.
   9.1.1. CWPC. The Contingency Wartime Planning Course (CWPC) is the only established
   Air Force training course for Plans Officers, which is offered by the Air University at
   Maxwell AFB, MS. It gives a thorough understanding of the plans cycle at the HAF and
   MAJCOM level and all the planning tools available for the MAJCOM planner. The course,
   however, currently does not address the roles and responsibilities of the Wing Plans Officer
   at the unit level on a day-to-day basis.
9.2. Computer-Based Training (CBT). To understand National Emergency Management
operations, it is highly recommended that Wing Planners take the CBT courses on emergency
management offered on-line by FEMA through Texas A & M. The following courses, focusing
on domestic operations, are available at http://www.teexwmdcampus.com:
   9.2.1. WMD 006a, MGT 101 –WMD Incident Management/Unified Command Concepts
   9.2.2. AWR 111, Basic EMS Concepts for WMD Incidents
   9.2.3. AWR 112, Public Works for WMD Incidents: Basic Concepts
9.3. Self-Initiated Training. Wing Plans Offices should maintain a continuity book outlining
the roles and responsibilities, resources available, and list of local plans, with which a new
Planner should become familiar. In the event a Wing’s Plans Office does not have a continuity
book and the previous Wing Plans Officer is no longer available, the new Wing Planner will
need to conduct self-initiated training. A recommended course of action in this case is to:
   9.3.1. Attend the CWPC at Maxwell AFB.
   9.3.2. Enroll in the FEMA on-line CBTs.
   9.3.3. Contact the Wing’s MAJCOM A3X Division to inquire if a Plans Conference has
   been scheduled.
   9.3.4. Familiarize themselves with AFIMS, AFI 10-2501, AFI 10-402V1, and AFI 10-403.
   9.3.5. Read AFI 10-401 and AFMAN 10-401V2.
   9.3.6. Read the Wing CEMP 10-2.
   9.3.7. Review all plans the Wing maintains.
   9.3.8. Benchmark off other units’ Wing Plans Offices to learn different planning tools and
   techniques.
9.4. Enhancement Training. There are periodic opportunities for Wing Planners to take short
TDY tours anywhere from 30 to 90 days (or longer) at MAJCOMs, NAF’s, or the Pentagon
working with HHQ planners. These opportunities will give the Wing Planner HHQ experience
in the anatomy of a Plan’s cycle and will provide HHQ with the insight of a Planner at the Wing
level. Positions can be inquired upon through the Plans Divisions at HHQ. Planners can also go
to the Volunteer Reserve System (VRS), which is linked through the ANG and AFRC websites,
where individuals can see what short tours are available by AFSC, rank, and location.
ANGI10-400 2 APRIL 2014                                                                       33


                                           Chapter 10

                                   ADDITIONAL DUTIES

10.1. Overview. The Wing Plans Officer position can be filled by either a full-time or
traditional part-time member. Traditional members will most likely not have additional duties,
except for administrative tasks; however, full-time members will most likely be tasked with
duties other than, although usually associated with, plans duties.
10.2. Administrative. Some Wing Plans Offices are one-deep, others have a full staff with
administrative support. For those Plans Offices with administrative support, the Planners can
expect to perform the following duties:
   10.2.1. Write communications relevant to Wing Plans functions.
   10.2.2. Maintain and process unclassified and classified material IAW OPSEC and
   COMSEC directives.
       10.2.2.1. Maintains a correspondence file.
       10.2.2.2. Maintain a publication file and post changes as directed by HHQ.
   10.2.3. Maintain status charts of held plans.
   10.2.4. Ensures operability of equipment
   10.2.5. Maintains supplies.
10.3. Project Management. Due to the nature of the position, a Wing Plans Officer may be
tasked with various projects. Planning is an essential part of any project and a systematic
approach dramatically improves the chance of a highly successful project. After receiving a
project tasking, the Project Manager should:
   10.3.1. Determine the project objectives;
   10.3.2. Establish a plan of action for accomplishing the project;
   10.3.3. Identify the major tasks that must be accomplished to reach the objectives;
   10.3.4. Identify the resources needed and the resources available to include manpower,
   equipment, and support to execute the plan.
   10.3.5. Create an implementation plan, to include metrics to measure if the objectives have
   been accomplished.
   10.3.6. Present the plan to the tasking /individual office to ensure the course of action
   coincides with the desired outcome.
   10.3.7. Initiate the plan and complete the project.
   10.3.8. Publish the results in an after-action report, continuity binder, or other appropriate
   means as a reference for future project officers.
10.4. Associated Duties. Two additional duties that are closely related to the Wing Plans
Officer are that of the Installation Control Center (ICC) Director and the Exercise Evaluation
 34                                                                 ANGI10-400 2 APRIL 2014


Team (EET) Chief (or Deputy Chief). It is recommended the full-time Wing Plans Officer hold
one of these two positions; however, they should not be tasked with them both at the same time.
   10.4.1. The ICC Director used to be the Crisis Action Team (CAT) Executive Officer
   position, but when the AF released the ICC Enabling Concept, it did away with the CAT
   Exec and gave the position more duties and responsibilities. The AF ICC Enabling Concept
   document can be found on the AF Portal in the Emergency Management section. Besides
   being responsible for the macro-functions in the ICC, the ICC Director is responsible for:
       10.4.1.1. Communication flow into and out of the ICC.
       10.4.1.2. The ICC room or facility.
       10.4.1.3. Equipment and administrative support materials.
       10.4.1.4. Maintaining ICC checklists.
       10.4.1.5. Advising the Wing Commander and the Senior Staff on resources available in
       the ICC.
   10.4.2. The EET Chief plans, coordinates, and conducts base exercises as required in
   Chapter 7 of AFI 10-2501. Since exercises are primarily meant to validate and practice
   responding to established plans, the Wing Plans Officer is a strong candidate for this
   position. The EET Chief is responsible for:
       10.4.2.1. Writing or overseeing the writing of the Master Scenario Events List (MSEL).
       10.4.2.2. Coordinating the EET members.
       10.4.2.3. Initiates and monitors the exercise.
       10.4.2.4. Solicits inputs, feedback, and functional area reports in order to write the after-
       action report.

Terms
Aerial Port of Debarkation (APOD)—A station which serves as an authorized port to process
and clear aircraft (scheduled, tactical, and ferried) and traffic for entrance to the country in which
it is located. For AEFs, this will usually be the Forward Operating Location (FOL).
Aerial Port of Embarkation (APOE)—A station which serves as an authorized port to process
and clear aircraft (scheduled, tactical, and ferried) and traffic for departure from the country in
which it is located.
Aerospace Expeditionary Force—Aerospace Expeditionary Forces (AEFs) are a composite
organizations of aerospace capabilities from which a tailored ASETF, composed of AEWs,
AEGs, and AESs, is created to provide forces to meet theater commander in chief (CINC)
requirements. An AEF is not a discrete warfighting unit.
Aerospace Expeditionary Wing (AEW)—An AEW is a Wing or a Wing slice assigned or
attached to an ASETF or an in-place NAF by MAJCOM G-series orders. Normally, the ASETF
or in-place NAF commander also exercises OPCON of AEWs. An AEW is composed of the
Wing command element and some groups. The AEW commander reports to a COMAFFOR.
ANG Shortfall—ANG has contacted all units (in and outside the current AEF pair and is unable
to meet their commitment.
Air Operations Center (DoD)—The principal air operations installation from which aircraft
and air warning functions of combat air operations are directed, controlled, and executed. It is the
senior agency of the Air Force Component Commander from which command and control of air
operations are coordinated with other components and Services. This is also called AOC.
(JP 1-02).
Airlift—Operations to transport and deliver forces and materiel through the air in support of
strategic, operational, or tactical objectives. (AFDD 1-02)
Air Refueling—The capability to refuel aircraft in flight, which extends presence, increases
range, and allows air forces to bypass areas of potential trouble. (AFDD 1-02).
Air Reserve Component (ARC) Shortfall—ANG is unable to fill the requirement and has
contacted AFRC who is also unable to fill the ANG requirement.
Command and Control (DoD)—The exercise of authority and direction by a properly
designated commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission.
Command and control functions are performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment,
communications, facilities, and procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing,
coordinating, and controlling forces and operations in the accomplishment of the mission. This is
also called C2. (JP 1-02).
Expeditionary Aerospace Force (EAF)—The EAF concept is how the Air Force will organize,
train, equip, and sustain itself by creating a mindset and cultural state that embraces the unique
ANGI10-400 2 APRIL 2014                                                                        39


characteristics of aerospace power – range, speed, flexibility, precision – to meet the national
security challenges of the 21st Century.
Joint Force Air Component Commander (DoD)—The joint force air component commander
derives authority from the joint force commander who has the authority to exercise operational
control, assign missions, direct coordination among subordinate commanders, redirect and
organize forces to ensure unity of effort in the accomplishment of the overall mission. The joint
force commander will normally designate a joint force air component commander. The joint
force air component commander’s responsibilities will be assigned by the joint force commander
(normally these would include, but not be limited to, planning, coordination, allocation, and
tasking based on the joint force commander’s apportionment decision). Using the joint force
commander’s guidance and authority, and in coordination with other Service component
commanders and other assigned or supporting commanders, the joint force air component
commander will recommend to the joint force commander apportionment of air sorties to various
missions or geographic areas. This is also called JFACC. (JP 1-02).
Joint Force Commander (DoD)—A general term applied to a combatant commander, sub
unified commander, or joint task force commander authorized to exercise combatant command
(command authority) or operational control over a joint force. This is also called JFC. (JP 1-02).
Lead Unit—MAJCOMs will designate a lead unit when the forces placed on call come from
more than one location. The Lead Unit works closely with the parent MAJCOM who directs the
planning and coordination efforts of designated AEF units to determine operational, logistics,
and support requirements to meet mission objectives.
Limiting Factor (DoD)—A factor or condition that, either temporarily or permanently impedes
mission accomplishment. Illustrative examples are transportation network deficiencies, lack of
in-place facilities, mal-positioned forces or materiel, extreme climatic conditions, distance,
transit or over-flight rights, political conditions, etc. (JP 1-02).
Maximum (aircraft) on the Ground (MOG)—The maximum number of aircraft that can be
accommodated at one time at a specific location due to limitations of ramp space, servicing
capabilities, cargo handling, or other considerations.
Pre-Positioning—Pre-positioning refers to movements that take place prior to receipt of a CJCS
Warning/Alert Order. Pre-positioning normally refers to equipment and supplies. Exception: The
HQ AMC TACC commander may (pre)position air refueling forces (aircraft and crews) in
anticipation of a Warning/Alert Order. Depending on the nature of the contingency, this will
facilitate the timely movement of other positioning/deploying forces.
Positioning—Positioning refers to movements that take place after receipt of a Warning/Alert
Order but prior to the Execute Order. Positioning normally refers to aircraft, aircrews, and MSTs.
Reach-back—The process of obtaining products, services, and applications or forces,
equipment, or materiel from Air Force organizations that are not forward deployed (AFDD 2,
AFDD 1-2). This capability allows commanders to obtain or coordinate support from units not
physically located with the forward force. By leveraging advances in communications
technology, reach back capabilities make it possible to utilize CONUS and/or rear-based assets
and organizations to perform various functions in support of AEF operations. Effective use of
reach back will reduce the number of personnel and amount of equipment which deploys to the
AOR, reduce airlift and support requirements, and will positively impact a commander’s ability

to protect the deployed force. Reach back is predicated on global communications, rapid global
mobility, and time-definite resupply capabilities.
Reach between—Reach between, or en route communication, provides services and capabilities
to ensure continuous command and control and information support for deploying forces. For
deploying forces, en route communication starts upon departure from garrison field and
continues until arrival in the AOR or at the FOL. For power projection and supporting missions,
en route communication starts upon departure from garrison or FOL and continues until return to
the respective recovery base. The goal of en route communication is to provide timely
information updates for improved situational awareness and command and control from
deployment to employment.
Search and Rescue (DoD, NATO)—The use of aircraft, surface craft, submarines, specialized
rescue teams, and equipment to search for and rescue personnel in distress on land or at sea.
(DoD) Also called SAR. See also combat search and rescue; combat search and rescue mission
coordinator; component search and rescue controller; isolated personnel; joint combat search and
rescue operation; joint search and rescue center; joint search and rescue center director; rescue
coordination center; search and rescue mission coordinator. (JP 1-02)
Special Operations (DoD)—Operations conducted by specially organized, trained, and
equipped military and paramilitary forces to achieve military, political, economic, or
informational objectives by unconventional military means in hostile, denied, or politically
sensitive areas. These operations are conducted across the full range of military operations,
independently or in coordination with operations of conventional, non-special operations forces.
Political-military considerations frequently shape special operations, requiring clandestine,
covert, or low visibility techniques and oversight at the national level. Special operations differ
from conventional operations in degree of physical and political risk, operational techniques,
mode of employment, independence from friendly support, and dependence on detailed
operational intelligence and indigenous assets. Also called SO. (JP 1-02).
Surveillance (DoD, NATO)—The systematic observation of aerospace, surface or subsurface
areas, places, persons, or things, by visual, aural, electronic, photographic, or other means. See
also air surveillance; satellite and missile surveillance; sea surveillance. (JP 1-02)
Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) (DoD)—The AMC direct reporting unit responsible
for tasking and controlling operational missions for all activities involving forces supporting
USTRANSCOM’s global air mobility mission. The TACC is comprised of the following
functions: current operations, command and control, logistics operations, aerial port operations,
aero medical evacuation, flight planning, diplomatic clearances, weather, and intelligence. (JP 1-
02) The TACC is AMCs single link between customers and operational units. The TACC plans
all AEF inter-theater mobility missions through HQ AMC TACC/XOP and XOOK, and provides
C2 within 24 hours of scheduled takeoff through HQ AMC TACC/XOC. (Following receipt of
an AEF Warning or Alert Order, TACC becomes the sole point of contact for AEF deployment
coordination.) See also Tanker Airlift Control Element.
Tanker Airlift Control Elements (TALCE) (DoD)—A mobile command and control
organization deployed to support strategic and theater air mobility operations at fixed, en route,
and deployed locations where air mobility operational support is nonexistent or insufficient. The
TALCE provides on-site management of air mobility airfield operations to include command and
control, communications, aerial port services, maintenance, security, transportation, weather,
ANGI10-400 2 APRIL 2014                                                                      41


intelligence, and other support functions as necessary. The TALCE is composed of Mission
Support Elements (MSEs) from various units and deploys in support of peacetime, contingency,
and emergency relief operations on both planning and “no notice” basis. TALCEs are tailored
based on projected requirements. For sustainment operations, personnel sourced from mobility
units should replace the TALCE.
Time-phased force and deployment data (TPFDD) (DoD)—The Joint Operation Planning and
Execution System data base data base portion of an operation plan; it contains time-phased force
data, non-unit-related cargo and personnel data, and movement data for the operational plan,
including:
(a)    in—place units
(b)—units to be deployed to support the operation plan with a priority indicating the desired
sequence for their arrival at the port of debarkation
(c)—routing of forces to be deployed
(d)—movement data associated with deploying forces
(e)    estimates of non—unit-related cargo and personnel movements to be conducted
concurrently with the deployment of forces
(f)    estimate of transportation requirements that must be fulfilled by common—user lift
resources as well as those requirements that can be fulfilled by assigned or attached
transportation resources. (JP 1-02)
Task Force (DoD, NATO)—1. A temporary grouping of units, under one commander, formed
for the purpose of carrying out a specific operation or mission. 2. Semi-permanent organization
of units, under one commander, formed for the purpose of carrying out a continuing specific
task. (JP 1-02)
Wing Level Shortfall—The Wing responsible for filling a rotation has contacted all their units
(including GSUs) and is unable to fulfill the requirement.
