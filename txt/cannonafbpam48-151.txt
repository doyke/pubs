1. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES.
    1.1. 27th Special Operations Wing Commander (27 SOW/CC) will enforce base
    compliance with this program to ensure the health and safety of all personnel on Cannon
    AFB.
    1.2. 27th Special Operations Medical Group Commander (27 SOMDG/CC) will be the
    final authority for thermal stress conditions for release to Cannon AFB Notices to Airmen
    (NOTAMS).
    1.3. 27 SOAMDS/SGPB, Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) will:
       1.3.1. Ensure heat stress guidance is available to shop personnel through Air Force
       Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) inspections at the shop level.
       1.3.2. Ensure the WBGT instrument is calibrated and available for daily use from 1 April
       to 1 October. The WBGT instrument will be deployed during normal duty hours Monday
       through Friday (except holidays or wing down days) when the ambient temperature is
       forecast to reach or exceed 85ºF and in support of exercises at the request of
       commanders.
       1.3.3. Determine the heat category and flag color in accordance with Tables A2.1. and
       A2.2. and report this information to the 27 SOW Command Post as changes occur.
       Because the available guidance was developed according to the wear of the hot weather
       BDU, one degree will be added to the WBGT reading at all times to account for normal
       ABU wear. The hot weather ABU is now available and will reduce heat exposure.
       Because not all Airmen wear the hot weather ABU, BE will make the assumption that all
       personnel are wearing the normal ABU.
       1.3.4. Investigate all thermal stress illnesses documented through the Air Force Safety
       Automated System (AFSAS).
       1.3.5. Ensure wind chill guidance is provided to shop personnel through AFOSH
       inspections at the shop level.
       1.3.6. During winter months, BE personnel will obtain outside ground temperature and
       wind speed from the installation weather office, determine the Wind Chill Temperature
       and Frostbite Risk Level and will notify the installation Command Post (784-2253) of the
       resulting Frostbite Risk Level. (Note: BE only notifies Command Post if a risk may be
       present or occur).
    1.4. 27 SOAMDS/SGPM, Public Health will:
       1.4.1. Provide thermal stress education and training on preventing and controlling heat
       induced illness and cold injuries, when requested.
       1.4.2. Track all thermal stress illnesses through AFSAS and report event to AFRESS II.
       NOTE: IAW AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy and Civil Liberties Program, records
       retrieved by name or personal identifier are subject to Privacy Act requirements.
    1.5. 27 SOW/CP, Command Post will:
       1.5.1. Relay and post the heat category and flag color to 27 SOW organizational
       commanders through appropriate means.

     organizations.
     1.8.2. Ensure wind chill guidance is implemented throughout the organization.
  1.9. Unit Fitness Leaders will:
     1.9.1. Determine whether physical training (PT) can be conducted outside during
     current weather conditions. Physical training leaders (PTLs) should consider
     conducting PT indoors when severe environmental conditions exist. Refer to AFI 36-
     2905, Fitness Program, Attachment 8, for environmental conditions required for PT
     testing. PT should not be conducted outside under the following conditions:

  1.10. Shop supervisors will:
     1.10.1. Routinely retrieve the thermal stress index from Command Post, and implement
     thermal stress safety procedures at shop level per Tables A2.1. and A2.2. Work center
     supervisors may have to adjust the work-rest cycles for operations that require heavy
     personal protective equipment.
     1.10.2. Ensure all employees are trained to recognize thermal stress disorders and
     administer first aid treatment according to AFPAM 48-151, Thermal Injury.
     1.10.3. Ensure employees are acclimatized in accordance AFPAM 48-151.

       1.10.4. Monitor weather information, especially for evening and night shift personnel,
       and implement precautions and work/rest cycles at the shop level per Table A2.1.
       1.10.5. Ensure workers wear cold protective clothing appropriate for the level of cold
       and physical activity at temperatures below 40ºF.
       1.10.6. Ensure gloves are worn or metal handles are covered with an insulating material
       when the ambient temperature is 30ºF or less.
       1.10.7. If heavy work is done (shoveling, etc.) encourage workers to change into dry
       clothing prior to re-entering a cold environment or going into a cold environment.
       1.10.8. Ensure workers handling evaporative liquids such as gasoline, alcohol or
       cleaning fluids at temperatures below 40ºF take special precautions to avoid soaking
       clothes or gloves due to evaporative cooling of the liquids.
       1.10.9. Brief shop personnel during fall and winter safety meetings on wind chill factors
       and follow the guidance provided in Tables A3.1., A3.2. A3.3. and A4.2.
       1.10.10. If a worker becomes immersed in water or their clothing becomes wet,
       encourage him/her to change clothing immediately and seek treatment for hypothermia.
       1.10.11. Report all thermal stress illnesses/injuries to 27 SOMDG/SGP at DSN 681-7801
       during duty hours and contact the on-call Flight Surgeon’s Office after duty hours
       (contact through the Command Post).
    1.11. Work center employees will:
       1.11.1. Understand the signs and symptoms of thermal stress, and the associated first aid
       treatments.
       1.11.2. Report all thermal stress illnesses to the work center’s supervisor.
2. MONITORING HEAT STRESS.
    2.1. BE will routinely monitor heat stress index during the summer months. The summer
    monitoring period will begin around Memorial Day and end around Labor Day. The summer
    monitoring period may be increased or decreased based on seasonal variations.
    2.2. When the predicted or forecasted outside temperatures reach 85ºF as a daily high, BE
    will perform heat stress monitoring at least four times during the hottest part of the day.
    Examples of monitoring schedules might be 1000, 1200, 1400, and 1600 or 0900, 1100,
    1300, and 1500. The heat category is determined by the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature
    (WBGT) Index. The WBGT Index is NOT related to typical civilian “heat indexes.” The
    WBGT Index is a combination of measurements, which take into account dry air
    temperature, relative humidity, and radiant heating. The Bioenvironmental Engineer has the
    field apparatus necessary to determine the WBGT Index.
    2.3. When the WBGT reaches 85ºF, BE will initiate heat stress monitoring hourly during
    normal duty hours. Tables A2.1. and A2.2. provide the Heat Categories, their corresponding
    WBGT Index range with corresponding color category, the recommended work/rest cycles
    (in minutes) and fluid intake guidelines.       The recommended work/rest guidelines are
    established to prevent adverse heat-related health effects, and represent conditions under
    which it is believed that nearly all un-medicated, healthy workers may be repeatedly exposed
CANNONAFBPAM48-151 23 OCTOBER 2013                                                         5


  without adverse health effects. The recommendations should not be used as a fine line
  between safe and dangerous levels, but should be used with good judgment concerning the
  working conditions and the individuals to ensure adequate protection for each situation.
  Table A2.3. provides examples of light, moderate, and heavy work referenced in Table A2.1.
  2.4. Bioenvironmental Engineering notifies the Command Post (784-2253) of the heat stress
  condition/flag conditions determined by the WBGT index. (Note: BE only notifies Command
  Post when flag conditions change.)
  2.5. The Command Post notifies Security Forces, Fire Department, Sports and Fitness
  Center, Maintenance Operations Control Center (MOCC), Cannon & Ranchvale Child
  Development Centers, Youth Center, Civil Engineering, Golf Course, Safety, and Public
  Affairs when flag conditions change.
  2.6. Public Affairs will update flag conditions on the base webpage, Facebook page, and
  other appropriate means.
  2.7. MOCC does an ALL-CALL and notifies all the maintenance production
  superintendents, Telford Aviation, Sierra Nevada, and Battle Space.
  2.8. Supervisor Actions:
     2.8.1. Supervisors should follow the guidelines in Table A4.1. if personnel show signs
     and/or symptoms of heat stress.
     2.8.2. Supervisors should be proactive with their work environment and work practices
     in order to help minimize the risk of heat stress.
         2.8.2.1. Engineering Controls: Engineering controls should be implemented as a first
         line of defense against heat stress. This will reduce the amount of heat to which an
         individual is exposed.
            2.8.2.1.1. General ventilation such as fans to move cool air around to produce
            convection can be installed.
            2.8.2.1.2. Evaporative cooling machines can be used outside to cool personnel
            working on the flightline and other outdoor locations.
            2.8.2.1.3. Air conditioning should be used to cool indoor work areas.
            2.8.2.1.4. Establish cool rooms and shaded areas to allow workers a place to take
            breaks.
            2.8.2.1.5. Use power tools when possible to reduce manual labor.
         2.8.2.2. Work Practices: When personnel have to work in hot environments,
         supervisors must implement work practices to prevent heat stress disorders.
            2.8.2.2.1. Use the work/rest cycles and fluid intake recommendations in Tables
            A2.1. & A2.2.
            2.8.2.2.2. Ensure personnel are trained to recognize and treat heat disorders and
            the actions to take in case of an emergency (see Table A.4.1).
            2.8.2.2.3. Organizations should schedule heavier workloads during cooler parts
            of the day, i.e., night or early morning.
6                                             CANNONAFBPAM48-151 23 OCTOBER 2013


               2.8.2.2.4. Personnel should pace themselves and try not to finish the work at a
               rapid pace.
               2.8.2.2.5. Assign extra workers to jobs if there are time constraints. Use relief
               workers to give individuals enough rest time. Personnel on medication or medical
               waiver may require additional rest periods because they are at greater risk for heat
               stress.
3. MONITORING COLD STRESS.
    3.1. The base weather office will post current weather conditions and forecasted weather
    conditions to include wind speed on SharePoint.
    3.2. During winter months, BE personnel will obtain outside ground temperature and wind
    speed from the installation weather office three times per week (Monday, Wednesday and
    Friday) at the end of the duty day. BE personnel will then determine the Wind Chill
    Temperature and Frostbite Risk Level (FRL) using Figure A3.1.
    3.3. BE will notify the installation Command Post (784-2253) of the resulting FRL. (Note:
    BE only notifies Command Post if a risk may be present or occur)
    3.4. The Command Post will notify Security Forces, Fire Department, Sports and Fitness
    Center, MOCC, Cannon & Ranchvale Child Development Centers, Youth Center, Civil
    Engineering, Golf Course, Public Affairs, and Safety when frostbite risks change.
    3.5. Public Affairs will update frostbite conditions on the base webpage, Facebook page, and
    other appropriate means.
    3.6. MOCC does an ALL-CALL and notifies all the maintenance production
    superintendents, Telford Aviation, Sierra Nevada, and Battle Space.
    3.7. Supervisor Actions:
       3.7.1. Supervisors should follow the guidelines in Table A3.3. if frostbite risks exist and
       Table A4.2. if personnel show signs and/or symptoms of cold injuries.
       3.7.2. Supervisors should be proactive with their work environment and work practices
       in order to help minimize the risk of cold stress.
           3.7.2.1. Engineering Controls: Engineering controls should be implemented as a first
           line of defense against cold stress.   This will reduce the degree of individual
           exposure.
               3.7.2.1.1. Heating systems and approved space heaters can be used to heat
               personnel.
               3.7.2.1.2. Establish warm rooms to allow workers a place to take breaks.
           3.7.2.2. Work Practices: When personnel have to work in cold environments,
           supervisors must implement work practices to prevent cold stress disorders.
               3.7.2.2.1. Use the work/rest cycles in Figure A3.2.
               3.7.2.2.2. Ensure personnel are trained to recognize and treat cold disorders and
               the actions to take in case of an emergency.
               3.7.2.2.3. Organizations should schedule heavier workloads during warmer parts
CANNONAFBPAM48-151 23 OCTOBER 2013                                                             7


              of the day.
              3.7.2.2.4. Personnel should pace themselves and try not to finish the work at a
              rapid pace.
4. WATER INTAKE. Water intake levels should coincide with BE recommendations in
accordance with Attachment 2, Tables A2.1. and A2.2., WBGT Stages, Temperature Ranges,
and Flag Colors.
5. PREVENTION MEASURES. The key to preventing thermal illness and/or injury is for
commanders, supervisors, and individuals at all levels to have an awareness of thermal risk
factors. Any training or task involving physical exertion in a hot or cold climate should be
considered a high-risk activity. Risk of illness and/or injury is based primarily upon
environmental conditions, work rate, and clothing worn. When there is a thermal casualty risk, it
is the commander’s duty to ensure that resources are available to undertake an appropriate risk
assessment and employ risk management actions. Commanders, supervisors, and workers will be
familiar with AFPAM 48-151 and the contents of this wing pamphlet for all thermal stress
related conditions.

WBGT—Wet Bulb Globe Temperature.

Terms
Acclimatization—A series of physiological adjustments, which occur when an individual is
exposed to a hot or cold climate. In simple terms, this is considered a break-in period to help
personnel slowly adjust to hot and cold environments.
Cold Injury—Cold environments pose a threat to the individual if they exceed the capacity of
the body’s thermo-regulatory response mechanisms. The main hazards are hypothermia
associated with a fall in the body’s core temperature and/or tissue damage that falls under the
broad headings of freezing cold injury (FCI) and non-freezing cold injury (NFCI). For the
purpose of this AFPAM the term ‘Cold Injury’ is all embracing and applies to an individual who
becomes incapacitated as the result of a drop in core body temperature, FCI or NFCI.
Heat Illness—Traditionally heat illness has been divided into heat exhaustion and heat stroke.
In practice the division is difficult to define, thus, for the purpose of this AFPAM the term ‘Heat
Illness’ is all embracing and applies to an individual who becomes incapacitated as the result of a
rise in core body temperature.
Heat Stress—The net heat load to which a worker may be exposed from the combined
contributions of metabolic cost of work, environmental factors (air temperature, humidity, air
movement, etc.) and clothing. In simple terms, heat stress is the body burden from these three
categories above.
Heat Stress Posting—Visual notification of heat stress flag conditions, work rest cycles and or
special personal protective equipment.
May—Indicates an acceptable or satisfactory method of accomplishment.
Should—Indicates a preferred method of accomplishment.
Thermal Stress—The common term used to cover both heat and cold stress.
Wet Bulb Globe Temperature— The WBGT is an instrument used to measure the heat stress
index.
Will—Indicates a mandatory requirement and is also used to express a declaration of intent,
probability, or determination.
Work/Rest Cycle—A guidance schedule for personnel to ensure adequate rest breaks are taken
to avoid heat stress disorders.
