                                            Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Suicide Prevention.
     1.1.1. Suicide Impact. Suicide is one of the leading manners of death (MOD) in the Total
     Force. Suicide diminishes our combat capability and has a tragic effect on units, families and
     the AF as a whole.
     1.1.2. Suicide Reduction. The AF strives to continuously reduce its suicide rate through a
     focus on development and implementation of constructive recommendations for suicide
     prevention. Key to developing and implementing these recommendations is the sustained
     study of data and lessons learned from actual events, evaluation of new prevention strategies,
     and active exchange with others who seek to reduce suicide in their communities. The
     Suicide Event Review Process prescribed in this instruction is one method AFGSC will use
     to study causes of actual suicides, to develop constructive, effective recommendations to
     reduce the suicide rate and to disseminate lessons learned.
1.2. Suicide Review, Analysis and Reporting.
     1.2.1. This instruction directs the processes and procedures AFGSC will follow in studying
     suicides and collecting information for use in prevention activities. These processes include
     data collection, post-suicide case assessments, collective analyses, and dissemination of
     useful findings and recommendations to the AFGSC community.
     1.2.2. For suicides of active duty or Air Reserve Component (ARC) members in Title 10
     status, data collection and post-suicide assessments will be completed by a Suicide Event
     Review Team (SERT) convened at the decedent’s installation. The purpose of this Suicide
     Review (SR) is to collect and report information to comply with the Department of Defense
     Suicide Event Report (DoDSER) requirements, provide contributing factors to the chain of
     command in order to improve unit and organization suicide prevention efforts, and provide
     AFGSC leadership with standardized reports for future trend analysis and suicide prevention
     program monitoring and improvement.
1.3. Suicide Surveillance.
     1.3.1. A Suicide Review (SR) will be conducted for the following populations:
        1.3.1.1. All active duty AF personnel assigned to AFGSC who commit suicide.
        1.3.1.2. All ARC personnel in Title 10 status who commit suicide.
     1.3.2. A DoDSER will be submitted (without a SR) on the following populations:
        1.3.2.1. All active duty AF personnel who attempt suicide.
        1.3.2.2. All ARC personnel in Title 10 status who attempt suicide.
        1.3.2.3. Active full time ANG personnel (Title 32) who commit suicide.
     1.3.3. Basic demographic data will be tracked on the following populations:
AFGSCI90-504 19 MARCH 2013                                                                        5


       1.3.3.1. All AF Department of Defense (DoD) civilian employee personnel who commit
       suicide.
       1.3.3.2. All Selected Reserve (SELRES) and traditional ANG members who commit
       suicide while in civilian status or during a Unit Training Assembly.
   1.3.4. A SR is not required for suicide attempts or for the completed suicides of civilian and
   reserve populations not in Title 10 status.
       1.3.4.1. A SR may be conducted on suicides by civilians and reserve members not in
       Title 10 status at the discretion of the AFGSC/CV.
1.4. Manner of Death (MOD).
   1.4.1. The Office of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner (OAFME) will make initial and
   final determinations regarding likely manner of death IAW Department of Defense
   Instruction (DoDI) 5154.30, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology Operations. All events
   classified as suicides or possible suicides will be treated as suicides for the purposes of this
   instruction.
       1.4.1.1. The Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), in conjunction with
       other law enforcement agencies, the coroner, medical examiner, and OAFME, is
       responsible for investigating the manner of death (natural, accidental, homicide, suicide
       or undetermined) for on base deaths and AF members in active federal status. The
       primary focus of AFOSI’s criminal investigation is to determine whether the death was
       the result of foul play.
       1.4.1.2. For ARC members not in federal (Title 10) status and civilian personnel, local
       civilian authorities are responsible for assessing the extent to which criminal activity is a
       concern in the deaths. Local medical examiners will make the determination regarding
       the likely manner of death.
   1.4.2. If during the course of a SR it is determined by OAFME that the manner of death was
   not suicide, then the SERT will stand-down and transfer all data gathered to the appropriate
   DoD component or AF organization.
   1.4.3. In cases in which the MOD cannot be determined based on the physical evidence the
   AFOSI may request that a psychological autopsy be conducted. A psychological autopsy is a
   specialized forensic evaluation of evidence and statements conducted by a specially trained
   mental health provider for the express purpose of assisting the medical examiner in
   determining the MOD. The need for a psychological autopsy will be determined by AFOSI
   and OAFME IAW DoDI 5154.30 and will not be a routine part of the SR process.
1.5. Exceptions to the Scope of Instruction.
   1.5.1. Suicide versus mishap. Applicable DoD and AF guidance governing safety
   investigations take precedence over this instruction if an event is determined to be a mishap
   rather than a suicide or suicide attempt, IAW AFI 91-204.
   1.5.2. Suicide versus crime. AFOSI’s criminal investigation will always take precedence
   over this instruction. DoDI 5505.10, Investigation of Noncombat Deaths of Active Duty
   Members of the Armed Forces, states, “All noncombat deaths of members of the Armed
 6                                                            AFGSCI90-504 19 MARCH 2013


     Forces on active duty, not medically determined to be from natural causes, shall be
     investigated as potential homicides until evidence establishes otherwise.”
1.6. Coordinating with investigative agencies and investigation boards. In most situations,
SERTs will function concurrently with official investigations or other inquiries and, therefore,
their activities require coordination to avoid disruption and duplication of effort.
     1.6.1. AFOSI death investigations take precedence over the SR and normally will be
     initiated prior to the SR process. Accordingly, some of the SR data will be obtained from
     those ongoing investigations. Any indication of foul play or criminal activity uncovered
     during the course of the SR will be referred to AFOSI.
     1.6.2. Medical quality assurance reviews conducted under Title 10 USC §1102, including
     Medical Incident Investigations (MII), Root Cause Analyses (RCA) and Standard of Care
     (SOC) reviews will be accomplished independently from the SR. Information from these
     reviews may be shared with the SERT on a limited basis as is necessary to meet the intent of
     the SR. SERT members will work with the MTF quality office on the appropriate release of
     information. SERT members will not be investigators in the MII, RCA or SOC reviews.
     Waiver can be granted by the Military Treatment Facility (MTF) commander or Convening
     Authority if conflict of interest is not a concern.
     1.6.3. If during the course of the SR the Team Lead (TL) believes that problems in medical
     care may have contributed to the suicide, the TL will refer this information to the MTF
     commander and MAJCOM/SG.
1.7. Discovery of harm to self, others or government property. IAW Chapter 4 of this
instruction, if during the course of its review the SERT discovers information suggesting the
threat of potential harm to a person or government property, the TL will contact necessary
emergency services to prevent harm to persons or property. If possible, SERT members should
avoid being part of any emergency response.
1.8. Protecting Health Information and Privacy.
     1.8.1. DoD 6025.18-R, DoD Health Information Privacy Regulation implements Public Law
     104-191, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy
     Rule within the DoD. Protected Health Information (PHI) is individually identifiable health
     information under the control of the covered entity which identifies or potentially identifies
     the patient; relates to the past, present or future health or condition, the provision of
     healthcare, or payment for the provision of healthcare for the patient.
     1.8.2. Suicide investigation and reporting requires disclosure of PHI from the covered entity
     (the military health system) to the SERT. This information is disclosed under the provisions
     of DoD 6025.18-R, paragraph C7.11.1. All disclosures of PHI to the SERT will be accounted
     for and must be kept to the minimum amount of information necessary to meet the need and
     intent of the disclosure. For questions on medical information release, consult with the local
     HIPAA Privacy Officer, installation SJA or Medical Legal Consultant.
     1.8.3. Protected Health Information that has been properly released to the SERT from the
     covered entity ceases to be protected by the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Information gathered
     from the patient or other sources is likewise not considered protected by the HIPAA Privacy
AFGSCI90-504 19 MARCH 2013                                                                     7


   Rule. Any use or further disclosures of the information by the SERT will be in accordance
   with the Privacy Act.
1.9. Information Protection/Privacy Act of 1974 and Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
   1.9.1. The SR presentation and case file may be subject to release determination under the
   Privacy Act and FOIA. For guidance on responding to such requests for disclosure of records
   see DOD5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302, Freedom of Information Act Program, and AFI 33-332,
   Air Force Privacy Program.
   1.9.2. In addition to the Privacy Act and FOIA, other statutes may authorize release of
   information. The disclosure or denial authority should consult the servicing Staff Judge
   Advocate (SJA) for guidance, as appropriate.
   1.9.3. The products of the SERT are for official us only (FOUO).
1.10. Confidential Information.
   1.10.1. Information Protected under Title 10 USC §1102. Medical quality assurance records
   created by or for the Department of Defense as part of a medical quality assurance program
   are confidential and privileged. Such records may not be disclosed to any person or entity,
   except as provided in subsection (c) of the statute. A SERT member is not an “officer,
   employee, or contractor of the Department of Defense who has a need for such record or
   testimony to perform official duties” under Title 10 USC §1102(c)(1)(E). This protection
   applies only to records, or testimony about records that was created as part of a medical
   quality assurance program. It is not a source of protection or confidentiality for all PHI.
   1.10.2. Chaplains and Attorneys. Chaplains and their assistants are prohibited from
   disclosing information obtained in the course of counseling an individual, to include whether
   the individual sought counseling. Similarly, attorneys and their assistants have a duty of
   confidentiality to clients which prohibits disclosure of information obtained in the course of
   representation, with limited exceptions. While a SERT may desire such information, the
   chaplain or attorney may not be able to divulge it. This would not preclude the SERT from
   using the same information gathered from independent sources.

                 DODSER AND DEMOGRAPHIC DATA COLLECTION

3.1. Data Collection when a SR is not required. A SR is not required for the categories listed
in paragraphs 1.3.2 and 1.3.3 of this instruction. However, available DoDSER required data and
other demographic data still must be collected. This is true for suicide attempts in which the
survivor may provide firsthand data regarding the event, and in some cases suicides and/or
suicide attempts involving members of the ARC. For ARC personnel it may not be possible or
appropriate to gather information beyond that present in existing military records or during a
voluntary or commander-directed mental health evaluation.
3.2. DoDSER Collection.
   3.2.1. AFOSI typically does not investigate suicide attempts and will not typically be a
   source for DoDSER information.
   3.2.2. The installation medical group commander will designate a mental health or medical
   officer to serve as the installation suicide prevention program manager, who will oversee
   compilation and entry of DoDSER data without a SR in cases of:
       3.2.2.1. All active duty AF personnel who attempt suicide.
       3.2.2.2. All federalized (Title 10) status ARC personnel who attempt suicide.
       3.2.2.3. Active full time ANG personnel (Title 32) who commit suicide.
          3.2.2.3.1. DoDSER data for ANG personnel should be completed based on existing
          data from military medical and personnel data.
          3.2.2.3.2. The installation suicide prevention program manager will coordinate with
          the ANG State/Territory Directors of Psychological Health (DPH) and the ANG unit
          to gather the necessary data regarding confirmed ANG suicides and complete the
          DoDSER within 60 days.
   3.2.3. The survivor’s unit and FSS will complete their sections of the DoDSER or data
   collection worksheet, found at http://afspp.afms.mil/, within 14 days of notification and
   provide them to the designated mental health or medical personnel.
   3.2.4. The mental health provider will attempt to identify individual or organizational issues
   that may have contributed to the suicide attempt. These observations will be documented in
   the biopsychosocial history section of the DoDSER.
   3.2.5. The complete DoDSER should be submitted within 30 days of the suicide attempt for
   active duty and 75 days for ARC.
   3.2.6. One DoDSER data field addresses whether the individual had been a victim of sexual
   assault. If the individual had made a report of sexual assault that was covered by DoDI
   6495.02, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program Procedures, this may be
   privileged information, and may need to be protected IAW DoDI 6495.02. Contact the local
   Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (SARC) and SJA regarding any disclosures of this
   information.
AFGSCI90-504 19 MARCH 2013                                                                   13


3.3. Demographic Data Collection. In some populations of interest to the AF, existing privacy
rules and lack of military jurisdiction in reviewing suicide incidents and determining causes of
death will make it impossible to complete a DoDSER. In these situations a standardized set of
basic demographic data will be collected by the installation suicide prevention program manager
to facilitate tracking of suicide trends within these populations using the Suicide Demographic
data form, found at http://afspp.afms.mil/. This process will be used for:
   3.3.1. All AF/DoD civilian employee personnel who commit suicide.
   3.3.2. All selective reserve (SELRES) members who commit suicide while in civilian status.
   3.3.3. When an ANG unit becomes aware of active full-time ANG individual in Title 32
   status who attempts suicide, the unit will report demographic data to the ANG/DPH.

                                          Chapter 5

                      SUICIDE REVIEW (SR) ADMINISTRATION

5.1. Convening Authority.
   5.1.1. The Convening Authority will be the Wing Commander of the decedent’s unit of
   assignment. If the decedent’s unit is a tenant unit located on the base of another MAJCOM,
   the tenant unit’s CC (in the grade of O-6 or higher) is the convening authority. The
   MAJCOM of the convening authority will manage the SR per their MAJCOM guidance.
      5.1.1.1. The convening authority will initiate a SR within 14 days of notification that
      suicide is a suspected cause of death. All cases which are considered possible suicides
      and are listed as “pending” by AFME will require initiation of a SR.
      5.1.1.2. In circumstances where the decedent was deployed or on temporary duty (TDY),
      the SERT will need to coordinate with other installations, units, and individuals. SERT
      member travel to other locations may be necessary to complete a full review of the case.
      5.1.1.3. The convening authority will appoint SERT members in writing. Letters
      appointing the SERT must contain the full name, rank/grade, organization, assigned base,
      and role for each appointed person. This letter will serve as authority to review evidence,
      interview witnesses, and obtain copies of records.
      5.1.1.4. Once the SR is complete, the convening authority will review the results and
      may accept the results as written, accept the results with comment, direct further review
      or in rare circumstances, convene a separate SERT to perform a second review.
      5.1.1.5. In cases where the convening authority is a tenant unit, the convening authority
      will ensure that relevant SR results are shared with the host installation commander.
5.2. SR Funding.
   5.2.1. All SR requirements are funded by the convening authority.
5.3. SR Timelines.
   5.3.1. The Convening Authority will initiate a SR within 14 days of notification that suicide
   is a suspected cause of death.
   5.3.2. DoDSER will be completed within 60 days of the date the event was initially
   determined to be a suicide for active duty service members and 90 days for guardsmen and
   reservists in title 10 status.
   5.3.3. SERTs will complete a PowerPoint presentation and submit it to the convening
   authority and to AFGSC/SG via SG Restricted Workflow within 60 days following the initial
   determination of a possible or suspected suicide.
   5.3.4. If a formal brief is requested by AFGSC/CV, the convening authority will work with
   AFGSC/SG to schedule the brief within 14 days following completion of the SR.
   5.3.5. In some cases the CSAF or VCSAF may request a suicide event brief, which may
   drive accelerated or delayed timelines.
AFGSCI90-504 19 MARCH 2013                                                                     17


   5.3.6. Extensions may be granted by the convening authority or AFGSC/CV. If extension is
   granted, the convening authority or TL will send a status update to AFGSC/SG.
5.4. Data Collection.
   5.4.1. Subject to the protections described in paragraphs 1.8 and 1.10, SERTs will collect
   information and data from existing sources (safety, personnel, medical, AFOSI, the
   member’s unit, police reports, etc.) to complete the DoDSER and produce the SR
   presentation.
   5.4.2. SERTs may, to the extent necessary to perform their responsibilities, and with the
   appropriate prior coordination discussed below, interview relevant individuals, including but
   not limited to, supervisors, co-workers, family and friends, to gain a clearer understanding of
   events leading up to the death. TLs must coordinate and receive prior permission from
   AFOSI before conducting any interviews when AFOSI is investigating a death.
   5.4.3. SERTs may also collect copies of documents pertaining to the death. All copies of
   documents will be destroyed or returned to the respective custodians of record after they are
   no longer needed by the SERT.
   5.4.4. SERTs will not collect physical “evidence” (clothing, weapons, medications, etc.).
   SERTs may request to review evidence held by other agencies. Permission to review
   evidence held by other agencies will be made on a case-by-case basis in consideration of
   whether foul play has or has not been ruled out, or whether safety issues (firearms, biohazard,
   etc.) are involved, etc.
   5.4.5. The SERT Mental Health member will gather copies of relevant (medical, dental,
   mental health, Family Advocacy, and Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment)
   records. This includes copies of all electronic records. The Mental Health member will
   ensure all medical information releases are kept to the minimum necessary to meet the
   requirements of the SERT.
   5.4.6. After coordinating with AFOSI, SERTs may interview individual witnesses to better
   understand relevant records, contributing factors, and the sequence of events leading to
   suicide.
       5.4.6.1. AF military members and civilian employees must cooperate with the SERT, to
       include being interviewed, unless they assert a legal right or privilege not to do so.
       5.4.6.2. Civilian employees (including non-appropriated fund employees) may have a
       right to union representation when interviewed. This right applies if the employee’s
       position meets the local definition for inclusion in the collective bargaining unit. The
       employee's individual status as a union member has no bearing on the right to
       representation. Before interviewing civilian employees represented by unions, consult
       with the JA and the Civilian Personnel Office to determine what, if any, rights may apply
       under the applicable collective bargaining agreement.
          5.4.6.2.1. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 created a right to union
          representation for federal civilian employees whose term of employment is governed
          by a union contract. This right arises during interviews with a federal employee in
          connection with investigations if: (a) the employee reasonably believes that
          disciplinary action may be taken against him or her as a result of the interview, and
18                                                        AFGSCI90-504 19 MARCH 2013


        (b) the employee requests union representation. The union has no right to have a
        representative present in the absence of a request from the employee. This right does
        not apply to management personnel.
        5.4.6.2.2. The Civil Service Reform Act does not require the TL to advise an
        employee of the right to union representation before an interview. The act merely
        requires management to inform its employees annually of this right. This reminder is
        frequently done in an installation's daily bulletin. However, some local union
        contracts have been negotiated where the management of an installation has agreed to
        provide notice before each interview. Therefore, TLs must exercise caution when
        interviewing federal employees to ensure they are not violating the terms of a local
        contract. TLs should contact the local Civilian Personnel Flight Labor Relations
        Specialist and JA to clarify the specifications of the local bargaining agreement.
        5.4.6.2.3. The exercise of the right to union representation may not interfere with the
        investigation. Determinations regarding union representation should be coordinated in
        advance with the JA. The representative may advise the employee, ask questions to
        clarify issues, and suggest other employees who may have knowledge of the facts at
        issue. However, he or she may not do so in a manner that interferes with the interview
        and may not testify for the employee. The TL has authority to terminate the interview
        if he or she determines the union representative is impeding or attempting to impede
        the investigation. Consult with the JA on how to proceed after terminating the
        interview.
     5.4.6.3. The SERT may invite other civilians (non-employees) to be interviewed, but
     may not compel an interview.
     5.4.6.4. If the SERT wishes to interview a contractor’s employee, the TL shall consult
     with the applicable Contracting Officer Representative or Contracting Officer to
     determine the proper method of contact to request the contractor’s permission in writing
     and contractor’s employee’s cooperation.
     5.4.6.5. The SR is not a criminal investigation. If the SERT suspects a witness may have
     committed a criminal offense, the interview must cease, and the TL should consult with
     the JA before continuing the interview.
     5.4.6.6. Witness interviews will not be recorded or transcribed. All interview notes
     should be marked “for official use only” and become part of the SR file.
     5.4.6.7. A hand off is required per CSAF's 26 November 2002 Policy for Investigative
     Interviews. This policy requires a person-to-person hand-off of distraught individuals
     following an investigative interview. The hand-off must take place between the TL and
     the individual’s commander or the commander’s designated representative. The policy
     applies to everyone, regardless of rank or position. If any interviewee appears to be
     emotionally distraught, or stunned during the process of any interview, they should not be
     allowed to depart alone, but should be released to their commander or designee, civilian
     leading an organization designated as a unit IAW AFI 38-101, Manpower and
     Organization, or designee, first sergeant, or supervisor, who will help ensure the
     individual receives the necessary support to safely handle his or her personal crisis
     (referred to as a hand-off).
AFGSCI90-504 19 MARCH 2013                                                                    19


          5.4.6.7.1. In most instances, hand-offs will require pre-coordination and advanced
          planning.
          5.4.6.7.2. The TL should also explain the reason for any concern he or she has about
          the individual’s personal safety (e.g., individual was emotionally distraught, shocked,
          etc.).
          5.4.6.7.3. During the hand-off, the TL should only disclose information necessary to
          ensure the individual’s safety. The TL should limit disclosure regarding the substance
          of testimony or other evidence obtained during the investigation.
          5.4.6.7.4. The hand-off must be documented at the end of the interview notes.
   5.4.7. SERTs shall consult the JA and AFOSI prior to retrieving any electronic
   communications created, received or maintained by the decedent.
   5.4.8. The final SR presentations are maintained and filed by AFGSC/SGPW. All other
   copies are to be destroyed as per appropriate AFI defined procedures.
5.5. Controlling Information Collected by the SERT.
   5.5.1. AFGSC/CC, or designee, is the release authority for all records created by the SERT
   during its review. Records created by the SERT will be released only IAW the FOIA,
   Privacy Act, or other release statutes and implementing instructions or regulations.
   5.5.2. If the SR is suspended or terminated, all information/evidence will be transferred to
   the agency assuming primary responsibility for the case.
   5.5.3. All documents containing Privacy Act information will be marked appropriately IAW
   AFI 33-332.
   5.5.4. Prior to the release of any SR information or briefing under FOIA, the initial denial
   authority will consult the local SJA IAW DOD5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302.
   5.5.5. All pertinent information should be included in the SR presentation and all notes and
   drafts destroyed after approval of the final presentation by the convening authority.
   5.5.6. Given the sensitivity of these documents, SR materials should only be shared with
   those who have a legitimate need to know, and these disclosures should be kept to the
   minimum amount of information necessary to meet the needs of the SERT. Documentation
   should be labeled as FOUO as outlined in chapter 7 of this instruction.
   5.5.7. Electronic transmission of the SR documents should ensure the information is
   provided only to those with a need to know, and be encrypted prior to transmission, and
   marked IAW AFI 33-332.

                                            Chapter 6

                          CONDUCTING THE SUICIDE REVIEW

6.1. SERT Considerations.
   6.1.1. Because suicide is, by its legal definition, an intentional act, the SERT should assume
   that each decedent made an intentional decision. The SERT’s job is to determine the factors
   which contributed to the decision and enabled the decedent to act on that decision.
   6.1.2. The SERT will begin by reviewing the questions listed on the DoDSER data
   worksheets at http://afspp.afms.mil/. Addressing these questions will provide both an initial
   understanding of the event as well as a basis for determining additional information required
   to identify factors contributing to the decedent’s decision and factors affecting their ability to
   act on this decision.
   6.1.3. The SERT should develop a factual chronological timeline of the sequence of events
   leading up to the death.
   6.1.4. The SERT will evaluate factors that may have contributed to the decedent’s death and
   factors which may have helped prevent it. This may require the collection of additional
   information beyond that covered in the DoDSER.
   6.1.5. SR briefing will not use names or other identifying information whenever possible.
   This document should make reference to the “the decedent,”“the spouse,” “the supervisor,”
   and “witness1,” etc., as appropriate.
   6.1.6. The SERT will identify the necessary history of the decedent, timeline of events
   leading up to the death and analysis of the event sufficient to support any recommendations.
6.2. Determining and Documenting Risk Factors.
   6.2.1. Each risk factor may represent an essential element in explaining the event sequence
   that led to the suicide.
   6.2.2. Identification of risk factors is based on the weight of evidence, professional
   knowledge, and good judgment.
      6.2.3. Risk factors can occur long before the suicide with such things as childhood
      trauma or pre-service mental health issues, but may also include more recent events such
      as substance abuse, financial problems, pending disciplinary or legal action, relationship
      problems and/or social isolation.
   6.2.4 Ensure critical events contributing to the act of suicide have not been omitted.
   Conversely, do not include events interesting to the reader, but not necessary to explain the
   event.
   6.2.5. Do not include people’s names, call signs, names of AF bases, or companies in the
   findings. Use more generic terms such as “decedent,” “the spouse”, the supervisor,” etc.
   This applies to the whole presentation.
6.3. Determining and Documenting Recommendations.
AFGSCI90-504 19 MARCH 2013                                                                     21


  6.3.1. The SERT will develop recommendations to mitigate findings and/or risk factors, in
  order to prevent future suicides. Recommendations must be feasible and effective solutions
  to decrease the likelihood that a similar instance of self-directed violence will occur in other
  AF members.
  6.3.2. SERT feedback should include recommendations to help mitigate factors that may
  contribute to suicides. If no recommendations are made, the SERT will explain its rationale
  in the presentation.
  6.3.3. Ensure the data supports the recommendations. It is essential to stay focused on the
  circumstances of the case. Do not make recommendations for the sole purpose of having
  recommendations.
  6.3.4. When the decedent was a member of a tenant organization, the recommendations
  should clearly state whether they apply to the host installation or the unit of assignment.
  6.3.5. All recommendations should target one or more of the finding or risk factors. It is
  also sometimes prudent to make several recommendations for each finding/risk factor, so as
  to increase options.
  6.3.6. Recommendations may vary in scope. Some actions can be taken at unit or base level.
  Other recommendations require action by MAJCOM or other agencies.
  6.3.7. General, vague, sweeping, or open-ended recommendations that cannot be
  implemented by the installation, MAJCOM, AF, DoD, or other government agencies are not
  appropriate.
  6.3.8. Do not recommend briefing personnel on the event. Such a briefing and its use are a
  basic command responsibility.
  6.3.9. Do not recommend reminding (or CC’s reminding/briefing) personnel of the
  importance of simply doing their jobs properly. Recommendations for specific actions such
  as additional or refresher training may be appropriate if they reflect specific interventions
  that can be completed.
  6.3.10. Number recommendations consecutively and precede each number by the word
  "Recommendation."(e.g., Recommendation 1, Recommendation 2, etc.). Include only one
  statement for each recommendation. Rather than sub-grouping recommendations (e.g., 1a,
  1b, 1c, etc.) use a new recommendation number.
  6.3.11. Determine the appropriate action agencies for each recommendation.

                                            Chapter 7

                                     SR PRESENTATION

7.1. SR Presentation.
   7.1.1. The formal PowerPoint slide deck will consist of the following:
      7.1.1.1. Biopsychosocial assessment.
          7.1.1.1.1. Demographic data.
          7.1.1.1.2. PRP Status.
          7.1.1.1.3. Relevant medical history and current diagnoses.
          7.1.1.1.4. Mental Health history.
          7.1.1.1.5. Substance use history.
          7.1.1.1.6. Detailed history of prior suicide attempts or other self-directed violence.
          7.1.1.1.7. Family history.
          7.1.1.1.8. Educational history.
          7.1.1.1.9. Occupational history.
          7.1.1.1.10. Significant relationship history and current status.
          7.1.1.1.11. Legal/Administrative issues.
          7.1.1.1.12. Financial issues.
          7.1.1.1.13. Detailed history of other impulsive or risk taking behaviors.
          7.1.1.1.14. Description of the event.
      7.1.1.2. Unit/organizational factors.
      7.1.1.3. Chronological time line of events.
      7.1.1.4. Actions taken by leadership to respond to the event to include status of
      DoDSER.
      7.1.1.5. Key findings, risk factors and/or barriers to services which may have mitigated
      those factors.
      7.1.1.6. Lessons learned and recommendations.
      7.1.1.7. Details that may still be outstanding such as toxicology, autopsy or police
      reports.
   7.1.2. The presentation must focus on pertinent information, such as sequence of events, risk
   factors, lessons learned, and actions taken. Due to time constraints, AFOSI may not have a
   final report available; orally presented preliminary investigative findings will suffice. Do not
   speculate. If information is insufficient to answer a question, then document it as such. If
   facts emerge later that alter the SERT’s conclusions, a follow-up report is appropriate.
   7.1.3. The following are examples of key issues to consider in preparing the slide deck.
AFGSCI90-504 19 MARCH 2013                                                                      23


       7.1.3.1. Have all risk factors been reviewed (e.g., alcohol/drugs, illness, family matters,
       relationship issues, adverse actions, deployment/work stress, social interactions, etc.)?
       7.1.3.2. Was the member referred to Mental Health (command-directed, medically
       referred, or self-referred)? Did the member receive mental health services after the initial
       evaluation? What were the recommendations from Mental Health? Medical conditions?
       Medications?
       7.1.3.3. Did the member have a history of disciplinary actions or investigations? Was the
       member informed about the Limited Privilege Suicide Prevention Program?
       7.1.3.4. Did the member have a support network (e.g., friends, church, co-workers)?
       7.1.3.5. Did the member portray a sense of hopelessness? Did anyone notice and if so,
       what actions were taken?
       7.1.3.6. Did the member perceive themselves as a burden to others? What evidence do
       we have to support this?
       7.1.3.7. Was there evidence of rehearsal or other behavior used to help the member
       overcome fear of death?
       7.1.3.8. Did other military or civilian personnel have concerns regarding the mental
       health or safety of the member? Did they share these concerns with appropriate Air
       Force or civilian authorities/medical personnel?
       7.1.3.9. Were weapons used in the incident?
       7.1.3.10. When and where were weapons obtained?
7.2. Distribution of SR Presentation.
   7.2.1. All email containing the SERT brief will be encrypted.
   7.2.2. The TL will forward the SR presentation to the Convening Authority and AFGSC/SG
   via SG Restricted Workflow.
   7.2.3. AFGSC/SG will review and forward the presentation back to the TL and Convening
   Authority with comments and/or recommendations.
   7.2.4. Once the TL and Convening Authority have agreed on a final product, the
   presentation will be forwarded back to AFGSC/SG via SG Restricted Workflow.
   7.2.5. AFGSC/SG will forward final presentation to the AFGSC/CV for review and
   disposition.
       7.2.5.1. Disposition by AFGSC/CV will generally include, “no further action,” “forward
       lessons learned and recommendations to CAIB Chairs for action,” or “request formal
       brief.”
   7.2.6. If the CSAF or VCSAF requests a formal suicide event brief, the presentation will be
   sent back to the Convening Authority and TL in preparation for the brief.
7.3. SR Briefing.
   7.3.1. Straightforward cases that do not require discussion or clarification can be approved
   by AFGSC/CV without the need for a formal brief.
 24                                                         AFGSCI90-504 19 MARCH 2013


   7.3.2. If a formal brief is requested by AFGSC/CV, SG will work with the Convening
   Authority to schedule the brief within 14 days following completion of the SR.
   7.3.3. The TL will conduct the formal briefing and may brief cases via VTC unless
   otherwise directed.
   7.3.4. The audience will be limited and will generally include SERT members, the deceased
   member’s chain of command (CC/CCC/CCF) at the Squadron, Group, Wing, and NAF, and
   at the MAJCOM the CC, CV, CCC, CCF, DS, A1, JA, OSI, HC, SG, SGPW. Additional
   attendees may be directed by the AFGSC/CC.
      7.3.4.1. “Read ahead” materials will be forwarded to attendees no later than 5 days
      before the scheduled brief.
   7.3.4.2. Additional suicide event briefings may be required at the request of the CSAF or
   VCSAF.
7.4. Lessons Learned and Tracking.
   7.4.1. AFGSC/SG will forward lessons learned and recommendations to the CAIB Chairs
   and CAIB Executive Directors, once approved by the AFGSC/CV.
   7.4.2. The CAIB at each level is responsible for coordinating all recommendations within its
   scope of authority. This includes researching and assigning proposed action agencies (Office
   of Primary Responsibility (OPR) and Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR)).
   7.4.3. Normally, if a recommendation requires funding to effect changes, the office
   responsible for such funding will serve as OPR. If a particular agency only provides funds
   for the effort and other organizations are responsible for performing or managing the work,
   assign these organizations as OCRs.
   7.4.4. Sometimes the responsibility for a recommendation lies outside the AF. Since the AF
   may not have the authority to task such agencies to perform recommended actions, do not
   assign non-AF agencies as OPRs or OCRs. In these cases, write the recommendation as an
   AF action and assign the appropriate AF organization as OPR. This AF organization is
   typically responsible for interaction with or contractual oversight of the outside agency and
   will ensure proper recommendation evaluation and disposition.
   7.4.5. The OPRs for each open item will provide quarterly updates to the CAIB. The CAIB
   will track the items within its scope of responsibility until closure.
