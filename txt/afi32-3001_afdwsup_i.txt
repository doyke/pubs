     establish EOD team contact procedures.
        1.5.1.1. (Added-AFDW) EOD flight will maintain a 24-hour standby capability. Flight
        leaders will determine when in-shop standby is required.
     1.5.2. Provide Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) access within the EOD
     facility. SIPRNET is required for ACES reporting and access to EOD emergency response
     files, which in turn is required to fulfill DoD-directed IED statistical analysis and
     environment-related data analysis on UXO response and destruction.
     1.5.3. EOD personnel are not exempt from additional duties (e.g., bay orderly); however,
     commanders should limit EOD personnel involvement in additional duties if the duties will
     negatively affects individual proficiency and team capabilities. EOD will not be included in
     programs such as Security Forces augmentation program, escort programs, READY
     program, and other Squadron duties requiring constant maintenance/monitoring.
        1.5.3.1. (Added-AFDW) EOD technicians require extensive certification, reoccurring
        and ancillary training to stay current on EOD emergency response procedures. Because
        of this EOD personnel will not be assigned to full or part-time additional duties that
        interfere with their primary mission as described in this instruction and supplement.
     1.5.4. Commanders over EOD flights are encouraged to participate in the following EOD
     activities:
        1.5.4.1. Receive an EOD mission briefing within 90 days of arrival.
        1.5.4.2. Attend the EOD VIP course at Eglin AFB, FL as soon as possible after arrival.
        1.5.4.3. View an EOD demolition or emergency response operation every 6 months.

     1.6.3. Destroy explosive ordnance (EO) according to all local, state, Federal, and host nation
     environmental, health, and safety requirements. To facilitate off-base emergency response
     actions, EOD Flights should establish, in coordination with the installation environmental
     offices, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with their State agency responsible for
     environmental quality. See Attachment 2 for a sample MOU.
AFI32-3001_AFDWSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                                            15


  1.6.4. Prior to performing EOD procedures, response teams must positively identify and
  verify all ordnance in EOD technical data. If no technical data exists for the item in question,
  then other means will be used to identify ordnance. For example: x-rays can help identify
  what type of filler is inside the ordnance and the type of fuzing. There are two resources for
  ordnance information:
     1.6.4.1. Requests for information to aid in identification of unknown ordnance can be
     sent to the NAVEODTECHDIV thru Det 63 (1-301-744-6824, DSN 354).
     1.6.4.2. The Technical Support Center (TSC) is available at 1-877-EOD INFO (1-877-

  1.6.5. Perform initial on-site detection and point detection at the assumed source for known
  CBRNE materials during IED, suspect package, bomb threat and munitions responses when
  CBRNE hazards are indicated. CE Readiness will perform any follow-on support for
  CBRNE detection necessary after explosive hazard is negated. May perform gross
  decontamination on munitions and IEDs after they are rendered-safe and leak-sealed.
  1.6.6. Support Federal and Joint Service EOD taskings (i.e., United States Secret Service
  (USSS), VIP protection teams, and Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command taskings) and
  issue official passports to each EOD individual.
  1.6.7. Ensure personnel meet the requirements for demolition duty pay and document
  monthly qualifications.
  1.6.8. Provide Explosive Ordnance Reconnaissance (EOR) training to base populace when
  directed by AOR specific directions.

Section 1B—Personnel

1.8. Administration of EOD Personnel:
     1.8.1. Qualifications. EOD Personnel must meet the requirements in the Officer
     Classification Directory and Enlisted Classification Directory respectively, and must be
     assigned to a valid EOD position on a Unit Manning Document (UMD) to perform EOD
     duties.
     1.8.2. Proficiency. EOD personnel must maintain competency in all aspects of the EOD
     mission. Completion of the minimum training requirements listed in the 3E8X1 Career Field
     Education Training Program (CFETP), Section G; AF EOD Standard Training Package, is
     required to maintain proficiency.
     1.8.3. Removal from EOD duties and the EOD flight. Because of the nature of EOD duties
     (working with live explosives and providing protective support to Presidential and State
     Department personnel), Airmen may be removed from EOD duties and the flight when their
     reliability and judgment are called into question. Removal from EOD duties by itself is
     neither an adverse personnel action nor the basis for disciplinary action. When making a
     removal determination, the issue is not an individual‘s guilt or innocence of a particular
     offense. It is not necessary to complete an investigation, take disciplinary action, or to
     complete other personnel actions before determining to remove an individual from EOD
     duties.
AFI32-3001_AFDWSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                                          17


       1.8.3.1. Removal may be appropriate based on a single serious incident or habitual minor
       incidents, reflecting behavior that is inconsistent with military standards and raises
       questions about an individual‘s reliability and judgment. Any of the following may result
       in suspension of duties and/or removal from the flight.
          1.8.3.1.1. Any alcohol-related incident, alcohol abuse, or alcohol dependency.
          1.8.3.1.2. Significant delinquent financial obligations.
          1.8.3.1.3. Negligence or delinquency in performing duties that reveals a lack of
          dependability, flexibility, good attitude or good judgment.
          1.8.3.1.4. Arrest or conviction by a military or civilian court, or non-judicial
          punishment action, of a serious offense, including both felonies and misdemeanors, or
          involvement in a serious incident or pattern of behavior or conduct that is reasonably
          indicative of a contemptuous attitude toward the law or other duly constituted
          authority.
          1.8.3.1.5. Any significant physical or medical condition determined to be prejudicial
          to reliable performance of EOD duties.
          1.8.3.1.6. Poor attitude or lack of motivation as evidenced by aberrant or irrational
          behavior, inappropriate behavior or mood.
          1.8.3.1.7. Failure to maintain a proper grade/skill relationship.
       1.8.3.2. Establishment of a Security Information File or suspension of access to
       classified information will result in temporary removal from EOD duties and the flight.
       Revocation of security clearance eligibility will result in disqualification from EOD
       duties and removal from the flight.
       1.8.3.3. When the conditions described in section 1.8.3.1 occur, commanders may take
       the following actions:
          1.8.3.3.1. Temporary removal from duties and the EOD Flight. Immediately suspend
          an individual for up to 180 days in order to determine whether, given the nature of the
          incident(s), the individual‘s reliability and judgment meet the standards for
          reinstatement to EOD duties.
          1.8.3.3.2. Permanent disqualification of an individual from EOD duties. Situations
          such as the following are grounds for permanent disqualification: confirmed drug
          abuse, a diagnosis of alcohol dependence, pending involuntary discharge or removal
          for cause, a diagnosed psychiatric disorder that interferes with member‘s ability to
          perform military duties, imposition of non-judicial punishment, pending court-martial
          charges and/or conviction, pending civilian criminal felony or misdemeanor charges
          and/or conviction. Commanders should seek legal advice before permanently
          removing an individual from EOD duties.
Note: Permanent disqualification of an individual from EOD duties may include removal of the
EOD qualification duty badge. Submit recommendations for removal through EOD MAJCOM
functional staff to HQ AFCESA/CEXD for determination.
          1.8.3.3.3. Reinstatement. A commander may request reinstatement of an individual‘s
          qualification for EOD duties provided the reason or condition of the permanent
18                                                   AFI32-3001_AFDWSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009


             disqualification no longer exists. Forward all requests for reinstatement to HQ
             AFCESA/CEXD. The request will include chain of command recommendations and
             all documentation that substantiated the permanent disqualification and
             documentation that supports the opinion that the condition or reason no longer exists.
        1.8.3.4. Appeal. An individual may appeal a permanent disqualification. Individuals
        must provide a written request for an appeal with rationale. Forward all appeal requests to
        HQ AFCESA/CEXD for approval or disapproval. The request will include chain of
        command recommendations and all documentation that substantiated the disqualification
        determination.
     1.8.4. Interruption in EOD duties. EOD Personnel must reaccomplish the basic EOD course
     when they have been assigned 48 months or longer in a non-EOD position or if there is a 36-
     month or longer break in service. Under extenuating circumstances (i.e., if special EOD
     training or operations were accomplished during that time), this requirement may be fulfilled
     if the individual can be recertified on all CFETP Core Tasks (commensurate with grade/skill
     level), and attend the Advanced IED Defeat course.
        1.8.4.1. For active duty forces the AF EOD Career Field Manager, in consultation with
        the responsible MAJCOM, has waiver authority for this requirement on a case-by-case
        basis.
             1.8.4.1.1. The individual‘s prior service EOD history will be evaluated to ensure the
             individual is qualified for EOD duties, meets criteria listed in Officer/Enlisted
             Classification Directory, and meets Air Force Quality Standards.
             1.8.4.1.2. Waiver authority for ARC forces is delegated to the ARC EOD Functional
             Managers.
     1.8.5. Re-training: EOD cannot accept enlisted Airmen above the rank of SSgt for retraining
     without case-by-case approval of the EOD Career Field Functional Manager. EOD
     operations require experienced technical leadership. 1
     1.8.6. Incentive Pay. This section outlines service component requirements in compliance
     with DoD 7000-14-R, DoD Financial Management Regulation, Volume 7A, Military Pay
     Policy and Procedures – Active Duty and Reserve Pay.
        1.8.6.1. EOD personnel in a valid EOD position receiving demolition pay must
        document monthly qualifications.
        1.8.6.2. During periods of deployments and at locations where monthly qualification is
        not possible, MAJCOM functional managers may temporarily waive this requirement.
        See paragraph 3.11.1.2.

  Limiting re-training to E-5s provides for an approximate 10 year experience/growth into flight management and
team leadership; additionally, it parallels requirements for civilian supervision of explosive operations (DDESB
technical paper 16) and US Army EOD TTP that calls for E-6 squad leaders.
AFI32-3001_AFDWSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                                          19


Section 1C—Manning

1.9. Operational manning requirements.
   1.9.1. Deployment coding. All EOD flight members will be coded DWS or DXS. Ten
   positions (20 positions for large range flights at Eglin, Hill, Luke, and Nellis AFBs) on each
   EOD flight UMD will be coded DXS, all others will be coded DWS. All AF EOD instructors
   (NAVSCOLEOD and Silver Flag) will be coded DXX. EOD Staff positions at HAF,
   AFCESA, MAJCOM and Det 63 will be coded DXS. All other EOD positions not addressed
   in this paragraph will be coded DXS. This paragraph does not apply to joint or classified
   EOD positions.
   1.9.2. Manpower Standard and Unit Personnel Management Roster (UPMR). The Air Force
   Manpower      Standard       (AFMS)       for     AF      EOD       is    AFMS       44ED
   (https://www.afma.randolph.af.mil/orgunits/MAS/AFMS/index.asp). It is a peacetime
   manning standard that structures our forces aligned with logical peacetime mission areas to
   support Homeland Defense and preparation for contingency support.
   1.9.3. EOD Flight Posturing. EOD Flights are primarily structured as large-range flights (60
   personnel), large force-projection flights (24 personnel), and small force-projection flights
   (18 personnel).
      1.9.3.1. USAF EOD minimum Sustainable manpower. Ten personnel, 20 at large range
      flights, are required to meet all mission area requirements identified in AFPD 32-30,
      Explosive Ordnance Disposal. This provides sufficient manpower structure to 1)
      maintain missions for an indefinite period of time; 2) provides the proper leadership &
      mentoring; 3) and maintain required training proficiency. Manpower includes: two 3-
      person teams, two supervisors and two operations personnel. Up to four of these
      personnel can be available to support VIPPSA and RST missions. The additional 10
      personnel at Large range flights are required to maintain emergency response for range
      operations. Support for scheduled range clearances, as outlined in AFI 13-212, Range
      Planning and Operations, Volume 1, will require manning augmentation from other EOD
      flights.
      1.9.3.2. USAF EOD minimum Break-the-Flight manpower. If, during surge or
      emergency operations, an EOD flight falls below Sustainable manpower, a degraded
      capability exists.
          1.9.3.2.1. A manpower structure of 6-9 personnel is only sufficient to provide limited
          mission areas support and only a single-incident response capability. An EOD flight
          can maintain this level of support for eight months. After eight months, the EOD
          flight must be rated C-3 (non-mission capable) until all Initial Job Qualification
          Standard (IJQS) tasks are recertified.
              1.9.3.2.1.1. (Added-AFDW) Only personnel returning from deployments longer
              than 180 day must be recertified on home station emergency response tasks
          1.9.3.2.2. Support for missions that are beyond emergency installation and force
          protection response (e.g., missions other than nuclear/strategic mission, force
          protection, and aircraft/munitions response) require critical operational risk
          management determination. At this level of manning, required training proficiency
20                                       AFI32-3001_AFDWSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009


        and certifications can not be maintained. Flights falling below 10 personnel (20
        personnel for large range flights) for periods longer than 30 days should request
        manning assistance through their respective MAJCOM functional manager.
            1.9.3.2.2.1. (Added-AFDW) Requesting Manning Assistance through HQ
            AFDW 7XD with requirements. Unit will be responsible for all per diem and
            travel
        1.9.3.2.3. (Added-AFDW) Each newly assigned person will be task qualified on all
        local procedures before being placed on standby duty.
     1.9.3.3. (Added-AFDW) Manning Assistance Participation. AFDW EOD personnel
     will not participate (volunteered or tasked) in other MAJCOMs/sister services manning
     support missions without prior HQ AFDW 7XD approval.
AFI32-3001_AFDWSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                                        21

91-501, Air Force Consolidated Occupational Safety Standard. EOD Flights must participate in
the following health and safety programs.
   2.5.1. Environmental Management System, Hazardous Communication (HAZCOM).
   2.5.2. Respiratory Protection Program.
   2.5.3. Blood Borne Pathogen (BBP).
       2.5.3.1. With use of established control procedures (use of personal protective equipment
       (PPE) and good hygiene); normal home-station EOD duties do not warrant participation
       in the BBP program.
       2.5.3.2. If local or deployed special EOD missions create a high potential for exposure to
       BBP, then EOD flights will coordinate with Bioenvironmental Engineering and Public
       Health flights to determine whether enrollment in this program is appropriate.
       2.5.3.3. Refer to Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 1910, subpart Z,
       Standard 1910-1030, Bloodborne Pathogens (29 CFR 1910-1030), for requirements on
       training and a written exposure control plan (see also the sample guides in the EOD
       Mortuary Support CONOP).
   2.5.4. As-Low-As-Reasonably-Achievable (ALARA).
   2.5.5. Hearing conservation.

                             OPERATIONS AND TRAINING / A3

Section 3A—Operational Parameters.

3.1. General Unexploded Ordnance Response Actions
     3.1.1. Positive Identification. Responding EOD teams must positively identify all ordnance
     items prior to performing any EOD procedures.
        3.1.1.1. All research and identification of ordnance items will be documented in EOD
        reports and verified as outlined in Para 3.8.1. If unable to identify the ordnance item the
        team must assume:
            3.1.1.1.1. It is the most hazardous type it could be.
            3.1.1.1.2. It has the most hazardous features/filler it could contain.
            3.1.1.1.3. It is in the most hazardous condition it could be in.
        3.1.1.2. EOD flights will put statements in their response guides that the team must
        positively identify ordnance using EOD technical data prior to performing any EOD
        procedures. If no technical data exists for the item in question, then other means will be
        used to identify ordnance. For example: x-rays could be used to help identify what type
        of filler is inside the ordnance and the type of fuzing or a request for information can be
        sent to the NAVEODTECHDIV thru Det 63.. The Technical Support Center, manned 24
        hours is a resource available for assistance at 1-877-EOD INFO (1-877-363-4636)
        3.1.1.3. (Added-AFDW) Notify HQ AFDW 7XD immediately upon request or
        completion of any response that requires emergency EOD action, i.e., render safe attempt
        of a suspect IED, any disposal deemed an emergency, any Level 1 or 2 response. After
        duty hours, contact HQ AFDW 7XD via e-mail. Transmit a brief note explaining the
        situation.
        3.1.1.4. (Added-AFDW) During EOD operations and training, flights are not
        authorized to employ demolition material, EOD equipment/supplies using explosives, or
        equipment controlling the initiation of explosives without approved technical data and
        Non-Nuclear Munitions Safety Board (NNMSB) approval. Det 63 AAC serves as the Air
        Force action office for approval of joint 60-series technical data and is responsible for
        development of preliminary technical data for Air Force unique EOD equipment and
        procedures. All preliminary technical data must be approved by AFDW A4/7XD before
        release to EOD Flights.
     3.1.2. EOD Technical Guidance. EOD procedures are conducted in accordance with Joint
     Service EOD 60-series Technical Orders (TOs). Supporting instructions such as 11-series
     TOs         or         DDESB          Technical         Papers         (available       at
     http://www.ddesb.pentagon.mil/techpapers.html) may be used in absence of 60-series
     guidance. Additionally, basic EOD emergency response guidance is provide in Attachment 3.
     Local commanders have the authority and responsibility to make operational risk
     management adjustment to established requirements so that mission requirements are met.
AFI32-3001_AFDWSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                                        25


  3.1.2.1. Deviations from 60N series can be made with coordination and approval with
  MAJCOM and 708th Nuclear System Squadron (708th NSS), Military Liaison Branch.
  During accident response, deviations from 60N are obtained through the Nuclear Weapon
  Accident Response Procedures (NARP) weapon recovery process. By design, 60N series
  publications do not address all potential accident/incident scenarios. During an accident
  situation EOD personnel in collaboration with DOE ARG will develop a weapons recovery
  plan incorporating pertinent paragraphs from specific weapon 60N series tech order.
  3.1.3. Medical support. Medical support during high-explosives operations is a mandatory
  safety requirement. Medical support must remain in a designated safe area unless required for
  injury/incident response. Medical support may be military, civilian, or contracted as long as
  the qualifications are current and time criteria are met.
     3.1.3.1. Explosives operations involving only practice munitions (other than demolition
     explosives): An Independent Duty Medical Technician (IDMT) or Emergency Medical
     Technician (EMT)-qualified technician must be available on-site or within a 30-minute
     response time. Trauma facilities should be available within 60 minutes via ground or air
     transportation.
     3.1.3.2. Explosives operations involving live munitions (other than demolition
     explosives): An IDMT-qualified technician must be available on-site during all
     operations. An IDMT provides capability to give Advanced Cardiac Life Support
     measures such as administering emergency intravenous medications. Trauma facilities
     should be available within 30 minutes via ground or air transportation. If not possible,
     then ensure a paramedic or emergency medical technician with current NREMT
     (National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians) certification is available on-
     range.
     3.1.3.3. EOD flights performing daily, multiple, simultaneous explosives operations
     involving live munitions should have an IDMT-qualified technician dedicated/assigned to
     the EOD flight. IDMT would be within 30-minute response time to all explosives
     operating sites. Supplement the IDMT with EMT-qualified technicians on-site at each
     operating site, e.g., one IDMT is centrally located within 30-minutes of the operations.
     Each operating site would have an EMT immediately available.
  3.1.4. Off-Installation Responses.
     3.1.4.1. Military munitions and explosives.
         3.1.4.1.1. The closest AF EOD flight is required to respond to accidents/incidents
         involving AF-owned EO on or off AF installations. The first service to discover an
         incident involving EO of another service or Federal agency must take immediate
         actions to prevent or limit damage or injury. Report incidents occurring in another
         service's operational area according to the procedures of the responsible service. The
         closest EOD flight should respond immediately with the understanding that the
         responsible service retains operational control. After DoD arrives on scene, the
         various services can sort out responsibilities per AFJI 32-3002.
         3.1.4.1.2. The first service to discover a transportation accident/incident involving
         federally owned or controlled EO must respond immediately, regardless of location.
         The EOD team should arrive on-scene as soon as possible (within 4 hours). Use the
26                                             AFI32-3001_AFDWSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009


            fastest mode of transportation available. The objective is to prevent or limit loss of
            life, injury, property damage, and minimize public inconvenience. Note: The first
            priority is an immediate response to the accident or incident. After DoD arrives on
            scene, the various services can sort out responsibilities per AFJI 32-3002.
        3.1.4.2. Non-military munitions and explosives.
            3.1.4.2.1. Civil authorities are primarily responsible for the safe handling and
            disposal of IED, nonmilitary commercial explosives, or similarly dangerous articles
            located off DoD installations. See details for off-installation support in paragraphs 7.2
            and 7.3.
            3.1.4.2.2. Non-DoD toxic or hazardous materials are not taken to military
            installations for storage or disposal unless:
               3.1.4.2.2.1. The situation is clearly an emergency or lifesaving operation.
               3.1.4.2.2.2. Formal agreements exist with other Federal agencies (e.g.,
               Memorandum of Understanding between DoD and the Bureau of Alcohol,
               Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives).
     3.1.5. Environmental Guidance. All Air Force EOD flights within the United States and its
     territories must comply with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) EPA
     Military Munitions Rule, and other state regulatory requirements. EOD Response Actions are
     conducted under authority of the ―DoD Policy to implement the federal EPA Military
     Munitions Rule (MRIP),‖ chapter 9, Emergency Response. The MRIP is very specific about
     the conduct of emergency response and EOD‘s authority to conduct them.
        3.1.5.1. In non-emergency situations, to ensure all legal requirements are met, EOD
        personnel must consult the Staff Judge Advocate and the installation Civil Engineer
        environmental management function before destroying EO (see paragraph 3.2 for
        emergency parameters).
        3.1.5.2. The federal EPA has established definitions for when munitions become a waste
        and requirements for management of waste munitions. These definitions and
        requirements are incorporated into RCRA‘s implementing regulations. The federal
        program exempts EOD from some environmental management requirements during an
        EOD emergency response action for munitions and other explosive devices (military and
        non-military). The degree of exemption from federal RCRA regulations depends upon the
        level of response. However, states may have more stringent requirements than the federal
        regulations.
        3.1.5.3. The Department of Defense has created two levels of EOD emergency response;
        immediate response (Level 1) and imminent and substantial endangerment (Level 2). The
        primary distinction between the two levels is that a Level 2 response can be delayed
        without compromising safety or increasing the risks posed to life, property, health, or the
        environment.
            3.1.5.3.1. Treat all requests for EOD response as a Level 1 response until determined
            otherwise. From an explosives safety point of view, when EOD technicians are
            dispatched, the situation requires an immediate response.
AFI32-3001_AFDWSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                                                       27


            3.1.5.3.2. The on-scene EOD technician determines if the situation requires a Level
            1, Level 2, or no EOD emergency response.
            3.1.5.3.3. Only the senior on-scene EOD technician can determine when the response
            action is complete. For a Level 2 response, temporary storage in a munitions storage
            facility should not terminate the emergency nature of the response – normally, wait
            for termination until final destruction or shipment to a destruction facility.
3.2. Explosives or Munitions Emergency Response: Level 1 emergency response actions are
exempt from RCRA permitting, DOT manifesting for movement to a safe disposal area, and
other substantive requirements under Title 40 CFR. 2 However, Level 2 emergency response
actions may be subject to emergency permitting and other requirements. When, during an
emergency response, applicable state law or an agreement requires, or the situation allows, the
installation environmental office will consult with environmental regulators on the need for
permits and fulfilling other requirements.
    3.2.1. Level 1 Emergency Response (Immediate Response). A Level 1 Emergency could
    occur anywhere. A Level 1 Emergency requires immediate response activities to eliminate or
    address the actual or potential imminent threat to life, property, health or the environment.
        3.2.1.1. A Level 1 Emergency exists if a delay in response activities would compromise
        safety or increase the risks posed to life, property, health or the environment. (Note: A
        reasonable delay in EOD's completion of an explosives or munitions emergency response
        that is caused by necessary, unforeseen, or uncontrollable circumstances does not
        automatically terminate a Level 1 Emergency.) A Level 1 Emergency may exist if:
            3.2.1.1.1. The risk associated with movement of the military munition or other
            explosives involved is unknown or not acceptable; or
            3.2.1.1.2. The risk associated with the military munitions or other explosives
            temporary storage, or careful movement beyond a nearby, more isolated and
            protected location for immediate rendering-safe or destruction, is not acceptable.
        3.2.1.2. The lead on-site EOD Technician will, with regard to any explosive or chemical
        agent hazard presented: (a) determine whether a Level 1 Emergency exists, and (b) when
        to terminate a Level 1 Emergency response, or reclassify it to a Level 2 response. Once
        the immediate hazards associated with military munitions or other explosives are
        eliminated, the supported installation or activity may have to perform other actions to
        address the impact of the response action. (See paragraph 3.2.3 below.)
        3.2.1.3. EOD-conducted response actions during a Level 1 Emergency could involve
        defuzing, detonation, or other actions to neutralize a munition ―in-place,‖ or careful,
        limited movement to a nearby, more isolated and protected location, including to an
        operational range used by or limited to EOD operations, to defuze, detonate, or otherwise
        abate the immediate threat.

        3.2.1.4. Level 1 emergency response actions, where the response cannot be delayed
        without compromising safety or increasing the risks posed to life, property, health, or the
        environment, are exempt from RCRA permitting, DOT manifesting for movement to a
        safe disposal area, and other substantive requirements.
            3.2.1.4.1. Level 1 EOD response actions are exempt from federal RCRA permitting
            requirements.
            3.2.1.4.2. Response may occur on-site or the item may be transported to a more
            secure location.
            3.2.1.4.3. No Hazardous Waste Manifest is required.
            3.2.1.4.4. Transporter of the item does not need a RCRA identification number.
            3.2.1.4.5. Item may be held in appropriate storage as a continuation of the response if
            a proper location for the response action is unavailable due to extenuating
            circumstances (e.g. adverse weather, nightfall, or other safety considerations).
            3.2.1.4.6. Storage location does not have to be a RCRA interim status or RCRA
            permitted facility or comply in any way with RCRA; however, it must comply with
            DDESB standards.
     3.2.2. Level 2 Emergency Response (Imminent and Substantial Endangerment). A Level 2
     Emergency also poses an actual or potential imminent threat to life, property, health or
     human health or the environment, but does not require immediate response activities to
     eliminate or address the actual or potential imminent threat. Level 2 Emergency response
     actions can generally be delayed for a reasonable period without adverse impact.
        3.2.2.1. A Level 2 Emergency exists if the response actions can be delayed without
        compromising safety or increasing the risks posed to life, property, health, or the
        environment. A Level 2 Emergency may exist if:
            3.2.2.1.1. The risk associated with movement and temporary storage of the military
            munition or other explosives involved is acceptable; and
            3.2.2.1.2. The military munitions or other explosives are positively identified, is safe
            for transport by explosives or munitions emergency response specialists, and can be
            stored (temporarily) within DoD's munitions logistic management system pending
            appropriate response action (e.g., on-site destruction or movement to an appropriate
            destruction facility).
        3.2.2.2. The on-site EOD Technician will, with regard the explosive or chemical agent
        hazard presented, determine: (1) whether a Level 2 Emergency exists; (2) when to
        terminate a Level 2 Emergency; and/or (3) when to re-classify a Level 2 Emergency (e.g.,
        risks become unacceptable) to a Level 1 Emergency. Once the immediate hazards
        associated with military munitions or other explosives are eliminated, the supported
        installation or activity may have to perform other actions to address the impact of the
        response action.
        3.2.2.3. The host installation's Environmental Office/Hazardous Waste Program
        Manager is responsible for consulting with environmental regulators to determine
        whether other regulatory requirements must be satisfied (e.g., a requirement to seek a
AFI32-3001_AFDWSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                                                                       29


         RCRA emergency permit under section Title 40 CFR Part 270.61) and to obtain requisite
         emergency transportation and/or treatment permits. Emergency permits are usually
         granted orally with written follow-up.
              3.2.2.3.1. Off-base response permits. EOD flights should pre-coordinate local/state
              off-base permitting procedures with the installation environmental office. Under
              normal circumstances;
                   3.2.2.3.1.1. If EOD is responding to a military munition, then request the
                   installation environmental office obtain necessary permits.
                   3.2.2.3.1.2. If responding to other than a military munition, then the civil
                   authorities requesting support are responsible for requesting the necessary
                   permits.
              3.2.2.3.2. For items turned-in to the munitions storage area, the munitions activity
              will immediately request the installation environmental office obtain the necessary
              permits and state notifications per local directives.
    3.2.3. Site Remediation. EOD personnel do not conduct planned munitions responses;
    however, they will respond to explosives or munitions emergencies that occur during planned
    responses. See paragraphs 3.5.6.2.2 and 3.5.6.2.3. 3 4 5
    3.2.4. Significant Disagreement. If, during an explosives or munitions emergency response,
    environmental regulators and safety officials have serious concerns about the potential
    impact of EOD's proposed course of action on human health and the environment the
    following applies:
         3.2.4.1. By DoD policy, EOD personnel are not allowed to take any action inconsistent
         with approved EOD procedures or that would place them at added risk.
         3.2.4.2. When a delay in conducting response activities will not compromise safety or
         increase risks, ensure protective measures are implemented until a mutually agreeable
         solution is reached.
         3.2.4.3. The environmental regulators or safety officials having serious concerns shall be
         requested to immediately elevate the concern to the next level of authority to attempt to
         achieve a mutually agreeable solution.
         3.2.4.4. Once an agreeable solution is attained, the appropriate DoD authority will
         coordinate EOD's support to resolve the emergency in a manner protective of human
         health and the environment, and that is consistent with EOD procedures.
    3.2.5. Response Records. Flights will maintain EOD response records and a copy of any
    supporting documentation such as an emergency permit (if issued) in the EOD Incident
    Management System (EODIMS) database.3 HQ AFCESA/CEXD manages the EODIMS per
    Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Table 33-49, Rule 20.01.


3
  Under 40 CFR §264.1(g)(8)(iv), the responding military emergency response specialists‘ unit must retain records for 3 years
identifying the dates of the response, the responsible persons within the unit involved, the type and description of material
addressed, and its disposition. The DoD Military Munitions Response Program requires retention of a permanent record of EOD
responses for future land restoration and remediation prior to release of DoD lands to the public.

     3.2.6. (Added-AFDW) Disposition of Unique, Dud, and Non-Stock-listed Munitions.
     Items "Found on Base" can include, but are not necessarily limited to:
        3.2.6.1. (Added-AFDW) Unique Military Items. Treat foreign munitions or explosives
        of unknown hazard/class division as HC/D 1.1L. If local munitions or EOD can identify
        "found on base" item sufficiently to determine that it is the same as stock listed, hazard
        classified items, they have the prerogative to store it in a segregated area within the
        munitions storage area. Items that cannot be sufficiently identified will be treated as a
        level 1 or level 2 incidents in accordance with the Military Munitions Rule.
        3.2.6.2. (Added-AFDW) Antique U.S. Military Items. These are still considered
        military munitions and will be managed as such. Munitions that can be correlated to a
        U.S. stock list number will be picked up on record by the MSA and an ADR will be
        processed through OO-ALC/LIW, Hill AFB.
        3.2.6.3. (Added-AFDW) Ground Burst Simulators (GBS), and Smoke Grenades.
        According to the Military Munitions Rule, military munitions used in training activities
        are not considered solid waste, and therefore not subject to Resource Conservation and
        Recovery Act (RCRA) requirements. This ―exemption‖ extends to the process of
        rendering safe dud-fired or suspect items. Dud-fired GBS and smoke grenades used
        during on-base exercises will be removed and treated as quickly as possible, but no later
        than 1 day after completion of the exercise. This ―exemption‖ may be limited by state
        regulation, and should be reviewed with base environmental personnel and the Office of
        the Staff Judge Advocate.
        3.2.6.4. (Added-AFDW) Civilian Munitions. Civilian munitions found on base will be
        turned into the base MSA for courtesy storage.
        3.2.6.5. (Added-AFDW) If the item is comparable to a stock listed military munition,
        the item will be picked up on record by the MSA and an ADR processed through OO-
        ALC/LIW, Hill AFB. EOD and munitions inspection personnel will determine if the
        item is comparable to a stock listed item.
        3.2.6.6. (Added-AFDW) If the item is not comparable to a military munition, it is the
        responsibility of the owning organization to coordinate an emergency disposal permit
        with the state through the base Civil Engineering Environmental office.
        3.2.6.7. (Added-AFDW) Ball-type ammunition .50 caliber and smaller is not
        considered reactive by the EPA and will not be treated as a reactive hazardous waste.
        3.2.6.8. (Added-AFDW) Fireworks.            The installation commander should have
        established procedures for disposing of confiscated fireworks; however a local DRMO
        contract may be the only option available. Coordinate with HQ AFDW/A7A for the
        latest information on disposal options. It is possible to request an emergency permit from
        the state, but that should not be considered the first option.
3.3. Planned Support: The U.S. Army has responsibility for routine or planned EOD
operations within the continental landmass. The exceptions to this policy occur when the EO is
located on installations, dispersal bases, assigned operational areas, or in the physical possession
of another service.
3.4. Contingency, Exercise, and Deployment (CED) Support
AFI32-3001_AFDWSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                                      31


  3.4.1. EOD Capability.
     3.4.1.1. The four elements required to provide a combat EOD capability are:
         3.4.1.1.1. Response vehicle and specialized equipment sets.
         3.4.1.1.2. Explosives and demolition material.
         3.4.1.1.3. Joint-service technical data and viewing/communications set.
         3.4.1.1.4. EOD-qualified personnel/teams.
     3.4.1.2. EOD UTCs must have the capability to be fully mobile on initial deployment
     into any contingency. This requires vehicles to be part of EOD equipment UTCs so that
     all equipment and explosives can be loaded on a vehicle for transport. An EOD capability
     does not exist without the ability to respond with necessary equipment, communications,
     and explosives.
  3.4.2. Core Unit Type Code (UTC). The Air Force uses EOD UTCs in peace and war to
  provide combatant commanders with an EOD capability. The WMP-1 provides details of
  required UTCs, support-levels, and structure for differing threat-levels. Flights should
  request current copies of the WMP-1, Annex S, Appendix 9 (EOD) from their wing level A5
  or MAJCOM representative.
     3.4.2.1. Each UTC has a Mission Capability Statements (MISCAP) that provides UTC
     limitations and capabilities (available on the AF EOD Program Management CoP at
     https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/EntryCoP.asp?Filter=OO-EN-CE-49).
  3.4.2.2. Core UTCs are designated as Lead and Base support. A Lead UTC can support one
  lead flying squadron for 24-hour operations without augmentation. Base-support UTCs
  augment additional missions and other non-tactical or notional requirements.
     3.4.2.3. (Added-AFDW) UTC Packing List Requirements. AFI 10-403 requires
     Packing Lists to be placed in individual kits listing the contents. Air Force EOD UTC
     load planning fulfills this requirement with the use of the Air Force EOD Equipment and
     Supply Listing (AFEODESL) and Illustrated Parts Breakdowns (IPBs). Printed copies of
     pertinent ESL and/or IPB information will be placed on or within individual kits as
     required.
  3.4.3. Joint EOD Operations.
     3.4.3.1. Refer to Joint service EOD Multi-service, Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
     (MTTP), Oct 2005, Appendix B, for the EOD Planning Checklist for Joint Operations
     3.4.3.2. A theater combat mission may best be supported by a joint EOD structure.
     Details for supporting joint EOD operations are in AF Tactics, Techniques, and
     Procedures (Interservice) (AFTTP(I)) 3-2.32, MTTP for EOD in a Joint Environment,
     Oct 2005.
  3.4.4. Employing/deploying recently graduated EOD Personnel.
     3.4.4.1. An EOD Apprentice (AF Specialty Code (AFSC) 3E831) is not deployment-
     eligible unless they have completed all requirements per paragraph 3.10.3.1.1.
32                                             AFI32-3001_AFDWSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009


            3.4.4.1.1. EOD Journeymen and Craftsmen will not be tasked to train our 3-level
            Airmen while directly supporting combat operations. To do so places our junior
            Airmen and the entire EOD team at increased risk of injury/loss of life.
            3.4.4.1.2. When possible, EOD Apprentices will be employed at locations with less
            risk where EOD persons with more developed experience and skills can train them
            prior to being assigned to locations of higher intensity.
        3.4.4.2. After graduation from EOD basic school, an EOD Officer (AF Specialty Code
        (AFSC) 32E H/K) is not deployment-eligible until they have completed eight months at
        home station (two months for AFPC rules of non-deployment and six months for
        qualification training per paragraph 3.10.3.1.2).

Section 3B—EOD Missions

3.5. Mission Areas. Each of the nine EOD mission areas listed in AFPD 32-30 are thoroughly
expanded and outlined in an AF EOD Concepts of Operation (CONOP), available electronically
from the AF EOD Program Management CoP. EOD flights use the guidelines provided in these
CONOPs to augment the general guidance offered below.
     3.5.1. Aerospace Vehicle Launch and Recovery. Supporting sortie generation and Space
     operations by responding to airfield emergencies to render safe ordnance and aircraft during
     in-flight and ground emergencies or crash situations.
        3.5.1.1. EOD personnel are not end-of-runway crews; however, they should be familiar
        with communicating with and operating around running fixed-wing and rotary-winged
        aircraft. Periodic (annual) training with these crews can be beneficial experience for EOD
        personnel.
        3.5.1.2. EOD teams respond when End-of-Runway crews or transient alert personnel are
        unavailable and/or when the aircraft/munitions system is in a hazardous condition.
        3.5.1.3. Refer to EOD Aerospace Vehicle CONOPs for more details.
     3.5.2. Force Protection. Eliminating or mitigating explosive hazards created by known or
     suspected criminal and terrorist devices.
        3.5.2.1. EOD teams do not normally perform searches in support of bomb-threats.
        3.5.2.2. Use diagnostics and remote procedures first: Hand-entry is a last resort.
        3.5.2.3. Use all available protective gear (e.g., bomb suit).
        3.5.2.4. Refer to the IED CONOP for more details.
     3.5.3. Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). Providing full-spectrum response capability to
     nuclear, biological, chemical, radiological, incendiary, conventional explosive ordnance and
     IEDs. EOD teams respond during the crisis management phase of the incident and provide:
     initial response; situational analysis; advise command authorities on hazards and protective
     measures; and support regional/specialized support teams as required. Refer to the WMD
     CONOP for more details.
AFI32-3001_AFDWSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                                        33


  3.5.4. Nuclear Weapon Incident/Accident. Providing immediate initial support to nuclear
  weapon incidents/accidents. This section outlines service component requirements in DoDD
  3150.2, DoD Nuclear Weapon System Safety Program.
     3.5.4.1. All active duty AF EOD flights maintain qualification to provide emergency
     nuclear support. Flight personnel maintain technical data and are trained to perform those
     actions necessary to stabilize an incident site.
     3.5.4.2. Flights that support assigned nuclear weapons maintain technical data and are
     qualified in all aspects of assigned weapon systems (See paragraph 3.12.5).
  3.5.5. Unexploded Explosive Ordnance (UXO) Recovery Operations. Clearing UXO during
  runway and airbase recovery operations and neutralizing hazards from explosive-related
  incidents, which, because of unusual circumstances, present a threat to operations,
  installations, personnel or material. See UXO-related mission details under paragraphs 3.1
  and 3.2.
  3.5.6. Operational Range Clearance. Working together with range management offices and
  environmental agencies to clear operational ranges and test and evaluation ranges. This
  section outlines service component (EOD) requirements of DoDD 3200.16, Operational
  Range Clearance and DoDD 4140.62, Management and Disposition of Material Potentially
  Presenting an Explosive Hazard (MPPEH). Further implementing guidance is provided in
  AFI 13-212, Range Planning and Operations, Volume 1 and the EOD Range CONOP
  (https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/DocView.asp?DocID=1113486).
     3.5.6.1. Practices for UXO clearance at operational ranges are different from those for
     environmental UXO remediation, and more closely mirror combat EOD duties and
     provides warskills experience for EOD operations. As in combat UXO area clearance,
     peacetime range clearance is usually only a surface clearance. At operational test and
     evaluation ranges, there are requirements for the sub-surface recovery of (sometimes
     deeply buried) experimental ordnance.
     3.5.6.2. Other-than Operational Range Support.
         3.5.6.2.1. EOD flights will not normally perform nor are they responsible for
         activities outside the scope of AFI 13-212 in relation to any range or other munitions
         response site. The AF EOD program is neither equipped, trained, nor manned for
         environmental requirements-based munitions response operations.
         3.5.6.2.2. Non-emergency or planned support on other than operational ranges is
         outside the scope of core competencies for EOD. The below listed duties are
         examples of tasks EOD would not be responsible for:
            3.5.6.2.2.1. Third-party quality assurance evaluations of contracts.
            3.5.6.2.2.2. Natural & cultural environmental escorts.
            3.5.6.2.2.3. Research and provide ordnance information (other than emergency
            response).
            3.5.6.2.2.4. Construction support.
            3.5.6.2.2.5. Sub-surface UXO recovery (e.g., area remediation that is not in
            support of ordnance R&D/OT&E).
34                                     AFI32-3001_AFDWSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009


        3.5.6.2.2.6. Contract oversight.
        3.5.6.2.2.7. Lend-lease-grant final land clearance subsequent to land use by
        commercial ventures.
        3.5.6.2.2.8. Final land-surveys required prior to closure or re-characterization of
        operational ranges.
     3.5.6.2.3. MAJCOM EOD staffs may authorize performance of the above tasks for
     unique individual situations/operations when it provides a warskills benefit.
     Parameters should be established in a supplement to this AFI and in individual
     memorandums between the contract executing agent, flight involved, and MAJCOM
     EOD staff. Courtesy copy HQ AFCESA/CEXD on such memoranda.
        3.5.6.2.3.1. (Added-AFDW) HQ AFDW 7XD is responsible for all EOD actions
        necessary to survey, remediate, and certify excess property under the control of
        this command IAW AFI 32-9004, Disposal of Real Property. The decision to use
        active duty personnel or civilian contractors will be made by HQ AFDW 7XD
        based on current command workload and specific aspects of the property in need
        of certification. HQ AFDW 7XD will:
        3.5.6.2.3.2. (Added-AFDW) Review requests for EOD clearances to ensure
        proper information is provided.
        3.5.6.2.3.3. (Added-AFDW) Formally task AFDW EOD flight or forward initial
        request to appropriate agency.
        3.5.6.2.3.4. (Added-AFDW) Perform periodic on-site program reviews during
        survey and clearance operations, as necessary.
        3.5.6.2.3.5. (Added-AFDW) Send a representative to accompany tasked AFDW
        EOD flight during the site survey.
     3.5.6.2.4. Emergency support to other than operational range activities is part of the
     core competencies for EOD. Upon proper notification, EOD responds to any
     munitions emergency
        3.5.6.2.4.1. To ensure Public Safety.
        3.5.6.2.4.2. To identify unknown munitions.
        3.5.6.2.4.3. When there are possible chemical munitions involved (limited to
        emergency actions prior to arrival of specialized teams).
     3.5.6.2.5. EOD will provide a one-time response to first found munitions or other
     emergency support as outlined in a MAJCOM EOD staff-coordinated memorandum
     of agreement (MOA) or other coordinating document. The MOA will include as a
     minimum a request to provide full support and the required amount of resources
     (equipment, explosives, personnel, time).
        3.5.6.2.5.1. Specific responsibilities provided (EPA permits, security, medical
        etc.).
        3.5.6.2.5.2. Specific responsibilities/duties military is to perform/conduct.
AFI32-3001_AFDWSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                                           35


             3.5.6.2.5.3. Parameters for reimbursement – fee for service – if required.

  paragraph 3.6.2 and the Mortuary Support CONOP for more details.
  3.5.8. Federal Agency and Civil Authority Support. Assisting Federal and civil authorities
  with terrorist or other criminal acts, accidents, found explosive items, and other requests for
  support.
     3.5.8.1. See chapter 7 for detailed guidelines on general support to civil authorities.
     3.5.8.2. Support to the US Secret Service (USSS) and US State Department (DoS) Very
     Important Persons Protection Support Activity (VIPPSA) taskings. This section outlines
     service component requirements in DoDD 3025.13, Employment of DoD Resources in
     Support of the United States Secret Service, and DoD Instruction (DoDI) 5030.34,
     Agreement Between the USSS and the DoD Concerning Protection of the President and
     Other Officials. Detailed procedures of support are provided in the USSS Hazardous
     Device Counter-measures Manual (HDCM).
     3.5.8.2. (AFDW) VIPPSA Taskings (Personnel on standby for AEF deployments may
     not be tasked).
         3.5.8.2.1. Reimbursement for VIPPSA support. Public Law 94-524, Presidential
         Protection Act of 1996, establishes the authority for non-reimbursable DoD support to
         the USSS for protection of the President, Vice-President, or other officer immediately
         next in order of succession to the office of the President. Lack of funding is not a
         reason for non-support of Presidential and Vice- presidential protective mission
         taskings. All other VIPPSA taskings are reimbursable. See paragraph 3.5.8.2.4.
             3.5.8.2.1.1. (Added-AFDW) VIP Missions that are VIPPSA funded will be
             processed through the EOD ACES Program and Defense Travel System (DTS).
             3.5.8.2.1.2. (Added-AFDW) HQ AFDW 7XD forecasts funding to reimburse
             squadron accounts for POTUS and VPOTUS missions. It is after-the-fact
             funding. Units will proceed on their mission using a squadron fund cite.
         3.5.8.2.2. If the personnel are available without impacting the flight‘s ability to
         perform its primary mission, then a VIPPSA tasking must be supported. See
         paragraph 1.9.4.7 to determine availability of personnel.
         3.5.8.2.2.1. Coordinating Support. The U.S. Army is designated as the executive
         office for all VIPPSA taskings from the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD),
         United States Secret Service (USSS), or Department of State (DOS). They task and
         coordinate all missions by DoD EOD personnel, regardless of service affiliation,
         through the U.S. Army EOD Very Important Persons Protection Support Activity
         (USAEODVIPPSA).
         3.5.8.2.3. National Security Events are sourced by NORTHCOM through the AEF
         Center.
         3.5.8.2.4. Approval Authority. Approval authority rests with the MAJCOM EOD
         functional manager. Approval for ANG EOD support, before mobilization, rests with
         the individual state adjutant general.

        3.5.8.2.6.1. Coordinate and facilitate VIP support missions directly with their
        respective EOD flights.
        3.5.8.2.6.2. Promptly send all mission information to the tasked flight.
        3.5.8.2.6.3. Ensure EOD personnel comply with mission requirements.
        3.5.8.2.6.4. (Added-AFDW) USNORTHCOM taskings will come from
        USAEODVIPPSA thru HQ AFDW A4/7XD. We will task EOD flights based on
        team availability. Because of time sensitivity, HQ AFDW 7XD will provide
        tasking information by phone followed by an email tasking message to the flight.
        EOD Team Leader requirement will be in accordance with DoD VIPPSA
        Operations Plan. Tasked team must have at least one 3E851.
     3.5.8.2.7. CONUS MAJCOMs:
        3.5.8.2.7.1. Designate a POC for the USAEODVIPPSA office.

             team availability for after duty hours tasking notification.
             3.5.8.2.7.1.1.3. (Added-AFDW) Flight leaders will investigate credential
             misuse and submit a written report to HQ AFDW 7XD within 30 days of the
             incident. Misuses of pins or credentials are grounds for removal from VIP
             support missions and UCMJ actions.
        3.5.8.2.7.2. Immediately alert USAEODVIPPSA of EOD flights unable to
        provide assigned support due to operational commitments of higher precedence
     3.5.8.2.8. EOD Personnel Requirements:
        3.5.8.2.8.1. Minimum Team Criteria.
           3.5.8.2.8.1.1. Team member: Officer/Enlisted – Six months in-place, assigned

AFI32-3001_AFDWSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                                      37


             information for possible follow-on taskings. Upon notification of VIPPSA
             taskings immediately contact team leader, if team leader cannot be contacted,
             contact the agent-in-charge to check-in and receive specific details on tasking.
          3.5.8.2.9.1. See paragraph 2.2 for security requirements
          3.5.8.2.9.2. EOD personnel receive a civilian clothing allowance while
          supporting USSS or DoD missions. AFI 36-3014, Clothing Allowance for Air
          Force Personnel, specifies authorized amounts, how to apply, and how to get
          reimbursement. Flight chiefs selecting personnel for sup-port missions should first
          consider sending individuals already receiving a civilian clothing allowance.
          Note: Officers must be assigned to overseas EOD billets to receive the clothing
          allowance.
          3.5.8.2.9.3. EOD personnel supporting USAEODVIPPSA Presidential or Vice
          Presidential taskings do not fall under the Presidential Support Program, unless
          such support exceeds 180 continuous days. (See DoDD 5210.55, and AFI 31-501,
          Personnel Security Program Management)
       3.5.8.2.10. EOD Credentials, Pins, Vehicle Placards, and Hazardous Devices
       Counter-Measures (HDCM) Manuals. USAEODVIPPSA issues DD Form 2335,
       EOD Identification Card/Credentials, and identification pins to qualified EOD
       personnel performing VIP support. Vehicle placards and HDCM Manuals are issued
       to EOD flights.
          3.5.8.2.10.1. Credentials. Unless otherwise directed by HQ AFCESA or
          EODVIPPSA, all EOD Credential requests will be initiated within the VIPPSA
          area of ACES EOD Operations Module. Complete requests for EOD Credentials
          IAW the ACES EOD CONOP and ACES EOD Users Manual.
             3.5.8.2.10.1.1. Flights. Ensure all information for all assigned personnel is
             properly entered into the user administration area of ACES EOD.
             3.5.8.2.10.1.2. Flight members will have one digital photo conforming to the
             standards listed below: (a) Digital picture will be squared and have the same

             Card/Credentials, is carried with the individual at all times.
             3.5.8.2.10.1.4. Upon PCS to a new assignment meeting the criteria in
             paragraph 1.8.1, the individual will hand carry the DD Form 2335 to the
             gaining organization.
             3.5.8.2.10.1.5. When an individual retires, separates or when duties do not
             meet the criteria in paragraph 1.8.1, the DD Form 2335 will be mailed back to
             VIPPSA. The flight is not authorized to destroy credentials locally. Note:
             Written official correspondence from USAEODVIPPSA takes precedence

     mine awareness, terrorist bomb search procedures, and personnel protective measures.
        3.5.9.1. Air Force EOR is taught via web-based training. EOD may provide other
        methods to supplement the AF EOR course; however, the web-based training is the
        mandatory basic course.
        3.5.9.2. Flights should use HQ AFCESA-standardized informational training/briefings as
        a template for briefings on EOD mission capability, ordnance hazards and recognition,
        IED awareness, mine awareness, terrorist bomb search procedures, personnel protective
        measures, etc. These briefings are available on the AF EOD Program Management CoP
        at https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/EntryCoP.asp?Filter=OO-EN-CE-49.
AFI32-3001_AFDWSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                                         39


      3.5.9.3. If EOD flights are requested to provide EOD-related briefings to national
      agencies (e.g., Bureau of Land Management (BLM), DTRA, EPA, TSWG, DoD, etc),
      other military services, HQ USAF or Secretary of the AF agencies/offices, the briefings
      require review by MAJCOM EOD staff and HQ AFCESA/CEXD prior to being
      briefed/released.
      3.5.9.4. EOD flights should support community outreach programs to educate both
      installation personnel and the surrounding public on the dangers of trespassing on ranges
      and the hazards associated with UXO.
3.6. Command unique Missions
   3.6.1. Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC). Refer to PACAF mission guidelines
   for details (HQ PACAF/A7XOD, DSN 449-9483).
   3.6.2. Mortuary Affairs and Field Mortuary Response Teams (AMC). Refer to the Mortuary
   Support CONOP for details (https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/DocView.asp?DocID=1113509).
   3.6.3. (Added-AFDW) EOD support to Research, Test, and Development (RT&D)
   Agencies.
      3.6.3.1. (Added-AFDW) EOD Flights are frequently requested to provide support to
      other agencies for various test projects. Normal support consists of providing safe escort
      on ranges and disposal of explosive material upon conclusion of the test. The agency
      requesting EOD support must provide funding, a test/safety plan, and coordinate
      requirements with the supporting EOD Flight. EOD Flights will approve or disapprove
      the support request based on mission impact and personnel availability.
      3.6.3.2. (Added-AFDW) During Research, Test, and Development missions, EOD
      flights may be requested to use equipment, supplies, and demolition material not
      approved by the NNMSB and or do not have approved technical data. Flights must
      develop and submit Operating Instructions and safety/test plans to AFDW A4/7XD at
      least 30 prior to operations for approval. OI‘s must contain information required by
      AFMAN 91-201.
3.7. Incident Command System
   3.7.1. AF Incident Management System (AFIMS).
      3.7.2.1. Homeland Security Presidential Directive-5 directed the implementation the
      National Response Plan (NRP) through the National Incident Management System
      (NIMS). The Air Force chose to develop the Air Force Incident Management System
      (AFIMS) for implementation of the NRP and the NIMS. In the AFIMS structure EOD
      falls under Emergency Support Function (ESF)
      3.7.2.2. The AFIMS replaces the Disaster Control Group and is outlined in AFI 10-2501,
      Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations. All EOD
      managers and team leaders must be familiar with AFIMS.
3.8. Incident Reporting
   3.8.1. Service (ACES-EOD) Incident Reporting.
40                                             AFI32-3001_AFDWSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009


        3.8.1.1. Do not enter Restricted Data (RD) into the ACES-EOD Incident Report system.
        Refer to T.O. and paragraph numbers only.
        3.8.1.2. EOD Flights will use the ACES-EOD Operations Module, Incident Reporting
        System to gather and report information regarding EOD operations to their respective
        MAJCOMs. Flights submit incident reports within 5 working days after response
        termination (15 working days for EOD range clearance reports). The emergency status of
        the ACES-EOD report is category level two (C-2) and requires you to continue normal
        reporting during emergency conditions.
        3.8.1.3. Responding EOD teams will list the individual who positively identified the
        ordnance in the ACES-EOD incident report and the team chief will validate the
        identification. This process is accomplished using the drop down menus provided in the
        ACES-EOD System. If the team chief is the one who identifies the ordnance a different
        EOD technician will verify and be listed on the report (re: paragraph 3.1.1.1).
        3.8.1.4. MAJCOM managers use ACES-EOD Incident Reports to analyze trends,
        identify deficiencies, plan training, and project future activities in all aspects of the EOD
        program. MAJCOMs will review and approve all ACES-EOD Incident Reports within 5
        working days from date received from flights.
        3.8.1.5. Flights should avoid the use of ―thermal treatment‖ and ―disposal‖ (in relation to
        the emergency destruction of UXO and other hazardous explosive devices) in written
        EOD reports because the environmental interpretations of these terms have specific
        meaning and consequences under the RCRA that may impose additional requirements on
        the USAF.
        3.8.1.6. ACES-EOD shares response information (e.g., IED, post-blast, UXO, area
        clearance, etc) with the Joint Digital Information Gathering System (JDIGS) Program:
        this is covered in the ACES-EOD CONOP.
     3.8.2. SORTS Report. SORTS is reported IAW AFI 10-201.
        3.8.2.1. It is the EOD flight management‘s responsibility to ensure manpower,
        equipment and training status is updated in SORTS, normally on a monthly basis in
        coordination with the Readiness Flight, or whenever significant changes occur.
        3.8.2.2. Since the results of individual flight SORTS reports are visible at the Joint
        Service level, input accuracy is critical for high level decision making.
        3.8.2.3. Descriptions should be detailed enough to identify what is missing/causing the
        rating, what needs to be done to fix or mitigate the problem, and a reasonable ECD.
     3.8.3. AEF Reporting Tool (ART).
        3.8.3.1. It is the EOD flight management‘s responsibility to ensure ART accurately
        reflects status of UTCs. Review and make changes monthly or immediately when status
        changes. AEF Center and MAJCOM Functional Managers rely on the accuracy and
        currency of reporting to make critical AEF sourcing decisions.
        3.8.3.1. (AFDW) Units will provide status of each individual assigned to the UTC IAW
        MISCAP Posturing. EXAMPLE UTC 4FPXD LN001 is SSgt or SrA with availability
        status. LN002 TSgt with availability status.
AFI32-3001_AFDWSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                                        41


          3.8.3.1.1. Code Green. Equipment – 100 percent of required equipment and vehicles
          are on hand. Personnel – All personnel are available/proficient with no rank/skill
          level substitutions.
          3.8.3.1.2. Code Yellow. Equipment – some equipment is missing but UTC can still
          accomplish its mission. Personnel – All personnel are available/proficient using
          allowable rank/skill level substitutions. Note: If 3-level substitutions are used the
          comments will indicate that they have completed their CDCs and core 5-level tasks in
          the CFETP.
          3.8.3.1.3. Code Red. Equipment – some or all of equipment is missing and the UTC
          cannot perform its mission. Personnel – Any position is vacant or any personnel lack
          proficiency per paragraph 1.8.2.
       3.8.3.2. All UTCs coded Yellow or Red will have comments explaining why their status
       is downgraded.

Section 3C—EOD Training

3.9. Overview. The Air Force EOD Training Program aims to produce professional, highly
qualified, technically proficient EOD teams capable of safely and efficiently performing
peacetime and wartime EOD missions. EOD proficiency training enables EOD teams to achieve
and maintain a level of competency to safely and effectively deal with explosive hazards.
   3.9.1. Qualification Level. EOD team members must be trained to a knowledge level
   sufficient to determine and observe correct safety requirements needed before and during
   reconnaissance, and obtain the information necessary to positively identify ordnance items
   and formulate an appropriate render safe or disposal plan.
   3.9.2. Need for Practical Training. Hands-on practical training is necessary for required
   proficiency. EOD team members meet acceptable performance standards, with the aid of
   applicable publications, by correctly performing EOD procedures without committing errors
   that degrade safety and risk injury.
3.10. Responsibilities:
   3.10.1. HQ AFCESA/CEXD:
       3.10.1.1. Submits MAJCOM inputs to the EOD Standard Training Package.

                                            Chapter 4

                                        LOGISTICS / A4

4.1. Overview. The ESLs identifies Base Support and EOD mobility equipment required to
support home-station, contingency, and operational plans. HQ AFCESA/CEXD publishes and
distributes to MAJCOMs for implementation. MAJCOMs must use this document when
determining equipment requirements for their flights. The mobility ESLs identifies SORTS
reportable equipment.
4.2. Equipment Supply Listings (ESL). MAJCOMs must adhere to the ESL requirements to
standardize equipment throughout the Air Force EOD program. To ensure standardization of
EOD equipment and supplies, recommended changes to any part of the ESL must have the
concurrence of EOD Equipment Working Group members and be approved by HQ
AFCESACEXD (up to the monetary limits set by the CERB). Major ESL changes (those which
modify the capability of a UTC) should be reviewed by the EODP (out-of-cycle if necessary).
The EODP can request the EWG to readdress an ESL issue. ESLs are available on the AF EOD
Program                       Management                     CoP                         at
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/EntryCoP.asp?Filter=OO-EN-CE-49.
     4.2.1. Accountability. Individuals must maintain and protect all items issued to them. When
     reassigned, issued personal equipment accompanies the individual as professional equipment.
     The losing flight must forward one copy of the individual's AF IMT 538 or a computer-
     generated form to the gaining flight to ensure accountability. The individual must hand carry
     one copy. Note: Active duty and ARC will conduct transfers within their respective Program
     Element Codes.
     4.2.2. ESL Updates. MAJCOMs provide an updated equipment spreadsheet to HQ
     AFCESA/CEXD semiannually (October and May). HQ AFCESA/CEXD consolidates
     MAJCOM inputs for use during the POM Build and Munitions Buy Budget process. All
     items on the ESL with an allowance source code will be placed on the CA-CRL (R-14) per
     AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, chapter 22.
        4.2.2.1. (Added-AFDW) Report any excess EOD equipment to HQ AFDW 7XD for
        possible redistribution.
     4.2.3. Allowance Source Codes (ASC). ASCs are identified on each ESL for equipment
     items.
     4.2.4. Unit Supply Accounts. EOD Flights must maintain an equipment, munitions, supply,
     and weapons accounts in accordance with Air Force guidance and local directives.
     4.2.5. (Added-AFDW) Flights will budget for a minimum of 10% of funded positions for
     personal retention gear annually. The flight must develop a prioritized personal equipment
     requirement listing for new personnel arriving from EOD School.

                   STRATEGIC PLANS AND REQUIREMENTS / A5

5.1. Air Force Deliberate Planning.
   5.1.1. USAF War Mobilization Plan (WMP). The WMP is discussed in AFMAN 10-401,
   Operational Plan and Concept Plan Development and Implementation. The WMP is the
   principle AF document that feeds the joint-service planning system – specifically, the Joint
   Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP). The WMP is a five-volume Air Force document that
   provides Air Staff and USAF commanders with current policies, forces, and planning factors
   for conducting and supporting wartime operations. Volume 1 (WMP-1) is important for
   flights: WMP-1, Annex S, Appendix 9 outlines EOD wartime posturing, capability, and
   deliberate planning for worst-case scenarios. Flight managers should be familiar with EOD
   capabilities and the deliberate planning factors. Flights comply with paragraph 1.2.7 of this
   instruction to ensure correct UTC data is available for loading in the TPFDD libraries.
      5.1.1.1. WMP-3, Part 2, is the list of combat and support forces, by UTC and location,
      available to the war-planners and combatant commanders. Flights comply with paragraph
      1.2.8 of this instruction to ensure correctness of WMP-3, Part 2.
   5.1.2. DOC-Taskings. DOC-Taskings outline which OPlan flights are attached to, and the
   UTCs they are required to posture (as well as SORTS and ART reporting requirements).
5.2. Wing/Installation Contingency and Support Plans.
   5.2.1. Review Plans. Review Wing/Installation Contingency and Support Plans annually.
   These plans are normally available through Wing Plans (XP or A5) office.
   5.2.2. Garrison Expeditionary Support Plans (GESP). Every base has this plan. Ensure EOD
   requirements are listed in this plan. It explains the Ready Augmentee Program requirements,
   vehicle needs, and other parameters of support.
   5.2.3. Emergency Management (EM) Planning. EM planning is covered in AFI 10-2501, Air
   Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations. EOD flights use
   EM planning in addition to the EOD mission CONOPs to assist in developing team chief
   guides for emergency response.
5.3. Plan Sourcing Procedures.
   5.3.1. UTC Availability. EOD flight chief in conjunction with the Unit Deployment
   Manager (UDM) will update ART and SORTS in accordance with local procedures and AFI
   10-210.
   5.3.2. Deployed TOs. Deployed teams must coordinate with theater EOD functional with the
   number of TO sets dispatched so TO distribution can be identified at the deployed base.

                                 SIGNAL AND COMMUNICATIONS / A6

6.1. Home station LMR requirements. In addition to a dedicated EOD net, EOD Flights will
have access to a minimum of the following radio nets: airfield control tower, fire/crash, CE,
Security Forces, and supported ranges (as required).
6.2. Tactical communications. These requirements are listed in the EOD ESL.
6.3. COMSEC. EOD flights must have COMSEC accounts for management of secure
communications and navigational AIDS.
6.4. Satellite Communications. Prior to acquisition, coordinate satellite communications
terminal purchases with MAJCOM EOD functional management, HQ AFCESA/CEXD, and the
local communications squadron to ensure equipment interoperability, frequency approval,
downlink support and satellite service access/availability.
6.5. Frequency Management. Flights and MAJCOMs must obtain radio frequency assignment
for EOD electronic tools (e.g., Counter Radio-controlled IED Electronic Warfare (CREW)
devices, robots, remote firing devices, x-ray devices, etc) from base level spectrum manager or
the Air Force Frequency Management Agency (AFFMA) (DoDD 4650.1, Policy for
Management and Use of the Electromagnetic Spectrum, and AFMAN 33-120, Electromagnetic
Spectrum Management).
     6.5.1. Even if EOD electronic tools have prior joint-service or Air Force spectrum
     certification, flights must coordinate local equipment spectrum certification prior to
     equipment being placed in operation using DD Form 1494, Application for Equipment
     Frequency Allocation. 5 Be sure to plan for foreign frequency authorizations for potential
     forward deployed locations.
     6.5.2. Use of electronic attack equipment (e.g. CREW) requires frequency assignment for
     training, testing, and exercises. Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Manual (CJCSM) 3212.02B,
     Performing Electronic Attack in the United States and Canada for Tests, Training, and
     Exercises, is the official guidance for frequency clearance procedures for performing
     electronic attack.

Section 7B—Federal and Civil Support

7.2. Installation Support to Off-Base EOD Response. As outlined in DoDD 2000.13, Civil
Affairs, this section provides EOD guidance to meet the life sustaining needs of the civilian
population and provide expertise to restore civilian sector functions.
     7.2.1. Support Staff. The installation commander or designee, a Public Affairs
     representative, and a JA representative should accompany the EOD team to the location of
     the incident. However, emergency responses to potentially life-threatening emergencies will
     not be delayed awaiting legal reviews or unified media responses.
        7.2.1.1. The commander may designate the senior EOD team member as his
        representative pending determination of the need for additional support.
        7.2.1.2. The PA and JA representatives may be in ―on-call‖ status pending determination
        of the need for additional support.
     7.2.2. Risk Category. An incident risk category is assigned per AFJI-32-3002, Interservice
     Responsibilities for EOD. Commanders must limit exposure of EOD personnel to risk of
     injury or loss of life unless the critical nature of the threat to the civilian population clearly
     justifies the risk. Base the risk decision on a joint assessment of the incident by the senior
     EOD representative and the on-scene commander.
     7.2.3. Response Parameters. See details for responding to military ordnance and to non-
     military devices/explosives in paragraph 3.1.4.
7.3. EOD Assistance to Civil authorities.
     7.3.1. Directive Authority. This section provides guidance for emergency EOD response to
     hazardous explosives, or explosive devices, that threaten the civil populace, authorizing
     installation commanders, on request from civil authorities, to provide EOD assistance per the
     following conditions:
        7.3.1.1. All off-installation EOD emergency responses in support of civil authorities are
        initially treated as ―immediate response‖ requests under DoD Directives 3025.1, Military
        Support to Civil Authorities (MSCA) and 3025.15, Military Assistance to Civil Authorities
        until an on-site EOD assessment of the situation determines otherwise.
        7.3.1.2. As soon as practical, the particulars of the support to civil authorities (see
        paragraph 3.1.4) will be provided, through command post channels, to the National
        Military Command Center (NMCC).
        7.3.1.3. All MSCA response activities will be conducted in accordance with AFPD 10-8,
        Homeland Defense and Civil Support, and AFI 10-802, Military Support to Civil
        Authorities.
AFI32-3001_AFDWSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                                            65


  7.3.2. Reimbursement of civil EOD support. Flights will coordinate with their installation
  legal office and financial management/comptroller to build a list of expenses that are eligible
  for reimbursement and clarify when reimbursement for EOD support should be billed to civil
  authorities (e.g., loss of military specialized equipment, travel/per-diem costs, and/or military
  man-hours). Reimbursement applies only for response actions to non-military munitions.
  Emergency EOD support will not be withheld due to lack of reimbursement. Flights will
  also:
     7.3.2.1. Maintain logs of expenses incurred and resources expended when providing
     support to civil authorities.
     7.3.2.2. Report all MSCA support to their local Command Post and Comptroller.
     7.3.2.3. Work with their local Comptroller to develop procedures to seek reimbursement
     for EOD support provided to local and federal civil authorities.

                                           Chapter 8

                    PROGRAMS AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT / A8

8.1. Civil Engineer Financial Planning and Budgeting.
     8.1.1. Program Planning – Facility Operations Model (FOM). AFI 32-10140, Programming
     and Budgeting Appropriated Funded Facilities Operation Requirements, implements the
     programming and budgeting appropriated funded facilities operation requirements.
        8.1.2.1. The FOM outlines and formats Active Duty operational budgetary requirements.
        It identifies major program entities for each EOD flight‘s funding (i.e., personnel
        authorized, equipment UTCs, flights, mission parameters, etc) for forecasting purposes.
        8.1.2.2. EOD flights provide changes to the FOM per local requirements with info copy
        to their MAJCOM functional manager:
            8.1.2.1.1. MAJCOMs will consolidate flight data and report all changes to
            established programs (such as changes in DOC-tasked UTCs, authorized manning, or
            mission changes) to AFCESA annually after budget submission.
            8.1.2.1.2. Identify recurring unique requirements not covered in standard AF EOD
            missions for addition in the FOM.
        8.1.2.2. HQ AFCESA/CEXD will maintain the FOM model and be the Air Force focal
        point for inputting all EOD flight requirements.
     8.1.3. Budget Forecasting. Flights will use available financial management tools to forecast
     budgets. Flights should use a three-year historical basis to average and track expenditures.
     Note: Factor USSS support based on either election or non-election year averages, as
     applicable.
8.2. Cost Center Management (Budgets). Flight managers must prepare flight budgets, ensure
requirements are incorporated into the parent flight budget, monitor funds expenditure through
the year, and request additional funds when needed. Close coordination with squadron Resources
Managers and owning MAJCOM EOD staff is critical in an effective Planning, Programming,
Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process.
AFI32-3001_AFDWSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                                      67


                                         Chapter 9

            ASSESSMENTS, LESSONS LEARNED, AND EXERCISES / A9

9.1. Lessons Learned (LLs) Tracking. All levels of command may report lessons learned.
After Action Reports are normally completed at deployed location or within 30 days after
completion of an operation.
   9.1.1. Submitting LLs. A person or flight having LLs provides the issues in writing to the
   contingency theater headquarters staff and to the parent MAJCOM EOD Staff for review and
   consolidation, ensuring there is no redundancy in the Joint Universal Lessons Learned
   System (JULLS). . MAJCOMs forward LLs to HQ AFCESA for presentation to the EOD
   Panel (EODP), or out-of-cycle EODP review if necessary.
   9.1.2. EODP Actions. The EODP will discuss and determine if the LLs warrant the
   expenditure of resources. If the EODP accepts/approves the LLs, they are linked to EODP
   Action Items for tracking and resolution.
   9.1.3. HQ AFCESA Actions. CEXD uses a Lessons Learned (LL) database to track LL until
   the ACES EOD LL Module becomes available. Manage the ACES EOD LL IAW the ACES
   EOD CONOP and ACES Users Manual.
9.2. EODP Action Item Process.
   9.2.1. Submitting Action Items.
      9.2.1.1. Any EOD technician, flight, or agency having a proposal to bring before EODP
      must have MAJCOM EOD staff review and sponsorship for the proposal.
      9.2.1.2. The EODP is the first level for AF-level issues and recommendations affecting
      the AF EOD career field. A proposal brought before the EODP must be done in
      compliance with the EODP charter.
   9.2.2. Processing Action Items.
      9.2.2.1. The EODP will discuss and determine if the proposal warrants the expenditure
      of resources. The EODP takes appropriate action after the proposal is voted on (e.g.,
      create an action item).
      9.2.2.2. Each EODP action item is assigned an OPR, and actions toward completion are
      tracked in a HQ AFCESA/CEXD database. The data base is updated and managed
      throughout the year and scrubbed semi-annually during EODP meetings. Action Items
      are incorporated into the AF EOD Business Plan when appropriate.
      9.2.2.3. Action items involving CE policy or funding issues may require review and
      approval by the Civil Engineer Readiness Board (CERB) or the Civil Engineer Readiness
      Council (CERC).
9.3. Exercise Support and Planning.
   9.3.1. Home-Station Support. EOD flights should provide an additional duty member to the
   installation exercise evaluation team.
68                                           AFI32-3001_AFDWSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009


     9.3.2. EOD Support to Deployed Exercises. Unless on-site USAF EOD support is available
     at the exercise locations, MAJCOMs must provide EOD teams to support all aircraft
     deployment exercises when munitions are used. On-site USAF EOD support is necessary to
     provide safe and timely support for aircraft and munitions operations. Note: EOD from other
     US service components may be employed after a commander‘s multi-functional ORM
     assessment and approval. In such cases, commanders should obtain, in advance, a
     documented memorandum of agreement for dedicated support to the Air Force exercise.
9.4. Quality Assurance (QA). All EOD flights will have some form of QA program. For
example, smaller EOD flights may choose to adopt the parent squadron/wing program but flights
(especially those larger than 20 authorized personnel) are encouraged to have an in-flight
program with a dedicated QA person/section.
     9.4.1. (Added-AFDW) EOD flight will have an in-house Quality Assurance program.

 MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (MOU)BETWEEN{INSERT BASE NAME}
 AIR FORCE BASE AND{INSERT STATE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL
                         QUALITY TITLE}


Parties: The parties to this MOU are {INSERT BASE NAME} Air Force Base a Department of
Defense (DoD) military organization located at {INSERT BASE NAME}, {INSERT STATE}
and the{INSERT STATE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY TITLE}.
Background:
    DoD Component military organizations have personnel specially trained to handle all types
    of explosives, including improvised explosive devices. Other Federal agencies request
    assistance from DoD Component Commander in emergencies involving explosives. These
    situations call for immediate action to abate the safety threat by treatment in place or removal
    to a safe location for treatment.
    U.S. EPA‘s Military Munitions Rule (MR) (62 FR 6622, Feb. 12, 1997) makes it clear that
    EOD personnel engaged in an explosives or munitions emergency response are exempt from
    the generator, transporter, treatment, storage, and disposal unit requirements of the Solid
    Waste Disposal Act (42 USC Sec 6901, et seq.). The standards the MR established govern
    this MOU, whether the Federal or state government is administering the MR or the Solid
    Waste Act, in whole or part.
    Except for providing temporary storage or treatment of explosives to provide emergency life
    saving assistance to civilian authorities or to assist law enforcement agencies per established
    agreements between DOD and the Federal agency concerned, the DOD is prohibited by law
    (10 USC 2692) from using DOD installations for the storage or treatment of non-DOD
    owned hazardous materials.
Purpose: This MOU, which addresses the roles and responsibilities of all parties regarding
notification responsibilities during emergency response operations, is intended to:
    Minimize the risk to public safety from the DoD Component EOD operations.
    Maximize the efficiency, safety, and speed of any explosives treatment or retrieval operation.
    Establish a framework for mutual assistance and consultation among the parties with respect
    to Component EOD explosives or munitions emergency response operations
Scope: This MOU applies to DoD Component EOD explosives or munitions response
operations.

Definitions:
   Explosives or Munitions Emergency. A situation, which involves the suspected or detected
   presence of unexploded ordnance (UXO), damaged or deteriorated explosives or munitions,
   improvised explosive device (IED) post rendered-safe hazardous components, other
   potentially explosive material or devices, or other potentially harmful military munitions or
   devices, that creates an actual or potential imminent threat to human health, to include public
   safety, or the environment, to include property, as determined by an EOD specialist. The
   EOD specialist may determine that such situations require immediate and expeditious action
   to control, mitigate, or eliminate the threat.
   Explosives or Munitions Emergency Response. All immediate response activities by an EOD
   response specialist to control, mitigate, or eliminate the actual or potential threat encountered
AFI32-3001_AFDWSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                                           81


  during an explosive or munitions emergency. An explosives or munitions emergency
  response may include in-place render safe procedures, treatment or destruction of the
  explosives or munitions or the transport of the items to another location to be rendered safe,
  treated, or destroyed. Any reasonable delay in the completion of an explosives or munitions
  emergency response caused by a necessary, unforeseen, or uncontrollable circumstance does
  not terminate the explosives or munitions emergency response. Explosives or munitions
  emergency response can occur on either private or public lands and are not limited to
  responses to RCRA facilities. There are two types of explosives or munitions emergency
  responses:
      Level 1 Response. Immediate response to situations where explosives or munitions are
      not properly secured or under military control if military munitions and thus threaten or
      potentially threaten human health and safety, the environment, or property. When
      extenuating circumstances exist, e.g., adverse weather, nightfall, or safety considerations,
      delay actions necessary to terminate an explosives or munitions emergency, the response
      will be delayed until the necessary action(s) can be accomplished. EOD or Technical
      Escort Unit (TEU) personnel must ensure explosives or munitions are in a safe and secure
      environment.
      Level 2 Response. Response actions to situations involving explosives or munitions
      which pose an imminent and substantial danger to human health and safety, the
      environment, or property, but for which response actions may be temporarily delayed
      without compromising safety or increasing risk. When EOD or TEU support is not
      required during a Level 2 response, qualified personnel, such as weapons officers,
      ammunition handlers, and trained and certified DoD contractors may conduct Level 2
      responses, or as directed. In such cases, time may allow for an emergency permit to be
      obtained. The parties acknowledge that explosives or munitions emergencies present
      unique facts and circumstances and must therefore be evaluated case-by-case. In the
      absence of full and complete information, which frequently occurs when notice of an
      explosive or munitions emergency is received and first responded to, emergency response
      specialists, based on their knowledge, training, and experience, must use their best
      judgment in assessing risk. It is therefore to be expected that as the response to an

      explosive or munitions emergency progresses, a Level 1 response may become a Level 2
      response and vice versa.
  Explosive or Munitions Emergency Response Specialist. Personnel trained in the
  identification, handling, treatment, transport, and destruction of explosives or chemical and
  conventional munitions. Explosives or munitions emergency response specialists include
  DoD EOD personnel who are trained to responds to emergency situations involving military
  munitions and explosives; DoD Technical Escort Unit (TEU) personnel who are trained to
  respond to chemical munitions emergencies; and DOE, National Guard, and Coast Guard
  specialists who are trained to respond to chemical munitions emergencies. EOD and TEU
  personnel respond to on-installation and off-installation incidents involving military
  munitions. They also respond to request by other Federal agencies or local civil authorities
  for assistance with incidents involving non-military explosives with component commander
  approval. DoD certified civilian or contractor personnel; and other Federal, State, or local
  government, or civilian personnel similarly trained in explosives or munitions emergency
  responses are also included.

   Military Munitions. Per Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 260.10, Hazardous
   Waste Management System, General, Sub Part B, Definitions; all ammunition products and
   components produced or used by or for DoD or the U.S. Armed Services for national defense
   and security, including military munitions under the control of the Department of Defense,
   the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Department of Energy, and National Guard personnel. The
   term military munitions:
       Includes: Confined gaseous, liquid, and solid propellants, explosives, pyrotechnics,
       chemical and riot control agents, smokes, and incendiaries used by DoD Components,
       including bulk explosives and chemical warfare agents, chemical munitions, rockets,
       guided and ballistic missiles, bombs, warheads, mortar rounds, artillery ammunition,
       small arms ammunition, grenades, mines, torpedoes, depth charges, cluster munitions and
       dispensers, demolition charges, and devices and any components of such.
       Does not include: wholly inert items, improvised explosive devices, and nuclear
       weapons, devices, and components of such.
       However, it does include non-nuclear components of nuclear devices, managed under
       DOE‘s nuclear weapons program after all required sanitization operations under the
       Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, have been completed.
   A DoD military emergency response in the public sector is a response to an event that occurs
   outside of a military installation.

        explosives requires a permit.
        Ensure site and residual contamination remediation at the emergency response site, if the
        object of the emergency response is a non-military explosive or munitions. (Note: The
        DoD EOD or TEU organization responding to an explosives or munitions emergency or
        providing a donor explosive used to destroy the object is not, under any condition or
        circumstances, responsible for remediation actions. If the objective of the emergency
        response is a military munition, then DoD, the military service, or other Federal agency
        (e.g., DOE) retains responsibility for any remediation of residual contamination.)
        Requesting incident information from the installation commander regarding responding
        EOD organization, as necessary to complete the required reports.
