5. Exercise Evaluation Program:
     5.1. General Information
        5.1.1. Each EET member is appointed by their respective commander and assigned to the
        EET as an additional duty. This appointment memorandum is maintained by the 507
        EET chief, (507 ARW/CCO) and Emergency Management, (507 MSG/CEX).
        5.1.2. EET members are trained using the Advanced Distributed Learning Services
        (ADLS) Exercise Evaluation Course, Major Command (MAJCOM) specific criteria, and
        installation-specific criteria. Topics include an overview of the Air Force EM program,
        team member roles and responsibilities, the Air Force Incident Management System,
        exercise planning, coordination, ground rules, scripting, conduct, evaluation, reports, and
        analysis.
        5.1.3. The EET chief, with the assistance of 507 MSG/CEX and EET members, will plan
        and conduct exercises to evaluate the capabilities of the 507 ARW in supporting all local
        and higher headquarters tasking.
     5.2. Concept of Operations.
        5.2.1. EET members are critical to the success of the exercise and evaluation program.
        Selected by unit commanders from their most qualified personnel and acting as exercise
        "Trusted Agents", they directly assist the EET chief by identifying, planning, and
        arranging discrete exercise events within their respective area of expertise. The EET
        members, utilizing their knowledge of command emphasis areas and guidelines, aid the
        EET chief in setting overall exercise objectives. In the exercise planning stage, they
        interact with the EET chief to build the exercise and establish a workable exercise
        timetable, or schedule of events.
        5.2.2. During the exercise, the EET members execute scheduled events at the direction of
        the EET chief and evaluate the resultant response. They also coordinate with other EET
        members during exercise execution to ensure exercise events do not impede the overall
        exercise schedule. Necessary exercise adjustments are made in coordination with the
        EET chief. The EET may also instruct and make on-the-spot corrections as necessary to
        enhance the exercise's training value. Their evaluations and observations become the
        basis for the exercise critique and ultimately the exercise evaluation report.
        5.2.3. After the exercise, the EET must be able to provide participants with a true overall
        rating of their performance. The EET must be prepared to justify and support all
        deficiencies discovered during the evaluation. Based upon the EET evaluation of a
        particular plan, regulation, or procedure, changes may be recommended to the OPR to
        improve upon their product.

          additional items added.
    5.4. Ground Rules.
       5.4.1. Avoid stereotyping exercises. Vary exercise locations to increase realism and
       participation. Thoroughly plan and design scenarios to create the stress and pressure that
       occurs in a real disaster or attack situation.
          5.4.1.1. Give required operational reports (voice and message) to the evaluators in
          writing. Do not transmit these reports off base unless instructed to do so.
          5.4.1.2. Do not recall people from leave or temporary duty.              Complete all
          administrative forms and give them to the evaluators.
          5.4.1.3. When responding to an exercise, use warning lights but not sirens on
          emergency vehicles. Use vehicle-mounted sirens or horns to announce withdrawal
          from the accident site. 5.4.1.4. Follow procedures in Air Force Joint Instruction
          (AFJI) 11-204, Operational Procedures for Aircraft Carrying Hazardous Materials,
          when simulating radio calls from aircraft carrying dangerous material.
          5.4.1.4. Use TO 11N-20-11, General Fire Fighting Procedures, line numbers in
          telephone, radio, and written communication during nuclear weapon accident
          exercises.
          5.4.1.5. Conduct exercises in security areas. However, do not plan disaster exercises
          to simulate a hostile or covert penetration of security areas.
          5.4.1.6. Do not block alert force routes or runways and do not locate simulated
          accidents closer than 1,000 feet (330 meters) to weapon-loaded aircraft.
          5.4.1.7. Consider safety in all aspects of the exercise.
          5.4.1.8. Restrict entry into facilities exempted from total evacuation to essential
          personnel and people having legitimate business within the facility. Personnel who
          were conducting business when evacuation was directed will continue their business,
          but must remain in the facility until the evacuation portion of the exercise is over.
          Check evacuation plans for exempted facilities and question assigned personnel to
          make sure they know how to evacuate. Do not evacuate facilities which, if shut down
          and restarted, would cause damage or generate considerable expense. One person
          may be left in each evacuated facility for security/fire protection purposes. During
507ARWI10-2501 3 AUGUST 2010                                                                   9


        exercises involving simulated toxic materials or explosive hazards, place primary
        emphasis on evacuation and protection of personnel and equipment. Do not evacuate
        the facilities below without coordination:
           5.4.1.8.1. Command posts, control centers, base operations dispatch desks, air
           traffic control facilities, central security control, telephone switchboards,
           communications centers, and fire and weather stations.
           5.4.1.8.2. Alert aircraft, alert facilities, liquid oxygen and nitrogen plants,
           Petroleum, Oils and Lubricants (POL), hydrant facilities, computer rooms, and
           waste disposal facilities.
           5.4.1.8.3. Hospital, clinic, and dental facilities.
           5.4.1.8.4. Academic testing facilities when testing is in progress.
           5.4.1.8.5. Security and law enforcement entry control points and posts.
           5.4.1.8.6. Schools, nurseries, Base Exchange facilities, commissaries, credit
           unions, banks, post offices, religious services, dining facilities, and military court
           facilities.
           5.4.1.8.7. Munitions storage areas and navigational aid facilities.
        5.4.1.9. Wear all individual protective training equipment, including protective
        masks, during exercises. Exercise participants will not wear protective masks while
        driving a privately owned vehicle. Protective masks will not be worn while driving a
        Government Owned Vehicle (GOV) off-base.
        5.4.1.10. Do not use major accident events conducted and evaluated as part of an
        attack response exercise to meet major accident response exercise requirements.
        5.4.1.11. Include the phrase "This is an exercise message." at the beginning and very
        end of all written and verbal exercise communications.
        5.4.1.12. When using the installation warning system, tell the base populace, the
        surrounding civilian population, and local civil authorities well in advance of the
        exercise.
        5.4.1.13. General and special purpose vehicles and aerospace ground equipment
        located inside the cordon must be moved outside the cordon.
        5.4.1.14. Decrease the cordon size, if necessary, to keep accident response forces
        within the area owned or controlled by the AFRC unit.
        5.4.1.15. If utility shutdown is simulated, personnel must respond to the appropriate
        shutdown location and demonstrate knowledge of proper facility shutdown
        procedures.
     5.4.2. Ground Rules for Movement of Aircraft. All aircraft movement is simulated.
     Ground rules for simulating aircraft movement will be taken from HQ AMC/IG ground
     rules.

6. Exercise Preparation and Planning.
   6.1. Exercises require thorough planning and preparation if all exercise objectives are to be
   satisfied. Many exercise objectives are published within the basic regulation or directive
   requiring the exercise. Other objectives may be determined locally by the unit commander
   and/or based upon findings from previous exercises.
   6.2. Exercise Sequence Planning.
      6.2.1. The EET chief determines and coordinates exercise planning requirements/date(s)
      based on the complexity of the exercise. Exercise planning will incorporate all of the
      following with either more or fewer meetings as required.
      6.2.2. Meeting #1 is an initial planning effort to identify exercise objectives and
      concepts, schedule times and dates for EET meeting, and establish OPRs for each
      scenario. Also, discuss the probable scenario.
      6.2.3. Meeting #2, EET members meet to develop scenarios and establish props required
      and assign OPRs to obtain. EET members provide inputs (event cards) to the EET chief
      and exercise timing is established based on the scenario(s).
      6.2.4. Meeting #3, EET chief publishes a draft of Master Scenario of Event Listing
      (MSEL) and briefs to EET members. Also, adjust exercise schedule if needed and
      discuss previous findings. The EET reviews the sequence to ensure all objectives are
      covered and that the exercise challenges all participants.
      6.2.5. Meeting #4, EET chief gives pre-exercise brief, discuss limiting factors and gives
      out radios and call signs. Input cards are published and distributed to appropriate EET
      member. Establish date for hotwash, and suspense evaluators for inputs.
   6.3. Exercise Execution.
      6.3.1. EET members should be in place at their evaluation posts as directed by the EET
      chief. For exercises requiring Fire Department and/or Tower involvement, these
      evaluators must be in place 30 minutes before exercise starts to formally notify the Fire
      and Tower chiefs. This is required to ensure that agencies can identify response forces
      and retain an actual force for real time emergencies.
      6.3.2. Any deviations to the published timing sequence must be approved by the EET
      chief. Requests for simulations or exercise exemptions must be approved by the EET
      chief.
      6.3.3. Safety will not be compromised during any exercise and each EET member must
      be constantly attuned to potential unsafe actions by exercise players. The exercises may
      be placed on hold for unsafe actions observed by any EET member. In this case, the EET
      chief must be notified immediately.
      6.3.4. Actual emergencies occurring during the exercise may be cause to terminate or
      place the exercise on hold status. This determination will be finalized by the EET chief
      and responding units (normally the host EMT).
507ARWI10-2501 3 AUGUST 2010                                                                       11


        6.3.5. Minor errors discovered and corrected by players may be mentioned in the report
        as a REPEAT but will not be used as a finding. Remember, exercises are training
        situations during which the players can fine tune their actions; do not fault players for
        actively playing the game and making minor errors that could be corrected on the spot.
   6.4. After-Exercise Actions.
        6.4.1. The EET chief will schedule a hotwash to follow the exercise.
        6.4.2. EET members will meet for the exercise hotwash. All events will be covered and
        any findings, observations, and recommendations will be validated.
        6.4.3. Player validation will include all exercise main events with findings, observations,
        and recommendations of the appropriate event. Players have the option to request full
        justification on findings that they feel are questionable.
        6.4.4. Grading Criteria. Exercises are no-fault or training oriented.             The wing
        commander has the option to require ratings.
        6.4.5. Reports and Analysis. Exercise reports may be in any format but must identify the
        type of exercise, summarize the scenario, identify findings, assign offices of primary and
        collateral responsibility, assign a suspense for replies, and list ratings (if used). Suspense
        times for critiques, reports, and replies are determined locally. The EET chief analyzes
        individual and collective exercise reports to identify recurring or common deficiencies
        and reports to the readiness working group. Identify recurring deficiencies in the exercise
        report and use them as objectives in future exercises. Observations/Discrepancies will be
        tracked by the EET chief as part of the unit self-assessment program.
