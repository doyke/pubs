     boards.
        6.1.1. Wing Staff Organizations may submit one nominee per category to 354
        CPTS/CCF for competition at a squadron-level equivalent board separate from the 354
        CPTS. The winner at this level is called the Wing Staff winner. The CPTS/CCF will
        include the Wing Staff winner in the Wing Staff Agency boards. Winners at the WSA
        level will compete at the FW board.
     6.2. Flt/CC and the civilian categories will be selected by package review only using the AF
     Form 1206 IMT (current version). Enlisted and FGO/CGO award nominees will be selected
     by package review and a personal interview (via Video Teleconference (VTC) or telephone
     accompanied by picture in service dress). If a nominee is unable to meet the board in person,
     VTC, or telephone, the absent nominee will receive the mean score of the nominees that met
     the board. The face-to-face board may be canceled if board members are not able to attend,
     more than 50 percent of nominees are unable to attend, or military requirements dictate as
     determined by the 354 FW/CCC. The board will primarily score on military bearing, dress
     and appearance, general Air Force knowledge and communication skills.
        6.2.1. Enlisted Category Questions. Each nominee should be able to effectively
        communicate questions from the following chapters of the Professional Development
        Guide (PDG) during the board process:

Table 1. Enlisted Category Questions
Chapter 2—AIRMAN HERITAGE

Chapter 5—EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

Chapter 8—MILITARY CUSTOMS, COURTESIES, AND PROTOCOL FOR SPECIAL EVENTS

Chapter 11—THE ENLISTED EVALUATION SYSTEM (EES) (NCO & SNCO ONLY)

Chapter 15—PERSONNEL PROGRAMS (NCO & SNCO ONLY)

Chapter 17—DRESS AND APPEARANCE

Chapter 18—FIT FORCE

Current Events—Newspapers, magazines and other media sources as they are related to the military.
        6.2.2. FGO/CGO Category Questions. Each board member will submit two or more
        generally opinion-based questions which will be reviewed and approved by the President
        of the board in advance. Below are some basic principles or topics that can be used to
        develop questions to use on the board.
             6.2.2.1. Mission. The primary task of a military organization is to perform its
             mission. This is paramount, and everything else must be subordinate to this objective.
             As a leader, your primary responsibility is to lead people to carry out the unit’s
             mission successfully.
354FWI36-2802 17 OCTOBER 2013                                                                   5


          6.2.2.2. Leadership. Effective Leadership is essential to a successful officer.
          Increased proficiency in preparation of performance reports and knowing the proper
          way to wear the uniform are skills that will help improve officership. But such
          proficiency is not essential to an officer. Leadership is essential.
          6.2.2.3. Leading by Example. You must set the standard for your unit. People will
          emulate your standards of personal conduct and appearance. They will observe your
          negative characteristics as well as your positive ones. If you are arrogant, or lead by
          intimidation, you will not earn true respect, only resentment.
          6.2.2.4. Core Values. Integrity First, Service Before Self, Excellence in All We Do
          6.2.2.5. Current Events. Staying abreast of current events helps complete the
          "Whole Person" concept.
6.3. Administrative Procedures for Submission of Nominations

   based on the score sheet (Attachment 2). NOTE: The points shown on the score sheet are for
   a frame of reference. Scoring the packages and interview are at the discretion of the board

   Order scores after any further discussion is that board’s recommended winner. Results are
   not final until the 354 FW/CC approves the recommendations from each board. Once

   with the First Sergeants' Council/Annual Awards Committee.
   9.2. Board members will rank order nominees (i.e. 1, 2, 3, etc) regardless of the member’s

   appropriated employees are eligible to compete in the categories identified in Table 11.1

   the kinds of knowledge and skills required, degree of difficulty involved, kind of supervision
   received, nature of personal judgment required, level and purpose of contacts, and impact of
   work environment or inherent risks and hazards involved in the work. Because of this, pay
   grades do not correlate directly to an award category. The award categories are based on type
   of service provided to the base.

     11.11.1. The 354 FW/CV has overall responsibility for the civilian board and is the
     board president. One board will meet for all civilian categories. The board will be
     comprised of three civilian employees. The CV will act as a tie breaker if necessary.
     11.11.2. Each selection board member will evaluate each nominee using the Civilian
     Board Score sheet. Once the board is concluded, the board president will tabulate and
     produce a merit order listing showing the relative ranking of each nominee within their
     respective categories. The board president will then pass the listing to the 354 FW/CCCA
     for presentation coordination.
     11.11.3. Monetary awards should be granted when merited regardless of the employee's
     grade, level of responsibility, or type of responsibility. It is important that awards be
     granted for job-related contributions only if the contribution is clearly beyond

     scoring nominees.
        11.11.3.1. Is the subject of the contribution clearly above and beyond the scope of
        the employee's performance requirements?

        11.11.3.4. Will there be substantial impact or benefits derived from the contribution?
     11.11.4. Board members will score nominee packages as follows using the Civilian
     Board Member Score sheet:
        11.11.4.1. Each OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE IN PRIMARY DUTIES and
        OTHER ACHIEVEMENT bullets can only be awarded points from one of the point
        categories. Award of 1/2 points is authorized. If used, sub-bullets will be considered
        as individual bullets for awarding points. Each line of a multi-line bullet may be
        considered as separate bullets for awarding points.
        11.11.4.2. The point categories are duty performance, self-improvement, community
        service, and no points.
        11.11.4.3. Duty Performance Points. Board members may assign up to two points to
        each bullet that reflects superior performance in the performance of duties.
14                                                     354FWI36-2802 17 OCTOBER 2013


        Performance may be in primary duties, additional duties, or other achievements that
        cannot be classified in the self improvement or community service point categories.
        11.11.4.4. Other Achievements Points. Board members may assign up to two points
        to each bullet that reflects significant self-improvement or community service. Self-
        improvement may be education, training, or professional association membership.
        Community service reflects military or civilian community support, which may be
        service club membership, community activism, or base service. Community service
        must project a positive image of employees of the United States government.
        11.11.4.5. No Points. Board members may assign zero points to each bullet that
        cannot be classified in the three point awarding categories.
  11.12. Winner Selection.
     11.12.1. After scoring packages, board members will tally the scores for each nominee.
     The nominee with the most points will be Merit Ranked number 1; the second most
     points will be Merit Ranked number 2, and so on until all nominees have received a Merit
     Rank Order within their respective category. Completed score sheets will be submitted to
     the board president.
     11.12.2. The board president will tally all merit rankings from the board members using
     the civilian board president tally sheet. The board president will only cast a tie-breaking
     vote. The nominee with the lowest total final merit rank order score is that board’s winner
     unless the board (including the president) unanimously votes to select a different
     nominee. This provision is intended to select the most deserving candidate as the winner
     and not to recognize winners based on nominator’s writing skills, for example.
     11.12.3. The board president will forward the completed tally sheet to 354 FW/CCCA
     for presentation coordination. 354 FW/CCCA will coordinate with each winning
     employee’s unit for completing award administrative actions for winners.
  11.13. Winner Recognition.
     11.13.1. Wing Annual Award Winners. The 354 FW/CCCA will ensure winner
     packages are prepared for approval by the wing commander and will coordinate purchase
     of the award. The wing commander will determine presentation format.
        11.13.1.1. Annual winners will receive the Civilian Achievement Medal.
            11.13.1.1.1. The 354 FW/CCC will task the winning employee’s unit to draft and
            coordinate the Civilian Achievement Medal package for the wing commander’s
            signature. The package will be comprised of an award staff summary sheet and a
            Civilian Achievement Medal certificate. The Civilian Personnel Section will
            provide the Civilian Achievement Medal. Reference AFI 36-1004 and AFPAM
            36-2861 for additional award documentation and filing instructions.
            11.13.1.1.2. The Civilian Achievement Medal is documented in the civilian data
            system, so 354 FW/CCCA will forward a copy of all documents to the Civilian
            Personnel Section. The award Staff Summary Sheet is filed in the employee's
            performance folder, so 354 FW/CCCA will also forward a copy to the employee’s
            squadron commander.
354FWI36-2802 17 OCTOBER 2013                                                             15


     11.13.2. Wing Quarterly Award Winners. The 354 FW/CCCA will ensure winner

            and coordinate the Letter of Commendation for the wing commander’s signature.
            The narrative of the Letter of Commendation will include the award of an 8 hour
            time off award.
            11.13.2.1.2. The time-off award is documented in the civilian data system, so 354
            FW/CCCA will forward a copy of all documents to the Civilian Personnel
            Section. The Letter of Commendation is filed in the employee's performance
            folder, so 354 FW/CCCA will also forward a copy to the employee’s squadron
            commander.
     11.13.3. Group and Squadron Quarterly and Annual Award Winners. Commanders
     are responsible for determining their unit’s recognition program. Commanders are
     encouraged to review AFPAM 36-2861, Civilian Recognition Guide, when defining their
     program. As a minimum, employees selected as a Group or Squadron quarterly award
     winner will receive an 8 hour time off award.
        11.13.3.1. The winning employee’s unit will draft a memorandum (or AF Form
        1001, for NAF employees) notifying the employee of the 8 hour time off award.
        11.13.3.2. The Time off award is documented in the civilian data system, so the
        employee’s unit will forward a copy of all documents to the Civilian Personnel
        Section. The memorandum is filed in the employee's performance folder.
     11.13.4. The Civilian Personnel Section may reduce Time-Off Awards to prevent an
     employee from exceeding 80 hours total for Time-Off Awards in a leave year. There will
     be no provisions to make up for lost Time-Off Awards in this circumstance.
