     course have been counseled and have signed their ADSC letter prior to enrolling the
     individual into a course, IAW AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service Commitments (ADSC). This
     function is delegated to the training unit registrar.
     4.1.2. For in-unit flying training, the appropriate flying squadron commander will:
        4.1.2.1. Ensure that all personnel scheduled for in-unit training, initial instructor, special
        mission upgrade, are counseled on the ADSC to be incurred upon the completion of
        subject training.
        4.1.2.2. Direct the individual to report to the military personnel flight (MPF) for official
        counseling and to sign their ADSC letter. The supporting MPF will issue a duplicate
        ADSC letter to the individual and the individual will return it to their appropriate
        squadron commander.
     4.1.3. For formal course (ETCA database) flying training of AFSOC personnel, AFSOTC
     will:
        4.1.3.1. Ensure that all personnel who are enrolled in formal course training receive
        ADSC counseling and sign their ADSC letter prior to the start of training.
4.2. Student In-Processing. The appropriate AFSOTC registrar is the OPR for in-processing
procedures. A representative from Flight Records will check the accuracy of student records.
In-processing for MC-130E students will be handled by the 711 SOS. The Registrar will check
student prerequisite completion, conduct student in-processing, complete required forms, and

4.3. Student Out-Processing. The Registrar will ensure that each student receives an Out-
Processing Checklist. The Registrar will ensure that students have completed all out-processing
actions. Students will not be issued an AF Form 1256, until out-processing is complete. The
goal is for students to be as close to mission ready and deployable as possible before out-
processing from the formal training course. Prerequisites for out-processing are completion of
academic/flying training, written and flight examinations. Completion of operational mobility
requirements does not constitute grounds for delay of graduation.
4.4. Student Training Progress Report. The AFSOTC will make a weekly status report on
student training progress to all gaining squadrons and HQ AFSOC/A3TA training manager to
manage and monitor the PFT execution.
4.5. Syllabus Waivers and Deviations. Refer to the appropriate syllabus for specific guidance:

   AFSOC/A3T. Update or change training syllabi through formal course review process.
   Appropriate AFSOTC, HQ AFSOC, and gaining unit representatives should be included in
   the review. Recommended syllabus changes should be routed through the AFSOTC with
   gaining unit coordination and HQ AFSOC/A3T approval. Changes that do not involve a
   level of effort change for the contractor or incur additional resources may be approved by the
   AFSOTC/CC or designated represented and will be coordinated the same as above during the
   normal revision process. These changes will be tracked in ―red-line‖ documents maintained
   at the AFSOTC and information will be disseminated to the instructor cadre via email or
   other means.
   4.5.3. Syllabus Waivers. A syllabus waiver is a planned one-time exception to the syllabus
   used to enhance or accommodate student training in special or unusual circumstances.
   Syllabus waivers are not intended to be permanent changes to a syllabus, but should be
   suggested as syllabus changes if a permanent change is warranted. Submit syllabus waiver
   requests in writing, including the rationale for the waiver using a memorandum for record.
   All waiver requests will be routed through AFSOTC, who will forward to HQ AFSOC/A3T.
   HQ AFSOC/A3T will approve or disapprove requests and forward a copy of approved
   waivers to AFSOTC/CC and the appropriate gaining unit training office. AFSOTC will
   maintain a record of all approved waivers for two years. Training requested in a syllabus
   waiver will not be accomplished until waiver approval is obtained.
   4.5.4. Approval Authority. Waiver approval authority for all AFSOTC flying training
   syllabus is HQ AFSOC/A3T. Waiver approval authority below AFSOC/A3T is not
   authorized.
   4.5.5. Waiver of Student Training. Only the AFSOTC/CC can release students from training
   prior to achieving course Required Proficiency Levels (RPLs) and only after coordination
   with the gaining unit commander and notification to HQ AFSOC. (HQ AFRC for AFRC
   students).
   4.5.6. Waiver of Prerequisites. HQ AFSOC/A3T (HQ AFRC for AFRC students) may only
   waive SOI experience prerequisites. All other prerequisites for training may be waived by
   the group commander or squadron commander. The approved waiver will be entered in the
16                                                               AFSOCI36-2202 27 JUNE 2009


     student’s training folder with appropriate justification and the Registrar will notify the
     appropriate flight commander. These waivers should not be granted routinely.
     4.5.7. Syllabus Deviations. A syllabus deviation is any unplanned variation from syllabus or
     equivalent directed requirement such as prerequisite flow, turn times, landing currency,
     minimum number of events, etc. Unless a waiver request is approved, all syllabus training
     must be accomplished. If unforeseen circumstances result in an omission of required
     training, the AFSOTC/CC will determine if the omitted training can be accomplished later in
     the syllabus flow, without adversely affecting the quality of student training. Document all
     syllabus deviations, AFSOTC/CC directed corrective actions, and accomplishment of the
     omitted training in the student’s training folder. However, AFSOTC/CC may, on a case-by-
     case review, authorize an intentional syllabus deviation in the interest of flying safety. All
     syllabus deviations will be documented and maintained in the student training folder.
4.6. Proficiency Advancement. Students may be proficiency advanced flights, ground training
sessions, or simulator missions on a case by case basis, if the RPL level is attained in that task.
The student’s flight commander, based on recommendations of the student’s instructor, can
approve proficiency advancement of two training events (ground training sessions, simulator
missions or flights). Proficiency advancement exceeding two training events must be approved
by the training unit DO or CC. Proficiency advancements are cumulative; advancements beyond
two training events total, for an entire phase of training requires training unit DO or CC
approval. Document proficiency advancement as follows:
     4.6.1. Instructor completes and signs an AF Form 4110, Comments – SOF/CSAR Training
     Record, including a recommendation for proficiency advancement. The flight commander
     will enter a separate write-up in the AF Form 4110, documenting concurrence/non-
     concurrence. If concurred with, the flight commander or instructor will line through the
     lesson on the AF Form 4111, SOF/CSAR Training Record.
     4.6.2. For proficiency advancements requiring training unit DO or CC approval, the DO or
     CC will review the recommendations and note concurrence or non-concurrence on the AF
     Form 4110.
     4.6.3. Student will initial below the concurring official's remarks on the AF Form 4110 to
     indicate acknowledgment of the proficiency advancement.
4.7. Student Class Changes. Students who require a break in training of more than 20 training
days, due to illness, injury, etc., will be considered for a move to a following class with a
realistic projected graduation date. The student flight commander will forward a letter through
unit commanders to the AFSOTC/CC and through all concerned agencies stating reasons,
training remaining, and requesting approval of the class change. In addition, the requesting
flight commander will notify the registrar of the proposed new graduation date.
4.8. Student Training Records or Electronic Equivalent:
     4.8.1. Student training records (AF Forms 4110 and 4111) will be assembled by the
     Registrar, distributed to instructors prior to the class start date (CSD), and maintained in the
     training unit or operational squadron until graduation. The Registrar will enter the new dates
     into MILPDS/OTA. Exception: MC-130E student training records are maintained at the
     711 SOS during flight training.
AFSOCI36-2202 27 JUNE 2009                                                                      17


   4.8.2. All student training grade folders will be forwarded to Registrar within five workdays
   after the student's graduation, elimination, or disenrollment from a course. After a thorough
   review, the student-training folder will be returned to the students' gaining unit.
   4.8.3. The AFSOTC will maintain student Training Information Files for a student who is
   disqualified for flying duties for 5 years after disqualification IAW AF Records Disposition
   Schedule (RDS), T13-10, R37.00.
4.9. Student Absentee Reporting. The instructor will initiate a Student Absentee Report on all
students who are late or absent for any reason for any scheduled training. These reports will be
filed in the student’s administrative folder. A copy of the absentee report will be sent to the
appropriate flight commander.
4.10. Student Counseling. Flight commanders (or higher authority) will document formal
counseling of students for other than academic or flying deficiency on AF Form 174, Record of
Individual Counseling. The counselor should maintain a copy of the completed AF Form 174,
give the individual a copy, and send the original to the training unit First Sergeant for enlisted
personnel or the Commander for officers. Document counseling associated with academic,
ATD, or flying deficiencies on an AF Form 4110 in the student's training record.
4.11. Airsickness and Visually Induced Motion Sickness (VIMS):
   4.11.1. If a student should experience incapacitating airsickness during a training sortie, the
   instructor will document the event on the AF Form 4110 for that sortie and refer the student
   to the Flight Surgeon at next opportunity in coordination with that student’s flight
   commander or primary instructor. Incapacitating airsickness includes ―active airsickness‖, in
   which the student experiences vomiting, and ―incapacitating passive airsickness‖, in which
   the student does not vomit but may experience nausea or disorientation to the point he or she
   is not capable of performing his or her duties during the sortie.
   4.11.2. The Flight Surgeon will apply internal airsickness protocol to proactively treat the
   source of the student’s airsickness. In the extremely rare instance where airsickness
   problems persist after following the Flight Surgeon’s airsickness protocol, a Second Level
   Progress Review will be held to determine if the student’s case will be forwarded to an FEB
   for removal from training. This does not apply to motion sickness that can be experienced in
   the simulator known as VIMS.
   4.11.3. If VIMS is so severe that no simulator training can be accomplished, the student will
   be referred to the Flight Surgeon for evaluation of alternatives. Because VIMS, in most
   cases, is unrelated to airsickness, students will not be considered for elimination based solely
   on episodes of VIMS.
   4.11.4. All cases of airsickness and VIMS will be entered in the student’s training folder on
   an AF Form 4110. The entry may be made within the comments for the mission on which
   the student experienced airsickness or VIMS.
4.12. First Level Progress Review. A First Level Progress Review (see Paragraph 6.2.) is a
detailed assessment by the appropriate flight commander of a student's training progress to
determine the effectiveness of training and the student's ability and desire to attain the RPLs
prior to remedial training or a Second Level Progress Review.
18                                                              AFSOCI36-2202 27 JUNE 2009


4.13. Second Level Progress Review. A Second Level Progress Review (see Paragraph 6.5.) is
a detailed assessment, by the operations officer or designated representative, of a student's
training progress to ensure that training provided to the student has been effective and the student
has the desire and ability to attain the RPLs. Failure to meet RPLs during remedial training
directed as a result of a Second Level Progress Review can result in the recommendation for a
Faculty Board or an FEB.
4.14. Remedial Training. This is additional training given after a student fails a measurement
or does not attain an RPL. Type and amount of training are recommended by the instructor,
flight commander, and/or this instruction during a Progress Review, and approved by the training
unit commander, operations officer, or designated representative as appropriate. This remedial
training will be completed prior to changing phases or proceeding in the course. If the student
requires a Progress Review due to failure of an evaluation flight, he/she will not be removed
from remedial training until the evaluation flight is passed:
     4.14.1. Academic. Additional training required to help the student attain an RPL will be
     documented in the training records to include the amount of time involved. Additional
     training will be coordinated through the primary instructor and applicable flight commander.
     4.14.2. ATD/Flying. Remedial training required to improve a student's performance
     following an Unsatisfactory (U) grade, to include ground training, will be documented in the
     training records. ATD or academic training will be used whenever possible prior to remedial
     aircraft flights. The following procedures apply to remedial training flights:
        4.14.2.1. The appropriate flight commander, or designated representative, will coordinate
        with the appropriate agency (operational squadron or training unit scheduler) to give the
        student the highest priority possible commensurate with other training requirements.
        4.14.2.2. Satisfactory student performance on remedial training sorties satisfies the
        original substandard training elements. All remedial training flight job elements will be
        graded. Usually, a maximum of two remedial training flights should be scheduled for
        any specific student deficiency.
        4.14.2.3. On the first remedial sortie, if the student performs satisfactorily in those
        previously identified deficiencies, the overall grade should be ―S‖ and further remedial
        sorties are not required.
        4.14.2.4. If subsequent remedial sorties are required, the grade for the initial sorties
        would be ―X‖, and the final sortie will be graded using normal grading procedures.
        4.14.2.5. If any sorties are graded ―U‖, the student will be scheduled for a second level
        progress review. Note: The first remedial training sortie will graded ―U‖ only if the
        student’s performance compromises safety to the extent that further flights are not
        recommended.
        4.14.2.6. Deficient job elements will be focused on during remedial sorties. However, a
        student will still be graded on all performed tasks throughout the mission. During a
        remedial sortie, a student may fall below a previously attained RPL on tasks not
        associated with the Unsatisfactory (U) grade that triggered the remedial training. In such
        cases, a student may receive a ―T‖ grade. Paragraph 5.2.3.3.9. describes such a scenario
        and grading procedures.
AFSOCI36-2202 27 JUNE 2009                                                                      19


   4.14.3. If the student satisfactorily completes remedial training and has attained the required
   proficiency level of performance, continue the student in the normal course of instruction.
4.15. Extra Sorties to Regain Proficiency (X-Rides). Flight commanders (or designated
representative) may authorize additional flights to regain proficiency following extended breaks
in training continuity or to allow a student to fly on sorties where syllabus job elements will not
be performed.
   4.15.1. X-Ride Conditions. Normally, a break of 14 calendar days since completing a
   training sortie in an individual phase of training is considered an extended break. However,
   if during a 14 day period since a complete sortie, a student received other training in an ATD,
   or flew sorties that were graded as Incomplete (I) and typical mission events were
   accomplished, then an X-Ride may not be necessary. Also, students early in a phase of
   training or those who have performed at a high level of proficiency during training may not
   need X-Rides. A student will receive an X-Ride if they exceed 30 days since completing a
   training sortie during an individual phase of training, unless waived by training unit
   commander or operations officer.
   4.15.2. X-Ride Procedures:
       4.15.2.1. The student’s flight commander (or designated representative) will make an
       entry on AF Form 4110 stating that the student is granted an X-Ride(s). The comments
       will include the reasons for needing the X-Ride. The student’s instructor may make the
       entry on AF Form 4110 with reasons stated and the flight commander (or designated
       representative) will note concurrence or non-concurrence. The student’s flight
       commander may authorize up to two consecutive X-Rides. Additional consecutive X-
       Rides will be granted at the discretion of the operations officer.
       4.15.2.2. The X-Ride(s) will consist of typical mission events consistent with the
       student’s phase of training. If primary job elements were missed, the student’s status will
       be ―I‖ in accordance with Paragraph 5.2.3.3.4.
       4.15.2.3. X-Rides will be referred to on the Flying Training Summary of the Aircrew
       Training Record (AF Form 4109) as ―X‖ followed by the number of which X-Ride it is
       for the student. For example, a student’s first X-Ride will be ―X-1‖; the second X-Ride
       will be ―X-2‖, and so on. A complete X-Ride will be graded as complete (C) or
       incomplete (I) followed by the reason.
       4.15.2.4. Instructors will make comments for all X-Rides on AF Form 4110. Instructors
       will thoroughly document all phases of the mission in the format detailed in Paragraph
       5.3.
       4.15.2.5. Events accomplished by the student on an X-Ride will be documented on the
       AF Form 4111, SOF/CSAR Training Record, for the student’s phase of training.
       Instructors will grade the student’s proficiency on tasks (for example: 1A, 2B, etc.). This
       indicates to future instructors what tasks the student accomplished on the X-Ride(s). If a
       student regresses in proficiency for a task on an X-Ride, this does not warrant a ―T‖
       status – the student is still graded ―X‖. Some regression in proficiency may be normal on
       an X-Ride, but this does not mean the student is entitled to an additional X-Ride for
       proficiency. The student will be graded normally on the next programmed training
       mission after completion of the X-Ride(s).
20                                                               AFSOCI36-2202 27 JUNE 2009


        4.15.2.6. If in the opinion of the student’s instructor administrating the X-Ride, the
        student is not at a proficiency level consistent with the level the student achieved prior to
        the break in training, additional X-Rides may be authorized by the student’s flight
        commander (or the operations officer if it would be more than two consecutive X-Rides).
        An entry on AF Form 4110 indicating this request will be signed by the flight
        commander or operations officer as appropriate.
4.16. Student Disenrollment or Elimination. Student disenrollment or elimination from a
formal flying course will be accomplished IAW AFI 11-402. The training unit is responsible for
ensuring that all training, evaluation, and counseling records have been properly prepared for an
FEB:
     4.16.1. A student may be administratively disenrolled by the AFSOC Form 391, Record of
     Administrative Action, for failure to maintain administrative requisites, or failure to maintain
     medical qualification, or failure to maintain professional standards as outlined in AFI 11-402.
     After all actions are complete, one copy of this form will be filed with the student's training
     records and out-processing actions from formal training will begin.
     4.16.2. Voluntary disenrollment will be IAW AFI 11-402.
4.17. PFT Student Overage Procedures. Operational units will submit a request for an
overage to the PFT student load through their respective Group to the SOG/CC for written
approval/disapproval and submission to HQ AFSOC/A3TA using an AFSOC Form 42, Program
Flying Training Request. HQ AFSOC/A3TA will enter the AFSOC Form 42 into the AFSOTC
coordination process. The training unit operations officer has final approval authority for any
changes that do not require any additional resources or change in scope; however, the
approved/disapproved AFSOC Form 42 must be routed through HQ AFSOC/A3TA so PFT
document and MILPDS/OTA changes can be made. If additional resources are required, the
training unit operations officer or designated representative will forward the completed form to
HQ AFSOC/A3T for approval and implementation or disapproval.
4.18. Student Performance Reports. Refer to AFI 36-2406, Officer and Enlisted Evaluation
Systems, for procedures on completing student performance reports.
AFSOCI36-2202 27 JUNE 2009                                                                     21


                                           Chapter 5

                  STUDENT RECORDS AND GRADING PROCEDURES

5.1. General. This chapter outlines additional procedures required by the AFSOTC to
accurately record formal aircrew student training using the AF Forms 4110, and 4111 or
electronic equivalents. The guidance contained in this publication amplifies and is in addition to
the instructions contained in AFI 11-401, AFI 11-2MC-130, Volumes 1-2, AFI 11-2AC-130,
Volumes 1-2, AFI 11-2U-28, Volumes 1-2 and future appropriate MDS specific AFIs outlining
training requirements.
5.2. Aircrew Training Record. The student’s training record will be available for instructor
use and reference during every training period:
   5.2.1. Ground Training Summary. The first entry in this area should indicate the date of
   completion of the academic phase. All ground training and simulators require an entry.
   Include entries for remedial ground training.
   5.2.2. Written Evaluations:
       5.2.2.1. Enter End-of-Block (EOB), End-of-Phase (EOP), End-of-Course (EOC), and
       STAN/EVAL examination scores. A minimum score of 85% is required for the student
       to pass each examination.
   5.2.3. Flying Training Summary. Each aircraft flight requires an entry:
       5.2.3.1. Date. Use the local date the mission started.
       5.2.3.2. Training Period. Use SOI training period designators.
       5.2.3.3. Status. Use the following codes to indicate student status:
           5.2.3.3.1. Satisfactory (S). The student met or exceeded all the listed RPLs for that
           training period. The student advances to the next programmed lesson or training
           period. Note: For flying training, ―S‖ is still the proper status code as long as the
           student has not regressed in a previously graded job element, and there are flying
           training periods remaining before the student must meet/exceed RPL.
           5.2.3.3.2. Training Record (T). The student fell below a previously attained RPL for
           one or more job elements. The job element was not graded below standard the last
           time it was graded and additional training periods that include that job element
           remain in that phase. The student advances to the next programmed lesson or training
           period.
           5.2.3.3.3. Unsatisfactory (U). The student fell below a previously attained RPL on
           the same job element for two consecutive training periods, or fell below the listed
           RPL on any job element and no training periods remain prior to an evaluation, or if
           dangerous tendencies are noted. Note: The student requires a progress review before
           scheduling any additional training.
           5.2.3.3.4. Incomplete (I). The overall grade will be an incomplete under one of the
           following conditions:
               5.2.3.3.4.1. Required training period job elements were not graded and the
22                                                       AFSOCI36-2202 27 JUNE 2009


        student has not previously attained the RPL of the missed job elements, and the
        RPL changes to a higher level on the next training period or it is the last training
        period in a block or phase. The student will repeat the lesson or training period.
        5.2.3.3.4.2. The student was graded "I" on the previous training period and the
        missed job element(s) could not be accomplished during the current training
        period. The student will repeat the lesson or training period. Note: If "I" is used,
        it will be followed by the reason. "MX" for a maintenance abort or delay. "OPS"
        for an operations abort or delay. ―SYM‖ for a sympathetic abort or delay, which
        is used when training with another asset or aircraft is required. ―WX‖ for a
        weather abort or delay. "IN" for student requirements being incompatible with
        the sortie being flown. ―PHY‖ for a physiological event. ―OTH‖ for reasons
        other than those stated here. All incomplete entries will be fully explained on the
        AF Form 4110.
     5.2.3.3.5. Training Record (T) or Unsatisfactory (U) on an Incomplete (I) sortie.
     Because a student may accomplish gradable tasks on an otherwise incomplete sortie,
     the student may receive a ―T‖ or a ―U‖ status on an incomplete sortie given the
     following conditions:
        5.2.3.3.5.1. The student fell below previously attained RPL for one or more job
        elements, the job element was not graded below standard the last time it was
        graded, and the student would otherwise receive an ―I‖ for other missed job
        element(s). In this case the student would receive a ―T/I‖ followed by the reason
        for the incomplete sortie (MX, WX, OPS, IN, PHY, OTH, or SYM). For
        example, the student may receive a ―T/I-WX‖. The student will repeat the lesson
        or training period.
        5.2.3.3.5.2. The student fell below a previously attained RPL on the same job
        element for two consecutive training periods, or if dangerous tendencies are
        noted, and the student would otherwise receive an ―I‖ for other missed job
        element(s). In this case the student would receive a ―U/I‖ followed by the reason
        for the incomplete sortie (MX, WX, OPS, IN, PHY, OTH, or SYM). For
        example, the student may receive a ―U/I-WX‖. The student requires a progress
        review before scheduling any additional training. If remedial training is
        prescribed and successfully accomplished, the student will then repeat the lesson
        or training period.
     5.2.3.3.6. Proficiency Advancement (P). Proficiency advancement is awarded in lieu
     of actual job element accomplishment when warranted by student's previous
     performance and knowledge. The student advances to the next programmed lesson or
     training period. See Paragraph 4.6. for detailed procedures.
     5.2.3.3.7. Exceptional (E). The student met or exceeded all RPLs and events in an
     exceptional manner.
     5.2.3.3.8. Other (X). Flight commanders may authorize additional flights to allow
     students to regain proficiency following extended breaks in training continuity or to
     allow a student to fly on sorties where syllabus job elements will not be performed.
     These sorties will be graded ―X‖.
AFSOCI36-2202 27 JUNE 2009                                                                    23


        5.2.3.3.9. Unusual Circumstances. In some instances, there may be conflicting
        guidance on what a student’s status should be after a training sortie due to various
        grading scenarios. Use the following guidance for such situations. In instances that
        are not covered below or elsewhere within this instruction, consult with the course
        manager, student’s flight commander, ADO, or DO for guidance. Document on AF
        Form 4110 the prescribed course of action for grading.
            5.2.3.3.9.1. In the event a student is graded ―U‖ for reasons stated in Paragraph
            5.2.3.3.3., but the student fell below a previously attained RPL for other job
            elements that would otherwise require a ―T‖ status, the student is graded ―U‖ and
            will be allowed until the end of prescribed remedial training (if any is given) to
            bring that additional downgraded task back up to the previously attained RPL.
            Failure to do so will result in another ―U‖. Should remedial sorties be prescribed,
            then the student will still be graded ―X‖ as necessary on the initial remedial
            sorties IAW Paragraph 4.14.2.4.
            5.2.3.3.9.2. If a student should fall below a previously attained RPL during any
            remedial training, the student will be allowed until the end of remedial training to
            bring the grade for that task back up to the previously attained RPL. Refer to
            Paragraph 5.2.3.3.9.3. if this should happen on the last remedial training sortie or
            event. The student is graded ―T/X‖ for that mission to indicate that he or she fell
            below a previously attained RPL for one or more job elements not associated with
            the original unsatisfactory grade, and the student moves on to the next remedial
            training sortie. Failure to bring that additional downgraded task back up to the
            previously attained RPL by the end of prescribed remedial training will result in
            an unsatisfactory ―U‖ grade.
            5.2.3.3.9.3. If a student should fall below a previously attained RPL on the final
            remedial training sortie on a job element not associated with the original
            unsatisfactory grade, and the student performs satisfactorily on deficient tasks that
            triggered the original unsatisfactory grade, and regular training flights remain
            before the end of the phase, the student is then graded ―T‖ and moves on to the
            next programmed lesson or training period. Note: Remedial training will be
            annotated the same as the deficient academic, simulator, or flying lesson followed
            by an "R" (Example: T4-R-1, T4-R-2, etc).
     5.2.3.4. Instructor/Trainer (Qual). Enter the last name and the crew qualification.
     5.2.3.5. Mission Time. Enter the total flight time of the training mission in the top half
     of the block and the time that the student actually received instruction (seat time) in the
     bottom half of the block. If more than one mission is completed on a flight, proportion
     the time to each mission.
     5.2.3.6. Cumulative Time. Enter total cumulative flight time in the top half of the block
     and total cumulative instruction time (seat time) in the bottom half of the block.
     5.2.3.7. Use a separate line to record each mission profile accomplished or canceled after
     student and instructor arrival.
24                                                               AFSOCI36-2202 27 JUNE 2009


     5.2.4. Performance Evaluation Summary. Include only simulator and flying evaluations.
     The training unit Operations Officer or designated representative will review and initial the
     records prior to the evaluation.
     5.2.5. The appropriate flight commander will enter anything that interrupts training
     (Example: DNIF or emergency leave.) Enter the date and time the training was stopped and
     restarted.
5.3. AF Form 4110, Comments – SOF/CSAR Training Record:
     5.3.1. Instructors or flight examiners will make comments for all training sessions or flights.
     Generalized comments, such as "Student made several minor errors on preflight that were
     corrected by the instructor," are not acceptable. Specific errors must be documented. The
     format for comments is:
        5.3.1.1. Profile.
        5.3.1.2. Strengths.
        5.3.1.3. Weaknesses.
        5.3.1.4. Recommendations.
     5.3.2. Instructors and instructor candidates will sign below entered comments and print their
     rank and last name below their signature.
     5.3.3. Students will initial below the comments for each entry to indicate they have read and
     understood the instructor’s remarks.
     5.3.4. Each scheduled training session involving either a simulator or aircraft that is canceled
     after student and instructor have arrived, will be documented in the AF Form 4110 and AF
     Form 4109, SOF/CSAR Aircrew Training Record, (no entry is required in the AF Form 4111,
     unless training was accomplished).
5.4. AF Form 4111, SOR/CSAR Training Record:
     5.4.1. The AF Form 4111 overprints will be published to define performance task listings,
     training profiles, and RPLs in accordance with the respective SOI Document. HQ
     AFSOC/A3T approves AF Form 4111 overprints.
     5.4.2. Performance and Knowledge Grade. The instructor will indicate the RPL attained by
     the student on each required job element by printing the RPL in the appropriate column and
     row. For those AF Forms 4111 with preprinted RPLs, if the student meets the RPL, slash
     through the grade. If a higher or lower RPL is met, write that RPL over the preprinted one.
     If the job element contains an RPL of "R" (review) and the student maintained the previously
     attained RPL, slash through the "R".
     5.4.3. Use the appropriate AF Form 4111 when training is accomplished. Ground training
     should have a separate AF Form 4111 from simulator and flying mission profiles. For each
     AF Form 4111 column entry, enter comments on the AF Form 4110 to describe what training
     was accomplished.
     5.4.4. When mission profiles or events have to be re-flown, use a blank column to log the
     mission profile events and write in the attained RPL.
AFSOCI36-2202 27 JUNE 2009                                                                             25


     5.4.5. Minimum Events:
        5.4.5.1. The minimum events column is used when it is necessary for the student to
        perform, or be exposed to, an event or task more than once on any given mission or series
        of missions.
        5.4.5.2. When used, the total number of events/tasks required will be listed in the
        minimum events column on the line of the task to which it pertains. Each course should
        have a standardized method for tracking the cumulative minimum events accomplished
        and remaining.
        5.4.5.3. If a specific number of events are not required on a particular mission profile,
        the instructor will enter the achieved RPL on the task line.
        5.4.5.4. Minimum events can be proficiency advanced with appropriate approval if the
        required RPL has been met (see Paragraph 4.6.).
        5.4.5.5. If the minimum number of events has not been completed by the last scheduled
        training flight for that mission profile, then the student is "Incomplete" and another flight
        must be scheduled to complete that event.
5.5. Sortie/Flying Requirements. Each SOI addresses the RPLs required to be attained for
each task trained during the flying phase, the programmed sorties for each crew position and
course, and the predicted flying hours required.
5.6. Grading Standards:
     5.6.1. Grading Criteria. Instructors will determine both individual mission element grades
     and the overall mission grade by assessing the student's performance against the SOI defined
     RPLs.
     5.6.2. Course Training Standards. Course training standards describe the minimum overall
     performance levels required to progress and graduate from a course. Each syllabus lists the
     course training standards that students must achieve for each sortie or block of sorties before
     progressing to subsequent training.

                                            Chapter 6

             PROGRESS REVIEW AND FACULTY BOARD PROCEDURES

6.1. General. This chapter outlines procedures for managing AFSOTC students who are
making less than satisfactory progress in training. All instructors (regardless of unit of
assignment) are required to follow these procedures for students receiving training through the
AFSOTC.
   6.1.1. During any progress review, if any contractual issues (contract instructors,
   courseware, scheduling, etc.) are judged to be a contributing factor, contact the unit PO/QAR
   to coordinate corrective actions.
6.2. First Level Progress Review. See Attachment 3 for checklist. The flight commander or
designated representative will conduct a First Level Progress Review whenever a student does
one of the following:
   6.2.1. Fails a practical exercise.
   6.2.2. Fails an EOB examination.
   6.2.3. Fails an EOP examination.
   6.2.4. Fails an EOC examination.
   6.2.5. Fails a STAN/EVAL examination.
   6.2.6. Fails an ATD or flight evaluation.
   6.2.7. Fails to upgrade from a Q-2 evaluation.
   6.2.8. Fails to show progress during a training phase.
   6.2.9. Falls below the same task element RPL on two consecutive flights for which the
   student had previously acquired a satisfactory proficiency.
   6.2.10. Receives an overall unsatisfactory grade on a ground training mission, simulator or
   flying training mission.
   6.2.11. Fails to meet all RPLs on the last flight of the syllabus, prior to a scheduled
   evaluation.
   6.2.12. Exhibits safety of flight violations.
   6.2.13. Requests to self-eliminate.
   6.2.14. Fails to meet the RPLs for an End-of-Phase flight.
6.3. First Level Progress Review Training Folder Entry. When any of the items listed in
Paragraph 6.2. occur, the instructor or examiner will make an entry on AF Form 4110 to include
a statement of failure (include relevant conditions), any associated problems, and any additional
training recommendations. This entry may be part of the AF Form 4110 comments for the
associated flight, simulator mission, or ground training session that triggered the First Level
Progress Review. The instructor will debrief the student’s status to the student’s primary
instructor, Flight Commander, or their designated representative.
28                                                                 AFSOCI36-2202 27 JUNE 2009


6.4. First Level Progress Review Procedures:
     6.4.1. The flight commander or designated representative conducting the progress review
     meets with the student and instructor or examiner to review the student's progress. Brief the
     student on his/her status using the Decision Logic Table (Table 8.1.). Document
     observations and recommendations on AF Form 4110. Advise the training unit ADO and/or
     DO of recommendations.
        6.4.1.1. Multiple First Level Progress Reviews may be accomplished for a student.
        Typically, a student will be allowed one First Level Progress Review for each phase of
        training they go through (Basic Qual, Basic Tac, Advanced Tac). However, if a student
        has received a First Level Progress Review in an earlier phase of training and does one of
        the items listed in paragraph 6.5. in a later phase of training that is consistent with that
        earlier phase, the student will then receive a Second Level Progress Review. For
        example, a student is graded unsatisfactory in the Advanced Tac phase for failing to
        perform tasks they were to have mastered in the Basic Qual phase, and a First Level
        Progress Review was accomplished for that student in the Basic Qual phase, then a
        Second Level Progress Review will be accomplished. In the event of unusual
        circumstances in training, such as an extended break for medical reasons, or restarting
        training altogether, the training unit DO may approve another First Level Progress
        Review if needed. Approval for an additional First Level Progress Review will be
        documented on the AF Form 4110 for that review.
     6.4.2. The training unit DO or designated representative will review the recommendations
     and note concurrence or non-concurrence on the AF Form 4110.
     6.4.3. The Flight Commander will:
        6.4.3.1. Direct follow-on actions (for example, remedial training, proficiency flights,
        Second Level Progress Review, and so forth), document the actions on an AF Form 4110,
        and ensure the appropriate scheduler is notified of follow-on actions.
        6.4.3.2. Ensure any remedial training is accomplished before the student continues with
        the course as detailed in Table 8.1. This training must be documented in accordance with
        Paragraph 4.14. of this instruction. If the student satisfactorily completes remedial
        training and has attained the required level of performance, continue the student in the
        normal course of instruction. If the student has not attained the prescribed standards
        upon completion of any remedial training, conduct a Second Level Progress Review.
6.5. Second Level Progress Review. See Attachment 4 for checklist. A Second Level
Progress Review will be conducted by the training unit DO (or designated representative) when a
student:
     6.5.1. Fails a second time to attain a satisfactory grade on a practical exercise.
     6.5.2. Continues to make unsatisfactory progress following a previous Progress Review for
     the same or associated deficiencies.
     6.5.3. Fails to attain a satisfactory grade on a remedial simulator or flying lesson.
     6.5.4. Fails a second ATD or flight evaluation.
     6.5.5. Fails remedial academic training.
AFSOCI36-2202 27 JUNE 2009                                                                     29


   6.5.6. Fails an EOB, EOP or EOC examination for a second time.
   6.5.7. Requests to self-eliminate following a First Level Progress Review.
   6.5.8. Is recommended by their course manager or flight commander for a Second Level
   Progress Review for any other reason not previously mentioned.
6.6. Second Level Progress Review Training Folder Entry. When any of the items listed in
Paragraph 6.5. occur, the instructor or flight examiner will make an entry on AF Form 4110 to
include a statement of failure (include relevant conditions), any associated problems, and any
additional training recommendations, if deemed necessary. This entry may be part of the AF
Form 4110 comments for the associated flight, simulator mission, or ground training session that
triggered the Second Level Progress Review. The instructor will debrief the student's status to
student’s primary instructor and Flight Commander, or their designated representative:
   6.6.1. The Flight commander, primary instructor, or their designated representative will
   notify the training unit CC and DO of the student’s status.
6.7. Second Level Progress Review Procedures:
   6.7.1. The training unit DO (or designated representative) will:
       6.7.1.1. Conduct the Second Level Progress Review. Meet with the student, instructor(s)
       or examiner involved, and flight commander to review the student’s progress.
       6.7.1.2. Interview the student. Suggested questions might be, but are not limited to:
           6.7.1.2.1. Medical problems.
           6.7.1.2.2. Personal problems.
           6.7.1.2.3. Sleeping problems.
           6.7.1.2.4. Problems studying.
           6.7.1.2.5. Educational level.
           6.7.1.2.6. Study habits.
           6.7.1.2.7. Testing problems.
           6.7.1.2.8. Problems in reading or math comprehension.
           6.7.1.2.9. Student’s evaluation of instruction and instructors.
           6.7.1.2.10. Amount of remedial training requested and received.
           6.7.1.2.11. Student’s evaluation of his/her performance during training.
       6.7.1.3. Provide an opportunity for Progress Review members to interview the student.
       6.7.1.4. Allow student to respond to questions.
       6.7.1.5. Provide the student an opportunity to speak openly about his training.
       6.7.1.6. Document observations and recommendations on AF Form 4110. Prescribed
       remedial training will not normally exceed two flights or two simulator missions. Note:
       Other personnel may be included. Brief the student on his/her status using Table 8.1.
30                                                                AFSOCI36-2202 27 JUNE 2009


        6.7.1.7. Notify training unit DO (if designated representative), training unit CC,
        appropriate scheduler (if required), and the training unit registrar (if appropriate) of
        recommendations and actions.
        6.7.1.8. Coordinate with the student’s flight commander and/or course director to direct
        additional follow-on actions (remedial training, training date limits, Faculty Board, FEB,
        etc).
     6.7.2. The training unit CC (or designated representative) will:
        6.7.2.1. Review the training unit DO’s (or designated representative) recommendations
        following the conclusion of the Second Level Progress Review and note concurrence or
        non-concurrence on the same AF Form 4110.
     6.7.3. If elimination is recommended following the Second Level Progress Review, a
     Faculty Board, or an FEB will be convened.
6.8. Final Progress Review. If a Second Level Progress Review has been conducted and the
student has not attained the prescribed standards upon completion of remedial training, a Final
Progress Review will be conducted to review the student’s training. All progress reviews
beyond a Second Level Progress Review within an individual phase of training will be referred
to as a Final Progress Review. They will be conducted and documented in same manner as a
Second Level Progress Review. Typically, elimination is recommended at the Final Progress
Review. Further remedial training past the Final Progress Review must be approved by the
school commandant (AFSOTC/CC). If elimination is recommended following the Second Level
Progress Review or subsequent Final Progress Review, a Faculty Board or an FEB will be
convened. Note: Faculty Boards and FEBs for AFRC/ANG students will be handled by the
respective squadrons.
     6.8.1. Training squadron Student Instruction Flights will:
        6.8.1.1. Notify Flight Management as soon as a student is suspended from flying or the
        student requests self-elimination from training.
        6.8.1.2. Forward the student’s grade book to the Student Management Flight when
        progress review board minutes, training summary report, and 4110 entry are signed and
        in the training folder.
     6.8.2. Training unit Student Management Flight will:
        6.8.2.1. Coordinate for a Faculty Board IAW this instruction, or an FEB (IAW AFI 11-
        402).
        6.8.2.2. Manage students during casual status.
        6.8.2.3. Coordinate for retraining as required.
        6.8.2.4. Build elimination folder for coordination IAW Attachment 5.
6.9. Faculty Board. Students who have never accomplished a formal Mission Qualification
evaluation (no AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, mission check) are eligible for a
Faculty Board. Final approval authority for a Faculty Board is the AFSOTC/CC. All rated
students will follow the procedures outlined in AFI 11-402 for an FEB. See Attachment 6 for
details on preparing for and conducting the Faculty Board.
AFSOCI36-2202 27 JUNE 2009                                                                   31


  6.9.1. Procedures When the Student Waives the Faculty Board. When a student is
  recommended for elimination and chooses to voluntarily waive the Faculty Board, the
  following procedures apply. Note: Waiving the Faculty Board constitutes that the student
  agreed with the Second Level or Final Level Progress Review Board decision.
     6.9.1.1. The training Unit/CC (or designated representative) will:
         6.9.1.1.1. Notify the gaining squadron commander and AFSOTC/CC.

                                           Chapter 9

          CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT, REVISION AND MAINTENANCE

9.1. General. This chapter outlines the process, procedures and responsibilities for the training
program, including the PFT, SOIs, CCDs, and courseware development, revision, maintenance
and control.
9.2. Scope. This paragraph applies to anyone involved with the development and management
of the AFSOTC formal training program, including initial development, evaluations,
implementation, and revisions. SOI configuration management is a systematic approach to
identify and control courses in development and of existing, baseline SOIs. AFSOTC is the
focal point for all aircrew SOI development, updates, and configuration management in AFSOC.
The flying and operational support squadrons and supporting contractor(s) are the offices of
collateral responsibility (OCR). AFSOTC specific positions and roles in the lesson development,
revision, and maintenance process (not to be interpreted as comprehensive job descriptions) are
as follows:
   9.2.1. Curriculum Flight Commander. Manages daily activities of all training programs.
   Serves as alternate chairperson on the Training Change Board. Resolves training procedure
   issues. Coordinates courseware lesson development process. Manages SOI update process
   for each weapon system.
   9.2.2. Course Manager. The CM will usually be the incumbent Government Contractor.
   Serves as academic course manager responsible for developing specific course content for
   the complete weapon system course. Based on overall course objectives reflected in the
   current, HQ AFSOC/A3T approved SOI, is responsible for choice of topics, subject-matter
   content, course organization, and emphasis. Coordinates lesson development with active
   duty and contractor counterparts. May also serve as lead subject matter expert. Other roles
   and responsibilities are covered in the appropriate sections below.
   9.2.3. Lead Instructor/Subject Matter Expert. Active Duty or Reserve instructor positions.
   Provides technical expertise to the training program. Updates SOI for their crew position.

38                                                              AFSOCI36-2202 27 JUNE 2009


     9.2.7. Lesson Subject Matter Expert (LSME). Normally contractor instructor positions.
     Serves as a training instructor responsible for the direct delivery of instruction or training
     services of an aircrew nature. Assists in developing and maintaining lesson material by
     providing technical expertise in their weapon system area. LSME and active duty
     counterpart will review all their respective crew position lessons annually for accuracy and
     currency IAW the AFSOTC Lesson Review Checklist.
     9.2.8. Training Developer. Coordinates lesson development within courseware system.
     Incorporates changes from course manager/LSME into the Instructor Guide (IG) and Media
     for each lesson.
9.3. Programmed Flying Training Document. The purpose of the PFT is to provide the
courses, classes and class dates, student quotas, and production schedules for the USAF flying
training program conducted by the AFSOTC. The PFT also includes the resource requirements
for planning and achieving training objectives. Class length, instructor, aircrew training devices,
and flying hour requirements are computed using current training program and environmental
factors. The flying hours and aircraft listed in the PFT should not be used in lieu of those
allocated in the approved documents, unless otherwise directed by Headquarters USSOCOM:
     9.3.1. The AFSOTC will support HQ AFSOC/A3T in the development, publishing, and
     distribution of the PFT. The AFSOTC will review requirements and validate capacity and
     provide shortfall report for requirements that AFSOTC is unable to support. AFSOTC will
     convert the Graduate Program Guidance Letter received by HAF/A3O-AT into the
     executable PFT document. Reviews will be accomplished at least quarterly.
9.4. Syllabus of Instruction. There will be an AFSOTC-developed, configuration-managed,
and HQ AFSOC/A3T approved SOI for all aircrew courses (including mission qualification,
upgrade training, continuation training, refresher training, and local SOW instructor training and
orientation). The SOI describes a training course from prerequisite entry requirements to award
of the certificate of course completion and AFSC. The SOI contains an organized number listing
of the tasks, conditions, and standards required to meet the student training objectives as
identified by AFSOTC customers and supported by the appropriate front-end analysis (FEA). It
will describe all training events and clearly delineate the length of training, the training systems
used, and all other pertinent requirements. A numbering system is used to identify information
throughout all other instructional documents and courseware. The central document within an
approved SOI is the Training Task List (TTL). It includes the entire spectrum of tasks in each
functional area (i.e. weapon system crew position) requiring training. The Course Lesson Map
(CLM) is an attachment to the SOI and ensures the required lessons are sequenced in the proper
learning hierarchy and along with lesson prerequisites, determines the lesson flow. The CLM is
a living document, and will change as lessons are added, removed or when the sequence changes.
TMS should be used for the latest CLM information. Whenever significant changes to CLM are
finalized, AFSOTC will coordinate and approve them. The approved version will then be placed
in the configuration management system replacing the previous version.
     9.4.1. SOI Procedures. SOIs in the development process require careful configuration
     management to ensure that a systematic and well-organized approach is used to define,
     develop, and maintain all syllabus curricula changes to already developed SOIs. Updates and
     revisions are periodically required to maintain the relevancy of instruction and to meet
AFSOCI36-2202 27 JUNE 2009                                                                39


  changing mission requirements. These changes will be accomplished via an update to the
  existing TTL:
     9.4.1.1. All group aircrew SOIs will be produced, developed, and revised IAW the
     provisions of the ISD process as defined by AFH 36-2235, Volumes 1 through 11. The
     AFSOTC will provide the ATARS contract Courseware Lead with a TTL created by the
     appropriate training unit Course Director (active duty or Reserve Air Force instructor).
     AFSOTC IDs will then (IAW the ISD process), analyze and determine what instruction is
     needed, design instruction to meet the need, and develop instructional materials to
     support system requirements. The SOI should be developed to support the Air Force
     Mission Essential Task List (METL), which is maintained at HQ AFSOC/A3T, and the
     AFSOTC provided TTL. Evaluation is a central function and will take place in every
     phase of the SOI development and revision process.
     9.4.1.2. AFSOTC draft SOIs will be labeled as ―DRAFT‖. Once the initial SOI
     development process is complete, coordination copies will be circulated to HQ
     AFSOC/A3T via electronic means for initial review. Following HQ AFSOC/A3T
     review, the SOI will then be forwarded to the AFSOTC/CC using an AF Form 1768, Staff
     Summary Sheet, for final approval signature. The AFSOTC will then coordinate full
     operational implementation and distribution. All coordination will have a posted
     suspense date. Every effort should be made to finalize action by the posted suspense
     date. However, if the agency is unable to complete their review by the posted suspense
     date, the AFSOTC/CC should be informed in order to determine what internal AFSOTC
     actions may be required due to SOI approval delays.
     9.4.1.3. SOI Baseline. After the SOI development is complete and approved by HQ
     AFSOC/A3T and AFSOTC/CC, a course baseline is established. Configuration
     management procedures will ensure that no unauthorized changes to the baseline SOI can
     be made. ―Read only‖, electronic copies of the SOIs will be maintained on the AFSOTC
     website. A paper copy will be maintained in the library.
     9.4.1.4. SOI Red-Line. Any minor modification to the baseline SOI that does not change
     the requirements or resources required to train can be approved training unit DO or
     designated representative. These changes to the baseline document will be noted in the
     control documents maintained by AFSOTC and the changes will be disseminated to the
     instructor cadre by all means available.
  9.4.2. SOI, Hierarchy of Objectives, and Course Reviews. These reviews and revisions will
  be accomplished annually or as changes justify. SOI task and Hierarchy of Objectives
  changes will be identified and tracked throughout the year in order to ensure they are
  considered in the next revision. As a minimum, the course described by the SOI, Hierarchy
  of Objectives, and CCD, will be evaluated for the following:
     9.4.2.1. Flight safety related changes.
     9.4.2.2. Currency of Instruction. Do changes in AFSOC requirements or aircraft
     modifications require SOI changes?
     9.4.2.3. Improvement of Instruction. Can the SOI (course) be changed to improve the
     student training? Feedback from the external and internal grad/eval program should be
     considered.
40                                                              AFSOCI36-2202 27 JUNE 2009


        9.4.2.4. Archive Materials. Are the SOI task(s) still valid? If not, supporting lessons
        should be archived for possible future or in-unit use.
        9.4.2.5. Archive the SOI. Is the SOI (course) being taught?
        9.4.2.6. Changes to Devices. Are there additions or changes to aircraft that impact
        training devices and systems, or are the systems being upgraded for better instruction?
        9.4.2.7. Changes to the SOI Tasks.       Are there changes to the SOI tasks or to the
        knowledge and skill requirements?
9.5. Courseware. Courseware generally consists of two major, deliverable elements, Instructor
Guide, and presentation media (viewgraphs, CBI modules, computer-generated multi-media
presentations, etc). A key document required to maintain the configuration of courseware is the
SOI Task-Lesson Objectives Linking Document. It contains a listing of all lesson objectives and
the associated SOI task or subtasks the lesson objective supports:
     9.5.1. Courseware will be developed to provide effective training to students. The key to
     providing effective training is defining and developing comprehensive lesson objectives,
     which are based on identified tasks, skills, and knowledge requiring training. All
     Student/Instructor Guides and media will be developed in support of learning objectives,
     which are traceable back to the pertinent SOI.
     9.5.2. Instructional Designers, Curriculum Administrator, and LSMEs will participate in
     courseware development and will ensure strict adherence to traceability of information from
     the SOI task list, through the lesson objectives, to the final instructional product.
     9.5.3. IAW DODI 1322.20, Development and Management of Interactive Courseware (ICW)
     for Military Training, DITIS procedures will be followed prior to development of any new
     CBI, Interactive Courseware (ICW), and courseware. CBI lessons will be recorded with
     DITIS.
     9.5.4. Academic and flying instructors are the Lesson Subject Matter Experts (LSMEs). The
     LSMEs are the primary content specialists for individual lessons (e.g., engines, fuel systems,
     navigation equipment, Instrument Refresher Course, etc.) they teach or supervise teaching.
     Each time, prior to teaching, annually, or as directed by the curriculum flight commander, the
     LSME will review the lesson(s) for which he or she is the designated LSME. TMS will be
     updated to reflect this review IAW Paragraph 13 of this instruction.
     9.5.5. Courseware quality control is built into the courseware development process from the
     beginning; not inspected at the end. AFSOTC government Quality Assurance personnel will
     accomplish a Physical Configuration Audit (PCA) prior to final delivery of a lesson. They
     will sample, at their discretion, processes, procedures and products to determine if all
     required elements of the lesson are accounted for, i.e., SOI Task-Lesson Objectives Linking
     Document, Instructor/Student Guide, and Media. Quality Assurance representatives will also
     monitor the effectiveness and overall quality of the curriculum, courseware materials and
     training during scheduled classroom and device-based training.
9.6. Training Change Proposal (TCP) Process. The TCP process will be handled in
accordance with the ATARS II Training Plan, Section 4.1. and the latest guidance in the
AFSOTC Operating Instructions (OIs). Training changes from outside the training unit will be
submitted on AFSOC Form 42.
AFSOCI36-2202 27 JUNE 2009                                                                      41


9.7. Flight Safety Changes. Flight safety-related SOI or courseware changes will be initiated
for resolution within 48-duty hours of notification of change. Flight safety items shall be
presented to AFQAR and the curriculum flight commander for approval, if necessary. All
personnel should notify the ATARS Courseware Lead of safety-related TCTO impacts
immediately upon receipt of the TCTO or message. Updates to courseware are required prior to
the next time the affected class(es) is/are taught.
9.8. Student Study Guides (SSG). All SSGs will be configuration-managed. LSMEs are
responsible for ensuring the most current and technically accurate information is contained in
SSGs, to include reading assignments:
   9.8.1. The SSG will be created IAW the ATARS Training Plan, Section 4.4. and maintained
   by CM. The Student Learning Center Custodian will reproduce and distribute it to students
   entering each new class.
9.9. Format and Style Guides. All Format and Style Guide changes must follow a thorough
review process and changes agreed to by the parties involved. A copy of the agreed to guides
will be provided to AFQAR for review. Format and Style Guides will be reviewed and updated,
as necessary:
   9.9.1. All courseware and media development will conform to the approved Format and
   Style Guides.
9.10. Quality Assurance. Quality Assurance representatives will monitor the effectiveness and
overall quality of the curriculum, courseware, and training during scheduled classroom, aircraft
static, and device-based training to ensure that the most current courseware version is being used
and that the intent of the configuration management system is being implemented.
9.11. Configuration Management (CM). CM will maintain all delivered and baselined
courseware and curriculum materials. This process is designed to ensure that courseware
configuration is maintained as changes to aircraft, guidance instructions, and procedures occur:
   9.11.1. CM will store the delivered lessons on electronic media in the configuration
   management system and a copy will be maintained in the courseware library for the
   instructors' use.
   9.11.2. Upon approval by AFQAR, CM will provide copies of baselined lessons on CD-
   ROM. Requester will provide lesson number and lesson title or sufficient information to
   identify the materials. Requester will also state whether the need is for one time only or if
   they should be added to the distribution list. When the AFSOTC website is developed,
   baselined lessons (read only) will be available and the need for CD-ROM copies will
   normally no longer be required.
9.12. Small Group Tryout (SGTO). The purpose of conducting SGTOs is to determine if the
instruction and materials work under actual conditions. The first time a new or highly revised
lesson is taught, a SGTO will be accomplished, the lesson will be delivered to AFQAR for final
review before the lesson can be used for SGTO, if required, or base lined for use in training.
Once a lesson has successfully undergone a Physical Configuration Audit (PCA) and is approved
by AFQAR, the lesson is baselined and approved for use. The SGTO is part of the formative
evaluation phase of instructional design. It is a review to ensure that the intent of the lesson as
described by the lesson objectives is accomplished. The SGTO verifies that the lesson flows
42                                                              AFSOCI36-2202 27 JUNE 2009


smoothly and that the time allotted is appropriate. If the SGTO cannot be accomplished within
115 days after delivery as part of the normal scheduling process, a special class will be requested
to accomplish the review:
     9.12.1. Lessons will be stored in the library pending SGTO, and maintained in binders
     labeled specifically for SGTO. The librarian will notify the LSME, Scheduler, and
     Curriculum Administrator when a SGTO required lesson has been delivered. Lessons will
     not be added to the CM baseline until successful completion of the SGTO.
9.13. Course Readiness Review (CRR). The CRR is a review of all aspects that make up a
course of instruction. While the SGTO looks at individual lessons, the CRR reviews the entire
course. The CRR ensures that the SOI training task requirements are accomplished at the
knowledge and skill level required and to ensure the hierarchy of objectives is satisfied. If
SGTOs are accomplished on each lesson in the course, a CRR has also been completed.
AFSOCI36-2202 27 JUNE 2009                                                                       43

                       STUDENT EXAMINATION PROCEDURES

10.1. General. Standardized procedures for the development, revision, and security of student
examinations are an essential part of the ISD process and important to the evaluation of both
examinee and the course.
   10.1.1. AFSOTC is responsible for flying training academic course examinations. The
   minimum passing score is 85 percent unless noted otherwise. A course-qualified instructor
   will administer all examinations. During examinations, instructors will only answer
   questions to clarify the meaning of questions or answers. Instructors should avoid answering
   in a manner that changes students’ confidence in an answer or directs a path for problem
   resolution. Anything said to one student should be shared with the entire class.
   10.1.2. When required by contract, government tests will also be used to conduct annual
   testing of AFSOTC contract instructors (CI).
10.2. Preparation of Examinations. AFSOTC Courseware Developers, Course Managers, and
Course Directors will prepare and administer student examinations and ensure that all course
tasks and objectives are tested in the examination, excluding familiarization training. Student
Form 8 examinations will be prepared and administered by SOG/OGVs.
   10.2.1. Written Examinations:
       10.2.1.1. Ensure that the cover page lists equipment (maps, supplementary documents, or
       computer-aided podium, etc.) required for the examination and the time allowed for
       completion of the examination. Students should use their own publications and
       equipment where allowed and needed.
       10.2.1.2. On the examination instruction sheet cover page, identify the examination
       booklet:
          10.2.1.2.1. The first line of this identification gives the examination form number.
          10.2.1.2.2. There will be a minimum of two different version of each examination.
          This procedure produces two possible exams and provides for administering make-up
          examinations when required.
       10.2.1.3. There will be sufficient copies of each version of each examination so each
       student has a copy.
   10.2.2. Aircrew Training Device Missions to include Simulator Refresher:
       10.2.2.1. All aircrew training device lessons will use AF Form 4111 overprints or
       approved 4110 simulator mission profile overprint to ensure students meet the SOI
       required performance levels.
       10.2.2.2. Initial qualification simulator progress assessments will be conducted IAW 11-
       2(MDS) Volume 2 evaluation procedures.
   10.2.3. Computer-Generated Examinations:
44                                                                AFSOCI36-2202 27 JUNE 2009


        10.2.3.1. Sufficient test items must be developed for each examination to allow for a
        minimum of two questions per objective, so there will be sufficient questions for two
        versions of an examination.
        10.2.3.2. Required Screens:
            10.2.3.2.1. The first screen (Log-on screen) for examinations must require the
            student to enter student identification information. Students must be briefed on the
            procedures to be used to log onto the system.
            10.2.3.2.2. The second screen of the examination must identify the examination,
            other items required to complete the examination, type of time limit for the
            examination, instructions for completing the examination, and minimum passing
            score.
10.3. Examination Evaluation Procedures. New examinations or test items will be evaluated
IAW the ISD process and the following:
     10.3.1. Prior to administering the examination to students, administer the examination to
     qualified SMEs who have not participated in its development. This will be considered a
     minimum formative evaluation, prior to administering the examination to students.
     10.3.2. AFSOTC Standardization and Evaluation will analyze test results quarterly for trend
     information to revise tests or curriculum to ensure meeting stated objectives test items
     determined to be invalid will be replaced by new test items.
     10.3.3. AFSOTC Standardization and Evaluation will document results of the test item
     evaluation and forward that information to curriculum flight commander and to Quality
     Assurance Representatives.
10.4. Security of Examinations:
     10.4.1. Written/Printed Examinations:
        10.4.1.1. Ensure the security of examinations during preparation and review.
        10.4.1.2. Ensure that the master copy of each examination is conspicuously marked and a
        separate answer key, with references marked, is available.
        10.4.1.3. Store examinations and keys in a suitable locked cabinet or file. An access list
        of persons who need the examinations to perform their duties will be maintained.
        10.4.1.4. Maintain control logs in each storage drawer.
        10.4.1.5. Inventory examinations semi-annually, or if a compromise is suspected.
        Maintain an inventory sheet for each drawer.
        10.4.1.6. Instructors who administer an examination are responsible for ensuring that
        each booklet is clean and complete after each examination.
     10.4.2. Computer Generated Examinations:
        10.4.2.1. Secure any electronic storage devices (i.e. CDs, USB drives, etc.) that contain
        examinations in the same manner as for written examinations.
        10.4.2.2. Instructors will not allow students to print examination files or specific
        examinations.
AFSOCI36-2202 27 JUNE 2009                                                                 45


   10.4.3. Formal school student tests such as End-of-Module, EOB, and EOP summative
   exams will be maintained and secured in the courseware library. Examinations will not be
   forwarded to units for in-unit upgrade/qualification.
10.5. Scoring. Passing score for examinations is established at 85%:
   10.5.1. Written Examinations. Answer sheets must be scored by the instructor and should
   receive the same security as the examination.
   10.5.2. Computer Generated Examinations. Scoring will be completed by the computer.
   Authoring software will allow for computer record keeping, test item analysis, and feedback
   to the student on areas of weakness.
10.6. Post Examination Critiques. Verbal critiques will be conducted after administering each
written examination. This review or critique should focus attention on the objectives of the
course and should re-emphasize areas of weakness revealed by the examination. Individually
correct all examinations to 100% during the critique.

                                           Chapter 11

 AIRCREW TRAINING QUALITY EVALUATION (GRAD/EVAL) AND CUSTOMER
                      FEEDBACK PROGRAM

11.1. Purpose. The purpose of this paragraph is to define the process and procedures for
collecting, managing, reporting, and maintaining the Aircrew Training Quality Evaluation
Program data. The data obtained through this process will provide management with the tools
necessary to accurately assess, improve, and monitor training courses and respond to student
assessment ratings.
11.2. Scope. This Instruction applies to all personnel involved with aircrew training and
provides a mechanism for gathering and reporting data to assess mission accomplishment and
training course quality. Evaluations are performed on all aspects of aircrew training to ensure
adequate content and ISD effectiveness.
11.3. Responsibilities. The AFSOTC is responsible for all related graduate and customer
evaluations. This paragraph provides specific guidance to ensure training programs use feedback
to assess, revise, and improve training curriculum. IAW established ISD methodology and
curriculum development, training programs use graduate and customer evaluations to ensure
training courses meet established AFSOC and customer requirements. This data provides the
basis for changing and improving the training system. Each student attending an AFSOTC
formal training course is required to complete an EOP evaluation. Copying of student EOP
evaluations should be held to the minimum necessary to complete required actions.
Unsatisfactory items requiring immediate action, such as safety of flight, dangerous tendencies,
etc., will be copied and forwarded to the appropriate agency for immediate action.
11.4. Procedures:
     11.4.1. Internal Evaluations:
        11.4.1.1. The Registrar or Instructor will distribute EOP critiques to all incoming
        students.
        11.4.1.2. Upon completion of each phase of training (including simulator refresher),
        instructors will collect and forward critiques to the Registrar. The Registrar will compile
        and forward original EOP critiques for review.
        11.4.1.3. Results from student phase examinations will be reviewed and entered into the
        Evaluation and Analysis database. The appropriate flight commander will supply the
        data necessary to link test questions to course objectives. This will allow the Evaluation
        and Analysis section to process data to ensure that all course objectives are being tested.
        As tests change, the appropriate flight commander will supply updated information to the
        Evaluation and Analysis section within 10 days from the change.
        11.4.1.4. Results from student flight evaluations will be reviewed and input into the
        Evaluation and Analysis database. The appropriate flight commander will supply the
        data necessary to tie flight evaluation items to course objectives. This enables AFSOTC
        personnel to process data to ensure that all course objectives are being tested. As
        evaluation items change, the appropriate flight commander will supply updated
        information within 10 days from the change.
AFSOCI36-2202 27 JUNE 2009                                                                      47


  11.4.2. External Evaluations:
     11.4.2.1. External evaluations are designed to obtain feedback from field units of
     effectiveness of aircrew related training conducted by the operational units. External
     evaluations are accomplished through:
         11.4.2.1.1. Graduate Evaluation Questionnaires.         One copy of the Training
         Effectiveness Questionnaires will be sent to Mission Qualification graduates and their
         supervisors 180 days following completion of a graduate training course to allow
         graduates and their supervisors sufficient time to evaluate the graduate's skills and
         knowledge to perform the mission. Training unit flight commanders will track
         graduates to ensure appropriate and timely distribution of questionnaires, and monitor
         return rates for questionnaires.
         11.4.2.1.2. Questionnaires will assess stated critical tasks specific to aircraft and (or)
         mission requirements generated from the SOI. Training unit flight commanders will
         provide the critical tasks to be included on the Training Effectiveness Questionnaires.
         Questionnaires will be reviewed annually to ensure validity and updated as required
         to reflect changes in training tasks or mission objectives.
         11.4.2.1.3. A trend analysis will be performed on the data received from these
         questionnaires.     The training unit CC will provide quarterly feedback to
         AFSOTC/CC, HQ AFSOC, and appropriate flight commanders within two weeks
         after the end of each quarter.
         11.4.2.1.4. Training unit flight commanders will analyze questionnaire data and
         develop proposed training modifications to improve graduate quality.
  11.4.3. Training Quality Evaluation Reports. Training unit flight commanders will produce
  these reports with data received from questionnaires, field visits, and internal evaluation
  program analysis. These reports will be published and distributed no later than 3 weeks prior
  to a syllabus review. Reports will contain an analysis of data received during all the previous
  months of training. Include all pertinent comments received on questionnaires, during field
  visits, or from other sources. Reports will highlight potential problem areas, special interest
  items, corrective actions/revisions to training courses, and programmed changes to training
  programs. Distribution of reports will be to the contractor and all customer units, including
  HQ AFSOC/A3T, AFSOTC/OGV, 919 OG/OGV, and 711 SOS/OST.
48                                                           AFSOCI36-2202 27 JUNE 2009

MEMORANDUM FOR 19 SOS/CC

FROM: (Student’s Name)

SUBJECT: Faculty Board

I, (student's name), have read the Faculty Board Notification Letter, and I (have, have not)
discussed my situation with other crewmembers. I request to have the following action take
place.

I, (student's name), wish to self-eliminate from the (name of course). I understand that this
action will disqualify me from future aviation service and could result in my discharge.

I, (student's name), will appear before a Faculty Board and discuss my training problems. I fully
understand that the Faculty Board can either recommend I be eliminated or retained in training. I
also understand that if I am retained in training and receive another (U) grade, I may be
eliminated from training for failure to meet aircrew standards.

                        GUIDE FOR AIRCREW TRAINING RECORD

A8.1. AF Form 4109:
     A8.1.1. Exceptional (E): The student met or exceeded all RPLs and events in an exceptional
     manner.
     A8.1.2. Proficiency Advancement (P):       Awarded in lieu of actual job element
     accomplishment when warranted by student’s previous performance and knowledge. The
     student advances to the next programmed lesson or training period. See Paragraph 4.6. for
     detailed procedures.
     A8.1.3. Satisfactory (S): The student met or exceeded all the listed RPLs for that training
     period. The student advances to the next programmed lesson or training period.
     A8.1.4. Training Record (T): The student fell below a previously attained RPL for one or
     more job elements. The job element was not graded below standard the last time it was
     graded and additional training periods that include that job element remain in that phase. The
     student advances to the next programmed lesson or training period.
     A8.1.5. Unsatisfactory (U): The student fell below a previously attained RPL on the same
     job element for two consecutive training periods, or fell below the listed RPL on any job
     element and no training periods remain prior to an evaluation, or if dangerous tendencies are
     noted.
     A8.1.6. Incomplete (I): The overall grade will be an incomplete under one of the following
     conditions:

Table A8.1. Incomplete Grade Conditions.
     MX:       Maintenance abort or delay.
     OPS:      Operations abort or delay.
     SYM:      Sympathetic abort or delay.
     WX:       Weather abort or delay.
     IN:       Student requirements being incompatible with sortie being flown.
     PHY:      Physiological event.
     OTH:      Reasons other than stated here.
     A8.1.7. Other (X): Flight commanders may authorize additional flights to allow students to
     regain proficiency following extended breaks in training continuity or to allow a student to
     fly on sorties where syllabus job elements will not be performed. These sorties will be
     graded ―X‖. Remedial training will be annotated the same as the deficient academic,
     simulator, or flying lesson followed by an ―R‖ (Example: T4-R-2, etc…). Remedial training
     flights resulting from Q2 or Q3 evaluations will also be annotated with an ―R‖.
     A8.1.8. Mission Time: Enter the total flight time of the training mission in the top half of
     the block and the time that the student actually received instruction (seat time) in the bottom
     half of the block. If more than one mission is completed on a flight, proportion the time to
     each mission.
AFSOCI36-2202 27 JUNE 2009                                                                     71


   A8.1.9. Cumulative Time: Enter total cumulative flight time in the top half of the block and
   total cumulative time instruction time (seat time) in the bottom half of the block.
   A8.1.10. Performance Evaluation Summary: Include only simulator and flying evaluations.
   The training unit DO or designated representative will review and initial the records prior to
   the evaluation.
A8.2. AF Form 4110:
   A8.2.1. Instructors or flight examiners will make comments for all training sessions or
   flights. Generalized comments, such as ―Student made several minor errors on preflight that
   were corrected by the instructor,‖ are not acceptable. Specific errors must be documented.
   A8.2.2. The format for comments are; Profile, Strengths, Weakness, Recommendations.
   A8.2.3. Instructors and instructor candidates will sign below entered comments and print
   their rank and last name below their signature.
   A8.2.4. Students will initial below the comments for each entry to indicate they have read
   and understood the instructor’s remarks.
   A8.2.5. Each scheduled training session involving either a simulator or aircraft that is
   canceled after the student and instructor have arrived, will be documented in the 4110 (no
   entry required in the 4111, unless training was accomplished).
A8.3. AF Form 4111:
   A8.3.1. If the student meets the RPL, slash through the grade.
   A8.3.2. If a higher or lower RPL is met, write that RPL over the pre-printed one.
   A8.3.3. If a mission needs to be re-accomplished (for whatever reason) use a blank column
   to record log the mission events and write in the RPLs.
   A8.3.4. When mission profiles or events have to be re-accomplished, use a blank column to
   log the mission profile events and write in the attained RPL.
A8.4. Remedial Flying:
   A8.4.1. This is additional training given after a student fails a measurement or does not
   attain an RPL. This remedial training will be completed prior to changing phases or
   proceeding in the course.
   A8.4.2. Usually, a maximum of two remedial training flights should be scheduled for any
   specific student deficiency.
   A8.4.3. On the first remedial sortie, if the student performs satisfactory in those previously
   identified deficiencies, the overall grade should be ―S‖ and further remedial sorties are not
   required.
   A8.4.4. If subsequent remedial sorties are required, the grade for the initial sorties would be
   ―X‖, and the final sortie will be graded using normal grading procedures.
   A8.4.5. If any sorties are graded ―U‖, the student will be scheduled for a second level
   progress review.

     A8.4.6. Every effort should be made to have the same instructor for all remedial training
     flights.
