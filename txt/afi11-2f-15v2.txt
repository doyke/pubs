                                           Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1 General. All evaluations will be conducted IAW the provisions of AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew
Standardization/Evaluation Program,and this volume.
1.2. Waivers.
   1.1.1. Unless otherwise specified, AF/A3O-A is the waiver authority for this instruction.
   EXCEPTION: MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority for individual aircrew requirements, but
   may not approve blanket or group (two or more aircrew) waivers.
   1.1.2. Request waivers through applicable Stan/Eval channels to MAJCOM/A3, (or
   equivalent). As applicable, MAJCOM/A3s will forward requests to AF/A3O-A, with an info
   copy to AF/A3O-AT.
   1.1.3. Waiver authority for supplemental guidance will be as specified in the supplement and
   approved through higher level coordination authority.
1.3. Procedures:
   1.3.1. Flight Examiners will use the evaluation criteria contained in Chapter 3 for
   conducting all flight and emergency procedures evaluations. To ensure standard and
   objective evaluations, Flight Examiners will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed
   evaluation criteria.
   1.3.2. Recording devices (Video Tape Recorders (VTR), 8MM, Air Combat Maneuvering
   Instrumentation (ACMI), etc.) should be used, when available, to reconstruct/evaluate the
   mission.
   1.3.3. Unless specified, the examinee or flight examiner may fly in any flight position/seat
   (to include chase) which will best enable the flight examiner to conduct a thorough
   evaluation.
   1.3.4. The flight examiner will brief the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and how
   it will be conducted prior to flight. The examinee will accomplish required flight planning in
   accordance with the flight position during the evaluation. Higher Headquarters (HHQ) flight
   examiners (and unit flight examiners as determined locally) will be furnished a copy of
   necessary mission data, mission materials and data transfer module loads.
   1.3.5. Required areas are shown in Table 2.1 When it is impossible to evaluate a required
   area in flight, it may be evaluated by an alternate method (i.e., in a simulator/aircrew training
   device (ATD)/cockpit procedure trainer (CPT) or by oral examination) in order to complete
   the evaluation. The reason why required area(s) were not evaluated inflight and the alternate
   method of evaluation used will be documented in the Comments portion of the AF Form 8,
   Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
   1.3.6. The flight examiner will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the flight. This debrief will
   include the examinee's overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than
   qualified) and any required additional training.
 4                                                                   AFI11-2F-15V2 14 July 2011


1.4. Grading Instructions. Standards and performance parameters are contained in AFI 11-
202V2 and this instruction.
     1.4.1. The flight examiner will base tolerances for inflight parameters on conditions of
     smooth air and a stable aircraft. Do not consider momentary deviations from tolerances,
     provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not
     jeopardize flying safety. The flight examiner will consider cumulative deviations when
     determining the overall grade.
     1.4.2. When grading criteria specify that airspeed/angle of attack (AOA) be evaluated and
     the flight manual lists only a minimum/maximum/recommended airspeed/AOA for that area,
     the examinee will brief the desired airspeed/AOA.
     1.4.3. The flight examiner will compare examinee performance for each area accomplished
     during the evaluation with the standards provided in this volume and assign an appropriate
     grade for the area. Derive the overall flight evaluation grade from the area grades based on a
     composite for the observed events and tasks IAW this publication.
        1.4.3.1. Flight examiners will use the grading criteria in this volume to determine
        individual area grades. Flight examiner judgment must be exercised when the wording of
        areas is subjective and when specific situations are not covered.
        1.4.3.2. If the examinee receives an unqualified area grade in any of the critical areas
        identified by this volume, an overall unqualified grade will be assigned. Unsatisfactory
        performance in any critical area or critical subarea will result in qualification level of "Q-
        3."
        1.4.3.3. Flight examiner judgment will be the determining factor in arriving at the overall
        grade.
        1.4.3.4. The following general criteria apply during all phases of flight except as noted
        for specific events and instrument final approaches:

Table 1.1. General Criteria.

Q          Altitude                 +/- 200 feet

           Airspeed                 +/- 5%

U                                  Exceeded Q- limits
1.5. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). EPE’s will be conducted in an appropriate
Aircrew Training Device, e.g. Operational Flying Trainers, Weapons and Tactics Trainers, Full
Mission Trainers, etc. If an Aircrew Training Device is not available, the EPE may be given
verbally only as a last resort. If this option is utilized, it will be noted on the AF Form 8 in the
additional comments section. This evaluation will include areas commensurate with examinee's
Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) training level and should highlight current items of interest such
as recently discovered aircraft anomalies or unusual accident investigation results.
    1.5.1. The following items will be included on all emergency procedures evaluations:
       1.5.1.1. Aircraft General Knowledge.
       1.5.1.2. Emergency Procedures.                                           Evaluate a
       minimum of two emergency procedures per phase of flight (i.e., pre-takeoff, takeoff,
       cruise, and landing).
       1.5.1.3. Flight Coordination (if applicable).
       1.5.1.4. Unusual Attitude Recoveries.                                           Required
       on all EPEs. This also fulfills the Area 15 (Unusual Attitude Recoveries) requirement for
       Pilot Instrument/Qualification evaluations.
    1.5.2. The following additional items will be included on EPEs as a requisite for the
    instrument and/or qualification evaluation:
       1.5.2.1. AFMAN      11-217,   Volume 1,   Instrument Flight   Procedures.
       Evaluate a minimum of one Heads-up Display (HUD) out approach and use of
       standby/emergency instruments
       1.5.2.2. Alternate/Divert Airfields.
       Evaluate a minimum of one approach at other than home base.
    1.5.3. Mission evaluation scenarios should be tailored to unit tasking. The following
    additional items should be included on the emergency procedures evaluation given as a
    requisite to the mission evaluation:
       1.5.3.1. Weapons system operation.
       1.5.3.2. Electronic Attack (EA)/Electronic Protect (EP)/All Aspect Missile Defense
       (AAMD)
       1.5.3.3. Weapons employment and switchology.
    1.5.4. Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade will be placed in supervised status
    until recommended additional training is completed and/or a reevaluation is successfully
    accomplished. On qualified with additional training EPEs, the FE will indicate if the
    additional training will be accomplished before the flight evaluation. Additional training and
    reevaluations will be accomplished IAW AFI 11-202V2.
    1.5.5. The following grading criteria will be used to grade individual items on EPEs:
       1.5.5.1. Q. Performance is correct. Quickly recognizes and corrects errors.
 6                                                                 AFI11-2F-15V2 14 July 2011


        1.5.5.2. Q-. Performance is safe, but indicates limited proficiency. Makes errors of
        omission or commission.
        1.5.5.3. U. Performance is unsafe or indicates lack of knowledge or ability.
1.6. Documentation of Weapons Employment Results. Weapons employment results will be
documented in the Mission Description Section of the AF Form 8 for mission evaluations.
Include entries for each type of simulated ordnance that was employed.
     1.6.1. Air-to-Air. Record the number of simulated missile/gunfiring attempts and the
     number that were valid as in Table 1.2

Table 1.2. Weapons Employment Scores.

8MM assessed

Include entries for each type of simulated ordnance that was employed.

1.6.2. Flight Examiner Judgment.
Flight examiner judgment will be the determining factor in deciding the weapons employment
grade. If the examinee fails to qualify in any event(s), the flight examiner may elect to award a
higher area grade than warranted by the score(s). The flight examiner will include justification
for such an award in the Comments Section of the AF Form 8.
AFI11-2F-15V2 14 July 2011                                                                       7

                             EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General:
   2.1.1. All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-202V2. The procedures and
   flight profiles outlined in this chapter apply to all F-15 units. Evaluation requirements are
   depicted in Table 2.1
   2.1.2. Areas indicated with an "R" are required items for that evaluation. A required area is a
   specific area that must be evaluated to complete the evaluation. All required areas must be
   included in the flight evaluation profile. However, if it is impossible to accomplish a required
   area inflight, the flight examiner may elect to evaluate the area(s) by an alternate method
   (i.e., simulator, OFT, FMT, WTT, CPT, ATD verbally, etc.), in order to complete the
   evaluation. If the flight examiner determines the required item cannot be adequately
   evaluated by an alternate method, the examinee will require an additional flight to complete
   the evaluation.
   2.1.3. Publications Check:
       2.1.3.1. T.O. 1F-15X-1CL-1
       2.1.3.2. T.O. 1F-15X-34-1-3CL-1
       2.1.3.3. Local In-flight Guide
       2.1.3.4. Any additional publications issued to aircrews and specified in the unit
       addendum to AFI 11-202V2.
   2.1.4. With the approval of the Operations Group Commander, the INSTM/QUAL
   evaluation and the MSN evaluation may be combined as a single evaluation. Unit
   Commanders, with coordination through the unit Chief of Stan/Eval, may designate
   experienced pilots for this combined evaluation option. Evaluations flown in this manner
   must fulfill all current INSTM/QUAL and MSN evaluation requirements, including ground
   phase requisites. For combined MSN/INSTM/QUAL evaluations, one EPE may be
   accomplished that encompasses requirements of both EPEs. Additional simulator time may
   be required to complete these items.
2.2. Pilot Instrument/Qualification Evaluation. A mission flown according to instrument
flight rules (to the maximum extent practical) best fulfills the objective of the
instrument/qualification evaluation. To the maximum extent possible, this evaluation will include
approaches at airfields other than home or deployed locations (USAFE: Preferably non-US
locations). This evaluation may be administered on any compatible training mission with the
approval of the unit Chief of Stan/Eval with Commander's concurrence. When B/D aircraft are
available, pilots may complete their Inst/Qual evaluation in a dual cockpit aircraft with a flight
examiner occupying the rear cockpit. Minimum ground phase requisites are:
   2.2.1. Requisite Instrument Examination IAW with AFMAN 11-210
   2.2.2. EPE
 8                                                                  AFI11-2F-15V2 14 July 2011


2.3. Mission Evaluation. Scenarios that represent unit Designed Operational Capability (DOC)
tasking satisfy the requirements of this evaluation. The profiles will be designed to evaluate the
training/flight position/special qualifications as well as basic airmanship of the examinee. Initial
mission evaluations will be given in the primary DOC of the unit. Mission evaluations will
normally be flown using unit formations and tactics. Examinees will be evaluated in the position
of their highest qualification. If briefed, at the flight examiners discretion, portions may be flown
in another position, but the emphasis is to have examinees evaluated at their highest qualification
level. Based on the examinee's experience level, a wingman may be required to brief (to include
tactics) and/or lead certain phases of the mission, but will not be evaluated using flight lead
grading criteria. Evaluations during exercises or deployments are encouraged.
Note: Basic Mission Capable (BMC) pilots will only be evaluated on those missions routinely
performed. Examinees will only be evaluated on those areas for which they are qualified.
     2.3.1. Minimum ground phase requisites are:
        2.3.1.1. EPE.
        2.3.1.2. Air Defense certified pilots in wings which support a full-time Air Sovereignty
        Alert (ASA) detachment (or home-station alert) will complete at least one Air
        Sovereignty intercept during every Mission EPE.
     2.3.2. Air-to-Air. This evaluation will include, as a minimum, one intercept, offensive
     maneuvering and planned weapons employment. When practical, adversaries should simulate
     enemy aircraft, tactics and ordnance. Dissimilar aircraft are preferred. Additionally, pilots:
        2.3.2.1. Must have the ability to employ beyond visual range (BVR) air-to-air weapons.
        2.3.2.2. Will normally perform one Air Sovereignty Tasking (if applicable to unit DOC
        statement tasking).
        2.3.2.3. When weather or other restrictions prohibit D/ACBT, or LOWAT, they may fly
        multiple intercepts.
2.4. Formal Course Evaluation. Syllabus evaluations will be flown IAW syllabus mission
profile guidelines if stated, or on a mission profile developed from syllabus training objectives.
Formal course guidelines may be modified, based on local operating considerations or flight
examiner judgment, to complete the evaluation. Training objectives and related areas will be
graded using the performance criteria in Chapter 3.
2.5. Instructor Evaluation. Instructor evaluations will be conducted IAW AFI 11-202V2.
Flight evaluations will include a thorough evaluation of the examinee's instructor knowledge and
ability. This is a one-time check in which the examinee must demonstrate ability to instruct in
some phase of the unit's mission. Except for requirements delineated in Table 2.1, specific
profiles and/or events will be determined by the Flight Examiner. Subsequent evaluations (for
example, Instrument/Qualification, Mission) will include instructor portions during the
evaluations.
     2.5.1. For units whose instructor pilots (IP) normally instruct from a chase aircraft, the
     examinee should fly a portion of the mission in the chase position, if feasible.
     2.5.2. FTU Instructor Pilot. FTU Instructor Pilot mission evaluation profiles will normally
     be IAW the formal course syllabus for any mission which the IP is qualified to instruct.

2.6. FTU Instructor Pilot Rear Cockpit Evaluations. When FTU IPs are required to perform
rear cockpit instructor duties, an evaluation of rear cockpit landings will be completed prior to
performing rear cockpit landing instructor duties. These duties include instruction for and
demonstration of landings during initial qualification training, requalification training, or
additional training. Not required for operational unit rear cockpit qualified IPs.
    2.6.1. Examinees will complete the evaluation as follows:
       2.6.1.1. All rear cockpit landing qualification evaluations will include satisfactory
       demonstration of: overhead, straight-in and emergency pattern approaches and landings
       performed from the rear cockpit.
       2.6.1.2. FTU IPs will accomplish the rear cockpit landing qualification during either the
       combined instrument/qualification sortie, the mission evaluation sortie or during another
       sortie as a requisite. Each unit will specify when the rear cockpit landing qualification
       will be completed and identify procedures for completion of this requirement in the unit
       supplement to AFI 11-202V2.
    2.6.2. When the rear cockpit landing qualification is evaluated during a separate sortie as a
    requisite for a flight evaluation, record "SPOT" in the Flight Phase block on the AF Form 8.
    Describe the purpose of the evaluation as “Rear Cockpit Landing Qualification” in the
    Mission Description section of the Comments block. In addition, flight Examiners will
    document all discrepancies on the AF Form 8 in Section IV, paragraph b, under a
    subparagraph after the Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE) discrepancies as follows: "2.
    Rear Cockpit Landing Qualification." If no discrepancies are identified, enter "None" after
    the subparagraph title. A subparagraph 3 would then be used for flight discrepancies. If a
    reevaluation is required, an additional "SPOT" entry will be recorded in the Flight Phase
    block on the front of the AF Form 8. Additional training will be documented IAW AFI 11-
    202V2.
    2.6.3. An initial rear cockpit landing qualification may be conducted independently of
    another evaluation. Flight Examiners will document completion of this Rear Cockpit Landing
    Qualification as a “SPOT” on an AF Form 8. Align the expiration date with the expiration
    date of the current evaluation during which the examinee would normally complete this
    requirement.

Notes:
1. Airwork/Advanced Handling/Tactical Maneuvering. Units will determine appropriate
proficiency maneuvers for pilot experience levels. Examples are, but are not limited to:
a. Basic Fighter Maneuvers (BFM)
b. Advanced handling characteristics
c. Formation (fingertip, tactical, trail)
2. Unusual Attitude Recoveries. Do not perform unusual attitude recoveries in single-seat
aircraft. They will be evaluated during EPE’s or if evaluated in dual-seat aircraft in-flight, will
be performed with a flight examiner in the aircraft.
3. It may be impractical to evaluate these required items on certain FTU Instructor evaluations
due to student syllabus constraints (e.g. BFM mission checks). Squadron commanders may
approve these exceptions to validate instructor effectiveness. Document in the Additional
Comments portion of the AF Form 8.
4. ASA Units. ASA wings are waived and authorized to evaluate Air-to-Air Weapons
Employment (Area 77) and Air Sovereignty Tasking (Area 72) during EPE profiles.

           3.4.2.2.3. U. Failed to complete intercepts/visual identification passes because of
           improper procedures. Did not complete an armament/safety check. Failed to perform
           proper procedures for air defense operations.
       3.4.2.3. Area 73--Tactical Intercept/Patrol:
           3.4.2.3.1. Q. Thorough knowledge and correct employment of tactical intercept
           procedures. Intercept resulted in a successful VID/EID followed by an offensive
           attack, if applicable. CAP successfully employed and designated airspace patrolled in
           a satisfactory manner.
34                                                             AFI11-2F-15V2 14 July 2011


        3.4.2.3.2. Q-. Limited knowledge of tactical intercept procedures. Intercept resulted
        in a successful VID/EID; however, large or difficult corrections were required to
        complete the pass and subsequent attack. CAP could have been more effective.
        3.4.2.3.3. U. Intercept unsuccessful due to poor techniques and/or improper
        procedures. Intercept terminated in a counteroffensive position. Designated CAP
        airspace not patrolled effectively or attacks not negated.
     3.4.2.4. Area 74. Not used.
     3.4.2.5. Area 75--Offensive Maneuvering:
        3.4.2.5.1. Q. Effective use of basic fighter maneuvering and air combat maneuvering
        to attack/counter opposing aircraft. Good aircraft control. Effectively managed energy
        level during engagements.
        3.4.2.5.2. Q-. Limited maneuvering proficiency; however, during engagements did
        not effectively counter opposing aircraft. Occasionally mismanaged energy levels,
        jeopardizing offensive advantage.
        3.4.2.5.3. U. Unsatisfactory knowledge or performance of maneuvers, aircraft
        handling or energy management. Lost offensive advantage.
     3.4.2.6. Area 76--Defensive/Counteroffensive Maneuvering:
        3.4.2.6.1. Q. Performed correct initial move to counter attack of opposing aircraft.
        Used correct maneuvers to negate the threat.
        3.4.2.6.2. Q-. Some hesitation or confusion during initial stages of
        counteroffensive/defensive situation. Minor errors in energy management or BFM
        delayed negating the attack of an opposing aircraft.
        3.4.2.6.3. U. Unable to negate attack of opposing aircraft.
     3.4.2.7. Area 77--Air-to-Air Weapons Employment. Snapshots assessed as misses
     may be discounted from computations if attacks were tactically sound and attempted
     within designated parameters.
        3.4.2.7.1. Q. Demonstrated proper knowledge of missile/gun firing procedures and
        attack parameters. Simulated missile/gun-firing were accomplished at each
        opportunity and within designated parameters. Successfully completed 75 percent (or
        two of three/one of two) of attempted shots.
        3.4.2.7.2. Q-. Demonstrated limited knowledge of missile/gun firing procedures and
        attack parameters. Simulated employment of weapons was successful but made minor
        errors which did not affect overall result. Slow to recognize appropriate parameters.
        Successfully completed 50 percent or more of all attempted shots (four or more
        attempts).
        3.4.2.7.3. U. Demonstrated inadequate knowledge of missile/gun firing procedures
        or attack parameters. Attempts to simulate weapons employment were unsuccessful
        due to aircrew error. Did not meet Q- criteria.
