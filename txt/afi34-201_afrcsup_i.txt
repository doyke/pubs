(NAF) and nonappropriated fund instrumentalities (NAFI) under the responsibility of the Air Force
Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Advisory Board (AFMWRAB).
The Board of Directors, Army and Air Force Civilian Welfare Fund (AAFCWF), has approved the use of
this instruction by base restaurant funds (BRFs) and base civilian welfare funds (BCWFs), provided guid-
ance does not conflict with AFJI 34-122, Civilian Nonappropriated Funds (NAFs) and Morale, Welfare,
and Recreation (MWR) Activities. In cases of conflict, AFJI 34-122 takes precedence.
Major commands (MAJCOM) may supplement this instruction with advance approval of the Com-
mander, Air Force Services Agency. Send two copies of each proposed MAJCOM supplement to the
Directorate of Financial Management and Comptroller, Headquarters Air Force Services Agency (HQ
AFSVA/SVF), 10100 Reunion Place, Suite 400, San Antonio TX 78216-4138. Send copies of each pub-
lished MAJCOM supplement to the Director of Services, Headquarters United States Air Force (HQ
USAF), 1770 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1770, and to HQ AFSVA/SVFA. Forward one

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision incorporates Interim Change IC 2002-1. This change expands the Special Morale and Wel-
fare (SM&W) expenditure authority to provide mementos to the spouses of awardees, promoted individ-
uals, and retirees, and mementos for guests of honor at memorialization (naming a street, building, etc.)
functions. The entire text of the IC is at the last attachment.
(AFRC) This supplement is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision
implements AFRC Form 211, Request for Special Morale and Welfare (SM&W) Funds. SM&W funds
may be used to provide light refreshments at a reception when installation commanders host base-wide
promotion ceremonies. Appropriated funds (APFs) are authorized to be used for the purchase of an appro-
priate wreath in solemn remembrance or celebration of national patriotic observances, and SM&W funds
will not be used for the Outstanding Airmen of the Year (OAY) Program.

                                     GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Nonappropriated Funds (NAFs). NAFs are Government funds but are separate and apart from
funds that are recorded in the books of the US Treasury. They are not appropriated by the Congress.
NAFs come primarily from the sale of goods and services to Department of Defense (DoD) military and
civilian personnel and their families.

1.2. Purpose of Air Force NAFs. Use NAFs for the collective benefit of military personnel, their fami-
lies, and authorized civilians. These funds support morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR) programs,
lodging, certain religious and educational programs, and other programs authorized in this instruction.

1.3. Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentality (NAFI). A NAFI is an integral DoD fiscal and organiza-
tional entity that performs an essential Government function. It acts in its own name to provide, or to help
other DoD organizations provide MWR and related programs and services. The heads of the service
departments establish and operate NAFIs individually or jointly.

1.4. Legal Status of Air Force NAFIs. An Air Force NAFI is an integral part of the Air Force. A NAFI
is entitled to all sovereign privileges and immunities of the United States as provided in the Constitution
and the statutes, under international law, in treaties, and in executive agreements. A NAFI is not incorpo-
rated under the laws of any state of the United States, District of Columbia, or foreign equivalent. It
enjoys the legal status of an instrumentality of the United States.

1.5. NAFIs and Other Activities Not Controlled by This Instruction. These NAFIs exist on bases but
are not subject to this instruction:
   1.5.1. Joint Army and Air Force NAFIs. Responsibility for joint Army and Air Force NAFIs is
   vested in:
       1.5.1.1. The Board of Directors, Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES), for AAFES.
       See the AFJI 34-series regulations for policy, organization, and administration of this NAFI.
       1.5.1.2. The Board of Directors, Army and Air Force Civilian Welfare Fund (AAFCWF), for base
       civilian welfare and base restaurant NAFIs. By joint Army and Air Force agreement specified in
       Army and Air Force Adjustment regulation No. 1-30-1, the Secretaries of the Air Force and Army
       have vested responsibility for the AAFCWF with the Board of Directors, AAFCWF. The Board
       oversees policy for base restaurant funds, base civilian welfare funds, and the AACFWF.
   1.5.2. Stars and Stripes NAFIs. The European and Pacific Stars and Stripes funds furnish informa-
   tion and news services to persons serving in their areas of operation. Stars and Stripes funds are man-
   aged as prescribed in Unified Commands (USEUCOM), Headquarters US Army Europe
   (USAREUR) and Pacific Command (PACOM) command directives.
   1.5.3. Private Organizations. See AFI 34-123, Private Organizations Program.

1.6. NAFI Records. All records that NAFIs create and receive are official Air Force records. See the
AFI 37-series instructions for their creation, use, maintenance, release, and disposition.

1.7. NAF Contracts. See AFI 64-301, NAF Contracting, and AFMAN 64-302, NAF Contracting, for
specific NAF contracting procedures.

1.8. Delegations. For purposes of this instruction, don't delegate the authorities and responsibilities
assigned to specific positions unless otherwise provided.

       2.6.4.3. Council recommendations take effect as soon as the installation commander approves
       them.
       2.6.4.4. Council actions that occur out of session, including telephone votes and staffing actions,
       are not effective until approved by the appropriate authority (MAJCOM/CC, installation com-
       mander, or designee).
       2.6.4.5. Voting members cannot be employed by any NAFI with which the council is officially
       involved.

2.7. Advisory Committees. Advisory committees, such as those for clubs or golf, act as program advi-
sors to operational managers. Their duties, procedures, composition, and specific responsibilities are
defined in other AFI 34-series instructions.
   2.7.1. Public Law 92-463, Federal Advisory Committee Act, requires Government advisory commit-
   tees and councils which include persons who are not officers or Federal employees, to comply with
14                                                    AFI34-201_AFRCSUP_I 15 NOVEMBER 2007


     requirements that are impractical for Air Force Services and related advisory committees. However,
     such committees and councils may include military family members and military retirees and family
     members and still remain exempt from the Act's administrative requirements. Limit advisory com-
     mittee membership to Federal Governmental personnel and members of military families, and mili-
     tary retirees and their family members.

Section 2D—Auditing and Inspecting NAFIs.

2.8. Cooperating with Audits and Inspections.
     2.8.1. NAFIs at all levels of command are subject to audit as outlined in AFPD 65-3, Internal Audit-
     ing, and to normal inspection by commanders, inspectors, and other representatives of commanders.
     The Air Force Audit Agency and contracted civilian CPA firms periodically review and audit NAFIs
     according to AFI 65-301, Audit Reporting Procedures, and AFI 65-403, Follow up on Internal US Air
     Force Audit Reports, to make sure that each of the functions meets current needs in a manner consis-
     tent with sound business practices. These audits meet the standards required by Government Auditing
     Standards issued by the United States GAO.
        2.8.1.1. NAFI custodians cooperate as requested with representatives of:
            2.8.1.1.1. The Air Force Audit Agency (AFAA).
            2.8.1.1.2. Office of Special Investigation (OSI).
            2.8.1.1.3. Inspector General.
            2.8.1.1.4. Air Force-contracted public accounting firms.
            2.8.1.1.5. The General Accounting Office.
        2.8.1.2. The appropriate commander refers suspected mishandling of NAFs and NAFI property
        and violations of standards of conduct to the OSI for investigation. Commanders also ensure com-
        pliance with AFI 34-202, Protection of Assets, for losses of NAFI assets.
        2.8.1.3. Commanders notify the appropriate AFAA Area Audit office chief when NAFIs are acti-
        vated or inactivated.

2.9. Enforcing Quality Control. HQ AFSVA/SVQE, Evaluations Division, asks the Services squadron
commander or director through the MAJCOM to appoint a quality assurance evaluator (QAE) from the
RMF for a base subject to a Public Accountant Contract Audit (PACA). After notification of the appoint-
ment, HQ AFSVA/SVQE provides the QAE with an instructional package. The QAE coordinates the
PACA based on the information package.
     2.9.1. The FM is the audit focal point. The FM assists the QAE and activity managers during audits
     and report preparation.

                                                 Chapter 3

                            ESTABLISHING AND DISSOLVING NAFIS

Section 3A—Establishing NAFIs

3.1. Basic Procedures. The CSAF, under the authority of the SAF:
- Establishes or dissolves Air Force NAFIs that are under the purview of the AFMWRAB.
- Determines the official designations and categories of these and other Air Force NAFIs in accordance
with Congressional and DoD guidance.
- Administers Air Force-level NAFIs. Certain Air Force-level NAFIs are successor NAFIs (see para-
graph 3.3.) for other NAFIs.
   3.1.1. A command-level MWR fund exists at:
   - Each MAJCOM.
   - Each field operating agency (FOA) headquarters that has jurisdiction and host responsibility over
   one or more bases.
   - HQ AFSVA.
       3.1.1.1. MAJCOMs and FOAs establish an MWR fund NAFI at each Air Force base within the
       command.
   3.1.2. HQ USAF/SV approves the establishment of MAJCOM NAFIs and installation NAFIs that
   aren't specifically listed in Chapter 3, Section 3B.
   3.1.3. NAFIs below HQ USAF level created after 1 Oct 1988 must have a charter ( Attachment 3)
   signed by the official who authorized the NAFI, for example, the MAJCOM commander. This
   authority is called the chartering authority.
       3.1.3.1. In the chartering authority letter, include:
           3.1.3.1.1. The proposed purpose of the NAFI.
           3.1.3.1.2. A clear justification of how the NAFI was necessary to meet Air Force program
           objectives.
           3.1.3.1.3. Types of functional activities the NAFI will conduct.
           3.1.3.1.4. Successor NAFI ( paragraph 3.3.).
           3.1.3.1.5. A financial plan to operate the supported activities.
NOTE: NAFIs established before or initially established as a result of implementation of the installation
MWR fund concept or Air Force reorganization/restructure is not affected by this paragraph's require-
ment, but disestablishment is according to this instruction.
   3.1.4. Each NAFI's official title must be standard. Prefix NAFI titles by the applicable command,
   base, or isolated unit's official name; for example, Air Combat Command MWR Fund and Randolph
   Air Force Base MWR Fund.

3.2. Categorizing NAFIs and Activities. (See AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Wel-
fare, and Recreation Programs and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities, for categories of NAFIs and
activities.) Categorize NAFIs and activities to:
     3.2.1. Ensure uniformity and standardization.
     3.2.2. Promote an understanding of the relationships of NAFIs to the activities they support.
     3.2.3. Identify how much appropriated fund (APF) support may be authorized for MWR activities
     within each category.

3.3. Successor NAFIs. Establish NAFIs through the successive delegation of authority through com-
mand channels. Each NAFI has a successor NAFI at either base, MAJCOM, or HQ USAF level. They
ensure responsive, responsible and solvent NAFI financial administration.
     3.3.1. A successor NAFI:
        3.3.1.1. Provides the initial assets to establish a new subordinate NAFI. Identifies the successor
        NAFI in each new NAFI's charter.
        3.3.1.2. Acts on requests from its subordinate organizations for support or assistance.
        3.3.1.3. Receives or directs the disposition of residual assets of dissolved NAFIs for which it is
        the successor NAFI.
        3.3.1.4. Ensures all debts of the dissolved NAFI are settled.
        3.3.1.5. Notifies the successor NAFI custodian immediately when it intends to dissolve a NAFI.
        The custodian of the dissolving NAFI ensures that no one wastes NAFI's assets.
        3.3.1.6. Receives or redistributes excess assets as authorized for the type of NAFI involved.
     3.3.2. Names and relationships of successor NAFIs are as follows:
        3.3.2.1. The Air Force Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Fund (AFMWRF) is the successor NAFI
        for all the HQ USAF NAFIs, MAJCOM MWR funds, Air Force portion of AAFES, and any other
        funds that the CSAF specifies.
        3.3.2.2. The Air Force Lodging Fund (AFLF) is the successor NAFI for MAJCOM lodging funds.
        The AFLF pays severance at closing bases when there aren't enough funds in residual assets or the
        MAJCOM lodging fund is insolvent. The MAJCOM lodging fund acts as successor for base lodg-
        ing funds within the command.
        3.3.2.3. The MAJCOM MWR fund is the successor NAFI for the MAJCOM's base MWR funds
        and any other base NAFIs under the purview of the AFMWRAB, except for lodging funds, civil-
        ian welfare funds, and base restaurants. The MAJCOM MWR fund is also the successor NAFI for
        Stars and Stripes (where applicable) and isolated unit MWR funds. EXCEPTION: If the isolated
        unit fund is funded by a base MWR fund, the base MWR fund is the successor NAFI.
     3.3.3. Specify any deviation from successor relationships identified in this instruction in the charter
     and get prior approval from Chairman, Finance and Audit Committee, AFMWRAB.
AFI34-201_AFRCSUP_I 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                  17


Section 3B—Types of NAFIs.

3.4. Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) NAFs. APFs, NAFs, and a combination of APFs and
NAFs fund MWR programs and facilities, depending on their nature.
   3.4.1. The custodian determines whether MWR or other authorized programs proposed for NAF
   funding fit the criteria for support stated in this instruction. Sources of funds include:
      3.4.1.1. Air Force AAFES dividends paid monthly to installation and MAJCOM MWR funds.
      Distribution to bases is a percentage of local AAFES exchange sales. MAJCOMs receive an
      amount equal to a percentage of what their bases receive. HQ USAF/SV establishes the percent-
      age amounts. Chapter 11 covers locations where no AAFES exchange facilities exist.
      3.4.1.2. Local fees and charges, membership dues, and proceeds from the sale of merchandise and
      services from MWR activities. This income remains at the generating base to support MWR pro-
      grams and activities.
      3.4.1.3. Contributions and donations.
      3.4.1.4. Income from other sources, including concessionaire-operated activities.

3.5. Command, Base, and Unit-level MWR NAFIs.
   3.5.1. Command-level MWR Funds. Establish command-level MWR funds according to paragraph
   3.1. and establish councils according to paragraph 2.6.3.
      3.5.1.1. Income includes:
          3.5.1.1.1. Residual assets of dissolved or inactivated subordinate MWR NAFIs.
          3.5.1.1.2. Distributions from other MAJCOM-level NAFIs and the AFMWRF.
          3.5.1.1.3. Other contributions and donations accepted as authorized.
      3.5.1.2. Expenditures include:
          3.5.1.2.1. Redistribution of assets as authorized in this instruction.
          3.5.1.2.2. Unpaid bills of dissolved subordinate NAFIs.
          3.5.1.2.3. Costs for authorized programs and activities of, and services required by, the NAFI.
   3.5.2. Installation MWR Funds (MWRF). The installation MWRF NAFI receives, administers,
   and disburses funds to help finance MWR activities and programs at base-level when they aren't sup-
   ported by another installation NAFI. See authorized expenditures in Chapter 4. Income comes from:
      3.5.2.1. Distributions from higher headquarters NAFIs.
      3.5.2.2. Incidental income, such as participation fees and charges and proceeds from the sale of
      merchandise and services (see paragraph 4.4.).
      3.5.2.3. Other sources, including concessionaire-operated activities.
      3.5.2.4. Slot machine proceeds (overseas).
      3.5.2.5. Contributions and donations (see Chapter 5).
      3.5.2.6. Residual assets of dissolved or inactivated subordinate unit MWR funds.
18                                                    AFI34-201_AFRCSUP_I 15 NOVEMBER 2007


        3.5.2.7. Membership dues.
        3.5.2.8. Direct AAFES dividends.
     3.5.3. New Programs. AFI 34-209 describes the NAF cost center code (CCC) to use in reporting
     NAF income and expenses associated with authorized MWR programs and services.
        3.5.3.1. If a proposed program is not covered by an existing CCC, submit a brief description of
        the program through the MAJCOM and HQ AFSVA/SVF to HQ USAF/SV for review.
        3.5.3.2. HQ USAF/SV assigns the proper APF support category and CCC, evaluates its impact on
        insurance coverage and premiums, and provides additional guidance on how to conduct the new
        program.
     3.5.4. Isolated Unit Funds (IUF). Unit-level MWR funds are authorized for active Air Force and
     AFRES units that are designated as isolated. The Air Force MWR or AFRES MWR Fund provides
     support to Air National Guard (ANG) units. Income and expenditures are the same as for installation
     MWR funds. (See Chapter 11.)

3.6. Command Lodging Funds. Each MAJCOM has a command lodging fund. It allows the use of
command-wide resources for needed base lodging improvements (see AFI 34-601, Air Force Lodging
Program).
     3.6.1. Don't invest base-level lodging funds. The command lodging fund has the only savings
     account for lodging funds in the command. It receives all interest earned, including that on the CMIP
     demand deposits.
     3.6.2. Each base-level lodging fund maintains CMIP deposits to cover normal operating expenses. If
     the MAJCOM determines it necessary, it may move excess funds to the command lodging fund to
     fund capital expenditures or provide operating capital for needy bases. Grants are the normal source
     of funds for capital expenditures or for operating capital at needy bases.

3.7. Base Lodging NAFIs. Each base establishes a lodging NAFI with the approval of the MAJCOM.
     3.7.1. Activities within a base lodging NAFI operate on a self-sustaining basis as indicated by the
     lodging fund profit and loss statement. This operation focuses on achieving the financial indicators
     established by HQ USAF/SV for the lodging NAFI. Set daily service charge rates according to AFI
     34-601.
     3.7.2. Small lodging activities (maximum of 15 rooms) may be satellites of another base's lodging
     NAFI when approved by HQ AFSVA/CC. Small lodging activities established before 1 Feb 1991 cur-
     rently being operated under an MWR fund are "grandfathered."
     3.7.3. Transfer lodging funds (through the command lodging fund) from one base lodging fund to
     another within the command to help needy bases and improve lodging services.
     3.7.4. Establish temporary lodging facility (TLF) charges to provide enough cash to pay the assess-
     ment, cover operating expenses, and provide for capital requirements or improvements. Do not gen-
     erate any extra cash.

3.8. Air Force Fisher Houses (Special NAFIs). Fisher Houses provide temporary lodging for families
of patients who are hospitalized for complicated or critical medical problems.
AFI34-201_AFRCSUP_I 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                   19


   3.8.1. NAFs provide support to Fisher Houses through supplemental mission support NAFIs that
   operate as TLFs. Treat them as you would TLFs and lodging funds. The base lodging fund is the suc-
   cessor NAFI for Fisher Houses. Services supports the operation by providing accounting and contract-
   ing services .
       3.8.1.1. User fees, donations and gifts (with appropriate approvals), and APFs support Fisher
       Houses, as authorized. Services supports the operation by providing both accounting and con-
       tracting services through the NAF AO.
   3.8.2. The installation commander administers the NAFI. Overall responsibility for operations rests
   with Medical Treatment Facility commander.
   3.8.3. The Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) commander initiates the request for the special NAFI
   charter. Overall responsibility for the operation rests with the MTF commander. The MTF com-
   mander is a voting member of the base NAFs Council at locations with Fisher Houses.

3.9. Commandants' School Mission Support Funds (CSMSFs). CSMSFs provide services for stu-
dents and faculty of Air Force schools and aid in military career education and training. Use these NAFs
to directly contribute to the schools' missions.
   3.9.1. "Commandant" is the head of an Air Force school, commander of a training center or base, or
   Superintendent, USAFA. MAJCOMs identify the commandants.
   3.9.2. MAJCOM/CC approves the establishment or dissolution of such NAFIs at base level.
   3.9.3. Identify CSMSFs by the official school and base designation; for example, Commandant's
   School Mission Support Fund, USAF School of Aerospace Medicine, Air Force Materiel Command,
   Brooks AFB TX 78235-5000.
   3.9.4. Authorized expenses in support of the school's mission are:
       3.9.4.1. Cost-conscious development or improvement of training and educational materials.
       3.9.4.2. Payments to civilian and retired military speakers and lecturers participating in official
       school functions and contributing to the curriculum.
       3.9.4.3. Minimal incidental expenses for distinguished speakers and guests designated by the
       commandant. Keep expenditures conservative and limit expenditures to the same kinds of pur-
       chases authorized from special morale and welfare funds (SM&W) (see Chapter 12).
       3.9.4.4. Awards for instructor and student incentive programs associated with the school's mis-
       sion.
   3.9.5. The MAJCOM MWRF is the successor NAFI for command CSMSFs.

3.10. United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Athletic Association and Cadet Dining Hall
Funds. The Superintendent, USAFA, directly controls, operates, and supervises these NAFIs. They are
not part of the Air Force MWR Program for purposes of APF reporting and other limitations.

3.11. HQ USAF Special Fund (Pentagon). This NAFI receives income from the DoD Concession
Committee. Its income supports the SAF and HQ USAF Welfare and Recreation Activities.

Section 3C—Dissolving NAFIs

3.12. Basic Procedures.
     3.12.1. The appropriate major commander may dissolve a NAFI when:
        3.12.1.1. The commander concerned recommends dissolution.
        3.12.1.2. The NAFI becomes insolvent.
        3.12.1.3. The NAFI is no longer needed.
        3.12.1.4. Dissolution is in the best interest of the Air Force.
        3.12.1.5. The CSAF determines it appropriate for NAFIs under the jurisdiction of the AFM-
        WRAB.
NOTE: For civilian welfare and base restaurant NAFIs, see AFJI 34-122.
     3.12.2. Notify the custodian of the successor NAFI and HQ USAF/SV or AAFCWF, as appropriate,
     of intent to dissolve a NAFI.
        3.12.2.1. The custodian of the dissolving NAFI advises the successor NAFI custodian what assets
        are available for redistribution.
        3.12.2.2. On dissolution, successor NAFIs receive residual assets of the dissolved NAFI and must
        pay any remaining debts after liquidating assets.
        3.12.2.3. Prepare a report to the custodian of the Air Force-level successor fund when a NAFI is
        reconstituted, reorganized, retitled, or moved to another organizational jurisdiction. Recharter the
        NAFI if needed. See Attachment 4 for a NAFI dissolution checklist.
     3.12.3. Successor NAFI custodians provide accounting procedures for the dissolution of NAFIs.

3.13. Disposing of NAF Property Upon Base Closure.
     3.13.1. Dispose of furnishings, fixtures, and equipment purchased with NAFs in accordance with this
     instruction and AFI 34-204. AFJI 34-122 explains how to dispose of NAF assets purchased by civil-
     ian NAFIs.
     3.13.2. To dispose of NAF property on base closure:
     - Assure maximum reutilization of NAF property within the Air Force and DoD when economical and
     feasible.
     - Take action to prevent destroying the integrity of real property at a base being deactivated or closed.
     Don't sell NAF property for token value or donate it to the civilian community, except where specifi-
     cally approved by HQ USAF/SV.
        3.13.2.1. The CSAF or the Board of Directors, AAFCWF, as appropriate, is the final Air Force
        authority for the disposition of NAF property under the jurisdiction of that Board.
        3.13.2.2. No one may dispose of NAF-owned property except as provided in this instruction and
        in AFI 34-204 or AFJI 34-122.
AFI34-201_AFRCSUP_I 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                 21


       3.13.2.3. Air Force NAFIs are entitled to recoup the fair market value or a reasonable percentage
       of the value of NAF-owned property sold to the local community. See paragraph 6.6.2. for guid-
       ance on selling a building or structure acquired or constructed with NAFs.
       3.13.2.4. The NAFI custodian notifies the successor NAFI custodian, and if necessary HQ
       AFSVA/SVF or AAFCWF for assistance, when local officials fail to respond to negotiations in a
       timely manner.
       3.13.2.5. Use the checklist for NAFI dissolution ( Attachment 4).

3.14. Controlling Expenses Before Dissolving a NAFI. Before dissolving a NAFI, the commander
ensures there are no extravagant expenditures or unnecessary dissipation of assets (see Attachment 4).

                                                 Chapter 4

                             WHAT NAFS COVER AND DON'T COVER

4.1. Basic Criteria for Using NAFs. NAFs provide goods, services, facilities, equipment, and man-
power for MWR programs and activities. Use NAFs for other purposes only as permitted in this and other
AFIs. Do not use NAFs for any purpose unless such use is allowed in the general authorization above or
elsewhere in this or other AFIs. The absence of a prohibition on a specific use of NAFs does not provide
the authority to use NAFs.
     4.1.1. Don't use NAFs for purchases requiring interest payments (other than those required by law) or
     carrying charges to non-Government entities.
     4.1.2. When APFs are not available, the commander may approve the conservative use of NAFs for
     paying dues or fees in professional, scientific, or technical societies and associations for personnel
     who act as Air Force liaison to those organizations. Only pay for organizational or "desk" member-
     ships and purchase no more than one membership per base, MAJCOM, FOA, or Air Staff for any
     given professional, scientific, or technical society or association.
     4.1.3. Use NAFs to support an MWR sponsored coupon program to promote participation in MWR
     activities. The Services squadron commander or director approves and sets the value of all MWR
     coupons. Control coupons according to AFI 34-202.
     4.1.4. Use NAFs for promotional mailings including postage when related to the sale of merchandise
     and services (see paragraph 9.4.).
     4.1.5. The use of NAFs to pay registration fees is the same as for APFs (see AFI 65-601V1, US Air
     Force Budget Policies and Procedures).
     4.1.6. When APFs are authorized, use NAFs to purchase equipment for MWR activities only in an
     emergency. The installation commander certifies and identifies the emergency in writing and
     approves waivers to use NAFs instead of APFs for the purchase.
     4.1.7. (Added) When NAF capital expenditures of more than one million dollars are being planned
     for Category C activities, the Public-Private Venture (PPV) alternative must be considered as pre-
     scribed in AFI 64-301, Nonappropriated Fund Contracting Policy, paragraph 8. Before accomplishing
     an economic analysis consider the effect of the potential PPVon the benefit or mission involved and
     the impact on authorized patrons, the MWR program, and the local community. Where an economic
     analysis is required to determine best value for the Air Force, refer to the economic analysis programs
     on the HQ AFSVA web site at http://www-r.afsva.af.mil (under Financial Management). Any PPV

such as:
- Disposal of residual assets (sale, donation, or transfer).
- Redistribution of excess assets (including cash).

                            REAL PROPERTY AND CONSTRUCTION

6.1. Using NAFs for Real Property and Construction.
   6.1.1. For guidance on using NAFs for real property and construction, see this chapter; AFI 34-105,
   Programming For Services Facility Requirements; and AFI 32-1022, Planning and Programming of
   NAF Facility Construction Programs.
   6.1.2. Do not use NAFs to design and construct, alter, recondition, renovate, repair, maintain, or add
   to Government-owned or -leased structures when APFs are authorized. See AFI 65-106 and AFI
   32-1022.

6.2. Capital Improvements. The Air Force Base Capital Improvement Fund (AFBCIF) is the source of
funding for NAF capital improvement grants, when funds are not available at base or MAJCOM level.
   6.2.1. Approval for NAF grants for capital improvement projects depends upon:
       6.2.1.1. Lack of local funds.
       6.2.1.2. Priority of overall Air Force need.
   6.2.2. The CSAF approves capital improvement grants over $200,000.
   6.2.3. Conduct a needs assessment for all NAF capital improvement projects (see AFI 34-105, Pro-
   gramming For Services Facility Requirements).

6.3. Architect-Engineering Services. NAFs usually fund these services for NAF projects, but using
in-house civil engineering design resources is permitted if it requires no additional manpower authoriza-
tions.

6.4. Supervision, Inspection, and Overhead (SIOH) Services. Use NAFs for SIOH of NAF projects
when these services are contracted (including Corp of Engineers) or done by other than base-level staff, or
when base civil engineers can't perform in-house and must hire additional personnel to perform SIOH.

6.5. Leasing Real Property. The MAJCOM/CC approves the use of NAFs for leasing real property for
amounts up to and including $100,000. HQ USAF/SV approves amounts over $100,000.
   6.5.1. Requests for approval of proposed lease agreements must contain the lease agreement and sup-
   port information (see AFI 32-1022). The servicing judge advocate's (JA) office reviews them for
   compliance with AFI 64-301.
   6.5.2. Acquire, execute, and administer the lease in the NAFI's name and stipulate that Government
   lease obligations will be paid solely by NAFs.

6.6. Limitations on Construction.
   6.6.1. A building or structure constructed or purchased with NAFs will not be diverted to a use other
   than in direct support of MWR activities without prior approval from HQ USAF/SV.

                                         NAF EMPLOYEES

7.1. What NAFs Cover. Use NAFs to pay the salaries, wages, and benefits of people who operate MWR
and lodging programs and facilities.
   7.1.1. Manpower standards identify areas that APFs cover. Don't use NAFs in lieu of APFs for those
   positions.
   7.1.2. For positions supporting MWR Fund activities, the MAJCOM SV/FM may approve waivers to
   use NAFs in lieu of APFs on a case-by-case basis (see Attachment 5).
   7.1.3. For positions supporting lodging fund activities, SAF/FMPB approves waivers.

   istration and entitlements of NAF personnel.

7.2. Overpayment of Wages, Allowances, Differentials, or Benefits. The custodian collects overpay-
ments in allowances, differentials, or benefits made to NAF employees (see AFI 34-202).
   7.2.1. See AFI 34-209 for overdrawn leave.
   7.2.2. Waiver authorities for recouping overpayment of wages are:

                                                 Chapter 8

                                                   TAXES

8.1. Tax Payments.
     8.1.1. NAFIs must collect, report, and pay all Federal taxes required by law. Send tax payment
     checks when due to the designated tax collector.
     8.1.2. Report disputes involving taxes to AFLSA/JACL (see AFI 51-301, Civil Litigation). Forward
     a copy to HQ AFSVA/SVL.

8.2. Federal Taxes.
     8.2.1. The Director of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) sets regulations for withholding, deposit-
     ing, paying, and reporting Federal taxes. For general tax guidance on income and Federal Insurance
     Contributions Act taxes, see IRS Circular E and AFI 34-209.
     8.2.2. In the United States, NAFIs that sell alcoholic beverages or beer must have the appropriate
     occupational tax stamp as a wholesale beer dealer, retail beer dealer, wholesale liquor dealer, or retail
     liquor dealer (see AFI 34-119).

8.3. State and Local Taxes.
     8.3.1. As instrumentalities of the United States, NAFIs have the same immunity from state and local
     taxes as the rest of the Federal Government. However, procedures for withholding and paying NAF
     employees' state and local income taxes must conform to the policy applicable to APF employees of
     the Air Force at the same location.
     8.3.2. On any other tax questions involving non-Federal taxing authorities, NAFI custodians consult
     their local servicing JA office.

8.4. Applying State and Local Taxes to Petty Cash Purchases.
     8.4.1. The NAF AO obtains an opinion from its servicing JA office on whether local vendors may
     charge amounts covering state and local tax on NAFI petty cash purchases. Such charges are permis-
     sible when the legal incidence of the taxes does not fall on the purchasing NAFI.
     8.4.2. Where the amounts covering state and local taxes are legally charged to the purchasing NAFI,
     the purchasing individual pays them and is reimbursed for the amounts paid.
     8.4.3. Where the amounts covering state and local taxes can't be legally charged to the purchasing
     NAFI (that is, when the legal incidence of the tax falls on the purchasing NAFI), the following
     requirements apply:
        8.4.3.1. The individual making the NAF purchase tells the vendor that the purchase is for an Air
        Force NAFI and asks that it be tax-free. If the item costs more than a nominal amount ($25), the
        individual normally must provide the vendor with a certification from the servicing JA office or
        the NAF AO that:
            8.4.3.1.1. The purchasing NAFI is an instrumentality of the United States.
AFI34-201_AFRCSUP_I 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                     35


           8.4.3.1.2. It is exempt from state and local taxes. Get the certification from the servicing JA
           office or the NAF AO.
       8.4.3.2. If the vendor insists on charging the taxes, then the purchaser should consider going else-
       where. If the vendor is the only source for the item or good judgment indicates that the amount
       involved doesn't justify the effort of going elsewhere, go ahead and make the purchase. NAFs will
       reimburse the full amount.

8.5. Interest and Penalty Payments. As a general rule, one Federal agency may not assess interest and
penalties against another, except where specifically authorized by law.
   8.5.1. NAFIs must pay interest and penalty assessments under Federal law where the amounts are
   payable to an individual rather than to the Government. Examples are the interest and penalties paid
   to a claimant that are required under the NAF Workers' Compensation Program by the Longshore and
   Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.
   8.5.2. Before payment, the servicing JA office reviews any interest or penalty charges assessed
   against a NAFI by another Federal agency or instrumentality. The servicing JA office or HQ AFSVA/
   SVL can help you respond to the Federal agency.

8.6. Taxes Levied by Foreign Governments. NAFIs usually are exempt from foreign duties and taxes,
either by the express provisions of an international agreement or by recognition that they are United States
instrumentalities. Report any attempted taxation by foreign countries or their political subdivisions to
AFSLA/JACL as required by AFI 51-301. Send a copy to HQ AFSVA/SVL.

8.7. Collecting Taxes for Foreign Governments. NAFIs have no authority to collect taxes for a foreign
government unless the United States has consented to do so by international agreement.

8.8. Tax Reporting for Personal Services Contracts, Awards, Bingo, and Prizes. NAFIs report the
amount paid to any individual when it exceeds a specified dollar amount. See AFI 34-209 for accounting
procedures. The guidance in this paragraph applies to personal services contracts, awards, bingo, and
prizes.
   8.8.1. The NAFI reports NAF personal services contracts, including contracts with entertainers, that
   add up to $600 or more during a calendar year. Report to the IRS on IRS Form 1099 MISC.
   8.8.2. A NAFI must report to the IRS any person who receives cash, prizes, or awards from a NAFI
   for contests, including sporting events and commercial sponsorship, that total $600 or more in any cal-
   endar year. Winnings include the fair market value of payment in any form other than cash (for exam-
   ple, a car, golf cart, television, golf clubs).
   8.8.3. A NAFI must report to the IRS any person who receives a payment of $1,200 or more from one
   bingo game. Determine the value of such winnings as follows:
       8.8.3.1. Don't subtract the selling price of one or more bingo cards for that game from the amount
       of the winnings.
       8.8.3.2. Total all the individual's winnings from one bingo game. If the winner uses two or more
       cards in the same game or receives other payments on a bingo card while playing one game, the
       individual could be a multiple winner in that one game.

     8.8.3.3. Don't include winnings and losses from any other games the winner played; for example,
     winnings on preceding or succeeding games do not accumulate for reporting purposes.

                                                Chapter 9

                                       SPECIAL USES OF NAFS

9.1. Trophies and Awards. The guidance in this paragraph applies when you purchase trophies and
awards with NAFs. Awards involving any form of NAFI profit-sharing are prohibited. Expenditures are
made only when:
- APFs aren't authorized.
- The activities or programs aren't mission-related.
- This chapter authorizes the use of NAFs.
   9.1.1. Use NAFs to purchase trophies and awards for:
       9.1.1.1. Competitive excellence in specified activities and programs.
       9.1.1.2. Individual recognition of achievements authorized by Air Force instructions.
   9.1.2. Use MWR NAFs for:
       9.1.2.1. Trophies, plaques, US savings bonds, property, and cash awards for recreational compet-
       itive contests and events that are:
           9.1.2.1.1. Officially announced in advance.
           9.1.2.1.2. Conducted within a stated period.
           9.1.2.1.3. Open equally to all eligible people and organizations that the NAFI supports.
       9.1.2.2. For volunteers in the Family Services program and the MWR program.
       9.1.2.3. For recognizing participation achievement; for example, complimentary pin or patch for
       bowling a 200 game or 500 series.
   9.1.3. Use NAF funds to pay for the following awards:
       9.1.3.1. For individual recognition programs when approved by the commander according to
       Chapter 12.
       9.1.3.2. For NAF employee incentive award and recognition programs.
       9.1.3.3. For NAF employees participating in the NAFI suggestion program (see AFI 34-301).
   9.1.4. Use CSMSFs for awards for instructor and student incentive programs associated with the
   school's mission.
   9.1.5. To ensure a consistent awards program:
       9.1.5.1. Make the award commensurate with the achievement or accomplishment.
       9.1.5.2. Make sure accomplishment and competition awards are officially established,
       announced, and (usually) of a continuing nature. Give awards annually, unless you wish to honor
       a unique accomplishment or when more frequent awards would clearly benefit the program.
       9.1.5.3. Set processing, evaluation, and award procedures to minimize administrative or tempo-
       rary duty (TDY) costs or both.
38                                                     AFI34-201_AFRCSUP_I 15 NOVEMBER 2007


        9.1.5.4. Limit the number of trophies, plaques, useful property awards, and similar items, as nec-
        essary.
     9.1.6. The Services squadron commander or director annually reviews all award programs and
     decides whether they warrant continuation, as part of the NAF budget process.
     9.1.7. The support group commander approves limits on cash or merchandise awards for sports and
     recreational events. For such events:
        9.1.7.1. Publicize all events to attract as many participants as possible and avoid preferential
        treatment for a select few.
        9.1.7.2. Award only accomplishments achieved in sanctioned play, tournaments, or events rather
        than open, free, or unsupervised activities.
        9.1.7.3. Evaluate the cost of each award against the value of awards from sponsoring associations
        that recognize the same kind of accomplishment (for example, an American Bowling Congress
        award for bowling a 300 game).
        9.1.7.4. Require competitors to acknowledge, in writing, that they understand that accepting cash
        prizes could void their amateur status.
        9.1.7.5. Be prepared to give alternative awards, such as plaques, to those who decline cash. (See
        Chapter 8 for payment of taxes and other AFI 34-series instructions for any further limitations on
        awards for sport competitions.)
     9.1.8. In addition to cash or property, awards may include coupons for rounds of golf, lines of bowl-
     ing, or free use of other MWR activities. The Services squadron commander approves such awards.

9.2. Travel and Transportation.
     9.2.1. Temporary duty (TDY) travel with APFs is authorized for a NAF employee when an autho-
     rized DoD official directs the travel and it is related to business supported by APFs. Publish special
     orders for travel as required by AFI 37-128, Administrative Orders (PA).
     9.2.2. The NAFI directing the travel pays for the travel expenses of NAF officials or employees trav-
     eling on NAF business; that is, the internal operations of the NAFI (as opposed to supervisory func-
     tions that are official Government business).
        9.2.2.1. Never use NAFs for travel to functions that the NAFI doesn't support. For example, don't
        use lodging funds for travel to a conference on family housing.
     9.2.3. All NAF employees traveling to an installation on official APF or NAF TDY travel orders
     should reserve lodging with the applicable base lodging activity whenever possible. NAF employees
     must get a DD Form 1351-5, Government Quarters and Mess, or an assignment to contract quarters
     if they can't get lodging reservations. Otherwise they won't get paid for the quarters portions of the
     per diem or actual expense allowance.
     9.2.4. Use APFs to transport NAF property (see AFI 65-106).
     9.2.5. Regular NAF employees selected for permanent change of station (PCS) transfer to a NAFI at
     another Air Force installation are allowed essential travel and transportation according to AFI 34-301.
AFI34-201_AFRCSUP_I 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                    39


   9.2.6. An individual traveling at NAF expense who receives a bonus coupon, a tangible article (for
   example, clock, radio, bag, golf balls), trading stamp discount document, or another ticket, turns the
   items in to the NAF AO or NAFI custodian. The traveler gets a receipt for the item.
       9.2.6.1. Travelers may enroll in "frequent flyers" or other mileage-accumulation programs to get
       free or discounted travel or airline seat upgrades that ultimately accrue to the NAFI. In addition,
       coupons, discount tickets, and other benefits help defray the cost of future NAF travel.
       9.2.6.2. Tangible items go to an appropriate MWR activity for use by authorized participants.
       9.2.6.3. Inventory accountability depends on the value of the item and its useful life (see AFI
       34-209). When tangible items are received for APF travel, account for them according to AFI
       34-209.
   9.2.7. Use NAFs to buy scheduled commercial airline tickets and recreational tourism services.
       9.2.7.1. Air carriers providing NAF-funded charter flights must:
          9.2.7.1.1. Be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
          9.2.7.1.2. Meet the requirements of part 121 of the FAA regulations.
          9.2.7.1.3. Be authorized by Air Mobility Command (AMC) to perform the services.
       9.2.7.2. Submit requests to charter air carriers using NAFs to HQ AMC/TRC, Scott AFB IL
       62225-5001, 60 days before the chartered flight.

9.3. Fund-Raising Events. See AFI 34-101.

9.4. NAFI Advertising. NAFIs, whether engaged in resale or not, communicate their presence and the
goods and services they offer to as many authorized potential customers as they can.
   9.4.1. Advertising must not reflect unfavorably on the NAFI, the Air Force, the DoD, and the Federal
   Government. See AFI 34-104 for specific guidance on advertising. Note: This advertising policy is
   separate and distinct from the MWR Commercial Sponsorship Policy (see AFI 34-207, Commercial
   Sponsorship Program).
   9.4.2. Only mail materials promoting the sale of specific commercial products or services to custom-
   ers who voluntarily sign up to receive such advertising.
       9.4.2.1. This restriction applies to any mailings containing specific branded products or pricing
       information.
       9.4.2.2. Do not send mail-order catalogs under any circumstances.
   9.4.3. NAFs pay for the cost of promotional mailings including postage.
   9.4.4. NAFIs may:
       9.4.4.1. Purchase or otherwise arrange for advertising produced primarily for distribution on the
       installation or to authorized customers.
       9.4.4.2. Purchase, prepare, or produce advertising items for supported activities (such as ballpoint
       pens or calendars) for distribution to authorized customers.
40                                                     AFI34-201_AFRCSUP_I 15 NOVEMBER 2007


        9.4.4.3. Participate in coupon redemption programs offered to the general public or to the military
        community. Administration and accounting costs associated with the redemption program may
        not exceed the benefits to customers and the NAFI.
     9.4.5. NAFIs may not sell space for commercial advertising. They may not accept any funds to offset
     the cost of advertising that is conditioned on excluding any other product, service, or advertisement or
     granting any additional benefit to a supplier.
        9.4.5.1. Advertising relating to a NAFI must contain a disclaimer if:
        - It is purchased by suppliers or other non-DoD sources.
        - It appears in a medium that the advertised NAFI didn't prepare or produce.
            9.4.5.1.1. The disclaimer must indicate that the advertisements do not express or imply
            endorsement by any part of the Federal Government and that the media involved are neither
            paid for nor sponsored by any part of the Federal Government.
        9.4.5.2. A disclaimer is not required for items provided as premiums.
     9.4.6. Activities may not initiate, sponsor, pay for, or request payment for advertising of particular
     goods or services, with these exceptions:
        9.4.6.1. Activities may purchase advertising to promote Services programs or activities in US
        Armed Forces newspapers and civilian enterprise publications (usually base newspapers) pub-
        lished primarily for distribution on a military installation, when authorized.
        9.4.6.2. The US Armed Forces installation or activity newspapers and American Forces Radio
        and Television Service (AFRTS) may carry unpaid noncommercial news stories, announcements,
        and listings of services that Services activities offer to command or activity personnel. In news
        stories and announcements concerning US Armed Forces professional entertainment events,
        Armed Forces newspapers (including Stars and Stripes), civilian enterprise publication, and
        AFRTS outlets, include the name of commercial sponsors with other story facts and appropriate
        disclaimers.
     9.4.7. Services activities and programs may not produce, procure, distribute, or sell any media,
     printed or otherwise, containing commercial advertising (includes air show souvenir programs).

9.5. Open Houses and Air Shows. See AFI 34-101.

9.6. NAFI Vehicles. See AFI 34-204 for specific guidance.
     9.6.1. Use NAFI vehicles for official Services and NAFI purposes only. Don't use them for private
     business, unofficial purposes, or personal convenience.
     9.6.2. Don't use them for base protocol requirements unless the installation commander authorizes
     each use in writing.
        9.6.2.1. Each authorization states that the vehicle is being temporarily assigned to the protocol
        function and states the duration of the assignment.
        9.6.2.2. When used for protocol, the vehicle is serving an APF function and the NAF self-insur-
        ance liability program does not apply. Drivers must be in an official duty status.
     9.6.3. For NAF vehicles being used for APF functions:
AFI34-201_AFRCSUP_I 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                41


      9.6.3.1. Always use an APF driver.
      9.6.3.2. Make sure that the proposed use doesn't conflict with the vehicle's primary NAF mission.
      9.6.3.3. Limit the vehicle's use to purposes approved for APF vehicles.
      9.6.3.4. Don't allow or require APF or NAF reimbursement.

                      WAIVERS, EXCEPTIONS, AND SPECIAL APPROVALS

10.1. Waivers and Exceptions. Identify this paragraph as the authority for waiver of this AFI.
     10.1.1. MAJCOM supplements to Air Force instructions may limit specific base-level waiver author-
     ities. MAJCOMs may not approve waivers that prescribe base-level actions, nor may they approve
     blanket waivers within their jurisdiction for their bases. Consider each waiver request separately.
     10.1.2. Only those procedures and guidelines that specifically reference this instruction are eligible
     for waiver.
     10.1.3. Waivers and exceptions to policy for civilian welfare funds and base restaurants require
     advance approval from the Board of Directors, AAFCWF (AFJI 34-122).

10.2. Submitting Requests for Air Force Approval.
     10.2.1. To get a waiver, special authorization, change in policy, or other such exception, first get
     approval for the request from the installation commander. If the request requires Air Force level
     approval, you may then forward the request (with justification) through the MAJCOM to HQ AFSVA/
     SVQ for approval.
     10.2.2. HQ USAF/SV will approve or disapprove.

   11.1.1. A tenant is:
       11.1.1.1. A military organization of one service that occupies facilities on an installation under
       the jurisdiction of another service. (See DoDD 1015.1 for guidance on providing MWR fund ben-
       efits to tenant organizations of another service.)
       11.1.1.2. An Air Force organization of one MAJCOM or FOA located on or attached to an Air
       Force installation under the jurisdiction of another MAJCOM.
   11.1.2. The host is one of two entities:
       11.1.2.1. The MAJCOM that has jurisdiction over the installation or other real property that the
       tenant occupies.
       11.1.2.2. The organization that the host MAJCOM or HQ USAF designates to furnish tenant sup-
       port.
   11.1.3. Host commanders oversee all aspects of MWR operations. They provide the same MWR ser-
   vices and benefits for tenants as for comparable organizations in their commands.
   11.1.4. A MAJCOM/SV may help meet unique requirements of an organization tenanted on facilities
   of another command when the parent command considers it necessary.

11.2. Isolated Units.
   11.2.1. An isolated unit is an organization that meets both of these criteria:
   - Isn't located on a military installation with MWR programs or isn't located within 15 miles of such
   an installation.
   - Does not receive an AAFES dividend distribution.
       11.2.1.1. Isolated units may also include:
          11.2.1.1.1. Security groups, recruiting, communication, or weather detachments.
          11.2.1.1.2. Military training groups at colleges and universities.
          11.2.1.1.3. Radar squadrons.
          11.2.1.1.4. Military advisory assistance groups operating in locations without NAF assistance
          (see AFI 16-104, Attache Affairs).

11.3. Getting MWR Support for Isolated Units. When a unit is within 15 miles of a military installa-
tion with MWR programs, the unit receives its MWR support from that military installation.
   11.3.1. Stipulate in a support agreement with the installation that the installation will:
       11.3.1.1. Provide access to installation MWR facilities and services.
       11.3.1.2. Allow the isolated unit full participation in MWR programs.

        11.3.1.3. Provide other support as established by the installation commander.
     11.3.2. Report problems in obtaining needed support through command channels for resolution.
     11.3.3. On-the-spot assistance on MWR matters is available to smaller units that can't employ person-
     nel or are not authorized assigned personnel for MWR programs.

11.4. Establishing an Isolated Unit.
     11.4.1. An isolated unit may establish a support agreement with any Air Force installation within a
     15-mile radius, regardless of whether other military installations may be closer.
     11.4.2. An isolated unit may establish an agreement for MWR support with only one military instal-
     lation at a time.
     11.4.3. Include intra-command support in the support agreement.
        11.4.3.1. The MAJCOM/SVF negotiates such agreements and gets approval from the host-tenant
        MAJCOM. The MAJCOM/SVF approves a memorandum of understanding (MOU), including
        the intra-command support provided.
        11.4.3.2. The isolated unit fund (IUF) custodian keeps a copy of the MOU in the Life-of-the-Fund
        file.
     11.4.4. Isolated units are not necessarily entitled to host base MWR funds for unit parties and picnics.
        11.4.4.1. Installations may choose to provide such support (see paragraph 4.3.4.).
        11.4.4.2. Don't use any NAF source to provide supplemental funding for unit parties and picnics
        when local installation MWR programs do not include such support.
     11.4.5. HQ AFSVA provides funding annually for Defense Attache Offices based on estimated mili-
     tary strength and adjusted to actual expenses at the end of the fiscal year.
     11.4.6. Establish an isolated unit as an isolated unit fund when the unit's revenues exceed, or are
     expected to exceed, $36,500 per year. The isolated unit fund is subject to all regulations, reporting,
     and other requirements of MWR funds.

11.5. Determining MWR Support for Isolated Units.
     11.5.1. Isolated Unit Report (RCS:HAF-SV [A&Q] 9469). Annually, by 1 October (with data as of
     1 August), each MAJCOM/SV sends HQ AFSVA/SVF a listing of its isolated units. This report is
     designated emergency status code C3. Continue reporting during emergency conditions, delayed pre-
     cedence. Submit data requirements as prescribed, but they may be delayed to allow the submission of
     higher precedence reports. During emergency conditions, submit by nonelectronic means, if possible.
     Discontinue reporting during MINIMIZE. This report includes:
     - The unit name and location.
     - Military strength by branch of service.
     - Name and distance from closest military installation.
     - Location Personal Accounting Symbol (PAS) code.
     - Any additional MWR support a unit receives.
AFI34-201_AFRCSUP_I 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                   45


       11.5.1.1. Units with more than 100 military personnel provide this report by the first day of each
       quarter with data as of 2 months prior.
   11.5.2. HQ AFSVA/SVF provides funding to each MAJCOM, for support of its isolated units annu-
   ally or quarterly (as reported in paragraph 11.5.1.), at a per capita rate that HQ USAF/SV establishes.
       11.5.2.1. To determine the equivalent full-time strength of ANG and Reserve units, multiply their
       authorized strength by 5 percent and apply the per capita funding formula to the result.

11.6. Accounting for MWR Disbursements to Isolated Units.
   11.6.1. The MAJCOM accounts for MAJCOM or base (if the MAJCOM assigns support responsibil-
   ity to a base) disbursements to isolated units. Accounting is in accordance with AFI 34-209.
   11.6.2. The allocating NAFI transfers NAFs for ANG units to the United States Property and Fiscal
   Officer (USPFO) for the state involved. Allocated NAFs remain assets of the allocating NAFI until
   they are actually expended.
       11.6.2.1. The USPFO establishes a single bank account (checking or savings) for these NAFs.
   11.6.3. Do not commingle NAFs with any other type of funds (state, Federal, private, or other).
       11.6.3.1. If more than one NAFI allocates funds (for example, if the state has ANG units sup-
       ported by more than one MAJCOM or base), the NAFs that the USPFO receives may be commin-
       gled, but they must be accounted for in such a way that allocations from a supporting NAFI are
       used for ANG units entitled to support from that NAFI.
       11.6.3.2. The USPFO disburses NAFs to support ANG units as needed. Use of these NAFs is
       according to the provisions of this AFI.

11.7. Disbursing Funds to Isolated Units.
   11.7.1. MAJCOMs provide support to their units at intervals that the MAJCOM establishes.
   11.7.2. A MAJCOM/SV may designate a base MWR fund within the command to provide MWR
   fund support to an isolated unit.
   11.7.3. An isolated unit fund may act as a consolidated NAFI to account for the funds of other iso-
   lated units that the same MAJCOM or base MWR fund supports. The fund may include other MAJ-
   COM or other military service units by agreement.
   11.7.4. A MAJCOM/SV may provide MWR funds to the parent organization to use for a group of
   isolated units or detachments.
   11.7.5. If funds provided to a MAJCOM for a unit are not disbursed to the unit, the MAJCOM returns
   the funds to the AFMWRF.
       11.7.5.1. Annually, each MAJCOM reports funds disbursed to their units.
       11.7.5.2. HQ AFSVA determines the amount, if any, the MAJCOM must return to the AFMWRF.
   11.7.6. Provide additional MWR funds to isolated units from command funds, if the parent command
   thinks it necessary.

                                                Chapter 12

           SUPPORT FOR SPECIAL MORALE AND WELFARE (SM&W) PURPOSES

12.1. SM&W Expenditures.
     12.1.1. SM&W expenditures are NAF expenditures considered necessary to contribute to the overall
     morale and welfare of the military community. SM&W expenditures must:
        12.1.1.1. Be conservative.
        12.1.1.2. Be in the best interests of the Air Force.
        12.1.1.3. Benefit the military community.
        12.1.1.4. Not be limited to specific grades or levels of personnel.
     12.1.2. Don't use SM&W funds in lieu of APFs for purposes authorized in AFI 65-603, Official Rep-
     resentation Funds, unless specifically authorized in this chapter.

12.2. Commander Responsibilities.
     12.2.1. Commanders may approve expenditures of NAFs from the applicable MWRF for SM&W
     purposes according to this chapter.
        12.2.1.1. Obtain advance approval prior to all SM&W expenditures. Commanders establish pro-
        cedures to ensure that all SM&W expenditures are approved in advance.
        12.2.1.2. Commanders may delegate expenditure approval authority up to specific amounts for
        recurring functions such as civic affairs, conferences, recognition programs, and occasions that
        orient members of the command.
        12.2.1.3. MAJCOM, FOA, and Numbered Air Force commanders may delegate approval author-
        ity to the director of staff-level for all other expenditures.
        12.2.1.4. Commanders below these levels may not delegate approval authority.
        12.2.1.5. Persons who are delegated authority to approve purchases must comply with AFI
        64-301, where NAF purchases are involved.
        12.2.1.6. Commanders may establish a petty cash fund to expedite small item purchasing.
     12.2.2. MAJCOM commanders ensure the program's integrity by personally monitoring base-level
     expenditures and requiring and reviewing quarterly reports of base-level SM&W expenditures. They
     or their delegates (see paragraph 12.2.1.) approve or disapprove SM&W expenditures from the MAJ-
     COM MWR fund.
        12.2.2.1. Subordinate commanders and commanders of units that other MAJCOMs support sub-
        mit a quarterly report of all SM&W expenditures to their supporting MAJCOM commander. Use
        Expenditures for SM&W Purposes, RCS: HAF-MWR(Q)8401. This report is designated emer-
        gency status code C3. Continue reporting during emergency conditions, delayed precedence.
        Submit data requirements as prescribed, but they may be delayed to allow the submission of
        higher precedence reports. Submit by nonelectronic means, if possible. Discontinue reporting
        during MINIMIZE. Itemize each expenditure, the dollar amount, purpose, items or services pur-
        chased, and recipients. Include command-level expenditures in quarterly reports.
AFI34-201_AFRCSUP_I 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                  47


      12.2.2.2. A HQ AFSVA representative periodically visits MAJCOMs to evaluate their manage-
      ment of the SM&W program. This representative provides a written report of findings to the
      MAJCOM/SV for resolution with the command section.
      12.2.2.3. MAJCOMs must respond to the finding in writing, indicating what corrective actions
      they're taking.
   12.2.3. Host commanders have an obligation to fulfill the SM&W requirements for their unit com-
   manders, tenant unit commanders on their bases, and off-base unit commanders for which they have
   MWRF support responsibility. Requests for SM&W funds follow the format at Attachment 6.
   12.2.3. (AFRC) Individuals requesting SM&W funds complete and forward an AFRC Form 211,
   Request for Special Morale and Welfare (SM&W) Funds (Attachment 9 (Added)).
   12.2.4. The commander decides what SM&W needs will be met and closely scrutinizes each expen-
   diture to avoid criticism or embarrassment to the Air Force. Initially forward all requests for SM&W
   expenditures to FM for funding from APFs (see AFI 65-603, Official Representation Funds):
      12.2.4.1. If FM certifies that representation funds are not authorized, you may submit a request to
      use NAFs for an authorized SM&W expenditure.
      12.2.4.2. If APF representation funds are authorized but not available, don't use NAFs for the
      SM&W expenditures.
   12.2.5. Commanders must exercise restraint in using SM&W funds for purposes described in this
   chapter so that basic MWR programs and services are not deprived of the NAF resources required to
   ensure their effectiveness. The authorization for SM&W expenditures does not constitute a com-
   mander's fund in any sense.

12.3. MWR Fund Custodian Responsibilities.
   12.3.1. The custodian:
      12.3.1.1. Briefs incoming commanders who exercise SM&W expenditure authority on the provi-
      sions in this chapter.
      12.3.1.2. Prepares quarterly reports and accounts for all SM&W expenditures using guidance in
      AFI 34-209.
   12.3.2. The custodian inventories and controls refreshments, mementos, and other stock items and
   ensures that mementos are not purchased for resale.
   12.3.3. The custodian establishes sound stock control procedures.
      12.3.3.1. Ensure that the inventory system provides a clear audit trail for items purchased and
      records the specific purposes and events for which the items were issued. (You may control
      mementos manually using stock record or bin cards or computerize these records.)
      12.3.3.2. Conduct an annual inventory and provide an inventory report to the commander. Make
      sure that independent persons conduct the inventory, with help from the memento custodian. The
      MWR fund custodian keeps all inventory certifications for audit purposes.
      12.3.3.3. Don't mix inventory items purchased from SM&W funds with items purchased from
      appropriated contingency (official representation) or other funds.

        12.3.3.4. Reconcile expenditure-supporting documents with amounts in quarterly reports and
        with financial statements submitted through the NAF Standard Accounting and Management Sys-
        tem.

12.4. Permissible Expenditures. Commanders and others delegated approval authority will not expend
funds for SM&W purposes if funds are authorized elsewhere in this instruction or authorized from APFs
(AFI 65-603), unless this paragraph cites them as an exception. This paragraph lists examples of permis-
sible expenditures.

                                  TEXT OF IC 99-1 TO AFI 34-201
1 OCTOBER 1999
SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This change identifies new DoD policy requiring consideration of Public-Private Ventures (PPVs) to sat-
isfy Category C capital requirements exceeding $1 million. It complements a change to AFI 64-301,
Nonappropriated Fund Contracting Policy (IC 99-1, 13 May 99). Paragraph 4.1.7. is added to identify the
new requirement and provide a vehicle for conducting any economic analysis required.
4.1.7. When NAF capital expenditures of more than one million dollars are being planned for Category C
activities, the Public-Private Venture (PPV) alternative must be considered as prescribed in AFI 64-301,
Nonappropriated Fund Contracting Policy, paragraph 8. Before accomplishing an economic analysis con-
sider the effect of the potential PPVon the benefit or mission involved and the impact on authorized
patrons, the MWR program, and the local community. Where an economic analysis is required to deter-
mine best value for the Air Force, refer to the economic analysis programs on the HQ AFSVA web site at
http://www-r.afsva.af.mil (under Financial Management). Any PPV contract/agreement requires prior
written approval from HQ USAF/ILV.
