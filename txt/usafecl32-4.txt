This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 32-10, Installations and Facilities. The
Inspection Checklist is developed to support AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities, and the USAFE
Supplement 1, inspection programs. This checklist identifies compliance items that support guidance in
the following: law, executive order, higher headquarters publication (Department of Defense (DoD), Air
Force Instruction (AFI), Air Force Manual (AFMAN), Air Force Technical Order (AFTO), etc.) and
major command (MAJCOM) publications. It applies to all USAFE Fire and Emergency Services Flights
and members as indicated in paragraph 2. It does not apply to Air National Guard (ANG) or Air Force
Reserve Command (AFRC) units. It supports guidance in AFI 32-2001, The Fire Protection Operations
and Fire Prevention Program. Units can supplement this publication to add internal compliance items.
This checklist is intended for inspection use. Send comments and suggested improvements to this publi-
cation on AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, to Readiness Division, HQ
USAFE/A7CX, Unit 3050 Box 10, APO AE 09094-5010. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123, Management
of Records and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located
at: https://webrims.amc.af.mil. Ensure that any local instructions or supplements are created in accor-
dance with AFI 33-360 Volume1, Air Force Content Management Program-Publications.


1. General. The items listed do not constitute the order or limit the scope of the inspection or assessment.
As a minimum, units should use the checklist in conjunction with the Unit Self-Assessment. The objec-
tive is to identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required capabilities. Higher headquarters may
use this checklist in whole or in part during visits or exercises.
   1.1. Core Compliance Guide Items (CCGI) and Compliance Guide Items (CGI). Items identi-
   fied by functional managers to prioritize command requirements and to allow the Inspector General
   (HQ USAFE/IG) inspectors to assess criticality of deficiencies.
       1.1.1. CCGI. Items identified by HQ USAFE directorates and functional managers as key result
       areas for successful mission accomplishment including, but not limited to, items where non-com-

           pliance could result in serious injury, loss of life, excessive cost, litigation or affect system reliabil-
           ity. These requirements may be mandated by law, Executive Order, DoD directive, safety or Air
           Force and USAFE strategic plans. CCGIs are referred to as significant guide items requiring
           direct IG evaluation. Identify CCGIs by using uppercase and bold letters.
           1.1.2. CGI. CGI are areas that require special vigilance and are important to the overall perfor-
           mance of the unit. Noncompliance could result in some negative impact on mission performance
           but is not likely to result in injury, unnecessary cost, or litigation. Identify CGIs by using standard
           sentence case.

2. Applicability. All items on this inspection checklist are assigned an applicability code designating to
which type of unit the item applies. Applicability code 3 designates the following Main Operating Bases
(MOB): Aviano, Incirlik, Lakenheath, Mildenhall, Ramstein, and Spangdahlem. Applicability code 11
designates the following: North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Host Nation Units.
