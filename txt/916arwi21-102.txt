   walk. The UTA FOD walk will be conducted quarterly or as directed by the 916 MXG/CC.
   UTA FOD walk will begin at 0730 hours on Saturday. FOD walks may be delayed due to
   circumstances such as weather or other mission requirements. All 916 ARW organizations

   Operations Center (MOC), as required. The FOD BOSS (located in the AMXS tool room)
   will be used a minimum of once per week by qualified personnel. FOD BOSS use may be
   delayed due to circumstances such as weather or other mission requirements.
   2.3. Each day, before any engine start, the Crew Chiefs and or Specialists will inspect the
   area for foreign objects around the aircraft to include cockpit and flight deck area. Policing

     Personnel will check parking spots again after aircraft has taxied away for loose concrete and
     other foreign objects.
     2.4. Run fences will be inspected for deficiencies prior to use. Run fences found with
     discrepancies will be removed from service and reported to the Aerospace Ground
     Equipment Section. Run fences will be re-inspected after completion of maintenance engine
     run.
     2.5. During unit deployment, maintenance personnel will conduct initial FOD prevention
     measures of this instruction upon arrival at the deployed location. A FOD walk of the
     taxiways and assigned aircraft parking areas designated for 916 ARW aircraft will be
     conducted. Maintenance supervision will ensure weekly FOD walks are accomplished.
3. Vehicles Operating on the Flight Line
     3.1. If vehicles are driven off the flight line or off paved surfaces, the tires and magnetic bars
     (if installed) will be inspected before the vehicle re-enters the maintenance area. At no time
     will the vehicle be driven in excess of 15 miles per hour with a FOD magnetic bar in position
     (either remove FOD bar or raise the bar up as high as possible, to accommodate speeds
     higher than 15 mph). All vehicles, including golf carts, involved in maintenance on the flight
     line will have a FOD container attached to the vehicle. Container will be with the word
     “FOD” in contrasting letters no smaller than two inches.
     3.2. All vehicle operators, as part of the daily vehicle inspection, will check for cleanliness,
     loose hardware, and tire entrapped objects to prevent foreign objects from being transported
     onto the flight line.
     3.3. All vehicles will stop at the designated FOD tire Check Points and perform a rolling
     FOD check. A FOD removal tool will be added to key rings of all vehicles normally driven
     on the flight line.
4. FOD Incident Reporting and Data Tracking
     4.1. Individuals who discover FOD will report the incident to Maintenance Operations
     Center (MOC). The MOC will notify Quality Assurance and the Wing FODPP monitor.
     When FOD is identified, other than minor nicks and scratches on engine fan blades, the Wing
     FOD monitor will be notified prior to blade blending. The Wing FODPP monitor will ensure
     blade blending worksheet (Attachment 3) is filled out by the individual that is performing the
     blend and then forwarded to Engine Management for input into the engines maintenance
     history records.
     4.2. Quality Assurance will calculate the work hours and material cost attributed for each
     FOD incident and report the cost at each quarterly FOD meeting. Reports are used to track
     the progress of the FOD inspection program.
     4.3. For all incidents involving bird strikes and bird ingestion into the engine during flight, a
     916 Form 3, Aircraft Incident Investigation, will be accomplished during aircrew debrief.
     MOC will ensure that the 916 Form 3 and AF Form 853, Air Force Wildlife Strike Report,
     are completed and given to the 4th Fighter Wing BASH Team (in accordance with AFPAM
     91-212, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Management Techniques) and the 916
     Wing FODPP monitor not later than the next duty day after the incident occurred.

   4.4. FOD discovered on post engine run inspections, will be reported immediately to the
   expediter. The expediter will notify Wing Safety and the Wing FODPP monitor.
   4.5. When an aircraft is off station and has a FOD incident, the senior enlisted maintenance
   personnel will complete the 916 Form 3 and fax it to the Wing FODPP monitor not later than
   the next duty day after the incident occurred. FAX number DSN 722-2934, Commercial
   919-722-2934.
5. Quarterly FOD Prevention Meeting
   5.1. The 916 ARW/CV will chair the quarterly FOD prevention meeting. The 916 MXG/CC
   will chair the chair the meeting in the 916 ARW/CV’s absence. All group commanders,
   director(s), commanders of units with maintenance personnel, safety, CE, Airfield Manager,
   security forces, and unit FOD representatives will attend. If any of the aforementioned FOD
   representatives cannot attend, a designated representative from each unit will attend. This
   meeting will be conducted in conjunction with the quarterly 916 ARW Dropped Object
   Committee meeting. Agenda for the meeting will include a review of FOD incidents,
   dropped objects, lost tools/objects, bird strikes, FOD inspection/assessment results,
   identification of potential FOD sources, and Golden Bolt Award winner(s) being recognized.
6. Golden Bolt Award Program
   6.1. The Wing FODPP Monitor or QA representative will place the Golden Bolt on the
   aircraft parking ramp at least once a quarter at a random time and location. The individual
   placing the golden bolt will monitor its recovery.
   6.2. The individual who finds the Golden Bolt and returns it to the QA office is the winner.
   The person receiving the golden bolt from the individual will take the finder’s full name,
   supervisor’s name and flight assigned. This information will be forwarded to the Wing
   FODPP Monitor. The individual will then be appropriately recognized or rewarded by the
   individuals’ squadron and/or 916 ARW/CV.
