                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Aircrew Responsibility. This volume, in conjuction with other governing directives,
prescribes those procedures applicable to the operation of E-3 aircraft under most circumstances.
It is not a substitute for sound judgement. Procedures not specifically addressed may be
accomplished if they enhance safe and effective mission accomplishment.
1.2. Deviations. Deviations from these procedures require specific approval of the
MAJCOM/A3 unless an urgent requirement or an aircraft emergency dictate otherwise. In that
case, the Pilot In Command (PIC) will take the appropriate action to safely recover the aircraft.
1.3. Waivers. Unless specifically noted otherwise in the appropriate section, waiver authority
for requirements of this volume is the applicable MAJCOM/A3. Forward waiver requests
through appropriate channels to the MAJCOM/A3 for approval. All approvals will include an
expiration date. HQ ACC/A3TV and HQ ACC/A3YA are Office of Collateral Responsibility
(OCR) on all waiver requests to this AFI.
1.4. Recommended Changes. Send comments and suggested improvements to this volume on
an AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, through channels to the parent
NAF and MAJCOM. Forward approved recommendations to HQ ACC/A3YA. HQ USAF/A3/5
is the approval authority for Interim Changes to this instruction.
1.5. Distribution. Issue this volume to E-3 aircrew members IAW local procedures.

                                             Chapter 2

                                      MISSION PLANNING

2.1. Responsibilities. The responsibility for mission planning rests with the Aircraft
Commander (AC). Preparation for mission tasking and subsequent execution is the responsibility
of the Mission Crew Commander (MCC). The operations functions of the unit will support both
efforts. Flying crews may perform their own mission planning or units may utilize mission
planning teams or planning cells in order to meet mission planning requirements. In any case,
qualified individuals will be designated to perform mission planning and/or briefings. Units will
develop specific procedures to ensure all aircrew members are thoroughly prepared for each
flight.
2.2. Forms and Logs. Specific flight plans, logs, and mission forms will be
developed/specified by the appropriate group commander. Existing AF and MAJCOM forms
should be used to the maximum extent possible.
2.3. Fuel Conservation. Aircrew and mission planners will manage aviation fuel as a limited
commodity and precious resource. Fuel optimization will be considered throughout all phases of
mission planning and execution. Excessive ramp and recovery fuel adds to aircraft gross weight
and increases fuel consumption. Do not ferry extra fuel beyond optimum requirements for safe
mission accomplishment and training objectives. Aircrew and mission planners will optimize
flight plans and flight routing for fuel efficiency. In-flight procedures such as climb/descent
profiles and power settings should also be considered for efficient fuel usage. Aircrew should
employ the following aviation fuel optimization measures without compromising flight safety or
jeopardizing mission/training accomplishment:
     2.3.1. Optimize fuel loads. Mission plan for the required ramp and recovery fuel. Ensure
     ramp fuel is correct upon arrival at aircraft.
     2.3.2. Minimize APU use. Use ground power units when practical.
     2.3.3. Delay engine start time. Establish and implement local engines start time standards.
     2.3.4. Minimize aircraft weight through optimized fuel loads and reduction of equipment not
     necessary to accomplish the mission.
     2.3.5. Establish Command and Control (C2) and flight following procedures to ensure timely
     notification of mission changes/cancellations to avoid unnecessary or unproductive flight
     time.
2.4. Navigational Charts.
     2.4.1. Annotate an appropriately scaled navigational chart with the route of flight and the
     following:
        2.4.1.1. Special Use Airspace (SUA) within the altitude structure and within 50 NM of
        the route of flight/orbit airspace.
        2.4.1.2. Mission airspace, E-3 orbit airspace, and E-3 air refueling airspace.
        2.4.1.3. Emergency airfields sufficient to cover the route of flight.
        2.4.1.4. High terrain within 50 NM of the route of flight.
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                            9


       2.4.1.5. ADIZ boundaries within 50 NM of the route of flight.
       2.4.1.6. Equal Time Point (ETP) and FIR boundaries as required.
   2.4.2. Annotate an Operational Navigation Chart (ONC), or larger scale, with the planned
   departure/arrival airfield and the following:
       2.4.2.1. Planned departure/arrival procedure.
       2.4.2.2. Special Departure Procedure (SDP).
       2.4.2.3. Highest terrain or obstacle along expected route of flight.
       2.4.2.4. Highest terrain or obstacle within 30 NM.
NOTE:
Units will, if necessary, specify flight plan requirements and procedures in their local chapters to
meet specialized mission requirements.
2.5. Mission Planning Requirements. The appropriate group commander may waive
requirements contained in this paragraph if deemed necessary to accomplish a specific mission.
   2.5.1. Briefings/Debriefings.
       2.5.1.1. The AC/MCC will brief/debrief all crewmembers to ensure safe/effective
       mission accomplishment. Locally developed briefing guides (developed IAW AFI 11-
       202V3) will be used to provide a reference list of items that apply to a particular mission
       and will be used as the basis for mission planning and briefing actions. Brief items in any
       logical sequence, and those items understood by all participants may be briefed as
       ―Standard‖. All aircrew members will attend these briefings unless excused by the
       AC/MCC or unless local procedures dictate otherwise.
NOTE:
 Units will develop and document guidance for items that are commonly briefed as ―Standard‖.
The purpose of unit or local standards is to reduce the briefing time of administrative tasks to
allow for concentration on the mission. In no case do these procedures relieve the aircrew of the
responsibility to comply with USAF directives. Aircrew will use these procedures unless
conditions, objectives or execution dictate the aircraft commander to brief as ―non-standard.‖
       2.5.1.2. Passengers. The AC will assign a crewmember to be responsible for passengers
       or distinguished visitors; reference Transportation of Passengers in paragraph 3.12 in
       this instruction for minimum responsibilities.
       2.5.1.3. Aircraft and Aircrew Status. Aircraft status will be obtained on the day of the
       flight from the appropriate maintenance unit including open discrepancies from the Air
       Force Technical Order (AFTO) Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work
       Document. Aircrew status will be obtained from ARMS personnel. Aircraft and aircrew
       status will be briefed/addressed as appropriate.
       2.5.1.4. Controller Assisted Rendezvous. Either the AC or Nav will review the Air-to-
       Air Refueling (AAR) rendezvous procedures and techniques with the AWO. The Nav
       will supply the AWO with the following information:
           2.5.1.4.1. AAR Initial Point (ARIP) and AAR Control Point (ARCP) coordinates in
           degrees LAT/LONG.
 10                                         AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


          2.5.1.4.2. AAR altitudes.
          2.5.1.4.3. Desired tanker offset and turn range, if necessary.
          2.5.1.4.4. Range and offset calls desired during the rendezvous.
          2.5.1.4.5. Any alternate procedures.
          2.5.1.4.6. Transponder codes (on day of flight,if available).
       2.5.1.5. Controller Directed Rendezvous. The AWO will brief the flight deck on the
       AAR rendezvous procedure to be employed. The AWO will brief the following
       information:
          2.5.1.5.1. AAR rendezvous type.
          2.5.1.5.2. AAR altitude.
          2.5.1.5.3. Anticipated turn ranges/direction.
       2.5.1.6. Orbit Planning. The AC and Nav will coordinate with the MCC, SD, ASO, and
       ECO to determine optimum orbit configuration based on tasking and orbit limitations.
   2.5.2. Mission Crew Planning. The following items will be accomplished during mission
   planning:
       2.5.2.1. MCC will ensure mission activities are planned according to applicable
       checklists and guides.
       2.5.2.2. MCC, SD, ASO, ECO, CSO, and Battle Staff will develop a communication
       plan to ensure accomplishment of mission requirements.
       2.5.2.3. The CDMT will coordinate all computer software requirements. Minimum
       software requirements will be IAW local operating procedures.
       2.5.2.4. The MCC will assess impact of equipment limitations and adjust tasking as
       necessary. The MCC will conduct a final review of mission crew planning.
2.6. Local Checklists/Aircrew Aids. Locally produced checklists and aircrew aids will include
as a minimum:
   2.6.1. Mission planning checklists (as required).
   2.6.2. Briefing guides (as required).
2.7. Theater Procedures Aircrew Aids. The unit specifically tasked to support an area of
operations will develop theater procedure aircew aids (classified/unclassified) and make them
available to the crew upon implementation of a contingency Operations Plan (OPLAN) for
deployment to the theater. As a minimum, these aids will include:
   2.7.1. Communications plans.
   2.7.2. Flight and mission crew positional actions/procedures.
   2.7.3. Rules of Engagement (ROE).

                                           Chapter 3

                         AIRCREW OPERATING PROCEDURES

3.1. PIC Responsibilities. SQ/CC shall designate an AC, Instructor Pilot (IP), or Evaluator
Pilot (EP) as the PIC for all flights, on a flight authorization form, IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation
Management, and applicable supplements. The PIC is responsible for the safe, effective conduct
of flight operations. The aircrew is responsible to the PIC for the successful accomplishment of
all flight activities IAW AFI 11-202V3 and applicable MAJCOM supplements. PIC
responsibilities and/or authority include:
   3.1.1. Managing crew resources and safe mission accomplishment.
   3.1.2. Welfare of the crew.
   3.1.3. Final word for requesting or accepting any waivers affecting the crew or mission.
   3.1.4. Ensuring that any portion of the flight affecting the accomplishment of the E-3
   mission is coordinated with the MCC.
3.2. Crew Manning:
   3.2.1. Minimum flight crew manning includes the AC, Copilot (CP) or FP, Nav, and Flight
   Engineer (FE).
   3.2.2. Proficiency (P)-sorties will be flown with a minimum of five crewmembers: AC, CP,
   Nav, FE, and one additional crewmember to act as safety observer. The applicable
   Operations Group Commander (OG/CC) has the waiver authority to authorize a flight
   without a safety observer.
   3.2.3. Minimum mission crew manning to power up the mission systems will include MCC,
   ASO, ART, CDMT, CT, and CSO. Mission crew manning may vary by the type mission
   flown.
   3.2.4. Normally, aircrew manning for operational employment will be IAW AFI 65-503, US
   Air Force Cost and Planning Factors, Table A36-1. Mission crew manning may vary by the
   type of mission flown; SQ/DO or DETCO may tailor aircrew manning to meet operational
   requirements.
   3.2.5. Unless waived by the SQ CC/DO, inexperienced CDMTs will fly with an experienced
   CDMT and inexperienced ARTs will fly with an experienced ART at all times until
   experience requirements are met.
3.3. Crew Rest/Flight Duty Period (FDP)/Crew Augmentation: Crew rest, flight duty period
and crew augmentation will be IAW AFI 11-202V3 and applicable MAJCOM supplements with
the following additional guidance.
   3.3.1. With autopilot, altitude hold, or any axis of the autopilot inoperative, limit basic FDP
   to 12 hours and augmented FDP to 16 hours.
   3.3.2. Flight crew augmentation.
 12                                         AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


       3.3.2.1. Minimum crew augmentation will consist of a qualified AC or FP, Nav, and FE
       in addition to the normal flight crew. Adding flight crewmembers after the first takeoff in
       a crew duty period is not considered augmentation.
       3.3.2.2. The applicable OG/CC (or as delegated) will determine the augmented mission
       crew composition depending upon mission requirements.
   3.3.3. Non-duty Time. Crewmembers will be afforded 12 hours of non-duty time after a
   flight before reporting for normal non-flying duties, unless waived by SQ CC/DO.
   3.3.4. Crew Rest Timing. Crew rest for successive flight activity will begin when the last
   crewmember departs after completing related aircrew duties but not earlier than 1 hour after
   final landing from previous flight activity.
   3.3.5. Crew Rest for Deploying/Redeploying Aircrews. When transitioning four time zones
   or more, unless waived by applicable operations group commander, ground time between
   landing and subsequent takeoff will not be planned for less than 18 hours. This does not
   apply to ―Ops stops‖ made within an aircrew duty period.
   3.3.6. Management of AFRC Crewmembers. The on-scene commander or E-3 DETCO is
   responsible for the effective management of aircrews. An element of that responsibility is the
   effective use of the Reserve associate aircrew personnel during their periods of availability.
   There is no guarantee that missions will always be completed at scheduled Mission End Time
   (MET). Therefore, it is incumbent upon Reserve associate crew members to make available
   sufficient time to accommodate unavoidable delays in returning to home station. Scheduled
   Return Time (SRT) will be calculated MET plus 24 hours for routine exercise and
   operational deployments. SRT(s) for contingencies and missions of unknown duration will be
   determined by the 513 ACG/CC and 552 OG/CC or the requesting authority in coordination
   with HQ AFRC. The SRT will be determined and placed on the initial and subsequent flight
   authorizations until the mission is complete. The overall objective is to recover aircrews on
   schedule and provide scheduling stability. Two essen-tial elements of this concept are
   realistic determination of SRT(s) based on mission duration and con-scientious management
   by the on-scene commander or DETCO to ensure return of reserve associate aircrews by the
   MET. Except in uncontrollable or unusual circumstances, Reserve associate crewmembers
   must be assured that their missions will be complete within the SRT. The Reserve associate
   AC and MCC will be provided a copy of all mission itinerary changes. Delays in return of
   Reserve associate personnel beyond their SRT will be coordinated through the 552 OG/CC,
   the 513 ACG/CC, and concurred with by the aircrew. Every available means will be used to
   return Reserve associate crewmembers to home station to meet the SRT. If Reserve associate
   aircrew (or members) cannot extend past the SRT, the on-scene commander will verify
   whether military or contract means of trans-portation is available. If no such means are
   available, the on-scene commander or DETCO will use the most expeditious means,
   including commercial air, to return Reserve associate personnel to home station.
3.4. Pre-Mission Duties. The AC in coordination with the MCC and DO/DETCO, may adjust
crew report time to meet mission requirements. Crew report times will allow sufficient time to
accomplish all preflight activities (normally 2+15 hours prior to takeoff). Normally use a 3+30
hour show time prior to takeoff for sorties planned and flown on the same day, unless a Mission
Planning Team (MPT) is utilized. If an MPT is utilized, the SQ/DO or MPT will set the show
time. The FE and technicians (CSO/CT/CDMT/ART) should arrive at the aircraft 1+30 hours
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                            13


prior to the scheduled takeoff time. Crew show at the aircraft for all other crewmembers will
normally be no later than 1 hour prior to the scheduled takeoff time.
   3.4.1. On the day of the mission, aircrew should only be scheduled for duties related to the
   mission, regardless of duty day.
3.5. Minimum Equipment. The 552 OG is the Combat Air Force (CAF) lead for developing
and maintaining the Minimum Equipment List (MEL) for use by all AWACS units. The MEL is
a guide to determine operable equipment required for safe flight. 552 OG will forward a copy of
the MEL to HQ ACC/A3YA, HQ PACAF/A3A, and HQ AFRC/A3T.
3.6. Communications:
   3.6.1. Required Radio Calls. Make the following radio calls to the applicable command post
   or operations center, unless local directives or tactical deception requirements specify
   otherwise:
       3.6.1.1. Maintenance discrepancies which will delay preflight or takeoff (AC).
       3.6.1.2. Engine start time (at least 10 minutes prior to engine start to allow notification of
       Central Security Control (CSC) when appropriate). (AC/CP)
       3.6.1.3. Anytime equipment malfunction or incident occurs that will adversely affect
       mission accomplishment. (AC/MCC)
       3.6.1.4. Actual takeoff time. (Nav)
       3.6.1.5. Significant changes in mission timing. (Nav)
       3.6.1.6. Post-air refueling report. (CSO) (Optional per AC/MCC)
       3.6.1.7. On station/Ops Normal time (NLT 15 minutes after arriving on station). (CSO)
       (Optional per AC/MCC)
       3.6.1.8. Time off station (NLT 15 minutes after departing station). (CSO) (Optional per
       AC/MCC)
       3.6.1.9. Maintenance codes and Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) prior to final landing.
       (CSO)
       3.6.1.10. Revised ETA (if changed by more than 15 minutes) when in UHF radio
       contact. (Nav)
       3.6.1.11. Sortie block time and flight duration. (Nav)
   3.6.2. Maintenance Codes (Aircraft Landing Status and System Capability Codes). The FE
   and each technician will provide the maintenance codes to the CSO prior to landing. Use the
   Aircraft Landing Status and System Capability Codes as defined in AFI 21-101, Aerospace
   Equipment Maintenance Management, and applicable MAJCOM supplements.
3.7. Weapons Controller Assisted/Directed Rendezvous Responsibilities:
   3.7.1. Weapons Controller Assisted Rendezvous. The AWO will provide information to
   assist the Nav in accomplishing the rendezvous and for situational awareness.
   3.7.2. Weapons Controller Directed Rendezvous. The SD is primarily responsible for the
   success of the AWO directed rendezvous. The AWO will brief the flight deck on the A/R
 14                                         AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


   rendezvous procedure to be employed. The AWO will brief rendezvous type, A/R altitude,
   and anticipated turn ranges/direction.
   3.7.3. Communications. Internal coordination between the Nav and AWO during the
   rendezvous will be over Net 1. Other crewmembers will not use Net 1 for 30 minutes before
   the AAR Control Time (ARCT) until after the refueling is complete, unless safety of flight is
   in jeopardy.
   3.7.4. Procedures. The AWO will execute the pre-planned type of rendezvous as coordinated
   with the AC, Nav, and tanker. The AWO will pass bearing, range, and offset of the tanker as
   prebriefed/required. The AC will advise the AWO/MCC when to terminate mission crew
   assistance and when the mission systems may be configured for AAR.
3.8. Radar Radiation Restrictions. Do not radiate the mission radar at or below flight level
(FL) 180 due to the potential for conflict with Visual Flight Rules (VFR) traffic that may pass
closer than 650 feet vertically and 1,300 feet horizontally. However, during contingency
operations, emergency situations, and special operations, the mission radar may be radiating at or
below FL 180 within equipment limitations.
3.9. On-Station Procedures:
   3.9.1. Prior to orbit intercept the Nav will brief the AC and MCC of orbit type, radius,
   present altitude and winds aloft over mission net.
   3.9.2. Fly mission orbits at best endurance indicated airspeed whenever practical but not
   lower than maneuver speed for 30 degrees of bank.
3.10. Aircraft Position Monitoring. Aircraft position relative to a preplanned track is the
responsibility of both the flight and mission crews. Aircraft position and orbit pattern changes
will be coordinated between the MCC, Nav, and AC. The applicable Wing Commander
(WG/CC) may waive the following requirements if deemed necessary to accomplish a specific
mission.
   3.10.1. Flight Crew Procedures:
       3.10.1.1. Pilots will monitor the E-3 position via radio navigational aids and Global
       Positioning System Integrated Navigation System (GINS). The AC will ensure separate
       steering solutions are selected on the AC and CP Control Display Units (CDU).
       3.10.1.2. The Nav, in coordination with the AC, will establish a radio navigation fix or
       line of position between the closest point of the E-3 orbit and the threat area as a ―no fly
       beyond line‖ for all E-3 orbits. This information will be passed to the MCC.
       3.10.1.3. The AC, CP, and Nav positions will be occupied, except for periods of crew
       relief, during flights within 25 NM of an established prohibited area or within 50 NM of a
       potentially hostile border.
       3.10.1.4. When flying in Warning Areas, Military Operating Areas, Restricted Areas, or
       Air Traffic Control (ATC) assigned working areas with other aircraft, the AC and MCC
       are responsible to ensure safe separation between the E-3 and other aircraft
   3.10.2. Mission Crew Procedures:
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                         15


      3.10.2.1. The MCC must have at least a stand-behind position at an operational console
      when a dedicated console is not available.
      3.10.2.2. The AWACS monitor and MCC must maintain awareness of the E-3s position
      and altitude. Their consoles must display the AWACS DATA LINK net participant
      symbol, and they must have a means to determine E-3 altitude for deconfliction purposes.
      If the accuracy of the E-3 symbol is in doubt, consider worst case location, and
      coordinate with the flight deck to take immediate action to reposition the aircraft in order
      to avoid the prohibited/threat areas.
3.11. AWACS Monitor:
   3.11.1. During flight under Due Regard when the mission radar or Identification, Friend or
   Foe (IFF) is operating, the MCC will designate an AWACS monitor to provide traffic
   advisories to the flight crew. At any other time, an AWACS monitor may be utilized as
   determined by the PIC. The AWACS monitor will notify the flight crew and MCC when
   AWACS monitor assumes monitor duties, notify the the MCC when it changes from
   weapons to surveillance (or vice versa), and notify both the flight crew and MCC whenever
   AWACS monitor is terminated. The MCC is ultimately responsible for ensuring that there is
   an AWACS monitor on duty.
   3.11.2. The AWACS monitor will pass track information with the following parameters or
   as modified by the PIC:
      3.11.2.1. For ATC-controlled airspace: Tracks that are within +1,000 feet (IFF Mode C)
      or 3,000 feet radar measured of E-3 altitude and 15 miles from the E-3, if the track is on a
      heading towards the E-3, overtaking, or passing in front of the E-3.
      3.11.2.2. For uncontrolled airspace: Tracks which are within +3,000 feet of E-3 altitude
      and 15 miles from the E-3, if the track is on a heading towards the E-3, overtaking, or
      passing in front of the E-3.
      3.11.2.3. Traffic advisories will include any climbing/descending and/or maneuvering
      aircraft which could pose a threat to the E-3.
   3.11.3. Pass the tracks to the flight crew over Net 1 giving clock position, range, altitude,
   and crossing information about the traffic. If the E-3 is in a turn, pass traffic calls using
   magnetic bearing and range rounded to the nearest 10 degrees. Note: To increase situational
   awareness and promote radio communication deconfliction, AWACS monitor will monitor
   ATC frequency.
3.12. Transportation of Passengers:
   3.12.1. Space-A Passengers. Space-A passengers will not normally fly on the E-3 due to
   mission and training requirements.
   3.12.2. Responsibility. The crewmember(s) designated by the AC to be responsible for
   passengers or distinguished visitors will:
      3.12.2.1. Supervise passenger movement, especially on the flight line.
      3.12.2.2. Assist passengers in locating assigned seats.
      3.12.2.3. Assist in familiarizing passengers with aircraft interior and survival equipment.

      3.12.2.4. Brief all passengers according to AFI 11-202V3 (using Attachment 3 of this
      publication), prior to engine start.
      3.12.2.5. Assist and direct passengers in the event of an aircraft emergency.
   3.12.3. Loading/Off-loading:
      3.12.3.1. When appropriate, engines on the left side of the aircraft can be shutdown and
      an aircrew member will be positioned at the bottom of the steps to direct loading/off-
      loading operations prior to any passengers entering or departing the aircraft.
      3.12.3.2. If only the left engines are shutdown, the TAXI BACK or an approved
      checklist for the given situation may be used.
   3.12.4. Passenger Comfort. Pilots should make every effort to enhance the comfort of
   passengers. Flight operations should be planned for the minimum use of drag devices and
   maneuvers which might cause discomfort or apprehension.
3.13. Debriefings:
   3.13.1. Conduct the maintenance debriefing as soon as practical after engine shutdown. The
   AC, MCC, FE, ART, CDMT, CT, and any crewmember making an entry in the AFTO Form
   781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document, will attend.
   3.13.2. If required, conduct an intelligence debriefing.
   3.13.3. Conduct a crew debriefing.
3.14. Flying Clothing/Equipment:
   3.14.1. All aircrew members will wear or carry the minimum items of clothing and
   equipment according to applicable directives. In addition, all crewmembers will wear flight
   gloves during engine start, takeoffs, landings, and emergencies except where the flight gloves
   hinder completion of required actions.
   3.14.2. It is the responsibility of each crewmember to store/secure their personal and
   professional equipment carried onboard. Keep equipment clear of all entry doors, hatches and
   all emergency equipment during all ground and flight operations. The FE, CSO, and ART
   will ensure that these areas are clear of obstructions during their preflight inspection.
   3.14.3. Crewmembers will not wear lightweight headsets when entering the lower
   compartments.
3.15. Aircraft Security at Enroute Stops/Destination:
   3.15.1. The AC is responsible for ensuring aircraft security at enroute stops. Secure the
   aircraft as a Protection Level 2 resource IAW AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation
   Security Program, as supplemented by MAJCOM. This requires a US entry controller (at
   least one per every two aircraft) and restricted access. Provide a copy of the flight orders and
   passenger manifest (as applicable) to the entry controller as a way to identify persons
   authorized entry to the aircraft as well as those crewmembers designated by the AC to have
   escort privileges. Perimeter patrol can be accomplished by host nation security, but the entry
   controller must be US security personnel or a US E-3 crewmember. In addition, equipment
   classified as SECRET (that cannot be removed from the aircraft) must be safe-guarded by US
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                          17


   security personnel or a US E-3 crewmember. Only the AC may release security forces from
   guarding the aircraft. Waiver authority is the appropriate WG/CC.
   3.15.2. The MCC is responsible for the security of classified mission documents and
   software. While deployed or during enroute stops, COMSEC and software can be stored on
   the aircraft when U.S. security personnel are used as the entry controller. In the event of a
   stop at a location where no U.S. security personnel are available, COMSEC will be stored in
   the Command Post or the MCC will designate crewmember(s) to remain with the software
   and COMSEC to provide security.
3.16. Personal Publications Requirements. Personal Publications Requirements. Local units
will issue each crewmember publications IAW AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program as
supplemented. See local supplement to this publication for requirements listing.
3.17. Aircraft Recall/Diversion. Unless received over secure communications, challenge any
recall or diversion of an E-3 using the appropriate authentication for the theater of operation. P-
sorties do not require authentication.
3.18. Transition Training:
   3.18.1. Do not conduct transition when scheduled takeoff or final landing is between 2400L
   and 0600L without SQ/DO approval.
   3.18.2. When performing transition with mission crew on board, the total transition time will
   not exceed 2+30 hours. However, do not conduct more than 1+30 hours at one time without
   SQ/DO approval.
   3.18.3. Aircrews may conduct off-station transition if airfield was included in the mission
   planning conducted prior to flight and approval was obtained by SQ/DO (or higher
   authority).
       3.18.3.1. Aircrew may ―drop-in‖ to airfields designated as ―familiar‖ in local
       supplements without pre-flight mission planning/approval. The PIC will ensure current
       NOTAMS are reviewed, be familiar with the airfield, and coordinate with SQ/DO (or
       higher authority) prior to commencing descent to the airfield.
   3.18.4. Transition duty day is a period of 12 hours that starts and runs concurrently with the
   maximum flight duty periods and applies to all flight crewmembers. Transition may be
   accomplished with additional crewmembers onboard who have exceeded transition duty day
   provided they are not occupying their primary flight crew duty position or performing flight
   crew instructor or Stan Eval Flight Examiner (SEFE) duties.
       3.18.4.1. The OG/CC can approve requests to extend transition duty day to 16 hours. 513
       ACG may perform transition training on local training missions provided duty day does
       not exceed 16 hours and actual flying time does not exceed 12 hours.
3.19. Crew Coordination Drills. Thoroughly plan, brief and practice simulated crew
coordination drills (i.e. Ditching, Crash Landing, Loss of Pressurization, Nuclear Event, Smoke
or Fumes, and Fuselage Fire drills) during each training sortie when mission profile allows. The
following procedures apply:
   3.19.1. The AC and MCC will coordinate prior to initiation, and make every effort to inform
   all instructors and evaluators of crew coordination drill timing in order to maximize training.
 18                                          AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


   3.19.2. Operational requirements will not be interrupted.
   3.19.3. Doors and hatches will not be opened and equipment will not be powered down.
   However, if a simulated crew coordination drill is performed after calling ―off station,‖ a
   normal equipment power down may be incorporated into the drill in anticipation of landing
   the aircraft.
   3.19.4. If passengers are onboard during the drill, passengers will be briefed but will not
   participate.
   3.19.5. The AC will make a Public Address (PA) announcement at the start of the crew
   coordination drill vulnerability period and at the conclusion of the drill.
3.20. Aircraft Cleanliness. It is the AC and MCC‘s responsibility to ensure the aircraft is clean
and orderly after a mission. All crewmembers are responsible for removing or stowing their
personal and professional items prior to departing the aircraft.
3.21. Aircraft Configuration for Static Display. Whenever an E-3 is on static display and
opened for viewing, there will be a passenger stand at each open door. Hatches will only be
opened when an aircrew member is positioned at the hatch. ACs will ensure proper
safety/security precautions are taken to protect the aircraft, passengers and crew. Command
instructions concerning participation in static displays and aerial events provide further guidance.
3.22. Readiness Postures.
   3.22.1. Types of Alert.
       3.22.1.1. Readiness Posture One (RP-1) denotes an aircraft and crew capable of
       launching in 1 hour from notification. Crews designated for RP-1 alert duty should
       normally be housed in a designated alert facility. 12 hours of pre-alert crew rest is
       required prior to assuming RP-1 alert.
       3.22.1.2. Readiness Posture Three (RP-3) denotes an aircraft and crew capable of
       launching in 3 hours from notification. 12 hours of pre-alert crew rest is required prior to
       assuming RP-3 alert.
       3.22.1.3. Readiness Posture Fifteen (RP-15) denotes an aircraft and crew capable of
       launching 15 hours after notification. The RP-15 crew will be present for normal duty
       each day and carry pagers and/or cell phones for notification. Crew rest begins after
       notification.
   3.22.2. Maximum flight duty period for RP-1, RP-3, and RP-15 crews. Maximum flight
   duty period for RP-1 and RP-3 crews is 12 hours. RP-1/RP-3 flight duty period extensions
   will be IAW MAJCOM Supplement to AFI 11-202V3. Maximum flight duty period for RP-
   15 crews is 12 hours. RP-15 flight duty period extension to 16 hours is waiverable by the
   OG/CC based on ORM and mission analysis.
   3.22.3. Alert duty scheduling, flight duty on alert, and maximum number of days on alert
   will be IAW MAJCOM Sup to AFI 11-202V3.
   3.22.4. Post-Alert Compensation Time.
       3.22.4.1. If alert duty is performed away from normal quarters (e.g. alert facility or
       billeting) for a period of 96 hours or more, compensation time off will be 1 day for every
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                               19


     4 days on alert duty, unless waived by the applicable group commander or designated
     representative.
     3.22.4.2. No compensatory time is authorized if alert duty was performed in normal
     quarters.

                      FLIGHT CREW OPERATING PROCEDURES

4.1. Adverse Weather.
   4.1.1. Icing Restrictions. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe icing is prohibited.
   Prolonged operation, such as cruise flight or holding, in areas of moderate icing should be
   avoided. Note: Air Force Weather Agency technical notice AFWA/TN 98/002,
   Meteorological Techniques, states that freezing drizzle is equivalent to moderate icing and
   freezing rain is equivalent to severe icing. When freezing fog is forecast or reported, aircrew
   will confirm with the local weather agency what type of icing is associated with the freezing
   fog.
      4.1.1.1. Do not takeoff under conditions of freezing rain or freezing drizzle.
      4.1.1.2. Freezing/frozen precipitation (freezing rain, drizzle, snow, fog, or temperatures
      near 0o C, etc.) may cause ice or frost to accumulate on aircraft surfaces. When an aircraft
      requires deicing/anti-icing prior to takeoff, refer to the following:
          4.1.1.2.1. Flight crew will be familiar with and follow all procedures and restrictions
          in T.O. 1E-3A-1, Flight Manual and T.O. 1E-3A-1-1, Performance Manual, with
          respect to de-ice/anti-ice procedures. Further guidance is provided in T.O. 42C-1-2,
          Aircraft Anti-icing Procedures.
          4.1.1.2.2. MIL-A-8243 Type I and Type II de-icing fluids do not provide any anti-
          icing benefit, and therefore do not have holdover times. As a guide, for approved anti-
          icing fluids, crews may use published anti-icing holdover times IAW T.O. 42C-1-2
          and AFFSA (FAA) holdover tables located at the HQ AFFSA website. The holdover
          time begins when anti-icing fluid is first applied and is affected by intensity/type of
          precipitation, time, temperature, and type/dilution of mixture. PIC shall use this
          information to determine when holdover time is exceeded and re-apply fluid if
          required.
          4.1.1.2.3. The PIC will ensure the following information (4-element code) is received
          from the deicing ground crew after anti-icing is complete:
              4.1.1.2.3.1. Element A. Element A specifies the type of anti-icing fluid (e.g.
              Type IV).
              4.1.1.2.3.2. Element B. Element B specifies the percentage of fluid within the
              fluid/water mixture (e.g. 75/25 is 75% fluid and 25% water).
              4.1.1.2.3.3. Element C. Element C specifies the time of the beginning of the
              anti-icing step. All holdover times are based on this value. All times are based on
              Local (L) time.
              4.1.1.2.3.4. Element D. Element D specifies the date (day, written month, year).
              The date will be consistent with local time.
          4.1.1.2.4. In all cases, PICs will ensure a visual inspection is completed within 5
          minutes of departure.
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                        21


   4.1.2. Turbulence Restrictions. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence
   is prohibited. Every effort will be made to avoid areas of reported moderate turbulence. If
   moderate turbulence is forecast along the planned route of flight, the AC will coordinate with
   weather personnel as to the best course of action to vacate the condition, if encountered.
      4.1.2.1. Crews should confirm type of aircraft the forecast turbulence applies to, or what
      type of aircraft reported the encounter, to gain a more accurate picture for their route of
      flight.
      4.1.2.2. The PIC is responsible for ensuring all aircrew/passengers are seated, with seat
      belts fastened, when areas of moderate or greater turbulence are encountered or
      anticipated. Warning: Serious injury may occur if aircrew/passengers do not have their
      seat belts fastened and the aircraft encounters moderate or severe turbulence.
   4.1.3. Thunderstorm Avoidance. Pilots will neither file a flight plan nor fly into an area of
   known or forecasted thunderstorm activity when the weather radar is inoperative or unusable
   and thunderstorm activity cannot be visually circumnavigated. During flight, avoid
   thunderstorms by at least:
      4.1.3.1. 20 NM at or above FL 230.
      4.1.3.2. 10 NM below FL 230.
      4.1.3.3. In the vicinity of the airport, maintain at least 5 NM separation from heavy rain
      showers. Note: Approaches or departures may be authorized by the appropriate group
      commander if thunderstorms are officially observed to be closer than 10 NM (but not less
      than 5 NM) from the airport. IAW AFI 11-202V3, the thunderstorm must not be
      producing any hazardous conditions (such as hail, lightning, strong winds, gust fronts,
      heavy rain, wind shear, or microburst) at the airport, and must not be forecast or observed
      to be moving in the direction of the route of flight (to include the planned missed
      approach corridor, if applicable).
   4.1.4. Lightning Avoidance. The following conditions are most conducive to lightning
   strikes and prolonged flight in them should be avoided:
      4.1.4.1. Within ± 8oC or ± 5,000 feet of the freezing level.
      4.1.4.2. In clouds or in any intensity of precipitation or turbulence associated with
      thunderstorm activity.
   4.1.5. Temperature Correction. For all flight operations, temperature corrections to
   published altitudes shall be applied IAW AFI 11-202V3 and the chart provided in the Flight
   Information Handbook (FIH) to ensure adequate obstacle clearance.
4.2. Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD)/Restrictions:
   4.2.1. A flight engineer will compute all initial takeoff and landing data during mission
   planning utilizing an authorized TOLD computer program or T.O. 1E-3A-1-1, Flight Manual
   Performance Data – E-3B, E-3C. A pilot will crosscheck this data using the computer
   program or T.O. 1E-3A-1-1. Either the initial computation or crosscheck of TOLD data will
   be done using the T.O. 1E-3A-1-1.
      4.2.1.1. The applicable group commander may authorize use of Misson Accomplishment
      Planning Methods, IAW T.O. 1E-3A-1-1, when operational/contingency missions dictate.
22                                        AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


  4.2.2. Rolling Takeoffs. Rolling takeoffs are authorized (and with a crosswind component
  above 20 knots required) IAW T.O. 1E-3A-1, Flight Manual, E-3B & E-3C Aircraft. Make
  rolling takeoffs whenever appropriate.
  4.2.3. Reduced Power Takeoffs. The following information is provided in addition to that
  found in T.O. 1E-3A-1-1:
     4.2.3.1. Whenever practical, a reduced power takeoff should be made.
     4.2.3.2. Actual inboard takeoff rated thrust (TRT) will be displayed on the inboard
     exhaust pressure ratio (EPR) bugs for quick reference in the event TRT is required.
     4.2.3.3. For all reduced thrust takeoffs, 1,000 feet or more will be subtracted from
     runway available to compute all data except refusal speed.
     4.2.3.4. Reduced thrust takeoffs may be accomplished on a wet runway provided the
     runway is free of snow, ice, and slush.
     4.2.3.5. Reduced thrust takeoffs are permitted with falling precipitation provided
     precipitation is not moderate to heavy.
  4.2.4. Tailwind Takeoffs. Tailwind takeoffs are not recommended and normally should not
  be planned or accomplished. If operational necessity or ATC considerations dictate
  acceptance of a tailwind condition, a maximum component of 10 knots may exist provided
  data does not exceed allowable T.O. 1E-3A-1-1 limits.
  4.2.5. Crosswind:
     4.2.5.1. Unless further restricted by aircraft gross weight or emergency conditions, the
     maximum crosswind component (gust included) for takeoff and landing with RCR 26/23
     is 25 knots, RCR 15 is 20 knots, RCR 10 is 15 knots. If RCR falls between the above
     RCR values, use next lower RCR restrictions. Operation at higher crosswind values
     requires specific approval by applicable group commander.
     4.2.5.2. Copilots are limited to a maximum takeoff/landing component of 15 knots
     unless under IP/SEFE supervision.
  4.2.6. Runway and Taxiway. IAW MAJCOM directives, minimum runway length and
  width for takeoff or landing is 7,000 x 135 feet unless waived by OG/CC. Minimum taxiway
  width is 75 feet unless waived by OG/CC.
     4.2.6.1. Aircraft will normally takeoff and land on the longest suitable runway available.
     4.2.6.2. Intersection takeoffs are not recommended and will not be performed unless
     operational necessity dictates. In such a situation, follow MAJCOM directives.
  4.2.7. Runway Condition Reading (RCR). Aircraft will not takeoff or land when reported
  RCR is less than 10. The applicable OG/CC has the authority to waiver the minimum RCR to
  7 when operational necessity warrants. Do not conduct aircraft ground operations to include
  taxi and towing with a RCR less than 7.
  4.2.8. Noise Abatement. IAW T.O. 1E-3A-1 and T.O. 1E-3A-1-1 guidance. An engine
  failure or other emergency condition during takeoff is a non-normal condition and takes
  precedence over published noise abatement procedures.
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                         23


   4.2.9. Landings. Except in emergency situations, the following apply:
       4.2.9.1. Computed landing distance plus 1,000 feet must not exceed runway available.
       4.2.9.2. Full stop landings with less than 40 degrees of flaps are not permitted.
       4.2.9.3. If it appears that the actual touchdown will occur beyond the first 1/3 or 3,000
       feet (whichever is less) of the runway length, pilots will go-around.
       4.2.9.4. Make no more than one full stop in a 30 minute period. When performing taxi
       back type operations and/or multiple full stop landings, observe brake limitations and
       cooling procedures IAW T.O. 1E-3A-1 and T.O. 1E-3A-1-1.
   4.2.10. Missed Approach. Prior to starting an instrument approach, the AC will ensure
   performance complies with missed approach climb gradient requirements IAW AFI 11-
   202V3. For planning purposes, base performance on the expected go-around configuration.
4.3. Takeoff and Landing Policy:
   4.3.1. Aircraft Commander Responsibilities.
       4.3.1.1. A qualified AC will make all takeoffs and landings from the left seat when either
       of the following conditions exist:
           4.3.1.1.1. When weather is below 300‘ ceiling and 1 statute mile (SM) visibility.
           4.3.1.1.2. A distinguished visitor (Code 4, Code 4 equivalent, or higher) is on board
           as a passenger.
NOTE:
 IPs may takeoff or land in either seat under the conditions above; however, a copilot will not
occupy the left seat.
       4.3.1.2. ACs must be certified as ―experienced‖ in order to accomplish the following
       activities:
           4.3.1.2.1. Supervise an ―experienced‖ CP during simulated engine-out maneuvers
           (approach, missed approach, or full stop landing).
   4.3.2. Copilot Takeoffs and Landings.
       4.3.2.1. Copilots may perform takeoff and landings if the weather is at least 300-feet
       ceiling and 1 SM visibility, or published minimums, whichever is higher.
       4.3.2.2. During takeoffs and landings CPs must be properly supervised by an IP/SEFE or
       certified AC.
       4.3.2.3. CPs must be certified by the SQ/CC as ―experienced‖ in order to accomplish the
       following activities:
           4.3.2.3.1. Takeoff and land under the supervision of a certified AC with passengers
           onboard (no DVs Code 4 or higher).
           4.3.2.3.2. Perform simulated engine-out maneuvers (approach, missed approach, or
           full stop landing) under the supervision of an ―experienced‖ AC.
4.4. Preflight.
 24                                           AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


   4.4.1. Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) will normally be enabled at all
   times.
   4.4.2. AUTONAV will normally be enabled for INU ground alignment.
   4.4.3. To comfirm proper INU alignment, the Nav will check the INU true headings prior to
   engine start and confirm they are within 1 degree of each other and cross-checked with the
   Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS).
4.5. Engine Start/Taxi:
   4.5.1. When using a motorized staircase vehicle (Very Importatnt Person (VIP) Stand or
   ―Air Stairs‖), aircrews will close entry doors prior to the removal or placement of the stands.
   4.5.2. The occupants of both pilot seats will have their seat belt fastened while taxiing and
   will also wear their shoulder harness during critical phases of flight.
   4.5.3. Taxi speed in the parking area or any congested area will be slow enough to
   accommodate a wing walker.
   4.5.4. The navigator will monitor GINS ground speed during taxi operations.
   4.5.5. The navigator will use the weather radar to scan the departure path prior to takeoff to
   avoid flying into areas of heavy precipitation and/or possible associated turbulence.
   4.5.6. At the hammerhead, flight crews will verify the accuracy of the GINS position.
4.6. Frequency Monitoring. The AC, CP, Nav, and FE will monitor the briefed primary radio
frequency during all phases of flight unless directed otherwise by the AC. The AC will ensure
VHF guard (if available), UHF guard, and mission interphone are monitored at all times. During
critical phases of flight and during periods of high pilot workloads, pilots should monitor only
the frequency required for flight operations (tower, departure, approach etc.). C2 or other
frequencies to be monitored will be designated by the AC. The observer‘s seat occupant will be
briefed on the relationship between the AC‘s Audio Distribution System (ADS) and the
observer‘s interphone to prevent extraneous radio transmissions.
4.7. Altitude Monitoring. When climbing or descending, the pilot not flying or the navigator
will call 1,000 feet above/below and approaching level off (within 200 ft) altitude. While
operating at less than 2,000 feet above the ground, the pilot not flying the aircraft will inform the
pilot at the controls anytime the indicated altitude varies more than 100 feet from the desired
altitude, or if the aircraft appears to be dangerously close to terrain or obstructions. The navigator
will back up the pilots in observing and reporting these deviations.
4.8. Departure.
   4.8.1. Departure Planning. Use AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217V1, Instrument Flight
   Procedures, this chapter, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplements. During mission
   planning, the flight crew will determine a gross weight that ensures E-3 performance will
   meet or exceed departure requirements. Note: In the event E-3 performance is unable to meet
   the published climb gradient at the desired gross weight, down load fuel, use other applicable
   approved methods described below, or delay until more favorable conditions exist.
   4.8.2. All Engines Operating (AEO). The E-3 will meet or exceed the published climb
   gradient or 200 ft/nm, which ever is higher, for the departure runway.
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                           25


   4.8.3. One Engine Inoperative (OEI). The E-3 will meet or exceed the published climb
   gradient or 200 ft/nm, whichever is higher. Other methods, IAW AFI 11-202V3 and
   applicable MAJCOM supplements, may be used.
      4.8.3.1. Special Departure Procedure (SDP). SDPs are authorized and available for the
      E-3. E-3 SDPs are MDS-specific OEI escape procedures intended only for emergency
      use after the loss of an engine. SDPs clear applicable screen heights and all obstacles
      along the defined escape flight path. Retrieve current E-3 SDPs from the Jeppesen AF
      Opsdata                                                                        website
      http://www.jeppesen.com/wlcs/index.jsp?section=gms&content=gms_home.jsp. User
      ID and password are available from 552 OG/OGV upon training completion.
          4.8.3.1.1. Ad hoc‘ requests for fields not currently listed may be requested through
          applicable OGV NLT 72 hours prior to scheduled departure. ‗Ad hoc‘ SDPs are valid
          for seven (7) days after the analysis date. The SDP analysis date is located in the
          upper left-hand corner of the takeoff performance sheet.
      4.8.3.2. Vertically Clear all Obstacles. If crews are unable to meet 200 ft/nm or required
      published climb gradient and an SDP is not available, crews may subtract 48 ft/nm from
      the published climb gradient IAW applicable MAJCOM supplements, to approximate
      zero foot obstacle clearance. Minimum climb gradients may be published as ‗Trouble T‘
      restrictions in the IFR takeoff Minimums section of Flight Information Publications
      (FLIP) or on a standard instrument departure (SID). Other methods are available but may
      be restricted based on MAJCOM directives or guidance.
   4.8.4. Screen Heights (SH). Required SHs are, in essence, obstacles and will be treated as
   such for performance calculations. Flight crew will ensure the calculated CFL allows the E-3
   to cross the departure end of runway at or above the required SH. SH height requirements for
   departures depend on the agency that wrote the departure and/or the airfield where the
   departure is being flown. Reference FLIP, AFMAN 11-217V1, and where available, the SDP
   performance page.
   4.8.5. Published low close-in obstacles. Climb gradients do not take into account ―published
   low close-in obstacles‖ (obstacles or terrain 200‘ Above Ground Level (AGL) and below
   within one nautical mile from departure end of runway). These obstacles should normally be
   published as a NOTE on the SID or IFR departure procedure (Trouble T). The AC will
   ensure all applicable published low close-in obstacles along the departure flight path will be
   safely cleared. Crews should exercise caution when determining not to consider a published
   low close-in obstacle and realize there are factors that could result in a greater deviation from
   intended track centerline (i.e. high crosswinds, low ceiling/visibility, etc.). Note: Distance to
   published low close-in obstacles includes unused runway past CFL.
4.9. Enroute Navigation:
   4.9.1. Normally plan for maximum use of E-3 navigation equipment by flying great circle
   routes. Random Area Navigation (RNAV)/direct routing may be flown according to FLIP,
   General Planning. Navigators will annotate changes to the route of flight on the Navigational
   chart (unless safety of flight dictates). Revised ETA‘s will be computed and the ETA to
   significant events will be briefed to the AC and MCC. Any waypoints or patterns entered into
   the navigation system will be crosschecked by an additional flight crew member.
26                                         AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


  4.9.2. The navigator will accomplish periodic crosschecks of navigation equipment, intended
  route, and cleared route to identify navigation errors, prevent inadvertent deviations and
  ensure the equipment is performing within tolerances. This crosscheck will additionally be
  performed: after level-off, prior to air refueling, prior to orbit intercept, and when assuming
  station. The AC (and MCC as required) will be immediately notified of any
  discrepancies/malfunctions.
  4.9.3. Special Qualification Airspace Navigation. Both Required Navigation Performance
  (RNP) Airspace and Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace are
  considered special qualification airspace. These airspace requires aircrew certification. The
  E-3 is approved for operation in RNP airspace with operational limitations based on GINS
  navigational equipment. Integrated DAMA/GATM (IDG) equipped E-3s are approved for
  operation in RVSM airspace. Reference FLIP GP and the following guidance for RNP and
  RVSM requirements.
     4.9.3.1. RNP-10 compliance includes navigation accuracy within 10 NM of actual
     position 95 percent of the time.
         4.9.3.1.1. The E-3 may operate in RNP-10 airspace without time limits when ―GPS-
         only‖ or ―GPS/INS-blended‖ mode of navigation is selected. The E-3 may operate in
         RNP-10 airspace in ―INS-only‖ mode for 6.2 hours from the time the Embedded GPS
         INUs (EGIs) were commanded to the NAV mode or the last aligned, whichever is
         later.
         4.9.3.1.2. Updates will be IAW RNP/Basic Area Navigation (BRNAV) update and
         contingency procedures in this volume.
  4.9.4. BRNAV (RNP-5) Airspace. Compliance includes navigation accuracy within 5 NM of
  actual position 95 percent of the time. BRNAV accuracy criteria is RNP-5.
     4.9.4.1. The E-3 may operate in BRNAV (RNP-5) airspace without time limits when
     ―GPS-only‖ or ―GPS/INS-blended‖ mode of navigation is selected. The E-3 may be
     operated in BRNAV/RNP-5 airspace in ―INS-only‖ mode for 2.0 hours from the time the
     EGIs were commanded to the NAV mode or the last aligned, whichever is later.
  4.9.5. RNP/BRNAV Flight Planning. The PIC will review airspace requirements (i.e.
  specific RNP level and contingency actions, etc.) and assess mission impact when flying in
  RNP-10/BRNAV (RNP-5) airspace.
     4.9.5.1. Enroute. At the RNP/BRNAV entry point both EGIs must be operational and
     RAIM must be ON and operational. Periodic crosschecks of all available navigation
     sources, intended route, and cleared route will be accomplished to identify navigation
     errors and prevent inadvertent deviation from ATC cleared routes. Advise ATC of the
     deterioration or failure of navigation equipment below navigation performance
     requirements and coordinate appropriate actions.
  4.9.6. Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace. Airspace where RVSM is
  applied is considered special qualification airspace. Both the aircrew and the specific aircraft
  must be approved for operations in these areas. E-3s ―with IDG‖ aircraft are approved for
  unrestricted use in the full RVSM envelope. Refer to FLIP GP and the following guidance
  for RVSM requirements:
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                        27


      4.9.6.1. RVSM Equipment. Both primary altimeters, the autopilot (to include the altitude
      hold function), the altitude alerter system, and the IFF transponder must be fully
      operational before entry into RVSM airspace. Before entering RVSM airspace advise
      ATC of any RVSM equipment failures and request a new clearance.
          4.9.6.1.1. Autopilot. The autopilot shall be engaged during level cruise except when
          circumstances such as the need to re-trim the aircraft require disengagement.
          4.9.6.1.2. Altimeters. Crosscheck the altimeters (STBY to RESET) before or
          immediately upon entry to RVSM airspace.
          4.9.6.1.3. Should any of the required equipment fail after entry into RVSM airspace,
          immediately notify ATC and coordinate a plan of action.
      4.9.6.2. RVSM Operations. Continuously monitor systems and crosscheck altimeters to
      ensure they agree ± 200 ft.
          4.9.6.2.1. Aircrews should limit climb and descent rates to 1,000 feet per minute
          when operating in the vicinity of other aircraft to reduce potential effects on traffic
          collision avoidance system (TCAS) operations.
   4.9.7. Trans-oceanic flights. To minimize trans-oceanic gross navigational errors (GNE),
   Navs will accomplish a coast out/in fix during trans-oceanic flights or when the aircraft is
   operating out of radio aid range. For trans-oceanic flights navigators will compute an equal
   time point (ETP). Additionally, the Nav will annotate the time over an oceanic checkpoint on
   the Navigational chart. The aircraft heading will be crosschecked with the planned heading.
   The Nav will annotate the aircraft position on the navigational chart approximately 10
   minutes after each oceanic waypoint is passed.
4.10. On-Station:
   4.10.1. The CSO will normally control the use of HF 1. The AC will coordinate with the
   CSO if the flight crew requires its use. The MCC/CSO will coordinate with the AC if the
   mission crew requires the use of either of the flight crew‘s VHF or UHF radios.
   4.10.2. Pilots and navigators will closely monitor the first complete trip around the orbit
   after initial intercept to ensure the aircraft is maintaining proper orbit.
   4.10.3. The AC has the responsibility and final authority for determining when the aircraft
   should depart station. ACs will consider forecast enroute and destination weather, enroute
   winds, icing, mission requirements, fuel requirements, training requirements, etc.
      4.10.3.1. Within 1 hour after assuming station or refueling, the flight crew will compute
      ―bingo fuel‖ and report remaining station time to the MCC. If AAR is planned after orbit,
      make a similar computation allowing enough fuel so that in the event of a missed AAR,
      the aircraft can land at the destination or a preplanned alternate with the required fuel
      minimums. Bingo fuel computations will not include center wing tank fuel used as ballast
      to maintain center of gravity (c.g.) forward of 35% mean aerodynamic chord (MAC).
      4.10.3.2. If fuel requirements necessitate a modification to on-station duration, pattern,
      or altitude, the AC will notify the MCC.
      4.10.3.3. Make a weather check no later than 2 hours prior to estimated time of departure
      (ETD) from the orbit area (or prior to ETA if enroute). This check will include enroute,
 28                                          AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


      refueling track, landing base, and alternate base (if required) weather. Crews will use all
      available weather sources to keep abreast of changes.
      4.10.3.4. Crews should fly an alternate mission in lieu of dumping fuel to adjust gross
      weight should an equipment malfunction or an inability to complete an assigned mission
      occur. Alternate missions should be planned and briefed during mission planning day.
4.11. Arrival and Approach:
   4.11.1. Approach Briefing. Prior to starting descent from cruise altitude, the pilot flying the
   approach will brief the crew IAW T.O. 1E-3A-1 and AFMAN 11-217V1 requirements.
   During an approach, the AC, CP or FP, and Nav will each have a separate Terminal
   Approach Procedure or Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR) booklet available for use
   during the descent briefing and to reference during the approach. The pilot not flying the
   approach and the Nav will monitor their respective instruments and all radio transmissions by
   the controlling agency, and advise the pilot making the approach when noting any deviation
   from the prescribed procedures or instructions.
   4.11.2. Instrument Approach Advisory Calls. The pilot monitoring the approach will make
   the following advisory calls:
      4.11.2.1. Non-Precision Approaches:
          4.11.2.1.1. 100 feet above minimum descent altitude (MDA).
          4.11.2.1.2. ―Minimums‖ at MDA.
          4.11.2.1.3. ―Runway in sight.‖ Make this call when the runway environment is in
          sight. Do not call too soon when obstructions to vision such as fog, haze, low stratus
          clouds, etc., are present.
          4.11.2.1.4. ―Visual descent point (VDP).‖
          4.11.2.1.5. ―Missed Approach Point,‖ (MAP), if applicable.
      4.11.2.2. Precision Approaches:
          4.11.2.2.1. 100 feet above decision height (DH).
          4.11.2.2.2. ―Runway in sight.‖ Make this call when the runway environment is in
          sight. Do not call too soon when obstructions to vision such as fog, haze, low stratus
          clouds, etc., are present.
          4.11.2.2.3. ―Decision height.‖
      4.11.2.3. The navigator will monitor altitude and report deviations.
      4.11.2.4. The pilot flying the aircraft will:
          4.11.2.4.1. Acknowledge all advisory calls over interphone.
          4.11.2.4.2. Announce intentions over interphone at the appropriate decision point for
          both instrument and visual approaches (i.e. ―Crew we‘re going to land/go-
          around/touch-and-go‖).
   4.11.3. Priorities. Upon commencing the final approach (glideslope interception or departing
   the final approach fix [FAF]), flight deck crewmembers will avoid unnecessary distractions.
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                            29


   Priorities will be monitoring the approach/landing and completing the BEFORE LANDING
   checklist. All activities not associated with the approach/landing checklist accomplishment
   will cease.
4.12. Touch-and-Go Landings. Accomplish touch-and-go landings under the following
conditions:
   4.12.1. IP/SEFE supervision.
   4.12.2. Minimum weather required is 300‘ ceiling and 1 SM visibility.
   4.12.3. Crosswind component does not exceed the following (including gusts): Dry runway--
   15 knots; wet runway--10 knots.
   4.12.4. No passengers on board.
      4.12.4.1. The following are not considered passengers for this restriction: Wing
      supervisors, E-3 maintenance personnel, AFA/AFROTC cadets, FAA/ATC personnel,
      weapons directors, ACC TRSS Detachment 6 personnel not on aeronautical orders,
      Airborne Command Element (ACE) team members, mission essential ground personnel
      (MEGP), Security Forces, Intelligence personnel, and US customs personnel flying under
      the provisions of AFI 11-401 and MAJCOM supplement.
      4.12.4.2. The following are not considered passengers for this restriction with applicable
      group commander approval prior to takeoff: military members not on aeronautical orders
      who are awaiting training, Computer Support Group (CSG) personnel conducting inflight
      software testing, and Mission Crew Training (MCT) and Flight Crew Training (FCT)
      contract instructors in direct support of training and operations.
   4.12.5. The following length/width criteria apply: Dry runway--9,000 feet x 135 feet
   minimum; wet runway--10,000 feet x 135 feet minimum. On a wet runway, touchdown in the
   first 2,000 feet of the runway or initiate a go-around.
   4.12.6. On wet runways, conduct touch-and-go landings at flaps 50 degrees only. On wet
   runways, display the actual charted go-around EPR on the inboard EPR ―bugs‖ for quick
   reference in the event go-around EPR is required while airborne. Outboard EPR ―bugs‖
   should display 1.50 EPR. Wet runway touch-and-go landings are permitted with falling
   precipitation (i.e., drizzle or light rain), pro-vided the precipitation is not moderate to heavy,
   not producing a runway surface condition (RSC), and it can be determined that water is not
   pooling on the runway.
   4.12.7. Runway is free of all snow, ice, and slush. This does not preclude touch-and-go
   landings provided the RCR is reported as 10 or higher. The 962 AACS will use the following
   procedures: landing surface (67.5 feet left and right of centerline) is completely clear of slush
   and the minimum RCR reading for any portion of the runway is 10.
4.13. Inflight Simulated Emergency/Engine-Out Procedures:
   4.13.1. Inflight, prior to simulated emergency procedures, the IP/AC must alert all
   crewmembers in the cockpit.
   4.13.2. In an actual emergency, all student pilot/copilot training and simulated emergency
   procedures will be terminated. Training will resume only when the AC has determined that
   no hazard to safe aircraft operation exists.
 30                                          AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


   4.13.3. Except for simulated engine-out landings, restore all aircraft systems to normal
   operation prior to landing.
   4.13.4. IP/SEFE supervision is required for all touch-and-go‘s, flaps 14, flaps 25, and flaps
   25 to 50 approaches/landing. Prior to performing a flaps 14 approach/landing, update the
   brake energy limited landing weight and landing distance limited landing weight and brief
   differences to normal configuration habit patterns, emphasizing gear lowering sequence.
   4.13.5. Simulated engine-out maneuver restrictions (inflight) :
      4.13.5.1. Simulated engine-out takeoffs are prohibited.
      4.13.5.2. Simulated two-engine operations are prohibited.
      4.13.5.3. Do not accomplish actual engine shutdown inflight. A reduction in thrust can
      adequately simulate training in aircraft control procedures.
      4.13.5.4. Limit all inflight simulated engine-out activity to a gross weight of 270,000 lbs
      or less, with rudder boost on.
      4.13.5.5. Pilots performing simulated engine-out touch-and-gos will follow normal four-
      engine takeoff procedures.
      4.13.5.6. No passengers on board. Do not consider Flight Crew Training (FCT) contract
      instructors in direct support of training and operations as passengers for this restriction.
      4.13.5.7. ACs/FPs/CPs certified to do so by their SQ/CC, may accomplish simulated
      engine-out missed approaches, go-arounds, and full-stop landings in VMC (day or night)
      without IP/SEFE supervision.
      4.13.5.8. All planned simulated engine-out missed approaches/go-arounds will be
      initiated no lower than 200 feet height above touchdown.
      4.13.5.9. During a simulated engine-out approach, if an unplanned go-around or missed
      approach is executed, establish symmetrical thrust on all engines when safe and practical.
4.14. Landing Attitude Demonstrations. Landing attitude demonstrations may only be
accomplished by IP/SEFE‘s or ACs under IP/SEFE supervision. The following restrictions
apply:
   4.14.1. Must be accomplished four engine only.
   4.14.2. Dry runway only.
   4.14.3. Flaps 40 or 50 only.
   4.14.4. Normal dry runway touch-and-go conditions and restrictions apply.
   4.14.5. Go-around will be initiated if aircraft touches down during the initial roundout.
   4.14.6. Go-around will be initiated with no less than 4,000 feet of runway remaining.
4.15. Simulator Only Maneuvers. The following maneuvers will be practiced in the flight
simulator only:
   4.15.1. Aborted takeoff.
   4.15.2. Engine failure(s) during takeoff and/or climbout to traffic pattern altitude.
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                          31


   4.15.3. Two-engine operations (cruise, approach, go-around, and/or landing).
   4.15.4. Three-engine rudder boost out operations (cruise, approach, go-around, and/or
   landing).
   4.15.5. Initial Buffet/Stick Shaker Recovery.
   4.15.6. Unusual Attitudes.
   4.15.7. Flaps-up landing and touch and go.
4.16. Occupancy of Flight Crew Duty Positions:
   4.16.1. ACs and FPs may perform their duties from either seat. CPs must be certified by the
   SQ/CC in order to perform duties in the AC position during critical phases of flight and then
   may do so only under IP/SEFE supervision.
   4.16.2. During non-critical phases of flight, if the AC or CP leaves the flight deck, the FE
   position must be occupied by a qualified FE or be supervised by an instructor/SEFE FE.
   4.16.3. During critical phases of flight or simulated/actual emergencies, unqualified pilots or
   pilots not in training to achieve qualification in the E-3, will not occupy any flight crew duty
   position. Rated pilot General/Flag officers flying under provisions of MAJCOM guidance are
   exempt. Waiver authority is MAJCOM/A3.
4.17. Midair Collision Avoidance:
   4.17.1. Man all flight deck seats below 10,000 feet mean sea level (MSL) to the maximum
   extent practical. Crews will maintain an IFR clearance for separation and use autopilot
   whenever practical. The navigator and pilots will use the weather radar when possible to
   search for traffic. The observer, when available, will be on headset and actively scan for
   traffic.
   4.17.2. Make seat changes for the AC or CP position with the autopilot and altitude hold
   engaged if practical. Initiate seat changes while stabilized in the IFR traffic pattern or above
   10,000 feet MSL. Emphasize clearing during the seat change.
   4.17.3. TCAS operation will be IAW AFI 11-202V3.
4.18. Equipment on the Flight Deck. Hold crew equipment and publications on the flight deck
to a minimum commensurate with mission requirements. Stowed equipment must not prevent
rapid egress from the flight deck.
4.19. In-flight Meals. The AC and CP should not eat meals at the same time and their meals
should consist of different menu items if prepared by the same flight kitchen or organization.
4.20. Fuel Requirements. For planning purposes, fuel reserves on all flights will be 18,000
pounds over the destination (or alternate when required) initial approach fix, or IAW AFI 11-
202V3, whichever is greater. Fuels listed herein are minimum required fuels. The PIC may plan
to arrive overhead with more fuel based on the dynamics of the mission (e.g. weather enroute,
airport enviroment, etc).
   4.20.1. Fuel required at the initial approach fix at the original destination will allow a
   penetration and one approach, then climb to optimum altitude and arrival over the alternate
   initial approach fix with 18,000 pounds of fuel or greater.
 32                                           AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


   4.20.2. Minimum landing fuel for flights on an IFR clearance is 15,000 pounds. ―Minimum
   Fuel‖ will normally be declared to the controlling agency when it is determined the aircraft
   may land at the intended destination with 15,000 pounds of fuel remaining or less. However,
   if the destination airfield is VFR, and after the aircraft is established in the airfield‘s radar
   and/or visual traffic pattern, practice approaches and landings may be conducted until 12,000
   pounds of fuel remain, provided CG limits are not exceeded or weather conditions deteriorate
   below VFR.
   4.20.3. ―Emergency Fuel‖ will be declared to the controlling agency when it is determined
   the aircraft may land at the intended destination with 10,000 pounds of fuel or less.
   4.20.4. When mission requirements dictate and when specifically approved by the applicable
   group commander, fuel reserves may be reduced (provided they meet or exceed AFI 11-
   202V3 requirements) to the following:
       4.20.4.1. Initial Approach Fix. 12,000 pounds.
       4.20.4.2. Minimum Fuel. 10,000 pounds.
       4.20.4.3. Emergency Fuel. 8,000 pounds.
4.21. Aircraft Ground Refueling. FEs are authorized to refuel the aircraft at bases where E-3
maintenance support is not available. When refueling/defueling aircraft, FEs will comply with
T.O. 1E-3A-2-7-5CL-1, Refueling and Defueling, T.O. 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft
and Static Grounding/Bonding and T.O. 1E-3A-2-7, Ground Handling-Servicing and Airframe
USAF Series E-3B and E-3C.
   4.21.1. Anytime adequate portable fire fighting equipment is unavailable or any condition
   listed under Abnormal Conditions, Section 1, T.O. 00-25-172 exists, the FE will notify the
   local fire department. The fire department will be informed of the abnormal condition and
   parking spot/location of aircraft. The FE should be informed by the fire chief of the estimated
   response time or if a standby fire truck needs to be in position prior to servicing.
   Communication capability will be immediately available.
   4.21.2. In the event base support is limited or nonexistent, other crewmembers may be used
   as refueling team members at the discretion of the AC. The flight engineer will brief all team
   members on the use of fire equipment, safety precautions, and emergency shutdown
   procedures.
4.22. Fuel Jettisoning. Conduct fuel dumping only to reduce gross weight in an emergency or
for operational necessity. When circumstances permit, dump above 5,000 feet AGL over
unpopulated areas or in designated fuel dump areas. Advise the appropriate air traffic control
agency of intentions, altitude, and location when fuel is jettisoned and when the operation is
complete. Make the appropriate entry on the AFTO Forms 781A/H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight
Status and Maintenance Document.
4.23. Aircraft Interior Lighting. During ground/flight operation, it is recommended to keep
flight deck lighting at the lowest practical level. During night parking, do not use the high level
flight deck lighting until after the aircraft is chocked and brakes are released. This will allow the
pilots to ensure that the aircraft does not roll.
4.24. Inflight Engine Failure. During peacetime training missions, if an engine is shutdown in
flight, terminate the mission and land as soon as practical, IAW TO 1E-3A-1. During
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                           33


contingency operations, if an engine is shutdown in flight, mission requirements may necessitate
continuing the sortie unless safety of flight is compromised.
4.25. Inflight Troubleshooting. After flight manual emergency procedures are complete,
aircrews will not conduct in-flight troubleshooting.
4.26. Flight Control Malfunctions:
   4.26.1. The following procedures will be adhered to when maintenance "redballs" for
   primary flight control malfunctions during preflight or ground operations. The AC along with
   maintenance personnel will evaluate the malfunction and determine appropriate actions
   necessary to provide an airworthy aircraft. If the malfunction cannot be isolated to a
   particular part and repaired within a suitable amount of time, the aircraft will be returned to
   maintenance for repair.
   4.26.2. Inflight, if a primary flight control malfunction is experienced, the flight crew will
   perform the appropriate flight manual procedures, terminate the mission, and land as soon as
   practical, IAW T.O. 1E-3A-1.
4.27. Divert Charts. Units will develop divert charts to cover their local operating areas and
publish them in their local chapter to this instruction. Information contained on these charts
should include divert airfields, headings, distances, flight times, fuel requirements, and cruise
altitudes. Carry divert charts on all flights.
4.28. Air-to-Air Refueling Restrictions/Procedures:
   4.28.1. AAR Refueling procedures will be conducted IAW ATP 56 (B), Air-to-Air
   Refuelling, and national annexes. Plan to AAR with a center of gravity forward of 32%
   MAC. AAR can be accomplished outside of these limits provided it is thoroughly briefed
   prior to conducting AAR.
   4.28.2. For all normal operations, the gross weight inflight with flaps up will be limited to
   the maximum gross weight versus altitude for a 2.5G load factor IAW TO 1E-3A-1, Section
   5. Use of gross weights versus altitude for a 2.0G load factor require applicable group
   commander approval.
   4.28.3. Do not accomplish AAR during training missions when any conditions are
   encountered which, in the opinion of the AC or boom operator, result in marginal control of
   the aircraft or the boom.
   4.28.4. Do not accomplish AAR if any primary flight control malfunctions are encountered
   or with the series yaw damper inoperative.
   4.28.5. Do not accomplish AAR without tanker disconnect capability, to include manual
   boom latching, unless an actual fuel emergency or operational necessity exists.
   4.28.6. Boom Envelope Demonstrations will be conducted under IP/SEFE supervision. The
   boom operator will initiate and ensure disconnect capability before demonstrating limits
   IAW ATP-56(B).
   4.28.7. Non-AAR qualified FPs are authorized to fly the aircraft up to and including
   precontact from either the right or left seat with an AC in the other seat, but must not close to
   the contact postion unless under IP/SEFE supervision. AAR qualified FPs are authorized to
   fly the aircraft up to and including contact from either the left or right seat with an AC in the
 34                                          AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


   other seat. Non-AAR qualified CPs are authorized to fly the aircraft up to and including
   precontact from the right seat with an AC in the left seat, but will not close inside precontact
   unless under the supervision of an IP/SEFE. AAR qualified CPs are authorized to fly the
   aircraft up to and including contact from the right seat with an AAR current AC in the left
   seat. CP AAR from the left seat will be conducted under IP/SEFE supervision.
   4.28.8. ACs/CPs undergoing initial qualification or upgrade training may conduct a
   rendezvous up to 1 NM from the tanker without IP/SEFE supervision.
   4.28.9. To allow time to establish communications with ATC, discontinue air refueling at
   least 3 minutes prior to the end of track and descend to the bottom of the block.
   4.28.10. Loss of Radio Contact. If contact is not established or is lost between tanker and the
   E-3 on the allocated AAR frequency, follow ―Loss of Radio Contact‖ guidance IAW ATP
   56(B).
4.29. Post AAR Procedures. Use the following procedures after completion of air refueling to
achieve safe separation from the tanker:
   4.29.1. The receiver pilot will maintain stabilized in the contact position while asking for or
   initiating a disconnect and will remain stabilized until confirming either visually or verbally
   that the boom is clear.
   4.29.2. After confirmation that the boom is clear, the receiver pilot will begin to move aft to
   the pre-contact position. Once this separation has been attained, the receiver pilot will begin a
   slow descent at approximately 500 to 1,000 feet per minute (fpm) and establish a power
   setting that will ensure increased vertical separation and avoid under-running the tanker
   during descent.
   4.29.3. The pilot will establish a minimum of 1,000 feet vertical separation between the
   receiver and the tanker. Do not make any turns from the established air refueling heading
   during the descent phase.
       4.29.3.1. Establish 1,000 feet vertical separation and engage autopilot (if available)
       before initiating the post-air refueling checklist. Slipway doors may be closed to reduce
       cockpit noise levels. The autopilot circuit breaker may be reset if opened prior to air
       refueling.
       4.29.3.2. To ensure safe separation during the separation maneuver, the pilot not in
       control of the airplane and the navigator will monitor the positions of all tankers in the
       formation by whatever means possible (visual, weather radar, air-to-air TACAN, etc.).
       4.29.3.3. If the receiver cannot descend to establish the required vertical separation, the
       receiver will move back to the precontact position and request the tanker initiate a climb
       to obtain a minimum of 1,000 feet vertical separation.
4.30. Formation Restrictions. The enroute cell and air refueling formations described in ATP-
56(B) are the only authorized formations. Crews will only fly these formations when specifically
tasked, using the procedures published in the appropriate tech orders.
4.31. Abnormal Configurations. Do not fly missions with known abnormal configurations
unless approved by the applicable group commander. Abnormal configurations can include a six
or seven brake only operation, partial spoilers, inoperative antiskid, etc.

                     MISSION CREW OPERATING PROCEDURES

5.1. E-3 Missions:
   5.1.1. E-3 Tactical Mission:
      5.1.1.1. The E-3 is a primary airborne element of the Theater Air Control System
      (TACS). Specific mission taskings, to include functioning as a Control and Reporting
      Center (CRC), will be determined by the Joint Force Air Component Commander
      (JFACC). The E-3 may be responsible for:
          5.1.1.1.1. Surveillance within its assigned area of responsibility (AOR).
          5.1.1.1.2. Detecting and assessing potential threats and passing threat calls.
          5.1.1.1.3. Forwarding accurate and timely surveillance data to the CRC/Air
          Operations Center (AOC) and crosstell appropriate surveillance data to adjacent
          command and control facilities.
          5.1.1.1.4. Identification of traffic in areas without existing ground identification
          authority or when ground identification facilities are degraded and not capable of
          providing the identification function.
          5.1.1.1.5. Issuing of scramble orders or airborne orders in the absence of ground
          tactical air control system (GTACS) or when authority is delegated by the AOC.
          5.1.1.1.6. Commitment of defensive counterair weapons. This may be self-initiated
          or directed by a AOC/CRC.
          5.1.1.1.7. Maintaining status of available weapons and equipment.
          5.1.1.1.8. Airspace regulation and control within an assigned control area.
          5.1.1.1.9. Maintaining continuous communications with other airspace control
          agencies.
          5.1.1.1.10. Relaying information/instructions from the AOC, CRC, and other
          elements of the TACS (i.e. Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System
          [JSTARS]) to airborne aircraft.
      5.1.1.2. When the primary or alternate AOC is inoperative, the JFACC may direct an E-3
      to continue to manage tactical air operations until the AOC becomes operational. Under
      this condition, additional E-3 responsibilities may include voice coordination with Army,
      Navy, Allied units, and Air Support Operations Centers (ASOCs).
   5.1.2. E-3 North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) Missions. The
   NORAD strategic air defense mission covers three roles: air sovereignty, tactical warning,
   and atmospheric defense. Air sovereignty is the peacetime policing of the combined
   US/Canadian sovereign airspaces to ensure that all air traffic using the airspace complies
   with national regulations. The second role of tactical warning includes detecting,
   characterizing, and assessing potential threats. The third role is the wartime role of
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                          37


   atmospheric air defense against an enemy threat or attack. NORAD performs these roles by
   integrating a variety of sensor equipment, communications, aircraft, and facilities.
   5.1.3. E-3 Counter Narcotics Terrorism. The E-3 counterdrug (CD) mission is to assist
   national agencies in interdiction of suspected drug traffic IAW command directives.
   5.1.4. Joint Tactical Air Operations (JTAO). Integration and coordination among all C2 units
   deployed to a particular theater is paramount for effective JTAO operations. JTAO
   operations are defined in the JTAO Procedural Handbook. E-3 crews must be fully trained to
   execute the Air Tasking Order (ATO), Airspace Control Order (ACO), and Operation Task
   Link (OPTASKLINK) in a joint environment to ensure proper force management and control
   of weapons systems. The entire system is dependent upon the effective use and control of
   data links. E-3 crews must understand their role within the joint data network and how their
   data can both aid and hamper JTAO. CJCSM 3115.01A, Joint Data Network Operations,
   outlines the duties of the Joint Information Coordination Center (JICC) and how the multi-
   link network is to be administered. E-3 crews will operate data link equipment IAW CJCSM
   6120.01C, Joint Multi-Tactical Data Link (TDL) Operating Procedures, and the written
   guidance of the Joint Interface Control Officer (JICO) (i.e. OPTASKLINK, OPTASK ID
   Supp, Tactical Operation Data (TACOPDAT)). During missions, the crew will adhere to the
   directions of the joint, regional, or sector interface control officers (J/R/SICO). Coordination
   will be performed on the assigned interface control net (ICN)/data link coordination net
   (DCN) and track supervision nets (TSN). All E-3 crewmembers participating on these nets
   must be familiar with directed net procedures and follow the directions of the net control
   station (NECOS).

5.3. Operational Procedures:
   5.3.1. Aircraft Mission Systems History Log Book. Maintain a history log book for each
   aircraft. Units will develop history log book procedures and ensure log books are readily
   available. Technicians will review the log book during preflight.
   5.3.2. Equipment Malfunctions. The MCC, after coordination with the AC on equipment
   issues which affect aircraft systems, must approve continued operations of malfunctioning
   mission equipment that would affect the mission. The MCC will evaluate the impact of using
   degraded equipment against the mission tasking and the inability to meet that tasking.
   5.3.3. Air Surveillance Procedures:
      5.3.3.1. Coordination. The ASO will coordinate with the SD, ECO, and MCC to ensure
      all activity is conducted on an appropriate map. Coordinate Command and Control
      Coordinate System (CCCS) origin changes with the MCC, CDMT and ECO prior to
      taking the switch action.
      5.3.3.2. Briefings. The ASO/SST will accomplish a surveillance briefing on mission
      planning day that will cover surveillance information and contracts applicable to the
      entire mission and/or flight crew. The ASO will also accomplish a surveillance
      specialized briefing prior to assuming station. As a minimum, this briefing will include
      surveillance areas not covered in previous briefings and any areas needing extra
      emphasis, such as individual taskings, surveillance contracts, ROE, symbology and
      tracking, identification plan, and contingency/emergency duties.
      5.3.3.3. Sensor Management/Procedures. Prior to assuming station, the ASO will
      perform sensor checks to determine the optimum radar/IFF settings for the mission. The
44                                        AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


     ASO will brief the MCC on the results of the checks and the final radar setup. Sensor
     check procedures include:
        5.3.3.3.1. IFF Sensor Check. Perform a systematic checkout of the IFF, to include all
        operational Receiver/Transmitters (R/T)s as soon as it becomes available. If
        equipment malfunctions, the ASO will accomplish an additional check once the unit
        is back on line. If a previously unchecked R/T unit comes on line, the ASO will again
        accomplish an additional check. As a minimum, the ASO will check:
            5.3.3.3.1.1. Mode IV Test. Perform a mode IV loop test prior to declaring the IFF
            operational.
            5.3.3.3.1.2. Maximum Range. Measure the maximum range of the IFF by
            determining the range of an IFF sensor return with a consistent (three out of seven
            returns) data trail.
            5.3.3.3.1.3. IFF Jitter. Check in all quadrants, as close as possible to, but not
            beyond, 250 NM from the E-3. Measure jitter as sideways displacement of returns
            from a straight-line path. Normally jitter up to 3 NM is acceptable.
            5.3.3.3.1.4. Quality. The overall quality of the IFF will be determined by
            checking consistency of data trails, and when radar becomes available, the
            mileage difference between the IFF and radar sensor returns. Normally, returns
            within 2 NM are acceptable. Accomplish this check within a radius of 250 miles
            from the E-3.
            5.3.3.3.1.5. Resolution of IFF Overloads. The ASO will monitor IFF counts and
            make necessary adjustments to resolve overload conditions and minimize the loss
            of IFF data.
        5.3.3.3.2. Radar Sensor Check. Time permitting, the ASO will check as many RF
        sets as possible, and select a primary and secondary RF set (preferably not in the
        same chain). The ASO will use identical radar tabular display settings for each RF set
        checked for accurate comparison. Radar mode will include both the Doppler and
        Beyond The Horizon (BTH) radars. A sensor quality check must be made when
        established in the orbit area if a checkout was made prior to arrival to the orbit area.
        The radar check will include:
            5.3.3.3.2.1. Doppler/BTH Maximum Range. Determine the maximum doppler
            range from the situation indicator display presentation using data trails with a
            minimum 40% blip-scan ratio (3 out of 7 scans have radar returns). A single data
            point, present or history, may be used to determine the maximum BTH range
            from the situation indicator display presentation.
            5.3.3.3.2.2. Quality. Radar quality is determined by the percentage of all IFF
            returns within a 250 NM radius of the E-3 that have consistent discernible radar
            data trails. In addition, consider the overall consistency of the radar presentation.
            Use the following criteria to assess the overall quality of the radar:
               5.3.3.3.2.2.1. Good. Greater than 50%.
               5.3.3.3.2.2.2. Fair. Between 30 to 50%.
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                       45


                5.3.3.3.2.2.3. Poor. Less than 30%.
            5.3.3.3.2.3. System Counts. On applicable form, log the Doppler, BTH, and
            Mode 3 counts for comparison of radar frequencies. Time of day, operating
            location, traffic density areas, and radar mode of operation may significantly
            affect the ratio of these figures.
            5.3.3.3.2.4. Sensor Re-Check Procedures. Once the sensors have been initially
            checked and declared operational, the ASO is not required to re-accomplish a full
            sensor check unless the applicable sensor system is powered down or if the ART
            accomplishes a Fault Isolation Test (FIT) on the radar system, i.e. after Quality
            Control (QC). In circumstances such as post-AAR where sensors are transferred
            but not powered down, the ASO will, at minimum, accomplish a quality check of
            radar and IFF systems prior to declaring them operational.
        5.3.3.3.3. Radar Setup. The ASO must consider the effects of the E-3 flight
        parameters on sensor performance and attempt to optimize checkout within these
        constraints. The assessment of overall air picture quality will be the primary factor in
        determining the optimum RF set.
            5.3.3.3.3.1. After selecting the optimum RF set, the ASO will declare the radar
            operational.
            5.3.3.3.3.2. When multiple E-3 flights operate in an area, the ASO will perform
            frequency deconfliction as required.
     5.3.3.4. Data Link Procedures and Operation. Data link is the primary means of passing
     E-3 information. Establish data links according to, Joint Multi-Tactical Data Link (TDL)
     Operating Procedures, for the JTIDS Network Library for JTIDS and TADIL A during
     Continental United States (CONUS) operations. Establish data link operations outside the
     CONUS according to local theater directives and the OPTASKLINK.
     5.3.3.5. Assuming Station. ASO will inform MCC of station assumption requirements
     not yet completed:
        5.3.3.5.1. Conduct data base checks as appropriate.
        5.3.3.5.2. IFF configured for mission use.
        5.3.3.5.3. Configure the radar settings and optimize sensors for maximum detection
        while maintaining air-picture quality.
        5.3.3.5.4. Track initiation on all data trails within the assigned AOR(s).
        5.3.3.5.5. Initiate contact with ground control agencies.
        5.3.3.5.6. Operational data links(s).
        5.3.3.5.7. PDS Download. The ASO is permitted to download PDS when an ECO is
        not on-board for the purpose of internal crew PDS displays training. Only an ECO
        will declare PDS operational. (Note: Without an ECO on-board PDS will not be used
        for such purposes as signal of interest location, coordination and reporting, electronic
        identification, and threat warning.
46                                        AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


     5.3.3.6. Voice Tell and Recording Procedures. When the E-3 is in an environment with
     units not capable of data link interface, use the following voice tell and recording
     procedures:
        5.3.3.6.1. The E-3 will voice tell priority one, two, and three tracks unless the
        receiving agency directs cease tell. Tell all other priorities on request only. For this
        purpose, the following priorities have been established:
            5.3.3.6.1.1. Priority One. Hostile/Faker.
            5.3.3.6.1.2. Priority Two. Unknown/Pending.
            5.3.3.6.1.3. Priority Three. Emergencies.
            5.3.3.6.1.4. Priority Four. Defensive Counter Air.
            5.3.3.6.1.5. Priority Five. VIP Flights.
            5.3.3.6.1.6. Priority Six. Special Missions.
            5.3.3.6.1.7. Priority Seven. Other tracks as directed by the receiving agency, (for
            example, Neutralized Fakers). Live tracks have priority over simulated tracks.
        5.3.3.6.2. Voice tell will normally be in United States Message Text Format
        (USMTF) TRKREP format. When it is impossible for the receiving agency to accept
        tell according to USMTF, use a format agreed upon by both agencies.
     5.3.3.7. Electronic Combat Procedures. The ASO will monitor/coordinate EP actions.
     Use the following procedures:
        5.3.3.7.1. The ASO, ECO and ART will coordinate on any unusual sensor activity to
        determine whether the source is external or internal and type of interface if able. If no
        explanation can be determined and the source is external, submit an Air Force
        Spectrum Interference Reporting System (AFSIRS) report.
        5.3.3.7.2. Make every effort in an EA environment to obtain active data on all EA
        targets. Whenever possible, use cooperative passive tracking. If cooperative support
        is not available, use self-passive tracking.
        5.3.3.7.3. When self-triangulating, to determine if one of several previously active
        tracking returns is a suspected EA emitter, the AST will extrapolate the suspected
        track on its last known heading, speed and altitude, before initiating a passive track. If
        two tracks are used, the ASO will coordinate with the MCC and SD to ensure proper
        weapons commitment.
        5.3.3.7.4. The ASO will keep the MCC and SD advised on status of passive tracks.
        When the ASO is confident that the passive track has correlated with the jammer‘s
        location, notify the SD that the track has ―stabilized‖ and enable display to weapons
        consoles. In the event of burn-through, the ASO, in coordination with the MCC and
        IAW ROE, may ―validate‖ the track as a jammer and associate the symbology with
        active data.
     5.3.3.8. Identification. When the E-3 is granted ID authority, the ASO will use all
     available capabilities and resources to ID tracks within its AOR according to the theater
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                     47


     ID Matrix (Note: PDS will not be used for identification purposes without an ECO to
     declare the system operational). The MCC will retain hostile declaration authority.
  5.3.4. Weapons Procedures:
     5.3.4.1. Station Assumption. Prior to assuming station, the SD will:
        5.3.4.1.1. Contact FAA/Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) or ground
        monitor/control authority, and complete a sensor correlation check as required.
        5.3.4.1.2. Check all weapons assigned radio frequencies for usability.
        5.3.4.1.3. Check data base accuracy.
     5.3.4.2. On-Station Procedures. Procedures will be according to the operational
     procedures contained in this instruction and specific mission directives.
     5.3.4.3. Off-Station Procedures. The SD will compile controlled aircraft mission totals
     and furnish this data to the MCC. The SD will pass totals to the ground monitor if
     requested/directed.
     5.3.4.4. SD Control Procedures. The SD may control aircraft during a mission after
     coordination with the MCC and when simultaneous missions are not in progress.
     5.3.4.5. Handoff Procedures. Handoff procedures IAW applicable FAA Letters of
     Agreement. The SD or a designated AWO will monitor the handoff frequency at all times
     when performing station assumption duties and while on station.
     5.3.4.6. Controlled Aircraft Emergency Procedures. For aircraft with in-flight
     emergencies, the SD/AWO performing the handoff will use the word ―Emergency‖ at the
     beginning and ending of transmissions to the recovery agency. In the event of an
     emergency being declared by an aircraft under E-3 control, the AWO will refer to their
     Aircrew Aids, ―Controlled Aircraft Emergency Procedures.‖
     5.3.4.7. Control Procedures. On-station control procedures will be IAW AFI 11-214,
     Aircrew and Weapons Director Procedures for Air Operations.
     5.3.4.8. Airspace. Use of airspace          will   be    IAW     Air   Traffic   Control
     Management/Airspace Control directives.
     5.3.4.9. Distressed Aircraft. Report any suspected or triangular distress patterns to the
     SD.
     5.3.4.10. Symbology. During all operations, AWOs will ensure symbology and sensor
     data of controlled aircraft are within 2 NM of each other. Weapons pairings to Combat
     Air Patrol (CAP), air-to-air intercept, and ground targets should be accomplished as
     briefed IAW mission TDL employment.
  5.3.5. Communications Procedures:
     5.3.5.1. Radio Procedures. Adhere to communications discipline at all times. All
     crewmembers will use proper International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) phrases,
     phonetic alphabet, and R/T procedures outlined in ACP 121, US Sup 2 (Communications
     Instructions, General-Air-Ground).
48                                         AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


     5.3.5.2. Priority of Message Transmissions. The E-3 aircrew, while in flight, will
     transmit messages according to the following priority:
         5.3.5.2.1. Flight Safety.
         5.3.5.2.2. Command and Control Information.
         5.3.5.2.3. Flight Regularity.
     5.3.5.3. Phone Patches. Units will establish phone patch procedures in their local
     chapter.
     5.3.5.4. Call Signs. Always use the aircraft callsign when transmitting messages of Flight
     Safety, aircraft movement, and radio calls required by this instruction. Mission
     crewmembers will use the mission crew call sign when communicating with the
     respective controlling or monitoring agency, aircraft under their control, or as
     fragged/briefed. The CSO will brief crewmembers on call signs to use when providing
     alternate communications.
     5.3.5.5. UHF/VHF Guard Monitoring Procedures. The MCC will ensure the mission
     crew monitors VHF and UHF guard frequencies. The MCC, SD, ECO, and AWOs will
     have UHF guard receive/transmit programmed to their consoles. While aircraft are under
     control by the mission crew, the SD will designate at least one weapons crewmember to
     monitor UHF guard. The ASO, SST, and ASTs will have VHF guard programmed to
     their consoles. The ASO will designate at least one surveillance crewmember to monitor
     VHF guard while the E-3 is on station.
  5.3.6. Mission Crew Intercom Procedures:
     5.3.6.1. The primary means of coordination for the mission crew will be via the
     programmed mission nets.
         5.3.6.1.1. Coordinate net assignments/deviations through the MCC.
         5.3.6.1.2. Maintain strict net discipline. Limit conversation to operational matters.
     5.3.6.2. Use the ADS selective intercom system for information that is unclassified,
     lengthy in nature, and/or person-to-person conversations.
     5.3.6.3. The PA system is for use in emergencies and practice emergencies. Except for
     emergency checklist items, use of the PA by mission crew is restricted to the MCC.
  5.3.7. Special Interest Track Procedures:
     5.3.7.1. A special interest track is any track that requires priority handling by the mission
     crew.
     5.3.7.2. The E-3 will not depart orbit or working area to continue monitoring the special
     interest track unless directed by the command authority exercising E-3 Tactical Control
     (TACON). Any instructions that are directive for the E-3 (i.e., leave/move orbit, changes
     in level of decentralization, etc.) will be authenticated by the MCC/Battle Director
     Technician (BDT).
     5.3.7.3. The MCC will:
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                         49


         5.3.7.3.1. Ensure the ASO assigns tracking responsibilities for the special interest
         track.
         5.3.7.3.2. Ensure the SD monitors the special interest track for possible intercept
         actions.
         5.3.7.3.3. Coordinate with the ASO and flight crew to maintain the special interest
         track within the E-3 surveillance limits (orbit location).
         5.3.7.3.4. Coordinate E-3 airspace changes (orbit location) with the flight crew, as
         required.
         5.3.7.3.5. Ensure the ECO monitors the special interest track for possible ID
         correlation.
     5.3.7.4. The ASO will:
         5.3.7.4.1. Give priority attention to the special interest track and assign it to an AST
         as a specific responsibility.
         5.3.7.4.2. Ensure the AST places the track in debriefing status, logs the time, track
         number, and ID on the appropriate forms.
     5.3.7.5. The SD will:
         5.3.7.5.1. Monitor the progress of the special interest track and conduct any tactical
         action on the track as directed.
         5.3.7.5.2. Scramble and/or direct aircraft for intercept as directed/necessary.
         5.3.7.5.3. After the accomplishment of the intercept, inform the MCC/ground
         monitor facility of any required information.
         5.3.7.5.4. Coordinate with the proper ground unit for recovery of the interceptors.
     5.3.7.6. The ECO will monitor the special interest track and make every effort to
     correlate all electronic signals eminating from the track. Log and/or hard copy, if
     available, all Augmented Report tabular displays (TDs) for emitters correlated to the
     track. If an ID can be derived from the correlated emitters this information will be passed
     to the ASO, SD, and MCC.
  5.3.8. Sensor Correlation:
     5.3.8.1. If control of aircraft is anticipated, accomplish a weapons correlation check prior
     to assuming station if required by LOA or as specified in FAA Order JO 7610.4M,
     Special Military Operations, if acting as an Military Radar Unit (MRU). If the E-3
     mission is surveillance only, the surveillance section will perform the check with the
     appropriate automated/manual tell agency(ies).
     5.3.8.2. Perform an IFF only correlation check if:
         5.3.8.2.1. The ASO subsequently correlates IFF to radar sensor returns, or,
         5.3.8.2.2. IFF only on-station operations are authorized according to this instruction
         and theater operating instructions.

     5.3.8.3. Coordinate procedures with the responsible MRU prior to assuming station when
     operating as an Airborne Radar Unit (ARU).
     5.3.8.4. When operating in Canada, the E-3 will comply with the DOT/DND agreement
     (short title, ―AWACS Agreement‖) between Director General Air Doctrine and
     Operations Department National Defense, and Director Air Traffic Services Department
     of Transportation.
     5.3.8.5. The following procedures apply to sensor correlation checks required by
     surveillance:
         5.3.8.5.1. Minimum of two tracks within the Air Defense Identification Zone
         (ADIZ), preferably in a non-congested area.
         5.3.8.5.2. Voice tell format will include the track number, coordinates, and Mode 3
         squawk (if possible). Tracks used must be within 3 NM or less to be considered a
         good sensor correlation.
         5.3.8.5.3. Successful data link correlation checks could be used instead of voice tell
         checks due to accurate real-time data being passed between both agencies.
  5.3.9. Electronic Support Procedures.
     5.3.9.1. Coordination. The ECO will coordinate with the MCC, ASO, SD, CDMT,
     DOW, and Electronic Support Team (EST) to ensure PDS is loaded with an appropriate
     database. The ECO will also coordinate with the MCC when PDS is downloaded, and
     operational. In addition the ECO will advise the MCC, CDMT and/or ASO of any system
     degradation(s).
     5.3.9.2. Sensor Management Procedures. Prior to assuming station, the ECO will
     perform checks on PDS to ensure operational status and determine optimal sensor set-up.
     The ECO will brief the MCC on the results of these checks.
         5.3.9.2.1. PDS. At a minimum, the ECO will check:
            5.3.9.2.1.1. Reception in Frequency Range. Check to ensure 360-degree
            reception of signals within all three bands: low, medium and high. This is a
            subjective check, but there should be several indications within each band on
            different azimuths.
            5.3.9.2.1.2. Triangulation. Triangulation of a known emitter (like an ATC radar
            at a civil airport) should be conducted. Once the active emitter file reaches
            ―monitor status,‖ check the location of the triangulated site against the location of
            the known emitter.
            5.3.9.2.1.3. Overload Management. Evaluate any reported overloads and correct
            as necessary. Overload conditions that cannot be resolved might indicate internal
            interference and should be corrected IAW established procedures.
     5.3.9.3. Data Link Procedures. The ECO should coordinate with the ASO/SST to ensure
     PDS data link filters are set correctly. The ECO will be responsible for selecting specific
     emitters to tell out during the mission.

     6.2.5.5.1. (18WG) (Added) Pilots, navigators, flight engineers and MCCs will mission
     plan efficiently to avoid carrying excess fuel. ACs should mission plan to carry the fuel
     required for the planned mission and recovery. Notify 961 AACS/DOO not later than
     1400 the day prior to the sortie if changes to the current ramp load are required.
        6.2.5.5.2. (Added-18WG) Standard Fuel Loads. HHQ/KTACS (135K); Down
        Under (120K); P-Sorties (92K / 80K + 12K loading). P-Sortie fuel loading is in
        accordance with TO 1E-3A-5-2, Loading Data USAF Series E-3B/C Aircraft Ground
        Refueling Charts, ball note procedures. Any deviations from these fuel loads require
        documentation on AF IMT 2407, Weekly/Daily Flying Schedule Coordination.
        6.2.5.5.3. (Added-18WG) Air-to-Air Refueling (AAR) Coordination. All AAR will
        be coordinated by Current Operations and scheduled through 18 OSS Tanker
        Scheduling (18 OSS/OSOT) no later than Tuesday 1200L Kadena, 1-week prior to
        the anticipated refueling time.
        6.2.5.5.4. (Added-18WG) Unless operational requirements dictate a higher
        airspeed, flight crews should not exceed long range cruise or .72M, whichever is less.
        Fuel burn targets for 961 AACS sorties will be as follows: for cruise and orbit use
        13,800 pounds per hour. For transition training, use 17,000 pounds per hour.
     6.2.5.5.5. (18WG) (Added) The starting engines checklist will normally be initiated 30
     minutes prior to take-off time.
        6.2.5.5.6. (Added-18WG) Kadena AB Fuel Requirements.
        6.2.5.5.6.1. (18WG) (Added) ―Off-island Bingo‖ – fuel required to arrive at the
        Kadena AB IAF with the minimum amount of fuel to fly one approach, accomplish a
        missed approach, and arrive overhead at a suitable weather alternate in accordance
        with AFI 11-202, Volume 3, General Flight Rules, and Attachment 21 with 18,000
        lbs of fuel. Flight crews will compute Off-Island Bingo on all sorties and a weather
        check will be accomplished within 1-hour of reaching Off-Island Bingo. If the
        weather at Kadena does not require an alternate and the current/forecast crosswinds
        are within limits, crews may use On-Island bingo requirements. When required, ACs
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                     57


        will notify the Operations Supervisor of the planned alternate in use and any changes.
        The AC is responsible for alternate selection; primary Off-Island alternates are Osan,
        Yokota, Misawa, and Anderson. Iwakuni is also available as an alternate, however
        PL-2 protection resources may be limited.
        6.2.5.5.6.2. (18WG) (Added) ―On-island Bingo‖ – Aircrew will arrive at the
        Kadena AB IAF with a minimum of 24,000 lbs of fuel. This provides 30 minutes of
        holding fuel prior to required divert to MCAS Futenma (primary) or Naha AB
        (secondary). When the VFR pattern is open, runway is dry, and cross-winds are 15
        knots or less, landing fuel may be reduced to 18,000 lbs. During Kadena AB single
        runway operations crews are required to arrive at the Kadena AB IAF with 33,000 lbs
        of fuel and landing fuel may be reduced to 28,000.
            6.2.5.5.6.3. (Added-18WG) The Operations Supervisor must approve use of
            On-Island Bingo if an alternate is required in accordance with AFI 11-202,
            Volume 3, for Kadena AB. Use of MCAS Futenma or Naha AB as an alternate
            requires close coordination with 18 OSS weather shop. The Ops Sup will assist
            the crew in maintaining situational awareness of weather developments.
        6.2.5.5.7. (Added-18WG) Missed AAR Procedures. Missions will not normally be
        planned to utilize a missed AAR alternate (i.e., AAR will not normally be scheduled
        after bingo time). If there are extenuating circumstances that require the use of such
        an alternate, the AC will coordinate with the CC/DO or a designated representative
        (ADO/operations supervisor) the day prior to the mission. At a minimum,
        coordination will include selection of an appropriate alternate and notification
        procedures in the event of a missed AAR divert.
  6.2.6. (Added-18WG) Mission Crew Planning.
     6.2.6.1. (Added-18WG) Communications Security (COMSEC)/Software Order. The
     Communications System Operator (CSO) and Computer Display Maintenance
     Technician (CDMT) will order COMSEC and software from the 961 AACS G flight (961
     AACS/CCG) software library located in the COMSEC vault during mission planning
     after determining cryptography requirements, recording and special software
     requirements (i.e., special DIODTs, test software, etc.). The CDMT will use 961
     AACS/DOM Form 1, 961st Master Recording RMA Request and Transfer Log.
     6.2.6.2. (Added-18WG) Removable Media Assembly (RMA) Kits. The CDMT
     standard mission kits include two program and two recording RMAs. The CDMT
     deployment mission kits include three program and three recording RMAs. Each CDMT
     recording RMA is able to store approximately 15 hours of mission recording. The
     Airborne Radar Technician (ART) standard mission kit includes two program/recording
     RMAs. The ART deployment mission kit includes three program/recording RMAs. The
     CDMT and ART will use a deployment mission kit when the temporary duty
     (TDY)/deployment exceeds 7 days. At a minimum, the computer and radar program
     RMAs will contain all operational programs and PACAF applicable databases. Inventory
     of kits will consist of verifying the serial number of the RMA against the transfer log,
     ensuring program RMAs are write protected (CDMTs only), and that the RMA partition
     listing folder is current and correct. RMA kits will be inventoried on mission planning
58                                        AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


     day. If pre-built kits do not meet mission/recording requirements, the CDMT/ART will
     coordinate with the software library to obtain specific software for the mission.
     6.2.6.3. (Added-18WG) COMSEC Kit. The COMSEC kit is built and maintained
     within the COMSEC vault. The kit will contain the necessary authenticator and call sign
     documents, cryptography key tapes and equipment for the mission employment area. All
     COMSEC material will be handled and stored in accordance with ARPCI 33-2110,
     Communications Security (COMSEC) User Requirements, AFKAG-1N, Air Force
     COMSEC Operations (FOUO) and AFKAG-2, Air Force COMSEC Accounting Manual

     Printout/Aircraft Mission Systems History Log Books. The ART/CDMT will retrieve the
     CAMS printout prior to the initial coordination meeting. This information will be
     disseminated to the CDMT, ART, and communications technician (CT) prior to mission
     crew coordination. Aircraft and systems status will be briefed during the coordination
     meeting and execution briefing.
         6.2.6.4.1. (Added-18WG) History Log Books Composition. Log books are divided
         into three sections: CT, CDMT, and ART. Each section will contain the originals of
         the five most recent in-flight logs with the most recent on top. The ART, CDMT and
         CT will determine the best equipment configuration based on recurring malfunctions.
         6.2.6.4.2. (Added-18WG) History Log Book Storage. The log book will be stored
         at the counter above the publications folders. The ART will pick up the logbook prior
         to flight for use in-flight or during deployment and will return the logbook to the
         FCIF bookshelf upon return.
     6.2.6.5. (Added-18WG) Electronic Support Measures Database (ESMDB) Preparation.
     The Electronic Combat Officer (ECO) will coordinate with ESMDB Support Team
     (EST) as required for mission support and devise ESMDB modifications based on
     mission and EST requirements.
         6.2.6.5.1. (Added-18WG) Coordinate with the EST for required ESMDB
         modifications prior to DIODT execution if the modifications are intended to be
         permanent.
         6.2.6.5.2. (Added-18WG) EST Tasking and Priorities. EST may task ECOs with
         mission objectives to improve database performance. Priority guidance for ECOs is:
         (1) E-3 self-defense, (2) air battle management mission priorities (electronic support
         over an area of interest), (3) mission crew contractual obligations (weapons activity),
         and (4) EST tasking. At times, the EST tasking may take priority over all matters
         except self-defense and will be identified during mission crew coordination briefing.
  6.2.7. (Added-18WG) Crew Coordination Drill (CCD). A CCD should be conducted
  during every KTACS and training sortie. CCDs are not required for P-Sorties or an OCF.
  The AC/MCC should coordinate with the firefighters to utilize training masks. Real-world
  masks are sealed and should not be used except in real-world emergency situations. The AC
  may make the pre-announcement for the CCD at any time during the flight. The AC and
  MCC will coordinate the exact timing of the CCD in coordination with onboard evaluators
  and instructors to ensure training/evaluation objectives are met. Crew members will preface
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                       59


   all calls made during the CCD with ―Simulated.‖ The MCC and AC will coordinate the
   termination of the CCD based on completion of training objectives. The AC will make a PA
   announcement to terminate the drill. In the event of an actual emergency, the drill will be
   terminated immediately by the AC, who will, if able, make an announcement over the public
   address (PA) system.
6.3. (Added-18WG) Aircrew Operating Procedures.
   6.3.1. (Added-18WG) Crew Manning. A basic crew is comprised of an AC, CP, Nav,
   Flight Engineer (FE), CSO, CT, MCC, Senior Director (SD) , three Air Weapons Officers
   (AWO), ECO, Air Surveillance Officer (ASO) , Senior Surveillance Technician (SST), three
   Air Surveillance Technicians (AST), CDMT and an ART. Either the CSO or CT should be
   experienced. Changes to crew loads will according to mission needs and approved by the
   DO/CC.
      6.3.1.1. (Added-18WG) KTACS Sortie Manning. KTACS missions require a basic
      crew plus one additional AST and one additional AWO.
      6.3.1.2. (Added-18WG) P-Sortie Manning. Minimum crew complement for P-Sorties
      will be an AC, CP, Nav, FE, one CSO or CT, and one additional crew member to act as a
      safety observer in seat five. A CSO or CT is not required on a local pattern-only P-sortie
      provided a flight crew member is trained to fly without a communications crew. This
      training will be conducted by the 961 AACS Training Flight (961 AACS/DOT) and will
      be documented in the individual‗s training record.
      6.3.1.3. (Added-18WG) SAFE HAVEN. Normally, one KTACS-type crew will
      maintain an RP-15 alert posture, known as SAFE HAVEN, throughout the year. During
      the continuous Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness (TCCOR) 4 period (generally 1
      June – 30 November) a second P-Sortie-type crew will also maintain a SAFE HAVEN
      posture in the event an evacuation is required. Higher headquarters tasking, force
      protection levels or regional tensions may result in additional alert requirements.
      6.3.1.3.1. (18WG) (Added) Crew members will review the SAFE HAVEN
      expectations binder and initial the load list on the SARM counter no later than noon on
      the day prior to assuming alert posture. Crew members are normally assigned SAFE
      HAVEN duty from sign in until 0900L of the next duty day for the SQ.
      6.3.1.3.2. (18WG) (Added) SAFE HAVEN crew members will ensure that they can be
      contacted at all times (either by telephone, cell phone or pager) and will not engage in
      activities that would prevent them from flying within 15 hours. Scuba diving is not
      allowed while on SAFE HAVEN. From mission planning until release, the AC and MCC
      will define crew accountability procedures and restrictions to meet mission requirements.
      If a crew member goes DNIF while on SAFE HAVEN, they will immediately inform the
      AC and MCC.
   6.3.2. (Added-18WG) Minimum Turn Time. Do not plan consecutive sorties with the
   same aircrew, or select aircrew members with less than 16 hours turn time from landing to
   subsequent takeoff, unless required to meet mission tasking and approved by the CC, DO, or
   DETCO. If an individual flies three consecutive sorties with less than 16 hours turn time,
   they will be given at least 36 hours off prior to their next takeoff. If mission requirements
   necessitate less than 36 hours time off, CC, DO, or DETCO approval is required.
60                                         AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


  6.3.3. (Added-18WG) E-3 Aircrew Flight Restrictions. To minimize the effects of jet-lag,
  aircrew members are prohibited from flying:
  6.3.3.1. (18WG) Within 24 hours of traveling between Kadena AB and Alaska or Hawaii.
  6.3.3.2. (18WG) Within 36 hours of traveling between CONUS and Kadena AB.
  6.3.4. (Added-18WG) Command and Control. The 961 AACS exercises command and
  control of E-3 resources through the 18th Wing Command Post (call sign ―Keystone‖) in
  conjunction with Squadron Operations (call sign ―Fireside‖).
  6.3.4.1. (18WG) (Added) OPCON. The Commander, Pacific Air Forces (COMPACAF)
  exercises OPCON directly over PACAF wings (i.e., not through the NAFs). Therefore,
  COMPACAF has OPCON of PACAF-assigned E-3s. All PACAF-assigned E-3s will be
  TACON to COMPACAF unless specified differently below.
     6.3.4.1.1. (18WG) (Added) E-3s participating in Joint Theater ISR missions will be
     OPCON to 13 AF/CC. 13 AF/CC will also hold TACON for these missions.
     6.3.4.1.2. (18WG) (Added) E-3s operating inside the Korean theater during
     armistice/KTACS missions are TACON to 7 AF/CC and remain OPCON to
     COMPACAF. All PACAF-assigned E-3s operating outside of Korea remain TACON to
     COMPACAF.
     6.3.4.2. (Added-18WG) OPCON Transfer. When OPCON is transferred to another
     command, all crew members are responsible for reviewing the applicable host unit read
     files, FCIFs, etc. Conflicts between host unit and home unit guidance should be
     identified to the DETCO or applicable OG/CC. If the conflict cannot be resolved, follow
     the most restrictive guidance that ensures flight safety.
  6.3.5. (Added-18WG) Crew Report Procedures. ACs will plan execution briefings to start
  no sooner than 5 minutes after crew report time. This time will enable crew members to
  accomplish mandatory pre-mission activities without impacting flight duty period.
     6.3.5.1. (Added-18WG) Go/No-Go Review. Prior to the crew show, the SARM will
     conduct an inspection of the crew members' PEX accounts to ensure FCIF
     compliance/publication issue compliance. Crew members that have not signed all
     applicable FCIF items will be identified. AC/MCC will brief the operations supervisor
     and ensure all crewmembers are aware of the latest FCIF guidance.
     6.3.5.2. (Added-18WG) Aircrew members will signify they have read and understood
     all applicable FCIFs by initialing the flight orders the day of the flight.
  6.3.6. (Added-18WG) Flight Authorization Review/Certification. The AC is responsible
  for accuracy of the flight authorization. The AC will initial any changes to the flight orders.
     6.3.6.1. (Added-18WG) Deleted Crew Members. If a crew member is removed from
     the flight, the AC will cross through the name on the flight orders and initial the deletion.
     6.3.6.2. (Added-18WG) Late Crew Members. Under extenuating circumstances, the
     AC for the flight may certify crew member knowledge by initialing the flight orders for
     the absent crew member. This crew member must be back briefed on the latest FCIF and
     safety items prior to aircraft departure. The AC will also certify for support personnel on
     flying status who report directly to the aircraft.
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                        61


      6.3.6.3. (Added-18WG) Add-On Crew Members. To ensure add-on crew members are
      not DNIF, a copy of the Aircrew Status Report will be maintained in the SARM. The
      AC/MCC will check the report and check the individual‘s Go/No-Go in PEX prior to
      adding a crew member to the flight orders.
      6.3.6.4. (Added-18WG) Flight Order Recycling. On deployments where new flight
      orders are not generated for each mission, the AC/MCC will ensure a copy of the original
      flight orders is available for crew members to initial before each flight. The AC will
      verify the orders before flight to ensure it accurately reflects crew manning. One copy of
      the initialed orders and passenger manifest will be left with Base Operations or Transient
      Alert.
   6.3.7. (Added-18WG) Aircraft Tours While Off-Station. In the absence of DETCO
   guidance, deployed crews can conduct tours using the following as basic guidance:
      6.3.7.1. (Added-18WG) AC or FE Control. The AC or FE must escort all off-station
      tours of the E-3. The AC or FE must ensure the transformer rectifier rotary switch is not
      in the ―Battery‖ position. Also, ensure the battery and emergency lights are turned off
      prior to departing the aircraft.
      6.3.7.2. (Added-18WG) Maintenance Control. At deployed locations with maintenance
      support, the AC or flight engineer is not required if maintenance has control of the
      aircraft. Tours will not conflict with aircraft maintenance. Tours will occur only with the
      prior consent from the AC.
6.4. (Added-18WG) Flight Crew Operating Procedures.
   6.4.1. (Added-18WG) Pre-departure Procedures.
      6.4.1.1. (Added-18WG) Filing Flight Plan. Flight plans will be faxed to Kadena Base
      Operations not less than 1-hour and no more than 24 hours before departure. A flight
      crew member will contact Base Operations to verify receipt of faxed flight plan.
      6.4.1.2. (Added-18WG) Handheld Global Positioning System (GPS) Kits.                  The
      handheld GPS 38 kits may be maintained as part of the aircraft installed life support
      equipment. When installed, the GPS kits will be included on the AFTO Form 46, Pre-
      Positioned Life Support Equipment and located in the forward cabinet immediately aft of
      the flight deck and across from the front main crew entry door. Preflight will be
      accomplished by the AC or designated representative, to include inspection of container
      condition, DD Form 1574 (Yellow Tag), Serviceable Tag – Materiel, for current
      inspection date and red pilfer seal integrity. The in-service GPS kits are not to be used
      for training/familiarization. Training GPS units are available for sign-out from Aircrew
      Flight Equipment.
      6.4.1.3. (Added-18WG) Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD). The flight engineer and
      pilots will verify whether the TOLD computed during mission planning is still valid for
      use the day of the flight. This should be done before the engines are started. Re-
      computation of TOLD due to weather changes such as wind gusts, Runway Condition
      Report (RCR), etc., that occur after engine start need only be recomputed if performance
      decreases. If the TOLD was computed for wet runways and the tower reports the runway
62                                        AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


     condition as dry, the TOLD must be recomputed. Refer to TO 1E-3A-1-1, Flight Manual
     Performance Data, for additional guidance.
     6.4.1.4. (Added-18WG) DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F –
     Transport/Tactical. On flights originating from Kadena AB, the AC will sign DD Form
     365-4 and give it to maintenance personnel before starting engines. For off-station
     sorties, the DD Form 365-4 will be filed at Base Operations together with DD Form
     1801, International Flight Plan, DoD.
     6.4.1.5. (Added-18WG) Downgrading a Red X for One-Time Flight. To clear the Red
     X on the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document, the owning
     MXG/CC or a representative designated to downgrade Red X conditions will enter in the
     corrective action block a statement as follows: ―Red X changed to Red Dash for the
     purpose of one-time flight to (Destination Station),‖ and if applicable, ―with en route stop
     at (name station).‖ If the MXG/CC or designated representative is not available to sign
     the ―Inspected By‖ block, continue the corrective action statement: ―One-time flight
     authorized by (Name, Rank, Title, Organization).‖
        6.4.1.5.1. (Added-18WG) Off-Station Downgrade. If the aircraft is located off
        station, the AC will contact home station MXG/CC or designated representative to
        obtain a faxed copy of written approval or verbal approval over the phone. The AC
        will then sign the ―Inspected By‖ block and initial the ―Symbol‖ block. In the next
        open block of the AFTO Form 781A, enter a Red Slash in the ―Symbol‖ block and
        current date in the ―Date Disc‖ block. In the ―Discrepancy‖ block, enter the original
        discrepancy with a descriptive statement of temporary repair or inspection
        accomplished to make the aircraft airworthy for a one-time flight. Also, enter
        restrictions to normal flight operation of systems/equipment such as gear operation,
        pressurization, altitude, or airspeed limitations. Sign the ―Discovered By‖ block
        (normally, the same person that downgraded the Red X).
     6.4.1.6. (Added-18WG) Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Prevention. All ground crew
     and aircrew members will ensure loose items and equipment are properly stowed or
     secured to minimize FOD potential. Pilots will use minimum practical power setting
     during all ground operations. All crew members share the responsibility for FOD
     prevention.
     6.4.1.7. (Added-18WG) Flight/Mission Ground Aborts.                If takeoff cannot be
     accomplished within a reasonable time (normally 3 hours after scheduled takeoff) due to
     maintenance or other problems, the AC and MCC will coordinate with the 961
     AACS/DO or Operations Supervisor to determine the practicality of continuing the
     mission. If takeoff delay exceeds 5 hours, the AC/MCC must carefully consider crew
     condition against operational and training necessities before continuing with the mission.
  6.4.2. (Added-18WG) Taxi Procedures.
     6.4.2.1. (Added-18WG) Off-Station Procedures. At locations without E-3 taxi lines,
     ACs will brief a clear taxi plan with the crew chief prior to entering the aircraft. This
     discussion should focus on the initial turn direction, potential obstructions, and the
     location of the lead marshaller and wing walkers.
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                            63


     6.4.2.2. (Added-18WG) Local Taxi Flow. At Kadena, flight crews will normally
     request the standard taxi flow as described in Kadena ABI 13-204, Airfield Operations
     Instruction. Flight crews will only request non-standard taxi routing when an immediate
     launch is necessary, standard taxi flow would result in a late takeoff, or the standard route
     is blocked.
     6.4.2.3. (Added-18WG) Clear Water Rinses (L-11 Rinse Facility). E-3 aircraft at
     Kadena will be clear water rinsed in accordance with TO 1-1-691, Aircraft Weapons
     Systems -- Cleaning and Corrosion Control. Crews will taxi through the L-11 Rinse
     Facility after every flight, provided it is open and no reason exists not to (e.g., bird strike,
     hydraulic/controllability malfunctions, etc.). Rinse facility operations are specified in
     Kadena ABI 13-204.
        6.4.2.3.1. (Added-18WG) Airfield Coordination. Ground or Tower controller will
        advise aircrew of Lima 11 Rinse Facility accessibility and operational status.
        6.4.2.3.2. (Added-18WG) Configuration/Taxi Procedures.             Accomplish normal
        after-landing checklist items EXCEPT do not shutdown any operating engine or start
        the APU until the aircraft is through the Rinse Facility. When approaching the
        service apron, lower the flaps and raise the spoilers prior to entering in order to rinse
        the maximum amount of area. Turn off landing lights prior to entering the wash.
        Once completed, reconfigure flaps, spoilers, engines and APU in accordance with the
        After-Landing Checklist while taxiing to park.
  6.4.3. (Added-18WG) Departure Procedures.
     6.4.3.1. (Added-18WG) Hot Mic Procedures. The AC and CP will use ―Hot Mic‖
     during all initial takeoffs. The use of ―Hot Mic‖ at other times will be at the discretion of
     the AC.
     6.4.3.2. (Added-18WG) During critical phases of flight, a maximum of two flight crew
     instructors/evaluators are permitted to stand.
     6.4.3.3. (Added-18WG) Communications Procedures. As soon as practical after
     takeoff, the navigator will inform the 961 AACS Operations and 18 WG Command Post
     of the actual takeoff time as referenced to the fragged time (i.e., ―Ronin XX, Line 1, Frag
     minus two‖). For deployed operations, takeoff times will be passed to the appropriate
     command post/detachment operations section.
     6.4.3.4. (Added-18WG) AFTO Form 117. FEs will ensure that an AFTO Form 117,
     USAF E-3 Individual Aircraft Tracking Program (IATP), (―Purple Dot‖) is completed on
     all flights.
     6.4.3.5. (Added-18WG) Severe Weather Advisories. Base Weather will issue a
     ―Lightning Watch‖ approximately 30 minutes prior to anticipated thunderstorm activity
     within 10 NM of Kadena.
        6.4.3.5.1. (Added-18WG) ―Observed Lightning within 10 NM‖ will be issued when
        a lightning strike has occurred within 10 NM. Flight line operations may continue
        with only the 10-mile warning in effect at the discretion of flight line supervisors.
        6.4.3.5.2. (Added-18WG) ―Observed Lightning within 5 NM‖ will be issued when a
        lightning strike has occurred inside of 5 NM. Depending on where the thunderstorm
64                                        AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


        forms, the 10-mile warning may not always precede the 5-mile warning. Either or
        both warnings will be issued and cancelled as dictated by the proximity of the storms.
        Flight line operations will cease while the 5-mile warning is in effect. When the
        flight line is shutdown, personnel will evacuate and seek shelter inside a building,
        enclosed vehicle or aircraft until Base Weather cancels the warning which caused the
        shutdown. All warnings will be cancelled when thunderstorms are no longer within
        10 NM of Kadena.
  6.4.4. (Added-18WG) On-Station Procedures.
     6.4.4.1. (Added-18WG) Navigation System Crosscheck. During all position checks
     navigators will crosscheck the aircraft position with a dual distance measuring equipment
     (DME) fix, dual radial fix, or radial/DME fix when within radio aid range and equipment
     permits. Navigators will compare each navigation steering source (GPS1, GPS2, INU1,
     INU2, EGI1 blended data, EGI 2 blended data) to the designated pilot source. The
     NAVAID fix, designated pilot solution, and time of system crosscheck will be plotted on
     the enroute chart and compared for accuracy. The difference between the positions will
     be annotated in the navigator‘s In-flight Log.
     6.4.4.2. (Added-18WG) Navigation System Malfunctions. Whenever the mission crew
     is ―Ops Normal‖ or ―On-station‖, the navigator will immediately notify the MCC of any
     navigation system discrepancies. Navigators will document faults in the aircraft forms.
     6.4.4.3. (Added-18WG) Trans-Oceanic Flights & Flights Outside Navigation Radio-
     Aid Range.
        6.4.4.3.1. (Added-18WG) Navigators will plot both the planned route of flight and
        the ATC-cleared route of flight on the chart. The navigator will accomplish a Gross
        Navigational Error (GNE) coast out/in fix and compute an equal time point (ETP)
        within one hour after level off. Additionally, an ETP will be calculated anytime the
        planned route of flight takes the E-3 more than 90 minutes away from a useable
        aerodrome.
        6.4.4.3.2. (Added-18WG) To prevent GNE (Gross Navigational Errors),
        approximately 10 minutes after each turn point, the navigator will plot the designated
        pilot‘s position on the chart and compare it to the intended route of flight.
        6.4.4.3.3. (Added-18WG) Navigators will crosscheck all navigation information.
        Compare the designated pilot‘s position against the non-designated pilot‘s position
        and all pertinent navigational information on both the ―STR‖ and ―PSN‖ pages.
        Verify that both positions are accurate, all information correlates to anticipated data,
        and that the calculated winds correspond to the forecasted winds.
        6.4.4.3.4. (Added-18WG) Navigators will provide an outbound heading to the pilot
        no later than 2 minutes prior to a turn point. Headings, ETAs, and distances will be
        crosschecked against the computed flight plan in conjunction with each fix and prior
        to each turn point.
        6.4.4.3.5. (Added-18WG) Navigators will fly with a PGU on all trans-oceanic
        flights or flights outside of navigation radio-aid range. Flying without a PGU
        requires SQ/DO approval.
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                       65


     6.4.4.3.6. (18WG) 6 (Added) Navigators will re-wind their flight plan prior to stepping
     to the jet to ensure having the most accurate data available.
         6.4.4.3.7. (Added-18WG) Trans-oceanic flight will be defined as any flight where
         the E-3 will be out of radio Navigation Aid (NAVAID) range for longer than 1 hour.
     6.4.4.3.8. (Added-18WG) Crews will monitor ATC/ARINC, and VHF/UHF Guard
     frequencies at all times when on an oceanic clearance. It is highly advisable for crews to
     monitor VHF transoceanic common (123.45 MHz) as well.
  6.4.5. (Added-18WG) Flight Plan Crosscheck. GNEs are on the rise DoD-wide. It is
  critical that aircrews cross-check headings, estimated time of arrival (ETA), distances and
  fuel state against the computed flight plan and clearance at each successive waypoint. It is
  also highly advisable to have a second pilot or navigator reconfirm the route of flight in the
  GINS any time ATC revises the clearance in-flight.
     6.4.5.1. (Added-18WG) Any changes to the route of flight will be annotated on the
     navigators enroute chart, along with time of clearance (if applicable), and a projected
     course to the next waypoint to ensure SUA or other enroute hazard deconfliction.
  6.4.6. (Added-18WG) AAR Procedures.
     6.4.6.1. (Added-18WG) Local AAR Procedures. The following procedures are
     applicable to 18th Wing E-3s and all visiting E-3s air refueling with 909th Air Refueling
     Squadron (909 ARS) KC-135s in any local AAR track within 300nm of Kadena.
         6.4.6.1.1. (Added-18WG) Emission Control (EMCON) Procedures. EMCON 3
         will be standard for AAR in visual meteorological conditions (VMC). EMCON 2
         will be standard for AAR in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). Deviations
         from these standards are permitted. Deviations must be coordinated and approved by
         aircrews and controllers and be in compliance with TO 1-1C-1-27, E-3 Refueling
         Procedures, and Allied Tactical Publication (ATP)-56. Under no circumstances will
         aircrews allow EMCON 3 procedures to compromise flight safety.
         6.4.6.1.2. (Added-18WG) Rendezvous (RV). A RV Delta at the AAR control point
         (RVCP) using air-to-air (A/A) tactical air navigation (TACAN) will be the standard
         rendezvous. The receiver will notify the tanker if unable to meet AAR control time
         (ARCT) +/- 2 minutes. E-3 rendezvous and refueling will be conducted on the
         primary/secondary refueling frequencies (dependent on ALTRV and published
         refueling track). Coordinate any changes as required.
         6.4.6.1.3. (Added-18WG) Opportune AAR Coordination. E-3 aircrews desiring
         opportune AAR will contact the operations supervisor to coordinate with 18 OSS
         scheduling for airspace and Tiger Operations for tanker availability.
     6.4.6.2. (Added-18WG) When an operational requirement exists on tail-swap,
     deployment and HHQ directed missions, crews are approved by the 18 OG to use gross
     weights past the 2.5G load limit (above the Aerial Standard Fuel Load line). Crews will
     observe the appropriate reduced load limits in the ―Gross Weight Limit versus Altitude
     and Maneuvering Load Limits‖ in T.O. 1E-3A-1, Figure 5-8. Crews will also ensure that
     aircraft center of gravity limitations are observed.

     6.4.6.3. (Added-18WG) Fuel On-Load Verification. FEs will verify fuel on load with
     the boom operator and log this amount in the AFTO Form 781H (Reverse) [Servicing
     Data].
  6.4.7. (Added-18WG) Diversion Instructions.
     6.4.7.1. (Added-18WG) Should the aircraft need to divert for weather or safety reasons,
     the following apply:
     6.4.7.2. (Added-18WG) The preferred divert bases for Kadena-based E-3s are Osan
     AB, Yokota AB, Misawa AB, Andersen AFB, Futenma and Naha AB. Futenma will be
     used as a preferred divert base for sorties scheduled to recover at Kadena AB. Selection
     of an alternate airfield will be in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 3, and based on
     existing/forecasted weather conditions, airfield status and fuel on board (see Attachment
     20 and Attachment 21). These bases are only recommendations and do not preclude the
     pilot from selecting an alternate location coordinated with the Operations Supervisor or
     Squadron DO.
     6.4.7.3. (Added-18WG) After landing, the AC/MCC will contact the 18th Wing
     Command Post (DSN 315-634-1800) and provide takeoff and landing times, durations,
     and any other information requested. During normal duty hours, flight information,
     aircraft status, and disposition of crew should be passed to the CC/DO/operations
     supervisor. If unable to contact the 18th Wing Command Post, contact the 5 AF
     Command Post (DSN 315-225-2536/9905).
  6.4.8. (Added-18WG) Pattern Training and Procedures.
     6.4.8.1. (Added-18WG) Non-Kadena Transition. Transition outside Kadena AB
     requires CC, DO, or DETCO approval. In addition to guidance in command directives
     and TOs, airfields must have an operating control tower, adequate emergency response
     (immediate crash response), and fuel servicing capability. The following airfields meet
     the criteria for transition training: Kadena AB, Osan AB, Yokota AB, Kunsan AB,
     Misawa AB, and Andersen AFB. However, approval from the CC, DO, or DETCO is
     still required. Transition at all other airfields requires coordination prior to takeoff as
     well as approval from the CC, DO, or DETCO.
     6.4.8.2. (Added-18WG) Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) Training Approach. An
     operational backup approach is mandatory when flying NDB training approaches unless
     conditions are day, VMC or 18 OG/CC approves.
  6.4.9. (Added-18WG) Engine Running Crew Changes (ERCC).                 ERCCs will be
  coordinated and published in the weekly flying schedule. All ERCCs will be considered one
  sortie for scheduling and maintenance through-flight purposes. Two sorties will be logged
  on the AFTO IMT 781 in accordance with AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.
     6.4.9.1. (Added-18WG) ERCCs are subdivided into two categories which require
     different engine shutdown procedures and parking requirements. The two categories are:
         6.4.9.1.1. (Added-18WG) Category        1    (Extensive   Aircrew/Passenger/Very
         Important Person (VIP) Up/Downloads): Used when downloading the entire mission
         crew, swapping flight-deck crews, or VIP up/downloads. Park on November taxiway
         in front of the 961 AMU hangar. Left wing engines (#1 and #2) will be shutdown
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                        67


         using TO 1E-3A-1, Taxi Back, Boarding/Deplaning checklist procedures.
         Maintenance support will be in place to include specialist launch vehicle, air stairs,
         crew chief support, and a fireguard. This will be the primary ERCC procedure.
         6.4.9.1.2. (Added-18WG) Category          2      (Minimum         Aircrew/Passenger
         Up/Downloads): All engines running, park on November taxiway in front of 961
         AMU hangar or hammerhead (Operations Supervisor will drop off/pick up crew).
         Maintenance will chalk, at a minimum, the nose gear in order to start brake cooling
         procedures. The AC will coordinate parking with Kadena Ground Control and the
         Operations Supervisor will coordinate with maintenance, for the up/download of crew
         member/passenger(s). TO 1E-3A-1 checklists will be accomplished and brake energy
         checked.
     6.4.9.2. (Added-18WG) Airborne crew will notify 961 AACS squadron operations of
     maintenance status and VIP transportation requirements. The operations supervisor will
     notify the 961 AMU Production Superintendent no later than 30 minutes prior to
     aircraft‗s arrival.
         6.4.9.2.1. (Added-18WG) If the aircraft is code three for maintenance of a system
         needed on the proficiency flight and requires an engine run, the aircraft will be parked
         on an approved engine run spot. If the estimated ground fix time exceeds 1-hour, the
         ERCC will be canceled.
         6.4.9.2.2. (Added-18WG) If aircraft is code 3 for a mission system, coordinate with
         the 961 AMU/MA, and operations supervisor for a decision on whether to continue or
         cancel the ERCC.
  6.4.9.3. (18WG) (Added) All aircraft engines that are shutdown will be restarted using TO
  1E-3A-1 procedures, utilizing a crew chief maintaining interphone contact with the pilot and
  a fireguard manning a fire bottle.
  6.4.9.4. (18WG) (Added) ERCCs will not be planned when fuel service is required on the
  returning aircraft.
  6.4.10. (Added-18WG) Bird Strikes.
  6.4.10.1. (18WG) 1 (Added) Aircrews experiencing bird strikes, regardless of the severity,
  will report the event to the tower, radar approach control, other controlling agencies, and the
  Ops Sup on the ―Fireside‖ frequency. Report bird strikes to the 961 AACS Safety Office
  within one duty day and fill out AF IMT 853, Air Force Wildlife Strike Report, Non-
  Damaging Bird Strike Report as required. Bird strikes on aircraft operating at bases other
  than Kadena AB will be reported to ATC and the flying safety officer at the landing base.
  The AC will also complete AF IMT 853, and file at the base of occurrence. In either case,
  notify 961 AACS CC/DO/Safety Officer as soon as practical.
  6.4.10.2. (18WG) (Added) Following a suspected or confirmed bird strike, aircrews should
  land as soon as conditions permit to have the aircraft inspected by qualified maintenance
  personnel. Bird strike damage cannot be accurately assessed in flight and undetected damage
  may result in a complex airborne emergency. Only qualified maintenance personnel on the
  ground can make reliable damage assessments. Following a suspected bird strike, do not use
  rinse facilities so that safety and maintenance personnel can examine the remains.
68                                         AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


  6.4.11. (Added-18WG) In-flight Emergencies.
     6.4.11.1. (Added-18WG) Single Source Coordination. All ground support should be
     channeled through one individual, usually the Operations Supervisor or Tech Rep, to
     minimize confusion and multiple source inputs during a critical phase of
     flight/emergency. Once the in-flight emergency (IFE) aircraft is in the terminal area,
     only the Tech Rep and IFE crew should transmit on the IFE frequency. Other supervisors
     should not transmit on the IFE frequency unless the transmission is required to prevent a
     mishap. Any and all assistance should be provided as requested by the aircrew and Tech
     Rep only.
     6.4.11.2. (Added-18WG) Fuel Jettison. Fuel dumping will be conducted in accordance
     with Kadena ABI 13-204.
     6.4.11.3. (Added-18WG) Immediate Landing Directed. If the aircraft is directed to
     land immediately, ensure the directions are clearly understood between the Operations
     Supervisor and the AC. The fuel jettison criteria in Kadena ABI 13-204 must be met. If
     the criteria cannot be met, the AC should use other means of reducing gross weight.
     6.4.11.4. (Added-18WG) Alternate Manual Landing Gear Extension Procedures. The
     flight engineer will annotate in red ink that the nose gear down lock pin is installed in the
     AFTO Form 781A. During the maintenance debrief, the AC will ensure maintenance
     personnel are aware the procedure was performed.
     6.4.11.5. (Added-18WG) Post Emergency Requirements. An in-flight or ground
     emergency, air abort for aircraft system malfunction, dropped object, or any high mishap
     potential incident must be reported to the 961 AACS Safety Office (961 AACS/SE)
     within 24 hours of the incident. The AC will fill out 18 WG Safety Office (18 WG/SE)
     Form 1, 18th Wing One-Hour Report, and e-mail (preferred) or fax a copy to the 18
     OG/CC, 18 MXG/ CC, 18 WG/CC/CV/SE, and 961 AACS/CC/DO/SE as soon as
     practical after landing. When operating at an off-island location, notify the host base
     safety office as well.
  6.4.12. (Added-18WG) Pilot Weather Categories.
     6.4.12.1. (Added-18WG) Category A. Aircraft commanders with over 200 combat
     mission ready (CMR) hours and who have been certified by their squadron commander
     may fly approaches to published minimums or 200-feet height above touchdown (HAT)
     and 1/2 mile visibility, whichever is greater. This certification will be posted in the
     member‘s training folder.
     6.4.12.2. (Added-18WG) Category B. Aircraft commanders who do not meet Category
     A criteria may fly approaches to published minimums or 300 feet HAT/height above
     aerodrome (HAA) and one mile visibility, whichever is greater. Category B minimums
     can be waived to Category A minimums by the 18 OG/CC/CD or the appropriate
     OG/CC/CD when OPCON has been given to another command.
  6.4.13. (Added-18WG) Pilot Certifications. Conduct pilot certifications in accordance with
  Pilot Training Guide as defined in the 961 AACS Training Policy.
  6.4.14. (Added-18WG) E-3 flight operations under Due Regard.
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                          69


      6.4.14.1. (Added-18WG) Military operational situations may not lend themselves to
      ICAO flight procedures; e.g., military contingencies, classified missions, politically
      sensitive missions, routine aircraft carrier operations, and some training activities. Flight
      under "due regard" or "operational" conditions obligates the aircraft commander to act as
      his or her own air traffic control and to separate his or her aircraft from all other air
      traffic. There must be "due regard for the safety of navigation of civil aircraft" when
      flight is not being conducted under ICAO flight procedures.
      6.4.14.2. (Added-18WG) E-3 Due Regard Special Instructions.
         6.4.14.2.1. (Added-18WG) AC will ensure route of flight does not activate
         commercial airline TCAS TA/RA. If the tactical situation permits, the AC will
         ensure TCAS is operational with Mode 3A and 3C on within 20 nm of an active air
         route. AC will maintain 10nm lateral spacing or 3k' vertical spacing from airline
         traffic. AC will maintain visual with traffic if weather conditions permit. Caution
         should be given as airliners may climb or descend without warning. AC will ensure
         flight deck monitors applicable sector ATC frequency and UHF/VHF guard.
         6.4.14.2.2. (Added-18WG) Nav will confirm with MCC that applicable jet routes
         are displayed on console. Nav will make a 40nm call to the MCC prior to crossing an
         active air route to ensure flight path deconfliction.
         6.4.14.2.3. (Added-18WG) MCC (assisted by SD/AWO if available) will ensure
         there is no conflicting airline traffic. MCC will ensure vectors are given to the AC to
         maintain 10nm lateral spacing or 3k' vertical spacing from airline traffic.
6.5. (Added-18WG) Mission Crew Operating Procedures.
   6.5.1. (Added-18WG) Pre-departure Procedures.
      6.5.1.1. (Added-18WG) Liquid Cooling System (LCS) Resistivity Procedures. If a
      static resistivity level below 3 MΩ/cm is encountered during the ART‗s preflight, the
      ART is required to perform the Ethylene Glycol and Water (EGW) Resistivity Check
      procedure in TO 1E-3A-43-1-1, Flight Manual USAF Series E-3B and E-3C Aircraft
      Mission System Operations. If the resistivity level remains below 3 MΩ/cm after
      performing the procedure, the ART will then request an Environmental Control System
      (ECS) technician to evaluate the LCS. After the technician has validated the resistive
      level, the following guidance will be adhered to:
         6.5.1.1.1. (Added-18WG) For an LCS resistive level between 1.5 and 3.0 MΩ/cm,
         the ART will coordinate with the MCC, FE, and ECS technician to collectively
         decide whether to accept the aircraft for out-and-back sorties. The resistive filter will
         be changed prior to departure for TDYs and deployments.
         6.5.1.1.2. (Added-18WG) LCS EGW Leak Procedures. For an LCS resistive level
         less than or equal to 1.5 MΩ/cm, the filters will be changed and the resistive level
         will be verified. EGW Leak Procedures are outlined in T.O. 1E-3A-43-1-1 for
         abnormal conditions. The ART will contact the FE and maintenance if an EGW leak
         is found during preflight. There is no tolerance for an EGW leak. Maintenance will
         ground the aircraft until the leak is corrected.
      6.5.1.2. (Added-18WG) Supplemental Oxygen Considerations.
70                                        AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


        6.5.1.2.1. (Added-18WG) MA-1 Portable Oxygen Bottle.
            6.5.1.2.1.1. (Added-18WG) Aircraft should have a minimum of 10 fast-filling
            MA-1 portable oxygen bottles on board. Prior to accepting an aircraft with less
            than 10 fast-filling oxygen bottles, the AC and MCC will assess the
            operational/safety impact based on crew makeup and mission profile (i.e. P-
            Sortie, over water, number of personnel on board).
            6.5.1.2.1.2. (Added-18WG) Fast-fill bottles should be prioritized for firefighter
            and runner duties (on firefighter masks including those in the lower lobes and
            above seats 9, 12, 15 and 22).
            6.5.1.2.1.3. (Added-18WG) When more than 10 fast-fill bottles are on-board,
            the AC/MCC will determine the location of the additional bottles. These bottles
            should be readily accessible to a runner looking for an extra bottle.
        6.5.1.2.2. (Added-18WG) Emergency Personal Oxygen System (EPOS).
            6.5.1.2.2.1. (Added-18WG) Prior to flight, the MCC will ensure that one EPOS
            is distributed to each person sitting in seats not equipped with system oxygen.
            Only 10 EPOS are carried by 18 WG E-3s.
            6.5.1.2.2.2. (Added-18WG) In the event of an actual emergency requiring the
            use of supplemental oxygen, crew members in seats without system oxygen will
            initially use the MA-1 portable oxygen bottle. If the bottle cannot be maintained
            due to slow refill or is required for the bottle refill team, the EPOS may be used to
            ensure adequate oxygen is available.
            6.5.1.2.2.3. (Added-18WG) The EPOS will not be used during a simulated
            emergency.
            6.5.1.2.2.4. (Added-18WG) Required Oxygen Quantity (LOX).                    Pilot
            proficiency sorties will be serviced to a minimum of 45 liters.
            Deploying/Tailswap aircraft will be serviced to a full system or 75 liters. All
            mission sorties/HHQ will be serviced to a minimum of 55 liters of LOX. Mission
            training sorties will be serviced to the amount determined by the AC and FE for
            mission execution. If an aircrew shows at an aircraft that is serviced with less
            than 55 liters, the aircraft commander will assess the LOX requirements based on
            the mission profile prior to accepting the aircraft for flight. FEs should contact
            the squadron‘s operations desk as soon as practical after discovering an under-
            serviced LOX tank to determine the AC‘s intentions.
     6.5.1.3. (Added-18WG) The ASO will designate a member of the surveillance team to
     conduct an accountability check of life support equipment prior to each flight. The
     designated crew member will accompany the technicians and flight engineer to the
     aircraft and report the results of the inspection to the aircraft commander. The same crew
     member will conduct a second accountability check after the completion of the mission
     and report discrepancies to the ASO.
  6.5.2. (Added-18WG) On-Station Procedures.
     6.5.2.1. (Added-18WG) Sensor Correlation. The SD will normally complete a
     correlation check (radar/identification friend or foe (IFF)) with an appropriate ground
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                       71


     agency as soon as practical after sensors are declared operational. If the surveillance
     section performs a correlation check with a ground agency for on-station, the correlation
     can be used for control of aircraft provided the correlation check is within 2 nm. If the
     SD or the surveillance section cannot contact a ground agency for a correlation check, an
     aircraft with radio contact with the E-3 can be used for a correlation check by comparing
     its reported TACAN position or an alpha check against its radar/IFF position data. Use
     only external aircraft for correlations, not E-3 TACAN position, due to the possibility of
     undetected errors in GINS/INU/computer interface. The E-3 cannot act as a control
     facility until a correlation check has been accomplished.
     6.5.2.2. (Added-18WG) Local Training Sortie Sensor Requirements. On local training
     sorties, the E-3 may assume or maintain on-station status for weapons control if either the
     primary radar or IFF is inoperative, as long as the other system is functioning. The MCC
     will coordinate with the ASO and SD to ensure the radar or IFF system is adequate for
     aircraft control. At the SD‗s discretion and MCC concurrence, they may elect to control
     activity IFF or radar only. Controllers will voice to aircraft under control ―Cowboy is
     IFF / Radar only and unable traffic advisories, broadcast control only. No snaps, vectors
     or altitude changes can be provided.‖
     6.5.2.3. (Added-18WG) Local Radar Limitations. Radar frequencies RF3 and RF6 (A3
     and B3) will not be used on training sorties within the Japan Air Defense Identification
     Zone (ADIZ).
     6.5.2.4. (Added-18WG) During local training sorties, establish voice contact UHF
     TADIL-A with respective Japan Air Self-Defense Forces (JASDF) Direction Center
     (DC). Most 961 AACS sorties work with Southwestern DC call sign ―Roderick‖, located
     in Naha, Okinawa. If proceeding to another JASDF DC, Kadena AB based E-3s must
     connect with respective DC in accordance with USAF/JASDF standard operating
     procedures.
     6.5.2.5. (Added-18WG) Standard Airspace and Aircraft Point-Out Procedures in the
     Down Under ALTRV.
        6.5.2.5.1. (Added-18WG) Airspace Policy. All air-to-air engagements will remain
        within the lateral and vertical confines of the assigned working area. Every effort
        will be made to remain more than 3 nm inside area borders. Engagements that spill
        out of the area will be ―terminated‖, if safety of flight is not a factor. If safety of
        flight is a factor, then the engagement is to be "knocked off.‖ Whenever a tanker
        orbit is in use, only aircraft actively involved in AAR operations may enter the
        confines of the AAR block. All other aircraft will remain a minimum of 1,000 feet
        above or below the AAR block. All air-to-air engagements within 3 nm of the lateral
        boundary of AAR airspace will be immediately terminated. This does not preclude
        tankers from participating in high value airborne asset (HVAA) retrograde scenarios.
        6.5.2.5.2. (Added-18WG) Airspace Boundary Point-Out Procedures. Controllers
        will make an airspace advisory call when an airspace violation is imminent. When
        multiple groups are engaged, ―Terminate‖ with call sign (if known) and location
        information will be used to stop a fight on the airspace border. Controllers will
        ensure aircraft acknowledge the ―Terminate‖ and immediately cease the local
72                                         AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


        engagement. Aircraft outside airspace boundaries will ensure de-confliction from any
        air traffic and expeditiously re-enter the airspace.
     6.5.2.6. (Added-18WG) Altitude Bias Effect on E-3 Control. During the course of
     normal operations, Link-16 operators have identified an altitude bias between the Mode
     C IFF pressure altitude and Link-16 Precise Participant Location and Identification
     (PPLI) reported altitude. The altitude bias is due to the different methods of calculation
     used to report altitude. These calculation differences have resulted in up to +/- 2,000-ft
     disparities. To mitigate the possibility of using different altitude sources, controllers are
     directed to use Mode C instead of PPLI reported altitude for altitude de-confliction.
     6.5.2.7. (Added-18WG) Have Quick (HQ) Procedures. Attempt to use HQ on every
     sortie where it is practical to do so. All local sorties will require a HQ load and check.
     Use clear frequencies when an integral player is unable HQ or if Lightsword provides
     control (not HQ capable).
     6.5.2.8. (Added-18WG) Link 16 Procedures.           USAF E-3s will not transmit JTIDS
     within 5 nm of TACANs.
     6.5.2.9. (Added-18WG) Live Electronic Attack (EA)/Electronic Protect (EP)
     Procedures. Live jamming will not be operated within territorial limits of Japan
     (extending 12 nm from Japan land areas) or within 25 nm of established international
     maritime/aeronautical routes. Jammers (spot, sweep, or barrage) will not be utilized to
     jam land-based radar installations in Japan. This restriction is imposed by the
     government of Japan. Commander, US Forces, Japan (COMUSJAPAN) can approve
     jamming for special use airspace within the Japan ADIZ.
     6.5.2.10. (Added-18WG) Equipment Malfunctions. Assistance to airborne aircraft is
     available through satellite communications (SATCOM) or secure UHF (when available)
     or a clear phone patch to the SQ operations. Clear-voice phone patches are available
     through any USAF Global High Frequency (HF) station. Secure communications should
     be used to discuss mission equipment malfunctions and will be used for matters involving
     classified or operational security (OPSEC) information. USKAT 1105 is the key list for
     secure communication with the SQ operations.
     6.5.2.11. (Added-18WG) Communications/Operations Security. COMSEC/OPSEC is
     an essential element to missions flown by the 961 AACS because of their locations and
     sensitivity. UHF, HF, and SATCOM secure voice will be used to the maximum extent
     possible. On missions where secure voice cannot be used, crew members must know and
     use proper authentication and encode/decode procedures.
     6.5.2.12. (Added-18WG) Communications Procedures. As soon as practical prior to
     landing, the CSO will pass maintenance codes and ETA to ―Keystone‖ using clear
     communications. If secure communication is required, relaying through "Fireside‖ may
     be used as a backup.
  6.5.3. (Added-18WG) Off-Station Procedures.
     6.5.3.1. (Added-18WG) Data Destruction. Data destruction procedures must be
     performed whenever classified material cannot be stored on the aircraft (e.g., if the
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                           73


     software kit cannot be stored on the aircraft due to security, the data destruct procedures
     would be required during power down).
  6.5.4. (Added-18WG) Post-Flight Procedures.
     6.5.4.1. (Added-18WG) COMSEC Inventory. COMSEC materials will be inventoried
     and the AFCOMSEC Form 16, COMSEC Account Daily-Shift Inventory, will be
     annotated prior to exiting the aircraft. All keying devices [except Data Transfer Device
     (DTD) and Simple Key Loader (SKL)] will be zeroized. The DTDs and SKLs will be
     updated and all materials will be returned to the COMSEC vault.
     6.5.4.2. (Added-18WG) Debriefings. Normally, debriefs will be done in the squadron.
     On-the-jet debriefs are allowed as mission requirements dictate and the crew applies the
     following: (1) Debriefing conducted in accordance with Attachment 15; (2) does not
     interfere with flight safety and recovery; (3) at least one flight deck representative is
     available to relay crew coordination and mission specific information; and (4) lessons
     learned are compiled by MCCand presented to 961 AACS/DOW for review/action. If a
     thorough debrief cannot be completed on the jet, it must be completed after landing.
     6.5.4.3. (Added-18WG) Intelligence Debriefs. Debrief any combat search and rescue
     (CSAR) or loss of friendly aircraft; tracks of interest; any reactions to friendly aircraft; or
     Joint Spectrum Interference Report, both radar and communications. Intelligence will be
     available for post-flight debrief following any KTACS or higher headquarters (HHQ)-
     directed mission unless released by the MCC in coordination with the operations
     supervisor. If an unusual event occurs or any of the above criteria are met during a local
     training sortie, the MCC will notify the operations supervisor, who will ensure
     intelligence is available to debrief the crew immediately following the mission.

Terms
Aircrew—Use this term to describe the complete complement of personnel required to fly an
operational mission. It composes both the flight crew and the mission crew.
Critical Phases of Flight—Critical phases of flight are takeoff, air to air refueling, flight below
5,000 feet AGL, approach, landing, and any other maneuver listed in this instruction requiring
IP/SEFE supervision.
Flight Crew—The flight crew is responsible for the safe ground and flight operations of the E-3
aircraft. It consists of an AC, FP or CP, Nav, and FE. For purposes of this instruction, Flight
Crew Training (FCT) personnel are considered flight crew members; however, contractor
personnel will not occupy primary E-3 crew positions during critical phases of flight.
Group Commander—For sorties under AFRC OPCON, the 970th Airborne Air Control
Squadron Operations and Training (O and T) officer (or designated representative) acts as the
applicable group commander.
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                          81


Instructor/Standardization Evaluation Flight Examiner (SEFE) Supervision—
Instructor/SEFE supervision requires an instructor/SEFE who is qualified and current in the
position and the maneuver that will be performed. Individuals not qualified or current in the
aircraft, require instructor/SEFE supervision for the activity in which they are unqualified or
noncurrent. For unqualified or noncurrent pilots, IP/SEFE supervision requires the IP/SEFE to be
in one of the pilots‘ seats with immediate access to the controls while the maneuver is being
performed. For all other crewmembers, instructor/SEFE supervision requires over-the-shoulder
observation of the unqualified/non-current crewmember. During critical phases of flight, flight
crew instructors/SEFEs are allowed to stand, all others will be at the discretion of the PIC.
Mission Crew—The mission crew consists of those individuals responsible for the command,
control, surveillance, communications/electronic, and management functions, to include the
control and monitoring of assigned aircraft, sensor management, internal and external
communications management for mission operations, and onboard systems maintenance. It
consists of the Mission Crew Commander (MCC), Senior Director (SD), Air Weapons Officer
(AWO), Air Surveillance Officer (ASO), Electronic Combat Officer (ECO), Senior Surveillance
Technician (SST), Air Surveillance Technician(s) (AST), Computer Display Maintenance
Technician (CDMT), Airborne Radar Technician (ART), Communications Systems Operator
(CSO), and the Communications Technician (CT).
Mission End Time (MET)—(AFRC only) The scheduled day and time a flight crew is planned
to return to home station from an exercise or deployment. The MET will be published in the
monthly Operations Plan, rotation schedule, flying schedule, and/or OPORD, as necessary. The
MET is the baseline for computing Scheduled Return Time.
Mission Essential Ground Personnel—Individual who perform unique support duties directly
related and essential to the particular aircraft or mission being flown. The OG/CC (or
equivalent) with operational control of the aircraft being flown grants MEGP status.
NORAD Battle Staff—The battle staff assists the crew performing aerial operations within the
NORAD area of operations (AO). The battle staff is responsible for managing the air battle and
carrying out the required command and control functions. It has the responsibility and authority,
as directed by the appropriate commander, to ensure the most effective use of assigned resources
to accomplish the mission. The Battle Director Technician(s) (BDT) are ACC/PACAF E-3
crewmembers specifically trained to support the NORAD mission. Supported commanders may
also provide a NORAD Airborne Battle Commander (NABC) and NORAD Weapons Resource
Officer (NWRO). PACAF/AFRC E-3 crewmembers will be trained and certified by local
procedures using a command approved syllabus.
Operational Control (OPCON)—Command authority that may be exercised by commanders at
any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Operational control is inherent in
combatant command (command authority) and may be delegated within the command.
Operational control is the authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate
forces involving organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating
objectives, and giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission. Operational
control includes authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training
necessary to accomplish missions assigned to the command. Operational control should be
exercised through the commanders of subordinate organizations. Normally this authority is
exercised through subordinate joint force commanders and Service and/or functional component
 82                                          AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


commanders. Operational control normally provides full authority to organize commands and
forces and to employ those forces as the commander in operational control considers necessary
to accomplish assigned missions; it does not, in and of itself, include authoritative direction for
logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal organization, or unit training.
Squadron Aviation Resource Management (SARM)—The office responsible for, but not
limited to publishing flight crew orders, flight and mission crew kits, and tracking the squadron‘s
aircraft locations.
Scheduled Return Time (SRT—)—(AFRC only) A force management tool used by the on-
scene commander to assure return of the Reserve associate personnel to home station before the
expiration of their active duty orders. The SRT is calculated MET plus 24 hours.
Tactical Control (TACON)—Command authority over assigned or attached forces or
commands, or military capability or forces made available for tasking, that is limited to the
detailed direction and control of movements or maneuvers within the operational area necessary
to accomplish missions or tasks assigned. Tactical control is inherent in operational control.
Tactical control may be delegated to, and exercised at any level at or below the level of
combatant command. Tactical control provides sufficient authority for controlling and directing
the application of force or tactical use of combat support assets within the assigned mission or
task.
Transition—Practice multiple takeoffs, simulated emergency patterns, low approaches and
touch and go landings. Transition timing begins when the aircraft crosses the threshold on the
first approach.
Wing Commander—For sorties under AFRC OPCON the 513th ACG Commander (or
designated representative) acts as the WG/CC.

                       E-3 BAGGAGE AND EQUIPMENT LOADING

A2.1. Flight Engineer Responsibilities:
   A2.1.1. Verify an AFTO Form 781A entry was made when On-Board Spare (OBS) kits are
   loaded.
   A2.1.2. Ensure the removal of the forward two metal boxes of the OBS kits after arrival at a
   TDY location, if the stay will be longer than 3 days.
   A2.1.3. Ensure only enough cleaning supplies are stored in the galley compartment to clean
   the area for one mission. Store the remaining cleaning supplies and all onboard bench stock
   in the dedicated crew chief box in the aft lower lobe.
A2.2. Loading Procedures. The following loading procedures apply to all E-3 operations. For
more specific guidelines, refer to the following T.O.s: 1E-3A-1, 1E-3A-5-1, 1E-3A-5-2, and 1E-
3A-2-7.
   A2.2.1. OBS Kits. An OBS kit consists of as many as five metal boxes and one fiberglass
   box containing an inertial navigation unit (INU). If maintenance requires OBS kits, install the
   five metal boxes in the forward lower lobe using the rail system described in T.O. 1E-3A-2-
   7. Any other method of securing the metal boxes in the forward lower lobe is not acceptable.
   Secure the INU in the ―J‖ compartment with cargo straps. Weight of OBS kits vary. The
   actual weight is annotated on each box. The crew chief will be responsible for recording the
   weights of each box and its location with an AFTO Form 781A entry. For mission planning
   purposes, use the standard weight of 650 pounds in the forward lower lobe and 127 pounds in
   ―J‖ compartment. Make adjustments on DD Form 365-4 as necessary. After arrival at a TDY
   location, if the stay will be longer than 3 days, remove at least the forward two metal OBS kit
   boxes from the aircraft to allow for better access to the area for firefight-ing, etc., if the
   location has a means of securing the kits.
   A2.2.2. Technical Orders. Carry one case of T.O.s when an OBS kit is loaded. Store in the
   ―J‖ compartment and secure with cargo straps.
   A2.2.3. Tool Box:
       A2.2.3.1. Secure the inflight tool box carried by the CT in the ―J‖ compartment with
       cargo straps.
       A2.2.3.2. When a crew chief tool box is required, secure it at the tiedown point in the aft
       lower lobe or in ―J‖ compartment with cargo straps.
   A2.2.4. Crew Baggage. In order to facilitate loading, crewmembers and PAX will maximize
   the use of soft luggage (i.e., issued B-4, A-3, and hang-up bags) for exercises and
   deployments. Crewmembers should be aware that proper aircraft/loading requires strapping
   the load down tightly in order to prevent load shifting. Crewmembers are normally allowed a
   baggage limit of 25 pounds on short term TDYs (7 days or less) and 55 pounds on longer
   deployments. However, if on mission planning day, weight appears to be critical, the AC and
   FE will determine the maximum allowable baggage weight and inform crewmembers and
   passengers of how much they will be allowed to carry. Baggage will be secured at a height
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                      89


  no higher than 40 inches in ―J‖ compartment. Small, carry-on type baggage may be stacked
  higher that 40 inches provided they are secured at or below 40 inches.
  A2.2.5. Jackets and Garment Bags. Jackets and lightweight garment bags may be stored on
  the clothing rack next to the lavatory.
  A2.2.6. SF6. Up to four additional SF6 bottles, empty or full, may be stored in the aft lower
  lobe. Bottles will be secured in the SF6 storage racks, if the aircraft is modified. If not
  modified, use cargo straps, and up to four small bottles can be stored.
  A2.2.7. RMA Kits. Store RMA kits in the area under the DDI at seat 8.
  A2.2.8. Additional Baggage/Equipment. ―J‖ compartment loading will be accomplished
  IAW T.O. 1E-3A-5-2.
  A2.2.9. General:
     A2.2.9.1. Mission crewmembers should store professional gear (i.e., pubs/helmet bag)
     either in ―J‖ compartment or at their individual consoles in a manner that will minimize
     movement of gear.
     A2.2.9.2. Compartment weight limitations will be IAW T.O. 1E-3A-1.
     A2.2.9.3. Crew bunks will only be used for storing pillows and blankets which will be
     secured by seatbelts. Nothing will be stored beneath the bunks. Floor rings used to secure
     bunks to the floor will not be used for luggage/equipment tiedown.

                                Attachment 16 (Added-18WG)
       KOREAN THEATER AIR CONTROL SYSTEM (KTACS) OPERATIONS

A16.1. (Added-18WG) Purpose. This attachment establishes procedures and guidance for all
KTACS sorties. TACON for E-3 operations within the Korean Theater is 7 AF. The E-3
receives mission tasking from ―Keyboard‖, the 7 AF command element (607 COS/DO). Key
coordination agencies in the Korean Theater of Operations include the 621 Air Control
Squadron, call sign ―Cobra‖ and 313 Electronic Intelligence Squadron, call sign ―Booster‖.
A16.2. (18WG) General.
   A16.2.1. (Added-18WG) KTACS Schedule. AC/NAV/MCC/SD will confirm the E-3 is
   correctly tasked on the Air Tasking Order (ATO).
   A16.2.2. (Added-18WG) Tasking. Crews must be familiar with ACCR 55-3 (S), ID and
   IFF/SIF Procedures (U), ACCR 55-20 (S), Theater Air Control and Employment Procedures
   (U), ACCR 525-4 (S), UNC/CFC Armistice ROE (U), and weekly and quarterly SPINS.
   A16.2.3. (Added-18WG) Aircrew Operating Procedures.
       A16.2.3.1. (Added-18WG) 37th Parallel Restrictions.          The following requirements
       must be met prior to operating north of the 37th parallel:
          A16.2.3.1.1. (Added-18WG) The threat level must be confirmed via external
          sources as ―low‖.
          A16.2.3.1.2. (Added-18WG) Flight and mission systems must be operational.
          A16.2.3.1.3. (Added-18WG) Operational Reconnaissance Mission. AFI 36-2803,
          PACAF Supplement, The Air Force Award and Decorations Program, has
          conflicting guidance for awarding O-9 credit to crews operating E-3 aircraft in the
          PACAF theater of operations. Use the PACAF memorandum titled Clarification for
          Awarding Aerial Achievement Medals in accordance with AFI 36-2803, PACAF
          Supplement.
       A16.2.3.2. (Added-18WG) P-518 Restrictions. Operations within 25 nm of P-518 and
       50 nm of the demilitarized zone (DMZ) should be minimized to limit risk to the E-3.
       Operations within 10 nm of P-518 are restricted under normal circumstances.
       A16.2.3.3. (Added-18WG) Peacetime operations within 25 nm of a prohibited area and
       50 nm from a potentially hostile border will normally be limited to intervals of less than 1
       hour.
       A16.2.3.4. (Added-18WG) Deep Look Orbits. Primarily used to support Electronic
       Support taskings. AC/MCC should use when flight safety allows. Permission to initiate
       a Deep Look Orbit must be coordinated with ―Keyboard‖ and Incheon Control. Do not
       expect Incheon Control to be familiar with the phrase ―Deep Look‖. When coordinating
       the clearance with ATC, make the request using the appropriate NAVAIDs.
   A16.2.3.5. (Added-18WG) The operations supervisor will ensure any delays or
   cancellations are passed via secure telephone equipment (STE) to the Korean Air Operations
   Center (KAOC)/Airborne Battlefield Command and Control (ABC2) Cell at DSN 784-8352.
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                        127


A16.3. (Added-18WG) Flight Crew Operating Procedures.
   A16.3.1. (Added-18WG) Flight Rules in Republic of Korea (ROK). Incheon Center is the
   controlling agency for all IFR traffic over the ROK. The AC will coordinate all orbit
   requests, Deep Look requests, and transit between orbit, Deep Look, and air refueling
   airspace with Incheon Control. Additionally, the AC will coordinate with Cobra Control
   when operating in any of the special use airspace over the ROK. Coordination with Cobra
   Control will include the status of both ―Hot Areas‖ (Surface-to-Surface or Surface-to-Air
   Fire in special use airspace) and ―Active Areas‖ (aircraft operations in special use airspace).
   The E-3 will squawk Mode 1 in accordance with ACCR 55-3, Attachment 1.
   A16.3.2. (Added-18WG) Changing of AAR Time. Crews will not adjust refueling times
   for any reason except flight safety, without specific approval from ―Keyboard‖ (when
   activated), ‖Cobra‖ or 961 AACS CC/DO. If unable to contact ―Keyboard‖ or ―Cobra‖ for
   coordination and approval, the refueling will be met as originally scheduled. If the tanker or
   E-3 requires early or late refueling and ―Keyboard‖, ―Cobra‖, or squadron CC/DO cannot be
   reached, the MCC will coordinate with the AC to determine whether or not to adjust the
   ARCT based on the current tactical situation, projected air activity, necessity of the AAR to
   complete the mission, and other operational considerations. Ground agencies will be notified
   of the change as soon as practical.
   A16.3.3. (Added-18WG) Off-Island Bingo. When 961 AACS SATCOM is unavailable,
   the MCC will relay the AC‗s request to fly below off-island bingo to the 961 AACS
   Operations Supervisor through ―Keyboard‖ or ―Cobra‖ (via secure radio).
   A16.3.4. (Added-18WG) Orbit considerations. File a mixed IFR/VFR flight plan (DD
   Form 1801 code ―Y‖) and report ―direct random orbit‖ at the IFR termination point to
   Incheon Center. Navigators will check published airspace schedules and AIRADS during
   mission planning to ensure safety of flight and annotate them on a chart.
   A16.3.4.1. (18WG) (Added) Dragon Orbit. The Dragon orbit is defined by a MOU
   published weekly and maintained in Current Operations. Normally, it is a racetrack orbit
   inside the area bounded by the coordinates N36 58 E124 10, N36 58 E 124 40, N34 47 E 124
   40, and N34 47 E124 10. Navigators will verify the altitudes and coordinates during mission
   planning. Communication with Incheon Control is sporadic in this orbit. Use AWACS
   monitor and MCC threat monitor as required.
   A16.3.4.2. (18WG) (Added) Palace Orbit. The Palace orbit is a race-track orbit with the
   southern lobe centered at N3620 E12730 and a 20 nm radius and the northern lobe at N3700
   E12730 with a 15 mile radius. Either lobe may be used for a Circle pattern as well.
   Normally, the orbit will be flown between FL290 and FL320. If transitioning from Palace to
   Dragon expect to ride the line to the edge of MOAs 16 and 18. Use AWACS monitor as
   required.
   A16.3.4.3. (18WG) (Added) Transitioning to Air Refueling in Mallipo. Mallipo is an
   unusually short A/R anchor located in MOA 16 and R80. A roll-in point should be
   considered due to the length of the IP/CP line. If R80 is ―hot‖, the northern half of Mallipo
   will be unavailable and the confines of the remaining airspace can make a normal rendezvous
   challenging. Due to the location of the MOAs along the west coast, there is no direct routing
   that allows for normal aircraft separation. From the Dragon Orbit, coordinate with Cobra
 128                                        AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


   Control to proceed to the southwest corner of MOA 16 to enter Mallipo. From the Palace
   orbit, coordinate to proceed to Conan (KUZ/R219017), then ―ride the line‖ between MOA 17
   and 19 to Mallipo.
A16.4. (Added-18WG) Mission Crew Operating Procedures.
   A16.4.1. (Added-18WG) Communications. The CSO will attempt SATCOM contact with
   ―Keyboard‖ as soon as practical, but no later than 45 minutes after takeoff. Once SATCOM
   contact is established, the MCC or designated crew members will monitor until secure UHF
   communications are established with ―Keyboard‖. Maintain secure UHF throughout the
   mission, using secure SATCOM as a backup. If secure communication is unavailable,
   contact will be maintained in the clear and classified traffic will be passed as required using
   WESTPAC code words. ECO will establish secure UHF or SATCOM with ―Booster‖, or
   have relay capability through ‖Keyboard‖ while on station.
   A16.4.2. (Added-18WG) Command and Control (C2) Communication. When ―Keyboard‖
   is not activated, primary communications are with ―Cobra‖ using secure UHF or SATCOM.
   The MCC or designated crew member(s) will monitor this frequency throughout the duration
   of the mission.
   A16.4.3. (Added-18WG) Sensor Operations. Under normal conditions, both an operational
   mission radar and IFF are required for all KTACS missions. The E-3 will not assume or
   remain on-station without mission radar and IFF. Reference KTACS Armistice SPINS for the
   approval authority for radar-only operations
   A16.4.4. (Added-18WG) Radar Malfunctions. If a radar malfunction occurs, an orbit will
   be selected based on the current KTACS Defense Readiness Condition level to minimize
   actual threats to the E-3 and maintain UHF communication with ―Keyboard‖ and/or ―Cobra‖.
   In a low-threat environment (AC/MCC determination), the southern lobe of the Palace orbit
   may be used for troubleshooting. After 30 minutes, or if the estimated time of completion is
   extended or undetermined, a maintenance orbit in the vicinity of Gwang-ju or Daegu must be
   established. For operations in the Dragon Orbit, the southern lobe is suitable for extended
   maintenance or wake-up operations.
       A16.4.4.1. (Added-18WG) Coordination and Troubleshooting.              If all in-flight
       troubleshooting possibilities have been exhausted and the radar remains inoperative, the
       crew may complete voice tell and/or data link training in the maintenance orbit. Radio
       coordination and troubleshooting with ground maintenance personnel will be via secure
       means. Approval for ―IFF-only‖ control must be received from ‖Keyboard‖ and at no
       time will the E-3 proceed north of the maintenance orbit.
   A16.4.5. (Added-18WG) Radar Frequency Limitations. Aircrew will not operate the radar
   in the RF5 and RF6 frequencies (B2 and B3).
   A16.4.6. (Added-18WG) Data Link Operations. The E-3 will enter the KTACS link in the
   receive-only mode, as soon as possible, while en-route to the orbit. Active mode operations
   should not be conducted until coordination has been accomplished with the Interface
   Coordination Unit, ―Cuechalk‖. The SST may pre-coordinate link entry prior to stepping to
   the jet for takeoff. Link-16 terminal synchronization will be attempted as soon as possible.
A16.5. (Added-18WG) On-Station Procedures.
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                       129


  A16.5.1. (Added-18WG) Requirements. The MCC will not call on-station until: 1) the
  ASO determines the radar and IFF are operational, 2) effective coverage of the Area of
  Interest (AOI) is established, and 3) communications are established with ‖Keyboard‖(when
  activated) or ‖Cobra‖, either directly or relayed through ―Cuechalk‖ or other ground
  agencies.
  A16.5.2. (Added-18WG) On-Station Reporting. The MCC will check in with ‖Keyboard‖
  via secure means on the UHF C2 command net or SATCOM. The MCC will provide the
  following information: (1) Position off Osan and altitude, (2) Destination, (3) Timing based
  on frag/alibis, (4) Projected Bingo time, and (5) Current ATO/SPINS. Example call would
  be: ―Keyboard, Cowboy is on-station, Osan 159 / 70, 29,000 feet. En Route Palace Orbit as
  fragged minus Passive Detection System (PDS) capability, projected off-island Bingo 1545
  India, using ATO EB Change 1, Weekly Spins Change 2, and Exercise Spins Change 0.‖
  A16.5.3. (Added-18WG) Surveillance Procedures. Surveillance will be conducted in
  accordance with AFI 11-2E-3, Volume 3, ACCR 55-20, and other governing directives.
  Although the surveillance section is primarily responsible for this activity, the weapons
  section will assist, to the maximum extent possible, in detecting tracks originating in non-
  friendly territory and inbound radar-only tracks. The ASO or SST will establish and
  maintain contact with ―Cuechalk‖ on the Data Link Coordination Net (UHF) to establish link
  entry procedures and link status. The ASO/SST will contact the MCRC on the Surveillance
  Coordination ROK Air Force (ROKAF )/ AWACS voice tell net to coordinate and conduct
  voice tell and surveillance point-outs. During peacetime, voice tell will be conducted with
  ground agencies for at least 30 minutes per agency (crew manning and time permitting).
     A16.5.3.1. (Added-18WG) Erratic Data Link Performance. When data links are
     inoperative, voice-tell will be performed with the MCRC for the entire time the E-3 is on-
     station. ASO/CSO/CT/SST will document problem symptoms and troubleshooting
     procedures implemented in the lessons learned.
     A16.5.3.2. (Added-18WG) Priority Tracks. The ASO/SST will hard copy tabular
     displays (TDs) of all non-friendly tracks that may be of intelligence interest at 1-3 minute
     intervals (based on maneuvers), as long as the track remains in the system. If the line
     printer is broken the tracks will be logged.
     A16.5.3.3. (Added-18WG) Training Procedures. During peacetime, simulation may be
     conducted during on-station. The MCC will determine live mission requirements
     adequate to cover any contingencies. Priority will always be given to real-world mission
     surveillance. The SD will notify the ASO/MCC when simulated tracks are put in the
     system. No simulated tracks will be initiated over Korea or the surveillance AOI. For
     training purposes, the E-3 may assume tracking for the entire Korean peninsula. During
     such training, the data link picture will not be forwarded to the MCRC. Voice-tell
     procedures will be in accordance with ACCR 55-43. The ASO will notify the SD/MCC
     whenever simulated tracks are put in the system. No simulated tracks will be initiated
     over Korea or the surveillance AOI. Simulation will not be conducted while executing
     ‖deep look‖ routing.
  A16.5.4. (Added-18WG) Electronic Support Procedures. ECOs will conduct ES operations
  in accordance with AFTTP 3-3, Air Force Tactics Techniques, and procedures. AWACS,
  7AF Special Instructions (SPINS), and other governing directives. Initial coordination with
 130                                       AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


   ―KRC OSAN‖ or ―Booster‖ will be accomplished prior to reaching Cheju Island (ROK).
   ECOs will always monitor the HVAA (PTN) SATCOM frequency. Emitter parametric data
   (J14.0) will not be passed over Link-16 or Link-11 (LOB data only) unless coordinated and
   approved by ―Keyboard.‖ ECOs will pass electronic intelligence (ELINT) data to other
   airborne intelligence/surveillance/ reconnaissance (ISR) or C2 via a voice product net (VPN)
   in the form of ―echo‖ series TACREPs when required criteria are met. VPN frequencies will
   be used in accordance with 7AF SPINS. To maintain maximum situational awareness and E-
   3 self-defense while PDS is operational, ECOs will refrain from assuming E-3 monitor duties
   except for an emergency situation.
   A16.5.5. (Added-18WG) Weapons Procedures. Control will be conducted in accordance
   with AFI 11-2E-3, Volume 3, AFI 11-214, Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
   (AFTTP) 3-1, ACCR 55-3, 55-43. The weapons section will assist the surveillance section,
   to the maximum extent possible, in detecting tracks originating in non-friendly territory and
   inbound radar-only tracks.
       A16.5.5.1. (Added-18WG) Contact with ―Cobra‖. The SD will establish and maintain
       contact with ―Cobra‖ on the UHF C2 weapons coordination net. The SD will conduct a
       correlation check prior to controlling aircraft. The SD will conduct a C2 situation brief
       [‖hot‖ areas, Airfield Advisories (AIRADS), control responsibilities, etc.] with the
       ―Cobra‖ SD. All tactical level coordination will be conducted on this frequency. The SD
       will brief the NAV / MCC on ―hot‖ areas and AIRADS as soon as possible. The SD will
       obtain ―hot‖ areas and AIRADS updates anytime the E-3 is transiting to and from the
       orbit and will brief the NAV/MCC.
       A16.5.5.2. (Added-18WG) Mode 4 Check. The SD will ensure that Mode 4 checks are
       accomplished on all controlled USAF aircraft (on flight lead in multiple-ship formations
       as a minimum) and results reported in accordance with AFI 11-214.
A16.6. (Added-18WG) Off-Station Procedures.
   A16.6.1. (Added-18WG) Reporting Procedures. The MCC will report off-station time to
   ―Keyboard‖ and/or ‖Cobra‖. When activated, ―Keyboard‖ will require an off-station report
   in accordance with 18 OG Form 49 via secure means.
   A16.6.2. (Added-18WG) Maintenance Codes and Additional Communication. The CSO
   will pass maintenance codes when practical or when within UHF range of Keystone.
   A16.6.3. (Added-18WG) Debriefing. An intelligence representative should be available to
   debrief KTACS missions. The ASO/ECO will collect and organize all hardcopies, logs, and
   emitters of interest as required for their particular debriefings.
AFI11-2E-3V3_18WGSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                       131

               DIVERSION CARD KADENA AREA DIVERT AIRFIELDS

Note: This chart is a guide for fuel planning. BINGO fuel should be computed based on actual
conditions the day of flight. The IAF FUEL listed below is fuel required from the Kadena IAF
to make one approach and climb out, and arrive overhead the divert base with 18,000 pounds.
Calculations were made using NO WIND and an operating weight of 183,000 pounds. Strong
winds associated with the Pacific jet stream can cause large changes in time and fuel
requirements. MC is the magnetic course from Kadena direct to the airfield. For ―on island
BINGO‖ required IAF fuel for Kadena AB is 24,000 pounds dual-runway ops and 33,000
pounds single-runway ops. Fuel required for transit to MCAS Futenma or Naha AB is 3,000
pounds.
