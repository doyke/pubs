This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 31-401, Information Security, and pro-
vides guidance from DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program; AFI 31-401, Information Security
Program Management and USAFEPAM 31-402, Conducting Security Incident Inquiries and Investiga-
tions. This instruction provides guidance on implementing an effective information security program
within the 401 AEW staff and all subordinate units. 401 AEW units will send proposed changes and cor-
rections to this publication to the 401 AEW/CCEA for review and inclusion. Maintain and dispose of
records created as a result of prescribed processes in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN)
37-139, Records Disposition Schedule.


1. POLICY:
   1.1. All 401 AEW staff members must be personally responsible for providing proper protection of
   the classified information within their respective custody.
       1.1.1. With the exception of Sarajevo, all detachments posses classified capability in one form or
       another and will handle and process classified information according to established regulatory
       guidance.
   1.2. All officials within the 401 AEW have specific, non-delegable responsibilities for implementa-
   tion and management of Information Security Programs within their units. Our presence in a foreign
   country and our peacekeeping mission present increased security risks; all unit members will give
   utmost care and attention to classified information to ensure it is protected.
   1.3. Classified information will be protected at all times, either by storage in a GSA approved con-
   tainer or facility, or by the personal observation and control of an authorized individual.

2. PROCEDURES:
2                                                                 401AEWI31-401 20 FEBRUARY 2004


    2.1. The 401 AEW Staff and each unit within the 401 AEW will appoint, in writing, an Information
    Security Program Manager (Attachment 2). Each unit Security Manager will keep signed copies of
    Attachment 2 on file. It is his/her responsibility to ensure all deployed persons are fully aware of
    proper procedures for custody and care of classified information. Unit commanders and Security
    Managers will ensure that the security inprocessing briefing (Attachment 1) is provided to all incom-
    ing personnel. Furthermore, the Program Manager will ensure proper procedures are followed in the
    event of a compromise of classified information.
    2.2. Unit commanders shall permit classified information access only if individuals, (1) possess a
    valid and appropriate security clearance, (2) have signed the appropriate non-disclosure agreement,
    and (3) have a valid need for access to information in order to perform a lawful and authorized gov-
    ernment function. Everyone bears responsibility to ensure that these requirements are met.
    2.3. 401 AEW units shall have a system of control measures that ensures access to classified informa-
    tion is limited to authorized personnel. Control measures shall be appropriate for both the environ-
    ment where access occurs and the nature and volume of information. The system shall include
    technical, physical and personal control measures. Administrative control measures (which may
    include records of internal distribution, access, generation, inventory, reproduction and disposition)
    shall be required when technical, physical and personal control measures are insufficient to detect
    and/or deter access by unauthorized persons.
    2.4. Classified information, discussed in telephone conversations or over computer information sys-
    tems, must be discussed only over secure communication circuits approved for transmission of infor-
    mation at the specific level of classification.
    2.5. Meetings and conferences involving classified information present special vulnerabilities to
    unauthorized disclosure. Adequate security procedures to minimize risk to classified information
    must be developed and implemented. Classified sessions will be segregated whenever possible.
    Access to meetings, conferences or specific sessions at which classified information will be discussed
    or disseminated will be limited to persons who possess an appropriate security clearance and
    need-to-know.
    2.6. Commanders will establish procedures to ensure prompt and appropriate management actions are
    taken in case of (1) compromise or potential compromise of classified information, (2) improper clas-
    sification of information, (3) violation of the provisions of this operation instruction and, (4) for inci-
    dents that may put classified information at risk of compromise.
       2.6.1. Any person who becomes aware of the possible compromise of classified information will
       immediately report it to their supervisor or the unit security manger. If the person believes that the
       immediate supervisor or security manager may have been involved in the incident, he/she may
       report it to authorities at the next level of command or supervision. Unit commanders will advise
       401 AEW/CC and 401 AEW/IM as soon as possible when there is a security incident.
       2.6.2. If a compromise occurs, damage to U.S. interests will be determined and appropriate mea-
       sures taken to negate or minimize the adverse effect of such compromise. When possible, action
       should be taken to regain custody of documents or material that was compromised.
           2.6.2.1. The unit commander will initiate an investigation by appointing an investigating offi-
           cial. The investigating official will immediately inquire into the incident to determine when,
           where and how it occurred, and if classified information was compromised.

        2.6.2.2. For information on how to conduct an inquiry or formal investigation consult
        USAFEPAM 31-402, Conducting Security Incident inquiries and Investigations. This pam-
        phlet explains who to notify and provides guidance on whether to conduct an inquiry or a for-
        mal investigation and how to conduct them. Given the transitory nature of personnel within the
        401 AEW, it is imperative that inquiries are completed expeditiously.
        2.6.2.3. Action will be taken to identify the source and reason for actual or potential compro-
        mise and remedial action taken to prevent recurrence.
        2.6.2.4. All 401 AEW personnel must understand that they are subject to sanctions if they
        knowingly, willfully, or negligently disclose classified information to unauthorized personnel.
        Sanctions include, but are not limited to, warning, reprimand, suspension without pay, forfei-
        ture of pay, removal, discharge, and loss or denial of access to classified information. UCMJ
        action may also be taken for violations of the code and any applicable criminal law.
