AFGSC.
1. Heliport Facilities
     1.1. Heliport facilities must permit safe, efficient and effective heliport operations.
     1.2. The HMA is the term used to identify the areas where helicopters routinely park,
     perform takeoffs, landings, hovering maneuvers and taxi operations.
     1.3. The HMA (Figure 1) is as depicted below, and is outlined by orange barriers and
     concrete barriers. It includes a controlled area which is the ramp area and hangar. It does not
     overlap the gravel driving course.
     1.4. The helicopter parking area is defined by painted spots numbered 1 through 8. The
     helipad on the ramp is designated as “Pedro”. The helipad located on the grass infield is
     “Jolly”. The designated slide area is a portion of the closed runway between taxiway Romeo
     and Quebec. The grass area southeast and parallel to the slide area is designated as the grass
     slide area. Crosswind practice autorotations or other crosswind slides must be accomplished
     at an appropriate runway at Great Falls International (GTF).

   1.5. Drop Zone Charlie is a parachute landing zone that covers a large portion of the HMA.
   The Red Horse Squadron will coordinate the use of Drop Zone Charlie through 40 HS/DOO
   who will then ensure that all drop zone operations and HMA operations are deconflicted with
   helicopter operations and that Notices to Airmen (NOTAM) are properly issued.
   1.6. The 40 HS/ODO monitors the HMA from Blade Operations. Any unusual condition on
   the heliport that may adversely impact the safety of helicopter operations will be immediately
   reported to Blade Operations. Blade Operations may be contacted via landline (ext. 3250) or
   by radio (LMR Frequency A Blade Ops or UHF Frequency 271.9). The 40 HS/ODO will
   immediately notify the 40 HS/DO and 341 MW/SEF. 341 MW/SEF will coordinate to
   eliminate the hazard. The 40 HS/DO will determine the immediate actions to be taken
   concerning flight operations based on an assessment of the risk and the nature of the hazard.
2. Duties and Responsibilities
   2.1. 40 HS/Heliport Manager (HM) is responsible for the overall management of the heliport
   and facilities and for Malmstrom Heliport (KGFA) NOTAMs .
       2.1.1. 40HS/ODO will be the focal point for reporting HMA issues. The ODO will
       funnel information back to 40HS/DOO, 40HS/HM, 40HS/DO, 40HS/SE and
       341MW/SEF.
   2.2. The 341MW/SEF and 40HS/HM should perform monthly heliport inspections in
   accordance with Attachment 1. The areas inspected will include, but are not limited to:
   helipads, ramp and parking areas, the runway, grass slide area, ramp and slide area markings,
   HMA signs, heliport lighting, barriers, windsocks and obstacles.
   2.3. The DO will also ensure all Prior Permission Required (PPR) requests are coordinated
   for transient aircraft. The wing FSO should be notified of all transient aircraft requests that
   are approved.
   2.4. 341 CES is responsible for the maintenance of all helipads, ramp areas, the runway and
   all grass areas in and around the HMA. They will remove snow and ice when appropriate,
   will sweep the HMA weekly, keep the grass cut from 7 to 14 inches in accordance with
   AFI 91202 and will maintain all heliport lighting.
       2.4.1. The community planner, 341 CES Base Development Element, is the central point
       of contact for heliport management within the Civil Engineering Squadron.
       2.4.2. The community planner will ensure that work requests comply with all 32series
       instructions, coordinate all work orders pertaining to the airfield, maintain the airfield
       obstruction waiver file and Etabs and validate and process airfield obstruction waiver
       requests.
   2.5. 341 CS will maintain the crash phones and the response talk group. The UHF radio will
   be maintained by 341 CS/SCOT.
   2.6. Law Enforcement will frequently patrol the border of the HMA, train all patrols on the
   rules of the HMA, and respond to HMA violations/incursions reported from Blade
   Operations with urgency. Ensure all patrols maintain a government issued drivers license.
   Law Enforcement will provide the offenders names to 40 HS/ODO. 40 HS/ODO will pass
   this information to 40 HS/HM, DO, SE, and 341MW/SE respectively.
 4                                                               341MWI13-213 21 MAY 2010


     2.7. 341 MW/CC is the final approval authority for changes to procedures in this instruction.
3. Heliport Use and Safety
     3.1. The heliport is routinely used by the 40 HS. Other base agencies and units outside the
     341 MW may request to use the heliport landing areas, portions of the closed runway or the
     HMA. Authority for approval rests with the 40HS/DO.
        3.1.1. PPR requests from transient aircraft will be coordinated by the 40 HS according to
        paragraph 2.3. Any transient aircraft wishing to use the heliport for other than full stop
        landings, passenger pickup and drop off, and take-offs for departure must get the
        approval of 40 HS/DO. 40 HS/SE will be notified prior to the event/operation and should
        inform 341 MW/SEF.
        3.1.2. Agencies or units requesting to use the HMA or any portion of the closed runway
        for nonaviation related activities will coordinate through 40 HS/DO. 40 HS/DO should
        inform 40 HS/HM and 40 HS/SE to further coordinate with requestor.
     3.2. The 40 HS/HM will coordinate requests for Drop Zone Charlie.
4. Heliport Management Committee
     4.1. The Heliport Management Committee (HMC) will consist of: 341 OG/CC or a
     designated representative, 40 HS/DO, 40 HS/HM, 341 MW/SEF, 40 HS/CC, 40 HS/SEF and
     341 CES. The HMC will meet semiannually or more frequently if required.
     4.2. The HMC will address issues pertinent to the heliport to include, but not limited to:
     heliport construction, heliport maintenance, grass cutting, snow removal, FOD prevention,
     any hazards near the heliport or HMA that may affect operations and any special use
     requests.
     4.3. All base construction plans must be approved by the HMC. The HMC will perform a
     risk assessment on any project or activity that may pose a hazard to heliport operations.
     Attendance of the 40 HS heliport manager and 341 MW/SEF at a facilities use board meeting
     will satisfy this requirement. New construction must comply with heliport design criteria
     found in UFC 3-260-01. If compliance cannot be achieved, a waiver must be approved by
     AFSPC/A7 before construction can begin.
5. Helicopter Movement Area and Vehicle Access
     5.1. The use of motor vehicles on the HMA may be necessary for normal operations and
     maintenance. Anyone operating a vehicle in the HMA must have a legitimate reason for
     specific access to this area. Using these areas as a thoroughfare for convenience or to save
     time/mileage is strictly prohibited. If the goal or destination of the party on board is not
     within the HMA, or the purpose of travel is not to perform duties in support of the heliport,
     the vehicle does not have a legitimate reason to access the HMA. The HMA is depicted in
     Figure 1.
     5.2. Motor vehicle traffic in the HMA is restricted to Government Motor Vehicles, 40 HS
     squadron members, and other preapproved vehicles.
     5.3. Exceptions to paragraph 5.2 require written authorization by 40 HS/DO, 40 HS/HM, or
     40 HS/SE.
341MWI13-213 21 MAY 2010                                                                       5


   5.4. The 40 HS/ODO monitors the HMA from Blade Operations and will grant access to
   motor vehicles for legitimate purposes. Blade Operations may be contacted via landline
   (ext. 3250) or by radio (LMR Frequency A Blade Ops or UHF Frequency 271.9). Approvals
   are required and granted for specific times or windows of time. Access clearance expires
   once the vehicle departs the HMA. Another clearance must be granted to reenter the HMA.
   Vehicles shall inform Blade Operations via radio or telephone when clear of the HMA.
      5.4.1. Fuel trucks receiving notification from helicopter maintenance for refueling
      constitutes clearance, but must remain clear of the landing areas.
      5.4.2. Vehicles responding to helicopter emergencies do not require prior permission.
      5.4.3. Helicopter maintenance personnel may operate unrestricted in the helicopter
      parking and movement area. Maintenance personnel will monitor Blade Ops radio for
      inbound aircraft.
      5.4.4. When Blade Operation is closed, contact base dispatch at ext. 3746 for approval to
      enter the HMA, or contact the 40 HS on call leadership through CP.
6. Prerequisites for Helicopter Movement Area Driving
   6.1. Squadron commanders assigning personnel to operate motor vehicles in the HMA must
   comply with the following:
      6.1.1. All drivers requiring access to the HMA must possess a valid state driver’s license
      or government drivers license.
          6.1.1.1. Also, they must contact the 341 MW/SEF to review the local area airfield
          driving slides.
      6.1.2. Only personnel necessary for mission accomplishment will be authorized to
      operate a motor vehicle in the HMA (this may include CE activities, SF, etc).
      6.1.3. Immediate supervisors will personally ascertain that their operators are physically,
      mentally and emotionally capable of performing assigned driving tasks.
      6.1.4. Appoint a unit trainer, usually the VCO, VNCO or the USR, to ensure that all
      HMA driving prerequisites are accomplished and properly tracked.
   6.2. 341 MW/SEF will provide updated roster of trained HMA drives to the 40 HS/HM.
7. Helicopter Movement Area Driving Procedures
   7.1. Vehicles will enter and exit at the entry points designated at the 1) southwest and 2)
   southeast side of the 3bay hangar or 3) the area of the ramp just southeast of the Red Horse
   Squadron storage yard, runway intersections with the HMA to 4) the North and 5) South, and
   6) the North edge of the ramp near the fire department. These entry points are illustrated in
   Figure 1.
   7.1.1. The person requesting permission must call blade operations on 271.9, FM Blade
   Ops network, or on extension 3250. They must state their position, reason for access,
   amount of time needed in the HMA and a contact number where they can be reached.
6                                                                  341MWI13-213 21 MAY 2010


       7.1.2. Example of radio/telephone requests for access to the HMA, e.g.: “BLADE OPS,
       SAFETY MOBILE AT ENTRY POINT 3, REQUEST PERMISSION ONTO THE HMA
       FOR 45 MINUTES.”
       “SAFETY MOBILE, BLADE OPS HOLD SHORT OF HMA or PROCEED ONTO
       THE HMA, REPORT WHEN OFF.”
       7.1.3. The 40 HS/ODO will give permission to access the HMA.
    7.2. Prior to traveling onto the HMA, drivers will stop at the entry point and ensure the area
    and surrounding airspace is clear of helicopter traffic.
       7.2.1. Helicopters always have the right-of-way. Vehicles not directly supporting ground
       operations or servicing will remain a minimum of 100 feet from operating helicopters
       (rotors not tied down) and clear of the intended flight path, and 50 feet from parked
       helicopters (rotors tied down).
       7.2.2. Never approach a running helicopter from the rear. Remain in front or to the side
       of the helicopter whenever possible.
       7.2.3. Drivers will plan routes on the HMA to avoid the taxi routes, helipads and landing
       areas to the maximum extent practical to preclude impacting hover, taxi and landing
       operations.
    7.3. Speed Limits:
       7.3.1. General Purpose Vehicles – 15 MPH
       7.3.2. Special Purpose Vehicles – 10 MPH
       7.3.3. All vehicles are restricted to 5 MPH within 50 feet of helicopters.
       7.3.4. Vehicles operating on the closed runway may operate at speeds up to 25 MPH.
       7.3.5. Emergency response vehicles responding to an aircraft or ground emergency
       within the HMA may exceed the speed limit if the situation dictates.
       7.3.6. Snow removal equipment may be driven at the recommended speeds to
       accomplish snow and ice removal.
    7.4. Drivers will not direct headlights to the front of an operating helicopter at night. The
    lights severely degrade the crew’s night vision capability. When operating on the HMA at
    night, always position the vehicle well clear of the helicopter and its taxi route. If the vehicle
    is positioned such that the headlights are directed at the helicopter, turn off the vehicle’s
    headlights and turn on the hazard lights until the helicopter has passed and will not be
    affected by the headlight beams.
    7.5. All vehicles will approach a helicopter with the driver’s side of the vehicle toward the
    front of the helicopter. Do not back a vehicle toward a helicopter unless a spotter is posted
    and a chock is positioned to preclude backing into the helicopter.
    7.6. When parking a vehicle on the HMA in other than designated parking areas and leaving
    the driver’s seat unattended, the following applies:
       7.6.1. Engine will be turned off. NOTE: Emergency or servicing vehicles may leave the
       engine running provided chocks and hand brake/parking brake are used.
341MWI13-213 21 MAY 2010                                                                              7


       7.6.2. Select reverse (standard) or park (automatic) if the engine is to be turned off or
       neutral if the engine will remain on.
       7.6.3. Set the parking or hand brake.
       7.6.4. Chocks will be used to secure all wheeled equipment that does not have an integral
       braking system or other times specified in this instruction. Chocks will be used during all
       refueling operations.
       7.6.5. Hazard lights or parking lights will be turned on during periods of darkness or
       limited visibility.
       7.6.6. Vehicles will remain unlocked with the keys in the ignition.
   7.7. Lateral distance requirements for fixed and mobile obstacles (vehicles, AGE, etc…).
       7.7.1. Vehicles and equipment will not be parked or left unattended within 400 feet of
       the Pedro or Jolly helipad (distance based on clear zone requirement in UFC 3-260-01,
       Table 4-2, Items 6 and 7).
       7.7.2. No unauthorized person shall be allowed to approach within 50 feet of a helicopter
       when the rotor blades are turning (AFOSHSTD 91-100, 1.2.16.9.3.).
       7.7.3. All vehicles should remain at least 100 feet away from helicopters with blades
       turning.
8. Helicopter Movement Area Driving Violations and Incursions
   8.1. An HMA violation is any negligent or willful act committed by an authorized HMA
   driver that violates the directives set forth in this publication or violates the safety of aircraft,
   personnel or equipment.
   8.2. An HMA incursion is any unauthorized movement or entry onto the HMA. Incursions
   present potential hazards to aircraft and personnel operating legitimately in this area.
   8.3. Violations and incursions will be reported to Blade Operations as soon as possible after
   the event. Blade Operations will immediately submit pertinent information to flight safety
   who will fill out an AF IMT 457, USAF Hazard Report, for violations/incursions that do
   not impact helicopter operations, or an AF IMT 651, USAF Hazardous Air Traffic Report,
   for violations/incursions that do impact helicopter operations. The information in
   Attachment 3 will be used as a guide in filling out the appropriate form, and forms will be
   submitted through the 40 HS/SE to the 341 MW/SEF for follow up. These actions are time
   critical so corrective action can be taken immediately. Blade Operations will avoid
   unnecessary delays in notifying 40 HS/SE.
   8.4. 341 MW/SEF will investigate allegations of a violation or incursion and collect the facts
   surrounding the event. The 341 MW/SEF will submit the facts to the offender’s unit
   commander. The unit commander will forward a recommendation to the installation
   commander for consideration and final action. Potential actions for these offenses follow:
       8.4.1. For an HMA violation:
           8.4.1.1. First offense – Suspension of HMA driving privileges for 1 week and
           retraining.
