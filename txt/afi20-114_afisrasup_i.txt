1. Overview. Note: There are two categories of assets associated with the structural enterprise:
facilities (e.g., buildings, utilities infrastructure, and real property installed equipment as defined
in AFI 32-9005, Use of Real Property Facilities) and non-facilities air and space equipment (e.g.,
aircraft/missiles and associated subsystems, support equipment and components). This
publication only addresses requirements and responsibilities for non-facilities AF air and space
equipment.
     1.1. Objective. The objective of effective structural management is to optimize safety,
     serviceability and readiness throughout the life cycle of air and space equipment. Structural
     management, as addressed in this publication, refers to activities associated with
     requirements development, design, maintenance, and integrity monitoring-assessment of air
     and space physical structural equipment. Activities acquiring air and space assets are to
     strive for design and select material/coatings, while balancing cost and performance, to
     minimize structural degradation. Structural management includes structural material
     technology (including coatings) and structural integrity of aircraft (manned and unmanned)
     and non-aircraft. Note: Refer to AFI 63-1201, Life Cycle Systems Engineering, for guidance
     on non-facilities integrity programs. Structural sustainment disciplines directly involve
     AFSC 2A7XX and equivalent civilian workforce.

  2.1. General. This publication addresses management oversight for the structural
  disciplines of: Advanced Composites (AC), Coatings Technology Integration (CTI),
  Corrosion Prevention and Control (CPC), Low Observables Supportability (LOS), Metals
  Technology (MT), and Nondestructive Inspection (NDI).
  2.2. Descriptions of Disciplines. Structural disciplines as referred to in this publication are:
     2.2.1. Advanced Composites is the use of advanced composites, materials consisting of
     two or more distinct components.
     2.2.2. Coatings Technology Integration is the testing, evaluation, characterization, and
     qualification of organic/inorganic coating systems. It includes the equipment and
     processes associated with the application, removal, and maintenance of coating systems.
     Note: “Organic” refers to chemical compounds chiefly composed of carbon, hydrogen
     and oxygen in a multitude of molecular arrangements. “Organic coating” refers to a
     coating or paint that is a carbon based liquid or semi-liquid material, and is applied to a
     surface by some mechanical means and which, when dried or cured, will provide an
     adherent film of certain desired characteristics. (Additional detail is contained in TO 1-1-
     8, Application and Removal of Organic Coatings, Air and Space and Non-Air and Space
     Equipment.)
     2.2.3. Corrosion Prevention and Control is the prevention, assessment, detection and
     control of damage and effects of corrosion to ensure structural integrity of systems and
     associated supporting equipment and components.
     2.2.4. Low Observables are the technologies to control the radar, infrared, visual and
     acoustic signatures for reducing threat sensor detection.
     2.2.5. Metals Technology is the involvement of measurement, inspection (visual/optical),
     repair, manufacture, fabrication, heat treatment, welding and testing of metal parts for
     aircraft, equipment, components and tools.
     2.2.6. Nondestructive Inspection is the inspection of a structure or component that will
     detect flaws, measure geometric characteristics, determine material structure or
     composition or characterize physical, electrical or thermal properties without causing
     changes in the part or impairing future usefulness.
