          The Inspector General Complaint System (AFI 90-301)
You have the right to communicate with the IG without reprisal, but use the chain of command and give
your unit a chance to help first! Although the following steps are not required before talking to the IG,
         experience has shown that supervisors and commanders can best resolve complaints.
