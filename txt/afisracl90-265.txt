SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision contains administrative changes, to include organizational name changes and minor
reference changes. This publication should also be used as a self-inspection checklist.
1. General. The items listed do not constitute the order or limit the scope of the
inspection/assessment. As a minimum, units should use these directives in conjunction with the
annual Unit Self-Assessment. The objective is to identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of
required capabilities. Units can supplement this publication to add internal compliance items.
This directive may be used in whole or in part by HHQ during visits or exercises. Users may add
any items(s), which, in the exercise of good judgment, requires examination.
     1.1. Critical Compliance Objectives (CCO). Items defined by the AFISRA staff as key
     result areas for successful mission accomplishment include, but are not limited to, items
     where non-compliance could result in serious injury, loss of life, excessive cost, or litigation.
     Critical Compliance Objectives are shown in BOLD AND ALL CAPS FORMAT (Table
     1.1).
     1.2. Core Compliance Items (CCI). Areas that require special vigilance and are important
     to the overall performance of the unit, but are not deemed "Critical." Non-compliance would
     result in some negative impact on mission performance or could result in injury, unnecessary
     cost, or possible litigation. Core Compliance Items are shown in ALL CAPS FORMAT
     (Table 1.1).
     1.3. General Compliance Items (GCI). Areas deemed fundamental to successful overall
     performance of the unit, but non-compliance would result in minimal impact on mission
     accomplishment or would be unlikely to result in injury, increased cost, or possible litigation.
     General Compliance Items are shown in sentence case format (Table 1.1).

Table 1.1. Financial Management Program.
