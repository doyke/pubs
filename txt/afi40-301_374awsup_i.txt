   immediately notified and will ascertain from the victim, whether the report will be restricted or unre-
   stricted.
      1.6.5.1. (Added-374AW) Restricted Reporting: The Department of Defense (DoD) has directed
      the implementation of confidentiality in the form of a restricted reporting option that enables mil-
      itary members to report allegations of sexual assault to specified personnel, without triggering an
      investigation. This reporting option gives the individual access to medical care, counseling and a
      Victim Advocate (VA) but does not initiate the investigative process. The option of restricted
      reporting was effective after 14 June 2005. Any reports of sexual assault received by SARCs or
      others who would be authorized to receive restricted reports before 14 June 2005 were not treated
      as confidential within the terms of this policy. This policy supercedes all regulatory and policy
      guidance within the Department of the Air Force not expressly mandated by law that is inconsis-
      tent with its provisions or would preclude its full implementation. OPRs of Air Force publications
      (particularly in the 31, 36, 39, 40’s, 51, 71 and 90 series) should immediately review their publi-
      cations to ensure that required modifications are completed.

      normal reporting channels, including the victim’s chain of command, law enforcement and the Air
      Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) or other criminal investigative service is consid-
      ered an unrestricted report. A report made to a SARC or a healthcare provider under circum-
      stances where it cannot reasonably be ascertained whether it is intended as a restricted report will
      be treated as a restricted report until the SARC can ascertain the victim’s intentions. The SARC
      will be notified of any unrestricted report and will assign a VA to the individual. Details of the
      allegation will be provided only to those personnel who have a legitimate need to know.
          1.6.5.2.1. (Added-374AW) Notify the LSSC (if during normal duty hours) or the on-call
          LSSC provider (if after normal duty hours or on holidays or weekends). Provider will respond
          at victim’s request.
          1.6.5.2.2. (Added-374AW) The investigative agency will collaborate with the physician and
          advise regarding forensic needs. A provider will conduct a physical exam IAW established
          guidelines and procedures.

               PROGRAM STRUCTURE AND ADMINISTRATION OVERVIEW

2.1. The Family Advocacy Program. The Air Force FAP is a medical program that enhances Air Force
readiness by promoting family and community health and resilience and advocating for nonviolent com-
munities. The FAP helps build and sustain healthy communities by developing, implementing, and eval-
uating programs and policies designed to prevent and treat child and spouse maltreatment. The FAP
provides program management, oversight, expert training, and consultation services to its key customers
and maintains, analyzes, and reports data on child and spouse maltreatment. In concert with installation
and community agencies, the Air Force FAP provides a continuum of services designed to build commu-
nity health and resiliency. The FAP facilitates family, community, and mission readiness.

2.2. Program Components. The FAP is comprised of three principal components: prevention services,
maltreatment intervention, and research and evaluation.
   2.2.1. Prevention: The installation FAP prevention team will collaborate with key community lead-
   ers, the Integrated Delivery System (IDS) and other helping agencies to provide services that enhance
   the resilience of Air Force communities and reduce the incidence of family maltreatment. Programs
   are directed toward community organization and provision of prevention services. FAP prevention
   services include Outreach, The New Parent Support Program (NPSP), and on a space available basis,
   Family Advocacy Strength-based Therapy (FAST) Services. FAP Outreach is designed to coordinate
   and implement primary and secondary prevention services that include education and skill develop-
   ment, advocacy, collaboration, community intervention, referral links to community resources, and
   marketing the FAP. The NPSP provides nursing services and home-based education and support ser-
   vices to families with children ages’ birth to three years, including the prenatal period. NPSP services
   focus on parents’ strengths and are provided in a manner sensitive to cultural differences. FAST
   services offers brief intervention and support to couples and families outside the scope of NPSP.
   2.2.2. Maltreatment Intervention: Through the installation FAP, the Air Force provides and/or coor-
   dinates identification, assessment, intervention, and case management services to all eligible benefi-
   ciaries experiencing problems with family maltreatment. FAP providers will collaborate with
   community resources and the various management teams.
   2.2.3. Research and Evaluation: FAP sponsors system-wide research and evaluation of prevention
   and intervention services. Research projects are conducted through collaborative partnerships with
   prominent domestic violence and child maltreatment researchers who understand the unique needs of
   military families. Projects are selected based on their potential to inform FAP prevention, outreach,
   and intervention practice. The Central Registry staff maintains a database on maltreatment cases. Sta-
   tistical reports are generated from data collected from the Central Registry to assess the impact of
   intervention services.

2.3. Additional Administrative Elements. To ensure program effectiveness, the following key features
will exist as a part of each installation FAP:
   2.3.1. A FAP Installation Directive (Supplement to AFI 40-301) and MTF operating instructions for
   implementation of the FAP considering local policies and circumstances unique to that area. All first
   responder agencies and medical personnel should coordinate on these documents, which include cli-
18                                                             AFI40-301_374AWSUP_I 15 JUNE 2007


     ent-focused processes, directed toward preventing, identifying, assessing, and providing intervention
     for child and spouse maltreatment.
     2.3.2. A FAP Action Plan developed by the FAO and FAP staff, which includes a FAP Marketing
     Plan. The FAP Action Plan will be approved and monitored by the FAC.
     2.3.3. MOUs, developed between FAP and key civilian agencies, such as civilian child protective ser-
     vices and victim advocacy services that increase the safety of service members and their families, and
     enhance access to community resources.
     2.3.4. A duress system and written office safety policy, which include both the FAP office and
     home-visit environments.
     2.3.5. FAP records created for each family involved in family maltreatment, and clinical secondary
     prevention activities requiring documentation. These records will be maintained IAW FAP Standards.
     2.3.6. DOD Confidentiality Policy will be briefed at all training sessions.
     2.3.7. Electronic data submitted to AFMSA/SGOF using the Family Advocacy System of Records
     (FASOR) and FAPNET for NPSP and the Outreach Prevention Automated Log (OPAL).

2.4. Civilian Family Advocacy Staff. AFMSA/SGOF uses congressional funds allocated for maltreat-
ment intervention and prevention services to provide civilian staffing for FAP. The staff may be hired
through the civilian personnel system or personal services contract. Civilian FAP staff will not provide
special needs assignment coordination services, but will offer maltreatment intervention and prevention
services to special needs families. All FAP staff are involved in providing maltreatment prevention ser-
vices.
     2.4.1. Civilian Staff: The FAO supervises all civilian Family Advocacy staff. See the AF FAP Stan-
     dards for the role of each staff member. AFMSA/SGOF manages the authorization and funding of
     these positions. The resources for these positions come from a special congressional authorization to
     prevent and treat family maltreatment in the military. The FAO must notify AFMSA/SGOF when a
     civilian position (civil service or contract) becomes vacant. No hiring action can be taken until refill
     of the position is authorized by AFMSA/SGOF.
     2.4.2. AFMSA/SGOF-funded Civilian Employees: Civilian employees whose positions are funded
     by AFMSA/SGOF cannot participate in any after-hours “on-call” duties or serve as the FAO, alternate
     FAO, acting FAO, or Special Needs Coordinator unless specifically authorized by AFMSA/SGOF via
     a memorandum of understanding between AFMSA/SGOF and the MTF.
     2.4.3. Civilian Providers of FAP Clinical Services: The Family Advocacy Treatment Manager
     (FATM) and the Family Advocacy Intervention Specialist (FAIS) are the only AFMSA-funded civil-
     ian staff who are privileged by the MTF to provide independent clinical services. Family Advocacy
     Nurses (FAN) will maintain a current copy of their state license with the MTF and can practice the full
     range of FAP nursing services.
     2.4.4. Civilian Providers of FAP Outreach Services: All FAP services performed by the FAOM will
     be nonclinical and of a community organization focus. Therefore, FAOMs will not be allowed to
     acquire privileges, so as to function solely as key facilitator and coordinator for FAP marketing and
     community prevention services.

  2.4.5. DOD funded victim advocates do not provide clinical services. Advocates may provide support
  services for victims on or off the installation.
  2.4.6. IAW HQ USAF/SG guidance, non-DHP-funded staff will not enter patient activity into the
  Ambulatory Data System/CHCS.
  2.4.7. Limitations on New FAP Civilian Employees: While awaiting the outcome of background
  checks:
     2.4.7.1. Providers seeking regular privileges and awaiting background check results may work
     with all clients without direct line-of-sight supervision as long as appropriate professional super-
     vision is provided.
     2.4.7.2. FAP nurses may work with adult clients without direct line of sight supervision, and with
     minor clients (under 18 years of age) only when a parent/guardian is present.
     2.4.7.3. All other FAP employees will not work with minor clients until completion of a back-
     ground check.

                                                 Chapter 3

                                              PREVENTION

3.1. Policy Statement for FAP Community Prevention : The unique mission of FAP community pre-
vention is to facilitate the reduction in the number and severity of incidents of family maltreatment, with
an overarching goal to build healthy communities. Outreach is the FAP umbrella component that supports
all FAP programs and services and is the conduit for FAP prevention and community activity. The func-
tion of the Outreach component is structured through key Outreach domains and strategies: Advocacy,
Training, Education, Skills Development, Marketing, Resource Finding and Service Linking, Collabora-
tion, and Community Intervention. Through Outreach implementation, these domains and strategies
guide FAP prevention from theory to practice and support community competence on maltreatment
dynamics, reporting, and prevention. Under the direction of the FAO, the Family Advocacy Outreach
Manager (FAOM) leads the prevention team and facilitates and coordinates FAP prevention and commu-
nity initiatives utilizing this operational structure. The FAP prevention team is comprised of all FAP staff
and may be augmented with members from other military and civilian agencies.
     3.1.1. All FAP services, activities, and collaborative initiatives support community cohesion and pro-
     mote advocacy for nonviolent communities. The FAP team focuses prevention program planning,
     development, implementation, and service delivery on enhancing and building connections among
     formal and informal civilian and military leadership, agencies, and organizations. The goal of FAP
     prevention is to decrease behaviors that contribute to family maltreatment and enhance behaviors that
     foster a healthy lifestyle.

3.2. Prevention Program Planning.
     3.2.1. In prevention program planning and delivery, the FAP team will collaborate with Life Skills
     Support, and other MTF clinics and services, the installation Integrated Delivery System (IDS), instal-
     lation leaders, the Chaplain Service, and key community and military agencies.
     3.2.2. Community needs assessments are accomplished in collaboration with the installation IDS.
     The USAF Community Needs Assessment is a primary instrument, but additional assessments are uti-
     lized to further define installation community needs. Findings are incorporated into FAP prevention
     planning.
     3.2.3. The FAP team develops a FAP Action Plan, including a marketing plan, based on the most cur-
     rent assessment of community needs. The FAP Action Plan will be coordinated with the installation
     IDS.

3.3. Prevention Functions and Services.
     3.3.1. The FAP prevention team will develop and manage the FAP Prevention Program. The FAOM,
     as the prevention team leader and the key community liaison for FAP, is responsible for the coordina-
     tion and facilitation of the FAP Action Plan. While the primary responsibility lies with the FAOM, the
     FAP staff will take a team approach to the development, planning, and implementation of all preven-
     tion services, activities, and initiatives.
     3.3.2. The FAP coordinates with, and supports, the IDS. The FAOM is the IDS representative for
     FAP.

  FAP staff and IAW AF FAP and DOD guidelines. The FAN is the key facilitator for NPSP services.
  3.3.6. The FAP will provide annual education to all Commanders and First Sergeants, base human
  service agencies, Family Member Support Flight, Health Care Providers, Chaplains, FSC, SJA,
  AFOSI, SFS, and other key personnel on the dynamics of family maltreatment and identification and
  referral procedures.
  3.3.7. The FAP will educate unit Commanders, First Sergeants, and Command Chief Master Ser-
  geants on child and domestic abuse dynamics and protocols within 60 days of assuming these posi-
  tions and at least annually thereafter.

     service and/or contract), will not provide clinical intervention to sexual offenders to modify deviant
     sexual arousal patterns. These clients will be referred for such clinical intervention to specialists in the
     community. FAP and MTF personnel may provide other services to sex offenders as long as services
     do not focus on the deviant arousal patterns.
     4.2.10. Fatality reviews will be conducted on all death cases when family maltreatment is suspected.
     AFMSA/SGOF is responsible for coordinating the Air Force multidisciplinary fatality review team.

                                  DISPOSITION OF PERSONNEL

5.1. Special Duty. FAP involvement, by itself, does not require any duty restriction. For information
about how to assign personnel receiving FAP assistance while performing duties requiring either the Sen-
sitive Duty Programs, security clearance, access to classified information, or unescorted entry into
restricted areas, refer to AFI 36-2104, Nuclear Weapons Personnel Reliability Program, and AFI 31-501,
Personnel Security Program Management.

5.2. Review of Duty Assignment. Commanders must review the duty assignment status of all military
members whose current duties may make it difficult for them to receive Family Advocacy intervention .
Military members considered fit for duty may continue in their primary or control Air Force Specialty
Code (AFSC) while involved in FAP intervention, unless precluded under AFI 36-2101, Classifying Mil-
itary Personnel. If precluded, the commander may assign members under their secondary or tertiary
AFSC during the FAP intervention process.

5.3. Promotion and Retention of Personnel. A member's involvement in the FAP will not be the sole
basis for denying or withholding promotion or retention.

5.4. Assignment Availability. Family Maltreatment. Active duty members receiving intervention ser-
vices for family maltreatment who are sufficiently emotionally, psychologically, and physiologically sta-
ble can be assigned to any location that offers appropriate services. If maltreatment occurs in a family
with PCS orders, the unit commander will suspend the assignment until evaluations are completed to
ensure availability of services at the gaining base. AD members having an open maltreatment record at
the time they receive PCS orders for an overseas assignment should be processed as a family with special
needs for FAP services from the gaining MTF.
   5.4.1. (Added-374AW) Active duty members with open family advocacy maltreatment cases will
   have files transferred to gaining installations IAW guidelines established in the USAF FAP Standards,

Terms
Child—An unmarried person under the age of 18 who is eligible for care through a DoD medical
treatment program and for whom a parent, guardian, foster parent, caregiver, employee of a residential
facility or any staff person providing out-of-home care is legally responsible. The term “child” means a
biological child, adopted child, stepchild or foster child or ward. The term also includes an individual of
any age who is incapable of self-support because of a mental or physical incapacity and for whom care in
a military medical treatment program is authorized.

such as those listed below. Acts not listed, but of similar severity, are also eligible.


Berating, disparaging, humiliating child (or other similar behavior)
Threatening child (including, but not limited to, indicating/implying future physical harm, abandonment,
sexual assault)
Harming/abandoning - or indicating that alleged offender will harm/abandon - people/things that child
cares about, such as loved ones, pets, property (including exposing child to criteria meeting or
subthreshold spouse maltreatment)
Confining child (a means of punishment involving restriction of movement, as by tying a child’s arms or
legs together or binding a child to a chair, bed or other object or confining a child to an enclosed area
[such as a closet])

32                                                              AFI40-301_374AWSUP_I 15 JUNE 2007


If the above criteria are met, then significant impact on the child involving any of the following: 1) Psy-
chological harm, including either: a) more than inconsequential fear reaction; b) significant psychological
distress (Major Depressive Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Acute Stress Disorder or other psy-
chiatric disorders, at or near diagnostic thresholds) related to the act(s). 2) Reasonable potential for psy-
chological harm: a) the act (or pattern of acts) creates reasonable potential for the development of a
psychiatric disorder (at or near diagnostic thresholds) related to or exacerbated by, the act(s). The child’s
level of functioning and the risk and resilience factors present should be taken into consideration; b) the
act (or pattern of acts) carries a reasonable potential for significant disruption of the child’s physical, psy-
chological, cognitive or social development. 3) Stress-related somatic symptoms (related to or exacer-
bated by the acts) that significantly interfere with normal functioning.
Child Neglect—Egregious act(s) or omission(s) on the part of the child’s caregiver that deprives the child
of needed age-appropriate care: 1) Lack of supervision: Egregious absence or inattention. Child’s age and
level of functioning should be considered in making determination about level of supervision required.
Note: leaving children ten or older unattended in a vehicle for brief periods of time in a safe area DOES
NOT meet this criterion. 2) Exposure to physical hazards: Inattention to child’s safety by exposing child
to physical dangers (including, but not limited to, exposed wiring; broken glass; non-secured, loaded guns
in home; illegal drugs in home; dangerous or unhygienic pets; asking child to perform dangerous
activities; driving while intoxicated with child in vehicle). 3) Educational neglect: Knowingly allowing
the child to have extended or frequent absences from school, neglecting to enroll the child in some type of
home schooling or public or private education or preventing the child from attending school for other than
justifiable reasons (when education is compulsory by law). 4) Medical neglect: Refusal or failure to
provide appropriate, medically indicated health care (including, but not limited to, failure to obtain
appropriate medical, mental health, dental care) although the parent was financially able to do so or was
offered other means to do so. It includes withholding of medically indicated treatment for a child with
life-threatening conditions. 5) Deprivation of necessities: The failure to provide age-appropriate
nourishment, shelter and clothing. Includes non-organic failure to thrive (which must be determined by a
competent medical authority), a type of child neglect evidenced by an infant’s or young child’s failure to
adequately grow and develop to or above the third percentile in height and weight when no organic basis
for this deviation is found. 6) Abandonment: The caregiver is absent and does not intend to return or is
away from the home for more than 24 hours without having arranged for an appropriate surrogate
caregiver. No impact in category “B” criterion is necessary for abandonment to be deemed neglect. In
addition to meeting one of the above criteria, there must be significant impact on the child involving any
of the following:


More than inconsequential physical injury
Psychological harm, including either: a) Child’s more than inconsequential fear reaction; or b) significant
psychological distress (Major Depressive Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Acute Stress
Disorder or other psychiatric disorders, at or near diagnostic thresholds) related to or exacerbated by, the
act(s) or omission(s).
Stress-related somatic symptoms (related to or exacerbated by the acts) that significantly interfere with
normal functioning.
Reasonable potential for more than inconsequential physical injury given the act(s)/omission(s) and
child’s physical environment;
AFI40-301_374AWSUP_I 15 JUNE 2007                                                                            33


Reasonable potential for psychological harm: a) the act/omission (or pattern of acts/omissions) creates
reasonable potential for the development of a psychiatric disorder (at or near diagnostic thresholds). The
