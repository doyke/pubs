        procedures and is considered Unsafe.

Table 3.1. IFE Declaration: Unless otherwise directed in After Landing procedures (see chart
below), aircraft declaring an IFE will proceed to the Hot Cargo Pad (HCP). Aircraft landing on
Runway 36 will perform a left180-degree turn and back taxi to HCP. Taxiway Alpha de-arm
spot closest to the runway is designated as the alternate location for hung ordnance/unsafe gun
emergencies when HCP is not available. (See Attachments 3 and 4.) In all cases of hung guns
and/or forward firing ordnance, the aircraft will point in the least hazardous direction--toward the
water. Other aircraft are prohibited from taxiing in front of them. Actual hung gun safing
procedures are covered in paragraph 4.

  3.2. Preliminary Actions:
        3.2.1. When the tower is advised that an aircraft is landing with live hung/damaged
        ordnance (except chaff/flare, BDU-33s, 2.75 rockets TP, inert ordnance or training
        ordnance that do not contain any explosive component), tower will take actions in
        accordance with AFI 11-2F-16FV3, Chapter 8/8 FW Supplement 1, paragraph 8.8,
        Abnormal Procedures. The Fire Alarm Control Center (FACC) will notify 8th Security
        Forces Squadron, Security Forces Control Center (8 SFS/SFCC) to have security force
        personnel placed on standby in the event a cordon needs to be established. Maintenance
        Operation Center (MOC) will notify 8 MXS/MXMR for all jammed/hung guns. 8
        MXS/MXMR will be on standby until gun can be safed/cleared or they are called to
        render assistance.
        3.2.2. Aircraft landing with hung (secure) BDU-33, chaff/flare, or practice/inert training
        ordnance (excluding rockets) will proceed to the nearest EOR area (TWY “A” or TWY
        “E”) and park in the spot closest to the runway. If no IFE has been declared for any other
        situation, the EOR crew will safe the aircraft and normal taxi-back procedures will be
        followed. If munitions cannot be safed, the aircraft will be shut down and a ground
        emergency will be declared as applicable.

       3.2.3. Aircrew and all non-essential personnel must be evacuated to a safe distance
       (determined by the on-scene commander) if normal de-arm procedures are ineffective.
    3.3. Response/Personnel Requirements:
       3.3.1. NOTE: At no time will a tow vehicle be placed in front of any unsafe forward
       firing munitions.
       3.3.2. If no IFE or ground emergency, and in the de-arm area (Taxiway “A” or Taxiway
       “E”): One de-arm crew per this instruction, paragraph 2.1.
       3.3.3. Incident Commander: If an IFE or ground emergency has been declared, 8th Civil
       Engineer Squadron, Fire Department (8 CES/CEF) and the AMU weapons personnel will
       respond in an expedient manner. The 8 CES/CEF Senior Fire Official (SFO) is the
       Incident Commander. Only the on-scene commander will allow other personnel to
       approach the aircraft while safing procedures are being performed.
       3.3.4. If the aircraft/ordnance cannot be safed by AMU weapons personnel, or the
       munition is unsecured, a ground emergency will be declared. The aircraft will be
       immediately shutdown and the area will be evacuated IAW T.O. 1F-16C-33-1-2. EOD
       will respond and only personnel identified by EOD, with permission from the Incident
       Commander, will be allowed into the area until termination of the ground emergency.
       3.3.5. Transient Alert/Crash Recovery will respond with a tow team, standby tow vehicle
       and qualified personnel. After approval from the Incident Commander, they may chock
       and establish ground communication if not already done. If weapons safing procedures
       are not successful and the aircraft requires shut down, Transient Alert/Crash Recovery
       may perform aircraft “safe for maintenance” procedures (except for the weapons system)
       on declared hung ordnance IFEs.
       3.3.6. Unit Responsibilities: See Attachment 2 of this instruction.
    3.4. Hung Ordnance Procedures for Weapons Personnel and EOD:
       3.4.1. The de-arm/responding crew will safe the armament system and all other on-board
       munitions prior to starting the preliminary inspection of the hung ordnance. NOTE: If
       any 2.75 rocket motor(s) show signs of bulging, burns, soot, evidence of partial firing, or
       if rocket has moved in the LAU-131, 2W1X1 lead will notify Incident Commander and
       request dispatch of EOD.
       3.4.2. Hot brakes: If hot brakes are noted, alert the pilot of the condition. DO NOT
       ATTEMPT TO DE-ARM THE AIRCRAFT. Request pilot to notify ground control of
       the condition and declare a ground emergency.
       3.4.3. On a declared IFE, after approval from Incident Commander, responding AMU
       weapons personnel will make the initial assessment of the hung ordnance. After the
       armament system and all ordnance are declared safe, the aircraft may taxi back to its
       parking location, via normal taxi procedures.
       3.4.4. In the event of hung (unsecured) ordnance, after all other aircraft and ordnance
       safing has been accomplished, a weapons load crew, in conjunction with EOD, will
       attempt to secure (relock and sway) the ordnance on the aircraft IAW applicable technical
       data. In the event the ordnance cannot be secured to the suspension equipment, the safed
8FWI21-102 21 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                   7


      ordnance will be downloaded and transported to the Munitions Storage Area. After the
      armament system and all ordnance are declared safe, the aircraft may taxi back to its
      parking location, via normal taxi procedures.
4. Hung/Jammed Gun Systems and Ammunition Handling Procedures:
   4.1. General Information:
      4.1.1. Definition: F-16 gun handling system consists of the M61A1 gun, ammunition
      drum, and associated chutes. The Ammunition Loading System (ALS)/Universal
      Ammunition Loading System (UALS)/Linkless Ammunition Loading System (LALS)
      are used to store, transport, and load/unload 20mm ammunition.
   4.2. Safety Precaution: Perform all de-arm procedures and shut down the aircraft prior to
   accomplishing any maintenance that is required over normal safing procedures. The gun
   safety pin will not be removed unless directed by applicable Technical Orders (T.O).
   4.3. Gun Safing Procedures for Weapons Personnel:
      4.3.1. AMU weapons personnel will immediately respond with the necessary technical
      data and tools to recover and evaluate the aircraft condition.
      4.3.2. After approval from Incident Commander, prior to aircraft shutdown, weapons
      personnel will establish communications with the pilot and examine the rounds counter to
      determine if gun rotation occurred. If the gun system did not rotate, perform normal
      EOR/safing procedures. Inform the Incident Commander who will terminate the
      IFE/Ground emergency and allow the aircraft to taxi back to the appropriate parking area.
      If the gun system rotated, the aircraft must be shut down and a Ground Emergency
      declared, if not already done, in order to safely assess damage and determine if rounds
      are chambered. Personnel will not leave the aircraft unattended until the gun is safe.
          4.3.2.1. Gun clearing: Weapons personnel, with the assistance of 8 MXS/MXMR
          armament personnel (the armament crew will respond with at least one qualified
          seven-level), will make every effort to clear the gun of all chambered rounds IAW
          applicable T.O.s.
          4.3.2.2. If required during clearing procedures, gun barrels with live rounds/spent
          casings will be given to EOD personnel for disposal. Do not deliver gun barrels that
          contain live rounds or spent casings to the 8 MXS/MXMR maintenance facility.
      4.3.3. Aircraft with an unsafe or unknown gun condition will not leave the area until the
      gun is electrically and mechanically safe. Once the gun is electrically and mechanically
      safe, the aircraft may be restarted and taxied, or may be towed to the appropriate parking
      area.
   4.4. The following procedures are used if a hung or unsafe gun is discovered after the
   aircraft has cleared the de-arm area and is on the parking ramp:
      4.4.1. Personnel discovering a hung or unsafe gun will immediately notify the flight line
      expediter.
      4.4.2. Once the aircraft engine is confirmed as shut down, weapons personnel will
      attempt to mechanically and electrically safe the gun.
8                                                          8FWI21-102 21 NOVEMBER 2012


       4.4.3. If the gun cannot be immediately cleared due to a malfunction or damage, the
       flight line expediter will notify the production supervisor, weapons section supervision,
       and      MOC to declare a ground emergency. MOC will then ensure 8 MXS/MXMR
       personnel are dispatched and standing by.
       4.4.4. Evacuate all nonessential personnel. Upon arrival, the 8 CES/CEF SFO will serve
       as the Incident Commander. When rounds are chambered, the aircraft should be
       manually positioned (Do not use a tow vehicle) to point in the least hazardous direction if
       possible--if in a PAS Close the front door. AMU weapons personnel with the assistance
       of 8 MXS/MXMR personnel will proceed to safe the gun IAW applicable technical data.
       Once the gun is safe and the Incident Commander terminates the ground emergency, the
       AMU production supervisor or senior squadron maintenance member that is present will
       take charge.
    4.5. All live rounds and spent brass will be removed from M61A1 Gun/Handling
    Systems and ALS/UALS/LALS prior to performing any repair actions, to prevent
    accidental damage to rounds and/or injury to personnel:
       4.5.1. Live rounds will be separated from spent brass and placed in 20mm cans. Cans
       will be marked with stock number, nomenclature, quantity and aircraft tail number or
       ALS/UALS/LALS unit number.
       4.5.2. Explosive residue in the Gun/Handling System, ALS, UALS, or LALS will be
       placed in 20mm ammunition cans filled with water. The container will be clearly marked
       “Scrap Explosives.”
       4.5.3. When all 20mm ammunition and explosive residue are removed from the affected
       system, secure the ammunition cans and mark the contents on the outside of the cans.
       Notify Munitions Control that ammunition cans are ready for pickup.
    4.6. The following procedures will be used when a gun jam occurs during ammunition
    loading/unloading operations:
       4.6.1. If a gun jam occurs during loading/unloading operations, immediately contact 8
       MXS/MXMR for assistance. Do not make any adjustments to the gun system after the
       jam. Leave the system in the original condition it was in when the jam occurred. (Under
       no circumstances will the gun system be rotated backwards.)
       4.6.2. 8 MXS/MXMR personnel will respond with at least one qualified seven-level to
       the aircraft to determine the possible causes of the jam and the best course of corrective
       action.
       4.6.3. If the jam is determined to be in the gun system, weapons maintenance personnel
       will isolate the problem, download the ammunition if possible, and perform appropriate
       maintenance to return the gun system to service.
       4.6.4. Every effort will be made to remove all live rounds/spent casings from storage
       drums and chutes prior to removing the components and transporting them to the 8
       MXS/MXMR maintenance facility.
       4.6.5. If the ammunition cannot be removed from the storage drums and chutes without
       disassembly, remove the components from the aircraft and deliver to the 8 MXS/MXMR
       maintenance facility.
8FWI21-102 21 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                    9


      4.6.6. If there are damaged rounds and/or loose propellant present, MOC will be notified
      and a ground emergency declared.
      4.6.7. If the jam is in the ALS/UALS/LALS, annotate the AFTO Form 244,
      Industrial/Support Equipment Record, and transport the ALS/UALS/LALS to 8 MXS
      Munitions Storage Area for ammunition removal, if unable to remove the live
      rounds/spent casings. Then take the ALS/UALS/LALS to the Armament Flight
      maintenance facility for repair and removal of ammunition.
      4.6.8. Live rounds will be separated from spent brass and placed in 20mm cans. Cans
      will be marked with stock number, nomenclature, quantity and aircraft tail number , or
