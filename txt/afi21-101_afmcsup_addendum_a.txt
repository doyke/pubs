              2012


This instruction implements AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management,.
This publication does not apply to the Air National Guard Bureau (ANG) and the Air Force
Reserve Command (AFRC) and their units. However, if an AFRC unit is assigned or associated
with AFMC where AFMC is the lead this guidance would be applicable to the AFRC unit. This
publication is one of the Air Force directives for maintenance management and provides the
minimum basic logistics/maintenance-related program requirements for AFMC NSOs. NSOs
are organizations where their logistics/maintenance support missions are not organized under the
standard AFI 21-101 Combat Wing Organization (CWO) concept IAW AFI 38-101, Air Force
Organization and require supplemental guidance. It applies to all personnel who: Perform, plan,
schedule, evaluate, supervise or controls maintenance of research, manufacturing, test,
development, and integration laboratories and work centers. Deviation to provide/scope
applicability for logistics/maintenance NSOs in a stand-alone Addendum(s) to the MAJCOM
supplement is approved by AF/A4L IAW AFI 21-101.

1.1. Overview. The NSO applicability to AFI 21-101 and AFMC Supplement 1 is subjective;
therefore, this stand-alone instruction prescribes the basic programs to be used in NSOs (i.e., list
of requirements) and provides senior management, middle management, maintenance
supervisors, researchers, engineers, scientists, and technicians’ direction for accomplishment of
logistics/maintenance management. The affected NSOs have distinct mission areas requiring
development of separate guidance. The NSOs are expected to effectively use the resources
assigned to ensure mission accomplishment. NSOs are required to establish guidance and may
use additional management procedures not specifically prohibited by this instruction, any
technical order, or other applicable instruction. Supervisors at all levels are responsible to ensure
this directive is fully implemented. In the event of a conflict between this instruction and
Technical Orders (TO), TOs will take precedence.

                                    UNIT MSEP GRADING

A4.1. Unit MSEP Grading. Units must grade their MSEP evaluations using objective ratings
(Outstanding, Excellent, Satisfactory, Marginal, and Unsatisfactory). The unit MSEP shall
publish a final report of findings, problem areas, and recommended improvements (as required),
from the evaluation for distribution and/or briefing to unit Senior Leadership and inspected
organizations at least quarterly.
A4.2. Inspections and evaluations performed (e. g., PE, SI, QVI) will be rated-
PASS/FAIL. EXCEPTION: See AFI 21-200 and AFI 21-204 for additional information on
Nuclear Weapons PEs and certification program.
A4.2.1. Units will use the following five tier rating system:
A4.2.1.1. Outstanding 95-100%
A4.2.1.2. Excellent 90-94.99%
A4.2.1.3. Satisfactory 80-89.99%
A4.2.1.4. Marginal 70-79.99%
A4.2.1.5. Unsatisfactory 0-69.99%
A4.3. Ratings: Are calculated by dividing the total number of inspections passed by total
completed. For example, QA inspects 10 inspections with the following results: 9 “passes” and 1
“failure.” Divide the total “passes” by the total inspections (9/10=0.90) 90 percent for an
“Excellent” rating.
A4.3.1. Deduct 0.5 percentage points from overall percentage grade for each TDV, DSV, and
UCR. For example, a squadron earns an overall rating of 90 percent, Excellent‖. However, QA
observed 4 TDVs and 3 DSVs. Multiply the sum (7) by 0.5 and subtract the product (3.5) from
the original 90 percent. The adjusted total is 86.5 percent; therefore, the squadron is rated
Satisfactory.
A4.4. A cumulative Mx Group (or Squadron) score will: Be determined by dividing the
Group’s total number of inspections and evaluations passed by the total inspections and
evaluations completed. Deduct 0.5 percentage points for each TDV, DSV, and UCR from the
overall percentage grade, using same formula in previous step.
