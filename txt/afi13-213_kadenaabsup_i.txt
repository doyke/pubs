                                           Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Scope and Purpose.
   1.1.1. This AFI provides guidance for developing an Airfield Driving Program (ADP) to
   provide safe ground vehicle operations and pedestrian control on USAF owned and/or
   operated airfields. It outlines training requirements for all personnel (e.g. military, DoD
   Civilians, Contractors, etc.) who, as a part of their job, are required to drive unescorted on an
   airfield.
      1.1.1.1. (Added-KADENAAB) The Base Airfield Driving Program Manager (ADPM)
      is the Office of Primary Responsibility for the Kadena AB Airfield Driving Program.
      Airfield Management trains and certifies the unit ADPMs. Unit ADPMs manage the unit
      program, and train and certify additional airfield trainers, if required. These trainers then
      train and certify unit personnel who have a requirement to drive on the airfield.
      1.1.1.2. (Added-KADENAAB) Prior to operating a vehicle on the airfield, all personnel
      must be trained on local driving procedures and possess a valid AF Form 2293, US Air
      Force Motor Vehicle Operator Identification Card (GOV License), and AF Form 483,
      Certificate of Competency endorsed for airfield driving. This requirement applies to
      military and civilian employees who are either assigned to, visiting or on temporary duty
      to Kadena AB.
   1.1.2. Personnel required to drive on the airfield must be knowledgeable of and comply with
   the procedures outlined in this AFI and locally developed Airfield Driving Instruction (ADI).
   For the purpose of this AFI, the ADI is a wing or base level instruction.
   1.1.3. In today’s complex airfield environment, there are incidents involving aircraft,
   pedestrians, and ground vehicles at USAF airfields that lead to property damage and
   personnel injury. One of the most hazardous incidents for an airfield driver to be involved
   with is a runway incursion. A runway incursion occurs when an aircraft, vehicle or person
   enters the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-off of aircraft
   without approval from Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT). Runway incursions have the
   potential to result in aircraft endangerment and loss of life. While there are several factors
   involved in a runway incursion, the leading causes of these incidents result from a failure to
   follow procedures, inadequate vehicle operator training, and loss of situational awareness.
   Therefore, strict adherence to the procedures in this AFI is essential to preventing aircraft-
   vehicle mishaps and personnel injury on the airfield.
   1.1.4. Shared-Use Airfields. Airfield Management (AM) personnel at shared-use airfields
   (e.g. Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve units) must work with the civil airport manager
   to develop and implement local airfield driving procedures where applicable.
   1.1.5. Contingency Locations. At contingency locations, the Senior Airfield Authority
   (SAA) or equivalent, may authorize deviations to airfield driving procedures outlined in this
   AFI to support tactical or combat operations/situations. Authority must not be delegated.
      1.1.5.1. In the interest of safety to airfield and flight operations, deviations to this AFI
      should be by exception only and include a Risk Management assessment. Factors to
6                                               AFI13-213_KADENAABSUP_I 9 JULY 2012


       consider for deviations include but are not limited to the length of time the operation has
       been in place and available resources.
       1.1.5.2. If time permits, or at the discretion of the SAA or equivalent, forward proposed
       deviations to the MAJCOM OPR for AO, or equivalent, for an operational review.
       1.1.5.3. Provide the MAJCOM OPR for AO, or equivalent, an informational copy of
       approved deviations to assist with establishing compliance priorities, providing oversight,
       and developing area of responsibility execution activities.
1.2. Waivers, Recommended Changes and Issuing New Airfield Driving Policy or
Procedures.
    1.2.1. Waivers.
       1.2.1.1. Waiver Authority. HQ AFFSA/A3A will provide waivers to this instruction
       only upon an official MAJCOM OPR for AO request when a requirement makes a waiver
       necessary or compliance with creates a hazard. HQ AFFSA/A3A grants waivers to this
       AFI for a period not to exceed two years.
       1.2.1.2. Waiver Process. AF IMT 4058, Airfield Operations Policy Waiver will be used
       to request waivers to this instruction. If additional space is required, annotate on plain
       bond paper and submit along with the form. Number each comment with the
       corresponding block number. In addition, units will submit an Operational Risk
       Management (ORM) Assessment in accordance with AFPAM 90-902, Operational Risk
       Management (ORM) Guidelines and Tools or alternate risk mitigation procedures with all
       waiver requests.
           1.2.1.2.1. All waiver requests to this instruction must be reviewed/coordinated on by
           the Wing Airfield Driving Program Manager (Wing ADPM), Airfield Operations
           Flight Commander (AOF/CC) and Wing Safety.
           1.2.1.2.2. The AOF/CC forwards the AF IMT 4058 through the Senior Operational
           Commander (e.g., OG/CC) to the MAJCOM OPR for AO, who will then
           review/coordinate and send to HQ AFFSA.

         operation necessity to drive on the airfield at night the unit commanders may submit a
         waiver to the Airfield Manager. Waivers will be coordinated with the unit ADPM,
         18th Medical Group, and 18th Wing Safety. A practical driving evaluation will be
         conducted by the Airfield Manager. Results will be annotated on the waiver request
         letter. If an AFSC specifies the individual cannot be color blind, the waiver will be
         disapproved.
             3.2.5.2.3.1. (Added-KADENAAB) If approved by the Airfield Manager, the
             individual’s AF Form 483 will be stamped ―AUTHORIZED KADENA AB

            3.2.7.2.1.1.4. (Added-KADENAAB) CMA Communication Procedures:
             3.2.7.2.1.1.4.1. (Added-KADENAAB) All vehicles must have two-way
             radio contact with the tower and will conduct a radio check with the tower
             prior to entering the CMA. They must also remain in radio contact with the
             tower while in the CMA or be escorted by a vehicle that meets these
             requirements.
             3.2.7.2.1.1.4.2. (Added-KADENAAB) CMA access is strictly limited to
             vehicles transporting hazardous materials, airfield management, barrier
             maintenance when working on the runway, airfield lighting when working
             on the runway, K-loaders, aircraft tows, and vehicles responding to an
             emergency. Exceptions may be coordinated with the Airfield Operations
             Flight Commander. Airfield Management will ensure the number of
             certified drivers is kept to an absolute minimum.
             3.2.7.2.1.1.4.3. (Added-KADENAAB) Vehicles approaching the CMA
             shall stop prior to the Visual Flight Rules (VFR)/Instrument Hold Line and
             obtain approval from tower prior to crossing. Never cross the VFR or
             Instrument Hold Lines without permission from the control tower.
             3.2.7.2.1.1.4.4. (Added-KADENAAB) On taxiways Alpha, Bravo, Echo
             North and Foxtrot, the Instrument Hold Line is the primary hold line.
             3.2.7.2.1.1.4.5. (Added-KADENAAB) Vehicles will cross runways
             expeditiously after receiving approval from control tower. Operators
             requesting access onto the runway to a specific location shall remain in the
             immediate vicinity of that location unless otherwise authorized by the
             control tower. Operators anticipating travel along the length of the runway
             shall advise tower upon initial request.
     3.2.7.2.2. Vehicle drivers and/or pedestrians must read back all ATC instructions
     verbatim.
        3.2.7.2.2.1. (Added-KADENAAB) Due to the complexity of air traffic control,
        other instructions may be given. It is important that vehicle operators listen
        carefully and repeat instructions verbatim. When reporting off of a movement
        area, vehicle operators will ensure a response is received from tower. Note: The
        control tower is often busy on other frequencies and may take some time to
        respond. Vehicle operators should wait at least one full minute before calling
        again.
        3.2.7.2.2.2. (Added-KADENAAB) Strict radio discipline is mandatory. No
        Citizen Band (CB), sarcastic, superfluous, obscene, or deceptive transmissions
        will be made. Call signs will be used at all times.
        3.2.7.2.2.3. (Added-KADENAAB) To eliminate miscommunications and the
        degradation of safety, it is imperative operators adhere to standard air traffic
        control phraseology. Refer to Chapter 4 for authorized transmission phraseology.
        Under no circumstances will a vehicle proceed onto a runway if there is any
        uncertainty concerning approval.
AFI13-213_KADENAABSUP_I 9 JULY 2012                                                          29


           3.2.7.2.2.4. (Added-KADENAAB) All vehicle operators will ensure the tower
           uses their exact call sign. Hearing the correct location of your vehicle, but the
           wrong call sign does not indicate approval of your request. For example, if your
           vehicle’s call sign is Bearcat 10 and you are requesting access onto runway 05R
           and tower gives approval for Bearcat 01 to proceed onto runway 05R, you DO
           NOT have approval onto runway 05R. Even if it appears obvious that you are the
           only vehicle in that location; do not proceed until the control tower uses the
           correct call sign. Do not hesitate to question the tower if there is any ambiguity.
           3.2.7.2.2.5. (Added-KADENAAB) If other vehicles will accompany the vehicle
           requesting access to an area, the vehicle operator must state the word ―plus‖ and
           the number of vehicles that will accompany. For example: ―Ops 1 plus 2.‖
        3.2.7.2.3. Vehicle operators and/or pedestrians must always monitor the appropriate
        radio frequency when in the CMA.
        3.2.7.2.4. Vehicle operators must use LED/rotating beacon lights and/or emergency
        flashers when driving in the CMA.
        3.2.7.2.5. Vehicles operating in the CMA on a daily basis should have a permanent
        radio mounted in the vehicle to communicate with the ATCT. A hand-held radio
        should only be used as a backup or when communication is required outside the
        vehicle. Note: Conduct an operational test of the radio before entering the airfield.
        3.2.7.2.6. Vehicle drivers and/or pedestrians operating on the CMA must use a
        distinct call sign (e.g., Airfield 1, Chief 1, Sweeper 1, TA 1, etc.) coordinated by the
        Wing ADPM to avoid duplicating, confusing, or different agencies using similar
        names (e.g. Airfield 1, Airfield Lighting, Airfield Sweeper, etc.). Note: Do not use a
        call sign that is also a part of ATC phraseology such as ―Taxi‖.
           3.2.7.2.6.1. Include vehicle and/or pedestrian call signs in the ADI.
           3.2.7.2.6.2. For standardization, AM personnel will use the radio call signs listed
           below. Note: AM personnel at Joint/Shared-Use and host nation airfields may
           use different vehicle call signs to prevent duplication/similar call signs with local
           civilian airport operations personnel.
               3.2.7.2.6.2.1. Airfield Manager (Airfield – 1).
               3.2.7.2.6.2.2. Deputy/Assistant Airfield Manager (Airfield – 2).
               3.2.7.2.6.2.3. NCOIC, Airfield Management, NCOIC, Airfield Management
               Operations, NCOIC, Airfield Management Training and Airfield Management
               Operations Personnel or civilian equivalents (Airfield 3, 4, 5, etc.)
               3.2.7.2.6.2.4. (Added-KADENAAB) Please see Attachment 10, LMR Call
               Signs.
        3.2.7.2.7. Do not issue or use unconditional instructions (blanket approval) when
        authorizing vehicles to enter the runway for the purpose of an airfield
        inspection/check or other airfield operation. See FAA JO 7110.65, Air Traffic
        Control for additional information.

        3.2.7.2.8. Limit crossing the runway to vehicle operators/traffic performing mission
        essential duties and then only to an absolute minimum. Note: When crossing a
        runway is required during flying operations, the preferred crossing point is the
        departure end.
            3.2.7.2.8.1. (Added-KADENAAB) Runway convenience crossings are not
            authorized and will be considered an airfield driving violation. Violators will lose
            driving privileges for a minimum of 30 days.

     3.2.7.10. Procedures and standards to comply with control tower light gun signals. Air
     traffic controllers use a light gun as a backup system for communicating with aircraft or
     ground vehicles if their radios stop working. When a vehicle operator experiences a
     radio failure on a runway or taxiway, they must vacate the runway as quickly and safely
     as possible and contact the ATCT or AM by other means, such as a cellular telephone to
     advise of the situation. If this is not practical, then the driver, after vacating the runway,
     should turn the vehicle toward the tower and start flashing the vehicle headlights and wait
     for the controller to signal with the light gun. All vehicle operators are required to know
     and comply with the following signals:
        3.2.7.10.1. Steady Green Light: ―Cleared to cross‖, ―Proceed‖, ―Go‖.
        3.2.7.10.2. Steady Red Light: ―STOP! Vehicle will not be moved‖.

        AM or their work control center until the emergency is terminated. The withdrawal
        of contractors will be at the discretion of AM.
        3.2.7.10.6. (Added-KADENAAB) All vehicles will have a light gun placard or
        decal Air Force Visual Aid (AFVA) 11-240, Airport Signs and Markings, displayed
        in plain view of the driver.
        3.2.7.10.7. (Added-KADENAAB) In the event vehicles or personnel on the runway
        do not respond to light gun signals, the tower will raise and lower the intensity of the
        runway lighting. This signal directs all runway occupants to immediately exit the
        runway and establish communications with the tower.
36                                             AFI13-213_KADENAABSUP_I 9 JULY 2012


        3.2.7.10.8. (Added-KADENAAB) Extreme caution should be used not to confuse

                the airfield without first stopping and thoroughly checking tires for stones and
                other foreign objects. ―Roll-over‖ FOD checks will be performed prior to
                entering the airfield. Roll-over FOD checks consist of an initial FOD check,
                and then moving the vehicle forward enough to examine the remaining tire
                tread.
                3.2.7.11.1.1.2. (Added-KADENAAB) FOD checks will also be conducted

                equipment carried on their vehicle is properly stored and secured before
                operating their vehicle on the airfield. Operators will ensure the cargo bed and
                the passenger compartment floor are clean to prevent debris from falling onto
                the airfield. Vehicles that utilize the airfield at night will carry a flashlight to
                accomplish the FOD check.
                3.2.7.11.1.2.2. (Added-KADENAAB) General             and   special     purpose
                government motor vehicles which routinely require access to the airfield will
                carry a covered container, clearly marked with contrasting letters no less than
                two inches in height, for deposit of FOD. These containers will be securely
                fastened to the vehicle and will be emptied frequently.

  RADIO COMMUNICATIONS PHRASEOLOGY, DISCIPLINE AND TECHNIQUES

4.1. General.
   4.1.1. Radio communications are a critical link in the ATC system. The single, most
   important thought in communications with the ATCT is understanding. It is essential to
   acknowledge each radio communication with controllers by using the appropriate call sign.
   4.1.2. Brevity is important, therefore, radio transmissions must be kept as brief as possible.
   However, controllers must know what you want to do before they can properly carry out their
   control duties. Conversely, the vehicle operator, must know exactly what the controller
   wants them to do.
   4.1.3. Vehicle operators must maintain vigilance in monitoring air traffic control radio
   communications frequencies for situational awareness, especially when operating on an
   active runway.
4.2. Radio Techniques.
   4.2.1. Listen before transmitting. If someone else is talking, the keying of another
   transmitter will be ineffective and will probably override/block out the other receiver causing
   the other vehicle operator to repeat his or her call.
   4.2.2. Think before keying the transmitter. You must know exactly what you need to say
   before you say it.
   4.2.3. The microphone should be very close to your lips and, after pressing the ―microphone
   button‖, a slight pause may be necessary to be sure, the first word is transmitted clearly.
   Speak in a normal, conversational tone.
   4.2.4. When releasing the microphone button, wait a few seconds before calling again. The
   controller may be looking for you on the airfield, transmitting on a different frequency, or
   scanning the runway to enable your request.
   4.2.5. Be alert to the sounds or the lack of sounds in the receiver. Check your volume,
   recheck your frequency, and make sure that your microphone is not stuck in the transmit
   position. Frequency blockage can, and has, occurred for extended periods due to
   unintentional transmitter operation. This type of interference is commonly referred to as a
   ―stuck mike,‖ and controllers may refer to it in this manner when attempting to correct the
   problem.
   4.2.6. Be sure that you are within the performance range of your radio equipment and the
   ground station equipment. Refer to the airfield diagram to determine possible radio blind
   spots.
   4.2.7. Use caution when using a vehicle mounted/handheld radio and operating a vehicle at
   the same time. When possible, only use the radio when the vehicle is safely parked.
4.3. Phraseology. Vehicle operators must contact the ATCT controller each and every time
they proceed onto or leave the CMA. When proceeding onto a CMA, vehicle operators must
advise the controller of three things: WHO you are, WHERE you are, and WHAT your
AFI13-213_KADENAABSUP_I 9 JULY 2012                                                            53


intentions are. Vehicle operators must always acknowledge all communications so ground
control and other persons know that the message was received. Vehicle operators must always
give aircraft and ground control transmissions priority unless an emergency exists. VHF/UHF
transmissions are reserved for the primary use of aircraft and ATCT personnel.
   4.3.1. A typical runway crossing transmission sequence is as follows:

Table 4.1. Sample Runway Crossing Phraseology.
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                     “JACKSONVILLE TOWER
                                      AIRFIELD ONE.”
ATCT:                                 “AIRFIELD ONE, JACKSONVILLE
                                      TOWER.”
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                     “JACKSONVILLE TOWER,
                                      AIRFIELD ONE REQUEST TO
                                      CROSS (runway) AT
                                      (point/intersection).
ATCT:                                 “AIRFIELD ONE, CROSS (runway)
                                      AT (point/intersection).
                                      or
                                      “AIRFIELD ONE, HOLD SHORT
                                      OF (runway).”
   4.3.2. Always read back instructions verbatim before taking any action and allow time for
   correction, if misinterpreted. If you are unsure what the controller has transmitted, or if you
   do not understand an instruction, you MUST ask the controller to repeat it. Good
   communications only occur when each party knows and understands what the other is saying.

Table 4.2. Sample Read back Instructions
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                      “AIRFIELD ONE UNDERSTANDS
                                       APPROVED TO CROSS (runway)

proceeds across the runway             or
                                       “AIRFIELD ONE, HOLDING
                                       SHORT (at location).”
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                      “JACKSONVILLE TOWER,
                                       AIRFIELD ONE CROSSING

ATCT:                                  ―AIRFIELD ONE, ROGER.”

   4.3.3. If vehicle operators are issued hold short instructions, they are required to provide a
   read back to the ATCT.

                                   how well the transmission is being
AFI13-213_KADENAABSUP_I 9 JULY 2012                                                          55


                                     received.

  Immediately or without delay,      Phrase used by ATC when such
           Expedite                  action compliance is required to
                                     avoid an imminent situation.

            Negative                 "No" or "permission not granted" or
                                     "that is not correct."

               Out                   The radio conversation is ended, and
                                     no response is expected.

              Over                   My radio transmission is ended, and
                                     I expect a response.

            Read Back                Repeat my message to me.

              Roger                  I have received all of your last
                                     transmission.

            Stand By                 Means the controller or pilot must
                                     pause for a few seconds, usually to
                                     attend to other duties of a higher
                                     priority. Also means to wait as in
                                     "stand by for clearance." The caller
                                     should reestablish contact if a delay
                                     is lengthy.

             Unable                  Indicates inability to comply with a
                                     specific instruction, request, or
                                     clearance.

              Verify                 Request confirmation of

                                     understand it, and will comply with
                                     it.

   4.4.1. (Added-KADENAAB) The inclusion of words such as ―expedite,‖ ―without delay,‖
   or ―immediately‖ indicate that the tower expects the vehicle operator to proceed with his/her
   request rapidly, without hesitation. Operators unable to comply will remain out of the CMA,
   advise tower ―unable,‖ and await further instructions.
4.5. Phonetic Aviation Alphabet. Because some letters have similar sounds, like B and P, the
international aviation industry uses the following words to reduce confusion. For example,
Taxiway B would be referred to as Taxiway Bravo on the radio. Vehicle operators must know
and use the following Phonetic Aviation Alphabet:

Controlled Movement Area (CMA)—As defined in Airfield Operation Instructions, any
portion of the airfield requiring aircraft, vehicles and pedestrians to obtain specific Air Traffic
Control Tower (ATCT) approval for (normally via two-way radio contact with the ATCT).
Controlled Movement Areas include but are not limited to areas used for takeoff, landing and as
required taxiing of aircraft. Note: This definition is used in lieu of "movement area" as defined
in the FAA Pilot Controller Glossary. Also called CMA.
Controlled Movement Area Violation (CMAV) Event—An airfield infraction caused by
aircraft, vehicles, or pedestrians entering the control movement area without specific ATCT
approval. This definition includes runway incursions and infractions caused by communication
errors. Refer to AFI 91-223 paragraphs 1.3.1.8. for reportable HATR reporting procedures and
1.3.1.9. for reportable CMAV events.
Expedite—Used by ATC when prompt compliance is required to avoid the development of an
imminent situation.
Foreign Object Damage (FOD)—Any damage to an aircraft, engine, aircraft system,
component, tire, munitions, or support equipment caused by a foreign object(s) which may or
may not degrade the required safety and/or operational characteristics of the aforementioned
items.
Government Owned Vehicles (GOVs)—Vehicles that are owned or leased by the US
government.
Ground Vehicle Traffic Lane—A defined and marked lane on the flightline used for the
movement of vehicle traffic.
Hold or Hold Short—Used by ATC to indicate you must stay where you are currently located
or for you to hold at the Runway Hold line/VFR hold line prior to receiving approval into the
CMA.
Host Wing Commander—The individual with ultimate responsibility for operating the airfield.
AFI13-213_KADENAABSUP_I 9 JULY 2012                                                              61


Hot Spot—A runway safety related problem area or intersection on an airfield. Typically, it is a
complex or confusing taxiway/taxiway or taxiway/runway intersection. A confusing condition
may be compounded by a miscommunication between a controller and a pilot, and may cause an
aircraft separation standard to be compromised. The area may have a history of surface incidents
or the potential for surface incidents.
Immediately—Used by ATC when such action compliance is required to avoid an imminent
situation.
Instrument Hold line—A designated boundary intended to protect the runway environment.
Found at the point where a taxiway and runway intersect. Instrument hold line is marked in
retro-reflective yellow paint.
Light Gun—A handheld directional light signaling device which emits a brilliant narrow beam
of white, green, or red light as selected by the tower controller. The color and type of light
transmitted can be used to approve or disapprove anticipated pilot actions where radio
communication is not available. The light gun is used for controlling traffic operating in the
vicinity of the airport and on the airport movement area.
Major Command (MAJCOM)—For the purpose of this instruction, includes all USAF Major
Commands plus the Air National Guard Readiness Center, Air Force Reserve Command, Direct
Reporting Units, and Field Operating Agencies. MAJCOM also refers to the OPR for Airfield
Operations in this AFI.
Negative—No, or permission not granted, or that is not correct.
Out—The conversation is ended and no response is expected.
Over—My transmission is ended; I expect a response.
Parking Ramp/Apron—Areas where aircraft are parked, loaded and unloaded and serviced
between flights. Vehicles and aircraft operate in close proximity in these areas, so it is vital to
maintain a safe distance between your vehicle and aircraft. Always yield to aircraft and never
drive under an aircraft or its wings. Slow speed and extreme caution are required in these areas.
Perimeter Road—A road around the runway perimeter designed to connect the access roads.
Precision Obstacle Free Zone—An 800 foot wide by 200 foot long area centered on the runway
centerline adjacent to the threshold designed to protect aircraft flying precision approaches from
ground vehicles and other aircraft when ceiling is less than 250 feet or visibility is less than 3/4
statute mile (or runway visual range below 4,000 feet.)
Privately Owned Vehicle (POVs)—A vehicle that is owned or leased by a private party.
Proceed—Authorization to begin/continue on approved routes.
Ramp—Either concrete or asphalt (depending on the weight of the aircraft and the sub-base of
the ground beneath) used to park aircraft or equipment.
Read Back—Repeat my message back to me.
Restricted Area—An area on the airfield designated for the use by aircraft/equipment requiring
security protection level. Marked with signs prior to entering, Red Lines will indicate the
boundaries.
 62                                              AFI13-213_KADENAABSUP_I 9 JULY 2012


Roger—I understand and have received all of your transmission.
Runway—A defined rectangular area on an airfield prepared for the landing and takeoff of
aircraft.
Runway Hold line—A designated boundary intended to protect the runway environment.
Found at the point where a taxiway and runway intersect.
Runway Incursion—Any occurrence at an aerodrome involving the incorrect presence of an
aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-
off of aircraft. For the purpose of this instruction, the protected area is the same as the CMA.
These are further classified into three operational categories:
   1) Operational Error (OE)—A failure of the air traffic control system that results in loss of
separation.
   2) Pilot Deviation (PD)—The action of a pilot that results in the violation of ATC
instructions, AFIs and/or FARs.
   3) Vehicle/Pedestrian Deviation(V/PD)—Any entry or movement on the controlled
movement area by a vehicle (including aircraft operated by non-pilots) or pedestrian that has not
been authorized by Air Traffic Control.
Say Again—Used to request a repeat of the last transmission. Usually specifies transmission
was not understood or received.
Stand By—To pause while other duties of a higher priority are attended to. Also means to
standby for clearance/approval.
Taxilane—Ramp space between rows of parked aircraft used to maneuver aircraft to and from
parking spots and taxiways.
Taxiway—A paved surface for taxiing aircraft from parking ramp to runway.
Unit—For the purpose of this AFI, the term unit is equivalent to a Squadron, also known as the
basic unit in the USAF organizational structure. Squadrons are usually made up of several
flights (typically four), and commanded by a field grade officer.
Wake Turbulence—A phenomenon resulting from the passage of an aircraft through the
atmosphere. The term includes vortices, thrust stream turbulence, jet blast, jet wash, propeller
wash, and rotor wash both on the ground and in the air.
Wing Commander—The individual with ultimate responsibility for operating the airfield.
Without Delay—With a sense of urgency, proceed with approved instructions in a rapid
manner.
Words Twice—Communication is difficult. Please say every phrase twice.
Wilco—I have received your message, understand it, and will comply with it.
