USAFECL33-14 12 APRIL 2006                                                                                3


1. General. The items listed do not constitute the order or limit the scope of the inspection or assessment.
As a minimum, units should use inspection checklists in conjunction with the Unit Self-Assessment. The
objective is to identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required capabilities. Higher headquarters
may use this checklist in whole or in part during visits or exercises.
   1.1. Common Core Readiness Criteria (CCRC). CCRC represent five basic, overarching readi-
   ness criteria that the Inspector General (HQ USAFE/IG) will apply to each area of its ORIs. Each
   CCRC has one or more associated questions to facilitate its use by inspectors. Upper case and bold let-
   ters are used to identify CCRCs. The five areas include:
       1.1.1. Threat. Is the unit able to implement and sustain appropriate measures to meet changing
       Force Protections (FPCON)?
       1.1.2. Safety. Does the unit safety program facilitate unit readiness?
       1.1.3. Security. Were adequate measures employed throughout the exercise? Were Operation
       Security (OPSEC) procedures incorporated into plans and followed throughout the exercise? Were
       proper Communications Security (COMSEC) materials available, as specified in tasked opera-
       tions plans, to ensure mission accomplishment? Were COMSEC, Computer Security (COM-
       PUSEC) and other measures employed to deny the enemy information?
       1.1.4. Communications and Information. Were these operations effective?
       1.1.5. Training. Were units properly trained and equipped to perform wartime duties?
   1.2. Readiness Criteria (RC). Areas deemed necessary by functional managers that require special
   vigilance and are important to the overall performance of the unit. Standard sentence case is used to
   identify RCs.

2. Applicability. All items on this checklist are assigned an applicability code designating the wing/unit/
installation to which the item applies. Reference for the applicability code is AFI 90-201, USAFESUP1,
Table A11.2., Inspection Applicability Table. NOTE: All instances of Inspection Applicability Code 10,
defined as ‘other,’ are applicable to the 1st Combat Communications Squadron on this functional guide
only.

3. Authorized Simulations. The following pre-approved simulations apply to Combat Communications
Squadron (CBCS), Air Control Squadrons and deployed Air Operations Centers. They are in addition to
the standing simulations listed in AFI 90-201_USAFE SUP 1, Attachment 12, paragraph A12.5. These
simulations must be coordinated with USAFE IG to ensure appropriate timing and credit is afforded to
subject activities.
   3.1. Grids. Pre-existing grounding grids may be used, however, units must measure grid resistance
   with equipment specifically designed to test ground resistance (e.g., Vibroground) prior to use. The
   unit must demonstrate ground grid installation and all grids must meet technical order (T.O.)
   31-10-24, Installation Practices-Communications Systems Grounding, Bonding, and Shielding, and
   other applicable publications.
   3.2. Landlines. Cellular telephone use is authorized for real-world emergencies and for ground
   mobile forces (GMF) satellite control contacts when a commercial or defense switched network
   (DSN) landline cannot be established. GMF or systems control personnel must attempt to use order
4                                                                      USAFECL33-14 12 APRIL 2006


    wire (according to applicable technical order guidance) or Iridium, and then may revert to cell phone
    for economical reasons.

4. Rating Standards.
    4.1. Overall Rating Standards.
       4.1.1. Overall communications support is determined by the unit’s ability to establish reliable
       Communications and Information support, as well as safe and reliable Airfield Services. Service
       activation timing commences at a pre-established S-hour. Units may pre-position equipment, pal-
       lets, and personnel prior to S-hour, however no attempt to unpack or assemble equipment may be
       made until S-hour. The service activation timing requirement will be dependent upon tasked Unit
       Type Codes (UTC), scenario, and inspection concept. Inspection milestones and timelines will be
       determined during the ORI pre-planning phases.
       4.1.2. Grading for the overall area of Communications and Information is primarily determined
       by the below criteria, with special emphasis given to Command and Control Communications
       (C3) Services and Deployable Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (DATCALS). Inspectors
       will use a five-tier rating system for evaluating all areas. Inspectors will assign overall ratings to
       the UTCs being inspected based on performance, and will use objective rating criteria whenever
       possible. These criteria are designed as a guide, and do not obligate certain ratings or serve as a
       substitute for professional judgment.
           4.1.2.1. OUTSTANDING. All tasked C3 SERVICES and DATCALS UTCs rated at least
           OUTSTANDING, with all remaining tasked UTCs rated at least EXCELLENT.
           4.1.2.2. EXCELLENT. All tasked C3 SERVICES and DATCALS UTCs rated at least
           EXCELLENT, with all remaining tasked UTCs rated at least SATISFACTORY.
           4.1.2.3. SATISFACTORY. All tasked C3 SERVICES and DATCALS UTC rated at least
           SATISFACTORY, with no UNSATISFACTORY rated UTCs.
           4.1.2.4. MARGINAL. Either tasked C3 SERVICES or DATCALS UTCs rated overall
           MARGINAL regardless of additionally tasked UTC ratings.
           4.1.2.5. UNSATISFACTORY. Either tasked C3 SERVICES or DATCALS U T C s r a t e d
           overall UNSATISFACTORY regardless of additionally tasked UTC ratings.
       4.1.3. C4 services will be delivered to two separate user locations in addition to the communica-
       tion unit's own requirements. For units supporting DATCALS, the airfield service site may be con-
       sidered one of the user locations.
       4.1.4. The C3 SERVICES major graded area must include, at a minimum, activation of all
       required services according to ANNEX K requirements at all locations.
           4.1.4.1. A unit's own communications requirements will be separate and distinct from the user
           locations with the exception of a DATCALS site, where applicable.
       4.1.5. Commanders will notify IG DRAGON Operations (OPS) when a service is ready for vali-
       dation. Each user location may be validated separately. There is no requirement to wait for all user
       locations to be activated before any are validated.
USAFECL33-14 12 APRIL 2006                                                                               5


     4.1.6. The IG team will validate any remaining services when activation timing has expired. The
     service identified in the unit's Annex K, technical data package (TDP), or similar document is val-
     idated at the customer's location. Service drops will undergo a single validation attempt.
     4.1.7. A validation failure due to circumstances beyond the unit's control may not result in a ser-
     vice activation penalty.
     4.1.8. Time allowed for service activation will be adjusted due to circumstances beyond the unit's
     control (i.e., all air cargo has not arrived on site, Standard Tactical Entry Point (STEP)/reach back
     facilities not responsive or caused delays, transmission system verified or validated propagation
     problems). Additionally, a local or distant-end weather condition which affects the entire site (i.e.,
     lightning, wind/snow storm) or equipment-specific weather conditions may result in a timing
     adjustment. An example of an equipment-specific weather condition would be high winds affect-
     ing set-up of an AN/USC-60A or quick reaction satellite antenna. The unit will continue other
     activation measures until weather conditions permit mission completion.
     4.1.9. Non C3 SERVICES or DATCALS (for example 6KTD0, 6KPVS, etc.) checklist items are
     rated to the go/no-go standard. Any single CCRC item rated ‘no-go’ automatically constitutes a
     rating of not greater than SATISFACTORY for that entire UTC. Inspectors will assign overall rat-
     ings to these UTCs based on an average of successfully completed items and will use objective
     rating criteria whenever possible. These criteria are designed as a guide, and again, do not obligate
     certain ratings or serve as a substitute for professional judgment.
  4.2. Rating C3 SERVICES UTCs.
     4.2.1. Data and Voice service sub-area ratings are determined by the percentage of successfully
     validated service drops. The result is applied to Table 1. and Table 2. Command, Control (C2)
     communications and the Initial Communications Element sub-areas will be graded according to
     Table 3. and Table 4. The overall area of C3 SERVICES UTCs will be rated as follows:
        4.2.1.1. OUTSTANDING. A Majority of C3 SERVICES sub-areas rated OUTSTANDING
        and any remaining C3 SERVICES areas rated at least EXCELLENT.
        4.2.1.2. EXCELLENT. A Majority of C3 SERVICES sub-areas rated EXCELLENT or
        higher and any remaining C3 SERVICES sub-areas rated at least SATISFACTORY.
        4.2.1.3. SATISFACTORY. A Majority of C3 SERVICES sub-areas rated SATISFACTORY
        or higher with no more than one C3 SERVICES sub-area rated MARGINAL.
        4.2.1.4. MARGINAL. Two or more C3 SERVICES sub-areas rated MARGINAL and/or
        any one C3 SERVICES sub-area rated UNSATISFACTORY.
        4.2.1.5. UNSATISFACTORY. Two or more C3 SERVICES sub-areas rated UNSATISFAC-
        TORY.
  4.3. C3 SERVICES Data Services.
     4.3.1. Provide all designed and tasked data services, including communications focal point
     requirements, identified in the unit’s technical data package (TDP), Annex K, or similar system
     architecture design document. Service activation is complete when all tasked specific services
     function as designed and intended. The IG may provide additional data service requirements.

NOTES:
1. If the commander calls for formal validation check at either the 24 or 30-hour point and the
   end equipment fails validation check, then the end equipment will be revalidated only at
   the 36-hour point. This is a single “turn-back” option, where a commander is provided an
   incentive to request early validation check in order to achieve a higher rating with lower
   activation requirements, however, activation failures will only be revalidated once at the
   36-hour point. (EXAMPLE: A commander requests validation check at the 20:00 hour
   point and 85 percent of the service locations are validated. The resulting rating would be
   an “Excellent.” If the commander would like to achieve an “Outstanding”, the commander
   may request a revalidation of the 15 percent of Annex K service locations which failed.
   This revalidation will only take place at the 36-hour point. In addition, >90 percent of the
   “Additional Taskings”, see NOTE 2, must pass the validation check in order to achieve an
   “Outstanding” rating).
2. Additional networking requirements or constraints (over and above the Annex K service
   requirements outlined by the Inspector General) may be tasked either verbally or in writ-
   ing, not later than the S-24 hour point. These requirements may include, but are not limited
   to, additional Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET), Secure Internet
   Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET), or network expansion capability (ability to plan for
   additional user capability, but not necessarily service demonstration), VTC, or additional
   service requirement (such as on-site intranet or .mil internet capability). This exercises the
   unit’s flexibility to prioritize requirements and engineer them based on changing user
   requirements.
3. If service rate falls in this category at validation check, further service validation will be
   halted and resumed only at the 36-hour point. Ratings of Satisfactory, Marginal, or Unsat-
   isfactory will not be assessed prior to the 36-hour point.

USAFECL33-14 12 APRIL 2006                                                                              7


       4.4.1. Service activation is determined by two-way conversation. All designed or tasked capabil-
       ities must be operational (e.g., secure and non-secure, DSN, commercial, long locals,
       point-to-points, and hotlines). The IG may provide additional voice service requirements.

NOTE:
1. C2 Communications (ultra High frequency (UHF) SATCOM or Iridium) voice service acti-
   vation is determined by two-way conversation. Systems that support data will be validated
   by a file transfer between computers or by accessing a network service or computer.
   Encryption will be used where designed in Annex K. Designed or tasked data capabilities
   must be operational. Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Satellite Communication (SATCOM)
   secure voice and data service will be validated. Available Iridium voice capabilities will be
   validated. If the unit deploys more than one C2 communications system, (i.e., PSC-5,
   PRC-117F), they may elect to activate systems simultaneously or sequentially. If systems
   are activated sequentially, additional S-hour(s) for subsequent systems must be coordinated

          4.6.3.3. The inspected unit will not make improvements to the system between activation time
          and flight inspection. If flight inspection is available, maintenance personnel may make
          adjustments to correct initial azimuth errors. If flight inspection is not possible due to outside
          constraints, the Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) will be awarded a rating based on the capa-
          bilities of the TACAN at activation time.
