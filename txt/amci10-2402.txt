     (SITREPs) and Event/Incident Reports (OPREP-3).
     1.2.5. Develop, communicate, and maintain up to and including Top Secret sensitive
     compartmented information (SCI), DCI-related data.
     1.2.6. Develop requirements for an integrated risk management strategy that provides the
     foundation to manage risk associated with discrete AF critical assets (CA) within AMC.
     1.2.7. Define responsibilities, procedures, and standards to assist commanders with
     identification, validation, and prioritization of CAs and assess, determine, and manage risk to
     these assets in an all-hazard/threat environment.
AMCI10-2402 10 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                     5


1.3. Mission. The AMC CARM program mission is to:
   1.3.1. Assure global execution of AMC core capabilities, functions and missions by
   identifying assets and infrastructure dependencies whose loss or degradation would impact
   execution of mission essential tasks and functions.
   1.3.2. Assess vulnerabilities and determine risk of loss to CAs and infrastructures.
   1.3.3. Protect and secure CAs through a comprehensive risk management program in
   conjunction with security-related and continuity of operations disciplines.
1.4. Program Policy. AMC CARM policy will:
   1.4.1. Establish and implement a comprehensive program that provides centralized program
   management for resources, strategy, planning guidance, oversight, and capabilities (e.g.,
   standardized, complementary analytic methods and tools) with decentralized execution of
   CARM throughout AMC.
   1.4.2. Share AMC CARM program data about CA risks with other DOD and AF agencies
   responsible for complementary programs and efforts.
   1.4.3. Ensure risk is determined through a standardized risk assessment methodology.
   1.4.4. Use the CA identification process outlined in DODM 3020.45V1 to identify mission-
   based (function-based for Defense Infrastructure Sector Lead Agencies (DISLA)) CAs and
   Supporting Infrastructure Critical Assets (SICA). Collaborate and coordinate with
   Combatant Commands, Defense Agencies, and DISLAs, as necessary, to identify and
   validate CAs and SICAs in support of Mission Essential Functions (MEF) and Mission
   Essential Tasks (MET).
   1.4.5. Nominate recommendations to AF for, and monitor the results of, CA vulnerability
   and risk assessments; risk response actions; and additions, changes, or deletions to the CA
   list.
   1.4.6. Complement other DOD programs, functions, and activities that contribute to mission
   assurance through risk management as outlined in DODD 3020.40.

    Establish necessary lines of communication to promote information sharing with each of
    these programs, as appropriate.
    1.4.9. Identify, validate and focus risk management activities on discrete assets and
    supporting infrastructures deemed critical to the execution of Combatant Command and
    DOD Component assigned missions, as well as AMC core functions.
    1.4.10. Identify, validate, and prioritize core elements of AMC CARM in the baseline
    budget generated through the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System
    (PPBES) to execute a comprehensive program fully integrated with DOD and National level
    programs. These core elements are:
       1.4.10.1. Program and fund sufficient manpower to establish and execute a viable
       program at the MAJCOM and installation level.
       1.4.10.2. Establish and implement CARM Standards and Benchmarks (including
       associated metrics) to enable AMC/IPC Staff Assistance Visits (SAV) and installation
       Self-Inspections. Initiate and conduct compliance evaluations of AMC CARM through
       the AMC/IG to determine the program’s overall effectiveness.
       1.4.10.3. Support the AF Critical Asset Risk Assessment (CARA) process that identifies
       DCI vulnerabilities and risks through the use of approved DCIP and AF supplemental
       Standards and Benchmarks, including system and network vulnerabilities, to ensure
       consistent and comprehensive assessment practices. Each AF CARA will result in:
           1.4.10.3.1. Analysis of the DCI system design, operation, and supporting
           infrastructure for the purpose of identifying risks and vulnerabilities.
           1.4.10.3.2. Assessment of vulnerabilities and risks to damage mechanisms associated
           with the DCI threat/hazard profile, taking into account factors of susceptibility,
           accessibility, and existing countermeasures; the identified effect of vulnerability
           exploitation; and recommended courses of action.
           1.4.10.3.3. Open source information research to the greatest extent possible when
           conducting a DCI analysis and area characterization.
       1.4.10.4. Support a long-term strategy for CARM Outreach, Education, Training,
       Exercises goals and objectives.
       1.4.10.5. Use the Air Force Critical Asset Management System (AF-CAMS) to manage
       and track CA. AF-CAMS is the authoritative AF CARM data management system
       supporting identification, validation, assessment, and risk management of CAs and
       supports the review and nomination of AF Defense Critical Asset (DCA) candidates to
       the JS and Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense & Americas’ Security
       Affairs (ASD (HD&ASA)).
    1.4.11. Establish partnerships with other Services, federal government agencies, state and
    local governments, and the private sector to address CARM Program issues and inter-
    dependencies.
    1.4.12. Develop, coordinate and execute an AMC CARM process of Inform, Train and
    Exercise. The goals of this process are to inform the stakeholder community within AMC
AMCI10-2402 10 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 7


   about the importance of CARM through efforts such as expanding the reach of CARM into
   existing commander orientation courses and installation commander orientations.
1.5. Program Characteristics. AMC CARM focuses on CAs which can include assets owned
by the DOD, state and local governments, U.S. commercial/private sector, foreign
commercial/private sector, and host nations. However, with the exception of the U.S.
commercial/private sector, this Instruction does not apply to these outside AMC agencies. AMC
installations must interface with outside agencies like commercial service providers. CARM
seeks to maintain and utilize existing relationships while seeking to establish new ones. In
addition, AMC CARM will:
   1.5.1. Coordinate and collaborate CARM data analysis with DOD and non-DOD EM
   planners to assist in quantifying impacts to mission essential tasks and functions caused by
   the loss or degradation of CAs in an ―all hazard/threat‖ environment.
   1.5.2. Support joint efforts by all DOD activities, Federal and State civilian agencies, and
   our commercial partners, both home and abroad to determine CA dependencies.
   1.5.3. Consider non-DOD assets that are often essential to the execution of AMC missions as
   a cause for concern and require special attention. AMC equipment, facilities, utilities,
   services, transportation, weapon systems, and other assets that support projection of our
   forces and capabilities may be highly dependent upon assets owned and/or operated by
   entities other than AMC, AF or DOD.
   1.5.4. Advance value to mission assurance by improving operational readiness, identifying
   previously unknown vulnerabilities, risks and dependencies, and improving the decision
   support environment for decision makers and senior leaders. These efforts support the
   efficient allocation of scarce resources for managing risk to CAs and are a means to reduce
   the impact of asymmetric threats.

AMCI10-2402 10 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                   11


     2.3.3.1. Prioritize critical assets and risks to ensure lists are synergized between multiple
     functional areas and plans (i.e. installation force protection and continuity of operations).
     2.3.3.2. Identify, prioritize and validate respective CARM resource requirements on a
     fiscal year basis through the Installation Program Objective Memorandum (POM)
     process. Coordinate these requirements with AMC/IPC.
     2.3.3.3. Assess risk associated with CAs/SICAs using the AMC Targeted Risk Analysis
     (TRA) decision support tool and apply mitigation measures.
     2.3.3.4. Use all available and applicable funding programs to correct deficiencies when
     resulting risk is unacceptable and requires funding support. Options include but are not
     limited to:
        2.3.3.4.1. Planning, Programming and Budget Execution (PPB&E).
        2.3.3.4.2. Operation and Maintenance (O&M).
        2.3.3.4.3. Combating Terrorism Readiness Initiatives Fund (CbTRIF) and Combatant
        Commanders Initiatives Fund (CCIF). While the PPBE is traditionally used for long-
        term planning, CbTRIF and CCIF are designed to correct vulnerabilities that require
        immediate action. Because PPBE requests will not be available for two to five years
        IAW the normal POM funding cycles, commanders are encouraged to participate in
        the CbTRIF and CCIF programs. Information on the PPBE process can be found in
        the DOD Management Initiative Decision 913.
        2.3.3.4.4. When faced with emergency or emergent risks that could not reasonably
        have been anticipated or programmed through the PPB&E, submit to the Chairman of
        the Joint Chiefs of Staff through the appropriate GCC CbTRIF/CCIF requests
        pursuant to the requirements specified in CJCSI 5261.01C and CJCSI 7401.01E,
        respectively.    Projects submitted for CbTRIF/CCIF must have compelling
        justification. Utilize information contained in HHQ reports and or classified data-
        based programs (CARA/JSIVA/AFVA/AFCAMS/CVAMP/etc) if applicable.
        2.3.3.4.5. CbTRIF: This program was established by Congress and is managed by
        the Joint Staff (J-3). It provides funds for emergency or unforeseen emergent high
        priority force protection projects or equipment. An Emergency CbTRIF Requirement
        is defined as an unanticipated requirement created by a combination of circumstances
        or the resulting state that requires immediate action to prevent, deter, or respond to a
        terrorist act. An Emergent CbTRIF Requirement is a newly formed, unexpected
        requirement resulting from a logical consequence of unforeseen circumstances calling
        for prompt action. It is designed for requirements that need to be funded in the
        current fiscal year and provides a means for the Geographic Combatant Commander
        (GCC) to react to unforeseen requirements from changes in a terrorist threat, threat
        levels, force protection doctrine/standards, as well as unanticipated requirements
        identified as a result of a Vulnerability Assessment (VA), tactical operations and
        exercising AT Plans. If maintenance funds for CbTRIF projects are not programmed
        and provided from the parent Service, CbTRIF can be used to fund maintenance costs
        for those CbTRIF-funded items during the year of purchase and the subsequent year
        as a temporary measure to permit the Service adequate time to program life-cycle
        costs. The fund is not intended to subsidize ongoing projects, supplement budget
 12                                                       AMCI10-2402 10 NOVEMBER 2011


          shortfalls, or support routine activities, which are a Service responsibility. Requests
          must be submitted through the responsible MAJCOM and GCC, per GCC policies, to
          the Joint Staff. To eligible for CbTRIF, a vulnerability must be entered into the Core
          Vulnerability Assessment Management Program (CVAMP) to receive funding.
          2.3.3.4.6. CCIF: The primary purpose of CCIF is to support unforeseen contingency
          requirements critical to combatant commands' joint warfighting readiness and
          national security interest. The strongest candidates for approval are initiatives that
          support combatant command activities and functions, enhance interoperability and
          yield high benefit at low cost. CCIF provided a means for combatant commanders to
          react to unexpected contingencies and opportunities. It is not intended primarily to
          subsidize ongoing projects, supplemental budget shortfalls, or support Service
          component expenses that are normally the responsibility of the parent Service. To
          eligible for CCIF, a vulnerability must be entered into CVAMP to receive funding.
          2.3.3.4.7. Many Program Element Codes (PEC) and/or funding appropriations (FA)
          (AT, Physical Security, EM, Medical, Construction, Base Defense, Base Operating
          Support, Communications, etc) may be used to fund FP resourcing activities.
          Commanders will consider all PEC and FA sources as authorized by law and AF
          policy and guidance.
          2.3.3.4.8. In AMC another avenue for funding projects with CARM implications
          revolves around the two semi-annual data-call conducted by AMC/A7P. The data-
          calls go out to the installation CE requesting projects they want to be considered for
          Special Straddle Authority (SSA) and Normal Straddle Authority (NSA). From
          inception of the project planners must consider the impact of Tier-I/II/III assets.
          Where CARM assets are involved, planners shall document ACES with the
          applicable Infrastructure Code.
          2.3.3.4.9. While not a funding venue, there are organizations that can aid the
          commander in identifying technology to satisfy requirements: The Physical Security
          Equipment Action Group (PSEAG), the Technical Support Working Group (TSWG),
          AFSFC Concepts Division, Air Force C-CBRN Working Group, Joint Requirement
          Office (JRO) and the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD). These
          organizations are separately funded to provide COTS information, rapid prototyping,
          and research and development and/or evaluation of solutions for units in the field.
          They can provide information and research on technology and equipment evaluated
          and deemed suitable for your purpose. Additionally, they can provide field
          assessments to assist in identifying the optimal solutions to meet your requirements.
   2.3.4. Report changes in the operational status of Tiers I – III CAs outlined in OPREP-3 and
   SITREP reporting mechanisms IAW AFI 10-206. Include AMC/IPC in the address line.
   2.3.5. Prioritize and address risks to identified CAs supporting installation/tenant missions.

                 AMC CARM PROGRAM CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS

3.1. Overview. The AMC CARM Program Concept of Operations is based on:
   3.1.1. Integrating CARM into programming, planning, budgeting, and execution of AMC
   mission essential functions and tasks at all levels of command.
   3.1.2. Identifying assets critical to the execution of AMC missions, core functions and
   capabilities, whether owned by the AF, other DOD components, governmental entities or the
   private sector as outlined in DODI 3020.45.
   3.1.3. Conducting all-threats/hazards analysis, addressing the full range of probable threats
   and hazards, both natural and man-made that allow exploitation of vulnerabilities to CAs.
   3.1.4. Conducting risk assessments to determine the level of risk associated with the loss of
   CAs. Take the following three elements into account:
       3.1.4.1. The impact of the loss of CAs on all missions and capabilities supported by
       those assets.
       3.1.4.2. The likely or probable threats and hazards, both natural and man-made.
       3.1.4.3. The degree of existing vulnerabilities.
   3.1.5. Prioritizing risk of loss for all CAs located on AMC installations.
   3.1.6. Identifying and prioritizing remediation and mitigation options for reducing risk to
   CAs.
   3.1.7. Determining to accept risk or implement remediation or mitigation options designed
   to reduce risk of loss to CAs.
   3.1.8. Identifying, prioritizing and submitting resource requirements for remediation and
   mitigation of risk to AMC CAs.
   3.1.9. Ensuring risk remediation and mitigation strategies are incorporated into
   disaster/emergency response and continuity of operations plans.
3.2. CARA Management Strategy. The AF CARM program establishes a comprehensive,
integrated risk management strategy for all levels of AF command in accordance with DODD
3020.40, DODI 3020.45 and AFPD 10-24. It identifies roles and responsibilities supporting risk
management decisions involving AMC critical assets. CARM includes development of adaptive
plans and procedures to mitigate risk of loss, restore capability in the event of loss or
degradation, support incident management, and protect CARM related information. The CARA
process is the primary AF tool to manage risk for critical assets. Refer to Attachment 2, AF
CARA Management Strategy, for additional guidance.
   3.2.1. A complete risk assessment process consists of four components:
       3.2.1.1. Criticality as a determination of the impact on all mission essential tasks or
       functions caused by the loss of a critical asset.
 16                                                       AMCI10-2402 10 NOVEMBER 2011


       3.2.1.2. All Threat/Hazards to include any man-made or naturally occurring event and
       the likelihood or probability of the threat or hazard occurring.
       3.2.1.3. Vulnerability of the critical asset to applicable threats/hazards, to include the
       degree of vulnerability.
       3.2.1.4. Quantifiable and repeatable expression of risk of loss.
   3.2.2. CARA provides an integrated risk assessment to determine CA risk of loss.
       3.2.2.1. Determine risk based on the formula of: Risk = Criticality X Threats/Hazards
       X Vulnerabilities.
       3.2.2.2. Assess Criticality/Threat and Hazard/Vulnerability within the same timeframe.
       3.2.2.3. Provide and document remediation or mitigation options designed to lower risk,
       not just eliminate vulnerability.
3.3. CARM Processes and Guidelines. CARM complements AT, Integrated Defense Risk
Management, and EM All-Hazards processes and guidelines. It uses an ―all threats/hazards‖
approach and captures mission impact and criticality factors to provide installation commanders
a complete critical asset assessment. The collection of risk and vulnerability assessments
pertaining to Tier I-III critical assets must be documented in AF-CAMS within 30 days of
assessment completion.
   3.3.1. AF CARA Process and Guidelines. (Refer to Attachment 3, AF CARA Standards and
   Area of Concern (AOC) for additional information.) AMC commanders and CARM
   program managers must assess risk of loss to critical assets that support AF and DOD
   activities. AMC CARM will use AF CARA processes and guidelines embedded in AF-
   CAMS to assess risk of loss to AMC Tier I - III critical assets. CARA processes and
   guidelines produce data to support command risk management decisions for critical assets.
   Consider CARA data as it relates to other force protection disciplines such as AT, Integrated
   Defense, EM, et al., identifying and prioritizing risk to all people and assets at a given
   location – not just risk to critical assets. A CARA provides commanders a valuable subset of
   information to aid with identification and management of overall risk. Use CARA processes
   and guidelines to:
       3.3.1.1. Assess and prioritize discrete risk of loss to, or among, identified CAs to discrete
       threats and hazards.
       3.3.1.2. . Identify all-threats and hazards. Assess and prioritize likely and probable
       threats and hazards exploiting CA vulnerabilities.
       3.3.1.3. . Identify and prioritize vulnerabilities, to include identifying degrees of
       vulnerability to CAs.
       3.3.1.4. Identify and prioritize remediation and mitigation measures addressing
       installation risk of loss, vice an isolated focus on eliminating or reducing vulnerabilities
       to CAs.
   3.3.2. Critical Asset Identification. Critical assets are systems and assets so vital the
   incapacity or destruction of such systems or assets would have a debilitating impact on the
   command’s ability to execute its operational missions, capabilities and tasks, to include
   organize, train and equip functions. Asset criticality is determined based solely on the assets’
AMCI10-2402 10 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                      17


  impact to execution of a mission essential task or function the asset supports. Include
  identified impacts due to unavailability of an asset where no other asset exists that is capable
  of meeting the mission requirement, for any reason, resulting in failure or significant
  degradation in execution of mission tasks, core capabilities or functions.
      3.3.2.1. Critical assets are defined in DODM 3020.45V1.
          3.3.2.1.1. Tier I CA. An asset the loss, incapacitation, or disruption of which could
          result in mission (or function) failure at the DOD, Military Department, Combatant
          Commander, sub-unified command, Defense Agency, or DISLA level.
          3.3.2.1.2. Tier II CA. An asset the loss, incapacitation, or disruption of which could
          result in mission (or function) severe degradation at the DOD, Military Department,
          Combatant Commander, sub-unified command, Defense Agency, or DISLA level.
          3.3.2.1.3. Tier III CA. An asset the loss, incapacitation, or disruption of which could
          result in mission (or function) failure or severe degradation below the Military
          Department, Combatant Commander, sub-unified command, Defense Agency, or
          DISLA level.
      3.3.2.2. Identify potential CAs through existing assessment methodologies, changes to
      mission essential tasks or functions, new or revised operational plans, changes in the ―all-
      hazard‖ threat and/or contemporary operating environment, exercise or real-world after-
      action reports and lessons learned, et al. Vet proposed CAs to the installation commander
      through the CARM working group.
  3.3.3. Critical Asset Validation. Validate potential CAs by:
      3.3.3.1. Confirming and documenting mission essential tasks and functions assigned to,
      and executed by the host wing and tenant organizations located on an AMC installation
      or an AMC unit at a geographically separated location outside the command. CAs
      cannot exist without an associated mission essential task or function.
      3.3.3.2. Documenting CAs and associated data points for any AMC mission essential
      task or function.

      3.3.4.3. Time from asset capability loss to impact on supported MEFs/METs.
      3.3.4.4. Number of MEFs/METs (and operational plans) supported by the critical asset.
      3.3.4.5. Level of function impact.
   3.3.5. Risk Management Response. Installation commanders need comprehensive risk
   assessment data to make an informed risk management decision. Use the AMC/IPC
   Targeted Risk Analysis decision support tool to capture and document commanders’
   decisions to remediate, mitigate or accept risk for Tier I - III CAs. Refer to Attachment 4,
   Targeted Risk Analysis, for additional information. All classified data will be in compliance
   with the DCIP Security Classification Guide.
      3.3.5.1. Commanders will document and report their risk management decisions to
      AMC/IPC as outlined below:
          3.3.5.1.1. Accept Risk – The installation commander, through the CARM working
          group, has determined the level of risk is acceptable, or there are inadequate resources
          available to mitigate/remediate the risk.
          3.3.5.1.2. Remediate Risk – The installation commander, through the CARM
          working group, has a remediation project or documented plan to lower risk to the
          critical asset, not just eliminate a vulnerability or threat/hazard.
          3.3.5.1.3. Mitigate Risk – The installation commander, through the CARM working
          group, has developed a mitigation plan and strategy to off-set vulnerabilities or
          threat/hazards to a critical asset after an event occurs. The plan will include
          restoration and reconstitution of the critical asset’s capabilities or functions.
      3.3.5.2. Send risk response decisions to AMC/IPC within 10 days of installation
      commander approval. AMC/IPC will assist installation CARM manager with AF-CAMS
      inputs as needed.
      3.3.5.3. Risk decision documentation should include:
          3.3.5.3.1. Risk Reduction Alternatives Considered. Include a summary of risk
          reduction alternatives, expected risk reduction effectiveness for each alternative, and
          estimates for time/investment needed to implement alternative.
          3.3.5.3.2. Investment Requirement. Identify funding required and available to
          implement project through FYDP.
          3.3.5.3.3. Final Decision Documented.        Document justification for any risk
          acceptance decision. Include a summary of facts that render risk acceptance such as
          likelihood of threat/hazard occurrence, insignificant vulnerabilities, or programmed
          capability changes or other alternative solutions expected to reduce risk to an
          acceptable level in the future. Consider safety risk guidelines within MIL-STD -
          882D.
3.4. CARM Working Group. Installation CARM managers will establish a CARM working
group.
AMCI10-2402 10 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                     19


   3.4.1. Membership. The working group should include, as a minimum, subject matter
   experts from Communications, Civil Engineers, Antiterrorism, Security Forces, EM, Plans
   and Programs (specifically for COOP and/or Mission Assurance), AFOSI, Intelligence, and
   any organization possessing identified critical assets (to include non-DOD agencies where
   possible). The installation commander will designate an O5/O6 chairperson for the working
   group.
   3.4.2. Meeting Frequency. The CARM working group will meet at least semi-annually or as
   needed to address changes in the operational status of critical assets.
   3.4.3. Working Group Agenda and Products. The CARM manager will manage and
   facilitate the working group for the installation commander and designated chairperson.
   Identify installation agenda and products in local guidelines.
   3.4.4. Working Group Charter. The CARM manager will establish and publish a working
   group charter.
3.5. Self-Inspection and Staff Assistance Visit Requirements. Installations (and AMC tenant
organizations where applicable) will conduct CARM self-inspection to evaluate effectiveness of
CARM implementation and compliance with this instruction. Self-inspections will be comprised
of CARM SAV and a CARA self-assessment. AMC/IPC will periodically compile and
disseminate SAV trends.
   3.5.1. Self-Inspection. Installations (and AMC tenant organizations as needed) will conduct
   a CARA self-assessment (Refer to Attachment 3). Conduct self-inspections in accordance
   with the installation self-inspection program, when there are significant changes to the
   threat/ hazard or contemporary operating environment, there are changes/additions to
   existing mission essential tasks or functions, or CONOPs or other operational plans have
   changed. (Note: Any of the aforementioned occurrences could indicate a change in status to
   existing, or the addition of newly identified, critical assets. Installations will receive credit
   for CARA self-assessment as a result of an AF conducted CARA, dating from the time of
   completion.
   3.5.2. Staff Assistance Visits. AMC/IPC will conduct an on-site SAV at least biennially at
   installations\AMC tenant organizations, or as needed. Installation CARM managers will
   conduct an internal program review at least annually in the out-years between the AMC/IPC
   SAV’s. Use AMC/IPC, AF CARM standards and benchmarks, associated metrics, and the
   CARA assessment tool to conduct the SAV(Refer to Attachment 2). Note: AMC/IPC will
   coordinate SAV’s with AMC/IG and the AMC Gatekeeper.
   3.5.3. Self-Inspection and SAV Reports.         Prepare and manage after-action reports as
   outlined in Chapter 4.
3.6. Outreach, Education and Training, and Exercise. AMC strategy is to institutionalize
CARM through existing internal and external resources.
   3.6.1. Internal Outreach. The process begins with outreach, which has the purpose of
   informing the stakeholder community within AMC about the importance of AF CARM to
   mission success. Socialize the AMC CARM Program with stakeholders by:
20                                                    AMCI10-2402 10 NOVEMBER 2011


     3.6.1.1. Incorporating CARM program training to squadron commanders, e.g. during
     squadron commander orientation seminars, and group and installation commanders
     through group and installation commander courses.
     3.6.1.2. Facilitating outreach through use of appropriate tools including: videos,
     briefings, newsletters, brochures on specific topics, handouts and other means.
  3.6.2. Education and Training. Outreach creates awareness but only through education and
  training is it possible to build organizational competence needed to carry out assigned
  responsibilities. A comprehensive curriculum is essential to the success of the AMC CARM
  risk management program.
  3.6.3. Exercise.    Exercise CARM with the objective of turning competence into
  demonstrated capability and identifying where additional instruction is needed. Installation
  CARM managers will participate with exercise development, planning, execution, review,
  and analysis of exercise results. CARM installation managers will ensure that CARM injects
  are input during Exercise Evaluation Team (EET) activity. Document and incorporate
  CARM ―lessons learned‖ from operations, training, and exercises. Utilize the JLLIS to
  capture theses lessons in a searchable database. The lessons can be entered into JLLIS as an
  AAR or as individual observations and recommendations (O&R). Ensure lessons learned are
  incorporated into CARM processes and activities addressing the protection, survivability and
  assurance of CAs.
AMCI10-2402 10 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                   21


                                           Chapter 4

                                  REPORT PROCEDURES

4.1. Purpose. This chapter establishes guidance for the preparation, coordination and
submission of reports that fall within the purview of the AMC CARM program and mandated by
AFI 10-206 and this Instruction.
4.2. OPREP-3 (RCS: HAF-A3O(AR) 7118).
   4.2.1. Command Posts (CPs) use OPREP-3s to immediately notify commanders of any
   significant event or incident that rises to the level of DOD, AF, or MAJCOM interests.
   OPREP-3 reports do not replace the requirement for more detailed reports such as the
   Aircrew/Aircraft Loss Report (LOSREP), the SITREP, and accident or incident investigation
   reports. Submitting an OPREP-3 report does not change nor is a substitute for any report
   required by other directives.
   4.2.2. OPREP-3 reports categorize events or incidents according to their nature.
   FLAGWORDs associated with each category aid prompt transmission, processing, and
   distribution of the reports by alerting people to their importance.
   4.2.3. Due to the time sensitivity of OPREP-3 information, each event/incident will be
   reported as promptly and accurately as possible. If there is doubt, report it. For changes in
   the normal operational status of Tiers I – III CAs, where a change is due to an unplanned
   event that results in a CA being destroyed or severely degraded, the installation CARM
   program managers will ensure that the asset owners coordinate changes with the installation
   CP and Commander. Report changes using existing OPREP-3 reporting mechanisms.
   Formulate and submit reports as prescribed by AFI 10-206 and this instruction. The CARM
   program manager will report changes in the normal operational status of CAs in AF-CAMS
   as safety permits.
4.3. SITREP (RCS: HAF-A3O (AR) 7123).
   4.3.1. The purpose of the SITREP is to keep the Services, JS, and SECDEF apprised of
   existing political, military, and operational situations/plans and to keep commanders advised
   of a unit’s ability to meet requirements outlined in approved plans.
   4.3.2. SITREPs must be timely, concise, and include sufficient information to allow
   leadership to fully understand the situation and make timely decisions. Minimally, SITREPs
   should include current status from asset owners, threats to critical infrastructure, mitigation
   measures and restoration estimates.
   4.3.3. The installation CARM manager will ensure an asset owner coordinates with the
   installation CP and Commander when significant operational deficiencies of a Tier I – III CA
   have occurred that affect mission readiness. A SITREP report will be submitted as outlined
   in AFI 10-206, AMC and Installation directives.
4.4. After-Action Reports.
   4.4.1. AMC/IPC Staff Assistant Visit Reports. AMC/IPC will produce written reports
   within 30 days upon conclusion of the SAV. Reports will specifically document gaps and
   shortfalls in the execution of AMC CARM program tasks and requirements outlined in the
22                                                     AMCI10-2402 10 NOVEMBER 2011


  CARM program standards, as well as recommendations for addressing identified gaps and
  shortfalls. The after-action report will be submitted to the installation CARM office and the
  installation commander. An executive summary will be prepared for 18th AF/CC and
  AMC/CV review. The installation commander retains release authority of final reports.
  4.4.2. Installation CARM managers will:
     4.4.2.1. Input program review results into AF-CAMs or other database as available, to
     track and monitor corrective actions generated by the report.
     4.4.2.2. Brief the installation commander and specific asset owners, through the CARM
     working group, on the final report and results of the program review.
     4.4.2.3. Develop corrective actions and risk mitigation strategies (in conjunction with the
     CARM working group) to address observations and concerns noted by AMC/IPC.
     4.4.2.4. Coordinate with AMC/IPC and continually update AF-CAMs (or other
     databases used) to track corrective actions until completion.
  4.4.3. AF CARA Reports (Report Control Symbol (RCS) DD-POL (AR) 2294)).
     4.4.3.1. The AF/A3O-AH CARM program office will produce written reports within 60
     days of the assessment. The report will specifically document gaps and shortfalls in the
     execution of AF CARM Program tasks and requirements outlined in the CARM and
     CARA Standards and Benchmarks as well as recommendations for addressing identified
     gaps and shortfalls.
     4.4.3.2. The after-action report will be submitted to the Installation Commander with
     information copies to AMC/IPC, and other DOD stakeholders with an interest in the
     mission or CA. These include: OASD (HD & ASA) and the Joint Staff (J-34) for DCAs,
     Combatant Commander/defense agencies, AF/A4/7 and other organizations.
     4.4.3.3. The installation CARM office receiving the report will document the findings of
     the report in AF-CAMS within 30 days of receipt of the report, and respond to the
     AF/A3O-AH CARM Program office through the appropriate command channels, within
     90 days of receipt of the report. The response to the report will include a proposed plan
     of action to remediate noted deficiencies as developed by the asset owner, and
     recommended by the owning Installation Commander and AMC. Where the command
     has decided to accept risk, that decision must be documented in the plan of action. The
     Installation report and proposed plan of action will be classified in accordance to the
     provisions of the DCIP Security Classification Guide, or any DODM Security
     Classification Manuals that supersede this referenced guide, and the Defense Threat
     Reduction Agency (JSIVA) Security Classification Guide.
AMCI10-2402 10 NOVEMBER 2011                                                             23

Terms
All-Hazards/Threats Environment—An environment that includes natural or man-made
incidents and events to include acts of terror.
Asset (Infrastructure)—A Distinguishable network entity that provides a service of capability.
Assets are people, physical entities, or information located either within or outside the United
States and owned or operated by domestic, foreign, public or private sector organizations.
Critical Asset Prioritization Methodology (CAPM)—Purpose of CAPM is to generate a
mission-focused, repeatable methodology to standardize the critical-asset prioritization process.
The CAPM is designed to provide the following results:
a. An algorithm to compute a ―Total Priority Value (TPV)‖ for any single CA.

b. A prioritized list of CAs that can be utilized at all DOD command levels.

c. An impact value, which is the critical asset’s TPV, to support risk assessments of CAs and
supported missions.
Continuity of Operations (COOP)—Internal effort within individual components of the
Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Branches of Government assuring the capability exists to
continue uninterrupted essential component functions across a wide range of potential
AMCI10-2402 10 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                    29


emergencies, including localized acts of nature, accidents, and technological and/or attack-
related emergencies. COOP involves plans and capabilities that must be maintained at a high
level of readiness, and be capable of implementation with or without warning. (DODD 3020.26
and AFI 10-208).
Defense Critical Asset (DCA)—A TCA that is of such extraordinary importance to DOD
operations in peace, crisis, and war that its incapacitation or destruction would have a very
serious, debilitating effect on the ability of the Department of Defense to fulfill its missions.
(DODD 3020.40).

documents; and to safeguard them against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft (JP1-02).
Reconstitution—Directed Owner/operator-restoration of CA.
Remediation—Directed actions taken to correct known deficiencies and weaknesses. These
actions are undertaken once vulnerability has been identified, but before an event occurs that
could exploit those vulnerabilities (DODD 3020.40).
Risk—Combination including the probability of an undesirable event occurring and the
consequence of that undesirable event. Risk is quantified by multiplying Impact or Criticality
times Threat/Hazard times Vulnerability.
Risk Assessment—Systematic examination of risk using disciplined processes, methods, and
tools. It provides an environment for decision making to continuously evaluate and prioritize
risks and recommended strategies to remediate or mitigate those risks.
Risk Management—Process by which CA risk is assessed and calculated using the Risk
formula, and commanders analyze the risk to their critical assets and make the decision to accept
or remediate/mitigate that risk.
Supporting Infrastructure Critical Asset (SICA)—A Supporting Infrastructure Asset (SIA)
that is directly used to support the functioning or operation of a TCA, such that the SIA’s loss,
degradation, or denial will result in the inability of the TCA to function or operate as intended in
the execution of its associated MET or function. In other words, a TCA cannot operate or
function without a SICA being available or functioning.
Task Critical Asset (TCA)—An asset that is of such extraordinary importance that its
incapacitation or destruction would have a very serious, debilitating effect on the ability to
execute the task it supports.
Threat—Adversary having the intent, capability, and opportunity to cause loss or damage.
(DODD 3020.40, Defense Critical Infrastructure Program)
Vulnerability (Infrastructure)—Characteristics of an installation, system, asset, application, or
its dependencies that could cause it to suffer a degradation or loss (incapacity to perform its
designated function) as a result of having been subjected to a certain level of threat or hazard.

                         AF CARA MANAGEMENT STRATEGY

A2.1. CARA Requirements. A CARA is conducted to identify hazards, threats, and
vulnerabilities to critical assets as well as supporting a defined risk management approach to
ensure the continued operation of those assets.
   A2.1.1. Assessments will help determine and identify support requirements and how to
   integrate those needs into base-wide contingency plans.
   A2.1.2. Conduct of a risk assessment is focused on identifying risk of loss to critical assets
   and infrastructure dependencies, vice producing or focusing on a list of vulnerabilities.
   A2.1.3. CARAs employ an all-hazards approach and consider impact, threat/hazard, and
   degree of vulnerability when identifying risk to critical assets.
   A2.1.4. Use AF CARA Standards and Benchmarks, primary Areas of Concerns (AOCs), and
   AMC CARM program office planning guidance where applicable, to conduct these
   assessments. The AOCs are: physical security and planning, operational security (OPSEC)
   and planning, supporting infrastructure networks and supporting material and services, EM,
   plans and safety, information assurance, information security, foundational infrastructure
   networks (electric, communications, POL, water, waste and HVAC), and mission analysis.
   The information protection structure established by the Air Force Information Protection
   CONOPS can be leveraged to combine related disciplines.
A2.2. CARA Scheduling and Timelines.
   A2.2.1. AF Conducted HHQ CARA. The conduct of an AF CARA is required once every
   three years on all Tiers I – II AF CAs. The AF/A3O-AH CARM Program office will
   coordinate with the AMC CARM program office during the January/February timeframe of
   each year to initially nominate and schedule an AF CARA. This will be done in conjunction
   with the Air Force Vulnerability Assessment (AFVA) and Joint Staff Integrated
   Vulnerability Assessment (JSIVA) scheduling process for the following calendar year. The
   final schedule will be published during the August/September timeframe of each year.
   A2.2.2. Installation CARA Self-Assessment. The Installation CARM Program office will
   coordinate through the Installation CARM Program WG or equivalent, and conduct a self-
   assessment on all Tiers I - III TCAs. This self-assessment will be conducted by Installation
   designated functional (SMEs) on a biennial basis as part of an Installation and AF Tenant
   CARM Program self-inspection. In addition, a supplemental or partial CARA self-
   assessment may be required if an event, such as, a new or additional mission comes to the
   installation.
A2.3. CARA Team Composition and Mission Requirement. The CARA teams will be
comprised of and conduct the following:
   A2.3.1. CARA Team Composition.
       A2.3.1.1. AF/A3O-AH CARA Team Composition. The AF CARA Team will be
       comprised of a minimum of seven personnel with a mix of functional SMEs based on the
       Tiers I - II CAs and AOCs to be assessed. The AOCs are reflected in Paragraph A3.1.4.
AMCI10-2402 10 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 33


     A2.3.1.2. Installation CARA Self-Assessment Team. The Installation CARA Self-
     Assessment Team will include an appropriate number and mix of functional SMEs based
     on the assigned TCAs, SICAs, and the disciplines reflected in Paragraph A3.1.4.
  A2.3.2. CARA Mission Requirement:
     A2.3.2.1. Assess and validate criticality, threats and hazards, and vulnerabilities to CAs
     and infrastructure dependencies and their cascading effects.
     A2.3.2.2. Review and evaluate installation security, antiterrorism, force protection,
     continuity, EM, and other contingency plans to ensure CAs have been considered.
     A2.3.2.3. Conduct interviews with installation key staff and functional SMEs to
     individually review and evaluate internal operations and program compliance in the
     specific CARA AOCs. These interviews will not impede operational requirements.
     A2.3.2.4. Conduct on-site observations of installation operations.
     A2.3.2.5. Produce a final report that provides a prioritized risk of loss to CAs and impact
     on specific missions, functions and tasks, as well as recommendations on risk
     remediation and mitigation actions for the assessed CAs. Refer to Chapter 5 regarding
     CARA after-action reports.

consideration of potential vulnerabilities inherent in the infrastructure grids upon which the CAs
reside and from which the asset is supported. Key infrastructure grids include power sources
(i.e., natural gas, petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL) and electric); transportation networks (i.e.,
rail, roads, air and seaports); communications (i.e., electronic voice and data communications);
water (i.e., potable, firefighting, industrial and wastewater); and chemicals. Additionally, the
availability of supporting infrastructure includes the consideration of potential vulnerabilities
inherent in the commercial support to CAs, including supplier contractual obligations regarding
the production, transport, and security material and services during both peacetime and periods
of conflict. Attention must be paid to the ownership and control of companies providing
commercial support to CAs.

                             TARGETED RISK ANALYSIS (TRA)

A4.1. CARM Program Managers, in conjunction with specific critical asset owners and the
CARM working group, should use the TRA to complete an ―all-hazards‖ analysis involving
critical assets and supporting infrastructure. Complete a TRA Worksheet (See Figure A4.1.) for
each individual critical asset.
A4.2. All Threats & Hazards List. Most AMC installations have been doing threat analysis for
many years and have built comprehensive lists of likely, potential, or feasible threat scenarios.
However, there are quite a few lists which are not complete. As a consequence, potential or
likely hazards that could impact CARM critical assets (CAs) are not always considered. The
following lists were developed to assist analysts/planners with their CA risk analysis, rather than
starting from scratch. They are meant as ―starting points‖ but are not all-inclusive lists and can
be modified to suit specific locations. Planners must realize there is no 100 percent solution and
they need to evaluate the likelihood of each hazard and threat, even if the likelihood of a certain
scenario or hazard is zero at the time of the analysis; it still should be considered because it could
create a secondary or tertiary impact. For example, the chance of a volcano at Fairchild AFB is
slight, but if there’s a volcano near McChord, they may have to divert aircraft to Fairchild or
they might have to close Fairchild because of volcanic plumes caused by winds.

A4.3. Critical Asset Risk Analysis Checklist.
A4.3.1. Phase 1 – Risk Assessment (RA).―What Are YOUR Threats?‖
       A4.3.1.1. Hazards + Threats (Column 1). Identify (and list) all possible threats and
       hazards for your location. See Tables A4.1 and A4.2.
          A4.3.1.1.1. Did the analysis consider all probable or feasible hazards/threats?
                A4.3.1.1.1.1. Even if their likelihood is unknown?
                A4.3.1.1.1.2. Unique to your location?
          A4.3.1.1.2. Was the installation        Threat   Working    Group    consulted    when
          developing/validating the list?
       A4.3.1.2. Probability of Threat/Hazard (Column 2). Score each Threat/Hazard
       identified in Column 1. Assign probability values as: High = 5, Medium = 3, Low = 1.
          A4.3.1.2.1. Did each line item receive a minimum score of 1?
          A4.3.1.2.2. Did each line item have an explanation that describes how the probability
          was determined?
          A4.3.1.2.3. Consequence/Impact (Column 3). Indicate what happens if the critical
          asset fails using one of the following numerical values: Failure = 5, Mission
          Degradation = 3, No Impact = 0.
                A4.3.1.2.3.1. Assign a score of ―5‖ when consequences result in mission or task
                failure (inability to meet one or more ―standards‖ associated with the task).
                A4.3.1.2.3.2. Assign a score of ―3‖ when the consequences result in mission
                degradation (able to meet all ―standards‖ associated with MET, but unable to
                meet all ―conditions‖ associated with that task). (Note: Mission Failure or
                Degradation is determined by the asset owner.)
          A4.3.1.2.4. Risk Factor Score (Column 4 - Automated).
                A4.3.1.2.4.1. The formula provides a ―Risk Factor‖ for the hazard/or threat plus
                a cumulative score (at the bottom) which is the overall ―Asset Risk Score‖. This
                will help determine what should receive the most attention.
                A4.3.1.2.4.2. Insert the appropriate color-code for each category (See example
                TRA worksheet).

  A4.3.2. Phase 2 – Risk Management (RM). Phase 2 describes decisions and actions to
  resolve the Threat/Hazard to a critical asset. Recommendations are to Accept, Remediate
  (activities AFTER an event to lessen the impact), or Mitigate (action/plans developed
  BEFORE an event) the risk.
     A4.3.2.1. Risk Response (Column 5). Identify ALL options to lower the risk to this
     asset.
        A4.3.2.1.1. Explain what could be done; what is the trade-off in terms of cost and
        benefits; what impact could these actions have on future efforts to mitigate this risk.
        A4.3.2.1.2. Describe the commander’s justification to Accept, Mitigate or Remediate
        the risk. Use blank paper if more space is needed and classify as needed.
     A4.3.2.2. Risk Management Action (Column 6). Record the option that describes the
     response/action plan to resolve the risk to the critical asset and document the installation
     commander’s approval/disapproval of the risk management action plan.
  A4.3.3. Adjustments.
     A4.3.3.1. Adjusted Consequence (Column 7). Indicate estimated numerical score
     AFTER risk management actions (Column 6) are completed.
     A4.3.3.2. Adjusted Risk Factor (Column 8 – Automated). The TRA work sheet
     provides a new risk factor. Insert the appropriate color code (See the TRA Worksheet for
     example).
     A4.3.3.3. Status (Column 9). Indicate the date and action anytime a new event takes
     place.

                  AF CARM PROGRAM REVIEW (PR) STANDARDS

A5.1. Background.
   A5.1.1. DOD DCIP guidance includes program review standards that are specifically
   applicable to the military departments/services. The standards included in this attachment
   represent the AF intent to meet the DCIP requirement to implement a measurable and
   compliant CARM Program.
   A5.1.2. Measuring the program at an enterprise level will assist senior AF leadership with
   program and funding justifications and decisions.
A5.2. Purpose.
   A5.2.1. AF CARM Program Standards have been developed to:
      A5.2.1.1. Formalize and standardize how the AF will assess and rate implementation of
      key program requirements.
      A5.2.1.2. Establish accountability for certain actions taken or not taken with respect to
      CAs.
      A5.2.1.3. Measure the internal progress of AF CARM Program.
      A5.2.1.4. Support compliance with DOD DCIP Standards and Benchmarks.
   A5.2.2. AMC/IPC will apply AMC requirements to AF CARM guidelines. They will
   coordinate with AMC/IG to establish, approve and publish AMC CARM Program inspection
   checklists and post them on the AMC/IG website.
A5.3. AF CARM Program Standards Goals. Goals for implementation of formal CARM
standards and benchmarks include:
      A5.3.1.1. AF/A3O-AH CARM Program office will conduct annual PRs of each
      MAJCOM CARM Program office.
      A5.3.1.2. The AF/A3O-AH CARM program office will annually review the AF PR
      process to assess and evaluate the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the process and
      implementation documents. AMC/IPC will provide recommendations and comments
      pertaining to the process to the AF/A3O-AH CARM Program office NLT 31 October of
      each year.
      A5.3.1.3. AMC/IPC will schedule and conduct an on-site program review of subordinate
      units on a biennial basis, with a virtual staff assistance visit performed each alternate
      year.
      A5.3.1.4. Installations will develop and conduct an integrated two-year self-inspection
      program, comprised of an annual CARM PR and biennial CARA self-assessment.
