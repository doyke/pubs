1. Objective.
    1.1. The objective of the Installation Fire Prevention—Fire Protection Program is to eliminate poten-
    tial causes of fire, while reducing loss of life, injuries, property damage, and environmental impact,
    should fire occur. Accomplishing these objectives is vital if the mission is to continue. To reach these
    objectives, it is necessary to reduce unsafe practices and conditions. This is done through the educa-
    tion of all personnel, command support at all levels, and enforcement of fire-safe practices and codes
    established by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). Therefore, fire prevention and safety
    will not be compromised for reasons of expediency or economy.

2. Program Authority.
    2.1. Base Fire Marshal. The Base Civil Engineer, 305 CES/CC, is the staff officer designated as the
    Base Fire Marshal and serves as the subject matter expert to the 305 AMW/CC, who is the appointed
    Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ), IAW AFI 32-2001, The Fire Protection Operations and Fire
    Prevention Program, and paragraph 1.7.3.1. In this capacity, the Base Fire Marshal is authorized to
    stop operations or processes considered to be a fire, life, or explosive safety hazard. The Base Fire
    Marshal also serves as the base’s primary advisor on Fire & Emergency Services (F&ES) matters, and
    supervises the Fire Chief and the F&ES Flight.
    2.2. Fire Chief. The F&ES Flight Chief, 305 CES/CEF, is designated as the Fire Chief, and is respon-
    sible to the Base Fire Marshal for establishing and managing an effective fire protection and preven-
    tion program. The Fire Chief develops and administers the Installation Fire Prevention-Protection
    Program through the Assistant Fire Chief of Fire Prevention.
       2.2.1. The Fire Chief or Senior Fire Officer has full authority over all fire suppression and rescue
       operations.
       2.2.2. The On-Scene Commander (OSC) may establish priorities based on prevailing conditions;
       however, no one outside the fire protection organization will give orders or interfere with the Fire
       Chief or firefighters in the performance of fire suppression or rescue operations.

3. Program Responsibilities.
    3.1. Functional Managers. The functional manager is the commander or designated senior operating
    official at any level who exercises managerial control of an activity or operation. Functional manag-
    ers are responsible for administering the Installation Fire Prevention-Protection program within their
    functional area and for initiating corrective action on fire hazards and fire deficiencies. In addition,
    functional managers are responsible for notifying the Fire Prevention Section in writing of changes in
    facility managers, their alternates, and their telephone numbers.
    3.2. Unit Commanders are responsible at all levels for ensuring sound fire prevention procedures are
    established and practiced in each activity or facility under their jurisdiction. They will enforce this
    instruction as it pertains to the buildings, areas, and property under their control. Unit Commanders
    will direct all of their supervisors to:
       3.2.1. Ensure all personnel are knowledgeable of required fire and emergency reporting proce-
       dures, proper use of fire extinguishers, and sound fire prevention and protection practices.
