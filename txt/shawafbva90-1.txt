                         INSPECTOR GENERAL
                        COMPLAINTS PROGRAM
All Air Force military and civilian employees have a duty to promptly report Fraud, Waste and
Abuse or gross mismanagement; a violation of law, policy, procedures, or regulations; an injustice;
abuse of authority, inappropriate conduct, or misconduct (as defined by AFI 90-301); and a
deficiency or like condition, through appropriate supervisory channels, to an IG or other appropriate
inspector, or through an established grievance channel. Complaints may be filed in person, by letter,
or through a complaint hotline. Complainants may remain anonymous if they so desire.

You have the right to submit a complaint at any level, from the wing IG up to and including the
Department of Defense IG. However, complaints are best resolved using the chain of command, as
commanders have a vested interest in resolving issues that impact unit morale and mission
effectiveness.

                                                                                 If you think action
