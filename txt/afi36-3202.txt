      MEMORANDUM FOR DISTRIBUTION C
      MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs

      FROM: Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Manpower and Reserve Affairs)

      SUBJECT: Air Force Guidance Memorandum to Air Force Instruction 36-3202, Separation Documents

      References: (a) DoDI, 1336.01, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (DD Form
         214/5 Series)
         (b) AFI 36-3202, Separation Documents

      This Air Force Guidance Memorandum immediately implements changes to Air Force Instruction 36-3202,
      Separation Documents. Compliance with this Memorandum is mandatory. To the extent its directions are
      inconsistent with other Air Force publications, the information herein prevails, in accordance with AFI 33-360,
      Publications and Forms Management.

      The Department of Defense has approved DD Form 214 format changes for the Air Reserve Components (Atch 1).
      Changes to Air Force Instruction 36-3202, Separation Documents, include documentation of multiple periods of
      active duty by Air Force Reserve Components members ordered to active duty for a contingency operation on a
      single DD Form 214, with the following conditions:

      1. The dates of all active duty periods being documented and the contingency operation supported during each
      active duty period must be listed in the DD Form 214 Block 18, Remarks, or on the DD Form 214C.
      2. The type separation, character of service, separation authority, separation code, reentry
      code and narrative reason for separation must be identical for all of the active duty periods being documented on the
      single DD Form 214.

      Attachment 2 provides guidance for cumulative DD Form 214 processing along with an OSD coordinated sample
      DD Form 214, documenting both contingency and non-contingency periods of active duty, along with processing
      instructions and excerpts from AFI 36-3202.

      This memorandum becomes void after 1 year has elapsed from the date of this memorandum, or upon publication of
      an Interim change or a rewrite of the affected publication, whichever is earlier.



                                                                     DANIEL R. SITTERLY

                                             Guidance
   Issue a single cumulative DD Form 214 to:
      document periods of active duty service in direct support of contingency
       operations upon accumulation of 90 days or more, member's transfer to
       another component, separation, retirement, or by member's request
      document periods of active duty service for non-contingency of 90 days or
       more service or member's transfer to another component, separation, or
       retirement
   The above guidance is in compliance with the signed ETP and DoDI 1336.01,
    para 3.j.(1) on page 12 that states:
   "The 'from' date shall be the date of initial entry into active duty, or the first
    day of service for which a DD Form 214 was not previously issued, as
    applicable“
   Ensure DD Forms 214 do not overlap – Check PRDA for DD Forms 214
    processed within the periods of active service (12a and 12b). If there is a DD
    Form 214 on record, process a separate form for the previous, and
    subsequent, periods of active duty not previously covered

Section A—Citing Authority

1. Authority for Separation. Members who separate from active service are issued separation
documents as authorized by the law (Attachment 1) and DOD and United States (US) Air Force
(USAF) separation policies and procedures. Do not cite this instruction as an authority for
separation. AFI 36-2102, Base-Level Relocation Procedures, tells how to process a member for
separation at base level. The War and Mobilization Procedures are in Attachment 2.

Section B—Preparing the Documents

2. What Are Separation Documents Used For?
    2.1. DD Form 256AF, Honorable Discharge, is used to discharge members who separate
    from the AF with an honorable characterization and not released to the Reserve components.
    Members who fulfill their obligation with the reserve forces are issued this certificate when
    discharged with an honorable service characterization. This certificate is issued to all active
    duty enlisted members who reenlist within 24 hours of their separation.
    2.2. DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge From Active Duty, meets the legal
    requirements for issuing a discharge certificate (Title 10, U.S.C., section 1168) and:
       2.2.1. Provides the military services with information about military personnel for
       administrative purposes.
       2.2.2. Helps determine eligibility for reenlistment.
       2.2.3. Provides separating members with brief, clear records of their active military
       service at the time they are transferred, released, discharged, or retired.
       2.2.4. Provides government agencies with information they need to administer the
       federal and state laws that apply to persons who have been discharged, otherwise
       released, or transferred to a Reserve component.
    2.3. DD Form 214WS helps personnel to prepare DD Form 214 and to make sure the data
    entered on the form is accurate.
    2.4. DD Form 215, Correction to DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge
    From Active Duty, corrects errors found after a DD Form 214 is issued or completes a DD
    Form 214 with up-to-date information. Only the agencies listed in Table 1. and paragraph
    18.2. may prepare this form.
3. Who Issues Separation Documents?
    3.1. Normally, the MPF issues discharge or release-from-active-duty separation documents.
    Exceptions are:
AFI36-3202 22 NOVEMBER 2005                                                                     5


      3.1.1. Retirements Branch (HQ AFPC/DPPRR), and HQ Air Reserve Personnel Center,
      Reference Services Branch (HQ ARPC/DRSS), issue separation documents when they
      are instructed to do so by the AF Board of Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR) or
      the AF Discharge Review Board (AFDRB).
      3.1.2. HQ AFPC/DPPDS issues discharge certificates (DD Forms 256AF) to members
      who are removed from the temporary disability retired list (TDRL) and discharged; or
      according to the guidelines contained in AFI 36-2602, Active Duty Service
      Determinations for Civilian or Contractual Groups.
      3.1.3. The Air National Guard of the US (ANGUS) or USAF Reserve (USAFR)
      servicing MPF or ARPC/DR (for individual mobilization augmentees [IMA]) that
      services the unit of assignment prepares DD Form 214 in accordance with paragraph 4.1.
      for Air Reserve Component (ARC) member who completes 90 continuous calendar days
      or more of active duty or active duty for training (ADT), or an initial active duty training
      tour.

       issued a DD Form regardless of the number of days served. The requirement to complete
       a DD Form 214 due to mobilization is outlined in AFI 10-416, Personnel Readiness and
       Mobilization.
       4.5.2. Members who complete 90 continuous calendar days or more of active duty or

5. Preparing DD Form 214.
    5.1. Separating agencies ask individuals to complete DD Form 214WS, if applicable.
    5.2. Prepare the DD Form 214 worksheet using the unit personnel records group (UPRG)
    information contained in the report of individual personnel (RIP) from AFPC. Make sure the
    individual has reviewed the RIP.
    5.3. Use the training documents obtained from the member. Ask the local office of primary
    responsibility (OPR) to help resolve questions about particular data items. Review the data
    entered on the worksheet to be sure it is right before copying it on the DD Form 214.
    5.4. Use Table 4. to complete DD Form 214. Put an entry in every item on the form.
    5.5. Type all entries on the DD Form 214 except the signature. Do not use abbreviations
    except as shown in Table 4. Be sure that the copies of DD Form 214 that you send to
    government agencies, especially the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of
    Labor, are clear and easy to read.
6. Continuation Sheets.
    6.1. If the data for items 1 through 17 takes up more space than is allowed, enter as much as
    possible and note that it is continued on item 18 by stating “(SEE REMARKS)”. If you need
    more space, continue on plain white bond paper. For the continuation sheet format, see
    Attachment 3. Make a note at item 18 that there is further information on the continuation
    sheet (see Table 4.).
    6.2. Do not make a continuation sheet just to note how copies 3 and 5 will be distributed.
    Make these entries on the reverse side of copy 2.
    6.3. Do not put entries for items 23 through 30 on the continuation sheet.
7. Incomplete DD Form 214.
    7.1. Do not delay a member's separation just because you don't have all the information
    needed for DD Form 214.
AFI36-3202 22 NOVEMBER 2005                                                                     7


   7.2. Try to get the missing information. Ask the member's last servicing MPF or send a
   request by message (MINIMIZE included) to HQ AFPC/DPPRR.
   7.3. If you cannot get the data through the Personnel Data System (PDS) or one of these
   sources, fill out DD Form 214 as completely as possible. If you are the MPF Personnel
   Relocation Element or other separating activity:
      7.3.1. Tell the separating member that the appropriate agency (see Table 1.) will issue
      DD Form 215 when it gets the information it needs.
      7.3.2. Tell the separating member to contact that agency if the member doesn't receive
      the DD Form 215 within 60 days.
      7.3.3. Note on the DD Form 214, item 18 (Remarks Section) that DD Form 215 is being
      issued.
      7.3.4. Obtain the missing information as soon as possible.
      7.3.5. If you are still missing information for DD Form 215, write a memorandum
      explaining why you need the DD Form 215 and what you did to try to get the missing
      information. The MPF chief or a similar official in another separation facility signs this
      memorandum. Staple the memorandum to the front of the unit personnel record group
      (UPRG) before forwarding it according to AFI 36-2608, Military Personnel Records
      System.
   7.4. DD Form 214 is an important record of service. Prepare it as completely and accurately
   as possible.
      7.4.1. Items 1, 3, 4, 12, and 18 through 30, and DD Form 215, items 1, 3, 5, and 7, are
      overprinted with a reproducible screen tint using security ink to make alterations readily
      discernible. Make no corrections in the screened items.
      7.4.2. Make sure that unavoidable corrections or changes in the unshaded items are neat,
      easy to read, and initialed on all copies by the authenticating official. Do not change any
      of the copies after the original has been delivered. Tell the recipient that any changes or
      alterations will void the DD Form 214.

Section C—Controlling Forms and Codes

8. Controlling DD Forms 214 and 215.
   8.1. DD Forms 214 and 215 are important to former members who seek veterans' benefits,
   reemployment rights, and unemployment insurance. They provide authoritative information
   to civilian and government agencies, who use it to validate veterans' eligibility for benefits.
   Because they are important and sensitive forms, they are vulnerable to fraud. Transmit,
   store, and destroy them in a way that prevents unauthorized use. Do not discard intact forms.
   8.2. DD Form 214WS is marked worksheet on the body of the form. Treat this form as you
   would DD Form 214.
   8.3. The MPF commander or a comparable official of each unit or activity and of the
   agencies listed in Table 1., appoints in writing a commissioned officer, noncommissioned
8                                                            AFI36-3202 22 NOVEMBER 2005


    officer (staff sergeant or above), or civilian (general schedule [GS]-7or above) to control
    blank DD Forms 214 and 215 (see Table 4., rule 39).
       8.3.1. The person responsible for controlling blank forms secures all forms after duty
       hours; destroys all obsolete forms; clearly voids forms that are given to personnel for
       training or instruction; and destroys discarded forms, including those that are blank or
       partially completed, and any reproduced copies of DD Form 214.
9. Controlling Separation Program Designator (SPD) Codes.
    9.1. SPD codes identify the type of separation for officers and airmen and the reason for
    separation. They are intended solely for internal use by DOD and are not intended to
    stigmatize individuals. The DOD uses them to compile separation statistics, collect and
    analyze data, and help determine whether personnel policies need to change.
    9.2. You must stamp all lists of SPD codes "For Official Use Only", including those used in
    MPF elements, according to AF Supp/DOD 5400.7, DOD Freedom of Information Act
    Program/Air Force Supplement. Do not give them to any agency or person outside the
    DOD. Use the Freedom of Information Act (Title 5, U.S.C., section 552[b][2], Public
    Information; Agency Rules, Opinions, Orders, Records, and Proceedings) as authority to
    keep the lists from the public. See AF Supp/DoD Regulation 5400.7 for denying access.
    9.3. Separating members are entitled to know their own SPD code. The code appears on
    copy 4 of the DD Form 214 that you give to the separating member.
    9.4. SPD codes do not show all the circumstances relating to a separation. For this reason,
    and because codes may be outdated, you must not use them for any unauthorized purpose.

Section D—Distributing Separation Documents

10. Distributing DD Form 214.
    10.1. Because the DD Form 214 is the document that separates a member from the AF
    (Title10, U.S.C., section 1168 and paragraph 14), or ARC members, you must not issue it
    before the date of separation. Treat DD Form 214 Worksheet the same as the DD Form 214.
    Hand the original DD Form 214 and copy 4 to the separating member before he or she leaves
    the separation facility on either the date that separation from active duty is effective, or the
    date when authorized travel time starts for a Reserve member reverting to inactive status.
       10.1.1. Have the member initial DD Form 214, item 30, for receipt of copy 4.
       10.1.2. Explain to members that copy 4:
           10.1.2.1. Is valuable as an official record.
           10.1.2.2. Shows their service characterization, their eligibility for reenlistment, and
           the reason for their separation.
           10.1.2.3. Shows information the Department of Veterans' Affairs and state
           unemployment offices need in order to determine their eligibility for benefits based
           on their military service. Members who do not have copy 4 must wait for their
           eligibility to be verified.
AFI36-3202 22 NOVEMBER 2005                                                                     9


          10.1.2.4. Is useful in asking for a review of the discharge action or seeking to reenter
          one of the Armed Forces.
       10.1.3. When it is not possible to deliver the original DD Form 214 personally to the
       separating member on the effective date of separation, mail it. Mail the original when the
       member is on leave, at home awaiting disability separation, in civil confinement, or
       separated in absentia.
       10.1.4. For an incompetent member, deliver the original in person or by mail to the next
       of kin or guardian.
   10.2. Mail legible copies 3, 5, and 6 on the first workday after the separation date (see Table
   5.). NOTE: The MPF or responsible office must mail these forms punctually and are not
   accumulated over a period of time before they are mailed. For HQ ARPC, distribution is
   done the day the DD Form 214 is issued.
   10.3. If the member is an alien discharged in absentia or a naturalized member discharged
   under other than honorable conditions, refer to Section H.
   10.4. Upon receipt of the final supplementary court-martial order to separate a member on
   appellate review leave, DD Form 214 must be accomplished and mailed immediately, but no
   later than 15 days from date of receipt of the court-martial order. Guidance for preparing the
   DD Form 214 is found in Table 4. Provide the base SJA a copy of the DD Form 214 for their
   records. NOTE: Reference AFI 36-3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen, paragraphs
   2.15. and 3.7. DD Forms 214 will not be issued to members separating under these
   paragraphs until the member has enlisted in the USAFR, or when the oath of office or
   enlistment in another branch of service has been executed.
11. Distributing Other Separation Documents.
   11.1. See AFI 33-328, Administrative Orders, for preparing and distributing separation
   orders.
   11.2. Give or mail the discharge certificate to the member with the original DD Form 214.
   Commanders may choose to present the certificate (paragraph 17.).
   11.3. See AFI 36-3203 for instructions on how to deliver retirement certificates.
12. Undeliverable Separation Documents.
   12.1. If the MPF cannot deliver separation documents to the member, mail them to HQ
   AFPC/ DPFFCMR (Attachment 1). Explain in the transmittal memorandum why you did not
   deliver the documents as required by paragraphs 10. and 11.
   12.2. The AF Reserve sends undeliverable discharge certificates to HQ ARPC/DSMP.
   ARPC files them in the master military personnel record before shipping the record to the
   National Personnel Records Center (NPRC).
   12.3. The Air National Guard MPF sends undeliverable discharge/separation documents and
   or certificates to HQ ARPC/DPSF for inclusion in the master personnel records.
13. Replacing Separation Certificates. AFI 36-2608 tells how and where to apply for a
certificate in lieu of a lost or destroyed certificate of service, discharge, or retirement.
10                                                           AFI36-3202 22 NOVEMBER 2005


Section E—Separation Procedures

14. Effective Time. Separation is effective at 2400 on the date of separation; however, for
Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) purposes, separation is effective when the member
receives the discharge certificate (either DD Form 214 or 256AF, or both) and final pay is made
ready (Title 10, U.S.C, section 1168). If the MPF finds out before then that the member, for
whatever reason, will not separate, then destroy the separation documents. Prepare new
documents when the member is separated.
15. Where Members Are Separated.
     15.1. Usually, members serving in the Continental United States (CONUS) are separated at
     the duty base or the nearest base that can process the separation. If the duty base cannot
     process the separation, the members are placed on temporary duty (TDY) at the nearest base
     that can process the separation. They do not need to make a special trip to pick up the
     separation documents. The base sends these papers to the commander for delivery on the
     date that the separation is effective.
     15.2. Members serving overseas have two options where they may separate or retire other
     than in the overseas area (paragraph 16). Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam are not considered
     overseas for separation purposes. Assigned Military Personnel Flights/Sections separate
     members there.
        15.2.1. Under option 1, most members will complete separation or retirement processing
        at the overseas base and travel directly to final destination unless approval is granted for
        travel to a Separation Processing Base (SPB).
            15.2.1.1. Members normally agree to take at least 5 days of terminal leave or
            permissive TDY immediately preceding the date of separation (DOS) or retirement.
            This ensures the member completes the final travel to the US prior to date of
            separation or retirement. If a member desires separation in the overseas area, the
            MPF/S will ensure that the member has completed the requirements outlined in
            paragraph 16.
            15.2.1.2. Overseas MPF/S accomplishes separation requirements with the exception
            of preparing the DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty.
            15.2.1.3. (DELETED)
        15.2.2. Under option 2, travel may be authorized to a SPB. A SPB is an Air Force base
        in the CONUS with a MPF/S and Financial Services Office (FSO) nearest to the
        member’s projected HOS. If support facilities do not exist at the member’s overseas
        location, a hardship exists that warrants travel to a separation processing base (SPB), or
        travel to a SPB would be in the best interest of the Air Force, member will submit a
        request, which includes full justification and concurrence of the member’s commander, to
        HQ AFPC/DPSD (for members who are being medically separated or retired), HQ
        AFPC/DPSOS (for separating members), HQ AFPC/DPSOR (for retiring colonels and
        below) or AF/DPG (for retiring general officers and general officer selectees) as
        appropriate. If approved, the approving authority will determine the appropriate SPB
        closest to the member’s HOS and prepare travel orders directing movement.
AFI36-3202 22 NOVEMBER 2005                                                                   11


          15.2.2.1. HQ AFPC/DPSD (for members who are being medically separated or
          retired), HQ AFPC/DPSOS (for separating members), HQ AFPC/DPSOR (for
          retiring colonels and below) or AF/DPG (for retiring general officers and general
          officer selectees) publishes PCS without PCA orders on separating or retiring
          members approved for travel to a SPB. For all other members separating or retiring
          from overseas, the orders publishing authority includes appropriate travel
          authorizations on the separation or retirement order.
          15.2.2.2. If member is authorized travel to SPB, the overseas MPF/S notifies the SPB
          MPF/S by email or message at least 5 workdays before member’s departure, or as
          soon as flight information is known, providing arrival date, retirement effective date,
          PTDY, terminal leave, and any other pertinent data.
          15.2.2.3. The MPF/S ensures member’s projected departure from the overseas area
          allows member to report to SPB, if applicable, no earlier than 3 workdays, and no
          later than 1 workday before start of permissive TDY, terminal leave, or date of
          separation, as applicable.
          15.2.2.4. Overseas bases will out-process the member prior to departure. Final out-
          processing at the overseas base includes the preparation and authentication of the AF
          IMT 100, Request and Authorization for Separation.
          15.2.2.5. Overseas MPF/Ss give the stateside processing base a minimum of a 5-
          workday notice of the arrival of the separating member.
          15.2.2.6. Stateside processing base acknowledges receipt of the notification message
          and notifies the losing MPF/S within 72 hours after scheduled arrival date of the
          failure of a member to report for separation or retirement.
   15.3. Members will not be allowed to separate or retire overseas without meeting host
   country residency requirements prior to their projected date of separation. Overseas Military
   Personnel Flight/Section (MPF/Ss) ensure members meet country requirements or ensure
   members have made proper arrangements to depart the overseas location. MPF/Ss ensure
   members not taking permissive TDY or terminal leave in conjunction with separation or
   retirement depart the overseas area with sufficient travel time to reach the CONUS by their
   separation or retirement. If a member’s travel is delayed due to a missed flight, etc, and the
   member will not be able to reach the CONUS before the projected date of separation, the
   MPF/S must contact the orders publishing authority as soon as possible for processing
   instructions.
   15.4. The overseas MPF/S ensures member has contacted HQ AFPC/DPSOY regarding
   preparation of DD Form 214. HQ AFPC/DPSOY will provide member with completed DD
   Form 214 after retirement effective date to avoid legal and jurisdictional problems, along
   with violation of the Status of Forces Agreement the US government has with the host
   country.
16. Requests for Separation in Overseas Areas.
   16.1. Members serving in an overseas area may wish to separate there. To separate
   overseas, the member requests separation in writing to unit commander; agrees to let the AF
   give information from the records to authorities of the foreign government (see paragraph
12                                                            AFI36-3202 22 NOVEMBER 2005


     19.4.); and shows that he or she has met all the requirements of the applicable status-of-
     forces agreement and that authorities of the country concerned do not object.
        16.1.1. These procedures do not apply to members serving in Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, or
        US possessions or territories; non-CONUS residents serving in their home state or
        territory; and members who will continue to serve on active duty in another status.
     16.2. Overseas MAJCOMs set local rules for applying for separation. MAJCOMs may
     approve or disapprove applications except when the member is being separated for security
     reasons; substantial evidence exists that separation in the foreign country would adversely
     affect the security interests of the US; and the member is serving a sentence in a foreign
     penal institution. In these instances, send requests to HQ AFPC/DPPRS.
        16.2.1. MAJCOMs may delegate this authority to commanders who exercise special
        court-martial convening authority. Disapproval authority may not be further delegated.
        The special court-martial authority may delegate approval authority to the base director
        of personnel.
     16.3. Do not separate members in a foreign country until they have the documents they need
     to stay in the country legally. Command supplements must tell which documents are needed
     in each country and they must refer to applicable laws.
     16.4. Do not allow members to go to another overseas base just to be separated in a more
     desirable place.
     16.5. Tell members who ask for separation in an overseas area that they will no longer have
     logistical support privileges. Tell them how long they will be entitled to return transportation
     to CONUS at government expense.
17. Departure Ceremony.
     17.1. The MPF personnel relocation office notifies the immediate commander when
     preparing to separate a member. If it is appropriate, the commander expresses the AF’
     appreciation for the member's service. The commander in an overseas unit of assignment
     makes this gesture for members who will separate on their return to CONUS. CONUS
     commanders may choose to present the discharge certificate to the separating member.
     17.2. Some ways to recognize service or express appreciation are recommending the
     member for an award (AFI 36-2803, The Air Force Awards and Decorations Program);
     delivering a memorandum of appreciation from the immediate or higher commander or both;
     and giving a personal expression of farewell from the immediate commander.

Section F—Post Separation Procedures

18. Correcting DD Form 214.
     18.1. Once a DD Form 214 has been issued, do not reissue it unless you receive a request in
     writing and one of the following applies:
        18.1.1. You are directed to do so by an appellate authority, by Executive Order, or by the
        Office of the Secretary of the AF.
        18.1.2. Data in items 24, 25, 26, 28, or 29 needs correction.
AFI36-3202 22 NOVEMBER 2005                                                                    13


      18.1.3. In order to correct or complete the original DD Form 214, you will need to issue
      more than one DD Form 215.
      18.1.4. Two DD Forms 215 have already been issued and further correction is needed.
      18.1.5. A second DD Form 215 changes the same item as the first DD Form 215 or an
      existing DD Form 215 contains incorrect information.
   18.2. Completing DD Form 215.
      18.2.1. Items 1 through 4 show the information found on the original DD Form 214,
      even if it is incorrect on the original DD Form 214. 18.2.2. Separation date should match
      that in item 12b on the DD Form 214, even if it is incorrect. Make corrections as
      necessary in block 5 of the DD Form 215.

Section G—Status of Discharge

20. Requesting the Reason for Discharge.
     20.1. A former member may take an original DD Form 214 to the nearest MPF to get an
     explanation of the reason for discharge from a given period of service.
     20.2. If the MPF can determine the reason for separation from the DD Form 214, the
     personnel relocation element gives the member a memorandum of explanation from a person
     authorized to sign DD Forms 214 (for the memorandum format, see Figure 1.); returns the
     original DD Form 214 to the member along with the original memorandum; sends a copy of
     the memorandum to the custodian of the MPerR (see Table 1.).
     20.3. If the MPF cannot find the reason for separation in DD Form 214, the MPF personnel
     relocation element refers the request to HQ AFPC/DPPRS by sending the original DD Form
     214, the member's mailing address, and a copy of the separation order, if one is available,
     and notifies the person of the referral.
21. Reviewing a Discharge.

Section H—Naturalized Personnel and Aliens

22. Naturalized Personnel Separated Under Other Than Honorable Conditions.

   specified periods (see AFPAM 211-28, Naturalization and Citizenship, and Title 8, U.S.C.,
   Aliens and Nationality Section 1440). Such individuals may have their citizenship revoked if
   they are separated under other than honorable conditions.
   22.2. When a naturalized member is separated under other than honorable conditions, the

   live in a foreign country. In such cases the alien typically may not return to the US as an
   immigrant alien. If you are in charge of the separating facility in such a case:
      23.1.1. Send a copy of the original DD Form 214 to the Department of State Visa Office
      (Attachment 1). Enter the place of birth in item 18. The memorandum of transmittal
      explains that the person was discharged in absentia for alienage and desertion.
      23.1.2. Report the details of the discharge to the INS (Attachment 1). Account for
      disclosure of personal data as required by AFI 33-332. State in the memorandum that the
      airman was discharged for alienage and desertion and give dates of the unauthorized
      absence; the member's full name, address, and social security number (SSN); country of

Terms
Active Duty—Full time duty in a military service of the United States. A general term applied
to all active military service, including full-time National Guard duty, without regard to duration
or purpose.
Active Duty for Training—A tour of active duty that is used to train members of the Reserve
Components. It provides trained units and qualified persons to fill the needs of the Armed Forces
in time of war or national emergency and such other times as the national security requires. The
member must return to nonactive status after the period of active duty for training (ADT). ADT
includes annual training, special tour of ADT, school tours, and the initial duty for training
performed by nonprior service enlistees.
Active Duty Guard and Reserve—All personnel of the National Guard and Reserve Forces
serving on extended active duty (under Title 10, U.S.C., or full-time National Guard duty under
Title 32, U.S.C.).
Airman—An enlisted person in the US Air Force in any component.
Characterization of Service—A determination of a member's military behavior and
performance of duty during a specific period of service. Choices are honorable; under honorable
conditions (general); under other than honorable conditions; bad conduct; dishonorable; and
uncharacterized.
Continuous Active Military Service Date—Date from which a member has been in active
military service without a break.
Discharge—Severance from all military status. EXCEPTION: For a member of the Air
National Guard of the United States (ANGUS), discharge may be from the ANGUS only, with
concurrent transfer to the US Air Force Reserve for the remainder of a military service
obligation. It does not include dismissal as a result of trial by general court-martial or "dropped
from the rolls" of the Air Force under Title 10, U.S.C., 1161(b) or 1163(b).
AFI36-3202 22 NOVEMBER 2005                                                                       45


Extended Active Duty—A tour of active military service (usually for more than 90 days)
performed by a member of the Air Reserve components. Strength accountability for persons on
EAD changes from the Air Reserve components to the active force. Strength accountability does
not change for statutory tour officers on EAD in accordance with Title 10, U.S.C., 175, 678, 265,
8496, 8021, 8019, and 8038.
Honorable—The honorable characterization is appropriate when the quality of the airman's
service generally has met Air Force standards of acceptable conduct and performance of duty. It
may also be appropriate when a member's service is otherwise so meritorious that any other
characterization would be inappropriate. A member’s service must be honorable to be eligible
for retirement.
Initial Active Duty for Training—The first period of active duty for training prescribed by law
or regulation for nonprior service enlistees. It trains members in a military specialty.
Member—An officer, warrant officer, Air Force Academy cadet, or airman.
Noncontinental United States (Non—CONUS) Resident—A person whose official home of
record, as defined by the Joint Travel Regulations, is Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, US
Virgin Islands, American Samoa, or the Canal Zone (since 1 October 1979).
Officer—A commissioned or warrant officer of the Armed Forces.
Release—Separation from a void enlistment or induction that does not involve a regular
discharge. A DD Form 214 is issued but not a discharge certificate.
Release From Active Duty—End of active duty status. This term applies to members of the
Regular Air Force who are transferred to a Reserve component to complete their military service
obligations and to members of Reserve components who revert to inactive status in their Reserve
organizations.
Reserve Components—The Reserve components of the Air Force are the Air National Guard of
the US and the US Air Force Reserve. The three types of Air Reserve Forces are Ready Reserve,
Standby Reserve, and Retired Reserve.
RD—A Reserve Section Code which represents members assigned to the Inactive Ready
Reserve without a military service obligation (MSO).
Separation—A general term that includes discharge, release from active duty, release from
custody and control of the Armed Forces, or transfer to a Reserve component.
Temporary Disability Retired List—A list of physically unfit members whose disability has
not stabilized to the point where its severity, percent of disability, or ultimate disposition can be
accurately assessed.
Under Honorable Conditions (General)—If an airman's service has been honest and faithful, it
is appropriate to characterize as under honorable conditions (general). Characterization of
service as general is warranted when significant negative aspects of the airman's conduct or
performance of duty outweigh positive aspects of the airman's military record.
Under Other Than Honorable Conditions—An airman's service may be characterized as
under other than honorable conditions only if the member is given an opportunity for a hearing
by an administrative discharge board or requests discharge in lieu of trial by court-martial.
Characterization of service as under other than honorable conditions may be appropriate when
46                                                         AFI36-3202 22 NOVEMBER 2005


the reason for separation is based on a pattern of behavior or one or more acts or omissions that
constitute a significant departure from the conduct expected of airmen.

                       WAR AND MOBILIZATION PROCEDURES

A2.1. When authorized by the President of the United States or the Congress, the active force
may be expanded by mobilizing the Reserve Forces to satisfy an emergency requirement.
Usually under these circumstances, it is necessary to minimize the number of Air Force
personnel leaving active duty. The Government suspends certain officer and enlisted voluntary
and involuntary discharges, releases, and retirements.
A2.2. The President may suspend any provisions of law relating to promotion, retirement, or
separation applicable to any member of the Armed Forces whom the President determines to be
essential to the national security of the United States. The President may do so during any period
when members of a Reserve component are serving under an order to active duty authorized by
sections 12301, 12302 and 12303 of the U.S.C., Title 10.

                     DISCHARGE REVIEW FACT SHEET (SEE NOTE)

A5.1. What Is a Discharge Review? In a Discharge Review, your discharge is examined to
decide whether the Service discharged you correctly and whether your service was characterized
fairly. Discharge policies and procedures change from time to time. The Boards that review
discharges must consider these changes in reviewing your discharge. You may benefit from
these changes if you apply.
A5.2. Who Is Eligible To Apply for a Discharge Review? Former service members may
apply for a discharge review or correction of records. If the former service member has died or
is not mentally competent, the surviving spouse, next of kin, or legal representative may sign the
application but legal proof must accompany the application.
A5.3. How To Apply for a Discharge Review.
     A5.3.1. STEP 1: You can apply and present your case on your own but several national
     service organizations are available to help you. These organizations provide free counsel or
     a representative to assist you in your discharge review. The local chapters of these
     organizations (e.g., American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, Veterans' of Foreign
     Wars, Jewish War Veterans) can be found in the telephone directory.
     A5.3.2. STEP 2: You do not have to get a copy of your military records but they may help
     you to prepare your discharge appeal, to discuss your case with a counsel or representative,
     and to understand the official reason for your discharge. You can get a copy of your records
     at no charge. Use a SF 180, Request Pertaining to Military Records, to request a copy of
     your records. In section 2, number 1, of SF 180, write "complete service and records." In
     section 2, number 4, write "discharge review." Medical records are on file with the
     Department of Veterans Affairs.
     A5.3.3. STEP 3: Submit the right application form. There are two Air Force Boards that
     consider requests to change the characterization and reason for discharges, each of which
     requires a different application form. You should apply first to the Air Force Discharge
     Review Board (AFDRB) using DD Form 293. If the AFDRB's decision is unfavorable, you
     may apply to the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR) using DD
     Form 149, Application for Correction of Military Record Under the Provisions of Title 10,
     U.S.C., Section 1552.
     A5.3.4. STEP 3.1. If fewer than 15 years have elapsed since your discharge and you want to
     ask for a changed separation characterization, use a DD Form 293 to apply to the Air Force
     Discharge Review Board (AFDRB), if one of the following applies: your service was
     characterized as under honorable conditions (general), your service was characterized as
     UOTHC, you received a bad conduct discharge as the result of trial by special court-martial,
     or you want to change the reason and authority for discharge.
     A5.3.5. STEP 3.2. Use DD Form 149 to apply to the Air Force Board for Correction of
     Military Records (AFBCMR) if one of the following applies: you received an entry level
     separation; want to be reinstated; have been previously denied by the Discharge Review
     Board, were tried by a general court-martial and sentenced to dismissal or bad conduct or
     dishonorable discharge, feel your reenlistment code is incorrect or unjust or, fifteen years or
AFI36-3202 22 NOVEMBER 2005                                                                    59


   more have elapsed since you were discharged. NOTE: AFBCMR applications ordinarily
   must be submitted within three years of discovering errors or injustices in military records.
STEP 4: Once you have filled out as much of the form as you can, following the instructions on
the back, mail it to the address shown for your branch of service.
A5.4. Frequently Asked Questions.
   A5.4.1. Can I Review Previous Decisions of the Review Boards? Yes. There is an index of
   decisions of the Review Boards that might help you appeal your discharge. The index
   identifies cases that might be similar to yours and explains the Board’s rationale. Your state
   Veterans' Affairs Office or one of the service organizations listed on the DD Form 293 can
   tell you where to find the index. If you feel that the key to the index or prior cases would be
   helpful in your appeal, you can get copies by writing to:
       DA Military Review Boards Agency
      ATTN: Reading Room
      Crystal Mall 4, Second Floor
      1941 Jefferson Davis Highway
      Arlington, VA 22205
    Or, go on-line at: www.boards.law.af.mil
   A5.4.2. How Can I Get a Copy of the Instruction Under Which I Was Discharged?
    To get a copy of the pertinent part of the instruction under which you were discharged, as
    well as the current version of the instruction, write a memorandum indicating both your date
    of separation and the reason and (or) authority as shown on your official separation
    document. You can also obtain a copy of the instruction that guides the Review Boards
    procedures. Send the request to: NTIS, 5825 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161.
A5.4.3. Do I Have To Go to Washington for the Discharge Review? No. The Discharge Review
Board conducts reviews throughout the country. The Correction Board does not travel and only
conducts reviews in Washington. However, the Board rarely requires a veteran to travel to
Washington DC for a hearing.
   A5.4.4. Do I Have To Appear Before a Discharge Review Board in Person?
    No, but it may help if you do. You may also request that the Board decide whether to
    upgrade your discharge without a hearing, based on your military service record and any
    other information you send by mail. The back of the DD Form 293 discusses the types of
    reviews that are available.
   A5.4.5. Where Do I Send My Request for Discharge Review? The addresses to which the
   forms are to be submitted are listed on SF 180, and DD Forms 149 and 293. NOTE:
   Regardless of any action by a Discharge Review Board, a discharge under other than
   honorable conditions that resulted from a period of continuous unauthorized absence of 180
   days or more bars you from receiving benefits administered by the Department of Veterans'
   Affairs.
