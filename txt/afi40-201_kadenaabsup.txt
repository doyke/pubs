March 2011, is supplemented as follows: This publication implements AFI 40-201, AFI 48-148,
Ionizing Radiation Protection, and AFMAN 48-125, Personnel Ionizing Radiation Dosimetry. It
applies to all 18th Wing, tenant units, local and U.S. civilian employees and dependents, local
and foreign nationals (including guests, dignitaries, foreign and local government personnel,
contractors, and contractors by support agreement), and U.S. Forces (non-Air Force) personnel
