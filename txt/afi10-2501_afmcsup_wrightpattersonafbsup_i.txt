AFDD 2-4.1, Force Protection. It also aligns the Air Force with Homeland Security Presidential Directive
5 (HSPD-5), the National Incident Management System (NIMS), and the National Response Plan (NRP).
This instruction also implements the Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS) based on the
NIMS methodology and aligns Air Force EM planning and response with the NRP as directed by
HSPD-5. This instruction defines the Air Force EM program as a cross-functional program that integrates
procedures and standards for planning; logistical requirements; emergency response actions; emergency
response guidelines; exercises and evaluations; personnel training; detection, identification, and warning;
notification; and enemy attack actions. It establishes responsibilities, procedures, and standards for Air
Force mitigation and emergency response to physical threats resulting from major accidents; natural
disasters; conventional attacks (including those using high-yield explosives); and terrorist use of CBRN
materials. This instruction includes domestic and foreign guidance. (Note: HQ Pacific Air Forces
[PACAF] will determine whether domestic or foreign guidance applies to Alaska and Hawaii.) Its pre-
scribed planning process helps commanders achieve unity of effort, allocate and use resources effectively,
and identify shortfalls in their response capabilities. See Attachment 1 for definitions of acronyms,
abbreviations, and terms used in this instruction. Consult cited policy directives, instructions, manuals,
and their supplements for specific policies, procedures, and requirements. Send recommended changes
and major command (MAJCOM) supplements to this publication to HQ AFCESA/CEXR, 139 Barnes

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This interim change (IC) updates and changes training requirements for the Chemical, Biological, Radio-
logical, Nuclear, and High-yield Explosive (CBRNE) Defense Training Course and Explosive Ordnance
Reconnaissance (EOR) Training Course to AFI 10-2501. It also updates the name of the CE Readiness
Flight to Readiness and Emergency Management Flight IAW Program Action Directive (PAD) 07-02.
Unless specifically stated within this IC, all changes for implementation of the new online CBRNE
Defense Course are effective 30 September 2007 for active duty units and 31 October 2007 for ANG and
AFRC units. This allows Readiness and Emergency Management Flights to inform the base populace of
the new changes. A margin bar ( | ) indicates newly revised material.
Program Action Directive (PAD) 07-02 changes the name of the CE Readiness Flight to Readiness and
Emergency Management Flight. This PAD is located on the AF Portal under the Emergency Management
section. The flight is mentioned in over 30 locations in AFI 10-2501, changes to this will not be made
until the next revision.
(AFMC) This interim change updates installation exercising requirements, AFMC Corporate Readiness
Structure alignment and membership, and AFMC EM Analysis ratings guidance. A margin bar ( | ) indi-
cates newly revised material.

                 AIR FORCE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (EM) PROGRAM

1.1. General Information. This instruction implements Air Force Doctrine Document (AFDD) 2-1.8,
Counter Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Operations; Air Force Policy Document (AFPD) 10-2,
Readiness; AFPD 10-25, Full-Spectrum Threat Response (to be renamed Emergency Management);
AFPD 10-26, Counter-Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Operational Preparedness (to be renamed
Counter-Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Operations); AFPD 10-8, Homeland Security;
and portions of AFDD 2-4.1, Force Protection. It also aligns the Air Force with Homeland Security Pres-
idential Directive 5 (HSPD-5), the National Incident Management System (NIMS), and the National
Response Plan (NRP). This instruction also implements the Air Force Incident Management System
(AFIMS) based on the NIMS methodology and aligns Air Force EM planning and response with the NRP
as directed by HSPD-5. The AFIMS provides scalable and flexible response to organize field-level oper-
ations for a broad spectrum of emergencies. The EM program addresses the impacts of major accidents,
natural disasters, conventional attacks, and terrorist attacks. Commanders can achieve unity of effort, use
resources effectively, and identify shortfalls using the AFIMS planning process and this instruction.
AFIMS is defined in Attachment 1.

1.2. Purpose. This instruction provides the staff and key agencies of higher headquarters, installations,
and unit commanders with the policies, guidance, structure, and roles and responsibilities to prepare for,
prevent, respond to, recover from, and mitigate threats to their mission. This instruction also includes
guidance to plan, conduct, and evaluate Air Force EM exercises.
NOTE: For differentiation purposes, the terms "CBRN" and "CBRNE" are defined below and in Attach-
ment 1.
CBRN. Operations that include chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear materials, either individu-
ally or in combination. Collectively known as weapons of mass destruction (WMD), CBRN replaces
"Nuclear, biological, or chemical (NBC)" when used in reference to operations or incidents limited to
WMD issues. Toxic Industrial Chemicals or Toxic Industrial Materials (TIC/TIM) and Hazardous Materi-
als (HAZMAT) are considered part of the "C" in "CBRN".
CBRNE. Operations or incidents involving chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield
explosives, or materials, either individually or in combination. "CBRNE" is used whenever reference is
not being made to "NBC-only" operations or incidents.

1.3. Mission. The primary missions of the Air Force EM program are to save lives; minimize the loss or
degradation of resources; and continue, sustain, and restore operational capability in an all-hazards phys-
ical threat environment at Air Force installations worldwide. The ancillary missions of the Air Force EM
program are to support homeland defense and civil support operations and to provide support to civil and
host nation authorities IAW DOD directives and through the appropriate Combatant Command
(COCOM). The Air Force EM program addresses the physical threats listed in paragraph 1.1., occurring
either individually or in combination. AFIMS phases of incident management include prevention, prepa-
ration, response, recovery, and mitigation. The Air Force EM program examines potential emergencies
and disasters based on the risks posed by likely hazards; develops and implements programs aimed
toward reducing the impact of these events on the installation; prepares for risks that cannot be elimi-
AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008                                                 11


nated; and prescribes actions required to deal with consequences of actual events and to recover from
those events.

1.4. Program Policy. The Air Force will establish a single integrated EM program to mitigate the effects
of major accidents; natural disasters; conventional attacks (including those using high-yield explosives);
and terrorist use of CBRN materials on Air Force personnel, resources, and operations. The Air Force EM
program will develop and implement measures for, and manage activities related to, emergency prepared-
ness, incident management, passive defense (including response and recovery operations) and conse-
quence management. The Air Force Civil Engineer (AF/A7C) is the office of primary responsibility
(OPR) for the Air Force EM program. Chapter 3 lists responsibilities of organizations that manage other
program elements. The Air Force EM program is established IAW this instruction.
   1.4.1. When compliance with this publication is impractical due to unique local or MAJCOM situa-
   tions, request a waiver from AF/A7CX. An approved waiver remains in effect until the approving
   official cancels it in writing or this instruction is revised. When the OPR revises this publication, the
   waiver requester must renew the waiver. Until a waiver is approved by AF/A7CX, the MAJCOM or
   installation must make every effort to comply with this publication. The instruction OPR must main-
   tain a copy of all waiver requests with the instruction record set.
   1.4.1. (AFMC) Requests for waivers and exclusions to this instruction will be submitted to HQ
   AFMC/A7OX for review, coordination, approval, and forwarding. Unless specifically waived, AFMC
   installations and units are required to adhere to the requirements in this supplement.
   1.4.2. MAJCOM and other agency supplements to this publication should be forwarded to HQ AFC-
   ESA/CEXR. Supplements cannot be less restrictive than the basic publication; however, if needed,
   they can be more restrictive. Waivers to supplemental guidance will be handled by the agency that
   developed the supplement.
   1.4.2. (AFMC) HQ AFMC/A7OX is the OPR for developing MAJCOM guidance to this instruction.

1.5. Major Program Elements. Major program elements of the Air Force EM program include warning
and reporting, command and control (C2), planning, equipping, organizing, training, exercising, evaluat-
ing, response operations and incident management.

1.6. Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Support.
   1.6.1. Each Air Force unit must participate in the Air Force’s EM program and meet the Air Force’s
   EM program requirements in this and other governing instructions. The host Air Force installation
   will provide support to all assigned, attached, and tenant units, including Air Force Reserve Command
   (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG) units, located on and off the installation. AFRC and ANG
   tenant units will be incorporated into the host installation’s Comprehensive Emergency Management
   Plan (CEMP) 10-2. The Readiness and Emergency Management Flight on the host installation is the
   Installation Commander’s Air Force EM program OPR and is the Installation Office of Emergency
   Management. As such, the intention of this AFI is that the Readiness and Emergency Management
   Flight under the Base Civil Engineer is the only Emergency Management Flight on an installation.
   The EM program must address the objectives and program elements related to all-hazard threats. Con-
   tract and civilian Readiness and Emergency Management Flights are waived from implementing the
   tasks in Table A3.3. until 31 July 2008. Contracted Readiness and Emergency Management Flights
   will need to amend their contracts to incorporate all the tasks in Table A3.3. by 30 August 2008.
12                   AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008


     Readiness and Emergency Management Flights with civilian bargaining unit employees that are
     required to change workplace requirements and assume emergency response roles require bargaining.
     Bargained requirements will then be formalized by designating manpower positions with “emergency
     responder” codes and updated job descriptions.
     1.6.1. (AFMC) The Plans and Readiness Office, 311 MSG/XPR, is the EM program OPR at Brooks
     City-Base Texas.
     1.6.2. MAJCOMs will determine the host installation for each Geographically Separated Unit (GSU)
     and provide guidance to train and equip its units in compliance with the EM program. Guidance may
     include supplementing this instruction and will include conducting Staff Assistance Visits (SAV). Air
     Force units located on other services’ installations will integrate into the host service’s EM program or
     equivalent.
     1.6.2. (AFMC) Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Geographically-Separated Unit (GSU) Com-
     manders will appoint and train representatives to oversee the local EM program. Designated host and

     1.6.3. Military resources may be used to help local authorities when necessary to save lives, prevent
     human suffering, or mitigate great property damage. See AFI 10-802, Military Support to Civil
     Authorities.
     1.6.4. Commanders at foreign locations will follow Department of State (DOS), theater, and MAJ-
     COM guidance when assisting local authorities. Commanders at United States territories and US pos-
     sessions will follow Department of the Interior (DOI), theater, and MAJCOM guidance when
     assisting local authorities. MAJCOMs will coordinate with the DOI to determine appropriate response
     protocols at US territory and US possession locations. These response protocols will be published in

   supplements to this instruction. (Note: HQ Pacific Air Forces [PACAF] will determine which guid-
   ance applies to Alaska and Hawaii.)
   1.6.5. The Air Force, under DOD direction, supports the EM programs of Federal agencies, as speci-
   fied in the NRP and interagency agreements.
   1.6.6. Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Compliance with the NIMS. The Air Force
   revised the Full Spectrum Threat Response (FSTR) organizational construct and nomenclature as the
   Air Force EM program to be consistent with the NIMS and the NRP without compromising Air Force
   operational missions or disrupting military command authority. The Air Force uses the same structure
   for peace or war, at domestic and foreign locations. (See note in paragraph 1.6.4.) To implement this
   change, standard NIMS terminology has replaced Air Force-specific terms. See Table 1.1., List of
   Cross-Referenced Terms.

1.7. Relationship to the National Response Plan (NRP) and National Incident Management System
(NIMS). On February 28, 2003, the President issued HSPD-5, which directs the Secretary of Homeland
Security to develop and administer the NIMS. This system provides a consistent, nationwide approach for
Federal, State, and local governments to work effectively and efficiently together to prepare for, prevent,
respond to, recover from, and mitigate domestic incidents, regardless of cause, size, or complexity.
     1.7.1. The NIMS uses a systems approach to integrate the best existing processes and methods into a
     unified national framework for incident management. This framework forms the basis for interopera-
     bility and compatibility that will subsequently enable a diverse set of public and private organizations
     to conduct well-integrated and effective incident management operations. The NIMS provides
     interoperability and compatibility among various preparedness agencies through a core set of con-
     cepts, principles, terminology, and technologies. This core set includes:
        1.7.1.1. The Incident Command System (ICS).
        1.7.1.2. Multiagency Coordination System (MCS).
        1.7.1.3. Unified commands, as defined by the NRP and the NIMS rather than as defined by DOD.
        1.7.1.4. Training, qualifications, and certification.
        1.7.1.5. Resource identification and management, including systems for classifying types of
        resources.
AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008                                              15


     1.7.1.6. Incident information collecting, tracking, and reporting.
     1.7.1.7. Incident resources collecting, tracking, and reporting.
  1.7.2. The Air Force uses the NRP structure to implement the AFIMS. The NRP was developed to
  establish a comprehensive, national, all-hazards approach to incident management across a spectrum
  of activities. The NRP outlines how the Federal government implements the Robert T. Stafford Disas-
  ter Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended, (usually referred to as the Stafford Act) to
  assist State, local, and tribal governments when a major disaster or emergency overwhelms their abil-
  ity to save lives; protect public health, safety, and property and restore their communities. The NRP
  and its resultant organizational structure are used by the Air Force to integrate its incident response
  with civilian responses. In addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) developed
  the NIMS Implementation Template for use by Federal departments and agencies to help them incor-
  porate the NIMS into their emergency response plans, procedures, and policies. The template is avail-
  able on the FEMA web site.
  1.7.3. The NRP requires an ICS designed to enable effective and efficient domestic incident manage-
  ment by integrating a combination of facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures, and communica-
  tions operating within a common organizational structure. ICS is used at all levels of government—
  Federal, State, local, and tribal—as well as by many private-sector organizations.
     1.7.3.1. The ICS is one of two methods used to provide a common operating picture (COP). The
     ICS provides the communications, intelligence sharing and information sharing for incident man-
     agement. The COP provides the framework necessary to:
         1.7.3.1.1. Formulate and disseminate indications and warnings.
         1.7.3.1.2. Formulate, execute, and communicate operational decisions at an incident site, as
         well as between incident management entities across jurisdictions and functional agencies.
         1.7.3.1.3. Prepare for potential requirements and request support for incident management
         activities.
         1.7.3.1.4. Develop and maintain overall awareness and understanding of an incident within
         and across jurisdictions.
     1.7.3.2. Information management is the second of the two methods used to provide a COP. In
     addition, the Air Force GeoBase Program provides situational awareness, supports C2, provides
     the capability to develop plumes and cordons, places information on a map that can be displayed
     and provides a tool kit that supports emergency response.

          AIR FORCE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (EM) PROGRAM STRUCTURE

2.1. Purpose. This chapter discusses the organization of the Air Force EM program at all levels of com-
mand. The Air Force EM program structure establishes a clear progression of coordination and communi-
cation from installation level to MAJCOM level to Air Force level. See Figure 2.1., Air Force Emergency
Management Program. This structure has the following two elements at each command level:
     2.1.1. A strategic planning and management staff to maintain an EM program.
     2.1.2. A tactical response structure to manage or conduct contingency response operations.

Figure 2.1. Air Force Emergency Management Program.

2.2. Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Structure. The Air Force EM program struc-
ture includes a strategic planning and management staff and a tactical response element.
   2.2.1. At Air Force (AF) level, the EM planning and management structure is supported by and sup-
   ports the Air Force Civil Engineer (AF/A7C), the AF Counter-CBRN (C-CBRN) Council; the AF
   C-CBRN Policy Working Group (PWG); the AF C-CBRN Education, Training, Exercise (ETE)
   Working Group; the AF Force Protection Steering Group (FPSG); and the AF Force Protection Work-
   ing Group (FPWG). See Figure 2.2., Air Force Emergency Management Program Structural Rela-
   tionships – Air Force Level. The HQ Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency (HQ AFCESA/CEX)
   provides primary support to AF/A7C for the Air Force EM program.

Figure 2.2. Air Force Emergency Management Program Structural Relationships – Air Force
Level




      2.2.1.1. The AF C-CBRN Council is chartered by the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force and
      chaired by the Director of Strategic Security (AF/A3S). The Council meets quarterly or as directed
      by the Chair to address Air Force-wide issues to counter CBRN threats. The C-CBRN Council:
          2.2.1.1.1. Oversees Air Force C-CBRN policy and guidance measures to organize, train, and
          equip forces IAW the National Security Strategy, National Strategy to Combat WMD, Qua-
          drennial Defense Review, Strategic Planning Guidance, and other policy documents.
          2.2.1.1.2. Addresses Air Force actions to counter CBRN threats through proliferation preven-
          tion, counterforce, active defense, passive defense, and consequence management.
          2.2.1.1.3. Oversees Air Force CBRN issues to maximize warfighting capabilities and support
          lead Federal agencies.
          2.2.1.1.4. Responds to C-CBRN issues presented by its members.
          2.2.1.1.5. Coordinates with the Force Protection Steering Group to prevent duplication of
          effort.
      2.2.1.2. The AF C-CBRN PWG is chartered and directed by the AF C-CBRN Council to carry out
      Council taskings, monitor cross-functional Air Force C-CBRN policy initiatives, and report its
18                   AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008


        activities at Council meetings. The PWG may establish study teams and assign research and anal-
        ysis actions. The AF Deputy Director for Counterproliferation (AF/A3SC) chairs the C-CBRN
        PWG. The C-CBRN PWG coordinates with the Force Protection Working Group (FPWG) to pre-
        vent duplication of effort.
        2.2.1.3. The AF C-CBRN ETE WG is chartered and directed by the AF C-CBRN Council to pro-
        vide individuals with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to enable operations in a CBRN environ-
        ment. The AF C-CBRN ETE WG may establish study teams relevant to education, training, and
        exercise responsibilities. The AF/A3SC chairs the AF C-CBRN ETE WG with HQ AETC as
        co-chair.
     2.2.2. In support of Air Force operations and as the Air Force lead for Agile Combat Support (ACS),
     the Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics, Installations, and Mission Support (AF/A4/7) provides policy
     direction and oversight of the Air Force disaster response force (DRF) capabilities for response,
     recovery, and sustainment of operations. When directed, the Air Staff will assist installations through
     the Air Force Operations Center (AFOC) to provide guidance and supplemental resources for any
     incident involving Air Force resources. The AFOC is the Air Force 24-hour point of contact for EM
     and Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) operations. See AFI 10-206, Operational Report-
     ing, for AFOC and MAJCOM Operations Centers contact information.

2.3. Major Command (MAJCOM) Emergency Management (EM) Program Structure.
     2.3.1. The Air Force EM planning and management structure at MAJCOM headquarters is supported
     by and supports the MAJCOM CE, the Force Protection Executive Council (FPEC), FPWG, the
     Emergency Management Working Group (EMWG), the C-CBRNE Working Group (WG), and head-
     quarters staff such as CE Readiness, Fire Emergency Services (FES), Explosive Ordnance Disposal
     (EOD), Medical (SG), and Security Forces (SF). See Figure 2.3., Air Force Emergency Management
     Program Structural Relationships – MAJCOM Level. MAJCOMs may deviate from the specified
     structure based upon their missions and command structure.
     2.3.1. (AFMC) AFMC Headquarters Corporate Readiness Structure (CRS) is a multi-tiered structure
     with input and support from AFMC Headquarters Directorates and installations. The CRS brings all
     essential participants together in a unified structure for integration, coordination and decision-making
     guidance on AF and AFMC readiness, contingency, and EM issues. See Attachment 8 (Added),
     AFMC Headquarters and Installation CRS, for specific AFMC Headquarters CRS guidance and struc-
     ture.
        2.3.1.1. The MAJCOM C-CBRNE WG (also called CPWG) is a collaborative, cross-functional
        group that provides advice and consultation to the MAJCOM leadership on Air Force C-CBRNE
        operations-related issues. The MAJCOM C-CBRNE WG is chaired by the MAJCOM/A3 or A5 at
        the discretion of the MAJCOM/CV (or can be chaired by the CV directly). The C-CBRNE WG
        coordinates with the FPEC to prevent duplication of effort.
        2.3.1.2. The MAJCOM FPEC (not shown in Figure 2.3.) is an executive-level group with MAJ-
        COM-level responsibilities similar to those of the AF FPSG. See AFI 10-245.
AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008                                         19


Figure 2.3. Air Force Emergency Management Program Structural Relationships – Major Com-
mand Level




NOTE: This diagram shows the relationship between specific working groups, rather than all working
groups at a MAJCOM.
      2.3.1.3. The MAJCOM EMWG addresses MAJCOM-wide cross-functional issues that affect the
      readiness and FP status and capabilities of the MAJCOM and addresses peacetime major acci-
      dents and natural disasters. The MAJCOM/A7C chairs the MAJCOM EMWG. The EMWG meets
      at least semiannually. The EMWG reviews AFIMS and EM training issues; monitors installation’s
      EM operational plans and exercises; reviews readiness issues IAW AFPDs 10-2 and 10-4; reviews
      SAV, exercise and IG trends; monitors AFIMS and CBRNE defense equipment shortfalls; coordi-
      nates new AFIMS tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) and initiatives; and reviews CBRNE
      defense training. MAJCOM EMWG representatives should be the subject matter action officers.
      Issues that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM level will be raised to the AF/A7C. Typical mini-
      mum MAJCOM EMWG membership includes:


                  Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI)
                  A7 Readiness                            Logistics
                  Communications                          Operations
                  Contracting                             Personnel
                  Explosive Ordnance Disposal             Plans and Programs
                  Fire Emergency Services                 Public Affairs
                  History                                 Safety
                  Inspector General                       Security Forces
                  Intelligence                            Services
                  Judge Advocate                          Surgeon General

      2.3.1.4. The MAJCOM FPWG is required IAW AFI 10-245 to support the FPEC on FP enterprise
      management. The FPWG works FP issues assigned by the FPEC or proposed and agreed upon by
20                   AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008


        the members. Members develop courses of action and recommend changes in policy and guidance
        for programs and activities effecting FP. The MAJCOM FPWG coordinates efforts with the MAJ-
        COM EMWG to prevent duplication of effort. The MAJCOM/A7S chairs the MAJCOM FPWG.
        The MAJCOM FPWG is an action officer group that meets to work FP issues.
        2.3.1.5. The MAJCOM Threat Working Group (TWG) provides situation-driven threat assess-
        ments. The fluid nature of the threat requires that the MAJCOM TWG have direct access to the
        MAJCOM commander. The MAJCOM TWG also advises the MAJCOM FPWG and the MAJ-
        COM EMWG as needed.
     2.3.2. At MAJCOM level, the response elements includes the MAJCOM Command Center, Installa-
     tion Control Center (ICC), EOC, and specialized teams such as the MAJCOM Response Task Forces
     (RTF). MAJCOMs activate their Commander’s Senior Staff when requested by Air Staff or the MAJ-
     COM commander. The MAJCOM Commander’s Senior Staff assists the Air Staff or installations in
     response efforts.
     2.3.2. (AFMC) HQ AFMC emergency response element includes the AFMC Commander’s Senior
     Staff (also known as the Battle Staff) and the Emergency Operations Center (EOC). The EOC consists
     of the Crisis Action Team (CAT) and the Command Center. When the EOC is activated, the CAT
     Director assumes duties as EOC Director. The EOC Director, with advice of the Commander's Senior
     Staff, will determine additional requirements to support response taskings during emergencies.
     Depending on the situation, an emergency response function can be activated independently (e.g. the
     CAT can be activated when the Commander’s Senior Staff is not).

2.4. Installation Emergency Management (EM) Program Structure.
     2.4.1. The installation planning and management structure is supported by or supports the installation
     Civil Engineer, the FPEC, EMWG, FPWG, TWG, the CE Readiness Flight, EM aspects of the instal-
     lation exercise evaluation program and unit EM Representatives. See Figure 2.4., Air Force Emer-
     gency Management Program Structural Relationships – Installation Level.
     2.4.1. (AFMC) Installation CRS is a multi-tiered structure with input and support from major host
     and tenant units and functional areas on the installation. The CRS brings all essential participants
     together in a unified structure for integration, coordination and decision-making guidance on AF,
     AFMC, and installation readiness, contingency, and EM issues. See Attachment 8 (Added) for spe-
     cific Installation CRS guidance and structure.

Figure 2.4. Air Force Emergency Management Program Structural Relationships – Installation
Level




NOTE: This diagram shows the relationship between specific working groups, rather than all working
groups on an installation.
      2.4.1.1. The Installation Force Protection Executive Committee (FPEC) (not shown in Figure
      2.4.) is chaired by the Installation Commander. The FPEC receives advice and support from the
      EMWG and the FPWG. See Figure 2.4., Air Force EM Program Structural Relationships – Instal-
      lation Level. MAJCOMs may direct specific deviations based upon the installation’s mission and
      command structure.
      2.4.1.2. The Installation EMWG is chaired by the Mission Support Group (MSG) Commander.
      The chairperson appoints members and establishes working subgroups. Representatives from
      civilian agencies may be invited to discuss functional issues. The EMWG coordinates with the
      EET to review EM program training status; schedule and design EM exercises; monitor CEMP
      10-2 updates; monitor mutual aid agreement (MAA) updates; review SAV and exercise trends;
      monitor AFIMs and CBRNE defense equipment shortfalls; coordinate new AFIMS TTP and initi-
      atives; review the installation augmentation program IAW AFPAM 10-243, Augmentation Duty;
      and facilitate computer-based training equipment for the base populace. The EMWG coordinates
      with the FPWG to prevent duplication of effort. The EMWG will determine which specialized
      teams are required to support the installation EM program and what each team’s composition will
      be. The EMWG also reviews installation-wide programs for the ability to achieve EM program
      objectives. The EMWG meets semiannually unless the chairperson requires meetings more fre-
      quently. Typical minimum Installation EMWG members include:


             Air Force Office of Special Investigations
             Air Reserve Component tenants            Logistics Readiness Squadron
             Air Traffic Control                      Medical representatives
             Aircrew Life Support                     Personnel Readiness Function
             CE Readiness                             Public Affairs
             Communications                           Public Health Emergency Officer
22                  AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008


               Contracting                                Safety
               Explosive Ordnance Disposal                Services
               Fire Emergency Services                    Security Forces
               Installation Deployment Officer            Wing Inspector General
               Installation Exercise Office               Wing Plans and Programs
               representative
               Judge Advocate                             Wing Operations
        2.4.1.3. The Installation FPWG is the commander’s cross-functional working group formed IAW
        AFI 10-245 and made up of wing and tenant units. Working group members coordinate and pro-
        vide deliberate planning for AT and FP issues.
        2.4.1.4. The Installation TWG is required IAW AFI 10-245 as an antiterrorism and force protec-
        tion advisory body for the commander. Key functions include analyzing threats and providing rec-
        ommendations to commanders concerning potential FPCON changes, AT and other measures
        based upon potential threats to facilities or personnel.
     2.4.2. At installation level, the DRF is the structure for response. The DRF includes the ICC, Com-
     mander’s Senior Staff, Emergency Communications Center (ECC), EOC, Incident Commander, First
     Responders (see paragraph 2.4.2.6.), Emergency Responders (see paragraph 2.4.2.7.), Unit Control
     Centers (UCC), ESFs, and specialized teams. These terms are defined in Attachment 1.
     2.4.2. (AFMC) Brooks City-Base and AFRL GSUs are not required to establish and maintain a fully
     robust site DRF. Review interagency agreements, memorandum of agreements, mutual aid agree-
     ments, and taskings in host and supporting installation CEMP 10-2 to determine what DRF require-
     ments are needed. See Table 1.2. (Added), AFRL GSU Host and Supporting Readiness and EM
     Flights, to plan and coordinate DRF requirements.
        2.4.2.1. The ICC directs strategic actions supporting the installation's mission. The command post
        is part of the ICC, which functions as the essential C2 node. The ICC provides a communication
        link with higher headquarters and with civilian agencies. As the focal point for installation-wide
        warning and notification and operation, the ICC communicates directions and information and
        also recommends courses of action concerning the incident. The ICC controls the Commander’s
        Senior Staff, EOC, and UCCs. The Installation Commander serves as the senior leader of the ICC.
        2.4.2.2. The Commander’s Senior Staff is a limited staff formed when the crisis resolution does
        not require formation of the entire ICC. It is activated for a specific incident to command, control,
        and coordinate the required support. The size and composition of the Commander’s Senior Staff is
        scalable to support the Installation Commander’s requirements. It usually requires a team chief
        and functional experts to respond to a specific situation. See Attachment 1 for a more complete
        definition.
        2.4.2.2. (WRIGHTPATTERSON) When appointed, the consolidated Commander Senior Staff
        (CSS) will consist of the following Representatives (See Table 2.1. (Added)). Members will be
        appointed in writing using the Quarterly Unit EM Report.
AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008                                               23

      2.4.2.3. The ECC includes a central dispatch capability or its interim equivalent for the installa-
      tion. It should include the minimum functions of Fire Alarm Communications Center (FACC), SF
      Desk, and Medical dispatch (when applicable). The ECC may be virtual until a central facility can
      be established. The central dispatch capability is a goal that installations must work towards while
      using current assets. The interim virtually-consolidated configurations are considered to be in
      compliance with this guidance until the central dispatch capability can be achieved. Existing
      resources should be used as backup capabilities once physical consolidation occurs.
      2.4.2.4. The EOC is the C2 support elements that directs, monitors, and supports the installation’s
      actions before, during, and after an incident. The EOC is activated and recalled as necessary by the
      Installation Commander. The EOC updates the ICC with ongoing incident status and seeks sup-
      port through the ICC when on-scene requirements surpass the installation’s inherent capability
      and the installation’s cumulative capabilities acquired through MAAs. EOCs may also support
      MCS and joint information activities. See Figure 2.5., On-Base and Off-Base Emergency Man-
      agement Comparison. Core functions of the EOC must include the following:
           2.4.2.4.1. Coordination.
           2.4.2.4.2. Communications, including exchanging data with the Mobile Emergency Opera-
           tions Center (MEOC).
           2.4.2.4.3. Resource dispatch and tracking.
           2.4.2.4.4. Information collection, analysis, and dissemination.

Figure 2.5. On-Base and Off-Base Emergency Management Comparison.




NOTE: The Secretary of State coordinates international activities related to the prevention, preparation,
response, recovery, and mitigation for domestic incidents and to protect United States citizens and United
States interests overseas.
       2.4.2.5. The Incident Commander (IC) is a trained and experienced responder who provides
       on-scene tactical control using subject matter experts (SME) and support from other functionals.
       Normally, ICs are SMEs from the Fire, Medical, or SF response elements. The IC will use the
       AFIMS to manage the incident.
           2.4.2.5.1. Depending upon the situation, other personnel may function as ICs if they have
           completed Incident Command System (ICS) training IAW Chapter 6 and meet DOD and Fed-
           eral certification standards for the specific type of incident. For example, the IC must meet
           Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 6055.6, DOD Fire and Emergency Services Pro-
           gram and Department of Defense Manual (DODM) 6055.6, DOD Fire and Emergency Ser-
           vices Certification Program, requirements for HAZMAT and suspected CBRNE responses.
           FES personnel serve as IC for EOD incidents during peacetime and terrorist response inci-
           dents after SF have contained or neutralized any hostile forces.
           2.4.2.5.2. Federal certification standards for ICs do not currently exist for some incidents such
           as biological disease outbreaks. When no certification standard exists, the Installation Com-
           mander may appoint the appropriate SME as IC. For example, the Public Health Emergency
           Officer (PHEO) could be the IC for a biological incident. As the NIMS Integration Center
AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008                                             25


       develops qualification and certification standards, guidelines, and protocols, the Air Force will
       adopt them and ensure SMEs are adequately trained.
    2.4.2.6. First Responders, as defined by AFIMS, are members of the DRF elements that deploys
    immediately to the disaster scene to provide initial C2, to save lives, and to suppress and control
    hazards. Firefighters, law enforcement and security personnel, key emergency medical personnel
    provide the initial, immediate response to major accidents, natural disasters, and CBRNE inci-
    dents. All First Responders are Emergency Responders, but not all Emergency Responders are
    First Responders. First Responder duties have priority over other assigned duties.
    2.4.2.7. Emergency Responders, as defined by AFIMS, are members of the DRF response ele-
    ments that deploy after the First Responders to expand C2 and provide additional support. Emer-
    gency Responders include follow-on firefighters, law enforcement personnel, security personnel,
    and emergency medical technicians, as well as EM and operations personnel, EOD personnel,
    physicians, nurses, medical treatment providers at medical treatment facilities, CE Readiness per-
    sonnel, public health officers, bioenvironmental engineering, mortuary affairs personnel, and
    other specialized team members. Emergency Responder duties have priority over other assigned
    duties. Emergency Responders are not assigned as augmentees or to additional duties that will
    conflict with their emergency duties.
    2.4.2.8. The Emergency Support Functions (ESF) capabilities are grouped into an organizational
    structure that provides support, resources, program implementation, and services that are most
    likely to be needed during an incident. Installation ESFs serve as the primary operational-level
    mechanism. Personnel assigned to direct ESFs must be highly knowledgeable with decision-mak-
    ing authority for their function. See Attachment 2, Emergency Support Functions for more infor-
    mation. The ESF Annexes of the NRP provide additional discussion on roles and responsibilities
    of ESF coordinators, primary agencies, and support agencies.
    2.4.2.9. The EOC Director is the MSG Commander or other senior representative designated by
    the Installation Commander. The EOC Director provides oversight for the Installation Com-
    mander to support and control emergency response to incidents. The EOC Director can support
    multiple ICs simultaneously, while providing senior officer level C2 for sustained response and
    recovery operations. If senior military authority or assessment is required on scene, the EOC
    Director or designate can move from the EOC to the incident site. Before leaving the EOC, the
    EOC Director must appoint and brief a replacement. The replacement must meet the same training
    requirements as the EOC Director (see Chapter 6). On scene, the Incident Commander maintains
    legal authority and tactical control, including establishing a National Defense Area (NDA) with
    the advice of the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA). The EOC Director serves as the senior military rep-
    resentative to maintain military command authority over military resources as required by law.
    2.4.2.10. UCCs provide mission support to the Incident Commander as directed by the EOC and
    to the Installation Commander as directed by the ICC. The EOC and ICC resolve any conflicting
    requirements. UCCs provide a focal point within an organization to maintain unit C2, relay infor-
    mation to and from unit personnel, provide expertise to the EOC or Incident Commander, and
    leverage unit resources to respond to and mitigate the incident. Unit Commanders will consider
    assigning highly knowledgeable personnel to the EOC and the UCC to facilitate mission accom-

     3.11.12. (WRIGHTPATTERSON) Unit EM Representatives will use the Quarterly Unit EM Report
     to annotate dissemination and documentation date of quarterly Unit EM information.
     3.11.13. Identify requirements, budget for, obtain, store and maintain unit passive defense operational
     and training equipment, including IPE, PPE, detection equipment, contamination control materials
     and shelter supplies for designated installation shelters. For shelter-in-place operations, installations
     must identify procedures for each facility to turn off their heating, ventilation and air-conditioning
     systems. Shelter in-place actions can provide short-term (one-to-two hours) protection to the occu-
     pants and are most effective when building occupants plan and practice their actions in advance. Most
     are simple, low or no-cost actions performed by the occupants or facility manager.
     3.11.14. Identify and equip augmentees to support the EM program. See AFPAM 10-243, Augmenta-
     tion Duty.
     3.11.15. Ensure interoperable communications and visual information services are available for inci-
     dent response.
     3.11.16. Ensure pre-positioned material is stored and maintained for additive forces IAW theater,
     installation and joint support plans.
     3.11.17. In conjunction with the Installation Commander, prepare for and determine options for all
     personnel to obtain access to computers to accomplish computer-based training.
     3.11.18. Ensure that ICC, EOC, ECC and UCC members participate in at least one exercise per year.
     Document training IAW Chapter 6.
     3.11.19. Ensure personnel who are inherently deployable to CBRNE defense threat areas can perform
     mission-essential tasks in a contaminated environment. Do not levy this requirement against person-
     nel who are specifically exempted. Inherently deployable (in) and specifically exempted (out) are
     defined in AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution.
     3.11.20. Ensure that all unit military personnel and emergency-essential civilians and contractors
     maintain and use AFMAN 10-100, Airman’s Manual, during exercises and real world contingencies.
AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008                                              51


   3.11.21. Ensure that the unit EM Representatives complete semi-annual self-inspections IAW AFI
   32-4001.
   3.11.21. (WRIGHTPATTERSON) Unit EM Representatives will use the Unit EM SAV checklist to
   conduct and document self-inspections semi-annually (Jan/Jul). Once completed forward a copy to 88
   ABW/CECMX for review and coordination. Representatives will document completed semi-annual
   Unit EM Self-Inspections using the Unit EM Quarterly Report.

3.12. Installation and Unit Specialized Teams.
   3.12.1. Specialized teams are formed from the existing installation and unit personnel resources to
   support emergency response operations. Specialized team duty becomes a team member’s primary
   duty during response, exercises and training. Team members should not be assigned conflicting emer-
   gency duties. Enough team members must be appointed for 24-hour-a-day operations.
   3.12.1. (WRIGHTPATTERSON) WPAFB Readiness Support Team (RST) will be designated as
   WPAFB Emergency Management (EM) Augmentees.
       3.12.1.1. Readiness Support Team (RST). The RST is a trained team that augments the CE Readi-
       ness Flight. RST members must not be assigned to other additional duties that conflict with RST
       duties. Commanders and supervisors of RST members must understand that when the RST is
       recalled, RST becomes an RST member’s primary duty.
       3.12.1.1. (AFMC) Excluding Brooks City-Base and AFRL GSUs, an RST is required to accom-
       plish emergency and contingency requirements in the REMF/REMO and to augment the installa-
       tion DRF. During routine operations and training sessions, the RST is managed by the REMF/
       REMO. When recalled for emergencies, the RST is under the authority of the EOC Director. The
       RST is not a labor force to accomplish Readinesss and EM program management and day to day
       functions. RST members can be appointed from host and tenant unit contractor, civilian and mili-
       tary resources.
       3.12.1.1. (WRIGHTPATTERSON) 88 ABW/CE will provide 6 personnel to fill the WPAFB
       EM Augmentee positions.
       3.12.1.2. Shelter Management Team (SMT). The SMT is comprised of two elements, unit person-
       nel assigned and trained to perform management duties and sheltered personnel identified by the
       shelter supervisor to augment trained personnel.
       3.12.1.3. Contamination Control Teams (CCT). These teams are comprised of unit personnel who
       perform contamination control measures specific to the incident. Unit personnel fill all CCT posi-
       tions. Units that must have threat-based CCTs include Transportation, Maintenance, Munitions,
       Medical, and Civil Engineers.
       3.12.1.4. Post Attack Reconnaissance (PAR) Team. PAR teams are organized, trained and
       equipped by the unit. The minimum size for a PAR team is two people so one person can watch for
       hazards, provide security and call for assistance if needed.
   3.12.2. Other teams support the installation’s emergency response depending upon the installation
   mission and threat. Teams that support recovery, either on scene or on the installation, may include
   Search and Recovery, Crash Recovery and IPPD. The IPPD is used at the medical treatment facility to
   decontaminate casualties and responders. These teams are trained and equipped IAW functional guid-
52                  AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008


     ance. Teams are activated through the EOC and their UCC when situations require their specialized
     skills and equipment.

3.13. Installation Functional Support. Installation functional support is listed in Attachment 2
through Attachment 4.
AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008                                                 53


                                               Chapter 4

AIR FORCE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (EM) PROGRAM PLANNING, THREATS AND
                           RESPONSE

4.1. Purpose. This chapter provides an overview of the AFIMS phases of incident management. It dis-
cusses general information concerning the major EM threats, delineates policy for each type of incident
and summarizes the phases of incident management as they apply to that type of incident.

4.2. General. The primary objective of EM program planning is to support Air Force plans by minimiz-
ing effects caused by all-hazards incidents. EM program planning addresses a wide range of threats for the
Air Force. The Air Force EM program implements the AFIMS based on NIMS methodology and includes
the NRP standardized phases of incident management: prevention, preparedness, response, recovery and
mitigation. These phases of incident management are discussed in paragraph 4.5.
   4.2.1. Installations, including tenant units, will tailor their response capability to the installation’s
   mission and threat assessment. Commanders must stress both planning and response to provide unity
   of effort, allocate resources efficiently and identify shortfalls early. Force survivability and mission
   continuation are the highest priorities for planning.
   4.2.1. (AFMC) Brooks City-Base is no longer a robust installation with full organic emergency
   response capability. Brooks City-Base will coordinate tailored emergency response processes with the
   Brooks Development Authority and the City of San Antonio, and outline the processes in their base
   supplement/instruction and CEMP 10-2.
   4.2.2. The planning goals listed below are not in priority order:
       4.2.2.1. Decentralize vital operations and mission-critical resources.
       4.2.2.2. Disperse, shelter, or cover response and recovery resources.
       4.2.2.3. Relocate, evacuate, or shelter all personnel affected or potentially affected by the inci-
       dent.
       4.2.2.4. Provide IPE for FP and PPE for incident response and recovery.
       4.2.2.5. Improve protection for buildings used as shelters.
       4.2.2.6. Develop MAAs with civilian and host nation authorities.
       4.2.2.7. Provide information, notification and warning systems.
       4.2.2.8. Implement CBRNE detection, risk assessment, avoidance, control, plotting, predicting,
       warning and reporting measures.
       4.2.2.9. Provide information flow between C2 elements and the general installation populace.
       4.2.2.10. Provide recovery actions from effects of EM incidents.
       4.2.2.11. Provide survivable, interoperable communications.
       4.2.2.12. Ensure seamless operations with other Federal agencies in response to Catastrophic
       Events or Incidents of National Significance as defined by DODD 3025.15, NIMS and the NRP.
       Ensure plans support other Federal agencies during Incidents of National Significance.

     4.2.3. Planning is based upon a threat assessment that enables commanders to identify minimum stan-
     dards to train, organize, equip and protect forces. The CBRNE threat areas are shown in Table 4.1.,
     Worldwide CBRNE Threat Area Table. This table was based upon the Threat Compendium: World-
     wide Threat to Airbases and developed under the guidance of AF/A7CXR with support from HQ
     AFCESA/CEX, in coordination with MAJCOM Civil Engineers and cannot be changed without AF/
     A7CXR approval. The table is provided to assist with equipment planning and budgeting only. See
     Chapter 6 for training requirements. Installations must evaluate the current operations, intelligence
     reports, and risk assessments to determine the current local threat. CBRNE High, Medium, and Low
     Threat Areas are defined in Attachment 1.

Table 4.1. Worldwide Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosive
(CBRNE) Threat Area Table.
        CBRNE Threat Area                   Geographical Location
     1. High Threat Area (HTA)              Bahrain, Balkans Region, Diego Garcia, Egypt, Greece,
                                            India, Israel, Jordan, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
                                            Pakistan, Qatar, Republic of China (Taiwan), Republic of
                                            Korea, Somalia, Singapore, Sudan, Thailand, Turkey, and
                                            United Arab Emirates
     2. Medium Threat Area (MTA)            Germany, Italy, Japan, and Yemen
     3. Low Threat Area (LTA)               All locations not listed as a high or medium threat area

NOTE: See the Threat Compendium: Worldwide Threat to Airbases for further threat-related informa-
tion.
     4.2.4. The nature of conventional and asymmetrical CBRNE weapons and their delivery systems
     makes positive identification of the type of attack difficult until after the attack has occurred. Com-
     manders should tailor their forces and employ threat-specific countermeasures that mitigate risk to
     resources and personnel necessary to sustain operations. Intelligence and counterintelligence activi-
     ties support EM by assessing enemy order of battle, means of delivery, weapons type, or agent fill and
     the conditions under which hostile forces may employ these weapons.

4.3. Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) 10-2. The installation CEMP 10-2 pro-
vides comprehensive guidance for emergency response to physical threats resulting from major accidents,
natural disasters, conventional attacks, terrorist attack, and CBRN attacks. As such it is intended to be a
separate installation plan and will not be combined with other plans until HQ AF develops and fields a
template and provides implementation guidance. During deployments, commanders may need to use
other plans, such as the Expeditionary Support Plan (ESP) prepared IAW AFI 10-404, Base Support and
Expeditionary Site Planning, to provide EM-specific execution tasks until a CEMP 10-2 is developed. All
installations must develop a CEMP 10-2 to address the physical threats to their base. Sufficient resources
may not be available early in a deployment to implement a comprehensive EM program. The CEMP 10-2
should be coordinated with OPRs of other installation plans such as the AT Plan 31-101, Base Defense
Plan, MCRP, ESP and Installation Deployment Plan. The CEMP 10-2 must be coordinated through all
tasked agencies. Any conflicts with other plans must be resolved before publication. Readiness and Emer-
gency Management Flights will provide an information copy of the CEMP 10-2, unless it is classified, to
local civilian agencies as part of their total coordination effort.
AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008                                               55


4.3. (AFMC) Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) 10-2. Excluding AFRL GSUs,
AFMC installations will forward an electronic copy of the CEMP 10-2 to HQ AFMC/A7OX as part of the
coordination effort.
4.3. (WRIGHTPATTERSON) Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) 10-2. 88 ABW/
CECMX will ensure that a electronic copy of the WPAFB CEMP 10-2 is sent to HQ AFMC/A7OX.
   4.3.1. Each installation unit, including tenants, must use the CEMP 10-2 template to develop
   unit-specific checklists to support the installation CEMP 10-2. Checklists must tell who, what, when,
   where and how actions will be accomplished. Each unit must develop checklists for each specialized
   team they control. Once the checklists are complete, they must be coordinated through the Readiness
   and Emergency Management Flight before implementation.
   4.3.1. (WRIGHTPATTERSON) Unit EM Representatives will forward a copy of checklists to 88
   ABW/CECMX for review and coordination.
       4.3.1.1. (Added-WRIGHTPATTERSON) Unit EM Representatives will use the Quarterly Unit
       EM Report to document the current date of unit functional, UCC, CSS, EOC, and Specialized
       Team checklists.
   4.3.2. MAJCOMs may provide specific EM program requirements for their installations, including
   MAJCOM instructions for program management, exercise and administrative information. Response
   must conform to AFIMS.
   4.3.2. (AFMC) Excluding AFRL GSUs, AFMC installations will supplement this guidance in a base
   supplement or instruction. Host and supporting Readiness and Emergency Management Flights in
   Table 1.2. (Added) will help AFRL GSUs in developing EM program and emergency response guid-
   ance. Forward an electronic copy of the supplemental guidance to HQ AFMC/A7OX as part of the
   coordination effort.
   4.3.2. (WRIGHTPATTERSON) 88 ABW/CECMX Emergency Management Flight will serve as
   OPR for development of the WPAFB 10-2501 supplement and will provide technical guidance and
   assistance to Det 13, Mesa Research Site in the development of their local EM program and emer-
   gency response procedures.
   4.3.3. DRUs, FOAs and NAFs support the EM Program as directed by their MAJCOM. DRUs and
   FOAs that report directly to the Chief of Staff, US Air Force, will maintain a current, executable EM
   plan and supporting checklists.
   4.3.4. GSUs are not required to develop a CEMP 10-2, but they must develop EM operating proce-
   dures and coordinate them with the host CE Readiness Flight. MAJCOMs will supplement this
   instruction with guidance for host installations to identify specific support requirements for off-base
   units in the CEMP 10-2.
   4.3.5. Review documents that address elements of the Air Force EM program when developing the
   CEMP 10-2. Documents to review include intelligence reports, training and equipment standards,
   installation plans, MAAs, ESPs and joint support plans. Integrate the capabilities provided by other
   documents, or cross-reference them to avoid duplication.
   4.3.6. Classify and handle the CEMP 10-2 IAW AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Manage-
   ment. Three options are available for CEMP 10-2 classification:
56                  AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008


        4.3.6.1. The plan should be unclassified to ensure maximum distribution, but designated For Offi-
        cial Use Only.
        4.3.6.2. If portions of the plan are classified, those portions must receive appropriate handling and
        should be distributed separately IAW AFI 31-401.
        4.3.6.3. If the entire plan is classified, follow instructions in AFI 31-401.
     4.3.7. The plan lists key actions commanders and tasked agencies must accomplish based on the
     threat. Annexes should not repeat the main plan. Base the plan on the template located on the Air
     Force Portal. When EM guidance is included in another plan, such as the ESP or WMP-1, reference
     the other plan but do not repeat the guidance. The CEMP 10-2 has five annexes.
        4.3.7.1. Annex A: Major Accidents
        4.3.7.2. Annex B: Natural Disasters
        4.3.7.2. (AFMC) Add AFMC Evacuee Beddown Support Plan as an appendix to Annex B until
        the AF CEMP 10-2 template is updated.
        4.3.7.3. Annex C: Enemy CBRNE Attacks. Unless specifically mandated by MAJCOMs,
        CONUS bases that determine they have a low threat from this kind of action are not required to
        write this annex.
        4.3.7.3. (AFMC) Annex C is not required.
        4.3.7.4. Annex D: Terrorist Use of CBRNE
        4.3.7.5. Annex Z: Distribution
NOTE: Disease containment planning has applicability to multiple annexes. Naturally occurring disease
outbreaks, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or pandemic flu, are considered a natural disaster
and are addressed in Annex B. Biological warfare attack can come from a traditional adversary (Annex C)
or from a terrorist group (Annex D). Because Air Force disease containment planning is biological
attack-focused, it is included in Annex C, CBRNE Attack. Annexes B and D will cross-reference to
Annex C when planning for a naturally occurring disease outbreak or terrorist use of biological weapons.

4.4. Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) 10-2 Functional Checklists. E a c h
installation unit, including tenants, must develop unit-specific checklists supporting the CEMP 10-2
within 30 days of publication. See paragraph 4.3.1.

4.5. Standard Phases of Incident Management. The NIMS and the NRP state that the five phases of
incident management are prevention, preparedness, response, recovery and mitigation. These phases of
incident management have been incorporated into AFIMS and provide the framework with which the
installation DRF responds to all EM events. Comprehensive definitions of these phases are included in
Attachment 1. Actions that were traditionally considered to be pre-event or pre-attack actions are consid-
ered to be prevention, preparedness and mitigation actions under AFIMS. Actions that were traditionally
considered to be trans-event or trans-attack actions are considered to be response or mitigation actions
under AFIMS. Actions that were traditionally considered to be post-event or post-attack actions are con-
sidered to be recovery or mitigation actions under AFIMs. Under AFIMS, the DRF includes the ICC, the
EOC, the ECC, the IC, First Responders and Emergency Responders, UCCs and specialized teams. The
AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008                                                  57


DRF is used to respond to all incidents, although it may be configured differently depending upon the
incident.
   4.5.1. For AFIMS, prevention includes broad categories of activities such as intelligence collection
   and analysis, active defense, proliferation prevention, fire prevention, disease prevention and contam-
   ination prevention. Prevention also includes more specific tasks such as Safety Mishap Investigations
   that contribute information to prevent future mishaps.
   4.5.2. For AFIMS, preparedness includes actions such as planning discussed in Chapter 4, the Air
   Force EM training covered in Chapter 6 and the Air Force EM exercise and evaluation covered in
   Chapter 7. Preparedness also includes specific tasks such as identifying augmentation manpower
   needs or reviewing ESPs.
   4.5.3. For AFIMS, response includes deploying the DRF (see Chapter 4), executing the CEMP 10-2
   (this chapter) and notification and warning (see Chapter 9).
       4.5.3.1. Imminently serious conditions resulting from any civil emergency or attack may require
       immediate action by military commanders to save lives, prevent human suffering, or mitigate
       great property damage.
       4.5.3.2. When such conditions exist and time does not permit prior approval from higher head-
       quarters, local military commanders and responsible officials of other DOD components can
       respond to civil authorities’ requests, with follow-on reporting through the appropriate command
       chain as soon as possible.
   4.5.4. For AFIMS, recovery includes operations such as implementing casualty treatment, unex-
   ploded ordnance (UXO) safing, Contamination Control Area (CCA) processing, airfield damage
   repair and facility restoration. Recovery planning and actions begin as soon as possible to ensure sus-
   tainment of crucial missions and restoration of normal operations.
   4.5.5. For AFIMS, mitigation includes general measures. Mitigation is an ongoing process and is
   considered, to some degree, a part of every phase of incident management. In a global sense, mitiga-
   tion includes all activities designed to reduce or eliminate risks to persons or property or to lessen the
   actual or potential effects or consequences of an incident. See the NRP for a more detailed discussion
   of mitigation during all phases of incident management. See also paragraphs 4.6.6.5., 4.7.4.5., 4.8.4.5.
   and 4.9.4.5. for discussions of how mitigation is applied during each type of incident.

4.6. Major Accidents, Including Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT).
   4.6.1. The Air Force EM program addresses major accident responses through this instruction, while
   the Air Force Safety program addresses mishaps through AFI 91-204. Major accidents are defined in
   paragraph 4.6.2. Mishaps are defined in paragraph 4.6.2.2. The differences between major accidents
   and mishaps are discussed in paragraph 4.6.3.
   4.6.2. A major accident is an accident of such a magnitude as to warrant response by the installation
   DRF. It differs from day-to-day emergencies and incidents that are routinely handled by base agencies
   without the DRF. A major accident may involve one or more of the following:
       4.6.2.1. Hazardous substances, such as radioactive materials, TIC/TIMs, or explosives.
       4.6.2.2. Class A Mishap. A mishap is an unplanned occurrence or series of occurrences that
       results in damage or injury and meets Class A, B, C, or D mishap reporting criteria IAW AFI
58                   AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008


        91-204. Specific examples include damage to DOD property, occupational illness to DOD mili-
        tary or civilian personnel, injury to DOD military personnel on- or off-duty, injury to on-duty
        DOD civilian personnel, damage to public or private property, or injury or illness to non-DOD
        personnel caused by Air Force operations. Class A mishaps may be categorized as major acci-
        dents, depending upon the situation and the need for the DRF.
        4.6.2.3. Extensive property damage.
        4.6.2.4. Grave risk of injury or death to personnel.
        4.6.2.5. Adverse public reaction.
     4.6.3. The relationship between major accidents and mishaps may be misleading because the defini-
     tion of a mishap is broader than the definition of a major accident. A mishap includes all major acci-
     dents, plus some minor accidents, plus occupation illnesses and injuries to individuals. Conversely,
     the scope of an actual major accident may far exceed the scope of an actual mishap. For example, a
     mishap may occur where only one person is injured in an industrial accident, less than $20,000 of
     direct cost is involved, or an injury does not result in any loss of time from work. This mishap would
     not be considered a major accident and would not require a DRF response. Major accidents differ
     from the minor day-to-day emergencies and incidents that installation agencies typically handle. All
     major accidents are considered mishaps, but not all mishaps are considered major accidents.
     4.6.4. Examples of major accidents include nuclear weapon accidents, nuclear reactor facility acci-
     dents, HAZMAT spills, aircraft crashes and fires. Through the CEMP 10-2, the Air Force plans
     response for specific types of major accidents such as HAZMAT incidents or aircraft accidents.
     4.6.5. The DOD must respond to major accidents involving DOD resources or resulting from DOD
     activities. AFI 10-206 and AFI 91-204 provide reporting requirements for mishaps involving Air
     Force equipment or personnel.
        4.6.5.1. The installation must plan, equip and train to provide immediate, decisive incident
        response anytime an incident occurs on the installation. Additionally, the installation may respond
        immediately if the effects of an incident on or off an installation extend to or involve surrounding
        civilian communities or when the need to save lives, prevent human suffering or mitigate great
        property damage is a concern.
        4.6.5.2. The installation may respond immediately when acting under an immediate response
        condition, when acting IAW an existing MAA, or when civil authorities request assistance and
        time does not allow prior approval from higher headquarters. The installation must report any
        assistance provided as soon as possible. The installation should begin tracking all support expen-
        ditures as soon as response begins and continue until response ends. See AFI 10-802.
        4.6.5.3. For accidents involving nuclear weapons or their components, Installation Commanders
        must adhere to AF/PA policy IAW AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policy and Procedures. They must
        provide effective PA activities near the scene of a nuclear weapon accident and speed the flow of
        information to the public and the internal audience. In the United States, its territories, or its pos-
        sessions, DOD policy requires the senior ranking military authority on scene, usually the Incident
        Commander, to confirm the presence of nuclear weapons or radioactive nuclear components in the
        interest of public safety or to reduce or prevent widespread public alarm. Public authorities must
        be notified if the public is, or may be, in danger of radiation exposure or other danger posed by the
        weapon or its components. Statements that confirm the presence of nuclear weapons should
AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008                                               59


     clearly address whether or not the possibility exists for exposure to radiation or injury from high
     explosive (HE) weapon components. Foreign theater commanders who have RTF responsibilities
     provide planning and exercise requirements for their supporting RTFs. Domestic MAJCOMs with
     RTF responsibilities, as discussed in Chapter 3, provide additional response procedures in their
     RTF plans.
     4.6.5.4. The Initial Response Base (IRB) coordinates directly with local officials until FEMA or
     host nation officials arrive. The IRB is the nearest military installation having a disaster response
     capability, regardless of size, to a major accident involving DOD resources. The Air Force IRB
     responds unless directed otherwise by the MAJCOM, theater, or AFOC. Installations must pro-
     vide initial response to incidents involving nuclear weapons and must control the scene until
     relieved by higher authority. For nuclear weapons accidents, the IRB will proceed to the radiolog-
     ical accident or incident scene to render emergency assistance, including maintaining C2 of the
     accident site until relieved by the RTF. Subject to its capabilities, the IRB may be tasked to do the
     following: rescue operations, accident site security, fire fighting, initiation of EOD procedures,
     radiation monitoring, establishing C2 and communications, public affairs activities and casualty
     management.
     4.6.5.5. In accidents involving HAZMAT, the release of public information must comply with the
     specific instructions given in movement and plans or orders and DOD or overseas-unified com-
     mand policies.
     4.6.5.6. Civil authorities oversee off-base response and recovery operations within the United
     States, its territories and possessions. DOS, DOD, COCOM, MAJCOM and SOFA describe civil
     jurisdiction and support for EM in all other areas.
        4.6.5.6.1. Involvement of military resources in an off-base response gives the Air Force no
        specific rights or jurisdiction unless an NDA is established.
        4.6.5.6.2. When directed by higher authority, the Air Force will support civil authorities to the
        maximum extent practical; however, the Air Force’s warfighting mission will take priority
        over support to civilian authorities.
  4.6.6. Major Accident Phases of Incident Management.
     4.6.6.1. Prevention. Major accident prevention includes many actions covered by Air Force pro-
     grams such as the Safety Program IAW AFI 91-204. Although the Air Force EM program empha-
     sizes the other phases of incident management, the prevention phase can save lives and minimize
     the need to use resources to respond and recover from major accidents.
     4.6.6.2. Preparedness. Examples of preparedness for major accidents include maintaining and
     testing the installation notification and warning system, developing and exercising installation
     recall procedures and certifying equipment. Another example of preparedness is publishing, test-
     ing and validating response procedures.
     4.6.6.3. Response. Major Accident Response has three overlapping phases – notification,
     response and withdrawal or evacuation.
        4.6.6.3.1. During notification, installation authorities receive notification of an actual or
        potential accident, C2 initiates response and the installation populace is notified. Typically,
        installations will use the primary and secondary crash nets to notify the Emergency Respond-
60               AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008


        ers. Any necessary evacuation or sheltering begins. The command post alerts and recalls the
        EOC and notifies both higher headquarters and local civil authorities.
        4.6.6.3.2. Response begins when the First Responders deploy. First Responders approach the
        site, preferably from an upwind or crosswind direction, and perform initial lifesaving, rescue,
        suppression, containment and evacuation. During response, the IC arrives on scene to establish
        C2 and directs life saving, rescue, containment and mitigation. Response ends with the com-
        pletion of fire or hazard suppression, emergency rescue, transportation of casualties to medical
        treatment facilities, securing of classified material or components and isolation of hazards.
        4.6.6.3.3. The IC decides whether to evacuate personnel from the hazard area or to shel-
        ter-in-place. Withdrawal occurs when response forces are in imminent danger or all response
        actions have been completed. Withdrawal may be immediate or planned. Evacuate people in
        immediate danger of a downwind hazard. Move victims away from the scene and away from
        responders when evacuating personnel.
     4.6.6.4. Recovery. Recovery operations begin as soon as possible but normally follow hazard mit-
     igation and when all emergency response actions are completed. Hazard mitigation is the cumula-
     tive set of tasks focused on a specific hazard to reduce the risks and effects associated with that
     hazard. In addition, commanders use hazard mitigation to plan, prepare and respond effectively to
     a given hazard. The mitigation phase, in contrast, is a general series of actions that continue
     throughout all AFIMS phases to reduce all-hazards risks and effects. Transfer of command to
     recovery organizations takes place when hazard mitigation is complete. Some emergency
     response elements may remain on scene for safety purposes. The recovery phase restores the area
     and operations to normal conditions. The EOC develops a recovery plan, which is approved by the
     Installation Commander before it is implemented. The recovery plan must address all items in
     CEMP 10-2, Annex A, Recovery Operations Checklist, including mishap investigation require-
     ments.
     4.6.6.5. Mitigation. Mitigation of risks and effects from major accidents takes two primary forms.
     First, methodical planning to prepare and respond effectively to major accidents is accomplished
     by preparing and exercising plans. According to the NIMS, a mitigation plan is considered a sub-
     set of preparedness. The Air Force provides mitigation planning through the CEMP 10-2, the
     Mortuary and Services Search and Recovery Plan and others. Second, the installation mitigates
     the effects of major accidents by performing a careful and current hazards analysis considering the
     population and probable accidents and developing appropriate measures to mitigate the results.
     4.6.6.6. All major accidents require the same basic response actions; however, some types of acci-
     dents require additional issues be considered. Every accident will present unique challenges. For
     example, advanced aerospace materials used in some aircraft can release composite fibers that are
     a known hazard to the respiratory tract, eyes and skin and can cause electrical equipment to arc
     and short. Safety precautions must be observed during emergency response, handling, cleanup and
     disposal. All First Responders must be trained on permanently and temporarily assigned installa-
     tion-specific hazards.
        4.6.6.6.1. Temporary storage of government shipments includes DOE and DOT Safe Haven,
        Safe Parking Shipments and Secure Holding. Safe Haven provides Air Force support of mili-
        tary and military-sponsored shipments. Safe Parking provides temporary storage of DOE ship-
        ments of transuranic waste material. Secure Holding provides secure holding areas for
AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008                                                  61


          commercial carriers transporting Arms, Ammunition and Explosives (AA&E), classified
          materials and Controlled Cryptographic Items (CCI) in the interest of public safety and
          national security.
          4.6.6.6.2. Accidents involving HAZMAT can cause serious problems for Air Force installa-
          tions and the local community. Air Force policy is to comply with the emergency planning and
          notification provisions of the Superfund and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986, Title III,
          Emergency Planning and Community-Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA). Installations must keep
          the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC) and LEPC informed of its emergency
          planning and notification efforts. Actions taken when responding to a HAZMAT emergency
          are identical to those taken for other major accidents; however, specific processes and emer-
          gency notification procedures must be followed during HAZMAT incidents. The core of most
          HAZMAT teams includes the First Responders from FES supplemented by Bioenvironmental,
          CE Readiness and EOD.

4.7. Natural Disasters.
   4.7.1. Natural disasters can create emergency conditions that vary widely in scope, urgency and
   degree of damage and destruction. Plan for worst-case scenarios for those natural disasters that could
   occur on or near the installation. Specific natural disasters will differ in scope and effects. Therefore,
   response, recovery and mitigation actions will vary. A national-level response will be required to help
   Air Force installations recover from extensive natural disasters.
   4.7.2. Natural disasters include earthquakes, extreme heat or cold, floods and flash floods, hurricanes
   or typhoons, landslides and mudflows, thunderstorms and lightning, tornadoes, straight-line winds
   (see Attachment 1 for definition), cyclones, tsunamis, volcanoes, wildland fires, avalanches, winter
   storms, and natural outbreaks of disease.
   4.7.3. Installations use the ICC and EOC for C2 of resources when responding to and recovering from
   natural disasters. MAJCOMs may choose to deploy all or part of their DRF to support installations
   affected by natural disasters when requested and directed. Commanders must be able to maintain the
   primary installation mission, save lives, mitigate damage and restore mission-essential resources and
   infrastructure after a natural disaster. Base the level of response and actions on the magnitude of the
   disaster and degree of damage.
   4.7.4. Natural Disaster Phases of Incident Management.
       4.7.4.1. Prevention. Most natural disasters cannot be prevented. Vaccination of personnel or the
       use of mass prophylaxis may prevent the spread of naturally occurring disease to installation per-
       sonnel. For other disasters, installations can only take measures aimed at mitigating the effects of
       natural disasters. These measures are addressed under preparedness or mitigation.
       4.7.4.2. Preparation. Natural disaster preparedness includes any actions taken in anticipation of a
       natural disaster such as implementing the CEMP 10-2, Annex B and appropriate Appendices.
       Training and exercises are critical elements of natural disaster preparedness and should be empha-
       sized at all levels. Commanders and staff agency chiefs must ensure procedures are developed for
       personnel notification, recall and accounting. They also must implement actions to protect
       resources and report injuries and damage. Units should integrate protective measures into the
       installation's overall preparations for a natural disaster. Examples of actions to take include imple-
       menting weather advisories and warning notifications, initiating treatment activities during natural
62                   AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008


        outbreaks of disease, preparing installation housing residents to evacuate and developing MAAs
        with local civil authorities. The EM information program makes an important contribution to pre-
        paredness by emphasizing actions that installation personnel can take on their own such as harden-
        ing, securing, dispersing and evacuation preparations.
        4.7.4.3. Response. As with major accidents, natural disaster response has three overlapping
        phases: notification, response and evacuation.
            4.7.4.3.1. The notification phase consists of actions taken in anticipation of a natural disaster.
            Actions may not be executable if a natural disaster occurs with little or no warning. During the
            notification phase, establish C2, notify the installation populace and response agencies, protect
            materials and facilities, consider sheltering or evacuating personnel, coordinate with civil
            authorities and begin collecting data for reports.
            4.7.4.3.2. During response, maintain C2, assess damage, conduct fire fighting, conduct search
            and rescue, prevent illness and injury, care for casualties, establish cordons, protect property,
            restore utilities and communications and continue collecting data for reports.
            4.7.4.3.3. Evacuation is defined in Attachment 1. Evacuation of aircraft before a hurricane
            often precedes the evacuation of installation personnel due to the arrangements that must be
            made at the receiving installation for the evacuating aircraft. People are also evacuated due to
            floods, forest fires and other natural disasters.
        4.7.4.4. Recovery. The recovery phase for natural disasters consists of actions taken after emer-
        gency actions have been implemented and lifesaving actions have been completed. All installation
        agencies may be involved in installation recovery following natural disasters. Recovery efforts
        restore the area and operations to normal conditions. Recovery may involve dividing the installa-
        tion into sectors and assigning each unit a sector for recovery actions if a natural disaster affects
        the entire installation. The EOC develops and implements a recovery plan that the Installation
        Commander approves. Desired outcomes of the recovery phase are to reestablish mission capabil-
        ity, prepare to handle personnel and claims actions, return to normal operations and provide neces-
        sary reports.
        4.7.4.5. Mitigation. Natural disasters can create emergency conditions that vary widely in scope,
        urgency and degree of damage. Installations must establish procedures and identify or obtain
        material to protect their resources from susceptible threats. Installations should pre-plan to isolate
        or shut off utilities, fuel and electrical and water systems that are affected by the natural disaster on
        or near the installation.
     4.7.5. Specific natural disaster responses will be required for the natural disasters listed in paragraph
     4.7.2. Natural disaster responses may be modified during expeditionary operations.
        4.7.5.1. Consider the overall situation and threat when responding to natural disasters during
        expeditionary operations. Mission requirements and available resources will dictate procedures
        and priorities. Use the minimum resources possible to respond to the natural disaster and its
        effects without impairing mission capability. See Attachment 1 for definitions of expeditionary
        operations and expeditionary units.
        4.7.5.2. The Installation Commander decides whether to evacuate or to shelter-in-place.
        4.7.5.3. Commanders of expeditionary operations must coordinate evacuation planning at the
        local, theater and DOS levels.
AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008                                                 63


4.8. Contingency and Wartime Attack with Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and
High-Yield Explosive (CBRNE) Weapons (referred to hereafter as CBRNE Attack).
   4.8.1. All units must develop contingency plans and conduct training and exercises for both their
   home station and their deployment location. They must develop plans, training, contingency response
   checklists and exercises based upon a realistic threat and assessment of resources that will be available
   in a contingency. Naturally occurring disease outbreaks, such as pandemic influenza, may create oper-
   ational challenges similar to those of a biological attack, while also presenting unique circumstances.
   Response actions will be similar for both situations. Plans, training, and response checklists and exer-
   cises must take these circumstances into account. Deliberate plans that rely upon in-place resources,
   such as a hardened facility or collective protection facilities, may not be executable at austere loca-
   tions, especially during the response and recovery phases. Units must train and exercise their forces to
   develop alternate methods or work-around procedures if critical resources are destroyed or if
   mutual-aid resources, host nation support or incoming forces are unavailable.
   4.8.2. The CBRNE attack threat may come from traditional CBRNE weapons or may be new com-
   pounds and organisms. Military involvement to advance and protect US interests may include war
   operations, peace operations, homeland defense and civil support, foreign humanitarian assistance
   and other DSCA. Commanders must consider the impacts of a potential adversary's CBRNE abilities
   in the geographic region. Attacks can come from a wide array of conventional or asymmetrical
   threats, including missiles, artillery, mortar, unmanned aerial vehicles, Vehicle-Borne Improvised
   Explosive Devices (VBIED), IEDs, vehicle sprayers, backpack sprayers, aircraft, or ground forces.
   Adversaries may use CBRNE weapons and other materials in a widespread manner or in a limited,
   focused manner to achieve specific effects.
      4.8.2.1. The AFOSI and intelligence communities conduct local threat assessments annually,
      when significant threat changes occur and before deployments.
      4.8.2.2. Each installation must conduct vulnerability assessments IAW AFI 10-245. Forces that
      are deployed as part of a fragmented UTC should be briefed on the most recent deployed location
      vulnerability assessment.
      4.8.2.3. Annual reviews of the passive defense and consequence management programs may
      require adjustments to installation operations. Changes in threats or vulnerability assessments may
      also require revisions in planning and operations.
      4.8.2.4. JP 3-11, Joint Doctrine for Operations in Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) Envi-
      ronments, provides a framework to assess the threat posed by an adversary possessing, or sus-
      pected of possessing, CBRN weapons.
   4.8.3. Installation Commanders must provide the maximum possible protection for assigned person-
   nel, materiels, equipment and facilities against the effects of enemy attacks.
      4.8.3.1. Commanders must develop a plan appropriate to their mission and threat, such as the
      installation ESP or the CEMP 10-2. For example, during increased alert, unit commanders recall
      or provide instructions to personnel away from their home duty station. Commanders must
      develop plans that allow them to complete that recall in the most effective manner possible.
      4.8.3.2. CBRNE passive defense measures are designed to improve the capability of personnel to
      survive and sustain operations in CBRNE environments. The major elements are contamination
      avoidance, protection and contamination control.
64                  AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008


        4.8.3.3. Protective actions are taken in stages equal to the immediacy and nature of the threat. Use
        MAJCOM and local instructions and the installation notification and warning systems to direct the
        proper protective posture. When there is strategic warning of an increased attack threat, forces will
        increase defense readiness IAW declared theater alert states and stages.
     4.8.4. CBRNE Attack Phases of Incident Management.
        4.8.4.1. Prevention. The EM Program cannot prevent CBRNE attacks. The only measures that
        help mitigate the consequences of CBRNE attacks are more appropriately addressed under pre-
        paredness, recovery, response and mitigation.
        4.8.4.2. Preparedness. Responders must be trained within their areas of responsibility to employ
        PPE, determine the extent of contamination, control entry and exit to contain the spread of con-
        tamination, decontaminate their own personnel and equipment, conduct mass decontamination,
        evacuate casualties and initiate recovery operations. They must participate in training and exer-
        cises to incorporate CBRNE response capabilities into ongoing operations. The Installation Com-
        mander should ensure that existing base shelters and facility shelter plans are evaluated to
        implement shelter in-place protection. Another example of preparedness for terrorist use of
        CBRNE is to inspect and maintain CBRNE response equipment and supplies to ensure they are
        ready for immediate use.
           4.8.4.2.1. Many actions help prepare forces for operations in CBRNE threat areas. Such
           actions require a readiness strategy designed to train, equip and exercise forces to counter the
           expected threats. This strategy includes training and equipping personnel, identifying short-
           falls and limiting factors and developing or reviewing installation and joint support plans.
           4.8.4.2.2. The EM program must integrate with other efforts, such as physical security, critical
           infrastructure protection and preventive medicine, to provide the total force preparedness
           against all threats. Other examples of necessary steps include assigning areas of responsibility
           for PAR teams or establishing environmental and medical baselines for the installation such as
           those required by AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness and Planning; AFI 48-102, Medical Ento-
           mology Program; AFOSHSTD 48-8, Controlling Exposures To Hazardous Materials; and AFI
           48-119, Medical Service Environmental Quality Programs.
        4.8.4.3. Response. Actions taken before, during and after the attack are critical to force surviv-
        ability and mission continuation. All personnel must know the meanings of the alarm conditions
        and MOPP levels; actions to take; where and how to take cover, how to report enemy sightings,
        provide owner-user security and wear IPE. They must perform self monitoring for signs and
        symptoms of chemical or biological exposure. Specific plans and procedures may be required to
        continue mission operations and must be coordinated with and supported by EM plans.
        4.8.4.4. Recovery. Successful recovery efforts require a coordinated and integrated approach. The
        recovery concept involves a combined effort from personnel trained to operate as a team, using
        specialized equipment to spearhead recovery efforts. The EOC will provide C2 for recovery oper-
        ations and direct team efforts for damage assessment after an attack. The commander must direct
        actions that determine the extent of contamination and damage. Then, the ICC, with advice from
        the EOC, must establish, prioritize and direct recovery actions to restore mission capability and
        protect personnel. Only personnel involved in the recovery actions should be allowed outside until
        hazards have been identified and marked. Each unit and facility will assign and control PAR
AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008                                                  65


      teams. These teams will report to their UCC, which will provide the reported information to the
      EOC.
      4.8.4.5. Mitigation. Mitigation measures against CBRNE attack include actions such as vulnera-
      bility and threat assessments. Mitigation also includes developing and testing the shelter program
      to provide the best available physical protection for personnel from the effects of an attack. As
      with all incidents, an important form of mitigation includes developing and implementing
      response plans, checklists and operating instructions. Also common to all mitigation efforts is the
      requirement to train and equip personnel, including specialized teams.
      4.8.4.6. The AFIMS structure will be used for CBRNE incident response by Air Force units
      including home station and expeditionary operations. The CEMP 10-2 provides checklists for
      shelter operations. The CBRNE attack checklist provides common tasks for CBRNE material and
      conventional attack response.

4.9. Terrorist Use of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and High-Yield Explosive
(CBRNE) Materials, Including Toxic Industrial Chemicals or Toxic Industrial Materials (TIC/
TIM).
   4.9.1. Terrorism, IAW the NRP, is "...any activity that involves an act that is dangerous to human life
   or potentially destructive of critical infrastructure or key resources; and is a violation of the criminal
   laws of the United States or of any State or other subdivision of the United States. This act appears to
   be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; to influence the policy of a government by
   intimidation or coercion; or to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination,
   or kidnapping."
   4.9.2. Terrorist use of CBRNE materials is separated from CBRNE warfare because of the legal
   requirements for handling the terrorist incident as a crime scene and preserving evidence. All respond-
   ers will be under close scrutiny and must be aware of evidence collection and preservation require-
   ments. They must also be aware of the need to follow peacetime rules and regulations such as OSHA
   standards.
   4.9.3. Each installation is required to conduct vulnerability assessments annually IAW AFI 10-245.
   The assessment must include the installation’s vulnerability to terrorist use of CBRNE materials.
   4.9.4. Terrorist Use of CBRNE Phases of Incident Management.
      4.9.4.1. Prevention. The EM Program cannot prevent terrorist use of CBRNE. The only measures
      that help mitigate the consequences of such attacks are more appropriately addressed under pre-
      paredness, recovery, response and mitigation..
      4.9.4.2. Preparation. Preparation for terrorist use of CBRNE parallels those actions listed in para-
      graph 4.8.4.2. Terrorist use of CBRNE materials is separated from CBRNE warfare because of the
      legal requirements for handling the terrorist incident as a crime scene and preserving evidence.
      This separation must be accounted for during planning, training, and equipping activities.
      4.9.4.3. Response. Response to terrorist use of CBRNE requires many of the same response
      actions as other types of incidents; however, responders must also establish and maintain a chain
      of custody for evidence preservation as directed by the IC. Responders must be alert for physical
      indicators and other outward warning signs of additional CBRNE events, including armed assault.
66                 AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008


       Also, they must consider the potential for secondary attack, such as chemical dispersal devices,
       secondary explosive devices or booby traps.
       4.9.4.4. Recovery. Throughout the recovery phase, responders must continue to ensure that evi-
       dence is preserved. They may need to relinquish authority to the FBI or other authority for evi-
       dence collection or crime scene preservation, although life saving activities will always have
       priority over these actions. A mission recovery plan will be developed IAW CEMP 10-2. Recov-
       ery programs include mitigation components designed to avoid damage from future incidents.
       Long-term recovery may include cleanup and restoration.
       4.9.4.5. Mitigation. Mitigation occurs throughout preparedness, prevention, response and recov-
       ery. Responders must develop operational and tactical safety and security plans. The installation
       must conduct and update the vulnerability assessment IAW AFI 10-245. The EOC must be pre-
       pared to deploy resources in response to specific threats or potential incidents. Another form of
       mitigation is ongoing educational activities designed to reduce loss of life and destruction of prop-
       erty.

4.10. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and High-Yield Explosive (CBRNE) Control
Center. The CBRNE Control Center is managed under ESF 5, Emergency Management. The control cen-
ter is subordinate to the EOC director and serves as an advisory element to the EOC and the Installation
Commander. The control center directs CBRN reconnaissance activities to shape the hazards and advises
the commander on hazards, countermeasures and protective actions. The CBRNE Control Center plots
and maintains CBRN hazards status on the airbase, in off-base areas of operational concern and at poten-
tial recovery bases. The CBRNE Control Center also conducts CBRN and release other than attack
(ROTA) plotting and reporting activities IAW AF Tactic, Technique, Procedure (Interservice) (AFTTP(I))

                                                Chapter 5

           AIR FORCE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (EM) PROGRAM LOGISTICS

5.1. Purpose. This chapter provides Air Force EM program logistics information. Information includes
policy and guidance for funding, obtaining, and maintaining equipment and supplies to support the Air
Force EM program. It also provides information specific to use of AS, installation EM response equip-
ment, IPE, PPE, equipment storage and equipment funding, and reporting.

5.2. General Information. Equipment must be available to mitigate incidents, restore, and sustain mis-
sion operations, and train for EM situations. COCOM, MAJCOM, and installation plans will identify
types and quantities of EM equipment and supplies needed for each employment area. Equipment is
required for installation response functions such as the EOC and UCCs, specialized teams, and individu-
als. Equipment, including communications equipment, should be compatible with and interoperable with
on-base and off-base agencies.

5.3. Allowance Standards (AS). An AS lists prescribed items and quantities of equipment that can be
purchased and made available for EM. Some items are not listed in the AS, such as expendable items or
supply catalog items. In addition, some CBRNE defense equipment items are being processed into AS
and are not yet listed. Such equipment is listed in the Baseline Equipment Data Assessment List
(BEDAL). Table 5.1. lists primary AS that prescribe items and quantities of non-medical equipment to
support the Air Force EM program. MEFPAK Responsible Agent maintains AS for medical emergency
response equipment.

Table 5.1. Non-Medical Allowance Standards (AS) for Emergency Management (EM) Supplies and
Equipment.
                Allowance
                          Title
                Standard
            1. AS 016C       Chemical Warfare Defense Equipment (clothing and textiles)
            2. AS 019        Vehicles
            3. AS 459        CBRN equipment
            4. AS 538        Small Arms and SF equipment
            5. AS 660        Communications equipment

     5.3.1. To determine equipment needs, evaluate the installation or unit mission and threat; then pur-
     chase only the material needed to respond to that threat. Maintain spare parts for user-level mainte-
     nance. Base stock levels on anticipated consumption during scheduled maintenance, EM operations,
     training, and exercises.
     5.3.2. Needs may fall into various categories such as mobility, C2, EOC, UCC, team, and individual
     capabilities such as shelter management or detection. AFI 23-102, Operational Requirements Instruc-
     tions for Determining Materiel Requirements for Reparable Items, and AFI 23-103, Determining
     Materiel Requirement for Air Force-Managed Consumable Items are two of several 23-series publica-
     tions that provide detailed guidance on determining need. Installations may not stock supplies solely
     for the purpose of DSCA, as directed in DODD 3025.15, unless otherwise directed by the SecDef.
AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008                                                 69


5.4. Installation Emergency Management (EM) Response Equipment. The Installation Commander
will ensure that all responders have adequate EM response equipment to respond to any incident that
threatens the installation. MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs may specify minimum equipment requirements
for subordinate units. Installations must budget for, acquire, and maintain equipment for natural disasters,
major accidents or incidents, and response on or off base.
5.4. (AFMC) Installation Emergency Management (EM) Response Equipment. AFRL GSUs will, in
coordination with host and supported installation REMF/REMO, maintain the requisite type and amount
of EM response equipment based on threats and support requirements at the location.
   5.4.1. The CE Readiness Flight and the CBRNE Medical Defense Officer will address the status of
   installation EM response equipment, both medical and non-medical, at the EMWG meeting. Before
   the meeting, the CE Readiness Flight will review the consolidated list of non-medical EM response
   equipment requirements, then present this list to the EMWG. The EMWG will then prioritize the list
   for approval and inclusion in installation budget submissions. The EMWG will monitor funding allo-
   cation and acquisition to ensure the installation EM capability is subsequently established.
   5.4.2. The CBRNE Medical Defense Officer will provide a consolidated, prioritized list of EM med-
   ical equipment requirements through the EMWG to the installation FPEC. The medical list will be
   submitted to MAJCOM SG for coordination.
   5.4.3. The Installation Comptroller will coordinate the disbursement of EM program funding
   received from MAJCOM budget allocations through the EMWG to ensure funding is applied against
   the EMWG-approved consolidated non-medical EM priority equipment requirements list prescribed
   in paragraph 5.4.1.
   5.4.4. Team Equipment. Some personnel assigned to teams may require additional specialized protec-
   tive equipment for their EM missions. Use the AS or BEDAL to validate these requirements.
   5.4.5. Mobile Emergency Operations Center. The MEOC is an emergency response vehicle assigned
   to the CE Readiness Flight. It provides the IC with command, control, and communications support
   for emergency response and recovery operations. The MEOC will meet minimum DHS/FEMA Type
   II communications capabilities, including capability to exchange data with the EOC. MAJCOM/A7
   will validate each of their installations’ MEOC requirements. The AFIMS MEOC requirements will
   be included in AS 019, when revised. The MEOC is a priority vehicle IAW AFI 24-301, Vehicle Oper-
   ations.
   5.4.5. (AFMC) MEOC is not required at Brooks City-Base.
   5.4.6. CBRNE Incident Response Equipment. The BEDAL guides typical non-medical CBRNE inci-
   dent equipment requirements for response to terrorist use of CBRNE. Information in the BEDAL will
   transition into the appropriate allowance standards. The equipment on the BEDAL is to build upon
   existing HAZMAT team equipment. The added equipment will allow response teams to continue lim-
   ited mission operations and to eventually restore mission capabilities following a terrorist use of
   CBRNE. Equipment purchased to meet BEDAL guidance must be inventoried and accounted for
   using proper supply accountability procedures in accordance with AFMAN 23-110. Detailed guid-
   ance for accountability will be contained in supporting manuals to this AFI. Medical CBRNE Incident
   Response Equipment allowances are listed in the 886-series AS, which can be found on the Air Force
   Medical Logistics web site under "Medical Readiness."

     5.4.7. War reserve materiel (WRM) can be used to support domestic incidents, but approval will be
     obtained from the WRM releasing authority IAW AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Program
     Guidance and Procedures. When WRM is used to support domestic incidents, notify the approving
     authority as soon as possible.

5.5. Unit Emergency Management (EM) Response Equipment. Unit commanders must identify
requirements then budget for, obtain, store, and maintain material needed to accomplish their specific
functional EM tasks in support of response plans. Unit emergency response equipment includes items to
support unit EM missions such as shelter management, PAR, and CCA team taskings. Unit equipment
does not include items issued to individuals, such as IPE. Units will maintain the minimum materials
needed for tasked response and support. Supplement or rotate consumable supplies and shelf-life-coded
equipment with day-to-day operating stocks.
5.5. (WRIGHTPATTERSON) Unit Emergency Management (EM) Response Equipment. Unit EOC
Representatives will be equipped with the minimum equipment as follows:
 - Rain Gear/Cold Weather Gear
 - Response Kit (Checklists, Flashlight, Base Grid Map, Reflective Belt, radio or cell phone)
     5.5.1. Unit commanders must ensure unit material, including material in bulk storage, is properly
     maintained and inventoried. Units must budget to repair and replace equipment and consumables
     based on shelf-life expiration, service-life expiration, and unserviceable condition. Supplement or
     rotate this material with day-to-day operating stocks.
     5.5.1. (WRIGHTPATTERSON) Unit EM Representatives will coordinate with Unit Deployment
     Managers (UDM’s) to ensure stored equipment is maintained IAW applicable Technical Orders
     (T.O.‘s). Representatives will use the Quarterly Unit EM Report to document the status of inspection
     dates of stored equipment.
     5.5.2. Units must identify and mark training equipment IAW T.O.s. Do NOT store training equipment
     with operational equipment.
     5.5.2. (WRIGHTPATTERSON) Unit EM Representatives will obtain “Training Only” stencils for
     the marking of training equipment from 88 ABW/CECMX.

5.6. Program Element (PE) Codes. Units will use the PE codes in Table 5.2., EM-Related Program
Elements, to purchase authorized EM response equipment and supplies.

5.7. Individual Protective Equipment (IPE) and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
   5.7.1. IPE is personal clothing and equipment required to protect an individual from chemical, bio-
   logical, and some nuclear effects in a CBRN-warfare environment. The protective mask also protects
   the respiratory tract from radioactive particles. IPE items may, but do not necessarily, meet the
   requirements of PPE for emergency response where Occupational Safety and Health Administration
   (OSHA) or Air Force Occupational and Environmental Safety, Fire Protection, and Health (AFOSH)
   standards apply.
   5.7.2. The need to issue IPE is determined by the individual’s location in or deployment to the areas
   listed in Table 4.1., Worldwide CBRNE Threat Area Table or by the COCOM reporting instructions.
      5.7.2.1. All military and emergency-essential civilians in HTAs and MTAs are authorized C-1 and
      C-Bag sustainment assets. See Table 5.3., Air Force-Wide UTC Availability and Tasking Sum-
      mary (AFWUS) Code/C-1 Bag Authorizations. AFWUS Codes are defined in AFI 10-401. Also,
      Table 5.4., CBRNE IPE, lists C-1 bag contents. Issue two complete operational ground crew
      ensembles (GCE) per C-1 bag and maintain remaining C-bag assets in the Logistic Readiness
      Squadron (LRS) to allow for shelter and contamination control area (CCA) stocking. All C-Bag
      and sustainment assets will be stored, issued, and deployed IAW MAJCOM guidance. Support
      installations will issue both training and real-world assets to personnel at subordinate GSUs.
      5.7.2.1. (AFMC) Refer to AFMC Instruction 23-250, Mobility Bag, Individual Body Armor, and
      Weapons Management, for AFMC mobility bag guidance.

        5.7.2.2. In LTAs issue a C-1 bag to military and emergency-essential civilians when they are
        tasked for deployment outside of an LTA. C-1 bags are authorized to meet the most stringent
        deployable tasking. LTA C-bag sustainment assets are centrally stored and deployed by the
        CMBCC.
        5.7.2.3. Personnel deploying for Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) deployments to
        MTAs or HTAs: C-bag items may be pre-positioned. Personnel will deploy IAW specific location
        and AOR reporting instructions. Personnel that will be TDY for 20 days or longer to a MTA or
        HTA, other than AEF locations, will bring a complete operational C-1 bag and related field gear,
        including helmet and body armor. Personnel participating in an MTA or HTA operations readiness
        exercise or inspection will bring training IPE components and a protective mask.
        5.7.2.4. MAJCOM A4 and A7 staffs, in coordination with MAJCOM/JA, will review host nation
        support agreements to determine if valid requirements exist to issue IPE to foreign nationals work-
        ing on foreign Air Force installations. If valid requirements exist, MAJCOM A4 staffs will direct
        their installations’ LRS to determine and stock appropriate quantities of IPE. MAJCOM A4 staffs
        will also direct their installations to issue required IPE.
        5.7.2.5. Provide IPE to each United States government civilian and DOD contractor identified as
        emergency-essential and deployable to HTA or MTA areas. See DODI 1400.31, Civilian Work
        Force Contingency and Emergency Planning and Execution, and DODI 3020.37, Continuation of
        Essential DOD Contractor Services During Crisis.
        5.7.2.6. LRS (or equivalent) will maintain a supply of chemical protective overgarments, gloves,
        inserts, and overboots for training and exercise purposes for participating Air Force military and
        civilian members. Use the same operational protective mask for both training and real-world oper-
        ations. Individuals declared hard-to-fit by the Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight personnel
        during QNFT and issued an M-45 mask will deploy with the M-45 mask. Installations will procure
        and maintain CBRNE IPE. See Table 5.4.
     5.7.3. PPE is equipment designed to protect individuals exposed to hazards from injury or illness in
     non-military unique occupational environments where OSHA or AFOSH standards apply, including
     emergency response to CBRNE incidents in the United States.
        5.7.3.1. At foreign locations, PPE for emergency response operations that meets OSHA or
        AFOSH standards may be required IAW Final Governing Standards, Overseas Environmental
        Baseline Guidance, and MAJCOM or COCOM policy.
AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008                                            73


       5.7.3.2. PPE used by Air Force emergency responders must be approved by the installation bioen-
       vironmental engineer or Safety personnel (IAW AFOSH standards) before procurement and use.
       Where IPE meets appropriate PPE standards, the bioenvironmental engineer may approve IPE use
       as PPE for emergency response operations. Conversely, responders may use PPE when MOPP
       conditions are declared if the PPE meets or exceeds IPE protection and its use has been coordi-
       nated with the installation bioenvironmental engineer.
       5.7.3.3. Each installation DRF team or function will coordinate anticipated emergency response
       operations they will support under the installation CEMP 10-2, potential hazards, and PPE
       requirements with the local bioenvironmental engineer and Safety to determine the type and quan-
       tity of PPE required.

5.8. Funding and Reporting. Mobility bag funding and reporting procedures are completed IAW
AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, USAF Supply Manual. MAJCOM/A4RS report mobility bag status to Air
Staff using the current RCS report format. MAJCOM/LGS or equivalent will send a single, consolidated
report to AF/A4RD. Subsequently, AF/A4RD will provide a consolidated report to AF/A7CX. Installa-
tions submit reports to their MAJCOM IAW the schedule shown in Table 5.5. Mobility Bag Reporting
Schedule, unless directed otherwise by the MAJCOM.
5.8. (AFMC) Funding and Reporting. HQ AFMC/A4RD is the OPR for mobility bag surveillance.

AIR FORCE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (EM) PROGRAM EDUCATION AND TRAINING

6.1. Purpose. This chapter provides Air Force EM program education and training policy and guidance
including objectives, responsibilities, requirements, and courses. Air Force EM education and training
applies to the all-hazards concept of integrating cross-functional education and training into the Air Force
EM program.

6.2. Training Objective. The objective of Air Force EM training is to provide the required knowledge
and skills to prepare for, prevent, respond to, recover from, and mitigate contingencies or emergencies
requiring Air Force response. AETC formal courses and installation-level training increase knowledge
and proficiency for response operations. Additionally, Air Force EM education and training complies
with Federal, DOD, Joint, and national consensus standards in meeting training levels, frequency, and
comprehensiveness. Air Force EM education and training must include realistic exercises and scenarios
demonstrating the level of proficiency required for evaluation purposes.

6.3. Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Education and Training Policy. The target audience
for Air Force EM education and training includes personnel specified in Table 6.1., Major Accident and
CBRNE Response Education and Training; Table 6.2., HAZMAT Minimum Training and Certification
Requirements, and Table 6.3., Air Force EM Program Education and Training. Personnel will attend the
courses listed in the tables to meet the level of proficiency needed to accomplish their assigned tasks.

6.4. Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Education and Training Requirements.
   6.4.1. Only military, civilian, or contractor personnel who complete the AETC Readiness Apprentice
   Course or CE Readiness Flight Officer Course may instruct courses listed in paragraph 6.6., unless
   otherwise specified. These instructors must be task certified and the certification documented annu-
   ally by a CE Readiness Technician IAW AFI 36-2201, Volume 3. Military task certification is docu-
   mented on AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training and placed in the
   trainee’s AF Form 623, OJT Record. Civilian task certification will be documented in the employee’s
   records IAW AFI 36-401, Employee Training and Development, and contractors’ task certification
   will be documented IAW their contract or corporate requirements. New contracts for contracted CE
   Readiness Flight positions that include instructor duties must require completion of the AETC Readi-
   ness Apprentice Course or CE Readiness Flight Officer Course. Newly hired contractors must com-
   plete training before instructing or as soon as possible. Contractors hired prior to the effective date of
   this requirement must obtain this training as soon as possible to continue instructing.
   6.4.1. (AFMC) Readiness and Emergency Management Functional Area Staff or Quality Assurance
   Personnel will task certify contractors on instructor fundamentals. Document certification IAW Qual-
   ity Control Plan or automated training documentation system.

   6.4.7. CBRNE defense courses meet Air Force proficiency standards based on two international stan-
   dardization agreements: NATO STANAG 2150 and Air Standardization Coordinating Committee
   (ASCC) Air Standard 84/8, Initial, Continuation and Unit NBC Training Standards.
   6.4.8. This AFI addresses aspects of passive CBRNE defense education and training. MAJCOMs,
   ANG, FOAs, and DRUs may tailor their Air Force EM education and training programs to their spe-
   cific mission requirements by supplementing this AFI.
   6.4.9. Personnel going TDY to or deploying to an MTA or HTA must be current in CBRNE defense
   at the time of departure and for the duration of the TDY or deployment. They will receive local condi-
   tions training when they arrive at the TDY or deployment location.
   6.4.9. (WRIGHTPATTERSON) Unit designated CBRNE scheduler(s) will schedule all personnel
   (Military or civilian) requiring CBRNE training with the 88 ABW/CECMX.
   6.4.10. Aircrew members receive CBRNE defense education and training from several functional
   areas. Aircrew Life Support provides education and training on aircrew IPE and processing personnel
   through the aircrew contamination control area (ACCA). Flight Medicine provides training on agent
   toxicology and pharmacology. The CE Readiness Flight provides education and training on ground
   crew CBRNE operations and standards on a 20-month cycle.
   6.4.11. Personnel must be proficient in the wear of the protective mask before attending weapons
   qualification through the Air Force Qualification Course or the Tactical Rifle Qualification Course
   conducted by Air Force Combat Arms Training and Maintenance (CATM) instructors.

6.5. Education and Training Program Formats. Most courses in this chapter are currently conducted
and evaluated in a traditional instructor-led classroom or field environment. However, Air Force EM edu-
cation and training is transitioning to blended learning. Blended learning includes two distinctive parts:
individual knowledge-based objectives and individual demonstration-performance objectives. The use of
blended learning standardizes education and training objectives and increases student retention and com-
prehension.
   6.5.1. Individual knowledge-based objectives use Learning Management System (LMS) technologies
   via the web to deliver consistent, up-to-date education and training. This format allows academic
   self-paced learning and provides students increased access to course materials. Use of these technolo-
   gies also allows for critical education and training data analysis at the installation and Air Force lev-
   els. Until each course is fielded, instructors will use the course proficiency standards for knowledge
   and performance outlined in the Air Force Readiness Training Packages (RTP).
       6.5.1.1. Completion of computer-based Air Force EM education and training products for courses
       discussed in this chapter becomes mandatory as they are fielded and IAW the accompanying prod-
       uct implementation guidance.
       6.5.1.2. Current CD-formatted Air Force EM education and training products are mandatory to
       complete until products are transitioned to a web-delivered format.
       6.5.1.3. A listing of fielded EM education and training products is located on the Air Force Portal.
       Web-delivered products can be found at https://golearn.csd.disa.mil/.
       6.5.1.4. CE Readiness Flight instructors will provide individual knowledge-based objectives for
       courses listed in this chapter that are not currently available via CD or web-delivered format. Air
 82                   AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008


         Force RTP will provide individual knowledge-based and performance based objectives for
         courses listed in this chapter that are not currently available via CD or web-delivered format.
         6.5.1.5. Each individual must create an account on the Air Force EM program LMS site from a
         computer with military internet access. Once an account is created, EM education and training
         products can be accessed and completed from any computer with internet access.
         6.5.1.6. Personnel who need assistance determining course requirements, accessing course mate-
         rial, addressing technical issues, or have questions concerning EM training products should con-
         tact their Unit EM Representative, CE Readiness Flight or the HQ AFCESA Reach Back Center at
         DSN 523-6995 or 1-888-AFCESA1 (888-232-3721). Frequently asked questions concerning EM
         training products can be found on the Air Force Portal or on the Air Force EM program LMS site.
         6.5.1.7. Individual knowledge-based objectives must be completed within 15 consecutive days of
         start by active duty military, civilian, or contract personnel or within two Unit Training Assem-
         blies (UTA) by ARC personnel. Group or team completion of individual knowledge-based objec-
         tives is not authorized.
      6.5.2. Individual demonstration-performance objectives focus on common core skills. After a student
      completes the knowledge-based objectives, CE Readiness Flight instructors will train and evaluate
      individual demonstration-performance objectives.
         6.5.2.1. Some courses listed in this chapter do not contain individual demonstration-performance
         objectives; however they contain localized procedures that must be presented to the individual by
         the CE Readiness Flight or other functional areas as identified in this chapter.
         6.5.2.2. Unit commanders must ensure personnel complete individual demonstration-perfor-
         mance objectives no later than 60 days after completing individual knowledge-based objectives.
         6.5.2.3. Duration for the demonstration-performance portion of education and training is approx-
         imate, based on covering Air Force standard demonstration-performance objectives, local proce-
         dures, and requirements. Duration is affected by student proficiency levels.
      6.5.3. Unless otherwise noted in this chapter, personnel do not receive credit for completing a course
      until both individual objectives have been completed.

      6.6.1.1. CBRNE Defense Orientation provides basic knowledge of the CBRNE threat, protective
      equipment and actions to survive a CBRNE attack or event. It is conducted during Basic Military
      Training School (BMTS) and is a one-time requirement, which prepares new Airmen for the
      CBRNE Defense Awareness Course. All newly commissioned officers are required to take the
      CBRNE Defense Awareness Course (web based training) within 90 days of initial assignment.
      6.6.1.2. CBRNE Defense Awareness Course consists of individual knowledge-based objectives
      that provide in-depth knowledge of CBRNE defense hazards and protective actions. The course
      provides IPE inspection, use and wear procedures and incorporates the explosive ordnance recon-
      naissance (EOR) training.
         6.6.1.2.1. This web-delivered course is self-paced.
         6.6.1.2.2. The course is accomplished every 20 months by all Air Force personnel, regardless
         of deployment status or AFWUS coding. The exception to this policy is students in initial
         skills training pipelines lasting longer than 12 months. These individuals will be required to
         receive their training within 90 days of in processing into their first permanent duty location

        after the award of their AFSC. This course is a pre-requisite to the CBRNE Defense Survival
        Skills Course.
        6.6.1.2.3. A course completion certificate is provided upon successful completion of the
        course. This certificate must be printed out, and taken to the CE Readiness and EM Flight
        when scheduled for CBRNE Survival Skills Course (if required). Record completion IAW
        paragraph 6.4.2.
        6.6.1.2.4. Air Force emergency-essential civilians, as defined in AFPAM 10-231, Federal
        Civilian Deployment Guide, must complete the CBRNE Defense Awareness Course every 20
        months if they are stationed in a HTA or MTA; deploying to a HTA or MTA; or identified as
        deployable to a HTA or MTA.
        6.6.1.2.5. Emergency-essential civilians in LTAs will receive JIT training when the CBRNE
        threat increases or when they are assigned to a standard deployable UTC that is tasked to
        deploy to a HTA or MTA.
        6.6.1.2.6. Air Force civilian, contract, and host nation personnel will complete the CBRNE
        Defense Awareness Course every 20 months when it is a requirement or condition of employ-
        ment, the governing contract or agreement; addressed in a host nation support agreement; or
        when the installation or senior Air Force official deems this training essential for the perfor-
        mance of their duties.
        6.6.1.2.7. After completing this course, most personnel also complete the CBRNE Defense
        Survival Skills Course. LTA personnel who are AFWUS coded AXX or DXX only require
        CBRNE Defense Awareness every 20 months until their code changes or they are tasked to
        deploy to a MTA or a HTA. Then, they must complete the CBRNE Defense Survival Skills
        Course within 60 days.
     6.6.1.3. CBRNE Defense Survival Skills Course consists of individual and team demo-perfor-
     mance objectives that provide hands-on training and evaluation of knowledge acquired during the
     CBRNE Defense Awareness Course. It also prepares personnel to perform their mission critical
     tasks during their CBRNE Functional Area TQT
     6.6.1.3. (AFMC) CBRNE Defense Survival Skills Course will include mask confidence chamber
     exercises every 3 years.
     6.6.1.3. (WRIGHTPATTERSON) 88 ABW/CECMX will conduct mask confidence chamber
     exercises annually from (1 May to 31 Oct).
        6.6.1.3.1. This course is conducted by Readiness and Emergency Management Flight.
        6.6.1.3.2. The course is required every 20 months. It must be completed within 60 days after
        the CBRNE Defense Awareness Course by active duty military, civilian or contract personnel
        or within four UTAs by ARC personnel.
        6.6.1.3.3. Air Force emergency-essential civilians, as defined in AFPAM 10-231, Federal
        Civilian Deployment Guide, must complete the CBRNE Defense Survival Skills Course every
        20 months if they are stationed in a HTA or MTA; deploying to a HTA or MTA; or identified
        as deployable to a HTA or MTA.

       6.6.1.3.4. Emergency-essential civilians in LTAs will receive JIT training when the CBRNE
       threat increases or when they are assigned to a standard deployable UTC that is tasked to
       deploy to a HTA or MTA.
       6.6.1.3.5. Air Force civilian, contract, and host nation personnel will complete the CBRNE
       Defense Survival Skills Course every 20 months when it is a requirement or condition of
       employment, the governing contract or agreement; addressed in a host nation support agree-
       ment; or when the installation or senior Air Force official deems this training essential for the
       performance of their duties.
       6.6.1.3.6. Individuals medically exempt from duty IAW AFI 48-123 are exempt from the
       CBRNE Defense Survival Skills Course. Personnel must complete training no later than 60
       days after exemptions or waivers have expired.
       6.6.1.3.7. Personnel will comply with the requirements in Table 6.4., CBRNE Defense Sur-
       vival Skills Course Requirements.
    6.6.1.4. EOD personnel receive functional training that duplicates most CBRNE Defense Sur-
    vival Skills Course material. EOD personnel need to accomplish the CBRNE Defense Awareness
    Course and will receive CBRNE Defense Survival Skills training only on CBRNE threat-specific
    procedures. See AFI 32-3001, Explosive Ordnance Disposal Program.

90               AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008


        6.6.1.15.1. This web-delivered, computer-based course is designed for Installation and Group
        Commanders, ICC and EOC members, and other key personnel identified by CFMs. It
        includes 1 hour of classroom or demonstration-performance training.
        6.6.1.15.2. This course may also be used to provide senior leaders an overview of CBRNE
        defense and counter CBRNE operations, including information about establishing and main-
        taining a COP.
        6.6.1.15.3. Training must be completed every 20 months. Course must be completed within
        15 consecutive work days after starting course by active duty military, civilian, or contract per-
        sonnel or within two UTAs by ARC personnel.
        6.6.1.15.4. Certification is provided at the completion of the course by the CE Readiness
        Flight as required. Record certification IAW paragraph 6.4.2.
        6.6.1.15.5. Additional optional training is available through the Joint Senior Leaders Course
        (JSLC). The JSLC informs leaders about CBRN defense and provides them with a foundation
        of operational and strategic knowledge while emphasizing joint CB defense fundamentals and
        doctrine. The course provides the opportunity for interaction and information exchange with
        CBRN and Homeland Security experts from the Services, Joint Staff, DOD, and other agen-
        cies. The course is conducted by the United States Army Chemical School at Fort Leonard
        Wood, Missouri.
     6.6.1.16. Explosive Ordnance Reconnaissance (EOR) Course is under the guidance of EOD as
     the OPR for this course. CE Readiness Flight will serve as the OPR on installations that do not
     have EOD personnel assigned. The EOR training video (PIN 613523) is no longer a viable train-
     ing option. The primary method for EOR Training Course completion is the LMS. This com-
     puter-based training (CBT) must be completed no more than 60 days, within two UTAs by ARC
     personnel, before personnel attend the CBRNE Defense Course conducted by the CE Readiness
     Flight. Unit schedulers, unit training managers, or unit deployment managers will verify success-
     ful completion of training before an individual is scheduled for the CBRNE Defense Course. The
     only acceptable method of verification is the training certificate.
        6.6.1.16.1. When personnel do not have internet access or cannot otherwise complete the
        web-based training, they can complete the training using an EOR Training Course CD-ROM.
        The installation EOD Flight will maintain copies of the EOR files (to create EOR CDs) for dis-
        tribution to Unit Training Managers. If the installation does not have an EOD Flight, then the
        installation CE Readiness Flight will maintain copies. Instructions for downloading the EOR
        Training Course CD files are available from HQ AFCESA/CEXD.
        6.6.1.16.2. The EOR Training Course CBT reinforces and standardizes individual learning.
        Also, the EOR CBT is a foundational EOR course – the baseline to enhance individual surviv-
        ability. EOD technicians should supplement the EOR CBT by conducting traditional, the-
        ater-specific, instructor-led courses for EOR training in contingency environments.
        6.6.1.16.3. Air National Guard and Reserve units can use en masse training until their instal-
        lation infrastructure supports individualized training via the LMS, or as determined by HQ
        AFRC or HQ ANG. When using en masse training, students must be tested individually. Each
        student must score a minimum of 80 percent (same as CBT) to pass. Tests are available on the
        Air Force Portal EM Community of Practice and from each MAJCOM.

  who evaluate PAR team operations should attend the PAR team course before evaluating those respec-
  tive areas. EET members must maintain the training frequency listed in Table 6.3. for additional
  classes (e.g., SMT, CBRNE Defense) while they are still assigned to EET and still evaluating those
  areas. Once they are no longer assigned to EET or are no longer evaluating those areas, then those per-
  sonnel fall directly under each of the paragraphs for each class (i.e., no longer on EET, and not
  assigned to a SMT, therefore they no longer require SMT training).
     6.6.9.1. The EET Chief will instruct this course and will utilize functional area experts (Fire
     Fighters, Security Forces, Medical, Emergency Management, etc.) to instruct functional-specific
     requirements to ensure a coordinated effort is achieved.

6.7. Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Information Program. The Air Force EM Information
Program provides all personnel assigned to the installation with the knowledge to protect themselves from
effects of and to support unit response to the all-hazard threats to their installation. Information is pro-
vided through two forums: the installation Base Emergency Preparedness Orientation (BEPO) and unit
support of the program.
     6.7.1. BEPO provides an initial orientation to newly assigned members and their dependents on the
     full spectrum of threats that could be encountered at their assignment. Topics include disaster plan-
     ning, major accidents, natural disasters, hazardous materials, terrorism, and first aid.
        6.7.1.1. Localized information, including response procedures and guidance, is provided to per-
        sonnel during a briefing conducted by the CE Readiness Flight typically during "Right Start"
        attendance. Dependents are highly encouraged to attend this briefing.
        6.7.1.2. Standardized knowledge-based information is provided through an automated, interac-
        tive program titled "Are You Ready? – BEPO."
            6.7.1.2.1. This game-show format product is designed for use by all members and their depen-
            dents, including children.

   tives disseminating EM information provided by the CE Readiness Flight to assigned personnel.
       6.7.2.1. Media such as visual aids developed by HQ AFCESA, handouts, posters, base bulletins,
       electronic media, and base newspapers should be used.
       6.7.2.2. The CE Readiness Flight disseminates this information at least quarterly to unit EM Rep-
       resentatives.
       6.7.2.3. Using localized procedures, the CE Readiness Flight will record what information was
       distributed, who received it, and when it was provided.

6.8. Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Education and Training.
   6.8.1. Personnel listed in Table 6.2. must meet the training requirements specified in Table 6.2. The
   DOD HAZMAT certification program, based on National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Stan-
   dards 471 and 472, consists of HAZMAT awareness, operations, technician, and HAZMAT IC train-
   ing levels. The installation HAZMAT emergency planning team will ensure DOD, State, and local
   HAZMAT response training requirements are identified and met.
NOTE: Security Forces and Medical responders will use the 29 CFR 1910.120 training requirements to
train their personnel to respond to CBRNE incidents and do not require DOD certification. CE Readiness
requires successful completion of the DOD HAZMAT Certification Program for the levels identified in
Table 6.2.
   6.8.2. The Air Force, as the employer, has implemented four methods to satisfy the HAZMAT train-
   ing and DOD certification requirements of NFPA Standards 471 and 472. These four methods are:
       6.8.2.1. Reciprocity requires completing an International Fire Service Accreditation Congress or
       National Professional Qualifications Board accredited course.
       6.8.2.2. DOD Certification requires enrolling in and completing the DOD certification courses
       that are available to any DOD employee through the Air Force Institute for Advanced Distributed
       Learning. These courses include 47201, Awareness; 47202, Operations; 47203, Technician; and
       47205, Incident Commander. This method is considered complete when the member passes the
       CerTest final examination, completes the performance test evaluations, and receives DOD certifi-
       cation. See the CerTest Computer-Based Testing Procedural Guide and Policy Guidance. Mem-
       bers of CE administer these tests.
       6.8.2.3. Local Class requires attending a class taught locally by a CE HAZMAT Train-the-Trainer
       course graduate. This method is not considered complete until the member passes the CerTest
       final examination, completes the performance test evaluations, and receives DOD certification,
       unless personnel are exempt from taking CerTest IAW Attachment 5 or Attachment 6 of this
       AFI. Members of CE administer these tests.
       6.8.2.4. Multimedia Training requires completing the multimedia training available on CD-ROM.
       This option allows people who work other than day shifts or those who cannot attend traditional
       classroom training to become trained in the knowledge requirements for the particular level of
96                   AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008


        study. This method is not considered complete until the member passes the CerTest final examina-
        tion, completes the performance test evaluations, and receives DOD certification, unless person-
        nel are exempt from taking CerTest IAW Attachment 5 or Attachment 6 of this AFI. Members of
        CE administer these tests.
     6.8.3. According to 29 CFR 1910.120, HAZMAT training levels and courses are based on the duties
     and functions to be performed by each emergency responder.
        6.8.3.1. The training levels are:
            6.8.3.1.1. First Responder Awareness; as required in Table 6.2., course 1.
            6.8.3.1.2. First Responder Operations; as required in Table 6.2., course 2.
            6.8.3.1.3. HAZMAT Technician; as required in Table 6.2., course 3.
            6.8.3.1.4. HAZMAT Specialist; as required in Table 6.2., course 4.
            6.8.3.1.5. HAZMAT IC; as required in Table 6.2., course 5.
        6.8.3.2. Each level requires initial training and annual refresher training. Level 1 is a prerequisite
        to Level 2, and Level 2 is a prerequisite to Level 3; Level 1 and 2 are prerequisites for Level 4 and
        Levels 1,2, and 3 are prerequisites for Level 5. All contractors assigned to the installation will
        attend the same training required of military or government civilian employees filling the equiva-
        lent position, as defined by the contract. Training for contractors is determined by contract
        requirement as discussed in paragraph 6.4.4.
     6.8.4. Unless exempted in paragraph 6.8.1., initial HAZMAT training will use the DOD HAZMAT
     certification program. Complete refresher training through a formal course, in-service training, partic-
     ipation in real-world incident responses, participation in exercises or a combination of these methods.
     Training for Security Forces is listed in Attachment 5, while training for medical service response
     teams is listed in Attachment 6.
     6.8.5. Supervisors and specialized team chiefs must document HAZMAT annual and refresher train-
     ing in the individual’s training record and certify that the individual is competent to perform the
     assigned duties.
        6.8.5.1. When refresher training is accomplished through real-world response or exercise, the
        training documentation must include a summary of the person’s response that meets the criteria
        for the appropriate level of training, including each competency area listed under the levels of
        training in 29 CFR 1910.120.
        6.8.5.2. Personnel responding to a HAZMAT or CBRNE incident must be trained and current to
        the level specified in Table 6.2. The NIMS Integration Center and DOD plan to provide a
        responder certification process. The Air Force will implement the certification process by provid-
        ing responders the appropriate documentation to identify their credentials to the IC.

7.1. Purpose. This chapter provides Air Force EM program exercise and evaluation, objectives, policy,
and responsibilities. This chapter expands the guidance for the exercise program directed by AFI 90-201,
Inspector General Activities; AFI 10-204, Readiness Exercises and After-Action Reporting Program; and
AFI 10-230, Conduct of Key Exercises and Experiments. Installation Exercise Program Offices, EET
Chiefs, and EET members use this chapter to develop and conduct the installation’s exercise program as
it relates to the Air Force EM program.

7.2. Objectives. The installation exercise program has three objectives:
   7.2.1. To provide the Installation Commander a means to plan and conduct realistic, integrated exer-
   cises, and training for all installation personnel.
   7.2.2. To maximize the benefits gained through exercises and provide accurate, honest feedback to
   commanders for planning, preparation, and training purposes. Specifically, the exercise program and
   evaluator training strive to enhance readiness, boost capabilities, streamline procedures, and improve
   mission readiness.
   7.2.3. To establish the minimum exercise and evaluation criteria for the following areas of the instal-
   lation EM program:
       7.2.3.1. Base contingency plans and checklists implementation and execution effectiveness.
       7.2.3.2. Installation notification and warning system function and effectiveness.
       7.2.3.3. First Responder and Emergency Responder ability to detect, assess, contain, and recover
       from incidents.
       7.2.3.4. Recovery plan development and execution capability.
       7.2.3.5. Off-base interface with local responders and EOC.
       7.2.3.6. Ability to provide military assistance under imminently serious conditions.
       7.2.3.7. Ability to continue mission during and following a incident.
       7.2.3.8. Integrate periodic testing of the local weather watch or weather warning dissemination
       systems with installation EM activities and evaluate the timeliness of notification of personnel and
       response capability for on- and off-base agencies and GSUs. Include AFI 10-229 requirements.

7.3. Exercise Policy. Exercises should focus on competency of and compliance with the requirements
listed in the CEMP 10-2, AT Plan 31-101, MCRP, ESP, and Installation Deployment Plan. Exercises must
evaluate and reinforce the capabilities to meet those requirements. Exercise requirements are listed in
Table 7.1., Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Exercise Requirements – Installation Exer-
cises.
7.3. (WRIGHTPATTERSON) EET Team Chief will provide guidelines on ground rules, evaluation
areas, report formats, and grading criteria to subordinate units for Installation exercises IAW AFI 10-204.

      the AFMC Exercise Program immediately to include in the master Exercise and Related Activities
      Schedule.

7.7. Exercise Evaluation Team (EET) Training: The installation EET Chief is responsible for training
EET members with the EET Readiness Training Course, CD-ROM, MAJCOM-specific criteria, and
installation-specific criteria. The EET Chief will instruct this course and will utilize functional area
experts (Fire Fighters, Security Forces, Medical, Emergency Management, etc.) to instruct func-
tional-specific requirements to ensure a coordinated effort is achieved. If use of munitions is authorized
by the Installation Commander, the EET Chief will work with EOD, munitions, and Weapons Safety per-
sonnel to establish training for these munitions IAW AFMAN 91-201.
7.7. (AFMC) Exercise Evaluation Team (EET) Training. EET Chiefs will oversee IG and local exercise
munitions and simulator accounts.

                                                Chapter 8

                  CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT AND REPORT PROCEDURES

8.1. Purpose. This chapter establishes guidance for assessing and reporting Air Force EM capabilities on
a routine, pre-incident basis and reporting of actual response when incidents occur. Reporting is mandated
by AFI 10-201, AFI 10-204, and AFI 10-206. Some units use the AEF Reporting Tool (ART), following
guidance in AFI 10-244, Reporting Status of Aerospace Expeditionary Forces, to report Unit Type Code
(UTC) status reporting and AEF certification.

8.2. Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Capability Reports. The Installation Commander uses
monthly SORTS reports and annual Radiological Response Capability Reports to report the installation’s
overall capability to respond to the installation deployment mission or support a radiological response.
The commander must assess installation resources, augmenting resources, and critical capabilities avail-
able through MAAs or commercial sources. The combination of these resources should assist the installa-
tion in more closely achieving maximum response capability.
8.2. (AFMC) Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Capability Reports. AFMC installations will for-
ward EM program analysis data as required in Attachment 9 (Added).
8.2. (WRIGHTPATTERSON) Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Capability Reports. 88 ABW/
CECMX will serve as EM Metric coordinator.
   8.2.1. SORTS Reporting. Commanders at all levels must use measurement tools for assessing the
   strength and effectiveness of their EM program. Although SORTS reports are not EM-specific, the
   data needed to complete the SORTS reports make SORTS reporting a tool that can be used to support
   the Air Force EM program. SORTS reporting is based on continuous monitoring of changes in the
   overall unit level, resource category levels, and unit locations. Units must report no later than every 30
   days or when changes affect the unit’s overall rating. To obtain the resources necessary for successful
   mission accomplishment, personnel at every level must report the program status with specific justifi-
   cations. AFI 10-201 provides the requirements for reporting this information and further details.
   8.2.2. Radiological Response Capability Report.
       8.2.2.1. Installations will use Defense Special Weapons Agency (DSWA) 5100.52.1-L, Nuclear
       Accident Response Capability Listing, as the reference document to submit the annual report (DD
       Form 2325, Radiological Response Capability Report), with information current as of 1 Septem-
       ber of the current year. The annual report should arrive at the MAJCOM no later than 10 Septem-
       ber of the current year. Do not classify the report. Submit interim reports when a capability is
       substantially changed, such as an addition, deletion, or transfer of capability. Minor changes in
       quantities may be deferred until the annual update.
       8.2.2.1. (AFMC) Email or fax Radiological Response Capability Reports to HQ AFMC/A7OX at
       AFMC.A7OX.workflow@wpafb.af.mil or (937) 656-2949 (DSN is 986-2949). Include all base
       radiological capabilities in the report. HQ AFMC/A7OX will consolidate base inputs and forward
       to DTRA according to paragraph 8.2.2.2.
       8.2.2.1. (WRIGHTPATTERSON) 88 ABW/CECMX will be the office of primary responsibil-
       ity for development and coordination of the Radiological Response Capability Report (DD Form
       2325).
108                   AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008


         8.2.2.2. MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs will submit annual reports not later than 1 October of the
         current year to the Defense Threat Reduction Agency. To submit, send DD Forms 2325 directly to:
         Director, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, ATTN: Operations Center, 8725 John J. Kingman Rd
         Stop 6201, Ft. Belvoir VA 22060, or e-mail electronic copies to OPSCNTR1@DTRA.MIL, or
         facsimile (front and back of forms) to DSN 427-2094, commercial (703) 767-2094. A letter of
         transmittal or endorsement is not required. Additional information can be obtained by calling DSN
         427-2003, commercial (703) 767-2003.

8.3. Reports. The Installation Commander uses OPREP-3 and Situation Report (SITREP) reports to
report the installation’s overall EM response to incidents such as terrorist use of CBRNE and DSCA sup-
port. See AFI 10-206 for the required reporting procedures.
      8.3.1. Event/Incident Report (OPREP-3). OPREP-3 reports use command post channels to immedi-
      ately notify commanders of any event or incident that may attract international, national, US Air
      Force, or significant news media interest. Submit the OPREP-3 regardless of whether or not the event
      is being reported through other channels. AFI 10-206 details eight categories of OPREP-3 reports to
      help users determine the type of report to submit. CBRNE incidents, including HAZMAT releases, are
      reported using OPREP-3 reports.
      8.3.1. (AFMC) The REMF/REMO and 311 MSG/XPR will notify HQ AFMC/A7OX via email,
      phone message, or fax when responding to actual major accidents and natural disasters, and to
      off-base local exercises. Include in the message a short synopsis of the scenario, exercise time period,
      senior staff members involved, and contact information for on-scene POCs.
      8.3.2. Commander's SITREP. SITREP reports keep the Joint Staff, Services, and SecDef apprised of
      existing political, military, and operational situations and plans. SITREPS also advise commanders of
      a units ability to meet requirements outlined in approved plans. DSCA is reported through SITREP
      reports whether or not the support was covered by an MAA.

8.4. After-Action Reports. Procedures for after-actions reports are provided in AFI 10-204. Command-
ers must send an installation-wide lessons-learned report to their MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU for all emer-
gency responses. After-action reports should include actions implemented and any lessons learned during
actual incident response and exercises.
8.4. (AFMC) After-Action Reports. Installation Commanders will ensure all base agencies maintain
records of resources employed during disaster relief operations to prepare reimbursement requests. This
record will be maintained with the Events Log for future reference.
      8.4.1. Reports must be submitted within 14 days after the incident. The report must include dissemi-
      nation and notification successes and shortfalls, installation-wide response checklists, deficiencies,
      deficiency correction plans, required training, dates of implementation, or corrective action, follow-up
      actions, and lessons learned. See AFI 10-204 for guidance on reportable actions, as well as preparing,
      and submitting the report.
      8.4.2. After-action reports are also required by the Air Force After-Actions Reporting System
      (AFAARS) when Air Force elements participate in the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Exercise
      Program, other joint exercises, Air Force exercises, and real-world operations. AFAARS reporting is
      required on humanitarian, base closure, peacekeeping, and Noncombatant Evacuation Operations
AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008                                     109


  (NEO). Air Force, MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs must establish internal after-action reporting proce-
  dures that ensure AFAARS objectives are met, problems are solved and results are disseminated.

                                                  Chapter 9

      AIR FORCE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (EM) PROGRAM NOTIFICATION AND
                            WARNING SYSTEMS

9.1. Purpose. This chapter establishes policies for standardized signals and requirements for installation
notification and warning signals.

9.2. General Information. Every Air Force installation must have a rapid and effective system to dis-
seminate emergency information quickly. This includes signals or messaging appropriate to FPCONs,
watches, warnings, evacuation routes, and other alerting information to meet DOD and Federal warning
requirements. The installation should incorporate all available resources to provide warning, which may
include cable override, reverse 911, or Network Broadcast System. The incorporated resources compose
the Air Force Installation Notification and Warning System (INWS), as detailed in paragraph 9.3.
      9.2.1. Air Force Visual Aid (AFVA) 10-2510, USAF Emergency Notification Signals, and AFVA
      10-2511, USAF Standardized Attack Warning Signals for the United States, Its Territories and Posses-
      sions, provide standardized signals that must be used. These signals can be supplemented with signals
      compatible with local, national, host nation, or theater systems. Follow command and theater guid-
      ance when more than one system applies. Signals used within the United States, its territories, and
      possessions are compatible with those established by FEMA and the Homeland Security Advisory
      System.
      9.2.2. Display local visual aids or posters in work and rest areas. To incorporate local information, the
      overprint of AFVAs 10-2510 and 10-2511 is authorized.
      9.2.2. (WRIGHTPATTERSON) Unit EM Representatives will ensure that AFVA's 10-2510,WPAF-
      BVA’s 10-2 and 10-3 are displayed in work and rest areas. Representatives when possible will ensure
      that WPAFBVA 10-3 is displayed on all entrances to unit facilities to identify to incoming personnel
      the facility and base sector they are physically located in.
      9.2.3. Deployable units should consult plans for specific signals used at the deployed locations they
      support. For deployments to bare base locations, the communications unit must provide notification
      and warning systems.
      9.2.4. Consider unique populations, such as the visually or hearing impaired, to ensure effective
      warning systems are in place to provide for their safety. Planners also consider the environment in
      which the system operates and ensure that all personnel can immediately hear or see status changes
      and take action. For example, voice warnings must be audible to personnel inside facilities and over
      background noise such as air conditioning units. Use visual warnings when audio signals interfere
      with operational security.
      9.2.5. Use DOD-required individual building Mass Notification Systems (MNS) to disseminate EM
      information. MNS will be installed in most new and renovated buildings to meet DOD AT require-
      ments. Comply with DOD Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-010-01, DOD Minimum Antiterrorism
      Standards for Buildings and UFC 4-021-01, Design and O&M: Mass Notification Systems.

9.3. Installation Notification and Warning System (INWS). The INWS is a combination of methods
using audible and visual signals, verbal messages, and electronic communication. Communication modes
AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008                                               111


include sirens, horns, radio tone alerting, MNS, unaided voice systems, public and broadcast address sys-
tems, local area network messaging, telephone alert conferencing, pagers, television, radio, flags, signs,
and other electronic or mechanical methods. See UFC 4-021-01 for details about warning standards.
   9.3.1. CE and Communications Squadrons will design warning systems for operation throughout
   disaster conditions. The system must be redundant, hardened, or splinter-protected, and operate using
   both commercial and emergency power. Incorporate existing networks into this system.
   9.3.2. The INWS must:
       9.3.2.1. Provide installation-wide coverage of outdoor areas, indoor facilities, housing, and sepa-
       rated sites.
       9.3.2.2. Reach off-base facilities that are controlled or owned by the installation to ensure cover-
       age for personnel working or billeted in those areas.
       9.3.2.3. Incorporate DOD-required MNS into the indoor coverage.
           9.3.2.3.1. Design outdoor INWS voice signals to be intelligible to personnel.
           9.3.2.3.2. Consider the use of directional-type loudspeakers to minimize the distortion caused
           by overlapping voice signals.
       9.3.2.4. Incorporate systematic and coordinated standard to support the AFIMS, including proto-
       cols for:
           9.3.2.4.1. Initial and follow-on emergency responder and senior leader incident notification.
           9.3.2.4.2. Coordinated action for single or multiple incidents.
           9.3.2.4.3. Initiation of pre-planned and incident-specific actions by units, teams and individu-
           als, and off-base responders.
           9.3.2.4.4. Alert, notification, and warning of 100 percent of units and personnel and units
           under installation responsibility.
           9.3.2.4.5. Operating under differing FPCONs and Alarm Conditions.
           9.3.2.4.6. Integration of crisis and consequence management functions.
       9.3.2.5. Provide mechanisms for vertical and horizontal coordination, communications, and infor-
       mation sharing in response to threats or incidents.
   9.3.3. Domestic locations must use installation notification and warning systems that comply with
   DHS, FEMA, and National Weather Service’s Emergency Managers Weather Information Network
   and the Emergency Alerting System alerting methods, requirements, and capabilities. Off-base sys-
   tems are the responsibility of the city or county EM office.
   9.3.4. Foreign locations must use warning systems and signals that are compatible with local, host
   nation, or theater systems. Follow COCOM or DOS guidance when more than one notification and
   warning system may be applied or is in operation. Alert, notification, and warning methods must pro-
   vide both overt and covert notification capability. Warning systems in foreign countries should broad-
   cast voice messages in English and the predominant language of the local personnel working on base.

9.4. Installation Notification and Warning System (INWS) Responsibilities.
112                   AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008


      9.4.1. Installation Commander through the ICC. The Communications Squadron ensures installation,
      testing, activation, and maintenance are accomplished to ensure the installation populace can be
      warned of impending or occurring events. The ICC is responsible to activate and the CE Operations
      Flight is responsible for testing and maintaining individual building MNS when designated as real
      property installed equipment (RPIE). The owner or user must test, maintain, and activate systems that
      are not designated RPIE.
      9.4.2. The Installation Commander, incident commander, or other designated individual directs use of
      the system to ensure personnel safety.
      9.4.3. Command post personnel will test the INWS daily and weekly. They will also ensure a proce-
      dure is in place to verify each INWS location is operational. The command post will maintain a record
      of the test results. The methodology to verify the INWS can be heard at all locations outdoors on base
      must be coordinated between the command post, Communications Squadron, and the CE Squadron.
      This must be a locally developed procedure due to the differences in INWS systems and base topog-
      raphy.
      9.4.4. The Communications Squadron is responsible for coordinating new INWS requirements and
      tracking maintenance requirements on existing INWS components. The command post is responsible
      for identifying, reporting, and tracking INWS outages. The CE Operations Flight is responsible for
      maintaining existing power requirements. The Communications Squadron installs and maintains the
      INWS components that activate, generate, and transmit the INWS signal including speakers, sirens,
      and amplifiers. The CE Operations Flight installs and maintains individual building MNS when des-
      ignated as RPIE.

Terms
Air Force Career Field Managers (AFCFM)—Enlisted AFCFMs are typically CMSgts serving at
Headquarters Air Force who are responsible for organizing and managing one or more enlisted career
fields. Their responsibilities include establishing career field entry requirements, managing trained
personnel requirements and manning, as well as developing and managing career-long training plans'
requirements and programs.
Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program—The single, integrated Air Force program to
coordinate and organize efforts to prepare for, prevent, respond to, recover from, and mitigate the direct
and indirect consequences of an emergency or attack. The primary missions of the Air Force EM program
are to (1) save lives, (2) minimize the loss or degradation of resources, and (3) continue, sustain, and
restore combat and combat support operational capability in an all-hazards physical threat environment at
Air Force installations worldwide. The ancillary missions of the Air Force EM program are to support
homeland defense and civil support operations and to provide support to civil and host nation authorities
IAW DOD directives and through the appropriate Combatant Command. The Air Force EM program is
managed by the Office of The Civil Engineer, AF/A7C.
Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS)—A methodology designed to incorporate the
requirements of HSPD-5, the NIMS, the NRP, and OSD guidance while preserving the unique military
AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008                                                 127


requirements of the expeditionary Air Force. AFIMS provides the Air Force with an incident management
system that is consistent with the single, comprehensive approach to domestic incident management.
AFIMS provides the Air Force with the coordinating structures, processes, and protocols required to
integrate its specific authorities into the collective framework of Federal departments and agencies for
action to include mitigation, prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery activities. It includes a core
set of concepts, principles, terminology, and technologies covering the incident command system, EOCs,
incident command, training, identification and management of resources, qualification and certification,
and the collection, tracking and reporting of incident information and incident resources. The AFIMS
methodology is incorporated into current operating practices through revised instructions and manuals,
training products, and exercise and evaluation tools.
Antiterrorism (AT)—Defensive measures used to reduce the vulnerability of individuals and property to
terrorist acts, to include limited response and containment by local military and civilian forces. See also
AFI 10-245.
Area of Responsibility (AOR)—The geographical area associated with a COCOM within which a
combatant commander has authority to plan and conduct operations.
Avoidance—Individual and/or unit measures taken by individuals or units to avoid or minimize CBRN
attacks and reduce the effects of CBRN hazards.
Awareness—The continual process of collecting, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence, information,
and knowledge to allow organizations and individuals to anticipate requirements and to react effectively.
Bare Base—A base having minimum essential facilities to house, sustain, and support operations to
include, if required, a stabilized runway, taxiways, and aircraft parking areas. A bare base must have a
source of water that can be made potable. Other requirements to operate under bare base conditions form
a necessary part of the force package deployed to the bare base.
Biological Agent—A microorganism that causes disease in personnel, plants, or animals or causes the
deterioration of material.
Biological Threat—A threat that consists of biological material planned to be deployed to produce
casualties in personnel or animals or damage plants.
Biological Warfare (BW)—voluntary use of living organisms or their toxic products with the intent of
killing or harming persons, useful animals or plants.
Biological Weapon (BW)—An item of material that projects, disperses, or disseminates a biological
agent including arthropod vectors.
CBRN—Operations that include chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear, either individually or in
combination. Collectively known as WMD, CBRN replaces “NBC” when used in reference to operations
or incidents limited to NBC-only issues. TIC/TIM and HAZMAT are considered part of the “C” in
“CBRN.”
CBRNE—Operations or incidents involving chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield
explosives, either individually or in combination. “CBRNE” is used anytime that reference is not being
made to WMD operations or incidents.
CBRNE Environment—condition of warfare in which an adversary possesses or uses chemical,
biological, radiological, nuclear, or high-yield explosive weapons, by-products, infrastructure, and
associated delivery methods.
128                  AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008


CBRNE Hazard—Those CBRNE elements that pose or could pose a hazard to individuals. CBRNE
hazards include those created from accidental realizes, TIM (especially air and water poisons), biological
pathogens, radioactive matter, and high-yield explosives. Also included are any hazards resulting from the
deliberate employment of WMD during military operations.
CBRNE High Threat Area (HTA)—Friendly forces in these areas are at high risk for attack with
CBRNE weapons by states and non-state actors, such as terrorists and criminals also known as
transnationals. Potential adversaries within the region either possess or are likely to possess a substantial
stockpile of CBRNE weapons and weapons systems and may have special operations forces capable of
conducting sustained attacks on airbases. Actual or potential transnational threats exist during peacetime
or wartime. Forces are within immediate strike range of adversary theater missiles, and CBRNE strikes
using these weapons are assumed to be likely to occur. Air Force personnel and units in or deployed to
these locations will be organized, trained, exercised, and equipped to survive CBRNE attacks and conduct
sustained combat operations in CBRNE environments.
CBRNE Low Threat Area (LTA)—Friendly forces in these areas are at risk for attack with CBRNE
weapons by transnationals. Actual or potential transnational threats exist during peacetime or wartime.
Select personnel (see paragraphs 2.4.2.6. and 2.4.2.7.) and other personnel identified in CEMP 10-2 are
organized, trained, and equipped to continue critical missions and restore the primary mission. All other
personnel in these locations are trained to survive attacks.
CBRNE Medium Threat Area (MTA)—Friendly forces in these areas are at medium risk for attack
with CBRNE weapons by states and non-state actors, such as terrorists and criminals also known as
transnationals. Potential adversaries within the region either possess or are likely to possess CBRNE
weapons and weapons systems and may also have special operations forces capable of conducting limited
attacks on airbases. Actual or potential transnational threats exist during peacetime or wartime. Forces
may be within the extended range of adversary theater missiles, but it is assessed that CBRNE strikes
using these weapons are less likely to occur. Air Force personnel and units in or deployed to these
locations will be organized, trained, exercised, and equipped to survive CBRNE attacks and to conduct
limited combat operations in CBRNE environments.
Chemical Agent—Any toxic chemical intended for use in military operations.
Chemical Operations—Employment of chemical agents to kill, injure, or incapacitate for a significant
period of time, personnel or animals, and deny or hinder the use of areas, facilities or material; or defense
against employment of chemical agents.
Chemical Warfare (CW)—All aspects of military operations involving the employment of lethal and
incapacitating munitions or agents and the warning and protective measures associated with such
offensive operations. Because riot control agents and herbicides are not considered chemical warfare
agents, those two items will be referred to separately or under the broader term “chemical,” which will be
used to include all types of chemical munitions or agents collectively.
Chemical Weapon (CW)—Together or separately,
      a. a toxic chemical and its precursors, except when intended for a purpose not prohibited under the
         Chemical Weapons Convention;
      b. a munition or device specifically designed to cause death or other harm through toxic properties
         of those chemicals specified in (a) which would be released as a result of the employment of such
         munition or device;
AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008                                                129


   c. any equipment specifically designed for use directly in connection with the employment of muni-
      tions or devices specified in (b).
Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Operation—A collective term used only when referring to a
combined chemical, biological, and radiological operation.
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosive (CBRNE) Incident—A n
emergency resulting from the deliberate or unintentional, release of nuclear, biological, radiological, or
toxic or poisonous chemical materials, or the detonation of a high-yield explosive.
Civil Disturbance—Group acts of violence and disorder prejudicial to public law and order.
Cold Zone—This area contains the command post and such other support functions as are deemed
necessary to control the incident. The zone encompassing the warm zone used to carry out all other
support functions of the incident. Workers in the cold zone are not required to wear personal protective
clothing because the zone is considered safe. The MEOC, the IC staging area, and the triage or treatment
area are located within the cold zone.
Combating Terrorism—Actions, including AT (defensive measures taken to reduce vulnerability to
terrorist acts) and counterterrorism (offensive measures taken to prevent, deter, and respond to terrorism),
taken to oppose terrorism throughout the entire threat spectrum.
Command and Control (C2)—The exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated
commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission. C2 functions are
performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment, communications, facilities, and procedures
employed by a commander in planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling forces and operations in
the accomplishment of the mission.
Command Post (CP)—A unit or sub-unit’s headquarters where the commander and the staff perform
their activities. In combat, a unit or sub-unit’s headquarters is often divided into echelons.
Commander’s Senior Staff—A C2 function normally activated for a specific incident to oversee the
mission operation of the installation. The Commander’s Senior Staff is scalable to support the ICC and
coordinate with the EOC. (Note: Do not abbreviate as “CSS”.)
Common Operating Picture (COP)—A single identical display of relevant information shared by more
than one command. A COP facilitates collaborative planning and assists all echelons to achieve
situational awareness.
Confirmatory Identification—The determination of a CBRNE material or pathogen’s identity to the
specificity and confidence required to meet all objectives of the incident recovery.
Consequence Management (CM)—Actions taken to maintain or restore essential services and manage
and mitigate problems resulting from disasters and catastrophes, including natural, manmade, or terrorist
incidents.
Contamination—1. The deposit, absorption, or adsorption of radioactive material or of biological or
chemical agents on or by structures, areas, personnel, or objects, or in aerosolized clouds. 2. (DOD only)
Food or water made unfit for consumption by humans or animals because of the presence of
environmental chemicals, radioactive elements, bacteria, or organisms, the by-product of the growth of
bacteria or organisms, the decomposing material (to include the food substance itself) or waste in the food
or water.
130                 AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008


Contamination Control Area—A area in which contaminated IPE is removed; people, equipment, and
supplies are decontaminated to allow processing between a toxic environment and a toxic free area; the
last area an individual can safely don IPE before moving into a contaminated area.
Contamination Control Station—An area specifically designated for allowing ingress and egress of
personnel and equipment to or from the hazards area. The outer boundary of the CCS is the CCL, and the
inner boundary is the line segment labeled the hot line.
Contingency—An emergency involving military forces caused by natural disasters, terrorists,
subversives, or by required military operations. Due to the uncertainty of the situation, contingencies
require plans, rapid response and special procedures to ensure the safety and readiness of personnel,
installations, and equipment.
Contingency Operations Costs—These are the incremental costs that would not be incurred if the
contingency operation were not being carried out.
Continuity of Operations (COOP)—The degree or state of being continuous in the conduct of
functions, tasks, or duties necessary to accomplish a military action or mission in carrying out the national
military strategy. It includes the functions and duties of the commander as well as the supporting
functions and duties performed by the staff and others acting under the authority and direction of the
commander.
Control Zones—The areas at a HAZMAT incident that are designated based upon safety and the degree
of hazard.
Conventional Explosive Attack—Conventional explosives are compounds or mixtures (such as
ammonium nitrate, TNT, or plastic explosives) that create blast and cause fragmentation when detonated.
Military munitions and IEDs use conventional explosives. The vast majority of attacks involving
conventional explosives are simply conventional explosive attacks. “High-Yield Explosive” (HYE), is a
term used to further delineate conventional explosives and is defined by DOD as: any conventional
[explosive] weapon or device that is capable of a high order of destruction or disruption and/or of being
used in such a manner as to kill or injure large numbers of people. (HYE is the E in CBRNE.)." Note that
HYE is similar to the term “WMD” – it refers to a weapon or device, and the method in which it is used
so that it kills a large number of people. The key for HYE is how the device is constructed and employed.
For purposes of planning protective measures, the CJCS (CJCSI 3435.01) further clarified HYE as a
device or incident involving: (1) the use of a conventional explosive weapon in conjunction with a CBRN
component or (2) the terrorist use of a conventional weapon or explosive device in such a manner to
inflict a large number of casualties. Examples include a vehicle-borne IED parked adjacent to a hospital,
or an explosive device placed strategically on an aircraft. The term "explosive" or "conventional
explosive" includes the term "HYE" unless specifically noted.
Conventional Weapon—A weapon that is not chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear.
Cordon—A physical barrier surrounding the incident scene where controls are established to preclude
unauthorized entry.
Critical Infrastructures—Systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States
that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security,
national economic security, national public health or safety or any combination of those matters.

District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, US possessions, and territories or any political
subdivision thereof, as a result of enemy attack, insurrection, civil disturbance, earthquake, fire, flood, or
other public disasters or equivalent emergencies that endanger life and property or disrupt the usual
process of government. The term domestic emergency includes any or all of the emergency conditions
defined below:
   a. Civil defense emergency. A domestic emergency disaster situation resulting from devastation cre-
      ated by an enemy attack and requiring emergency operations during and following that attack. It
      may be proclaimed by appropriate authority in anticipation of an attack.
   b. Civil disturbances. Riots, acts of violence, insurrections, unlawful obstructions or assemblages, or
      other disorders prejudicial to public law and order. The term civil disturbance includes all domes-
      tic conditions requiring or likely to require the use of Federal Armed Forces pursuant to the provi-
      sions of Chapter 15 of Title 10, USC.
   c. Major disaster. Any flood, fire, hurricane, tornado, earthquake, or other catastrophe which, in the
      determination of the President, is or threatens to be of sufficient severity and magnitude to war-
      rant disaster assistance by the Federal Government under Public Law 606, 91st Congress (42 USC

      d. Natural disaster. All domestic emergencies except those created as a result of enemy attack or
         civil disturbance.
Emergency Decontamination—The physical process of immediately reducing contamination of
individuals in potentially life-threatening situations with or without the formal establishment of a
decontamination corridor. (NFPA 471) Note: The EPA does not require runoff control when a process is
used to save lives or reduce injury.
Emergency Operations Center (EOC)—For the purposes of AFIMS, the EOC is the C2 support
elements that directs, monitors, and supports the installation’s actions before, during, and after an
incident. The EOC is activated and recalled as necessary by the Installation Commander. The EOC
updates the ICC with ongoing incident status and seeks support through the ICC when on-scene
requirements surpass the installation’s inherent capability and the installation’s cumulative capabilities
acquired through MAAs. EOCs may also support MCS and joint information activities. According to the
NRP, the EOC is defined as “The physical location at which the coordination of information and resources
to support attack response and incident management activities normally takes place. An EOC may be a
temporary facility or may be located in a more central or permanently established facility, perhaps at a
higher level of organization within a jurisdiction. EOCs may be organized by major functional disciplines
such as fire, law enforcement, and medical services, by jurisdiction such as Federal, State, regional,
county, city, tribal, or by some combination thereof.”
Emergency Responders—The response element of a DRF that deploy to the accident scene after the
First Responders to expand C2 and perform support functions. Emergency Responders include follow-on
elements such as firefighters, law enforcement personnel, security personnel, and emergency medical
technicians, as well as CE Readiness personnel, EOD personnel, physicians, nurses, medical treatment
providers at medical treatment facilities, readiness officers, public health officers, bioenvironmental
engineering personnel, and mortuary affairs personnel. Emergency Responders also include specialized
teams such as the RST or SMT. Not all Emergency Responders are First Responders, but all First
Responders are Emergency Responders. Emergency Responders are not assigned to additional duties that
will conflict with their emergency duties. For the purposes of AFIMS, EOD personnel are considered
Emergency Responders but not First Responders.
Emergency Support Function (ESF)—ESFs are groupings of capabilities into an organizational
structure that provides the support, resources, program implementation, and services that are most likely
to be needed during an incident. ESFs also serve as the primary operational-level mechanism that
provides support during an incident.
Evacuation—1. The process of moving any person who is wounded, injured, or ill to and/or between
medical treatment facilities. 2. The clearance of personnel, animals, or materiel from a given locality. 3.
The controlled process of collecting, classifying, and shipping unserviceable or abandoned materiel, US
or foreign, to appropriate reclamation, maintenance, technical intelligence, or disposal facilities. 4. The
ordered or authorized departure of noncombatants from a specific area by Department of State, DOD, or
appropriate military commander. This refers to the movement from one area to another in the same or
different countries. The evacuation is caused by unusual or emergency circumstances and applies equally
to command or non-command sponsored family members.
Expeditionary Operation—An expeditionary operation is a military operation conducted by an armed
force to accomplish a specific objective in a foreign country. The missions of military expeditions may
vary widely. Examples of missions of military expeditions include providing humanitarian assistance in
AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008                                                133


times of disaster or disruption; establishing and keeping peace in a foreign country; protecting US citizens
or commerce abroad; retaliating for an act of aggression by a foreign political group; and destroying an
enemy government by defeating its armed forces in combat.
Expeditionary Units—These designated units are formed to conduct a specific mission of limited
duration in support of a combatant commander requirement. Because a standing wing, group, or squadron
does not normally deploy intact, UTCs from multiple units are deployed to create an expeditionary unit.
Explosive Ordnance—All munitions containing explosives, nuclear fission or fusion materials, and
biological and chemical agents. This includes bombs and warheads; guided and ballistic missiles;
artillery, mortar, rocket, and small arms ammunition; all mines, torpedoes and depth charges; demolition
charges; pyrotechnics; clusters and dispensers; cartridge and propellant actuated devices;
electro-explosive devices; clandestine and IEDs; and all similar or related items or components explosive
in nature.
Facility—A real property entity consisting of one or more of the following: a building, a structure, a
utility system, pavement, and underlying land.
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)—The Federal agency tasked to establish Federal
policies for and coordinate civil defense and civil emergency planning, management, mitigation, and
assistance functions of Executive agencies.
First Receivers—Healthcare workers at a medical facility that may receive contaminated victims for
treatment.
First Responders—The DRF elements that deploys immediately to the disaster scene to provide initial
C2, to save lives, and to suppress and control hazards. Firefighters, law enforcement security personnel
and key medical personnel provide the initial, immediate response to a CBRNE incident. All First
Responders are Emergency Responders, but not all Emergency Responders are First Responders. First
Responders are not assigned as augmentees or to additional duties that will conflict with their emergency
duties.
Force Protection (FP)—Actions taken to prevent or mitigate hostile actions against Department of
Defense personnel (to include family members), resources, facilities, and critical information. These
actions conserve the force’s fighting potential so it can be applied at the decisive time and place and
incorporate the coordinated and synchronized offensive and defensive measures to enable the effective
employment of the joint force while degrading opportunities for the enemy. Force protection does not
include actions to defeat the enemy or protect against accidents, weather, or disease. Also called FP. (JP
1-02) [An integrated application of offensive and defensive actions that deter, detect, pre-empt, mitigate,
or negate threats against or hazards to Air Force air and space operations and assets, based on an
acceptable level of risk.](Definition in brackets applies only to the Air Force and is offered for clarity.)
See also AFI 10-245.
Functional Area Analysis (FAA)—The FAA identifies the operational tasks, conditions, and standards
needed to achieve military objectives. It uses the national strategies, the Family of Joint Future Concepts,
UCP-assigned missions, CONOPS, joint tasks, the capabilities list (e.g., Universal Joint Task List), the
anticipated range of broad capabilities that an adversary might employ and other sources as input. The
FAA identifies the scenarios against which the capabilities and attributes will be assessed. Scenario
sources include, but are not limited to, the Defense Planning Scenarios (DPS) published by the Office of
the Secretary of Defense (OSD). The FAA produces a prioritized list of capabilities and tasks across all
functional areas necessary to achieve the military objectives. The capabilities and their attributes should
134                 AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008


be traceable to the Family of Joint Future Concepts and any other supporting information used to develop
the capabilities. These capabilities form the basis for integrated architectures and will be reviewed in the
follow-on functional needs analysis (FNA).
Functional Needs Analysis (FNA)—The FNA assesses the ability of the current and programmed
warfighting systems to deliver the capabilities the FAA identified under the full range of operating
conditions and to the designated measures of effectiveness. Using the capabilities and tasks identified in
the FAA as primary input, the FNA produces a list of capability gaps that require solutions and indicates
the time frame in which those solutions are needed. It may also identify redundancies in capabilities that
reflect inefficiencies. The FNA will also provide the relative priority of the gaps identified. The FNA
serves to further define and refine the integrated architectures. The FNA must assess the entire range of
doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities and policy, as
an inherent part of defining capability needs.
Gross Decontamination—(Also known as Hasty or Expedient decontamination.) The start of the
decontamination process during which the amount of surface contaminants is significantly reduced. Note:
This process typically includes as a minimum completely flushing with water and the removal of most or
all of a person’s clothing while continuing to flush. When warranted, decontamination soap or other
products may be provided. The EPA does not require runoff control when this decontamination process is
used to save lives or reduce injury.
Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT)—Any material that is flammable, corrosive, an oxidizing agent,
explosive, toxic, poisonous, etiological, radioactive, nuclear, unduly magnetic, a chemical agent,
biological research material, compressed gases, or any other material that, because of its quantity,
properties, or packaging, may endanger life or property.

destruction or disruption or of being used to kill or injure large numbers of people.
Homeland Defense—The protection of United States sovereignty, territory, domestic population, and
critical infrastructure against external threats and aggression or other threats as directed by the President.
The Department of Defense is responsible for homeland defense. Homeland defense includes missions
such as domestic air defense. The Department recognizes that threats planned or inspired by “external”
actors may materialize internally. The reference to “external threats” does not limit where or how attacks
could be planned and executed. The Department is prepared to conduct homeland defense missions
whenever the President, exercising his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief, authorizes
military actions.
Homeland Security Presidential Directive-5 (HSPD-5)—A Presidential directive issued on February
28, 2003 and intended to enhance the ability of the United States to manage domestic incidents by
establishing a single, comprehensive National Incident Management System (NIMS).
Homeland Security—Homeland security, as defined in the National Strategy for Homeland Security, is a
concerted national effort to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, reduce America’s
vulnerability to terrorism, and minimize the damage and recover from attacks that do occur. The
AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008                                                  135

NATO organizations to be located on, to operate in, or to transit through its territory.
Hot Zone—The area immediately surrounding a HAZMAT incident, extending far enough to prevent
adverse effects from HAZMAT releases to personnel outside the zone.
Identification—In CBRNE operations, the determination of which CBRNE material or pathogen is
present.
Incident Commander (IC)—The command function is directed by the IC, who is the person in charge at
the incident and who must be fully qualified to manage the response. Major responsibilities for the IC
include: performing command activities, such as establishing command; protecting life and property;
controlling personnel and equipment resources; maintaining accountability for responder and public
safety, as well as for task accomplishment; and establishing and maintaining an effective liaison with
outside agencies and organizations, including the EOC when it is activated.
Incident Command System (ICS)—ICS is the model tool for command, control, and coordination of a
response and provides a means to coordinate the efforts of individual agencies as they work toward the
common goal of stabilizing the incident and protecting life, property, and the environment. ICS uses
principles that have been proven to improve efficiency and effectiveness in a business setting and applies
the principles to emergency response.
Incident—An occurrence or event, natural or human caused, that requires an emergency response to
protect life or property. Incidents can, for example, include major disasters, emergencies, terrorist attacks,
terrorist threats, wildland and urban fires, floods, HAZMAT spills, nuclear accidents, aircraft accidents,
earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms, war-related disasters, public health and medical
emergencies, and other occurrences requiring an emergency response.
Incidents of National Significance—An actual or potential high-impact event that requires a
coordinated and effective response by an appropriate combination of Federal, State, local, tribal,
nongovernmental, or private-sector entities to save lives and minimize damage and provide the basis for
long-term community recovery and mitigation activities.
Individual Protection—Actions taken by individuals to survive and continue the mission under nuclear,
biological, and chemical conditions.
Individual Protective Equipment (IPE)—In nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare, the personal
clothing and equipment required to protect an individual from biological and chemical hazards and some
nuclear effects.
Initial Actions—The actions taken by those responders who are first to arrive at an incident site.
Initial Detection—Procedures performed by emergency responders to determine the presence of
HAZMAT. Initial detection is a field test using detection equipment to provide a reasonable basis for
acceptance of the presence of hazards.
Initial Isolation Zone—This defines an area surrounding the incident in which persons may be exposed
to dangerous upwind and life-threatening downwind concentrations of material.
Initial Response—Resources initially committed to an incident.

for each emergency planning district to plan and coordinate local emergency response actions.
Low Threat Area (LTA)—See CBRNE Low Threat Area.
Major Accident—An accident involving DOD materiel or DOD activities that is serious enough to
warrant response by the installation DRF. It differs from the minor day-to-day emergencies and incidents
that installation agencies typically handle.
Major Disaster—As defined by the Stafford Act, any natural catastrophe (including any hurricane,
tornado, storm, high water, wind-driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption,
landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, or drought) or, regardless of cause, any fire, flood or explosion, in any
part of the United States, which in the determination of the President causes damage of sufficient severity
and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance under this act to supplement the efforts and available
resources of States, local governments, and disaster relief organizations in alleviating the damage, loss,
hardship, or suffering caused thereby.
Mass Decontamination—(or, Mass Casualty Decontamination) The physical process of rapidly reducing
or removing contaminants from multiple persons (victims and responders) in potentially life-threatening
situations with or without the formal establishment of a decontamination corridor. Note: The EPA does
not require runoff control when this process is used to save lives or reduce injury.
Medium Threat Area (MTA)—See CBRNE Medium Threat Area.
Mission-Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP)—A flexible system of protection against nuclear,
biological, and chemical contamination. This posture requires personnel to wear only that protective
clothing and MOPP equipment appropriate to the threat level, work rate imposed by the mission,
temperature, and humidity.
Mitigation—Activities designed to reduce or eliminate risks to persons or property or to lessen the actual
or potential effects or consequences of an incident. Mitigation measures may be implemented prior to,
during, or after an incident. Mitigation measures are often developed IAW lessons learned from prior
AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008                                                137


incidents. Mitigation involves ongoing actions to reduce exposure to, probability of, or potential loss from
hazards. Measures may include zoning and building codes, flood plain buyouts, and analysis of
hazard-related data to determine where it is safe to build or locate temporary facilities. Mitigation can
include efforts to educate governments, businesses, and the public on measures they can take to reduce
loss and injury.
Monitoring—The process of sampling over time to identify changes in conditions.
Mutual Aid Agreement (MAA)—Written agreement between agencies, organizations, or jurisdictions
that they will assist one another on request by furnishing personnel, equipment, or expertise in a specified
manner. Reciprocal assistance by local government and an installation for emergency services under a
prearranged plan. Mutual aid is synonymous with “mutual assistance,” “outside aid,” “memorandums of
understanding,” “memorandums of agreement,” “letters of agreement,” “cooperative assistant
agreement,” “intergovernmental compacts,” or other similar agreements, written or verbal, that constitute
an agreed reciprocal assistance plan for sharing emergency services. MAAs between entities are an
effective means to obtain resources and should be developed whenever possible. MAAs should be in
writing, be reviewed by legal counsel, and be signed by a responsible official.
Mutual Support—That support which units render each other against any enemy because of their
assigned tasks, their position relative to each other and to the enemy and their inherent capabilities.
National Defense Area (NDA)—An area established on non-Federal lands located within the United
States, its possessions, or territories for the purpose of safeguarding classified defense information or
protecting DOD equipment or material. Establishment of an NDA temporarily places such non-Federal
lands under the effective control of the DOD and results only from an emergency event. The senior DOD
representative at the scene will define the boundary, mark it with a physical barrier, and post warning
signs. The landowner’s consent and cooperation will be obtained whenever possible; however, military
necessity will dictate the final decision regarding location, shape, and size of the NDA.
National Disaster Medical System (NDMS)—The NDMS is an integrated Federal, State, local, and
private sector medical response system for medical support during wartime or major United States
domestic disasters. NDMS provides DOD with medical care resources from the civilian sector to back up
the Veterans Administration and DOD medical contingency arrangement.
National Emergency—A condition declared by the President or Congress by virtue of powers previously
vested in them that authorize certain emergency actions to be undertaken in the national interest. Action
to be taken may include partial, full, or total mobilization of national resources.
National Incident Management System (NIMS)—A system mandated by HSPD-5 that provides a
consistent, nationwide approach for Federal, State, local, and tribal governments; the private sector; and
nongovernmental organizations to work effectively and efficiently together to prepare for, respond to, and
recover from domestic incidents, regardless of cause, size, or complexity. To provide for interoperability
and compatibility among Federal, State, local, and tribal capabilities, the NIMS includes a core set of
concepts, principles, and terminology. HSPD-5 identifies these as the ICS; multiagency coordination
systems; training; identification, and management of resources (including systems for classifying types of
resources); qualification and certification; and the collection, tracking, and reporting of incident
information and incident resources.
National Response System (NRS)—Pursuant to the National Contingency Plan, the mechanism for
coordinating response actions by all levels of government for oil and hazardous substances spills and
releases.

environments where OSHA or applicable AFOSH standards apply, including emergency response to
CBRNE incidents in the United States.
Point Detection—The use of detection equipment to evaluate suspicious material at a particular point.
Preparedness—The range of deliberate, critical tasks and activities necessary to build, sustain, and
improve the operational capability to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from domestic
incidents. Preparedness is a continuous process involving efforts at all levels of government and between
government and private-sector and nongovernmental organizations to identify threats, determine
vulnerabilities, and identify required resources.
Presumptive Identification—The tentative determination of a CBRNE material or pathogen’s identity
with sufficient specificity and confidence to make expedient, risk-based control decisions until
confirmatory identification can be completed.
Prevention—Actions to avoid an incident or to intervene to stop an incident from occurring. Prevention
involves actions to protect lives and property. It involves applying intelligence and other information to a
range of activities that may include such countermeasures as deterrence operations; heightened
inspections; improved surveillance and security operations; investigations to determine the full nature and
source of the threat; public health and agricultural surveillance and testing processes; immunizations,
isolation or quarantine; and, as appropriate, specific law enforcement operations aimed at deterring,
preempting, interdicting or disrupting illegal activity and apprehending potential perpetrators and
bringing them to justice.
AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008                                                 139

persons; implement additional measures for community restoration; incorporate mitigation measures and
techniques, as feasible; evaluate the incident to identify lessons learned; and develop initiatives to
mitigate the effects of future incidents.
Regional Response Teams (RRT)—Regional counterparts to the National Response Team, the RRTs
comprise regional representatives of the Federal agencies on the NRT and representatives of each State
within the region. The RRTs serve as planning and preparedness bodies before a response and provide
coordination and advice to the Federal IC during response actions.
Response—Activities that address the short-term, direct effects of an incident. Response includes
immediate actions to save lives, protect property, and meet basic human needs. Response also includes the
execution of emergency operations plans and of incident mitigation activities designed to limit the loss of
life, personal injury, property damage, and other unfavorable outcomes. As indicated by the situation,
response activities include: applying intelligence and other information to lessen the effects or
consequences of an incident; increased security operations; continuing investigations into the nature and

140                 AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008


Response Task Force (RTF)—A DOD response force appropriately staffed, trained, and equipped to
coordinate actions necessary to control and recover from a radiological accident. The specific purpose of
the RTF is to recover weapons and provide radiological accident assistance. RTFs are organized and
maintained by those Combatant Commanders whose Component Commands have custody of nuclear
weapons or radioactive nuclear weapon components. RTFs are not structured to respond to terrorist use of
CBRNE or radiological dirty bombs. HQ ACC, HQ USAFE, and HQ AFSPC maintain MAJCOM RTFs
for specific roles and responsibilities. See paragraphs 3.7.1. and 3.7.7.

Specialized Teams—The teams formed from the existing installation and unit personnel resources to
support emergency response operations. For the purposes of this AFI, emergency response support teams
that are part of the DRF include the RST, SMTs, CCTs, and PAR teams. Other teams that support
emergency response, but have functional responsibilities beyond emergency response, are not considered
part of the DRF. Examples of such teams are Search and Recovery or Crash Recovery.
Standardization Agreement (STANAG)—The record of an agreement among several or all of the
member nations to adopt like or similar military equipment, ammunition, supplies and stores, and
operational, logistic and administrative procedures. National acceptance of a NATO allied publication
issued by the Military Agency for Standardization may be recorded as a STANAG.
Status-of-Forces Agreement (SOFA)—An agreement which defines the legal position of a visiting
military force deployed in the territory of a friendly state. Agreements delineating the status of visiting
military forces may be bilateral or multilateral. Provisions pertaining to the status of visiting forces may
be set forth in a separate agreement or they may form a part of a more comprehensive agreement. These
provisions describe how the authorities of a visiting force may control members of that force and the
amenability of the force or its members to the local law or to the authority of local officials. To the extent
that agreements delineate matters affecting the relations between a military force and civilian authorities
and population, they may be considered as civil affairs agreements.
Straight-line Wind—Generally, any wind that is not associated with rotation, used mainly to
differentiate them from tornadic winds. The National Weather Service defines a strong straight-line wind
as a wind of 50 knots or higher. Also called a derecho.
Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA)—This law required, among other things,
the local emergency response planning efforts in every State through its Title III “Emergency Planning
and Community Right to Know Act” of SARA.
Technical Decontamination—(also known as thorough or nine-step process decontamination) The
physical or chemical process of deliberate decontamination to achieve a thorough cleansing and removal

of contaminants from personnel and equipment. Note: Unlike decontamination, EPA requires run-off
control for this type of process.
Threat—An indication of possible violence, harm, or danger.
Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TIC)—Any chemicals manufactured, used, transported, or stored by
industrial, medical, or commercial processes. For example: pesticides, petrochemicals, fertilizers,
corrosives, or poisons.
Toxic Industrial Materials (TIM)—All toxic industrial materials (TIMs) manufactured, stored,
transported, used in industrial or commercial processes. It includes toxic industrial chemicals, toxic
industrial radiologicals, and toxic industrial biologicals. TIMs produce toxic impacts to personnel,
materials, and infrastructure.
Unexploded Ordnance (UXO)—Explosive ordnance that has been primed, fused, armed or otherwise
prepared for action and then fired, dropped, launched, projected, or placed in such a manner as to
constitute a hazard to operations, installations, personnel, or material, and remains unexploded either by
malfunction or design or for any other cause.
Vulnerability Assessment—A DOD, command or unit-level evaluation (assessment) to determine the
vulnerability to terrorist attack of an installation, unit, exercise, port, ship, residence, facility, or other site.
Identifies areas of improvement to withstand, mitigate, or deter acts of violence or terrorism.
Vulnerability—
    a. The susceptibility of a nation or military force to any action by any means through which its war
       potential or combat effectiveness may be reduced or its will to fight diminished.
    b. The characteristics of a system that cause it to suffer a definite degradation (incapability to per-
       form the designated mission) as a result of having been subjected to a certain level of effects in an
       unnatural (manmade) hostile environment.
    c. In information operations, a weakness in information system security design, procedures, imple-
       mentation, or internal controls that could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to information
       systems.
Warm Zone—The area where personnel and equipment decontamination and hot zone support take
place. It includes control points for the access corridor and thus assists in reducing the spread of
contamination.
Water Vulnerability Assessment (WVA)—A method that provides a tool to understand the risk of
operations and pinpoint areas where security improvements might reduce risk. The assessments focus on
the effectiveness of existing countermeasures, mitigation, and recovery capabilities.
Weapon of Mass Destruction (WMD)—Weapons that are capable of a high order of destruction or of
being used in such a manner as to destroy large numbers of people. WMD can be high explosives or
nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological weapons, but exclude the means of transporting or
propelling the weapon where such means is a separable and divisible part of the weapon.
WMD Civil Support Team (or National Guard Civil Support Team)—DOD has maintained full-time
Guard forces in Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams that are dedicated to homeland
security missions. These teams are comprised of 22 full-time personnel and are maintained at the highest
readiness levels and can respond rapidly to support civil authorities in an event involving a weapon of
142                AFI10-2501_AFMCSUP_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 26 MARCH 2008


mass destruction. Their role is to assist local officials in determining the nature of the attack, provide
medical and technical advice and help to identify follow-on Federal and State assets that might be needed.
Congress has authorized at least one team for each State and territory. These teams are Federally funded
and trained but perform their mission under the command and control of the State governor.

                          EMERGENCY SUPPORT FUNCTIONS (ESF)

A2.1. ESFs are groupings of capabilities that provides the support, resources, program implementation,
and services that are most likely to be needed during emergency response. ESFs serve as the primary
operational-level mechanism that provides support during an incident. These ESFs are modified from the
NIMS/NRP construct to implement AFIMS. AFIMS specifies that all phases of incident management will
be the same regardless of the type of incident; therefore, no unique wartime ESFs exist. See Table A2.1.
Emergency Support Functions – Scope, Offices of Primary Responsibility (OPR) and Offices of Collat-
eral Responsibility (OCR).

A2.2. Each ESF has an OPR and one or more OCRs. The OPR for each ESF is identified on the basis of
authorities, resources, and capabilities. The OCRs provide additional capabilities within each ESF. More
detailed guidance will be contained in AFMAN 10-2502. Depending upon the scope and magnitude of the
incident, the ICC and EOC activate the appropriate ESFs to mobilize assets and deploy resources to sup-
port the incident. ESFs are expected to support one another in carrying out their respective roles and
responsibilities. OPRs and OCRs should use the requirements of this AFI and the CEMP 10-2 to carry out
their responsibilities.
NOTE: OPRs are not functionally responsible for all specified ESF tasks, but will coordinate the efforts
of the OCRs in support of any given activity within the scope of that ESF. See Table A2.2. Emergency
Support Functions – OCRs Matrixed by Functional Alignment.

CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, NUCLEAR, AND HIGH-YIELD EXPLOSIVE
            (CBRNE) INCIDENT SITE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
This attachment provides specific functional responsibilities for an integrated CBRNE Response Pro-
gram. These roles and responsibilities apply to terrorist use of CBRNE, CBRNE attack, peacetime inci-
dents involving CBRN, and naturally occurring disease outbreaks.

Table A3.1. Assumptions.
1.     “CBRNE Incident” includes the full spectrum of hazards, from industrial accidents to terrorist
       and enemy combatant attacks. In the early stages of CBRN incidents, the type of
       incident--accident, terrorist attack, or enemy combatant attack--may be unknown.
2.     Roles and responsibilities listed in this attachment apply to terrorist use of WMD, CBRNE attack,
       and peacetime incidents involving CBRNE.
3.     Home station and expeditionary roles, responsibilities, and basic capabilities should be seamless
       whenever possible to maximize proficiency in the CBRN response mission.
4.     First Responders and Emergency Responders need HAZMAT training and certification
       commensurate with their roles and responsibilities to comply with domestic requirements. These
       requirements are outlined in Chapter 6, Attachment 5 and Attachment 6.
5.     Training and equipment gaps between current capabilities and capabilities outlined in this
       instruction will be identified to MAJCOMs for oversight and resolution.
6.     The CE Environmental Officer is OPR for HAZMAT cleanup and site restoration operations in
       CBRN hazard environments. Incident site control will not be transferred to cleanup and
       restoration operations until adequate capability is in place for safe and healthy operations.
7.     Roles and responsibilities outlined in the following tables represent tasks performed in support of
       the IC through any designated OPR agency.
8.     All responders will be trained that a CBRN incident site may be a crime scene. Scene
       preservation, evidence handling, and chain of custody procedures will be included in training,
       evaluation, planning, response, and recovery.
9.     There is no single OPR for monitoring operations.

This attachment provides specific functional responsibilities for an 88 ABW integrated CBRNE Response
Program. These roles and responsibilities apply to terrorist use of CBRNE, CBRNE attack, and peacetime
incidents involving CBRN.

Table A3.1. (WRIGHTPATTERSON) (WPAFB) Assumptions.
  1    “CBRNE Incident” includes the full spectrum of hazards, from industrial accidents to terrorist
       and enemy combatant attacks. In the early stages of CBRN incidents, the type of
       incident--accident, terrorist attack, or enemy combatant attack--may be unknown.
  2    Roles and responsibilities listed in this attachment apply to terrorist use of WMD, CBRNE attack,
       and peacetime incidents involving CBRNE.
  3    CONUS or OCONUS home station and expeditionary roles, responsibilities, and basic
       capabilities should be seamless whenever possible to maximize proficiency in the CBRN
       response mission.
  4    First Responders and Emergency Responders need HAZMAT training and certification
       commensurate with their roles and responsibilities to comply with CONUS requirements. These
       requirements are outlined in Chapter 6, Attachment 5 and Attachment 6.
  5    Training and equipment gaps between current capabilities and capabilities outlined in this
       instruction will be identified to MAJCOMs for oversight and resolution.
  6    The CE Environmental Officer is OPR for HAZMAT cleanup and site restoration operations in
       CBRN hazard environments. Incident site control will not be transferred to cleanup and
       restoration operations until adequate capability is in place for safe and healthy operations.
  7    Roles and responsibilities outlined in the following tables represent tasks performed in support of
       the IC through any designated OPR agency.
  8    All responders will be trained that a CBRN incident site may be a crime scene. Scene
       preservation, evidence handling, and chain of custody procedures will be included in training,
       evaluation, planning, response, and recovery.
  9    There is no single OPR for monitoring operations.

AIR FORCE MEDICAL SERVICE (AFMS) RESPONSE TEAMS HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
                         (HAZMAT) TRAINING.

A6.1. Medical First Responders and Emergency Responders: The Initial Response Team is the only
first response team in the medical unit. Medical Emergency Responders could include the following
teams: Field Treatment, BEE, and PH. The level of training provided to these teams depends upon the
operations performed by the teams. For those teams that enter the hot or warm zone (requiring PPE and
potential exposure to contamination) First Responder Operations Level training is required. For those
teams that do not enter a hot or warm zone, First Responder Awareness Level training is required.

A6.2. First Receiver Training: First receivers typically include the following personnel: clinicians and
other medical staff who have a role in receiving and treating contaminated victims at the MTF such as
MTF triage personnel, personnel conducting patient decontamination, the Patient Administration Team,
and the Medical Security team. Training for medical first receivers is divided into training for those per-
sonnel who can be expected to work in the MTF Decontamination Zone and those who work near but not
in the MTF Decontamination Zone. Those medical first receivers working in the MTF Decontamination
Zone will receive First Responder Operations Level training. Other first receivers working outside the
MTF Decontamination Zone will receive First Responder Awareness Level training.

A6.3. First Responder Awareness Level Training:
      A6.3.1. Initial First Responder Awareness Level Training must be accomplished through one of the
      following methods:
         A6.3.1.1. Attending the 8-hour Awareness Level course conducted by CE.
         A6.3.1.2. Obtaining reciprocity from CE for completing Awareness Level training at another
         venue.
         A6.3.1.3. Completing the multimedia (CD-ROM) training course.
         A6.3.1.4. Challenge testing for those who have previously completed Awareness Level training.
         This testing will be conducted by CE Readiness.
      A6.3.2. First Responder Awareness Level Refresher Training may be accomplished by attending a
      formal refresher course, taking the multimedia (CD-ROM) training, or attending an in-service training
      course that meets the refresher training objectives. In addition, demonstration of competency during

 AFMC HEADQUARTERS AND INSTALLATION CORPORATE READINESS STRUCTURE
                               (CRS)
A8.1. (Added-AFMC) The AFMC CRS is a multi-tiered structure with input and support from AFMC
Headquarter directorates and Installation Readiness Boards (IRBds). The CRS brings all essential partic-
ipants together in a unified structure for integration, coordination and decision-making guidance on AF
and AFMC readiness, contingency, and EM issues. Outlined below is AFMC Headquarters and installa-
tion-level CRS processes.

A8.2. (Added-AFMC) AFMC Headquarter CRS (Figure A8.1. (Added)). The AFMC Headquarter CRS
is made up of three major components: Readiness Council (RC), Readiness Board (RB), and Working
Groups (WGs). The RC is the executive advisory committee responsible for readiness and contingency
functions using Command definitive guidance to formulate policy decisions and recommendations. The
RC complements but does not supersede staff responsibilities to develop and execute appropriate actions
within their functional areas. The RB introduces, reviews, debates, validates, resolves and prioritizes cor-
porate readiness-related programs and requirements. The WGs are action forums that research and recom-
mend positions on readiness and contingency planning, training, equipment issues; Air and Space
Expeditionary Force (AEF) manning and employment concepts; exercises, wargames, experiments, and
evaluations; acquisition and system integration techniques and other related tasks as required. HQ AFMC/
A7OX manages the AFMC CRS Webspace, available at https://www.afmc-mil.wpafb.af.mil/
HQ-AFMC/CC/programs/crs/. Located at the webspace is AFMC Headquarter CRS briefings, minutes,
charters, and other pertinent details.

      decisions and recommendations.
      A8.2.1.2. (Added-AFMC) The RC receives and passes theater readiness and contingency issues,
      reviews RB findings, status briefings and recommendations for AFMC CC/CV and Air Staff
      approval, and transfers them to the functional staff for implementation. The RC complements staff
      responsibilities to develop and execute appropriate actions within their functional areas. Normally,
      decisions and recommendations are determined by polling the members (Table A8.1. (Added)),

A9.1. (Added-AFMC) (Added) EM analysis helps focus AFMC installations and headquarters staff on
EM-related issues and capture critical data points, increasing awareness and establishing priorities. The
purpose of the EM Analysis Template (Figure A9.1. (Added)) provides AFMC senior staff and function-
als a snapshot of the installation EM program throughout the command. Each AFMC installation will col-
lect EM data and forward a consolidated metric to HQ AFMC/A7OX quarterly.

A9.3. (Added-AFMC) Assessment Areas. There are five assessment areas to formulate the installation
EM Analysis Template: Training, Equipment, Exercises, Planning, and Commander’s Overall Assess-
ment.
   A9.3.1. (Added-AFMC) Training. AFI 10-2501, Table 6.1., Major Accident and CBRNE Response
   Education and Training, Table 6.2., Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Minimum Training and Certifi-
   cation Requirements, and Table 6.3., AF EM Program Education and Training Courses, prescribes the
   EM training requirements and training frequencies. Calculate the rating based on total EM training
   requirements. Do not include CBRNE Defense Awareness and Survival Skills training requirements
   in the calculations. The rating is based on the total number of personnel requiring training divided into
   the number of personnel currently trained (Table A9.2. (Added)). Any sub-area rated less that Green
   requires explanation for improvement and get well dates. Functional Area OPR: Readiness and Emer-
   gency Management; OCR: Unit Commanders.
