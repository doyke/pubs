This instruction implements AFPD 91-2, Safety Programs. It establishes precautionary measures
and actions to be taken upon issuance of a “Thunderstorm Watch”, advising the potential for
lightning within 5NM (5.75 miles) of Luke AFB is likely to occur within 30 minutes, and upon
issuance of a “Thunderstorm Warning” indicating lightning has been observed within 5NM of
Luke AFB. This publication is applicable to all personnel conducting explosive operations in
support of combat aircraft on Luke AFB. This publication does apply to Air Force Reserve
Command (AFRC) and to Air National Guard (ANG) Units. Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF
Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field
through the appropriate functional’s chain of command. Ensure that all records created as a
result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN33-
363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records
Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. The
previous “References” and “General Guidance” sections have been removed. Section 1 now
contains a “Definitions of Weather Terms” used by the instruction.                 Commander
“Responsibilities” have been move section 2 and expanded to include the 56th and 756th Aircraft
Maintenance Squadron Commanders. The “Procedures” listed under section 3 have been
separated into two sections to better detail the specific actions units must take when the
installation is under a “Thunderstorm Watch” and a “Thunderstorm Warning”.

1. Definition of Weather Terms:
     1.1. Thunderstorm Advisory. An Observed Weather Advisory issued when a particular
     weather event first occurs and the customer does not require advance notification of the
     observed weather phenomenon. A Thunderstorm Advisory is issued when thunderstorms are
     observed within 25NM of the installation, but are expected to remain outside 5NM of the
     installation.
     1.2. Thunderstorm Watch. A special notice issued when the potential for lightning within
     5NM of Luke AFB is likely to occur within 30 minutes. Used to notify operational
     commanders of a potential for environmental conditions to such intensity as to pose a hazard
     to life or property and are used to make force protection and ORM decisions.
     1.3. Thunderstorm Warning (Lightning within 5NM). An Observed Weather Warning
     issued when lightning is observed within 5NM of Luke AFB. Used as a special notice to
     notify operational commanders when an established weather condition of such intensity as to
     pose a hazard to life or property is occurring. Throughout this instruction “Lightning within
     5NM” is referred to as a "Thunderstorm Warning."
     1.4. The 56th Operations Support Squadron Weather Flight provides weather support to
     the56th Fighter Wing. Refer to LUKEAFBI 15-101, Weather Support, for detailed 56 FW
     guidance regarding weather phenomena.
2. Responsibilities:
     2.1. Commander, 56th Operations Support Squadron will:
        2.1.1. Ensure the Weather Flight issues and cancels thunderstorm warnings, watches, and
        advisories through the Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET). In the event the JET system is
        not operational the Weather Flight will make notifications via phone.
     2.2. Commander, 56th Maintenance Operations Squadron will:
        2.2.1. Ensure the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) relays all thunderstorm
        warnings, watches, and advisories to the entire maintenance complex.
     2.3. Commanders, 56th and 756th Aircraft Maintenance Squadrons will:
        2.3.1. Ensure respective Aircraft Maintenance Unit(s) comply with this instruction.

            3.1.1.1. Direct implementation of the 56 FW Severe Weather Conditions Emergency
            Action Checklist within their respective unit.
            3.1.1.2. Direct the Weapons Expediter to begin the safe and orderly termination of all
            flight line explosive operations unlikely to be completed within 30 minutes of initial
            watch notification.
LUKEAFBI91-201 26 APRIL 2012                                                                  3


        3.1.1.3. Ensure the Weapons Expediter directs weapons personnel to assist the
        munitions line delivery driver(s) in securing and clearing the flight line of munitions
        not expected to be loaded on aircraft within 30 minutes of initial watch notification.
        3.1.1.4. Ensure the Weapons Expediter informs the MOC when flight line explosive
        operations have ceased and munitions not loaded on aircraft have been removed.
     3.1.2. The 56th Equipment Maintenance Squadron Senior Munitions Controller on duty
     will:
        3.1.2.1. Direct implementation of Munitions Control Emergency Action Checklist 5:
        Severe Weather Conditions.
        3.1.2.2. Direct all outside explosive operations to begin a safe and orderly
        termination of operations unlikely to be completed within 30 minutes of initial watch
        notification.
        3.1.2.3. Determine if munitions movements in transit to the flight line are to return to
        the MSA.
        3.1.2.4. In coordination with the Weapons Loading Expediter(s) direct Line Delivery
        drivers to remove munitions not loaded on aircraft from the flight line, and secure as
        directed.
        3.1.2.5. Munitions trailers loaded with inert assets only, (no explosive components)
        do not need to be removed from the flight line, i.e., BDU-50/56 trailers.
        3.1.2.6. Notify the MOC when all Severe Weather Conditions Emergency Action
        Checklist actions have been completed and the flight line is clear of all explosive
        laden munitions trailers.
  3.2. Upon notification of a Thunderstorm Warning:
     3.2.1. Aircraft launch and recovery operations are normally terminated when a
     “Thunderstorm Warning” is issued. The Supervisor of Flying (SOF) will determine if
     running aircraft are to return to their parking locations, hold position, shut-down, or
     proceed to launch.
     3.2.2. The Aircraft Maintenance Production Supervisor or designated representatives
     will:
        3.2.2.1. Ensure all explosive operations have ceased and direct non-essential

        3.2.2.2. Ensure personnel remaining outside in direct support of aircraft launch and
        recovery operations are protected by sheltering inside vehicles to the maximum extent
        possible.
     3.2.3. The 56th Equipment Maintenance Squadron Senior Munitions Controller on duty
     will:
        3.2.3.1. Direct munitions movements in transit at the time a “Thunderstorm
        Warning” is issued to proceed to a munitions holding area protected by a Lightning
        Protection System (LPS).

            3.2.3.2. Direct personnel at explosives locations (indoor and outdoor) which do not
            have a functional LPS to cease operations and evacuate to Public Traffic Route
            distance. Include all locations within the PTR arc of the inoperative LPS location.
            3.2.3.3. Direct explosive operations involving unpackaged Electro-Explosive
            Devices (EEDs) in facilities protected by a LPS to cease, and the maintenance bay in
            which these operations are taking place vacated. Evacuation of the facilities’ non-
            maintenance administrative areas is not required.
            3.2.3.4. Indoor explosive operations (not involving EEDs) in facilities equipped with
            a LPS may continue. Only the Munitions Flight CC/Chief may approve continued
            explosive operations after assessing risk and mission impact.
4. Safety Precautions:
     4.1. Direction to discontinue explosive operations and seek immediate shelter does not grant
     authority to exceed speed limits or ignore explosive safety practices.
     4.2. Supervisors must alert unit leadership anytime they perceive personnel are exposed to
     an un-necessary risk from severe weather. Supervisors have the authority to suspend outside
     work under their control due to severe weather concerns, (knock-it-off) even in the absence
     of an active weather statement. In such a case immediately relay severe weather concerns or
     observations to the 56th Operations Support Squadron Weather Flight.
