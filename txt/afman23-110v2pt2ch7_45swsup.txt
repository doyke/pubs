SECTION B

                                        Attachment 7B1

              907 REJ INPUT EXCEEDS PROJECT FMR FUND BALANCE

The MRSP personnel will process aircraft requirements, which result in a 907 reject, where the
only asset available is in the MRSP, using UJC 1A. These actions are necessary, as TEX 3 is not
authorized for MSI inputs. Once a 907 reject is received from any organization, subsequent
requests would be held without processing until funds are available. Base Supply will hold the
documents for a maximum of six days (awaiting resolution of the funding shortage in the PFMR)
before returning the unprocessed document to the originator.
