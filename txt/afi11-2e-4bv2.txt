                                               Chapter 1

                                       GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. This instruction provides flight examiners and aircrew members with procedures and
evaluation criteria used during flight evaluations. It is a reference document and a standard for
evaluation purposes. Adherence to these procedures and criteria will ensure an accurate assessment of
the proficiency and capabilities of aircrew members. Each crew specialty has a separate chapter in this
AFI that provides specific information and grading criteria for that specialty.
1.2. Recommendation for Change of Publication. Recommendations for improvements to this
volume will be submitted on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, IAW AFI 11-
215, Flight Manuals Program, to HQ ACC/A3YR. Recommendations approved will be forwarded to
HQ ACC/A3TV, collated into interim or formal change notices, and forwarded to HQ USAF/A3O-AT
for HQ USAF approval.
1.3. Waivers. IAW AFI 11-202V2 and ACC Supplement procedures, waiver requests must be routed
through the Numbered Air Force (NAF) for comment. Waiver approval authority is HQ ACC/A3, with
HQ ACC/A3TV/A3YR coordination. All waiver requests will be submitted in memo or message format
and must include the following, as applicable:
    1.3.1. Name, rank, crew position, type aircraft, type of evaluation, expiration date, and applicable
    paragraph.
    1.3.2. Justification for waiver.
    1.3.3. Unit plan of action.
1.4. Procedures:
    1.4.1. Standardization Evaluation Flight Examiners (SEFE) will use the grading policies contained
    in AFI 11-202V2 and the evaluation criteria in this instruction for conducting all E-4B Flight and
    Emergency Procedures evaluations (EPE). All evaluations assume smooth air, a stable platform and
    normal operating conditions. Deliberately misleading questions and compound Emergency
    Procedures will not be used.
    1.4.2. All evaluations fall under the Qualification (QUAL), Instrument (INSTM), Instructor
    (INSTR), or SPOT categories listed in AFI 11-202V2. For difference evaluations which do not
    update an eligibility zone, list as ―Spot‖ on the front of the AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew
    Qualification, and explain that it was a difference evaluation under ―Mission Description.‖
    Instrument evaluations apply to pilots only. Schedule all evaluation activity on one sortie to the
    greatest extent possible. Do not begin an evaluation until all training items required for that
    evaluation are complete.
       1.4.2.1. During all evaluations, any grading areas observed by the SEFE may be evaluated. If
       additional training is required for areas outside of the scheduled evaluation, document the
       training required under the appropriate area on the AF Form 8.
       1.4.2.2. Each chapter in this instruction contains a table of requirements for various evaluations.
       Accompanying each table are notes that may be found at the bottom of the individual grading
       criteria (designated by an ―X‖). To complete an evaluation, all areas annotated with an ―R‖ must
       be successfully completed. SEFEs will make every effort to evaluate all required areas during
       flight. When a required area cannot be evaluated in-flight because of equipment malfunctions,
AFI11-2E-4BV2 4 JUNE 2009                                                                             5


      weather conditions, operational requirements, or lack of adequate operating airspace, the area
      may be graded using a ground simulator or a verbal evaluation at OG/CC discretion. OGV will
      define in the 55th OG Evaluation Profile Letter those areas that MUST be evaluated in flight.
   1.4.3. Prior to beginning an evaluation, the SEFE will explain the purpose of the evaluation and how
   it will be conducted to the evaluatee. After the briefing, the examinee will accomplish any required
   mission planning and provide the SEFE copies of any mission planning materials upon request.
   1.4.4. During an evaluation, the SEFE will assess the examinee performance for each required
   grading area and note discrepancies when deviations occur. SEFEs must intervene to prevent/correct
   breaches of flying safety or flight discipline and to prevent aircraft/equipment capabilities from
   being exceeded.
   1.4.5. Post-evaluation, the SEFE will compare the examinee’s performance with the tolerances
   provided in the grading criteria and assign an appropriate grade for each area. Momentary
   deviations from tolerances will not be considered in the grading, provided the examinee applies
   prompt action and such deviations do not jeopardize flying safety. Cumulative deviations will be
   considered when determining the overall grade. Deviations incurred while employing the ―See and
   Avoid‖ concept will be considered momentary deviations. The SEFE will state the examinee’s
   overall rating, thoroughly critique specific deviations, area grades assigned and assign any required
   additional training.
1.5. General Evaluation Requirements:
   1.5.1. Publications Check . The publications check is a requisite to all qualification evaluations,
   and will be annotated in the Comments block of the AF Form 8 only if unsatisfactory. Satisfactory
   performance for individual flight publications requires that they be current and properly posted.
   Publications will be maintained either hard copy, electronically (Flash drive), or both by front-end
   crewmembers (P, N, FE, FA). For those crewmembers maintaining only electronic publications on a
   flash drive, the evaluator will check that they have the most current version on their flash drive.
   AFI 11-2E-4 Vol 3, E-4 Operations Procedures, and the local OGV supplement to AFI 11-202 Vol
   2 dictate the required publications to be maintained and/or carried in-flight by crewmembers.
   1.5.2. Examinations:
      1.5.2.1. Qualification Examination (Open book). This exam consists of questions derived
      from applicable flight manuals and governing directives. The exam will consist of at least 50
      questions. Units may increase the number of questions to provide an in-depth evaluation of the
      examinee's knowledge.
      1.5.2.2. Emergency Procedures Examination (Closed book and Bold Face). A general
      knowledge emergency procedures exam containing two parts: questions covering a cross-section
      of Warnings and Cautions from flight manuals applicable to the individual’s crew position/unit
      mission and a Bold Face test, when applicable, for each critical action procedure. A correct Bold
      Face response will include proper order and intent; correct spelling is not graded.
      1.5.2.3. Instrument Examination (IRC). Required for navigators (Qualification requisite) and
      for pilots taking instrument evaluations (included in the unit Instrument Refresher Course).
   1.5.3. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). Document the method of EPE accomplishment
   in comments block of the AF Form 8. The EPE scenario must accurately evaluate the required
   areas. Qualification EPEs must cover applicable Bold Face and Critical Action Procedures (CAPs),
6                                                                        AFI11-2E-4BV2 4 JUNE 2009


    emergency procedures, and systems operation. Use the Emergency Procedures grading criteria in
    this chapter to evaluate the EPE.
    1.5.4. Qualification/Mission Evaluation. Mission evaluations are integrated into the qualification
    evaluation. The requirements for qualification in this volume ensures that all necessary tasks
    required to perform operational, test, and training sorties on this platform are accomplished during
    instrument and/or qualification evaluations. This evaluation will be combined with instrument
    evaluations, as applicable for the crew position.
    1.5.5. Instructor Evaluation. All instructor aircrew members will be evaluated on their ability as
    an instructor during their initial instructor upgrade evaluation and on all periodic evaluations.
    Instructor flight evaluations will be conducted with a student occupying the applicable aircrew
    position whenever possible (exception-pilot instructor evaluations, see paragraph 2.1.4.). The
    student will perform those duties prescribed by the instructor for the mission being accomplished. If
    an actual student is not available, the SEFE will identify to the examinee (prior to the mission) the
    level of performance to be expected from the SEFE/instructor acting as the student. If this option is
    utilized, at least one event or briefing must be instructed as an ―initial demo.‖ The instructor
    examinee will monitor all phases of flight from an advantageous position and be prepared to
    demonstrate or explain any area or procedure. The SEFE will note the instructor’s ability to
    recognize student difficulties and provide effective, timely corrective action. The SEFE will also
    evaluate grade assignment, Training Accomplishment Progress Report (TAPR) completion for all
    instructor checks. All instructor evaluations will include a student briefing based on a thorough
    review of an actual or simulated student training folder/required documentation. This evaluation
    may be combined to realign an evaluation zone, provided primary emphasis remains on instructional
    ability. Accomplish initial instructor evaluations on actual student instructional missions whenever
    possible. Periodic instructor evaluations will be administered in conjunction with required
    qualification, and instrument (if applicable) flight evaluations. During these evaluations, the
    examinee must occupy the primary duty position for an adequate period of time to demonstrate
    proficiency in the crew position. Note: During instructor evaluations, SEFEs must exercise sound
    judgment to ensure questions are not only comprehensive, but more importantly, pertinent to the
    crew member’s duties, responsibilities and experience level.
    1.5.6. Instructor Requalification Evaluations. Former instructors who meet AFI 11-2E-4V1, E-4
    Aircrew Training, criteria to re-qualify as instructors may receive a combined qualification/instructor
    flight evaluation.
    1.5.7. Instrument Evaluations. Instrument evaluations apply to pilots only. See chapter 2 of this
    volume for specific requirements.
    1.5.8. Unlike Specialty Evaluation. All SEFEs must report deviations/discrepancies from
    established procedures/directives in any area, regardless of the individual’s crew specialty, to the
    Squadron Commander (SQ/CC) or Operations Officer (SQ/DO), and Chief of OGV for action.
    Annotate SPOT in the Flight Phase block of the AF Form 8. The Chief of OGV will sign as the
    flight examiner. If a SEFE is flying as an instructor or crewmember and deviations are observed,
    report deviations to appropriate individuals (No AF Form 8).
1.6. Grading Instructions and General Grading Criteria. Standards and performance parameters are
contained in AFI 11-202V2 and this instruction. A three-level grading system is used for most areas,
however a ―Q-‖ grade will not be indicated under critical areas.
    1.6.1. General Criteria. The following general qualification and the instructor grading criteria are
    common to all crew positions, (except as noted) and will be used for all applicable evaluations:
AFI11-2E-4BV2 4 JUNE 2009                                                                             7

                                         PILOT EVALUATIONS

2.1. Instructions:
     2.1.1. The grading criteria contained in this chapter are applicable to evaluations for pilots and were
     established by experience, policies, and procedures set forth in flight manuals and other directives.
     SEFEs must realize that grading criteria contained herein cannot cover every situation. Written
     parameters must be tempered with mission objectives and, more importantly, mission/task
     accomplishment in the determination of overall aircrew performance. Specific requirements for
     each evaluation are as follows:
     2.1.2. Qualification Evaluations:
        2.1.2.1. Ground Requisites. Qualification Examination (open book), Emergency Procedures
        Examination (closed book and Boldface/CAPs), Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE) and
        Publications Check.
        2.1.2.2. Flight Phase. All areas required in table 2.1. under ―QUAL‖ will be evaluated.
     2.1.3. Instrument Evaluations:
        2.1.3.1. Ground Requisites.         Instrument Refresher Course (IRC) and written Instrument
        Examination.
        2.1.3.2. Flight Phase. All areas required in table 2.1. under ―INSTM‖ will be evaluated. The
        instrument flight phase will normally be combined with the qualification flight phase. Note:
        Pilots with an expired instrument check must fly under the direct supervision of an IP.
        2.1.4.1. Instructor Evaluations. Pilots receiving initial instructor evaluations should occupy
        the right seat during the evaluation. An IP or SEFE should occupy the left seat. On periodic
        evaluations, instructors may occupy either seat to accomplish required items. A student, pilot, IP
        or SEFE may occupy the other seat. The SEFE may, during any phase of the evaluation, require
        the instructor examinee to demonstrate and/or present verbal explanations to the SEFE on air
        refueling, emergency procedures/equipment, aircraft systems (location, configuration, operation,
        procedures, and techniques), mission knowledge or any other operating procedures and
        techniques. Demonstrations will be pre-briefed to the examinee and will be accomplished at an
        appropriate time so as not to interfere with the examinee's crew duties and pacing. Instructors on
        recurring evaluations should instruct based on the needs of the student (actual or simulated). All
        areas required in table 2.1. under ―INSTR‖ will be evaluated.
        2.1.4.2. Instructor Requalification Evaluation. Former instructors who have regained
        currency and qualification in the aircraft, and who meet training volume criteria to re-qualify as a
        instructor, will receive a instructor flight evaluation consisting of a student pre-briefing, in flight
        instruction based on student (real or simulated) needs, and a post-flight critique TAPR. In flight
        instruction will include the demos listed in para 2.1.4.1 and areas listed in table 2.1., under
        ―INSTR‖, but no other specific in flight events are required. If the former instructor requires
        initial instructor training/evaluation based on guidance in the training volume, or if the instructor
        requalification is concurrent with the aircraft requalification, comply with para 2.1.5.
     2.1.5. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). Additional guidance: EPEs will evaluate the
     pilot’s performance of all Boldface/CAPs, a cross- section of noncritical emergency procedures,
AFI11-2E-4BV2 4 JUNE 2009                                                                            13


   knowledge and performance of general systems operation, and unusual attitude recoveries. Use the
   Emergency Procedures-Bold Face criteria for Bold Face/CAPs, and the Emergency Procedures
   criteria for all other emergency situations given. Use Systems Knowledge/Operation criteria to
   evaluate general systems operation.
2.2. Evaluation Requirements. Table 2.1 lists areas for pilot qualification, instrument, and instructor
evaluations. An ―R‖ indicates a requirement for that evaluation. The NOTES column may include an
―X‖ which refers to a general note found in the specific grading criteria table.

                                     NAVIGATOR EVALUATIONS

3.1. Instructions. The grading criteria contained in this chapter are applicable to evaluations for
navigators and were established by experience, policies, and procedures set forth in flight manuals and
other directives. Flights conducted over land on established airways will make maximum use of
available equipment and aids. SEFEs must realize that grading criteria contained herein cannot cover
every situation. Written parameters must be tempered with mission objectives and, more importantly,
mission/task accomplishment in the determination of overall aircrew performance.
     3.1.1. Qualification Evaluations:
        3.1.1.1. Ground Requisites. Qualification Examination (open book), Emergency Procedures
        Examination (closed book), Instrument Refresher Course (IRC), written Instrument Examination,
        Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE) and Publications Check.
        3.1.1.2. Flight Phase. All areas required in Table 3.1 under ―QUAL‖ will be evaluated.
     3.1.2. Instructor Evaluations:
        3.1.2.1. Instructor Evaluations. The SEFE may, during any phase of the evaluation, require
        the instructor examinee to demonstrate and/or present verbal explanations to the SEFE on air
        refueling, emergency procedures/equipment, aircraft systems (location, configuration, operation,
        procedures, and techniques), mission knowledge or any other operating procedures and
        techniques. Demonstrations will be pre-briefed to the examinee and will be accomplished at an
        appropriate time so as not to interfere with the examinee's crew duties and pacing. Instructors on
        recurring evaluations should instruct based on the needs of the student (actual or simulated). All
        areas required in Table 3.1 under ―INSTR‖ will be evaluated.
        3.1.2.2. Instructor Requalification Evaluations. Former instructors who have regained
        currency and qualification in the aircraft, and who meet training volume criteria to re-qualify as
        instructors will receive an instructor flight evaluation consisting of a student pre-briefing, in
        flight instruction based on student (real or simulated) needs, and a post-flight critique TAPR. In
        flight instruction will include the areas listed in Table 3.1, under ―INSTR,‖ but no other specific
        in flight events are required. If the former instructor requires initial instructor training/evaluation
        based on guidance in the training volume, or if the instructor requalification is concurrent with
        the aircraft requalification, comply with para 3.1.3.1.
     3.1.3. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). Additional guidance: Use the Emergency
     Procedures criteria to evaluate Emergency Procedures Evaluations. The EPE satisfies the in-flight
     requirements for Area 4, Emergency Procedures, if no actual emergency procedure is experienced in
     flight.
3.2. Evaluation Requirements. Table 3.1 lists areas for navigator qualification, and instructor
evaluations. An ―R‖ indicates a requirement for that evaluation. The NOTES column may include an
―X‖ which refers to a general note found in the specific grading criteria table.

AFI11-2E-4BV2 4 JUNE 2009                                                                           27


     3.3.2.3. AREA 11 – DEPARTURE:
        3.3.2.3.1. Q. Monitored headings, altitudes and aircraft position throughout the departure.
        Provided headings, ETAs and other required information in a timely manner. Ensured
        adequate terrain clearance by monitoring the departure on airborne radar and followed
        through on a SID, if applicable.
        3.3.2.3.2. Q-. Monitored headings, altitudes, position and terrain clearance. Was slow to
        provide headings, ETAs or other appropriate information. Performance did not degrade
        mission accomplishment nor compromise flight safety. Procedures to monitor the
        departure/SID were minimally acceptable.
        3.3.2.3.3. U. Did not monitor headings, altitude or terrain clearance during the departure.
        Was not aware of aircraft position and was unable to provide updated information when
        required. Did not use a SID or appropriate local area chart.
     3.3.2.4. AREA 12 – INSTRUMENT CHECKS:
        3.3.2.4.1. Q. Correctly computed deviation checks when required by the flight manual or
        mission requirements. Correctly computed TAS check when a known or suspected TAS
        instrument failure occurs. Errors did not exceed 1 degree or 4 knots. Compass cross checks
        were made periodically and other instruments were monitored as applicable.
        3.3.2.4.2. Q-. Same as for Q except minor errors in readings or computations were made not
        affecting accuracy of checks by more than 2 degrees or 8 knots.
        3.3.2.4.3. U. Did not accomplish deviation or TAS checks when required. Computation
        errors exceeded Q- criteria. Did not monitor other instruments as applicable.
     3.3.2.5. AREA 13 - DEAD RECKONING:
        3.3.2.5.1. Q. During general navigation, did not allow the airplane to deviate outside the
        ATC allowable airspace and in no case was the deviation more than 10 NM (4 NM or as
        specified for operations below FL 180) from the course. Did not deviate outside the ATC
        assigned/protected lateral airspace. Met/attempted to meet planned air refueling mission
        timing using all reasonable effort. If unable to make the refueling time, coordinated a revised
        ARCT. No training was lost by the tanker or receiver which could be attributed to the
        navigator’s error. Navigation leg departure position was accurate within 5 NM.
        3.3.2.5.2. Q-. During general navigation, did not allow the plane to deviate outside the ATC
        allowable airspace and in no case was the deviation more than 15 NM (10 NM or as specified
        for operations below FL 180) from the course. Ineffective timing control resulted in
        unnecessarily delaying the air refueling rendezvous; however, no significant training was lost
        by either tanker or receiver. Navigation leg departure position was accurate within 10 NM.
        3.3.2.5.3. U. Exceeded Q- standards. Allowed the aircraft to deviate outside ATC
        assigned/protected lateral airspace. Significant training was lost by tanker/receiver. NOTE
        1: Navigators must demonstrate procedures and techniques of INS/FMS navigation as the
        primary means of navigation (aid to DR) for the entire mission. NOTE 2: General
        navigation for the navigator commences upon level off and ceases when the pilot or air
        traffic controller assumes navigation to the terminal facility.
     3.3.2.6. AREA 14 – PACING:
28                                                                   AFI11-2E-4BV2 4 JUNE 2009


        3.3.2.6.1. Q. Held an even work flow achieving maximum use of available time. Stayed
        ahead of flight progress. Ensured accurate and timely position reports. Expeditiously dealt
        with deviations from original flight plan. Navigation leg departure position obtained no later
        than 10 minutes after departure point.

AFI11-2E-4BV2 4 JUNE 2009                                                                          29


        3.3.2.9.2. Q-. Navigation equipment was not operated IAW prescribed procedures.
        Equipment malfunctions were incorrectly analyzed or corrective actions were incomplete or
        incorrect. Variations or omissions in prescribed procedures, erroneous data insertion or
        faulty techniques caused a significant degradation of equipment performance. In any case,
        actions could not have damaged equipment or jeopardized mission objectives. INS/FMS
        coordinates were never more than 10 NM in error provided there were no equipment
        malfunctions. Radar positioning accuracy did not exceed 15 NM (using 50 NM or less
        range).
        3.3.2.9.3. U. Exceeded Q- criteria. NOTE: The extent of in flight corrective action
        required of the navigator to overcome a search radar malfunction will be determined by the
        mission requirements and the criticality of the malfunctioning radar
     3.3.2.10. AREA 18 - RENDEZVOUS /AIR REFUELING:
        3.3.2.10.1. Q. Rendezvous and air refueling procedures were in accordance with prescribed
        directives and all checklists were accomplished with no more than minor discrepancies.
        Every reasonable effort was made to make RVIP timing within +/- 1 minute, or the ARCT
        within +/- 2 minutes of scheduled. Positive identification of the tanker radar return was
        made. Turn range and offset were computed, cross-checked and correctly used within 2 NM.
        3.3.2.10.2. Q-. Displayed lack of knowledge and familiarity with the checklists and/or
        rendezvous and air refueling procedures. However, knowledge was sufficient to ensure
        rendezvous and air refueling with minimal loss of training time/activity. Computations were
        in error by more than 2 NM, but did not exceed 5 NM in error. Arrival at ARCT greater than
        2 minutes, but less than 4 minutes. RVIP timing was greater than 1 minute but did not
        exceed 2 minutes.
        3.3.2.10.3. U. Displayed lack of knowledge and familiarity with the checklists and/or
        rendezvous and air refueling procedures to the extent that the rendezvous or air refueling was
        jeopardized or precluded or significant training time/activity was lost. Effort to make timing
        good was possible to within 2 minutes but failed to attempt. Failure to accomplish positive
        aircraft identification resulted in an actual or attempted rendezvous with the wrong aircraft.
        Timing and computations exceeded Q- criteria. NOTE 1: Navigators must demonstrate
        proficiency in receiver air refueling tactics IAW TO 1E-4B-1(II) and ATP-56(B). NOTE 2:
        Air refueling includes rendezvous (point parallel or en route), inter-plane communications,
        breakaway and post-refueling. NOTE 3: Every effort will be made to evaluate air refueling
        procedures in-flight. However if a tanker rendezvous cancels on the same day of the planned
        sortie, air refueling procedures may be accomplished verbally for recurring evaluations and
        at the discretion of the SEFE for requalification evaluations. For initial qualification
        evaluations, air refueling rendezvous procedures must be evaluated in-flight with a tanker.
     3.3.2.11. AREA 19 - DESCENT/APPROACH/LANDING:
        3.3.2.11.1. Q. Monitored aircraft position and approach instructions. Furnished the pilot
        with headings, ETAs, and other information when required. Thoroughly understood
        approach and/or missed approach instructions and procedures. Monitored appropriate FLIP
        terminal approach plate. Ensured terrain clearance.
        3.3.2.11.2. Q-. Monitored aircraft position but did not monitor or understand approach
        and/or missed approach instructions/procedures. Slow in providing headings, ETAs, and
        other information when required.

                                FLIGHT ENGINEER EVALUATIONS

4.1. Instructions. The grading criteria contained in this chapter are applicable to evaluations for flight
engineers and were established by experience, policies and procedures set forth in flight manuals and
other directives. SEFEs must realize that grading criteria contained herein cannot cover every situation.
Written parameters must be tempered with mission objectives and more importantly, mission/task
accomplishment in the determination of overall aircrew performance.
   4.1.1. Qualification Evaluations:
       4.1.1.1. Ground Requisites. Qualification Examination (open book), Emergency Procedures
       Examination (closed book and Boldface/CAPs), Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE), and
       Publications Check.
       4.1.1.2. Flight Phase. All areas required in Table 4.1 under ―QUAL‖ will be evaluated.
   4.1.2. Instructor Evaluations:
       4.1.2.1. Instructor Evaluations. The SEFE may, during any phase of the evaluation, require
       the instructor examinee to demonstrate and/or present verbal explanations to the SEFE on air
       refueling, emergency procedures/equipment, aircraft systems (location, configuration, operation,
       procedures, and techniques), mission knowledge or any other operating procedures and
       techniques. Demonstrations will be pre-briefed to the examinee and will be accomplished at an
       appropriate time so as not to interfere with the examinee’s crew duties and pacing. Instructors
       on recurring evaluations should instruct based on the needs of the student (actual or simulated).
       All areas required in Table 4.1 under ―INSTR‖ will be evaluated.
       4.1.2.2. Instructor Requalification Evaluations. Former instructors who have regained
       currency and qualification in the aircraft, and who meet training volume criteria to re-qualify as
       instructors, will receive an instructor flight evaluation consisting of a student pre-briefing, in
       flight instruction based on student (real or simulated) needs and a post-flight critique TAPR. In
       flight instruction will include the areas listed in Table 4.1, under ―INSTR,‖ but no other specific
       in flight events are required. If the former instructor requires initial instructor training/evaluation
       based on guidance in the training volume or if the instructor requalification is concurrent with
       the aircraft requalification, comply with para 4.1.2.
   4.1.3. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). Additional guidance: EPEs will evaluate the
   flight engineer’s performance of all Boldface/CAPs, a cross-section of noncritical emergency
   procedures, and knowledge and performance of general systems operation. Use the Emergency
   Procedures – Bold Face criteria for Bold Face/CAPs, and the Emergency Procedures criteria for all
   other emergency situations given. Use Systems Knowledge/Operation criteria to evaluate general
   systems operation. The EPE satisfies the in-flight requirements for Area 4, Emergency Procedures,
   if no actual/simulated emergency procedure is experienced in flight.
4.2. Evaluation Requirements. Table 4.1. lists areas for flight engineer qualification, and instructor
evaluations. An ―R‖ indicates a requirement for that evaluation. An ―X‖ in the notes column refers to a
general note found in the specific grading criteria table.

                              FLIGHT ATTENDANT EVALUATIONS

5.1. Instructions. The grading criteria contained in this chapter are applicable to evaluations for flight
attendants and were established by experience, policies and procedures set forth in flight manuals and
other directives. SEFEs must realize that grading criteria contained herein cannot cover every situation.
Written parameters must be tempered with mission objectives and, more importantly, mission/task
accomplishment in the determination of overall aircrew performance.
   5.1.1. Qualification Evaluations:
       5.1.1.1. Ground Requisites. Qualification Examination (open book), Emergency Procedures
       Examination (closed book), Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE), and Publications Check.
       5.1.1.2. Flight Phase. All areas required in Table 5.1 under ―QUAL‖ will be evaluated.
   5.1.2. Instructor Evaluations:
       5.1.2.1. Instructor Evaluations. The SEFE may, during any phase of the evaluation, require
       the instructor examinee to demonstrate and/or present verbal explanations to the SEFE on air
       refueling, emergency procedures/equipment, aircraft systems (location, configuration, operation,
       procedures, and techniques), mission knowledge or any other operating procedures and
       techniques. Demonstrations will be pre-briefed to the examinee and will be accomplished at an
       appropriate time so as not to interfere with the examinee’s crew duties and pacing. Instructors
       on recurring evaluations should instruct based on the needs of the student (actual or simulated).
       All areas required in Table 5.1 under ―INSTR‖ will be evaluated.
       5.1.2.2. Instructor Requalification Evaluations. Former instructors who have regained
       currency and qualification in the aircraft, and who meet training volume criteria to re-qualify as
       instructors will receive an instructor flight evaluation consisting of a student pre-briefing, in
       flight instruction based on student (real or simulated) needs and a post-flight critique TAPR. In
       flight instruction will include the areas listed in Table 5.1 under ―INSTR‖, but no other specific
       in flight events are required. If the former instructor requires initial instructor training/evaluation
       based on guidance in the training volume, or if the instructor requalification is concurrent with
       the aircraft requalification, comply with para 5.1.2.
   5.1.3. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). Additional guidance: Use the Emergency
   Procedures criteria to evaluate Emergency Procedures Evaluations. The EPE satisfies the in-flight
   requirements for Area 4, Emergency Procedures, if no actual emergency procedure is experienced in
   flight.
5.2. Evaluation Requirements. Table 5.1 lists areas for flight attendant qualification, and instructor
evaluations. An ―R‖ indicates a requirement for that evaluation. An ―X‖ in the notes column refers to a
general note found in the specific grading criteria table.

      COMMUNICATION CONTROL OFFICER (CCO)/AIRBORNE COMMUNICATION
        SPECIALISTS (ACS) /SUPER HIGHT FREQUENCY (SHF) EVALUATIONS

6.1. Instructions. The grading criteria applicable to evaluations for Communication Control Officers,
Airborne Communication System Operators/Maintainers and Super High Frequency
Operators/Maintainers are established by experience, policies and procedures set forth in flight manuals
and other directives. SEFEs must realize that grading criteria contained herein cannot cover every
situation. Flight evaluations should be scheduled on one sortie as a composite evaluation covering all
applicable systems. CCO/ACS/ SHF evaluations may be given on the primary alert aircraft with written
approval from the SQ/CC. Written parameters must be tempered with mission objectives and, more
importantly, mission/task accomplishment in the determination of overall aircrew performance.
     6.1.1. Qualification Evaluations:
        6.1.1.1. Ground Requisites. Qualification Examination (open book), Emergency Procedures
        Examination (closed book), and Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE).
        6.1.1.2. Flight Phase. All areas required in Table 6.1 under ―QUAL‖ will be evaluated.
     6.1.2. Instructor Evaluations:
        6.1.2.1. Instructor Evaluations. The SEFE may, during any phase of the evaluation, require
        the instructor examinee to demonstrate and/or present verbal explanations to the SEFE on
        emergency procedures/equipment, aircraft systems (location, configuration, operation,
        procedures, and techniques), mission knowledge or any other operating procedures and
        techniques. Demonstrations will be pre-briefed to the examinee and will be accomplished at an
        appropriate time so as not to interfere with the examinee's crew duties and pacing. Instructors on
        recurring evaluations should instruct based on the needs of the student (actual or simulated). All
        areas required in Table 6.1 under ―INSTR‖ will be evaluated. Initial instructor checks may be
        accomplished in-flight or on the ground/alert.
        6.1.2.2. Instructor Requalification Evaluations. Former instructors who have regained
        currency and qualification in the aircraft, and who meet training volume criteria to re-qualify as
        instructors will receive an instructor flight or ground evaluation consisting of a student pre-
        briefing, instruction based on student (real or simulated) needs and a post-flight critique TAPR.
        Instruction will include the areas listed in Table 6.1, under ―INSTR,‖ but no other specific events
        are required. If the former instructor requires initial instructor training/evaluation based on
        guidance in the training volume or if the instructor requalification is concurrent with the aircraft
        requalification, comply with para 6.1.2.
     6.1.3. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). Additional guidance: ACS crewmembers may
     cover troubleshooting and repair. Use the Emergency Procedures criteria to evaluate Emergency
     Procedures Evaluations. The EPE satisfies the in-flight requirements for Area 4, Emergency
     Procedures, if no actual emergency procedure is experienced in flight.
6.2. Evaluation Requirements: Table 6.1 lists the areas for CCO/ACS/SHF qualification, and
instructor evaluations. An ―R‖ indicates a requirement for that evaluation.
