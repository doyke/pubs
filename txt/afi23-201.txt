  JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF (JCS) BULK PETROLEUM CONTINGENCY REPORT
            (REPOL) FUNCTIONALITY AND FIELD DEFINITIONS

A6.1. Product Tab.
   A6.1.1. Previous Day Physical Inventory: Consists of previous day's (24 hours) physical
   inventory as of closeout, which represents physical inventory reported on DD Form 2921,
   Physical Inventory Petroleum Products. Total includes storage tanks, pipelines/manifolds,
   and rolling stock. Once an initial REPOL is created, the previous day’s “On-Hand Physical
   Inventory” from the most recent REPOL will auto populate the “Previous Day Physical
   Inventory” field on the current REPOL being created (FMD book inventory).
   A6.1.2. Issues Last 24 Hours: Total of all issues within the last 24 hours as of closeout.
   Issues are fuel transactions made to customers (FMD sales). Do not include fuel shipments.
   A6.1.3. Receipts Last 24 Hours: Total amount of fuel received within the last 24 hours as of
   closeout (FMD receipts).
   A6.1.4. Ordered: The quantity of fuel “Ordered” from a supply source, which is expected to
   be received in the next fuel delivery (Enterprise External Business Portal (EEBP)).
   A6.1.5. Defuels: The total gallon amount of fuel defueled from aircraft, browsers, etc.,
   within the past 24 hours (FMD defuels).
   A6.1.6. Shipments: Transfer of product from one Defense Fuel Support Point (DFSP) to
   another and the transfer of responsibility/accountability for the product shipped from one
   Responsible Officer (RO) or Terminal Manager (TM) to another (FMD shipments).
   A6.1.7. Stockage Objective (SO): The SO is widely used by the Combatant Command
   (CCMD) Joint Petroleum Office (JPO) to establish inventory levels within their Area of
   Responsibility (AOR). The SO value, usually set by the CCMD JPO, is the inventory the
   JPO feels is necessary to maintain at all times in order to ensure mission requirements are
   supported. For locations where the SO has not been established by the CCMD JPO,
   MAJCOMs or HQ USAF in coordination with the MAJCOMs will establish a SO and
   request the COCOM REPOL administrators update the SO in the JCS REPOL. Elements
   contributing SO establishment include Safe Fill, War Reserve Materiel (WRM), Economic
   Resupply Quantity (ERQ), and/or any other value deemed necessary to support mission
   demands.
   A6.1.8. Total Capacity: The amount of storage space available to hold product, which is
   readily available for issue to customers for consumption. It is calculated as the system
   maximum fill (total safe fill) minus unobtainables. This amount can also be determined by
   taking the total safe fill capacity minus the tank bottom inventory.
   A6.1.9. On-Hand Physical Inventory: Total amount of fuel on hand and recorded on the DD
   Form 2921, Physical Inventory Petroleum Products.
   A6.1.10. Remarks: Due to limited space, briefly explain out of tolerance gains/losses in this
   section. Note: All limiting factors including fuel inventories affected by additive types,
