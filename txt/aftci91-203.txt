                                             Chapter 1

                                        INTRODUCTION

1.1. General. The intent of this instruction is to establish a framework and basic requirements
for AFTC test safety programs. This instruction further establishes basic vocabulary and
definitions to be used universally throughout AFTC. Within the framework of this instruction,
wings or their equivalent are expected to develop processes to fulfill the requirements of this
instruction.
1.2. Test Safety Review Process. A Test Safety Review Process typically comprises the
following functions or phases: Planning (Chapter 4), Review (Chapter 5), Coordination and
Approval (Chapter 6), Execution (Chapter 7), Revisions (Chapter 8), Feedback, and Test
Completion and Termination. This instruction provides overall policy and guidance for test
safety activity to ensure standardization of AFTC organizations while adhering to Air Force
Instructions and Air Force Material Command Supplements. Organizations within AFTC will
supplement this instruction to provide further test safety process details that uniquely apply to
their specific test safety requirements.
1.3. Safety Review Process Goals. The goal of any test safety review process is to prevent
mishaps during test activities. This process should identify test hazards and establish both
procedures and corrective actions to eliminate or control the hazards. The process will allow
independent reviewers to evaluate test unique hazards identified by the test team, assess
proposed mitigations and corrective actions, and affirm the test team’s proposed overall risk
level. Once the independent review board has agreed upon and proposed an overall risk level,
the safety plan is reviewed and approved by leadership at a level appropriate for the assessed
risk.
1.4. Risk Management
     1.4.1. Risk Management is the main tool used to prevent mishaps and is the essence of any
     test safety review process within AFTC. While each test may be unique, the test safety
     review process for each test will follow a predictable, consistent process. The policy outlined
     in this instruction and the processes defined in local supplements are tailored to manage risk
     unique to test activity.
1.4.2. At the discretion of subordinate units, the policy defined in this instruction and local
supplement may be used to complete and approve a Risk Management review of non-test
activities.
1.5. Safety Mindset. While test safety processes should be intentionally thorough, no process is
perfect. Everyone involved in test must maintain a safety mindset. A safety mindset does not
assume that a test is safe simply because the test has been reviewed and approved; rather, it is
continually on the lookout for previously unrecognized hazards during test planning and
execution. Once recognized, appropriate actions must be taken to prevent those hazards from
becoming mishaps.
1.6. Scope. This instruction applies to:
     1.6.1. Any ground or flight test activity utilizing AFTC assets. AFTC assets include:
AFTCI91-203 30 APRIL 2014                                                                     5


       1.6.1.1. Resources owned or possessed by AFTC (personnel, aircraft, equipment,
       facilities, etc.).
       1.6.1.2. Ranges or airspace owned or restricted for use by AFTC units.
   1.6.2. Any activity where the AFTC/CC or subordinate commander has responsibility for the
   safety of the general public as the Major Range and Test Facility Base Commander IAW
   DoD 3200.11.
   1.6.3. Any activity utilizing AFTC assets that presents unique hazards not covered by
   published procedures or management directives.
   1.6.4. AFMC assets when AFTC units are assigned as Lead Developmental Test
   Organization (LDTO).
   1.6.5. Any AFTC unit assigned or acting in the capacity of an LDTO that is responsible for
   the safe conduct of test, even when AFTC assets are not at risk.
   1.6.6. Any activities specified by the subordinate unit Test Safety Office.
1.7. Waivers. The AFTC Commander is the waiver authority for this instruction. Guidance in
AFI 91-202, AFMC Sup Chapter 13 would still apply unless waived separately. The AFTC
Chief of Safety (AFTC/SE) may approve minor variations from this instruction provided that the
intent of the test safety process and this instruction are adequately met. Any variations or
waivers approved by AFTC will be documented in an MFR and included in the Safety Annex to
the Test Plan.
1.8. Authority. Compliance with AFTC Test Safety Review Policy does not provide authority
to violate Air Force, AFMC, or AFTC instructions or directives.
   1.8.1. When a test activity must deviate from an AFI or other command directive, units will
   comply with the applicable waivers/deviations process outlined in the applicable document.
   A copy of the waiver will be filed in the Safety Annex. If the waiver authority is within the
   local Wing or Complex chain of command, the waiver may be obtained during the approval
   cycle and documented as a coordination comment within the Safety Annex.
   1.8.2. When a test activity must deviate from a technical order or flight manual, units will
   follow current command guidance. If a waiver is required, a copy of the approved waiver
   will be filed in the Safety Annex. Test teams will note the deviation in the test plan and
   incorporate safety planning as required.

                                      RISK ASSESSMENT

3.1. General. Risk is defined as a combination of mishap severity and mishap probability. The
overall risk level is the degree of risk assumed by leadership in allowing the proposed test to be
accomplished in the manner described and under the conditions specified. Test teams will assess
risk; independent reviewers will evaluate test unique hazards identified by the test team, assess
proposed mitigations and corrective actions, and affirm the test team’s proposed overall risk
level. Once the independent review board has agreed upon a risk level, they will make a
recommendation for a final risk level to the Test Execution Authority (TEA) as outlined in
Chapter 6. Test teams use system safety techniques, prior experience, legacy system research,
and overall engineering judgment to identify test hazards and assess risk by evaluating the
credible outcome (mishap severity) of each hazard together with the associated probability of
occurrence. The mishap severity and probability is then plotted on a Risk Assessment Matrix to
determine the hazard’s overall risk level. Although the goal is to minimize risk through good
test and safety planning/review processes, the test may result in residual risk that must be directly
accepted by the TEA in accordance with Section 6.1.
3.2. Determine Mishap Severity. The mishap severity category is a qualitative assessment of
the most reasonable credible mishap consequence that could occur with all mitigation in place.
For activities at AFTC organizations, the mishap severity categories are shown in Table 3.1.
The assessment should incorporate engineering judgment and/or past experience with similar
tests or systems with all minimizing procedures and corrective actions in place. Descriptive
definitions should be used as the primary criteria for assessing mishap severity. However,
quantitative values may be used for higher cost test articles. Quantitative values for mishap
severity listed in Table 3.1 may be adjusted to match current guidance specified in AFI91-204,
Safety Investigations and Reports.

3.3. Determine Mishap Probability. The safety reviewers will subjectively assess the mishap
probability with all mitigation in place. The mishap probability level should qualitatively and/or
quantitatively measure the likelihood of the mishap occurring due to personnel error,
environmental conditions, design inadequacies, procedural deficiencies, or system/subsystem
component failure or malfunction. The assessment should incorporate engineering judgment and
past experience with similar tests or systems with all minimizing procedures and corrective
actions in place. If available, the test team and safety reviewers should consider the system
safety analysis results from the contractor or system program office in order to understand areas
of known concern. For operations where there is a well-developed database or sophisticated
modeling/simulation, probabilities may be expressed quantitatively as 1 x 10-4, 3.8 x 10-6, etc.
However, for developmental testing, the ability to compute numeric failure probability values
with confidence is difficult because these activities involve new, complex, and often unproven
systems. Therefore, Table 3.2 also contains descriptive probability definitions (along with some
example descriptive statements) that should be used as a standard to consistently assess mishap
probability for all AFTC test activities.

  2 - Test activity (or something similar) done before and a mishap occurred or very nearly did. The test exceeds the design limits. There are
  multiple test-unique single points of failure possible.
  3 - Test activity (or something similar) done before and came close to a mishap. The test is at the design limit. There is at least one test-
  unique single point of failure possible.
  4 - All available analysis has been conducted and no information suggests the chance of mishap occurrence is Frequent or Probable. Test
  activity may never have been done before but areas of concern have been identified. The test is nearing the design limit.
  5 – Test activity (or something similar) done before with no problems encountered. Well within the design limits. No test-unique single
  points of failure.



3.4. Risk Assessment Matrix. The risk assessment matrix, shown in Figure 3.1, is a tool for
assessing mishap risk of test hazards as documented in safety planning documents. The risk
categories are discretely divided into four shaded regions to distinguish between NEGLIGIBLE
(hashed), LOW (white), MEDIUM (grey), and HIGH (diagonal pattern) risk levels. The
correlation of approval authorities with the assigned overall risk level is discussed in Chapter 4.
Despite the discrete distinction between each risk level, safety reviewers are reminded of the
subjective nature of their assessment. This subjectivity is illustrated within the Risk Matrix
using two curved subjectivity lines. The region between the subjectivity lines denotes a
subjective MEDIUM risk level. Any block bisected by a subjectivity line becomes a “block of
subjectivity”. A subjective assessment differing from the discrete risk level blocks is addressed
further in Paragraph 3.6.1. The use of the matrix defined in Figure 3.1 and locally developed
Test Safety Review Processes defined in supplements to this instruction are in accordance with
AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, AFMC Sup, Chapter 13.

      3.5. Negligible Risk. The negligible overall risk category reflects a subset of “low” risk
      applicable to activities that are normal or routine operations. The Negligible Risk category is
      defined as hazards where the severity and probability assessments fall in the Negligible Severity
      column and Occasional, Remote, or Improbable Probability rows on the Risk Assessment
      Matrix. Due to the subjective nature of any risk assessment, an overall assessment greater than
      negligible for these blocks could still be appropriate.
                                                  3.5.1. For the severity category to be Negligible, the consequences of a mishap attributable
                                                  to test activities must be less than minor injury or system damage. For personnel, the impact
                                                  of the injury or illness equates to no work days lost. For equipment or facilities, less than
                                                  minor damage equates to losses less than $50,000 (or current Class D definition). Applicable
                                                  mishap probabilities for NEGLIGIBLE risk are limited to “occasional, “remote”, or
                                                  “improbable” levels. If the test team or reviewers identify test unique hazards that warrant a
                                                  Test Hazard Analysis document, then an overall risk category of NEGLIGIBLE is not
                                                  appropriate.
                                                  3.5.2. Examples include:          ride-along data collection points, special instrumentation
                                                  checkouts, form-fit-function checkouts of non-critical hardware/software, sensor or system
                                                  tests, or logistics testing activities that do not directly affect the airworthiness of an aircraft or
                                                  performance of a test facility nor are they required for hazard avoidance.
      3.6. Determine Overall Risk Assessment. An overall risk level assessment is accomplished
      after all hazards to the test have been identified and mitigations are clearly defined and
      documented in accordance with Section 4.4. Hazards that are unique to the test will be
      documented in the AFTC Form 5000, Test Hazard Analysis (THA). Hazards associated with
      normal operation and maintenance may be documented in a locally produced Baseline Hazard
AFTCI91-203 30 APRIL 2014                                                                        13


Analysis (BHA) form. Plot the combination of mishap severity and probability on the Risk
Assessment Matrix for each hazard. Once all the individual hazards are plotted, the test team
will discuss the safety aspects of the plan and propose an overall project risk level. Project risk
will be no lower than the lowest assessed risk from all the hazards. A detailed explanation of
THAs and BHAs is discussed in Section 4.4 Test Package Documentation.
   3.6.1. Subjective Assessments. As discussed in previous sections, both the THA and overall
   risk assessment can be highly subjective as each test team member and safety reviewer
   incorporates engineering judgment and/or past experience with similar tests or systems into
   their risk level assessment. Because of this subjectivity, a test team or safety reviewer may
   conclude that risk levels that fall within “blocks of subjectivity” may be higher or lower than
   depicted by the discreet risk level regions. For this reason, test teams and safety reviewers
   may utilize the subjectivity lines to fine tune their risk assessment if THA or overall risk
   assessment falls within a block bisected by a subjectivity line. The region between the
   subjectivity lines denotes a subjective MEDIUM risk level. Therefore, subjective risk
   assessments may only be adjusted one risk level higher or lower than the discrete risk
   assessment. The use of subjectivity lines is at the discretion of each Wing or Complex per
   supplements to this instruction.
   3.6.2. THA Risk Assessment. The test team may assess the pre- and post-mitigation mishap
   severity category and probability level by plotting both on the Risk Assessment Matrix at
   Figure 3.1 This provides a comparison between initial and residual risk levels to evaluate
   the adequacy of safety measures and best available solution. Test teams and safety reviewers
   should note that although a minor improvement to the safety plan may not change the
   assessed “severity”, “probability”, or “risk”; it will still reduce the actual risk. The residual
   risk level determined by the test team for each THA acts as a proposal for the independent
   safety reviewers to affirm or adjust as necessary.
   3.6.3. Overall Risk Assessment. The test team will propose an overall risk level for the test
   plan as determined by procedures discussed in this section. During the safety review phase
   (outlined in Chapter 5), the independent safety reviewers will have a general discussion of
   the test, identified hazards, and associated mitigation to generate opinions on the residual
   risk. The discussions should be candid and result in a general agreement by the board,
   although disagreements may occur. Safety reviewers will weigh the control measures in
   place, their experience with the types of tests, and the system under test (SUT) to assess the
   overall risk. The cumulative risk may (and frequently does) exceed the assessed risks for all
   THAs individually. However, the overall risk cannot be lower than the risk associated with
   any individual THA. The safety reviewers must also consider the complexity of the test, the
   potential for safety-related “unknown unknowns”, and their own experience with similar test
   activities. By using the Risk Assessment Matrix (Figure 3.1) and referencing the overall risk
   level descriptions, shown in Table 3.3, each safety reviewer should assess overall risk and
   provide justification for their assessment. This justification is especially important if
   subjective assessments are incorporated as outlined in Paragraph 3.6.1.

       3.6.3.1. In some situations, sufficient information may not be available to complete a risk
       assessment. The Test Safety Office of each AFTC organization will determine a course
       of action to develop resolution and may reconvene the safety reviewers to perform the
       assessment at a later date.
       3.6.3.2. If appropriate, the risk may be assessed separately for AFTC and non-AFTC
       assets, for different phases of the test programs, or for individual test events.
3.7. Elevated Risk Activities. Certain tests conducted at AFTC organizations have
demonstrated a higher than normal risk due to the inherent hazards involved. However, if the
analysis of test activities clearly indicates that the predicted performance (flying qualities, pilot
induced oscillation susceptibility, flutter margin, loads margin, etc.) is well within acceptable
levels, the test point need not be considered elevated risk. This may be especially true if the
analysis model has been validated through other simulation or test activity. In the absence of
quantitative probability data, however, use the following list of tests as a guide in identifying
those tests which require close analysis to determine if an elevated risk level is warranted. The
following list is not all inclusive, other similar activities may also be considered elevated risk:
   3.7.1. Rocket motor test firing.
   3.7.2. High Mach air load wind tunnel testing.

                                            Chapter 4

                             TEST SAFETY PLANNING PHASE

4.1. Test and Safety Planning. Safety planning and test planning are integral and iterative
processes, and as such, both should be interwoven to ensure the test methods incorporate safety
controls where possible. Well planned tests that consider and incorporate risk control measures
to eliminate or mitigate test hazards are inherently safer than test plans without this safety
emphasis. This chapter covers considerations and guidance during the test safety planning and
review phases.
4.2. Safety Considerations During Test Planning.
   4.2.1. Test Approach or Build-up. During test plan development, the test team will carefully
   consider the test approach or build-up. The way the test approaches a hazardous or unknown
   condition must be clearly defined. If predictive analysis does not exist, or has questionable
   validity, the test methodology may require a more refined buildup approach to offset the risk.
   Criteria to continue, or more importantly when to stop, can provide good risk control by
   providing a clearly defined roadmap into the test team’s decision making. This decision-
   making process is extremely important and should be documented.
   4.2.2. Test Plan Size and Complexity. The test team must consider the size and complexity
   of the test plan and assess whether a review of a large, complex safety plan is more or less
   advantageous than several smaller reviews. If feasible, teams may conduct test safety
   planning for large, complex test plans in smaller, less complex safety plans matched to
   progressive phases of the test program.
   4.2.3. Integration. If the planned testing utilizes more than one test plan, test information
   sheet (TIS), or procedure, it is incumbent upon the team to provide a clear test progression
   description. Without a clear path, the ability to identify hazards appropriately and develop a
   sensible risk assessment is difficult. The test team should be aware of this basic issue to
   avoid significant and unplanned schedule delays caused by action items or cancelled safety
   review boards.
4.3. Safety Planning Objectives.
   4.3.1. Identify Test Unique Hazards. The team will identify unique hazards associated with
   each type of test or activity. In some cases test activities may elevate the risk associated with
   routine operational hazards, thus requiring additional safety planning. The following are
   some additional suggestions for identifying test unique hazards.
       4.3.1.1. Refer to archived safety planning for consideration of similar tests.
       4.3.1.2. Contact personnel or test teams with experience in similar test activities or
       testing.
       4.3.1.3. Research technical aspects via technical libraries, internet, etc.
   4.3.2. Eliminate or Control Hazards in the Following Order of Precedence.
AFTCI91-203 30 APRIL 2014                                                                          17


      4.3.2.1. Design the test to eliminate the probability of the hazard occurring. This could
      include a decision to not perform the test if the risk is deemed to be unacceptably high. A
      redesign of the system to eliminate the hazard is another option.
      4.3.2.2. Change the test methodology to reduce the probability, severity, or exposure to
      the hazard (building up to the test condition can be a strong control method).
      4.3.2.3. Incorporate safety devices (e.g. spin chute, or additional power sources).
      4.3.2.4. Provide caution and warning devices to detect an unsafe condition or trend.
      4.3.2.5. Develop procedures and training when it is impractical to change the design or
      test methodology.
4.4. Test Package Documentation
   4.4.1. The “test package” shall be an all-encompassing package of documents consisting of a
   test plan, safety plan, and any other appendices or documentation that support the test
   planning. The safety plan will be located in the “Safety Annex” to the test plan. Additional
   guidance on the test planning process and documentation can be found in local Wing or
   Complex test planning instructions.
   4.4.2. The safety plan should follow documentation guidance from Chapter 13, paragraph
   13.5.4, of AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program as supplemented by
   AFMC. The safety plan shall also include documentation of General Minimizing Procedures
   (GMPs), THAs, BHAs, and a BSR (if applicable). THAs will be documented on an AFTC
   Form 5000, Test Hazard Analysis. BHAs will be documented in accordance with local
   supplements. Format and structure of the safety plan may be further defined in local
   supplements to this instruction.
      4.4.2.1. THAs are stand-alone documents that assess the risk associated with a single test
      unique hazard. A hazard is any condition that has the potential of causing a mishap.
      Confirm that the hazard is not a hazard associated with the basic operation of the aircraft,
      test article, vehicle, system under test, or facility. If the hazard is not unique to the series
      of tests, no THA is required. For example, midair collision with non-participating
      aircraft and bird strikes are not generally considered test unique hazards. However,
      should the very nature of the test increase the probability of these hazards above that of
      normal operations, they should be addressed as test unique hazards. The THA will
      include the following:
          4.4.2.1.1. Mishap severity and probability of the Hazard as discussed in detail in
          Chapter 3.
          4.4.2.1.2. Causes are anything that could lead to the presence of the hazard. This is
          the cause of the hazard, not the mishap. There may be more than one cause.
          4.4.2.1.3. Effect is the mishap that may happen if the hazard is not controlled. The
          mishap is what the THA is trying to prevent and is directly related to the mishap
          severity level.
          4.4.2.1.4. Controls or Minimizing Procedures should be an action or procedure and
          tied to a specific cause, causes, or effect it is trying to control. These attempt to break
          the chain of events linking the causes to the hazard.
18                                                              AFTCI91-203 30 APRIL 2014


         4.4.2.1.5. Corrective Actions or Emergency Procedures are the list of actions taken to
         prevent or mitigate a mishap (the effect) if the hazard occurs. Actions may be taken
         by the control room, ground personnel, flight crew, test facility operators, and anyone
         else participating in the test. Test unique and hazard specific emergency procedures
         would be listed here. If not test unique, corrective actions may state operation manual
         procedures will be followed. These attempt to break the chain of events linking the
         hazard to the mishap.
         4.4.2.1.6. Comments are optional information that help support the THA risk
         analysis but are not directive in nature and do not contribute to breaking the mishap
         chain.
     4.4.2.2. GMPs are stand-alone phrases/statements and used to address test article
     restrictions, test build-up, critical parameter monitoring, go-no-go criteria, weather or
     environmental criteria, and flight test chase requirements among other items of test safety
     concern. Some general minimizing procedures from THAs or BHAs may be repeated as
     a GMP if desired for emphasis.
     4.4.2.3. Baseline Hazard Analysis (BHA) – An analysis used to document known
     hazards concerned with the normal day-to-day operation and maintenance of a system,
     subsystem or facility.
     4.4.2.4. Baseline Safety Report (BSR) – A compilation of the entire baseline hazard
     analysis for a test unit, plant operation, utility, etc. The BSR allows the individual hazard
     analyses that make up the baseline to be evaluated in a comprehensive package and thus
     shows the interaction of the systems and interfaces.
  4.4.3. Safety plans may be prepared electronically or printed and arranged in hardcopy
  format. Electronic signatures may be used for coordination and approval of electronic
  packages.
  4.4.4. Statement of Capability (SOC). The following wording must be included in any SOC
  that is transmitted to a customer when the safety review process is required: “AFTC Safety
  Review: The proposed test/activity must be reviewed using the procedures contained in
  AFTCI 91-203, AFTC Test Safety Review Policy and any local supplements to this
  instruction. To support this review, safety planning must begin early in the program.”
  4.4.5. Mishap Accountability.      Detailed information on mishap accountability and
  investigating responsibility must be provided by the test team in the Safety Annex when
  deviating from AFI 91-204, or if non-Air Force assets are involved, to include pre-mishap
  planning. A memorandum of agreement is the preferred method when multiple agencies are
  involved.
AFTCI91-203 30 APRIL 2014                                                                           19

                               TEST SAFETY REVIEW PHASE

5.1. Safety Review Preparation. In preparation for an independent safety review, test teams
should perform the following:
   5.1.1. Determine the type of safety review (examples in Paragraph 5.2.2) and consult
   Wing/Complex Test Safety office for concurrence.
   5.1.2. Evaluate the probability and severity category for each Test Hazard Analyses (THAs)
   or Baseline Hazard Analyses (BHAs) (Chapter 3). Provide to the safety reviewers the
   proposed overall risk level and any test points or test phases which may have a lower risk
   than the overall risk level (if they exist). Include the rationale for the varying risk levels.
   The proposed risk level(s) will be considered during the independent safety review.
   5.1.3. Develop a list of safety reviewers following guidance in Section 2.3
5.2. Safety Review. The purpose of the Safety Review phase is to allow an independent team to
formally review the test unit’s safety planning to ensure that all test hazards have been identified
and mitigated, and then assess the residual risk. The documentation from the Safety Review
phase should reflect a suitable level of clarity and maturity for the Test Execution Authority to
make an informed decision on whether to proceed with test execution. The Wing or Complex
Test Safety office is the focal point for the Safety Review phase.
   5.2.1. Objectives:
       5.2.1.1. Ensure appropriate test hazards associated with the test activity are identified.
       5.2.1.2. Ensure the proposed risk control measures sufficiently mitigate (minimize or
       eliminate) the hazards caused by the test/activity to an acceptable level.
       5.2.1.3. Assess and recommend an appropriate residual risk level for the test/activity.
   5.2.1.4. Ensure the safety annex clearly and adequately provides enough information to
   support an approval decision by senior leadership.
   5.2.2. Types of Independent Safety Reviews. Below are four types of independent safety
   reviews that may be used to complete the safety review phase. The Wing or Complex Test
   Safety office may advocate additional types of reviews as defined in local supplements to this
   instruction. The test team will review relevant documentation and propose a review type to
   the Test Safety office, who will make the final determination. The four types of independent
   safety reviews are:
   5.2.2.1. Safety Review Board (SRB).
       5.2.2.2. Electronic Safety Review (ESR).
       5.2.2.3. Combined Technical Review Board (TRB)/SRB.
       5.2.2.4. Negligible Risk Review (NRR).
5.3. Safety Review Board. The SRB is a formal safety review meeting attended by
independent safety reviewers and project personnel, and is chaired by a designated Wing or
Complex Test Safety office representative. The decision to conduct an SRB is based primarily
 20                                                               AFTCI91-203 30 APRIL 2014


on the test plan size, complexity, maturity of test item/methodology, and expected risk level. To
the maximum extent possible, independent safety reviewers chosen for the SRB should be the
same individuals that served as independent reviewers for the technical review. This is to ensure
continuity of information regarding test methodology is preserved throughout the review and
approval process and should result in a more insightful and thorough SRB.
5.4. Combined TRB/SRB. For those tests that are easily understood, less complex, or lower in
risk, the test team may request a combined TRB/SRB in lieu of separate technical and safety
reviews to minimize impact to resources and shorten the timeline. Teams should contact the Test
Safety office for final determination on this course of action. Teams will ensure that the test plan
is sufficiently mature for safety review prior to the combined TRB/SRB.
5.5. Electronic Safety Review. The Electronic Safety Review is a formal safety review of test
packages by independent safety reviewers, to include the Test Safety office that occurs without a
meeting. The test package is typically distributed electronically and reviewed in parallel by the
safety reviewers. An Electronic Safety Review is appropriate when test activities are readily
understood by reviewers, tend to be less complex, and are lower in risk.
5.6. NEGLIGIBLE Risk Review. A Negligible Risk Review (NRR) is a streamlined technical
and safety review process applicable to a subset of low risk tests. Resultant test hazards cannot
have severities greater than “negligible” or probabilities greater than “Occasional” (See Figure
3.1, Risk Assessment Matrix). Test activities that are normal, routine, and operationally
representative are also candidates for an NRR process since the risk is effectively the same as the
operational risk.
   5.6.1. NRR Qualification. NRR qualification of a test program should be proposed by the
   test team to the Wing or Complex Test Safety office who will make the final determination
   based on the following criteria:
       5.6.1.1. The risk level for the test activity must be assessed as negligible and fall within
       the hashed blocks in the Risk Assessment Matrix, (see Figure 3.1). Examples of these
       activities are listed in Paragraph 3.5.2.
       5.6.1.2. Testing will adhere to normal operating procedures and existing risk control
       measures as defined in the approved flight manual(s), technical orders, test facility
       procedures, and/or operational guidance/instructions (e.g. Air Force Instructions, Air
       Force Materiel Command Instructions, and Air Force Test Center Instructions).
       5.6.1.3. GMPs are allowed only to the extent that they clarify or further restrict already
       existing guidance. If the test team or reviewers identify test unique hazards that warrant a
       Test Hazard Analysis document, then the NRR process is not appropriate.
       5.6.1.4. Routine and existing aircrew/operator training, qualification, and proficiency are
       sufficient to perform the test activity, test or maneuver.
       5.6.1.5. Test procedures do not involve the use of abnormal or emergency procedures,
       checklists or configurations.
       5.6.1.6. For flight test, the SUT has no airworthiness impact, such that a failure or
       malfunction of the SUT would cause the use of abnormal or emergency procedures to
       safely recover the aircraft.
   5.6.2. NRR documentation will be located in the Safety Annex to the Test Plan.
AFTCI91-203 30 APRIL 2014                                                                21


  5.6.3. Each Wing/Complex may define a NEGLIGIBLE Risk Review and approval process
  in a local supplement to this instruction. If defined locally, the NRR process will comply
  with NRR qualification guidance in this Chapter and the approval coordination path defined
  in Table 6.1.
 22                                                               AFTCI91-203 30 APRIL 2014

                             TEST SAFETY APPROVAL PHASE

6.1. Approval Authorities and Notification Levels. All activities conducted in accordance
with paragraph 1.6 require approval before beginning execution. The approval phase provides
appropriate leadership the opportunity to make an informed risk acceptance and test approval
decision based on the safety review and risk assessment completed in the safety review phase.
The Test Execution Authority (TEA) for these activities is based on the proposed risk level as
outlined in Table 6.1. Approval is defined as permission to conduct or participate in the test
program or activity granted by the appropriate TEA. The TEA may require a Test Approval
Brief (TAB) to assist in making an informed decision. Signature of the TEA on AFTC Form
5001, Test Project Safety Review, constitutes acceptance of the risk and approval to begin
activities under the conditions set forth in the test package. A signed safety package does not
authorize deviation from Air Force, AFMC, or AFTC instructions or directives.

6.2. Delegation. When approval authority is delegated to a lower organization level, the
approval coordination path in Table 6.1 is still followed but with an info copy sent to the original
approving authority. Signature delegation will be no lower than the applicable deputy/vice
commander.
6.3. LOW Risk Activities.
   6.3.1. The Group CC (or equivalent) is the TEA for approval to execute all low-risk test
   events. However, final approval to execute low risk test may be delegated in writing to the
   Squadron CC (or equivalent) in compliance with AFI 91-202 as supplemented by AFMC.
   6.3.2. NEGLIGIBLE Risk activities, as defined in Paragraph 3.5, are a subset of LOW Risk
   and may be approved no lower than the Squadron CC (or equivalent). If the Squadron CC is
   unavailable for approval, NEGLIGIBLE Risk activities default to LOW Risk approval
   requirements.
AFTCI91-203 30 APRIL 2014                                                                     23


6.4. Elevated Risk Activities. Elevated risk activities are those that result in a residual risk
level of MEDIUM or HIGH. Example elevated risk activities are provided in Section 3.7 but are
not limited to activities on this list.
   6.4.1. MEDIUM Risk Test Approval. The Group CC (or equivalent) is the TEA for
   approval to execute all MEDIUM risk test events.
   6.4.2. HIGH Risk Test Approval.
       6.4.2.1. The AFTC/CC is the TEA for all HIGH risk test events. Final approval to
       execute HIGH risk test may be delegated in writing to the Wing or Complex CC.
       6.4.2.2. If non-AFTC assets/personnel are involved, the asset owner must be notified of
       the high residual risk prior to test execution. Notification method will be established in
       local supplements.
       6.4.2.3. HQ AFMC/SE/A3 must be notified of high risk tests prior to execution in
       accordance with AFI 91-202 AFMC Sup para 13.3.4.6. AFTC/SE will send this
       notification in conjunction with HIGH risk safety plan approval. Wing/Complex Safety
       offices will inform AFTC/SE when HIGH risk packages have been approved if TEA has
       been delegated to Wing or Complex CC level.
6.5. Test Approval Brief. The TEA or any other Commander on the Approval Coordination
Path may require a Test Approval Brief to assist in making an informed decision. A TAB should
be an executive level meeting that provides a test program overview and highlights test unique
hazards, mitigation procedures, discussion points during the independent review, and any
contention or disagreement by the independent board and the test team. The TAB may be
combined with an SRB if the TEA is in attendance.
6.6. Acceptance of Safety Planning across AFTC.
   6.6.1. An AFTC test program which has been approved through an AFTC test
   wing/complex’s technical and safety review processes may be executed by a different,
   supporting, AFTC test wing/complex.
   6.6.2. The originating test wing will notify the supporting wing when the technical and
   safety review processes are complete and the test program is approved for execution. The
   originating test wing will provide the supporting wing with test and safety planning
   documentation required under the originating test wing processes. The supporting wing may
   accept this documentation as written, or may request additional safety or test review
   following their own wing supplement to this instruction. Differences will be resolved by
   equivalent TEAs from each wing. The supporting wing may then execute any assigned
   portion of a test program which has been approved to execute under the originating test wing
   processes.
   6.6.3. Test execution materials (e.g. test cards or mission decks) may be developed by either
   the originating or supporting test wing. The organization creating the mission materials will
   adhere to local guidance for formatting, content and approval. Mission materials will be
   approved by the executing organization in accordance with their local procedures.

                                             Chapter 7

                                 TEST EXECUTION PHASE

7.1. General. The procedures, restrictions, and mitigations documented in the Safety Plan must
be observed while conducting the test in order to maintain the accepted level of risk. Safety Plan
requirements take precedence over those specified in the test plan. The safety plan is a contract
between the test team and senior leadership.
7.2. Test Card/Test Period Directive Preparation and Approval.
   7.2.1. Test Cards/Test Period Directives/etc. are documents describing the test activity
   procedures in a step-by-step or checklist format. These documents are used by test teams to
   successfully complete test activities. They may be reused for multiple test programs but
   should not be overly general in documentation. Inherently, they should be a synopsis of
   operation, test and/or manufacturing technical data immediately available to reference for the
   test team in executing test activities effectively, efficiently and safely.
   7.2.2. During test card or test period directive preparation, the test team will review
   applicable general minimizing procedures, test hazard analysis and Baseline Hazard Analysis
   to ensure the procedures comply with safety limits, procedural constraints or approved Test
   Plan requirements.
   7.2.3. Test execution procedures, whether documented in test cards or another format, must
   be approved prior to use during testing. Test card approval levels will be documented in
   local Wing/Complex instructions.
7.3. Test/Mission Execution Briefing. During the test/mission execution brief, the test team
will address the procedures and restrictions specified in the Safety Plan. As a minimum, all
general minimizing procedures, test hazard analyses and baseline hazard analyses applicable to
that particular test will be covered during the test briefing
7.4. Unusual Events. An “unusual event” or “unexpected test result” is any occurrence that
warrants a safety-related pause in the test program. If an unusual event occurs, the test team will
consult with the Wing or Complex Test Safety Office representative and associated test points
will be placed on hold. Once a recovery plan of action is determined, unusual events will
normally be documented with a safety plan amendment. Testing of the suspended test points
may be resumed upon approval of the appropriate change documentation, as described in
Chapter 8. Unusual events include, but are not limited to:
   7.4.1. Damage to the test article or support equipment.
   7.4.2. Exceeding safety of test limits.
   7.4.3. Unfavorable departure from predicted simulation/analysis.
   7.4.4. Occurrence of a THA/BHA hazard requiring corrective action.
   7.4.5. Occurrence of a hazard requiring corrective action not already mitigated by
   procedures defined in a THA/BHA form.
   7.4.6. Any lesson learned that needs to immediately pass to the entire test team.

                                            Chapter 8

                               CHANGES AND TIME LIMITS

8.1. Changes. It is not unusual for project changes to arise after receiving test approval.
Unexpected results, overly restrictive controls, hazards not previously identified or adequately
controlled, and changes in risk level all constitute reasonable grounds for changing safety
planning. All project changes will re-accomplish the following test safety review process
phases: safety planning, safety review, and approval. However, the scope of each phase may
differ significantly from that of an original safety plan, depending on the changes and
documentation method used.
8.2. Major Changes. Any potential change in risk level (higher or lower), major test plan
change, changes to safety planning, and unusual events are considered major changes that affect
test conduct or safety planning. Major changes require additional safety planning, independent
safety review, and approval before continued testing with these changes incorporated.
   8.2.1. Risk Level Change. During the course of testing, information may be obtained that
   potentially warrants a change in risk level. This could be an increase in the risk based on
   unexpected results or a decrease in risk level due to increased system maturity.
       8.2.1.1. The approval authority for an increase in risk level will be based on the “new”
       risk level IAW Chapter 6 (i.e. an upward change to HIGH risk requires AFTC/CC
       approval if not already delegated).
       8.2.1.2. The approval authority for a decrease in risk level will be based on the “original”
       risk level IAW Chapter 6 (i.e. a downward change from HIGH risk requires AFTC/CC
       approval if not already delegated).
   8.2.2. Major Test Plan Change. The definition of major test plan change will be outlined in
   local supplements. Generally, substantive changes to test objectives, technical approach, or
   test procedures will also require an amendment to safety planning as defined in the Safety
   Annex. Individuals performing the final safety review should be the same as those from the
   original package, if available. For multi-discipline test plans, only the discipline(s) affected
   by the amendment need to be included for review along with an operations representative.
   8.2.3. Change to Safety Planning. Any change to content of the safety plan is considered a
   change to safety planning. The desired changes could be more restrictive or less restrictive
   than the approved safety planning.
   8.2.4. Unusual Event. Safety plan documentation following an unusual event should
   describe the occurrence of the event, summarize the cause(s) as they are understood by either
   analysis or hypothesis, and identify the test team’s intended path for the resumption of
   testing.
8.3. Minor and Administrative Changes. Some changes to the approved test package may be
classified as minor or administrative only and will be defined in local supplements. Minor test
plan changes may include changing the flight conditions of test points, adding test points
(provided the new conditions are within the approved envelope of test points), or deleting test
points that are not a part of safety build-up. An administrative change to the test package
clarifies information contained in the package and does not affect test conduct or safety planning.

Locally approved procedures for documenting and approving minor or administrative changes
may be defined in supplements to this instruction. The test unit commander (or equivalent) may
be the approval authority for any changes not defined as Major Changes in Section 7.2.
8.4. Time Limit. Safety plans will be reviewed at least every three years. Baseline Safety
Reports and USAF Test Pilot School standard curriculum event safety plans will be reviewed at
least every four years. Teams will identify any new risks and mitigation plans; highlight key
issues experienced since approval or the last review; and purge non-applicable guidance from the
plan. Teams will document reviews on an AFTC Form 5001 in accordance with Chapter 6.

Acceptable Risk— That part of identified risk which is allowed by the managing activity to
persist without further engineering or management action.
 28                                                                AFTCI91-203 30 APRIL 2014


Baseline Hazard Analyses (BHA)— An analysis used to document known hazards concerned
with the normal day-to-day operation and maintenance of a test system, subsystem or ground test
facility.
Baseline Safety Report (BSR)— A compilation of BHAs that constitute the hazards associated
with the specific operation of a test system, subsystem or ground test facility and includes a BHA
for all systems to be operated or maintained. The BSR allows the individual hazard analyses that
make up the baseline to be evaluated in a comprehensive package and thus shows the interaction
of the systems and interfaces.
Control/Safety Measure— An action taken to eliminate or reduce a potential test hazard to an
acceptable risk level.
Deviation— The intent of the requirement is not met and a waiver must be approved through the
appropriate authority.
General Minimizing Procedure— Statements that direct a specific action or procedure that
mitigates general test execution risk; these generally include the words “will” or “shall”. GMPs
are used to address test article restrictions, test build-up, critical parameter monitoring, go-no-go
criteria, weather or environmental criteria, and flight test chase requirements among other items
of test safety concern.
Hazard— Any real or potential condition that can cause injury, illness, or death to personnel;
damage to or loss of a system, equipment or property; or damage to the environment. It is the
threat of harm and is a precursor state to a mishap.
Identified Risk— That risk which has been determined through various analysis techniques.
Independent Review— A review by an individual or group that does not have a vested interest
in the successful accomplishment of the test objectives and was not directly responsible for the
development of the safety plan.
Mishap— An unplanned event or series of events resulting in death, injury, occupational illness,
or damage to or loss of equipment or property, or damage to the environment.
Residual Risk— The remaining mishap risk that exists after all mitigation techniques have been
implemented or exhausted, in accordance with the system safety design order of precedence.
Risk Assessment Consensus— Unanimous agreement by the safety reviewers on the overall
risk assessment. Less than unanimous agreement must be documented in the Final Safety
Review Memorandum.
Risk Level— An expression of the danger posed by a hazard in terms of the severity of outcome
and the probability of occurrence. Risk = Severity x Probability. Risk levels are assigned to both
a test event and the test as a whole.
Risk Management (RM)— The systematic process of identifying threats/hazards/problems,
assessing risk, analyzing risk control options and measures, making control decisions,
implementing control decisions, accepting residual risks, and supervising/reviewing the activity
for effectiveness.
Safety Annex— The safety annex is part of the test plan where all safety planning
documentation (i.e. the safety plan) is located.
AFTCI91-203 30 APRIL 2014                                                                        29


Safety Plan— Safety documentation that details the specific safety criteria and parameters to
allow safe conduct of a test. The safety plan can identify targets, munitions, aircraft, and other
equipment to used; defines danger areas; identifies the potential hazards associated with the test;
and establishes the specific safety requirements necessary to conduct the test, such as special
handling, flight termination systems, surveillance requirements, communication requirements,
etc.
Safety Review Board— A formal safety review meeting chaired by Wing or Complex Chief of
Test Safety or delegate and consisting of independent reviewers as voting members. The
meeting is also supported by appropriate project personnel. The product of an SRB is an
independently reviewed safety plan and proposed overall risk level of the test for consideration
by the TEA.
Safety Reviewers— An independent panel of subject knowledgeable individuals that review the
test and associated safety plan to ensure test hazards are identified; then eliminated, minimized
or controlled to an acceptable level; and to establish the overall risk level. As a safety reviewer,
the individual is acting on behalf of the AFTC senior leadership. As a minimum, the safety
reviewer panel will be composed of a technical and operations representative who will review
the test package. Technical representatives are chosen based on their experience and expertise in
the engineering discipline(s) associated with the test activity to be reviewed. Operations
representatives are chosen based on their test and operations experience in similar test activities.
Senior Leadership— Collective reference to the various Operations Group, Test Wing, Test
Complex, and AFTC authorities who coordinate, approve, and review test packages.
Test and Evaluation (T&E)—The act of generating empirical data during the research,
development or sustainment of systems, and the creation of information through analysis that is
useful to technical personnel and decision makers for reducing design and acquisition risks. The
process by which systems are measured against requirements and specifications, and the results
analyzed so as to gauge progress and provide feedback.
Test Execution Authority (TEA)— Senior leader who approves the test package.
Test Hazard Analysis (THA)— A document that identifies test hazards, causes, and effects and
establishes controls which are used to determine risk level. For AFTC test programs, test hazard
analysis will be documented on an AFTC Form 5000.
Test Organization/Unit— The organization or unit providing the test facilities, equipment or
personnel to conduct a test. The test article may or may not be a resource of the test
organization/unit. Also known as the test executing organization (TEO).
Test Organization/Unit Commander— The highest ranking individual at the test organization
or unit (commander or director). This individual has responsibility for the personnel, equipment
and/or facilities for accomplishing the test, and is the individual responsible for reporting
mishaps involving the test article or the facilities.
Test Package— As a minimum, the test package includes the test plan, safety plan, and any
other appendices or documentation that support the test planning.
Test Plan— The test plan describes the system under test, defines the test objectives and outlines
the test methodology in sufficient detail to demonstrate technical adequacy and execute a
technically effective test program.

Test Safety— The application of engineering and management principles, criteria, and
techniques to optimize all aspects of safety within the constraints of operational effectiveness,
time and cost throughout the defined test cycle.
Test Safety Office— The division in the safety office that reports directly to the Chief of Safety
and is responsible for the implementation and management of the locally developed test safety
review process.
Test Unique Hazards— Hazards that are a result of the specific test being accomplished and not
present in the normal operational hazards associated with the system or environment. These
hazards include those inherent to the article being tested as well as those hazards associated with
the initial testing of any new system.
Unacceptable Risk— That risk which cannot be tolerated by the managing activity. It is a
subset of identified risk. Unacceptable risk is either eliminated or controlled.
Variation— The intent of the requirement is expected to be met.
Waiver— Approval from the appropriate authority to deviate from both the intent and the letter
of the requirement.
