from 49 WG/SE within 30 days after appointment. The unit is responsible for maintaining USR
training records.

SharePoint site.
3.1. General. 49 WG/SE will accomplish a combined annual unit assessment and inspection.
Ground USRs will conduct an annual unit self-assessment. These assessments and inspections
will be scheduled on a Calendar Year (CY) basis by 49 WG/SE with unit input. Unit self-
assessments should be planned to be accomplished six months following an annual unit
inspection. The WG inspection schedule will include special and seasonal inspections.
3.1.1. (Added) Unit self-assessments will utilize AFIA Safety checklists within the
Management Internal Control Toolset (MICT). Units should determine which “Wing+Below”
checklists are appropriate for their units. Unit commanders may add additional inspection items
as they see fit. USRs will prepare a written report documenting the overall results of their self-
assessment. This report will be endorsed by the unit commander, and be provided to 49 WG/SE
within 30 days of the self-assessment. USRs are responsible for all findings and will provide 49
WG/SE with a follow-up status every 30 days until the finding is closed. A work order does not
close an open discrepancy. Completion of applicable work orders will close a finding. 49
WG/SE will conduct a follow-up spot inspection once the unit closes an item. The schedule for
conducting follow-up spot inspections will be coordinated between SE and the unit, to allow for
multiple items to be inspected simultaneously.
3.4. Annual Safety Inspections. Annual Safety Inspections will utilize an overall three-tier
rating system when assessing the unit’s program management: Outstanding, Satisfactory, and
Unsatisfactory. Each applicable program management area will be scored using a five-tier rating
system, ranging from 0 (program nonexistent) to 4 (program exceeds requirements). Individual
program scores will be divided by the total number of graded areas to determine the final rating.
3.5.1.1. (Added) At a minimum, each unit will accomplish and document one spot inspection
per week, per discipline. This spot inspection should be accomplished by the unit’s primary
USR, SAFSO, and UWSR, but may be accomplished by an alternate. Findings will be
forwarded to 49 WG/SEG, 49 WG/SEF, or 49th Wing Weapons Safety (49 WG/SEW), as
appropriate, to be tracked until closure. 100% of workplaces within each unit will be inspected
annually. It is the unit’s responsibility to identify and track workplaces to ensure this
requirement is met.
3.5.1.2. (Added) At a minimum, 49 WG/SEG, 49 WG/SEF, and 49 WG/SEW personnel will
each accomplish one spot inspection per week. One spot inspection per month of each discipline
will be accomplished outside of normal duty hours (0730-1630). All High Interest Items (HIIs)
will be inspected at least once per week, and may count as a weekly spot inspection.
