(AFRC) The success of Air Force Reserve programs and mission depends on Congressional
support. Therefore, effective communication with Congress is essential. It is important that we as
representatives of the Air Force Reserve increase Congressional awareness of the Air Force
Reserve’s role in our national security. This supplement implements and extends the guidance of
AFI 90-401. It explains responsibilities and procedures of Air Force Reserve Command and
reserve component members for maintaining effective relationships with Congress to include
preocedures for inviting and conducting visits by members of Congress as established in AFI 90-
401. This supplement does not apply to the Air National Guard (ANG). Ensure that all records
created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained IAW Air Force

updated statement provided by the AF Records Management office (SAF/CIO A6P). Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route
AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional chain of command. This
publication may be supplemented at any level, but all direct Supplements must be routed to the
OPR of this publication for coordination prior to certification and approval. The authorities to
waive wing/unit level requirements in this publication are identified with a Tier number (“T-0,

Management, for a description of the authorities associated with the Tier numbers. Requests for
waivers must be processed through command channels to the appropriate Tier waiver approval
authority, or alternately, to the publication OPR for non-tiered compliance items. (T-1).

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This is the third publication of AFI 90-401. The initial publication superseded AFR 11-7, 22
December

1983, eliminating the requirement to file reports for congressional committee investigations,
hearings, or visits. This revision establishes the Office of Legislative Liaison, Congressional
Action Division, SAF/ LLZ, as the OPR to provide support to wing commanders during visits
with members of Congress and their staffs. SAF/LLZ will provide support to wing commanders
in coordination with the Office of Bud- get and Appropriations Liaison, SAF/FMBL, as
appropriate. This document also establishes the appropriate routing for Congressional
Correspondence. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office
of Primary responsibility (OPR), SAF/LLZ, using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for
Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through the Major Command
(MAJCOM) publications/forms managers. Ensure all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN)

                                            Chapter 1

                                RELEASING INFORMATION

1.1. Classified Information. Air Force personnel must properly safeguard classified
information in the interests of national defense (according to DoD 5200.1-R, Department of
Defense Information Security Program Regulation, with Change 1 and AFI 31-401, Information
Security Program Management). In accordance with DoDI 5230.29 and DoDI 5400.04,
Prepared Statements, Transcripts, QFRs, IFRs, Advance Policy Questions, Selected Acquisition
Reports, and Budget Documents will be submitted to the DoD Office of Security Review for
security and policy review with the consent of the Secretary of the Air Force before going to
Congress. The Secretary has designated the Security and Policy Review office (SAF/PA) as the
approval authority for release of Air Force classified information to the Congress. Refer
congressional requests for classified information to SAF/PA through SAF/LL or SAF/FMBL.
Air Force officials may not disclose classified information to the Congress for release to a
congressional constituent.
1.2. "For Official Use Only" Information. According to DoD 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302,
Freedom of Information Act Program, Air Force officials may generally not disclose For Official
Use Only (FOUO) information to the public that falls within exemptions 2 through 9 of the
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). However, the Air Force may release such information to
chairpersons or ranking members of congressional committees or subcommittees if the
information relates to matters within their jurisdiction. An Air Force official who decides the
information should not be released to the congressional committee must staff the congressional
request for information with a recommendation to the Secretary of the Air Force through
SAF/LL or SAF/FMBL as appropriate. Requests from Members of Congress not seeking
records on behalf of a Congressional Committee, Subcommittee, either House sitting as a whole,
or made on behalf of their constituents shall be considered the same as any other requester.
1.3. Privacy Act Information. Air Force officials must protect personal information about
military and civilian employees according to the guidelines of the Privacy Act. Without an
individual’s written consent to release information, Air Force officials may provide only general
information according to the provisions of AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Program which sets
forth the Privacy Act procedures. The Air Force may, however, disclose an individual’s records
without the individual’s consent when requested by a chairperson or ranking member of a
congressional committee or subcommittee if the information relates to matters within their
jurisdiction. When making such a disclosure, the Air Force should tell the committee or
subcommittee members about any sensitive information and the need to safeguard it.
1.4. Information for Air Force Personnel. Air Force personnel have the legal right to petition,
furnish information to, or communicate with Congress (Title 5, United States Code, Section 7102
and Title 10, United States Code, Section 1034).
1.5. Locally Sensitive Information. Information on significant changes in the status of Air
Force units, installations, and industrial facilities may have an impact on states and congressional
districts. Therefore, Air Force officials must not release any information governed by AFI 10-
503, Strategic Basing, September 27, 2010, without the proper authorization. For any other
information not governed by AFI-10-503 basing actions concerning changes in status of AF
units, installations, and industrial facilities that might have an impact (positive or negative) on
AFI90-401_AFRCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2014                                                            7


the local community/congressional district; local commanders should check with SAF/LL or
SAF/FMBL prior to release.
1.6. Congressional Security Clearances and Special Access. Per OSD Policy, Congressional
Member clearances are automatic once the Member is elected into their current position in the
United States Senate or U.S. House of Representatives. Once a Member is elected as a seated
member of Congress, the Member is automatically read into SCI and any other classification
needed. To verify the security clearance and special access information of congressional staff
members, contact the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Legislative Affairs Security Office
(OSD/LA), or SAF/LL Security for proper direction.
   1.6.1. In accordance with Hamre, John, J., Memo to the Honorable Jerry Lewis, United
   States House of Representatives, Washington D.C., 22 June 1999, “Members of Congress
   assigned to the defense committees (and to the intelligence committees only for intelligence
   SAPs) are accessed to all DoD SAPs, except for a limited number of programs judged to be
   of extreme sensitivity, referred to as waived SAPs.
   1.6.2. Acting on behalf of the Chairman and the Ranking Member, only the Majority and
   Minority Staff Directors will granted access to waived SAPs. Chairmen and Ranking
   Members may request the Deputy Secretary of Defense to grant exception to this restriction
   on a case by case basis.
   1.6.3. Access to non-waived SAPs by professional staff members of the defense and
   intelligence committees will be determined by the Staff Director and the Minority Staff
   Director, respectively, on behalf of the Chairman and Ranking Member. Accesses will be
   coordinated with the Defense Department’s Special Access Program Coordination Office
   (SAPCO) to ensure compliance with personnel security requirements.
   1.6.4. Members of Congress not assigned to the defense committees (and to the intelligence
   committees only for intelligence SAPs) will be granted access to DoD SAPs (non-waived
   SAPs only) with the concurrence of the DoD after consultation with the Chairman and
   Ranking Member of the defense committees.
   1.6.5. The personal staff of a Member of Congress shall not be granted access to DoD SAPs.
1.7. Industry and Contract Information. Information concerning contractor proprietary
information must be safe-guarded. Special care must be exercised when releasing information
during the source selection process. Proper use of non-disclosure statements must be exercised.

                                HQ USAF RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. Congress is a critical partner with the United States Air Force. The Air Force works
with Congress to ensure Airmen are properly organized, trained, and equipped to conduct the
range of missions the Nation expects and needs. Therefore, open and honest dialogue with
members of Congress and their staffs is encouraged at all levels of the Air Force.

invitation to Members of Congress. Call the Air Force Congressional Inquiry Division
(SAF/LLI) for the best way to extend the invitation to the Executive Office of the President or
the Office of the Vice President.
   6.4.1. MAJCOM/CCs may extend invitations to members and their staffs to join them on a
   planned base visit in their respective Congressional district. These invitations must not

   employees, or spouses in the invitation.
       6.4.1.1. (Added-AFRC) Invitations may be for specific events or an open invitation at
       the MOC’s convenience (Attachment 4). As per 6.4.1, an invitation will not offer

     6.4.1.6. (Added-AFRC) Visit suggestions: Whenever possible, use “hands-on”
     demonstrations rather than formal briefings to display unit mission capabilities. Avoid
     long detailed briefings that focus on the "nuts and bolts" of daily operations; this kind of
     information is better provided in fact sheets. Briefings should emphasize the AFR
     mission, the organizational specific mission, economic impact, number of jobs provided,
     dollar value of hardware and real estate, highlights of local Reservists who are prominent
     in the community, and any current issue that may have a direct impact on your
     organization.Finally, always provide honest answers and do not promise anything you
     can’t deliver.

   briefings, transportation, quarters, or other support.
   6.5.2. For unescorted trips, the host commander should inform SAF/LL or SAF/FMBL about
   the outcome of the visit or investigation. Field commanders should also provide information
   to other interested echelons at their discretion.

      PROPOSED RESPONSE FOR SENATOR/REPRESENTATIVE JOHN SMITH
             REGARDING MASTER SERGEANT STEVEN SNUFFY

        This is the template for completing a congressional inquiry response. All responses are
to be submitted in Microsoft Word with one inch margins all around. Font will be Times New
Roman size 12. Paragraphs are double spaced, left justified, and indented.
When using acronyms spell out the phrase on the first use; followed by the acronym in
parenthesis. For example: Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). Do not abbreviate military
rank in your response. For example, never use TSgt or Lt Col; use Technical
Sergeant/Lieutenant Colonel in the heading and first paragraph; all subsequent use should be
Sergeant or Colonel.
Ensure all dates adhere to the following example: March 21, 2013; do not abbreviate the month.
The first time you reference a form or Air Force Instruction it should follow this format: Defense
Department (DD) Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty / Air Force
Instruction (AFI) 36-2905, Fitness Program. All subsequent references can be abbreviated as
DD Form 214 and AFI 36-2905.
Begin the response by identifying the individual and their concern(s). The following is an
example of the correct format:
This is in reply to your inquiry on behalf of Master Sergeant Steven Snuffy, who requested your
assistance regarding the correct format for submitting an inquiry response.
Sergeant Snuffy is an Air Force Reservist assigned to the 111th Airlift Wing, 100th Aerial Port
Squadron (100 APS), Chennault Air Force Base (AFB), Louisiana. As a member of the Air
Force Reserve (AFR), it is Sergeant Snuffy’s desire to have an accurate understanding of how to
respond to a congressional inquiry.
Do not change the response to a letter or memo format. The response must have an organized
and chronological flow answering all questions/issues referenced in the constituent’s letter.
Remember your audience; responses are written to the congressional member so maintain a
neutral tone and ensure your response is accurate and complete. Finally, if a valid problem has
been identified, acknowledge it and indicate what corrective action has been implemented.
The response should always end with – We trust this information is helpful.
