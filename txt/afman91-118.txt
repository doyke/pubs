                          GENERAL STANDARDS AND CONTROL

Section 1A—Responsibility and Scope

1.1. Department of Defense (DoD) Safety Standards. The DoD Nuclear Weapon System
Safety Standards form the basis for the safety design and evaluation criteria for nuclear weapon
systems. The DoD Nuclear Weapon System Safety Standards state that:
   1.1.1. There shall be positive measures to prevent nuclear weapons involved in accidents or
   incidents or jettisoned weapons, from producing a nuclear yield.
   1.1.2. There shall be positive measures to prevent DELIBERATE prearming, arming,
   launching or releasing of nuclear weapons, except upon execution of emergency war orders
   or when directed by competent authority.
   1.1.3. There shall be positive measures to prevent INADVERTENT prearming, arming,
   launching or releasing of nuclear weapons in all normal and credible abnormal environments.
   1.1.4. There shall be positive measures to ensure adequate security of nuclear weapons,
   pursuant to DoDD O-5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons.
1.2. Air Force Criteria. To comply with the DoD safety standards, the Air Force has
implemented a set of minimum design and evaluation criteria for their nuclear weapon systems.
These criteria do not invalidate the safety requirements in other DoD publications, but Air Force
activities are required to apply the more stringent criteria. Since the criteria in this manual are not
design solutions and are not intended to restrict the designer in the methods and techniques used
to meet operational design requirements, they are not all-inclusive. Air Force nuclear weapon
system designers may add feasible and reasonable safety features as needed. Refer to AFI 63-125
for nuclear certification procedures.

Section 1B—Deviations to Criteria

1.3. Request for Deviation. If the design of an Air Force nuclear weapon system does not meet
the requirements contained in this manual, a deviation request shall be obtained according to the
requirements of AFI 91-107, Design, Evaluation, Troubleshooting, and Maintenance Criteria for
Nuclear Weapon Systems. Exceptions to this manual, as evidenced by some current and older
designs, do not constitute a precedent to deviate from the criteria.
1.4. Currency of Standards and Guidance. Standards and guidance referenced in this
document are current as of the date of publication. In the event of cancellation or modification
of the referenced standards or guidance, contact AFSC/SEWN for requirements.

1.5. Existing Systems. Existing systems are not required to be modified solely to meet new or
changed requirements in this manual. If an existing system is modified, the modified system
shall meet new requirements established through guidance or standards as referenced in
attachment 1. Deviations if the design of a modified system is not expected to meet the
requirements contained in this manual, shall be obtained according to the requirements of AFI
91-107, Design, Evaluation, Troubleshooting, and Maintenance Criteria for Nuclear Weapon
Systems.

                                           Chapter 2

               DESIGN CRITERIA FOR NUCLEAR WEAPON SYSTEMS

Section 2A—General Philosophy and Criteria

2.1. Nuclear Weapon Safety Design Philosophy. The Department of Energy (DOE) designs
nuclear weapon safety devices to withstand credible abnormal environments for a longer time
than the weapon’s critical arming components or until the weapon is physically incapable of
providing a nuclear detonation. The design of Air Force nuclear weapon systems shall consider
these DOE nuclear weapon safety design concepts:
   2.1.1. Exclusion Region. This region contains the firing set and weapon detonator system. It
   also has the necessary packaging and safety devices to exclude functional energy, for other
   than intended use, from the firing set and weapon detonator system.
   2.1.2. Strong Links. Safety devices (such as system prearm devices and environmental or
   trajectory sensing devices) called strong links permit the transmission of functional energy to
   the firing set for the arming and firing signals (following the receipt of the appropriate unique
   signal information sequence at the appropriate time) and provide threat energy isolation in an
   abnormal environment. Functional energy includes the proper energy type(s) and level(s),
   which are required to achieve the intended functional operation of the weapon (i.e.,
   significant nuclear yield). Threat energy encompasses unintended temporal patterns of
   energy type(s) and level(s) that can lead to an unintended state of the weapon up to and
   including unintentional significant nuclear yield.
   2.1.3. Weak Links. A weak link is a selected functional unit (such as a capacitor or
   transformer) vital to operating the firing set and weapon detonator system and whose
   function is not likely to be duplicated or bypassed. Weak links respond predictably to certain
   levels and types of abnormal environments by becoming irreversibly inoperable and thus
   rendering the system inoperable at levels less than those at which the strong links fail to keep
   energy isolation. Weak links and strong links are collocated so as to experience essentially
   the same environment at the same time.
2.2. Nuclear Weapon System Safety Design Philosophy. The guidance in this chapter is for
use by Air Force and Air Force contracted designers and evaluators. Air Force nuclear weapon
system designs implement critical function control to provide adequate protection against
premature detonation of a nuclear weapon in both normal and credible abnormal environments.
   2.2.1. Critical Function Control Concepts. Criteria for adequately controlling some critical
   functions depend on the specific nuclear safety design concept of the weapon system. Older
   nuclear weapons and weapon systems use the energy control (or removal) concept or the
   information control concept. Many currently deployed systems use the information control
   concept or a combination of both concepts.
       2.2.1.1. Energy Control Concept. The energy control concept involves limiting the entry
       of threat energy into the weapon system devices that control the operation of the critical
       functions. Critical functions are designed to require functional energy signal(s) for
       operation. Reliability requires that the weapon system respond as intended when the
       functional energy signal(s) are present at the weapon interface. Therefore, safety levels
10                                                           AFMAN91-118 4 AUGUST 2010


     (IAW AFI 91-107) of weapon systems using this design concept depend on the safety
     controls that block application of those functional energy signal(s) to the weapon
     interface until the controls are properly removed.
     2.2.1.2. Information Control Concept. Critical prearm functions are commanded by a
     unique signal that provides indication of an unambiguous human intent to detonate the
     weapon. Safety levels depend upon the uniqueness of a carefully designed sequence of
     bi-valued events and are evaluated based on the assumptions of worst-case power levels.
     Worst-case power levels involve temporal patterns of energy type(s) and level(s) needed
     to transmit bi-valued events which can be discriminated by the strong link and can lead to
     an unintended establishment of the transmission path through the strong link barrier that
     allows passage of either functional or threat energy.
  2.2.2. Critical Functions. These functions are critical:
     2.2.2.1. Authorization. The weapon system shall have one or more devices to control
     authorization to use the weapon. These devices shall prevent prearming or arming (or
     both) of a nuclear bomb or warhead in aircraft-carried weapons and the launch of a
     ground-launched missile until authorization to prepare to use the weapon is received
     through the command and control system. Examples of these controls are the enable
     device in the Minuteman weapon system and the permissive action link (PAL) in many
     nuclear bombs.
         2.2.2.1.1. The authorization device, which meets the numerical requirements
         specified in AFI 91-107, for protection against unauthorized actions, shall operate on
         the information control concept. A secure method shall provide the information
         through command and control channels.
         2.2.2.1.2. The system shall have built-in positive design features to prevent
         inadvertent operation of the data entry control. The positive features shall protect
         against inadvertent operation of the authorization device and an attack on or bypass of
         the device. The system design shall reveal any attack on or bypass of the device. If
         remotely monitored, the weapon system operators or control point shall receive an
         attack or bypass indication. The indication (local, remote or local and remote) shall be
         latching (remains actuated until reset by authorized personnel) and shall be protected
         from the attacker to prevent reset.
         2.2.2.1.3. The authorization device shall not prevent any safing or relocking function,
         regardless of the state of the authorization device.
     2.2.2.2. Prearming. The prearm command provides an unambiguous indication of human
     intent to the weapon that the weapon system operators want it to function as designed and
     produce a nuclear detonation. Once commanded to the prearm state and presented with
     proper arming stimuli, the weapon shall arm. The weapon system design shall keep the
     prearming function separate and independent from the authorization function. Weapon
     design features shall preclude prearming in the absence of the prearm command signal
     and prevent bypass of any prearming device that would permit arming without
     prearming.
         2.2.2.2.1. For weapons whose design is based on the information control concept, use
         uniquely coded prearm command signals. The information needed to generate the
AFMAN91-118 4 AUGUST 2010                                                                    11


        unique signal shall be physically unavailable to the unique signal generator until its
        use is required.
        2.2.2.2.2. For weapons whose design is based on the energy control concept,
        physically and electrically isolate the prearm command signal line from all other
        circuits. Avoid the use of common routing, cabling, or connectors with the prearm
        command signal line and any wire likely to carry enough power to operate the prearm
        device. Give special design consideration to credible abnormal environments.
     2.2.2.3. Launching. Operation of a rocket motor propulsion system (control of launch) is
     controlled through two independent functions: the ignition system arm or safe command
     and the ignition command. The weapon system shall have a safe and arm device or
     equivalent design to protect the ignition system. Without the arm command, propulsion
     system ignition shall not occur even if the ignition command is sent. Design features shall
     preclude accidental or deliberate unauthorized transmission of the arm and ignition
     commands. The design shall also prevent any failure from allowing bypass of the ignition
     safing device that would permit ignition when the device is safed.
     2.2.2.4. Releasing. Operation of the release system for aircraft-carried weapons is
     controlled through two independent functions: the release system unlock command and
     the release command. Without the unlock command, separation of the weapon from the
     combat delivery aircraft shall not occur even if the release command is sent. Design
     features shall preclude accidental transmission of unlock and release commands and shall
     also prevent any failure from allowing bypass of the lock device that would permit
     release of the weapon when the device is locked. Aircraft delivery system controls for
     release of guided weapons shall provide for the protection of friendly territory to the
     greatest extent possible (i.e., combination of system design features and procedural
     controls). For air-launched missiles, the ignition system arm and the release system
     unlock shall be separate and independent functions.
     2.2.2.5. Arming. If the weapon is prearmed, arming shall be the design response of the
     weapon to sensing that the environment is within the limits defined for operational use
     (after launch or release). Design features shall include measurements of the environment
     so environments other than "intended use" are discriminated against to the greatest extent
     possible. If a missile has self-contained guidance, include a good guidance signal (refer
     to paragraph 2.9.1.1) as a measurement of the proper operational environment. Bombs
     with self contained guidance shall include a good guidance signal prior to release as a
     measurement of the proper operational environment. Bombs with active self contained
     guidance** released from aircraft shall include a good guidance signal (refer to paragraph
     2.9.1.2) as a measurement of the proper operational environment. The armed condition
     allows the selected fuze signal (such as radar, contact or timer) to detonate the warhead.
     Design features shall preclude arming unless the proper operational environment is
     sensed; prevent erroneous transmission of the good guidance signal; and preclude bypass
     of the arming system that would permit nuclear detonation of the warhead without
     arming.
     2.2.2.6. Targeting. Targeting is a critical function for ground-launched missiles. It
     includes the preparation, weapon system processing, targeting data transmission to
     missile guidance, and arming and fuzing systems. Targeting data consists of the flight
 12                                                           AFMAN91-118 4 AUGUST 2010


       control and fuzing constants needed to deliver and detonate the weapon within the
       designated target area. The weapon system design shall prevent erroneous targeting
       functions and accidental or unauthorized changes to targeting data.
   2.2.3. Reversible Operations. Ensure the operation of devices for authorization, prearming,
   propulsion system ignition arming and aircraft release system unlocking is reversible.
   2.2.4. Targeting for air-delivered systems. Targeting is not a critical function for air-
   delivered systems. However, air delivered missiles or bombs with self contained guidance
   require positive measures as defined in AFI 91-101 to ensure the protection of friendly
   territory to the greatest extent possible. (refer to paragraphs 2.9.1 and 2.9.2).
2.3. Critical Function Numerical Requirements. The numerical requirements specified in
AFI 91-107 apply to ground-launched missile and combat delivery aircraft systems to show that,
in normal environments, the calculated probability of occurrence of inadvertent prearming,
launching, releasing or jettisoning, arming or erroneous targeting of nuclear weapons is unlikely
to occur during the system lifetime. Although numerical specifications for credible abnormal
environments are only defined for DOE nuclear bombs and warheads, Air Force nuclear weapon
system designers shall incorporate positive safety features for these environments into the design
of combat delivery vehicles to protect against inadvertent critical function activation.
2.4. Safety Features and Procedures. Ensure the nuclear safety features eliminate or minimize
the dependence of safety and security on administrative procedures.
2.5. Explosive Ordnance Disposal. Design aircraft and missile systems to permit emergency
access to those components and circuits required to carry out render-safe procedures. Develop
render-safe procedures with the intent of meeting the numerical requirements of AFI 91-107.
2.6. Physical and Internal Security. A physical security system shall prevent access to nuclear
weapons and protect critical equipment and secure data (refer to paragraph 1.1.4). Nuclear
weapon systems and nuclear weapons shall incorporate internal security features to prevent
unauthorized use (refer to paragraph 1.1.2).
2.7. Environmental Parameters. Consider nuclear safety design features over the full range of
normal and credible abnormal environments to which the system could be subjected. Since
specific normal and abnormal environmental parameters are system dependent, use the
parameters specified in the appropriate nuclear bomb and warhead Stockpile-to-Target Sequence
(STS) and Military Characteristics (MC) documents and in the weapon system specifications.
2.8. Safe and Arm (S&A) and Arm/Disarm (A/D) Devices. Ensure these devices meet the
design criteria in MIL-HDBK-1512, Electro-explosive Subsystems, Electrically Initiated, Design
Requirements and Test Methods. If the devices are electrically actuated, they shall arm only in
response to an externally generated unique signal. The safing signal shall differ from the arming
signal to reduce the risk of arming during attempted safing. If a monitor signal is used, it shall
also be different from the arming signal.
2.9. Protection of Friendly Territory. Design weapon systems to prevent nuclear detonations,
except within specified target boundaries.
   2.9.1. Good Guidance Signal:
       2.9.1.1. Missile systems and guided missiles launched from aircraft shall receive a good
       guidance signal from the guidance and control unit before nuclear warhead arming can
AFMAN91-118 4 AUGUST 2010                                                                        13


       occur. The good guidance signal shall be withheld if a final guidance accuracy check
       shows the weapon shall impact outside specified target boundaries.
       2.9.1.2. Bombs with self contained guidance shall incorporate a good guidance signal
       prior to release. Bombs with active self contained guidance shall also incorporate a good
       guidance signal for arming which shall be withheld if the weapon cannot be guided to
       detonate within specified target boundaries (refer to paragraph 2.9.2).
Active self contained guidance is defined as a weapon that has capability to update position and
navigate to the target.
   2.9.2. Target Boundaries. The boundaries for airborne release and delivery systems vary
   with the number of weapons, weapon yield and type, methods of use, geographical location
   and operational needs. Consequently, the DoD weapon system program managers, with
   coordination from the operating command and the appropriate nuclear safety evaluation
   agency, shall specify target boundaries.
2.10. Single Component Failure or Operation. Ensure the failure or accidental operation of a
single component does not result in authorization to use a nuclear weapon system, prearming,
launching or releasing of a nuclear weapon; or arming of a prearmed weapon. This criterion
applies before any of these functions are initiated or when more than one event remains in the
operational sequence leading to a function initiation.
2.11. Human Engineering. Design the system so no two independent human errors or acts
shall cause prearming, arming, launching or releasing of a nuclear weapon in an operational
weapon system or shall authorize the use of a ground-launched missile system. This criterion
applies only before initiation of actions required to complete the desired operation. The design
shall minimize the number of points within the system where human actions could degrade
nuclear safety or security. The design shall also stress positive measures to prevent deliberate
unauthorized or accidental operation of controls that could degrade nuclear safety or security.
2.12. Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Equipment.
   2.12.1. Non-specialized COTS. Non-specialized COTS equipment is nuclear safety design
   certified as prescribed in AFI 91-103, Air Force Nuclear Safety Design Certification
   Program.
   2.12.2. Integrated COTS Equipment/Item. COTS items that are used or integrated as part
   of an item that requires nuclear safety design certification as defined in AFI 91-103 (e.g.,
   multi-meters integrated as part of a certified tester, etc.) are considered specialized and shall
   be evaluated in accordance with this manual.

Section 2B—Automata, Software, Firmware and Hardware Generated Using Software

2.13. General Design Criteria. All automata, software, firmware and integrated circuits
generated using software that receives, stores, processes or transmits data to monitor, target,
prearm, arm, launch, release or authorize the use of a nuclear weapon shall comply with the
design and evaluation criteria specified in AFMAN 91-119, Safety Design and Evaluation
Criteria for Nuclear Weapon Systems Software. An example of an integrated circuit being
generated using software is the use of Very-High-Speed Integrated Circuits (VHSIC) Hardware
 14                                                            AFMAN91-118 4 AUGUST 2010


Description Language (VHDL) to design, simulate and synthesize an Application Specific
Integrated Circuit (ASIC).
   2.13.1. Circuitry Designed with Automated Tools. Critical circuitry designed with
   automated tools (e.g. synthesized from VHDL) shall be verified IAW AFMAN 91-119.
   2.13.2. Reprogrammable Circuitry. Reprogrammable circuitry (e.g. the contents of a Field
   Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA)) shall be protected IAW AFMAN 91-119.
   2.13.3. Circuits with Embedded Software.         Critical circuits with embedded software or
   firmware are subject to AFMAN 91-119.
   2.13.4. Electronic Circuits Controlling Critical Signals or Performing Critical Functions.
   The integrity of critical functions implemented with electronic circuits must be protected
   IAW AFMAN 91-119.
   2.13.5. Programmable Logic Devices. Critical circuitry incorporating FPGA’s or other logic
   devices subject to a single event upset shall employ redundancy or other discipline to protect
   the integrity of the critical function for all credible environments. Reliability goals specified
   in AFI 91-107 are sufficient for systems incorporating programmable logic devices.

Section 2C—Electrical Subsystems and Hazards

2.14. General Design Criteria. A major part of a nuclear weapon system is composed of
electrical subsystems designed to monitor, target, prearm, arm, launch, release or authorize the
use of nuclear weapons. Design these subsystems to preclude accidental operation, single
component failure or electrical disturbance from performing or degrading critical functions.
   2.14.1. Electromagnetic Interference (EMI). Design all electronic and electrical subsystems
   or equipment within or associated with nuclear weapon systems to minimize undesired
   responses and emissions (refer to MIL-STD-461, Requirements for the Control of
   Electromagnetic Interference Characteristics of Subsystems and Equipment and MIL-STD-
   464, Requirements for Systems Electromagnetic Environmental Effects,). The design of
   wires, switches, cable connectors, junction points and other system elements shall minimize
   undesirable radiated and conducted interference or transients when such EMI could cause a
   nuclear hazard or ordnance ignition.
   2.14.2. Isolation. In general, electrically isolate any critical circuit, either power or control,
   from other critical and noncritical circuits (consider signals transmitted on either time- or
   frequency- domain multiplexed transmission lines to be electrically isolated). The purpose of
   this requirement is to prevent faults or common mode malfunctions from operating critical
   circuits or explosive components in all environments. These requirements apply to all nuclear
   weapon systems:
       2.14.2.1. Do not use wire or cable shields as current-carrying conductors and cover
       shields with an insulation layer.
       2.14.2.2. Ensure electro-explosive circuitry, which affects or is affected by critical
       functions, conforms to MIL-HDBK-1512.
AFMAN91-118 4 AUGUST 2010                                                                           15


       2.14.2.3. Within the weapon interface control units, use crush-resistant shielded
       compartments and separate wiring bundles to isolate critical function circuits from power,
       noncritical circuits and other critical circuits.
       2.14.2.4. For hardwire systems, ensure electrical functions unique to the Aircraft
       Monitoring and Control (AMAC) and release systems do not share an electrical
       connector with nonnuclear functions.
       2.14.2.5. Isolate critical circuits from potential sources of unintended electrical power.
   2.14.3. Switching. Switch the supply side or power side of switchable circuits. For critical
   circuits, switch both the supply and return sides.
2.15. Wiring and Cabling.
   2.15.1. Routing and Installation. Install and secure electrical wiring to minimize vibration
   and chafing. Cable design and routing shall minimize electromagnetic coupling between
   circuits and the potential for damage during maintenance operations.
   2.15.2. Shields. Terminate cable shields at a connector backshell that provides for peripheral
   bonding of the shield. When shielded wires and cables contained within an overall cable
   shield terminate with pigtails, the cable shield pigtails shall not exceed 6 inches. Connector
   backshells shall have conductive finishes to minimize shield termination impedance.
   2.15.3. Grounds. Use a common ground reference connection for signal returns common to
   two or more circuits. Select ground wire or shield braid gauge that allows the largest current
   expected during system operation or credible failure. A credible failure must not offset the
   ground plane reference voltage; offsets it by an order of magnitude less than the level at
   which system operation or logic state could change; or cause the occurrence of ground-loop
   symptoms.
   2.15.4. Power Cable Terminations. Except for weapon and warhead interface connectors,
   electrical power wiring shall end in female connectors at the power source side.
   2.15.5. Mechanical Support. Provide critical circuit wiring with mechanical support that is
   an integral part of the connector at the entry point into the electrical connector. Mechanical
   support should provide strain relief during mating and demating of connectors.
2.16. Electrical Connectors. Ensure all hardwire electrical connectors associated with nuclear
weapon circuits conform to MIL-DTL-38999-XX series, General Specification for Connector,
Electrical, Circular, Miniature, High Density, Quick Disconnect (Bayonet, Threaded, and
Breech Coupling), Environment Resistant, Removable Crimp and Hermetic Solder Contacts.
This requirement does not apply to electrical connectors used within a line replaceable unit.
   2.16.1. Alignment and Mating. Design electrical connectors to prevent misalignment of
   connector components and bent pins during mating. Use diverse connector designs to ensure
   connectors are compatible with the intended connection only and incompatible with other
   connectors. Use only one wire for each pin and minimize the number of spare pins. Do not
   use these pins for mechanical support. Provide adequate access for connector mating and
   demating operations. If possible, make the mating and demating processes visible.
       2.16.1.1. Connector Pin Mapping. Connector pin mapping should minimize the
       likelihood of bent pins resulting in the inadvertent activation of a critical function.
 16                                                            AFMAN91-118 4 AUGUST 2010


   2.16.2. Sealing. Use environmentally sealed connectors. If used in electrical connectors,
   potting compounds shall positively preclude reversion.
   2.16.3. Mandated Use Isolation Exception. If possible, design the circuits within a single
   connector to meet the isolation requirements of paragraph 2.14.2. If all the requirements
   cannot be met due to the mandated use of nonconforming weapons or equipment, connector
   pin mapping shall ensure no single bent or misaligned pin can result in the application of
   sufficient power to cause critical function activation.
   2.16.4. Nonelectrical Connections. Ensure connectors do not contain both critical electrical
   circuits and lines carrying liquids such as coolant solutions, fuels and hydraulic fluids.
2.17. Electrical Current Considerations. Limit monitoring and testing current of ordnance
devices to a value at least an order of magnitude below the maximum no-fire level of the most
sensitive ordnance device or firing circuit component in a nuclear weapon system.
2.18. Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR). Provide for maximum practical protection against
the hazards of EMR, including electromagnetic pulse and EMR from lightning. Also, provide
protection from direct lightning strikes to the weapon system for all ordnance devices and firing
circuits. Ensure the design of nuclear weapon systems protects against the inherent EMR
susceptibility to electro-explosives, semiconductors and other devices.
   2.18.1. EMR Environment Levels. Although a complete survey of the EMR environment
   weapons shall encounter is not available, the ground-based and airborne radio transmitters
   and radar sets now in the Air Force inventory can generate peak power densities of about
   75dB milliwatt per square meter (mW/m2), equivalent to 3440 volts per meter, in the near
   vicinity of the antenna. These average and peak values or those specified in the weapon’s
   STS (whichever is greater) are the minimum levels considered in designs for EMR
   protection.
   2.18.2. Shielding Design. Ensure critical function components are protected against EMR
   induced component damage or functional upset. If feasible, use an integral shielded volume
   design consisting of shielded enclosures and wire and cable shielding.
       2.18.2.1. Shielded Enclosures. Locate critical function components within shielded
       enclosures that provide sufficient attenuation of external electromagnetic fields and
       surface currents to preclude electronic component damage or functional upset. The
       shielded enclosure design shall provide radio frequency gasketing for enclosure doors;
       minimize gap, joint and aperture sizes; and provide transient suppression for unshielded
       line penetrations into the shielded enclosure. Where conductive aircraft or missile skin
       surfaces form part of the shielded enclosure, ensure skin joints have low-resistance
       contacts with fastener spacing designed to minimize gap sizes. Design monitor circuits so
       they do not conduct or couple EMR energy into the shielded volume.
       2.18.2.2. Cable Shielding. Refer to paragraph 2.15.2.
       2.18.2.3. Terminal Protection Devices (TPD). Use TPDs such as filters and surge
       suppressors to provide additional circuit protection where shielding alone does not
       provide sufficient attenuation. Also, use TPDs on unshielded line penetrations into the
       shielded volume.
AFMAN91-118 4 AUGUST 2010                                                                     17


       2.18.2.4. Electro-explosive Devices (EED). Shield all EED firing circuits using a
       twisted wire configuration with the case of the initiator electrically bonded to the
       structure. A single ground point shall be common to all firing circuits. When exposed to
       the EMR environments specified in the STS or 50dB (mW/m2) average (whichever is
       greater), the maximum root mean square current in its bridgewire shall be 20dB below
       the maximum no-fire current of the EED. EED male connectors that are in an open-
       circuited configuration must install shielding caps that have electrical continuity from
       shield to case with no gaps or discontinuities in the shielding configuration.

Section 2D—Arming and Fuzing (A&F) Systems

2.19. General Design Criteria. An A&F system is the sum of components, devices and design
features that cause weapon prearming, arming, fuzing and firing as well as those components and
features that protect against deliberate unauthorized or accidental prearming, arming, fuzing and
firing. Both DoD and DOE subsystems are normally a part of the total nuclear weapon system
A&F design. The DOE design satisfies many of the requirements in this section. An effective
design incorporates the components and design concepts described in the following criteria to
satisfy the criteria in paragraph 2.2.1.
2.20. System Devices.
   2.20.1. Prearm Device. Design the A&F system to provide a unique prearming signal for the
   strong link prearm device in the warhead or nuclear bomb. Derive this signal from some part
   of the weapon system under direct human control to provide an unambiguous indication of
   human intent to use the weapon. The function provided by human action shall be reversible
   up to the time of launch or release for aircraft systems or commitment to launch for ground-
   launched missiles.
   2.20.2. Environmental or Trajectory Sensing Device (E/TSD). Include an E/TSD in the A&F
   system design. This device (preferably a strong link located in the nuclear bomb or warhead)
   prevents arming until the proper environment is sensed and responds only to an environment
   unique to the flight of the weapon. Because this stimulus may occur as a result of the release
   of a nuclear bomb or the launch and programmed flight of an air-launched or ground-
   launched missile, prevention of premature release or launch of the weapon is essential.
   Operating the prearm function shall normally be a prerequisite to activating the E/TSD.
   2.20.3. Launch or Release Sensing Device. Include a device in the A&F system that prevents
   power from being applied to the A&F system or applicable components within the system
   until a weapon launch or release is detected. For aircraft systems, this device (such as a
   pullout switch or breakaway connector) shall sense launch or release of the weapon. For
   ground-launched missiles, this device (such as a lanyard or a pressure-actuated valve) shall
   sense the proper launch environment. The design of these devices shall protect against
   accidental or inadvertent operation.
2.21. System Design Features.
   2.21.1. Abnormal Environment Protection. Include protective features in the A&F system to
   prevent prearming and arming in all credible abnormal environments specified in the STS
   document and in the applicable weapon system specifications.
 18                                                           AFMAN91-118 4 AUGUST 2010


   2.21.2. Dual Signal Arming. Incorporate at least two separate and independently derived
   signals, which cannot be generated by a single signal at any point, to arm the weapon. These
   signals are interrupted by (one or more) strong link devices located within the nuclear bomb
   or warhead. Ensure at least one of the signals is continuous after application (required for
   multiple power sources).
   2.21.3. Energy Discharge. Design the A&F system to provide for automatic discharge of
   stored energy in the A&F energy storage devices such as capacitors and activated batteries, if
   arming power is interrupted.
   2.21.4. Lightning Protection. Incorporate lightning protection to protect critical A&F
   circuits.
   2.21.5. Nondestructive Testing Compatibility. Ensure exposure to standard Air Force
   nondestructive testing environments such as X-ray, ultrasonic, magnetic and similar tests
   specified for use in the weapon system does not degrade nuclear safety for the A&F system.
   2.21.6. Chemical Compatibility and Reversion. Ensure all material used in the design is
   chemically compatible in all STS environments. Do not use materials that could increase the
   high-explosive sensitivity, generate an explosive gas or electrically conductive gas, cause an
   electrical short or reversion or create similar results.
   2.21.7. Monitoring.
      2.21.7.1. Provide the capability (always placed on the A&F system) to monitor the
      weapon state status in all weapon system configurations.
      2.21.7.2. Ensure the monitoring function design prohibits the possibility of introducing
      energy from any source that might operate an A&F critical function or prevent the
      transition of a weapon from a prearm state to a safe state if a system fault or credible
      abnormal environment occurs (refer to paragraph 2.17). If feasible, consider non-
      electrical monitor systems.
   2.21.8. Input and Output Isolation. Isolate the electrical inputs to nuclear safety devices from
   the outputs and use other methods (such as incompatible signals) to minimize the possibility
   of bypassing the safety devices.

Section 2E—Ground-Launched Missile Systems

2.22. General Design Criteria. Apply the design criteria in this section to ground-launched
missile systems and apply the noncombat delivery vehicle criteria in Chapter 3 to ground
mobile combat delivery vehicles.
2.23. Launch Control System. This system consists of the hardware, firmware, software and
secure codes used to authorize a missile launch and to launch the missile.
   2.23.1. System Design. Apply these criteria:
      2.23.1.1. Missile launch shall occur only through intentional operation of the
      authorization and launch control devices. No other system or subsystem, in operational or
      failure mode, shall be able to authorize a missile launch, start a launch sequence, launch a
      missile or operate the propulsion system.
AFMAN91-118 4 AUGUST 2010                                                                        19


       2.23.1.2. Controlled launching requires both launch authorization and launch control
       functions. Design the weapon system to detect and resist tampering with the launch
       control system. Continuous visual and audible indications to all Launch Control Points
       (LCP) shall occur when an attempt is made to operate the launch control system and the
       indications shall remain until the system operators acknowledge and reset them.
       2.23.1.3. The launch control system shall remain in or return to a safe state when
       component failure or electrical power loss occurs.
       2.23.1.4. Arm (operate) and safe (off) critical command signal functions shall not be
       complementary functions; that is, the absence of "arm" shall not be construed as "safe" or
       vice versa.
   2.23.2. Propulsion System Ignition Protection. Protect the rocket propulsion system with an
   S&A or A/D device (or equivalent protection) that can be electrically armed by a directly
   applied unique signal (whose generator is not located in the missile) and can be electrically
   (refer to paragraph 2.8) and manually safed. Generation of the unique signal requires some
   physical or electrical action unlikely to occur in a credible abnormal environment.
   2.23.3. Multiplex Control Systems. Use multiplex control systems, if feasible, for critical
   signals within or between LCPs and Launch Points (LP); within the missile; and between the
   missile and reentry system or nuclear payload. These safeguards apply:
       2.23.3.1. A single component failure or system fault shall not cause inadvertent
       transmission of critical signals or inadvertent operation of critical functions.
       2.23.3.2. The system design shall stop a change of state or an output of a critical signal if
       data synchronization is lost.
       2.23.3.3. The multiplex system design shall be compatible with system hazard and fault
       analyses so that the polling time interval and automation logic shall not mask any critical
       function activation or fault between successive polls. If this requirement cannot be met
       for all credible environments, provide a means for dedicated reporting, automatic
       shutdown or priority interrupts.
2.24. Reentry System, Reentry Vehicle or Payload /D Device. For each ground-launched
missile, incorporate an A/D device in the reentry system, reentry vehicle or payload section to
interrupt all power (except monitor power) to any warhead interface (refer to paragraph 2.8) and
make it possible to safe this device for all weapon system configurations. The A/D device is not
needed if it can be shown that a single component failure shall not apply power to any warhead
interface; the device is not needed to meet the criterion of (AFI 91-107 Table 2 Rule 2) for
inadvertent application of power or signals to the nuclear bomb or warhead interface; and
provisions exist for removing power to the missile if a failure occurs that could contribute to
power being inadvertently applied to any warhead interface.
2.25. Monitor Systems.
   2.25.1. Monitor Requirements. Provide systems that allow the operator to continuously
   monitor the safe status of the missile propulsion system; warhead or warheads (refer to
   paragraph 2.21.7); reentry system, reentry vehicle or payload section A/D device; and launch
   control system. When the operator cannot continuously monitor these components, provide
   for on-demand monitoring of the safe status while ensuring the weapon control system
 20                                                          AFMAN91-118 4 AUGUST 2010


   continuously monitors each of these devices. Also, ensure the operator receives a positive
   and timely indication of any change in the safety status of these continuously monitored
   systems.
   2.25.2. Power Removal. Provide for automatic removal of electrical power that could cause
   accidental prearming or arming of the nuclear weapon or launching of the missile whenever
   an unsafe condition is indicated. Power can be restored when the unsafe condition is
   corrected.
   2.25.3. Monitor Electrical Current Limitations. Refer to paragraph 2.17.
2.26. Command and Control Communications.
   2.26.1. Launch Control Points.
      2.26.1.1. The launch crew shall not have the secure code necessary to authorize the
      launch of or to launch a missile until launch authority is granted. This withheld code may
      be used to satisfy the unique signal input requirement for all ignition protection devices.
      A code that authorizes the use of a warhead shall be different from the code used to
      authorize the launch of a missile.
      2.26.1.2. For systems with a selective launch capability, the launch control system shall
      be secured to allow launch of one or more missiles without revealing or compromising
      any of the codes for the other missiles or military forces.
      2.26.1.3. Policies and procedures that govern the authentication and safeguarding of
      nuclear control orders are in DoDD (S) 5210.81, United States Nuclear Weapons
      Command and Control, Safety, and Security and AFI 11-299, Nuclear Airlift Operations
      (for airlift operations).
   2.26.2. Launch Control Points to Launch Points Communications and Code Devices.
      2.26.2.1. Ensure nuclear command and control communications meet the numerical
      standards that specify the minimum degree of protection required against the threat or
      commission of unauthorized launch actions by cognizant agents or third parties. For any
      device operated by the withheld secure code discussed in paragraph 2.26.1.1, allow only
      a limited number of attempts at operation using incorrect codes or include some other
      anti-tamper feature. Also, include a device or system to detect tampering.
      2.26.2.2. Secure critical command and status message transmissions against tampering,
      monitoring and substituting. If LCP and LP locations make physical security measures
      impractical, encrypt the messages and authenticate the status by cryptographic means.
      The communications system shall alarm the LCPs if tampering with the system occurs.
      2.26.2.3. An LP may respond to launch commands from a single LCP. Ensure the critical
      LP status is monitored at the primary LCP and at least one other location. Each location
      shall be able to take compensatory action if an unauthorized critical command message or
      status is detected.
      2.26.2.4. The LCP shall ensure that even after all secure codes are available; at least two
      people shall actively cooperate to command authorization and launch.
      2.26.2.5. Design the LCP and LP secure code storage devices to resist bypass or code
      readout and ensure access to the storage device memory is controlled to prevent
AFMAN91-118 4 AUGUST 2010                                                                       21


       unauthorized code changes. Prohibit the use of maintenance tools or other devices that
       can change the memory to a standard unclassified code, except when the tool or device
       shall stop use of the code storage device for its intended purpose, which must cause an
       alarm and positive indications to be received at the LCP.
       2.26.2.6. Make the signal commands for controlling the critical functions of prearming
       and launching unique, and do not store them in the weapon control system in a directly
       usable form. Also, prevent inadvertent and deliberate unauthorized access and use of the
       unique signals by such means as deriving unique signals from secure code commands,
       storing the signals in permuted form and storing parts of the signals in separate locations.
2.27. Mobile Launch Points and Mobile Launch Control Points. For movement of a fully
assembled missile and reentry system or nuclear payload, add safety devices to maintain the safe
state of missile propulsion and A&F systems in normal and credible abnormal environments.

Section 2F—Aircraft and Air-Launched Missiles

2.28. Criteria Applicability. Apply the design criteria in this section to aircraft delivery,
launch, suspension, release, and weapon monitor and control systems. The safety devices these
criteria require may also be used for nonnuclear stores, except where their use is specifically
restricted.
2.29. General Design Criteria. Design the aircraft nuclear weapon system to meet these
criteria:
   2.29.1. Aircraft Monitor and Control (AMAC) and Release System Electrical Power.
       2.29.1.1. Ensure critical functions shall not occur by opening a circuit breaker or other
       circuit protective device. Also, do not connect operating power or control functions to a
       device (such as a semiconductor) whose major failure mode could cause activation of a
       critical function. Aircraft electrical power failure shall not jeopardize the safe condition
       of a weapon.
       2.29.1.2. Power the monitor and control functions, unlocking devices, S&A and A/D
       devices from an electrical bus that can be automatically powered from a secondary or
       backup power source if the primary power source is lost.
   2.29.2. Prearmed Nuclear Bomb Release. For a prearmed nuclear bomb release (not
   jettison), apply electrical power on one or more designated pins identified in the AMAC
   specifications of the weapon interface connector before and during electrical separation of
   the weapon from the aircraft.
   2.29.3. Inadvertent Power at Weapon Interface. Ensure malfunction or accidental operation
   of a single component does not result in application of unintended power to the nuclear bomb
   or missile interface.
   2.29.4. Cable and Connector Design. Make connector pin assignments to protect against
   inadvertent application of prearm and arming power to the nuclear bomb or warhead as the
   result of damaged cables and/or connectors. The design shall guard against cable or
   connector selection and cable routing susceptible to damage during assembly, maintenance
   and test operations.
 22                                                            AFMAN91-118 4 AUGUST 2010


2.30. Nuclear Weapon Suspension and Release Systems. Design the suspension and release
system to prevent weapon separation, release, ejection, launch or jettison by any means other
than proper operation of control devices. Protect all mechanical cables in the system from
accidental operation and withhold electrical power to suspension and release components until
release preparation begins.
   2.30.1. Suspension Lock Monitor. Ensure the latched and locked condition of
   suspensiondevices is observable while the aircraft is on the ground. Also, ensure the locked
   condition can be determined electrically while the aircraft is on the ground or in the air.
   2.30.2. In-Flight Reversible Lock. Provide an in-flight reversible lock that, when locked,
   prevents weapon release, even if the releasing force is generated and transmitted to the
   release system. Make the lock and its control independent of the nuclear weapon release
   system and the electrical connections between the aircraft and the weapon. The in-flight
   reversible lock system shall:
       2.30.2.1. Mechanically restrain the releasing device.
       2.30.2.2. Stop release or launch if maximum available release force is accidentally
       applied in the release mechanism.
       2.30.2.3. Fail safe in the event a failure occurs when the lock is locked.
       2.30.2.4. Disable all means of release when in the locked position.
       2.30.2.5. Permit ground personnel to visually check the locked state. For direct visual
       inspection, the locking device itself shall present an unmistakable indication of the locked
       state.
       2.30.2.6. Be protected from accidental operation.
       2.30.2.7. Provide a method in the crew compartment to show tampering with the
       aircrew's controls of the in-flight reversible lock.
       2.30.2.8. Provide the aircrew with a remote indication of the fully locked or unlocked (or
       both) positions of the in-flight lock. If using a single indication for the locked state,
       reflect only the fully locked position of the in-flight reversible lock. If using a single
       indication for the unlocked state, reflect every state other than a fully locked state. The
       remote indication system shall not allow an apparent indication to the aircrew of a locked
       state if an unlocked state exists.
       2.30.2.9. Ensure the safety lock mechanically restrains the suspension and release
       linkage if hooks are used in the suspension and release linkage. The safety lock shall
       mechanically restrain each hook that can be individually latched or unlatched.
       2.30.2.10. Relock if unlock power is removed (accidentally or intentionally) while the
       lock is unlocked.
   2.30.3. Pylon Jettison. Ensure pylons carrying nuclear weapons are either not jettisonable or
   the pylon jettison system includes a lock that meets the criteria for the nuclear weapons lock,
   as stated in paragraph 2.30.2 If feasible, use a single lock for both the weapon and the pylon.
   2.30.4. Unlock and Release Signal Isolation. Physically and electrically isolate the discrete
   energy control signals for unlocking the in-flight lock and releasing the weapon to the
AFMAN91-118 4 AUGUST 2010                                                                       23


   greatest extent possible. A release system fault shall not be able to operate the in-flight
   reversible lock and an in-flight reversible lock fault shall not be able to cause a release.
2.31. Nuclear System Controls and Displays.
   2.31.1. Prearm and Safe Controls. Ensure application of a prearm or safing command to a
   weapon requires a control or control setting unique to the selected nuclear weapon. The
   control or control setting shall require a separate and deliberate act by the weapon system
   operator.
      2.31.1.1. Prearm Command. Design the prearm control as a unique signal generator
      (USG) command signal according to the proper specification for the aircraft-to-weapon
      interface. Do not have the information that defines the unique signal pattern within the
      stores management system (SMS) software and make the information totally defined
      through aircrew member action. Use aircrew input for both the sequence of unique signal
      events and the definition of those events (such as data words). An insertable (by some
      physical action) read-only memory is the preferred method of unique signal data entry to
      the SMS. Initiation or application of the prearm command shall not occur in the event of
      an accident.
      2.31.1.2. Prearm Consent. The function of prearm consent is to inhibit prearming until
      direct aircrew action provides the required consent signal. Design the prearm consent
      control to reveal unauthorized operation or tampering.
          2.31.1.2.1. Electrical Interface Non-(MIL-STD-1760, Aircraft/Store Electrical
          Interconnection System). Make the prearm consent function a hardwired control that
          interrupts power to the prearm circuit controlling the intent strong link.
          2.31.1.2.2. Digital AMAC Electrical Interface (MIL-STD-1760). The design may
          implement prearm consent through software inhibits and controls. However, the
          consent signal shall originate only through aircrew action. Removal of prearm
          consent shall result in terminating the prearm or release functions in process and shall
          inhibit prearm and release until consent is reestablished. Any change in consent status
          shall also be sent to the weapon, which shall then inhibit any critical function
          processing under missile system control.
   2.31.2. Release and Launch Controls.
      2.31.2.1. Release Consent. In the operating controls for the release system, include a
      nuclear consent function to inhibit unlocking the release system unless consent is given.
      Nuclear release consent shall be a hardwired function. Neither the application nor
      reapplication of nuclear release consent shall unlock or inhibit the locking of the in-flight
      reversible lock. Removal of nuclear release consent shall relock the in-flight reversible
      lock.
      2.31.2.2. In-flight Reversible Lock. Design the system controlling release or launch of a
      nuclear weapon with a unique hardware or software control or control setting for locking
      and unlocking the in-flight reversible lock. Make this control separate from the release
      and launch controls and the release consent.
      2.31.2.3. Release Control or Control Setting. In addition to the control for the in-flight
      reversible lock and the release consent, ensure release systems have at least one separate
 24                                                           AFMAN91-118 4 AUGUST 2010


       control (hardware or software) or control setting unique to the release or launch of
       nuclear weapons. This control or setting shall not be used to release or launch nonnuclear
       weapons.
       2.31.2.4. Aircrew Member Release Input. For aircraft designed to release multiple
       nuclear stores, implement an aircrew member input to the release system controls before
       each release of a nuclear weapon on a target or series of releases on a target complex. A
       one-time activation of nuclear release consent does not satisfy this requirement. The
       intent is to specifically preclude the automated delivery of numerous weapons without
       further aircrew member input once authorization, nuclear consent (prearm and release)
       and prearm are accomplished.
       2.31.2.5. Jettison and Emergency Release. Jettison is defined as the release of an
       unarmed weapon. If implemented, design the jettison function to only permit jettison of a
       nuclear weapon in a safe configuration. For emergency release where normal jettison
       procedures cannot be accomplished, at least one distinct human action shall be required
       to separate a prearmed weapon in as safe a state as possible to preclude weapon
       detonation. The intent of this distinct human action is to provide a signal to exercise
       available options for returning the weapon to a safe state.
2.32. Multi-crew Aircraft Consent Functions. Design multi-crew aircraft AMAC and release
systems with separate controls for both prearm and release consent. Each consent function shall
require the physically separate and independent actions of two aircrew members. The
functioning of these controls is called "nuclear consent." A multi-crew aircraft used in combat by
one person may have provisions for prearming and release by a single person if a bypass is done
before flight. Design this bypass so a person cannot do it in flight.
2.33. Aircrew Cautions. Ensure aircrews are aware of these events:
   2.33.1. Uncommanded Unlock. Unlocking of, or an unlock signal going to, the in-flight
   reversible lock when normal operation of controls has not commanded unlocking.
   2.33.2. Uncommanded Prearm. Prearming of a weapon occurs when normal operation of
   controls has not commanded prearming.
   2.33.3. Indeterminate Weapon State. Warning that occurs when the aircrew cannot positively
   determine the safe state of the weapon. A delay may be designed into this function so the
   aircrew shall not receive a caution during weapon change of state from safe to prearm or
   from prearm to safe.
   2.33.4. Uncommanded Release. Nuclear weapon release signals occurring when normal
   operation of controls has not commanded release.
2.34. Nuclear Weapon Status Monitoring. Explicitly indicate the safe or prearmed state of
each weapon through continuous or on-demand monitoring. Ensure continuous monitoring is
provided when a weapon is in a state other than "OFF." Periodic monitoring on a multiplex bus
communication system may satisfy this requirement.
   2.34.1. Monitor and Control Circuit Isolation. Ensure monitor circuits are electrically
   isolated from power and control circuits; and monitor functions are independent of weapon
   control functions.
AFMAN91-118 4 AUGUST 2010                                                                         25


   2.34.2. Weapon Monitor States. The weapon states are SAFE and PREARM, with a "not
   safe" condition while in transition. Define the corresponding monitor states as follows: SAFE
   - safe monitor true; ARM - arm monitor true; and ENABLE - PAL monitor true
2.35. Interface Unit and Weapon Power Control. Control of power to interface units and
weapon interfaces shall require these actions and controls:
   2.35.1. Positive action to supply power to the interface unit (logic and power switching
   assemblies).
   2.35.2. Separate control that removes power from the interface unit (logic and switching
   assemblies).
   2.35.3. Positive action to supply power at the weapon interface.
   2.35.4. Separate control that removes power from the weapon interface.
2.36. Multifunction Controls and Displays. In addition to the other control and display
criteria of this chapter, these criteria also apply to a display system driven by software:
   2.36.1. Legends and Controls. Screen legends next to control buttons shall only display if the
   control button is active (capable of initiating a function). Conversely, all active controls shall
   have legends to indicate the active control function. All AMAC and rack lock and unlock
   commands require separate controls; for example, MONITOR shall not become SAFE and
   LOCK shall not become UNLOCK by subsequent activation of the same button. For multi-
   crew aircraft that do not meet this requirement, only one aircrew member at a time shall have
   control over weapon system functions. Provide a capability to transfer this control function to
   another aircrew member (such as a "TAKE" command).
   2.36.2. Dedicated Display. When power is applied to a nuclear weapon, one aircrew member
   shall have control of nuclear weapon functions and at least one display shall be dedicated to
   monitoring weapon status. Generally, the monitoring station shall also be the control station.
   Implement scrolling where operational considerations make dedication impractical and
   design the scrolling implementations in conjunction with a thorough advisory system that
   shall alert the aircrew to anomalous nuclear weapon system conditions when the display is
   not present. If control is associated with the scrolled display, ensure return of control is clear
   and immediate. The software shall not permit inadvertent control of the nuclear weapon
   system while the display is scrolled away.
   2.36.3. Combined AMAC and Release Displays. AMAC and delivery functions may be
   combined on the same screen display; however screen formats shall clearly differentiate the
   functions. Software protocols (inhibits and critical function preconditions) shall minimize the
   possibility of executing an erroneously selected function.
   2.36.4. Allowable Command State Transitions. Except for the SAFE-OFF state transition,
   each nuclear weapon shall transition to a new command state from an adjacent command
   state (a command state is the last state the weapon was commanded to take). The adjacent
   states are defined according to this sequence: OFF-MONITOR-SAFE-ARM. The appropriate
   AMAC specification shall define these command states. Change of state shall occur only by
   an aircrew member’s explicit command and such transition commands shall be independent
   of the monitored state. The SMS design shall ensure these control rules are followed when
 26                                                           AFMAN91-118 4 AUGUST 2010


   weapons are selected for a state change. In the event of weapon system faults or failures, this
   requirement would not prevent removing all power from the weapon interface.
2.37. Multiplexed (MUX) Systems.
   2.37.1. Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM). Whenever possible, use TDM for
   standardization purposes (preferred method according to MIL-STD-1553, Digital Time-
   Division Command/Response Multiplex Data Bus).
   2.37.2. Discrete Signal Isolation. All hardwired discrete signals in the MUX AMAC system
   shall meet the requirements of a totally hardwired AMAC system.
   2.37.3. Data Communication and Transfer.
      2.37.3.1. Only the correct stations, as determined by the system programming or control
      source, shall transmit or receive data on the SMS MUX bus. Data transfer, change of
      state or control signals shall not occur until the correct stations are successfully
      connected.
      2.37.3.2. Unauthorized stations transmitting or receiving data shall not affect the nuclear
      weapon interface.
      2.37.3.3. The MUX system shall inhibit any change of state or output of a remote MUX
      unit if data communication has been lost.
   2.37.4. Power up and Shutdown. The MUX AMAC and logic power subsystems designs
   shall ensure that, after applying logic power to a MUX terminal unit, a startup routine shall
   verify correct operation before the station is capable of output to the weapon or release
   system. Each MUX station shall operate safely during any change, application or removal of
   power from any part of the MUX system.
   2.37.5. Abnormal Environment Protection.
      2.37.5.1. Internal MUX Unit Isolation. Physically separate opposing critical functions
      (such as safe and prearm) as far apart as possible within each MUX terminal unit. Within
      MUX units, provide break-before-make action between changes of state of all critical
      signals applied to the nuclear weapon interface.
      2.37.5.2. Logic Power Levels. Voltage and current levels required to operate MUX
      station logic shall be sufficiently below operating levels to minimize the probability of
      operating critical functions if these voltages and currents are inadvertently applied to the
      nuclear weapon interface.
      2.37.5.3. Non-volatile Memory. Non-volatile, nondestructive read-only memory units
      are required to store MUX AMAC operational programs, algorithms for MUX control,
      AMAC and release logic processing. Ensure a deliberate, manually controlled action is
      required to alter the contents of those memory units. If the MUX AMAC operational
      programs and logic processing routines are stored in a common memory unit shared with
      other functions, take special precautions to protect the AMAC and release portion.
   2.37.6. Built-in Test. Self-testing shall not interfere with normal MUX operation, cause the
   generation of any consent signal or critical signal at the nuclear weapon interface. Also,
   ground testing shall not degrade nuclear safety.
AFMAN91-118 4 AUGUST 2010                                                                        27


   2.37.7. Operator MUX Control.
       2.37.7.1. Only positive operator control over the MUX bus shall generate prearm and
       separation control signals to the nuclear weapon interface. Critical functions shall not
       occur as a result of either automatic action of one MUX station or the absence of data
       from the MUX bus.
       2.37.7.2. The aircrew shall always have control of the MUX AMAC system and be
       informed of failures or changes in MUX system capabilities.
2.38. Air-Launched Missiles. Until launched or released, an air-launched missile is an
extension of the aircraft. Therefore, apply the same criteria applicable to combat delivery aircraft
(such as connector design, electromagnetic radiation protection, electrical subsystems and A&F
systems) to the missile. These criteria also apply:
   2.38.1. A&F System. The A&F system shall contain:
       2.38.1.1. A unique signal S&A or A/D device for arming and safing the missile part of
       the A&F system. The warhead prearm switch shall not serve as the missile system
       arming and safing device.
       2.38.1.2. A launch or release sensing device to isolate the missile A&F system
       electrically and mechanically from any arming power source until a mechanical force is
       applied to the device during launch operation (such as a pull-out switch).
   2.38.2. S&A and A/D Devices (Propulsion or A&F Systems). These requirements apply:
       2.38.2.1. Ensure each S&A or A/D device requires a weapon system operator to apply
       safing power.
       2.38.2.2. Incorporate the capability to monitor the missile S&A or A/D devices for the
       safe condition, either continuously or on demand. Ground personnel shall be capable of
       visually monitoring the state of the devices.
       2.38.2.3. If used with the propulsion system S&A or A/D devices, locate manual positive
       locks where they can be removed at the last practical point in the missile loading
       sequence.

Section 2G—Test Equipment.

2.39. General Design Criteria. Apply the design criteria in this section to test equipment used
to verify the proper operation, safe state and control of critical nuclear functions.
   2.39.1. Fail-Safe Requirements. The test equipment design shall prevent these conditions:
       2.39.1.1. Faults in the test equipment or test circuits that could operate critical functions
       or apply unintended power to the weapon interface.
       2.39.1.2. Faults within a tester that could degrade the nuclear safety of the equipment to
       be tested.
       2.39.1.3. Introduction of signals, voltages or currents into the weapon system that could
       degrade nuclear safety.
28                                                         AFMAN91-118 4 AUGUST 2010


     2.39.1.4. Operation or firing of an item under test, except when specifically designed for
     that purpose.
  2.39.2. Safe State at End-of-Test. Test equipment shall ensure a weapon system component,
  which has been operated during testing, is in the safe or inactivated position when the test
  ends. A positive indication verifies the safe position of such components. Test equipment
  failures or shutdowns should leave the components under test in a safe condition.
  2.39.3. Built-In Test Equipment (BITE). Subsystems or system features that require frequent
  periodic testing shall have built-in test modes or equipment, where possible. BITE for
  nuclear weapon systems shall comply with all design and safety requirements that apply to
  nuclear weapon systems. With nuclear weapons attached, BITE shall not operate any nuclear
  critical function nor energize any critical circuits.
  2.39.4. Test Procedures. The following criteria apply to equipment used to test the control,
  launch or release systems:
     2.39.4.1. Use test equipment only where necessary to set up and verify system operation,
     reliability and safety. Minimize the amount of testing done after mating the nuclear
     weapon to the combat delivery vehicle.
     2.39.4.2. Keep the interval between required tests on nuclear weapons or weapon
     systems to the maximum needed to maintain a high confidence level in the system
     operation and safety.
  2.39.5. Periodic Maintenance. The test equipment design agency shall provide periodic
  maintenance, inspection, test requirements and procedures for the test equipment so the
  equipment shall continue to meet the original specifications.
  2.39.6. Functionality and Safety Checks. The test equipment design shall include conducting
  a self-test before use. Based on weapon system requirements, design the test equipment to
  show system faults (such as improper wiring, line-to-line and line-to-ground shorts,
  unintended voltage and improper system operation) using the following tests:
     2.39.6.1. Preloading tests shall test the functionality, as defined by the AFNWC and
     AFSC/SEWN, of the entire DoD/DOE interface.
     2.39.6.2. Preflight, post-flight and periodic testing shall occur from any connector
     interfacing with the weapon to the furthest termination in the combat delivery vehicle
     (end-to-end check).
     2.39.6.3. When possible, isolation resistance tests of the combat delivery vehicle shall
     occur during the routine time-phase testing.
     2.39.6.4. Isolation resistance tests of all critical circuits external to the weapon shall
     occur periodically.
     2.39.6.5. Where redundant features are present in the weapon system, test provisions or
     BITE shall indicate the integrity of both the redundancy and the function.
  2.39.7. Component Failures. Electrical test equipment (including BITE) used with nuclear
  weapons shall not cause or allow one component failure to result in:
     2.39.7.1. Generating of release or launch signals.
AFMAN91-118 4 AUGUST 2010                                                                     29


       2.39.7.2. Initiating of a critical function.
       2.39.7.3. Negating of Two-Person Concept control.
       2.39.7.4. Unlocking the in-flight reversible lock.
       2.39.7.5. Operating an S&A or A/D device.
   2.39.8. Test Automata, Software, Firmware and Hardware Generated Using Software. All
   automata, software, firmware and integrated circuits used for testing or checkout shall meet
   the provisions in AFMAN 91-119. This criterion applies to software that receives, stores,
   processes, or transmits data to monitor, target, prearm, arm, launch, release or authorize the
   use of a nuclear weapon.
   2.39.9. Electromagnetic Effects. Control of interference and susceptibility within test
   equipment is needed to prevent undesired responses and emissions. The design of wires,
   switches, cable connectors, junction points and other electrical system elements (as
   appropriate) shall prevent undesired radiated and conducted interferences or transients.
   2.39.10. Test Equipment. Test equipment intended to test the AMAC functions at DoD/DOE
   interface shall incorporate parameter limits defined by the appropriate AMAC system
   specification and interface control documents.

Section 2H—Technical Order (TO) Procedures.

2.40. General Criteria. The criteria in this section apply to developing or modifying TO
procedures that pertain to system and equipment operational certification, training and cargo
aircraft loading. Any technical order change that may impact a Nuclear Certified design or
configuration should be reviewed by a Chief Engineer or designated representative IAW TO 00-
5-3, AF Technical Order Life Cycle Management and AFI 63-1201, Life Cycle Systems
Engineering.
2.41. Operational Certification Procedures. Before mechanically attaching and electrically
connecting a nuclear weapon with an aircraft or a warhead to a missile, operationally certify the
weapon system. These procedural requirements apply:
   2.41.1. Ensure procedures used to test the weapon system critical functions define a
   sufficient set of tests necessary to verify system operability and safety.
   2.41.2. Keep test requirements to a minimum after the nuclear weapon is mated to the
   combat delivery vehicle. The interval between required tests on nuclear weapons or weapon
   systems shall be the maximum needed to maintain a high confidence level in system
   functionality and safety.
   2.41.3. Ensure test equipment used to verify system and equipment functionality is within
   applicable calibration intervals and is in fully serviceable condition before being used with
   the weapon system. The design agency shall provide procedures for periodic maintenance,
   inspection and testing to ensure the test equipment shall continue to meet the original
   specifications.
2.42. Cargo Aircraft Loading and Restraint Procedures. Loading procedures for mixed
loads of nuclear and nonnuclear cargo shall minimize the movement of the nuclear cargo and
shall position the nonnuclear cargo where it shall not collide with nuclear cargo (refer to MIL-
 30                                                              AFMAN91-118 4 AUGUST 2010


DTL-25959, Aircraft Cargo Tie Down, Tensioners, MIL-DTL-6458, Aircraft Cargo Single Leg
Tie Down Chain Assemblies and SAE-AS8905, Aircraft Floor Fittings and Tie Down Cargo
Rings,). Tiedown patterns and configurations require review by AFNWC engineering.

Section 2I—Nuclear Weapons Maintenance, Handling and Storage Facilities.

2.43. Criteria Applicability. Apply the applicable Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) design
criteria and the criteria in this section to new and existing facilities that are capable of supporting
nuclear weapon maintenance, handling and storage operations. These criteria shall apply to US
owned facilities.
   2.43.1. Existing Facilities. Existing facilities and facility systems are not required to be
   modified solely to meet the requirements of this chapter.
   2.43.2. New Facilities and Facility Modifications. Any new facility, as well as, any
   proposed, planned, required modification or upgrade to existing facilities or essential facility
   systems shall require nuclear design safety certification action in accordance with AFI 91-
   103, Air Force Nuclear Safety Design Certification Program.
2.44. General Design Criteria. Facilities (as part of the nuclear weapon system) shall be
certified before conducting operations with nuclear weapons IAW AFI 91-103 Air Force
Nuclear Safety Design Certification Program, AFPD 91-1 Nuclear Weapons and Systems Surety,
AFI 91-101 Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety Program and DoDD 3150.2, DoD Nuclear
Weapon System Safety Program. 2I and 4H of this manual establish the Air Force design and
evaluation criteria, respectively, for facility subsystems that can directly support maintenance,
handling and storage operations for nuclear weapons. A systems engineering approach is
essential for nuclear certification of facilities. Facilities and the essential facility systems (EFS),
listed below in paragraph 2.45, shall be designed and built to preclude potential electrical,
mechanical, thermal, electromagnetic radiation and chemical insult to nuclear weapon systems,
assuming the occurrence of severe natural phenomena (e.g., lighting, tornadoes, earthquake), an
explosive detonation or other abnormal event (e.g., facility power surge, electromagnetic
radiation, fire, blast, dropping, striking, etc). These EFSs and any subsequent modifications or
upgrades to these EFSs shall comply with the criteria below. In addition, all interface or
connectivity between essential facility subsystems shall be designed to ensure that the nuclear
surety environment has not been degraded or eliminated (e.g. the interface between fire alarm
and the Blast Containment Management System (BCMS) software at Kirtland Underground
Munitions Maintenance Storage Center). These criteria apply to all US owned facilities that
maintain a capability to support nuclear weapon storage, maintenance and handling operations.
2.45. Design of Essential Facility Systems.
   2.45.1. Lightning Protection System (LPS). Facilities shall be provided with a LPS in
   accordance with NFPA 780, Standard for the Installation of Lightning Protection Systems,
   AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards AFI 32-1065, Grounding Systems and UFC 3-
   520-01, Interior Electrical Systems. Underground facilities (excludes Earth Covered
   Magazines [Igloos]) do not require conventional air terminal or down conductor LPSs, but
   shall have a counterpoise grounding system that meets the requirements of NFPA 70,
   National Electrical Code, AFMAN 91-201, AFI 32-1065 and UFC 3-520-01.
   2.45.2. Nuclear Weapons Side Flash Protection Requirements.
AFMAN91-118 4 AUGUST 2010                                                                       31


     2.45.2.1. Default Safe Separation Distance (SSD). Nuclear weapons, during intrusive
     maintenance operations, shall be protected from lightning side flash by maintaining a
     minimum 7-foot separation distance between a weapon and the walls, ceiling, hoists,
     structural supports and metallic conductors of the facility in accordance with AFMAN
     91-201. This is commonly referred to as the ―7-foot rule‖. If the facility (either above
     ground or underground) is capable of supporting intrusive maintenance operations,
     implementation plans and procedures for ensuring compliance with the 7-foot rule shall
     be documented. Also, a physical demarcation (i.e., paint or tape) shall be readily visible
     and clearly indicate the area in which intrusive maintenance operations can be
     accomplished. When not in use, overhead hoists will have designated parking outside the
     7-foot stand-off area, away from where maintenance operations are conducted.
     2.45.2.2. Alternative to 7-Foot Standoff. The required separation distance of the 7-foot
     rule can be significantly reduced by implementing the design feature known as a
     ―Faraday Shield‖ (referred to as a ―metallic cage‖ by NFPA 780) including electrically
     bonding penetrations to the Faraday Shield and installing proper surge suppression. In
     this approach, the facility shall be tested and analyzed to determine the effectiveness of
     the facility Faraday-like Shield characteristics. Based on the specific test results, the side
     flash and associated SSD within the facility may be reduced. This process is referred to as
     facility characterization.
        2.45.2.2.1. Facility Characterization Design Criteria. To accomplish a facility
        characterization, the following measures, in order, are required in addition to the
        customary standards for LPS (refer to paragraph 2.45.1):
            2.45.2.2.1.1. Define the Faraday-like Shield boundary of the facility based on
            facility construction.
            2.45.2.2.1.2. In addition to the bonding requirements in NFPA 780, AFMAN 91-
            201 and AFI 32-1065, provide upgraded or additional bonding of all metallic
            penetrations at the point of entry to the defined Faraday-like Shield using a
            methodology approved by the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) prior to
            implementation. Bond lengths shall be kept as short as practical, ideally less than
            4 inches and if possible/practical should go downward from the penetration to the
            Faraday-like Shield. Bonds exceeding 4 inches in length shall require additional
            calculations of impedance, voltage and side flash corresponding to the current of a

            2.45.2.2.1.3. Surge suppression shall be installed on all incoming service
            conductors and on low voltage systems. Surge protection shall have the
            capability to interrupt the energy levels of the established ―one percentile‖
            lightning strike. This is defined as the 99 percent severity level in the DOE
            baseline STS. When it is not practical to install suppression on communications
            and data circuits capable of interrupting the energy levels of the established one
            percentile lightning strike, alternatives approved by the AHJ shall be in place to
            mitigate the possibility of the lightning energy from entering the facility through
            these conductors.
            2.45.2.2.1.4. Perform the transfer impedance testing of the facility to determine
            the Faraday-like Shield characteristic (i.e., determine how closely the facility

             demonstrates Faraday-like Shield characteristics – electrical connectivity of
             reinforcing steel and facility structural members in the floor, walls and ceiling)
             and associated SSD.
  2.45.3. Facility Power Systems. Facility power systems shall incorporate an auxiliary power
  system to insure adequate power is maintained to subsystems that maintain safety or security
  of nuclear weapons at all times. Normal and auxiliary power systems for maintenance,
  handling and storage facilities shall be designed to meet the requirements of AFMAN 91-201
  Explosive Safety Standards. Emergency power systems shall meet the requirements of AFI
  32-1063, Electric Power Systems, chapter 5.
  2.45.4. Fire Protection Systems. Fire suppression and alarm systems shall be incorporated in
  the design of the facility. Automated fire suppression systems meeting the requirement of

  Hazards Analysis (FHA) clearly indicates that an appropriate alternative to a fire suppression
  system is justified.
  2.45.5. Hoist, Cranes and Similar Devices. Refer to the design criteria in Section 3C of this
  AFMAN.
  2.45.6. Security Systems. Security systems are designed and implemented IAW AFMAN
  31-108 The Air Force Nuclear Weapon Security Manual. Consider the safety risks from the
  possibility of exposing a nuclear weapon (either inadvertently or by deliberate unauthorized
  acts) to abnormal environments. Security systems that directly control access to nuclear
  weapons shall be designed to prevent unintended or deliberate unauthorized access. The
  possibility of unintended or deliberate unauthorized access shall be adequately mitigated
  through a combination of design and procedural means.

  features IAW AFMAN 91-201 Explosive Safety Standards and DoDD 6055.9E, Explosives
  Safety Management and the DoD Explosives Safety Board. A key element of the design is to
  mitigate contamination of facilities and weapons by limiting radiation transport mechanisms
  such as explosions/blast and fires. Blast isolation design of the facility shall incorporate blast
  zones/areas for the purpose of limiting the spread of contamination and consequential
  damage to the facility and stored critical assets. Design of blast containment/isolation
  systems shall consider such factors as siting requirements, blast zones, blast pressures,
  isolation requirements, drainage requirements and heating, ventilating, air-conditioning
  (HVAC). Compatibility between these factors, when incorporated, shall be assured. Ensure
  that the blast mitigation design prevents sympathetic detonation of nearby weapons by blast,
  fragment or thermal insult.
  2.45.9. Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) Environment. An EMR environment in a facility
  results from the combination of installed and portable equipment that emits EMR. These
  EMR sources in facilities include unintentional emitters such as lighting, motors, monitors,
  communication equipment, etc., as well as intentional emitters such as radio transmitters. All
  equipment installed or used within the facility, individually and collectively, shall not result

   chapter 9).
   2.45.10. Radiation Monitoring. Design maintenance, handling and storage facilities with the
   ability to monitor for both plutonium and tritium. This design shall work in conjunction with
   other facility systems, especially the blast containment/isolation system, HVAC systems, and
   the fire alarm and suppression systems, to minimize collateral effects to both the rest of the
   facility and the local environment.

  DESIGN CRITERIA FOR NONCOMBAT DELIVERY VEHICLES AND SUPPORT
                           EQUIPMENT

Section 3A—General Design Criteria.

3.1. Design Philosophy. The design of noncombat delivery vehicles and equipment used to
transport, store, support, load and unload nuclear weapons shall incorporate positive safety
features. The vehicles and equipment shall meet appropriate structural, environmental, stability
and mobility requirements. The STS document defines modes of transportation. The safety
design factors shall allow for uncertainties in predicting operational conditions; uncertainties or
variations in material strength and manufacturing techniques; and uncertainties introduced by
simplified design and test procedures. Good industrial design practices, standards and features
can be used to substantiate nuclear safety design certification of any commercially designed non-
specialized equipment as identified in AFI 91-103. At locations outside the United States and
territories, non-US design standards (i.e. European Specifications and Approvals) may be used in
lieu of the listed US standards.
3.2. Structural Load Definitions.
   3.2.1. Rated Load. Base the rated load on the combination of load forces the basic equipment
   must support or resist in a static state. This rated load consists of one or more weapons and
   the associated handling and restraint equipment and is the nuclear-certified load.
   3.2.2. Design Load. The loads used to initiate the design of equipment shall be based on the
   rated load multiplied by a factor of three (3), unless higher factors are required due to
   dynamic loading. Some examples of dynamic loading are accelerations encountered during
   air transport or towing operations.
   3.2.3. Stress Levels. The stress level, under the static rated load condition, at any point in
   the structure shall be limited to a level that provides a factor of safety of three (3) against
   permanent deformation. Where dynamic factors induce loads that exceed 1.5 times the rated
   load, as defined in paragraph 3.2.2, then the stress level at any point in the structure shall be
   limited to a level that provides a factor of safety of two (2) against permanent deformation.
3.3. Structural Design Criteria. In addition to meeting the design load requirements of
paragraph 3.2.2., ensure the design shall not be subject to a primary failure mode. A primary
failure mode is any material failure that degrades support or control of a nuclear weapon and
could result in weapon damage. The interfacing of loading between systems shall be considered.
These are typical failure mode classifications:
   3.3.1. Elastic Failure. Elastic failure is exhibited by excessive deflection.
   3.3.2. Plastic Failure. Plastic failure is exhibited by material yielding (yield is experienced
   when stress levels exceed the minimum yield strength of the material, as specified in
   applicable standards).
   3.3.3. Buckling Failure. Buckling failure is exhibited by excessive and quick deformations
   (collapse) with a loss of operational capability. Buckling load shall not exceed 1/2 yield
   strength of material.
AFMAN91-118 4 AUGUST 2010                                                                     35


   3.3.4. Fatigue Failure. Fatigue failure is exhibited by a fracture incurred by the cyclic
   application of loads.
   3.3.5. Composite Failure. Composite failure is exhibited by any composite material failure
   such as material delaminating under compressive load.
   3.3.6. Ultimate Failure. Ultimate failure is exhibited by material fracture.
3.4. Data Sources. In determining allowable stresses for equipment, select the material and
allowable stress specified in government publications and national standards (such as those
produced by the Society of Automotive Engineers or the American Society for Testing and
Materials). In cases where both an average and a minimum stress are specified, use the minimum
stress.

Section 3B—Ground Transportation Equipment.

3.5. Criteria Applicability. In addition to the general criteria of this section, apply the
following criteria to trailers and semitrailers, self-propelled ground vehicles, forklifts and
weapon loaders used to transport nuclear weapons on their basic structure.
3.6. General Criteria.
   3.6.1. Frame Load Support. Design equipment to support nuclear loads on the basic frame of
   the equipment rather than by lift arms, cables or hydraulic systems. This requirement does
   not apply to equipment used only to position or transfer nuclear weapons within a designated
   area (such as a weapons storage area). Hydraulic or pneumatic shock absorber systems
   between the basic frame and the nuclear weapon are acceptable.
   3.6.2. Static Grounding. Provide grounding provisions for equipment designed for specific
   nuclear weapon systems to prevent static electrical discharge through the weapon.
   3.6.3. Fire Propagation Potential. Design the equipment to minimize the potential for fire
   propagation.
   3.6.4. Shock Isolation. Design the equipment to minimize mechanical shock transmission to
   a nuclear weapon. This would include a Shock Response Spectra analysis for the system
   under load.
   3.6.5. Restraints. Ensure restraint provisions for ground transport of all nuclear weapons are
   capable of restraining the design load with accelerations from paragraph 3.19.
   3.6.6. Engine Start Switch. Ensure the engine start switch shall operate only when the clutch
   is disengaged or the automatic transmission is in the "neutral" or "park" position.
   3.6.7. Brakes. All equipment capable of freewheeling, except locomotives and railcars (refer
   to paragraph 3.10.1), shall have parking brakes designed to hold the maximum operational
   load on an 11.5-degree incline when headed both up and down, for a minimum of 15 minutes
   each.
   3.6.8. Stability. Ensure the equipment does not have an unsafe tendency to tip, tilt, yaw,
   sway, skid or jackknife while loaded in the maximum operational configuration and while
   undergoing maximum performance maneuvers such as emergency braking and obstacle
   avoidance.

3.6, include these design features in trailers and semitrailers: (does not apply to commercial
semi-trailers considered nuclear certified in accordance with AFI 91-103).
   3.7.1. Service Brakes. Ensure service brake systems meet the requirements derived from
   MIL-HDBK-1784.
   3.7.2. Emergency Brakes. Design trailers using tow bars with an emergency brake system
   that shall activate automatically and bring the trailer to a controlled stop in case of
   inadvertent tow bar disconnect.
   3.7.3. Mobility. Comply with the mobility requirements derived from MIL-HDBK-1784.
3.8. Tow Vehicles. In addition to the general criteria of Section 3A and paragraph 3.6, tow
vehicles (such as trucks, tugs and tractors) shall have these design features: (does not apply to
commercial semi-trailers considered nuclear certified in accordance with AFI 91-103).
   3.8.1. Brake System. The brake system shall be functionally compatible with the towed
   vehicle brake system. The towing vehicle shall not jackknife under maximum performance
   maneuvers. Brake performance shall comply with applicable industry standards and meet the
   failure criteria for towed vehicles in MIL-HDBK-1784.
   3.8.2. Parking Brakes. Ensure that the parking brakes, together with the towed vehicle
   parking brakes, can hold a maximum operational load and towed vehicle combination on an
   11.5-degree incline when headed both up and down for a minimum of 15 minutes each.
   3.8.3. Tow Vehicle to Trailer Interconnect Device. Make the vehicle connecting device
   compatible with the towed vehicle and ensure it meets the structural design criteria of
   Section 3A or commercial standards, whichever is more stringent.
   3.8.4. Fifth Wheel Safety Latch. Equip the fifth wheel with a safety latch designed to allow a
   visual check of the locked condition.
   3.8.5. Vehicle Structure. The tow vehicle structure should be designed to accept loads
   induced by including the item in tow, tow bar and not exceed the stress levels in paragraph
   3.2.3
AFMAN91-118 4 AUGUST 2010                                                                     37


3.9. Self-Propelled Vehicles. In addition to the general criteria of Section 3A and paragraph
3.6, ensure vehicles (such as trucks, vans and high lift trucks) comply with the brake
performance requirements in paragraph 3.8.1.
3.10. Rail-Based Vehicles. In addition to the general criteria of Section 3A and paragraph 3.6.,
apply these criteria to railroad locomotives, railcars and similar equipment:
   3.10.1. Parking Brakes. Ensure the locomotive parking brakes, with the railcar parking
   brakes, can hold a fully loaded railcar and locomotive combination on a 3-degree incline
   when headed both up and down for a minimum of 15 minutes each.

   Association of Railroads.
   3.10.3. Rail Bed Requirements. Use only classes 3 through 6 on rail-based vehicles carrying
   nuclear weapons.
3.11. Forklifts and Weapon Loaders. In addition to the general criteria of Section 3A and
paragraph 3.6, include the following design features in equipment such as conventional forklifts,
bomb-lift and high-lift trucks, munitions handling trailers with lifting devices and 463L loading
and unloading trucks: (For European forklifts, see paragraph 3.11.5)
   3.11.1. Lift Systems. Design the lift system so it maintains safe control of the rated load if
   electrical, hydraulic or pneumatic system failure occurs. Include pressure relief valves or
   regulators in hydraulic and pneumatic systems to prevent overpressure. To prevent weapon
   damage, limit internal leakage in lift system hydraulic components so the maximum drift rate
   does not exceed 0.5 inch per hour.
   3.11.2. Tines and Adapters. Design tines and adapters for forklifts or bomb-lift trucks to
   safely meet all nuclear weapon operational requirements for the equipment. Ensure that the
   equipment center of gravity and the rated load center of gravity are compatible.
   3.11.3. Movement and Positioning Controls. Provide for positive control of the nuclear
   weapon at all times in the lifting and handling modes. Apply these criteria:
       3.11.3.1. Make all movement controls self-centering (except for such devices as the
       parking brake, steering control, transmission selectors, power takeoff and hydraulic
       pump).
       3.11.3.2. Add mechanical stops or electrical switches to prevent over travel in all
       directions of the lift control.
       3.11.3.3. Include in the weapon loader a capability for small increments of movement

       3.11.3.4. If more than one power-operating component in a mechanically parallel system
       is used to lift the weapon, the components may be individually controlled to provide
       weapon attitude adjustments. However, make the components capable of synchronization
       to provide a uniformly controlled lifting attitude.
   3.11.4. Parking Brakes. Ensure forklift parking brakes can hold a forklift with rated load on
   an 8.5-degree incline in both forward and reverse directions. Weapon loader service and
   parking brakes shall be able to independently hold a maximum operational load on an 11.5-
   degree incline with the weapon loader headed either up or down.
 38                                                                   AFMAN91-118 4 AUGUST 2010


   3.11.5. European Forklifts. European forklifts are considered nuclear certified provided the
   standards listed in the tables below have been met. Any updates to these standards will
   require review by the process owners to ensure there are no significant changes that would
   invalidate their nuclear certification.
The following European Union (EU) standards apply to the process of manufacturing nuclear

criteria of Section 3A, as a minimum design such equipment to have the features and controls in
paragraph 3.13.
3.13. Safety Features and Controls.
   3.13.1. Positive Control. System controls shall ensure the load is under positive operator
   control. The design shall have automatic stops in the absence of operator control or if the

AFMAN91-118 4 AUGUST 2010                                                                      39


Section 3D—Handling and Support Fixtures.

3.15. General Design Criteria. Design items such as load frames, hoist trolleys, test and
storage stands, and handling units to meet the structural design criteria in Section 3A. Design
weapon stands to remain stable when equivalent force equal to the weight of the stand and
supported load are applied laterally at the center of gravity of this configuration.
   3.15.1. Mobility. Ensure test and storage stands and handling units with casters meet the
   mobility requirements of applicable military standards and operational requirements.
   3.15.2. Stability. All handling and support structures shall show that they are stable (no
   excessive movement or tendency to tip or buckle) while laterally loaded to a minimum
   acceleration of 1/2 G. This can be shown by test or analysis or a combination of testing and
   analysis.
3.16. Weapon Containers. Use the design criteria in MIL-STD-209, Lifting and Tiedown
Provisions and MIL-STD-648, Design Criteria for Specialized Shipping Containers for
containers used for storing and transporting weapons.
3.17. Pallet Standards. Pallets used with nuclear weapons shall conform to MIL-STD-1366,
Transportability Criteria.

Section 3E—Air or Ground Transport Systems, General Use Tiedowns and Restraints.

3.18. General Air or Ground Transport Design Criteria. Design air transportable delivery
vehicles and support equipment to meet the general specifications of MIL-HDBK-1791,
Designing for Internal Aerial Delivery in Fixed Wing Aircraft.
   3.18.1. Pallet Lock Systems. Pallet lock systems on cargo shall fail-safe (i.e., a single point
   failure of an active component shall not result in an uncommanded release of the pallet).
3.19. Cargo Restraint Configuration Criteria for Air or Ground Transport. In addition to
the general criteria of paragraph 3.18, the nuclear cargo restraint configurations must comply
with these criteria:
   3.19.1. Minimum Tiedown Provision Condition. Industry working load of tiedown
   equipment should be used for determining the items working load rating.* Restraints must
   be loaded appropriately for comparison to be valid. As an example chains, wire rope and
   fabric straps cannot be loaded in compression, they only function in tension. Thus, a
   summation of force calculation must be performed on the tiedown device to determine the
   tiedown device load.
   3.19.2. Ground Transport Requirements. Ground transport envelopes are based on North
   American Cargo Securement Standard Ground transport directional accelerations (refer to
   Figure 3.1). Each directional load is evaluated without friction between the trailer decking
   and the cargo. Evaluate statically and independently using the restraining device rated
   working load. Furthermore, the restraint assembly must remain connected when not under
   tension.

Figure 3.1. Ground Transport Directional Accelerations.




Tiedown restraining devices consist of the following:

          Synthetic webbing        Chain                       Clamps and latches

          Webbing ratchet          Wire rope                   Grab hooks

          Shackles                 D-rings                     Binders

To identify a tiedown for a load in the forward direction, first determine the load on the restraint
device in the forward direction by using a summation of forces to determine tiedown device load.
Accelerating Mass x 0.8g = Forward load.
Repeat the calculation for the other directional accelerations. Use the forward load to choose a
tiedown device by finding a tiedown restraint with a manufacturer rated working load greater
than or equal to the calculated load. This criterion is derived from MIL-HDBK-1791 and MIL-
STD-209 and commercial ground transport standards.
   3.19.3. Air Transport Requirements. Air transport envelopes are based on directional
   accelerations (refer to Figure 3.1). Each directional load is evaluated to the material ultimate
   strength (breaking strength) statically and independently with a safety factor of 1.5 applied.
   Fiber straps are not permitted for air transport.

Aft                   1.5g
Lateral               1.5g
To identify a tiedown for a load in the forward direction, first determine the load on the restraint
device in the forward direction by using a summation of forces to determine tiedown device load.




Repeat the calculation for the other directional accelerations. Use the forward load to choose a
tiedown device by finding a tiedown restraint with an ultimate strength greater than or equal the
calculated load. This criterion is derived from MIL-HDBK-1791 and MIL-STD-209 and
commercial transport standards.
Notes for both load conditions.
*Any safety factors associated with industry such as is used by the National Association Chain
Manufacturers guidelines are based on the variance and manufacturing tolerances of the items to
guarantee the item can meet the working load. Secondary safety factors are not to be included
in the derivation of proper tiedown device sizing.


3.19.4. Ensure reaction forces on aircraft floor, pallet or trailer deck do not exceed the rated
capacity for those items. Ensure that all tiedown points (e.g., tiedown rings) do not exceed their
rated capacity.
   3.19.5. Cargo restraint configurations shall be compatible with weapon design to prevent
   inadvertent activation of environmental sensing devices.

   In addition to the evaluation criteria in this chapter, the responsible engineering office shall
   define supplemental criteria (based on system and subsystem specifications pertaining to
   nuclear safety design requirements) applicable to the unique design features of the system
   being developed or modified. This requirement also applies to Air Force organizations with
   responsibility for providing engineering and compatibility guidance for a system or
   subsystem developed by an allied country for use with US nuclear weapons. The
   organization with engineering responsibility and the appropriate nuclear safety evaluation
   agency shall determine the adequacy of proposed and completed designs, surveys, tests and
   analyses to meet nuclear safety requirements.
   4.1.2. Evaluation Source Data.
       4.1.2.1. The data from surveys, tests and analyses are essential in making nuclear safety
       evaluations. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses provide a basis for these
       evaluations. The analyses shall consider and be compatible with the concept used to
       design the system; that is, energy control and information control.
       4.1.2.2. When military specifications or standards exist that satisfy nuclear safety
       requirements, the responsible agency can meet the test and analysis requirements by
       showing that those specifications or standards have been met.
   4.1.3. Numerical Evaluations. Tests or analyses (or both) may be used to establish that
   numerical design criteria as defined in AFI 91-107 are met. However, demonstrating by test
   or analysis that a numerical criterion is satisfied is not sufficient in itself to establish the
   adequacy of the design. An assessment of the safety features of the weapon system, using the
   applicable qualitative design criteria that implement the positive measures required by the
   DoD Nuclear Weapon System Safety Standards, shall support the evaluation against the
   numerical criteria.
   4.1.4. System-Level Evaluations. The primary concerns of nuclear weapon system safety
   analyses are unauthorized or accidental nuclear detonation; accidental prearming of a nuclear
   weapon; accidental launch, release or jettison of a nuclear weapon; accidental power applied
   to the nuclear weapon interface; and circumvention of the Two-Person Concept (where
   applicable) for authorization, launch, prearm or unlock. For analysis purposes, express
   accident rates for both the warhead and delivery system in the same units. Use worst-case
   generic failure rate data for these required analyses:

     4.1.4.1. System and Subsystem Hazards Analysis. From the conceptual through post
     design phases, perform general analyses of each subsystem and major component; their
     relationship to each other and their interfaces; environments that could affect them; and
     hazards they could cause.
     4.1.4.2. Preliminary Hazard Analysis. Early in the design phase, conduct a complete,
     qualitative and nonmathematical assessment of the hardware safety features. This
     analysis can provide the basis for determining other required analyses.
     4.1.4.3. Fault Hazard Analysis. This analysis starts during the demonstration and
     validation phase. It provides component-level information on failure modes, effects,
     causes and common-cause susceptibilities within a given subsystem. The information is
     used in fault-tree and common-cause analyses.
     4.1.4.4. Operating and Support Hazard Analysis. This analysis starts during the
     demonstration and validation phase. It evaluates the hazard potential due to procedural
     flaws or personnel errors during each phase of the STS. Hazards that contribute to the
     primary concerns listed in paragraph 4.1.4 are the primary focus of the analysis. The
     information is used in fault-tree and common-cause analyses.
     4.1.4.5. Fault-Tree Analysis. This analysis starts during the full-scale engineering
     development phase. It provides qualitative and quantitative measures of nuclear safety
     relative to the primary concerns listed in paragraph 4.1.4.
     4.1.4.6. Common-Cause Analysis. This analysis starts during the full-scale engineering
     development phase after the fault-tree is constructed. It uses the fault-tree minimal cut
     sets (or prime implicants) to qualitatively assess system susceptibility to potential
     common-cause failure mechanisms.
     4.1.4.7. Circuit Logic Analysis. Conduct a circuit logic analysis during developmental
     and post design phases to determine the possibilities of accidental operation of critical
     circuits. Include studies of electrical and electronic systems to determine the effects of
     component failures on the circuit operation.
     4.1.4.8. Bent Pin Analysis. If not covered by any other analysis, perform a bent pin
     analysis to verify pin assignments and power sources designed according to paragraph
     2.16.1. This analysis shall evaluate the likelihood of critical functions occurring due to
     bent connector pins.
     4.1.4.9. Safety Testing. When required by the system, subsystem, equipment failure
     modes and effects analysis, perform the following safety validation tests and consider
     them an integral part of the development and acceptance tests or the demonstration tests:
        4.1.4.9.1. Laboratory tests, functional mockups, models or simulations to
        demonstrate partial verification of safety characteristics or procedures.
        4.1.4.9.2. Safety tests on devices and components associated with critical functions
        to determine the degree of hazard or margin of safety.
        4.1.4.9.3. Induced failure tests to demonstrate the failure mode(s) of components
        associated with critical functions.

           4.1.4.9.4. Evaluations of support equipment for nuclear logistics movement and
           ground mobile combat delivery vehicles according to Chapter 5.
   4.1.5. Design and Procedural Priorities. Comply with safety requirements in this order:
       4.1.5.1. Ensure safety through incorporation of proper design features.
       4.1.5.2. Use additional safety devices when safety requirements cannot be met by the
       basic design.
   4.1.6. Explosive Ordnance Disposal. Evaluate aircraft and missile systems to ensure
   adequate emergency access is permitted to those components and circuits as required to carry
   out render-safe procedures. Analyze the systems to ensure render-safe procedures meet the
   requirements of paragraph 2.5.
   4.1.7. Environmental Criteria. Derive the environmental requirements for each nuclear
   weapon system from the predicted normal and credible abnormal operational environments.
   Consider all possible environments with the goal of preventing an adverse response under all
   conditions.
       4.1.7.1. Nuclear Weapon Systems. Use the STS as the basic document to define
       operational environments, both normal and credible abnormal, for nuclear bombs and
       warheads. The DoD/DOE Environmental Data Bank is another source of data.
       4.1.7.2. Support Equipment. Generally derive the environmental testing requirements for
       support equipment from the STS and other military equipment standards. Use the more
       stringent of either the military standard requirements or the predicted environments for
       the environmental criteria.
   4.1.8. S&A and A/D Devices. Test and evaluate these devices according to MIL-HDBK-
   1512.
   4.1.9. Protection of Friendly Territory. Evaluate and test the weapon system design for its
   adequacy to prevent accidental or deliberate unauthorized changes in targeting. Also,
   evaluate the system to ensure adequate safety design features exist to prevent nuclear
   detonations, except within the boundaries of the designated target area.
   4.1.10. Human Engineering. Using accepted human engineering factors and methods,
   conduct error analyses and error-reduction studies to identify weapon system modes that may
   cause hazardous conditions.

study to achieve maximum nuclear safety consistent with operational requirements. In addition
to the general requirements of paragraph 4.1, conduct this analysis.
   4.5.1. Analysis of Susceptibility to Unauthorized Launch (UL). Perform an analysis of the
   nuclear weapon system’s UL susceptibility according to AFI 91-106, Unauthorized Launch
   and Launch Action Studies. The objectives are to identify possible ways to accomplish a UL
   by negating the nuclear safety design safeguards of a nuclear weapon system and to assess
   the means of detecting a UL attempt and what countermeasures to apply. The analysis may
   reveal design deficiencies in the system involving human actions or component failures.

     function software and assemblies, wires, connectors and other hardware that, when
     considered totally, define the AMAC and nuclear suspension and release systems. This
     evaluation defines the nuclear system configuration and the interfaces and functional
     interaction between the nuclear weapon system and other aircraft systems.
     4.6.2.2. Hazard Analysis. The integrated assessment shall also identify nonnuclear
     system operational or failure hazards that could degrade the safety and functionality of
     the nuclear system or a loaded nuclear store.
     4.6.2.3. Requirements Compliance Summary. The evaluation analysis shall summarize
     the applicable design requirements of Chapter 2 and show how these requirements were

     4.8.1.2. Default Safe Separation Distance (SSD). If the facility (either above ground or
     underground) is capable of supporting intrusive maintenance operations, implementation
     plans and procedures for ensuring compliance with the 7-foot rule shall be documented.
     Verify a default Safe Separation Distance of 7 feet is maintained between a weapon and
     the walls, ceiling, hoists, structural supports and metallic conductors of the facility in
     accordance with AFMAN 91-201. This is commonly referred to as the ―7-foot rule‖.
     Verify that a physical demarcation (e.g., paint or tape) is readily visible and clearly
     indicates the area in which intrusive maintenance operations can be accomplished.
     Verify overhead hoists have a designated parking area outside the 7-foot stand-off area,
     away from where maintenance operations are conducted when hoists are not in use.

         correctly installed at the point of entry to the defined Faraday-like Shield using a
         methodology approved by the AHJ prior to implementation. Verify bond lengths
         have been kept as short as practical, ideally less than 4 inches (if possible/practical)
         and goes downward from the penetration to the Faraday-like Shield. Where bond
         lengths exceed 4 inches in length, verify that additional calculations of impedance,
         voltage and side flash have been correctly applied to determine the final SSD.
         4.8.1.3.3. Verify appropriate high capacity surge suppression has been installed on
         all incoming electrical power conductors and on low voltage systems. When it has
         been determined it is not practical to install high capacity suppression on
         communications and data circuits, verify adequate alternatives and evaluations
         approved by the AHJ are in place to assure the possibility of the lightning energy
         entering the facility through these conductors has been mitigated.
         4.8.1.3.4. Verify transfer impedance testing of the facility has been accomplished and
         the Faraday-like Shield characteristic has been validated. Verify the appropriate SSD
         has been determined from the bond impedance calculations or the transfer impedance
         testing.
     4.8.1.4. Facility Power Systems. Verify facility power systems; including all auxiliary
     power systems have the capacity to supply adequate power to subsystems that maintain
     safety or security of nuclear weapons. Verify the auxiliary power system(s) are available
     in the event of a primary power system failure and have the capability to supply adequate
     power.
     4.8.1.5. Fire Protection Systems. Conduct a FHA to comprehensively and qualitatively
     assess compliance with NFPA 13. The FHA shall include an analysis for criticality

     Procedures). Conduct the FHA in sufficient detail to insure the safety of weapons and to
     provide baseline documentation to AFSC/SEWN and AFNWC. For existing facilities,
     completion of the FHA is required within three years of the implementation of this
     AFMAN.

     5C.
     4.8.1.7. Security Systems. Security system designs shall be evaluated from a systems
     engineering perspective to identify the potential impact to the safety of nuclear weapons
     and to ensure compatibility (to include EMR) with nuclear weapons. For security
     systems that control access to nuclear weapons, an unauthorized access analysis shall be
     conducted to ensure the possibility of unintended or deliberate unauthorized access is
     adequately mitigated through a combination of design and procedural means.
     4.8.1.8. Facility Security System Automata and Software. Evaluate software that is
     unique and developed specifically to control essential facility systems IAW AFMAN 91-
     119.
     4.8.1.9. Blast Containment/Isolation Features. Evaluate blast containment and isolation
     features to verify compliance with AFMAN 91-201 Explosive Safety Standards and
     DoDD 6055.9E. Additionally, verify the design mitigates contamination of facilities and
     weapons by limiting radiation transport mechanisms such as explosions, blasts and fires.
     Verify blast isolation of the facility incorporates blast zones/areas for the purpose of
     limiting the spread of contamination and consequential damage to the facility and stored
     critical assets. Evaluate the blast zones/areas to determine if they are separated from each
     other by barriers capable of withstanding explosions commensurate with the maximum
     credible event.
     4.8.1.10. Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) Environment. Verify the EMR survey is
     current and documents the levels of EMR within each facility. If EMR levels of
     intentional or unintentional emitters can exceed weapon STS levels, insure mitigation
     measures reduce the EMR levels to within STS requirements (IAW AFMAN 91-201,
     chapter 9). Conduct the EMR survey in sufficient detail to insure the safety of weapons
     and to provide baseline documentation to AFSC/SEWN and 498NSG. Changes to the
     baseline configuration shall be evaluated either through testing or analysis to determine
     the EMR impact on the weapon STS levels. Completion of the EMR survey is required
     within three years of the implementation of this AFMAN. The 85th Engineering
     Installation Squadron at Keesler AFB, MS is the AF Center of expertise with respect to
     EMR and EMR surveys.

      EVALUATION CRITERIA FOR NONCOMBAT DELIVERY VEHICLES AND
                         SUPPORT EQUIPMENT

Section 5A—General Philosophy and Criteria.

5.1. Criteria Applicability. This chapter defines the minimum evaluation criteria applicable to
noncombat delivery vehicles and handling equipment that support, lift or transport nuclear
weapons. Evaluation requirements for certification according to AFI 91-103 shall consist of
analysis, examination and testing (as appropriate) by the responsible Air Force agency. Good
industrial design practices, standards and features can be used to substantiate nuclear safety
design certification of any commercially designed non-specialized equipment as identified in
AFI 91-103. Equivalent non-US standards (i.e. European Specifications and Approvals) may be
used in lieu of the listed US standards.
5.2. First Article Verification. Use one or more of the following methods to prove the
adequacy of the prototype structural design (refer to paragraph 3.2).
   5.2.1. Analysis. Perform a detailed stress analysis and supplement it with selective structural
   tests. Correlate the test results to the stress analysis results.
   5.2.2. Nondestructive Tests. Perform an abbreviated stress analysis to determine all critical
   stress points and apply the test design load to the structure with suitable instrumentation at all
   critical stress points. This test should not result in a primary failure mode (refer to paragraph
   3.3):
       5.2.2.1. Use the verified rated load multiplied by a factor of 3 for the design load test.
       5.2.2.2. Apply the lateral and longitudinal test loads statically with the equipment loaded
       to its rated capacity and apply the vertical test load statically and independently.
       5.2.2.3. Correlate the test results to the abbreviated stress analysis results to determine if
       the structure meets design requirements.
   5.2.3. Destructive Tests. Apply test loads to the test article along the appropriate axis until
   the item exhibits a primary failure mode (refer to paragraph 3.3). The test loads at this point
   shall exceed the design load in each appropriate axis.

Section 5B—Ground Transportation Equipment.

5.3. Criteria Applicability. In addition to the criteria in paragraphs 5.1 and 5.2, include the
following tests and analyses in the design verification.
   5.3.1. Frame Load Support. Analyze the equipment to ensure the weapon is supported by the
   basic frame of the equipment during both air and ground transport, rather than by lift arms,
   cables or hydraulic systems. This requirement does not apply to equipment used solely to
   position or transfer weapons nor to hydraulic or pneumatic shock absorber systems.
   5.3.2. Performance Evaluations.
       5.3.2.1. Subject the equipment to maximum performance maneuvers to evaluate stability.

      requirements specified in the STS, CDD, CPD or weapon system specifications.
      5.3.2.3. Ensure mobility requirements of applicable military standards or requirements
      based on operational conditions are met. Accomplish mobility testing to verify structural
      integrity, stability and safety.
      5.3.2.4. Test brake systems while transporting or towing simulated loads that represent
      the maximum operational load expected in service, such as maximum weight and
      extreme center of gravity.
   5.3.3. Environmental and General Hazard Evaluations.
      5.3.3.1. Analyze the equipment to minimize the potential for fire propagation.
      5.3.3.2. Test or analyze the equipment to ensure mechanical shock transmission to the
      nuclear weapon is within weapon design tolerances.
      5.3.3.3. Test tiedown provisions for ground movement of nuclear weapons to verify the
      equipment's capability to restrain the design load.
      5.3.3.4. Conduct environmental tests, as required by the Air Force organization with
      engineering evaluation responsibility, to verify safe operation at extreme operating
      environments (such as temperature and EMI extremes) with the equipment loaded to its
      rated capacity.
      5.3.3.5. Perform tests or analyses to determine if the equipment has adequate provisions
      for static grounding.
      5.3.3.6. Inspect the equipment to ensure rated load and gross vehicle weight are clearly
      identified.

   verify trailer performance during accidental tow bar disengagement by full-scale testing or by
   limited testing and analysis. Conduct the full-scale testing while towing the maximum
   operational load over a straight, smoothly paved road at the maximum operating speed
   expected. Testing shall consist of disengaging the tow bar from the tow vehicle and
   observing the emergency braking action of the trailer. When testing the emergency brake
   system, consider these conditions:
      5.4.3.1. Distance from the point of tow bar disengagement to final stop.
      5.4.3.2. Lateral distance of travel from the point of tow bar disengagement to final stop.
      5.4.3.3. Attitude of the trailer at the time of stop.
      5.4.3.4. Damage incurred by the trailer or load as a result of disengagement.

       stops are made, in increments of 5 miles per hour, up to the maximum safe speed.
       Conduct the initial tests on a dry, brushed, level concrete surface. Stop the vehicle by
       operating the brake system to produce maximum braking force (panic stops). If deemed
       necessary, repeat the procedure on surfaces similar to the worst condition expected
       during the operational life of the vehicle. In each test, determine the maximum safe speed
       and record (as a minimum) these brake performance data: damage or excessive wear,
       stopping distances, speed range and contact of wheels with the ground.
   5.5.2. Parking Brakes. Conduct tests to verify the capability of the towing and towed vehicle
   combination parking brakes to hold on an 11.5-degree incline when headed both up and
   down, for a minimum of 15 minutes each.
