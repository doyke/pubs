PURPOSE: The Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-42 series of
publications is the primary reference for medical operations. This document, AFTTP 3-42.32,
provides tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) for home station medical commanders to plan,
prepare, and employ their assigned assets to respond to chemical, biological, radiological, and
nuclear (CBRN) incidents. In particular it addresses medical responses utilizing an all hazards
approach but is specific to those Medical Contingency Response Program (MCRP) teams that
are provided funded equipment sets for Home Station Medical Response. These incidents
include weapons of mass destruction (WMD) as well as incidents involving the accidental or
intentional spill or release of hazardous materials (HAZMAT) and toxic industrial materials
(TIMs). This AFTTP provides the individual concepts of operations (CONOPS) for the
following Medical Counter-CBRN (MC-CBRN) capabilities: Patient Decontamination Team,
Pharmacy Team, Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) Team, Laboratory Biological Detection
Team (LBDT), Field Response Team (FRT), Triage Team, Clinical Team, Nursing Services,
Manpower/Security Team, and Public Health (PH) Team. Note: The use of the name or mark
of any specific manufacturer, commercial product, commodity, or service in this publication
does not imply endorsement by the Air Force.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES: This document has been substantially revised and must be
completely reviewed. The TTP incorporates changes necessary to align with recent updates to
AFI 41-106 and AFI 10-2501. Removed information on roles and responsibilities above the level
MTF commander. It incorporates recent development of Public Health 886 Allowance Standard,
addresses emerging infectious disease (EID) and medical counter measures to CBRN threats.
Updated medical response information and guidance utilizing an all-hazard approach when
responding to CBRN incidents. Added and updated HAZMAT first receivers awareness and
operations level training requirements. Attachment 10 Added Sort- Assess- Lifesaving
Interventions- Triage/Treatment (SALT) Triage System as an additional systematic methods for

rapid assessment and categorization of casualties. Removed information that is referenced in
other Air Force or DOD guidance.


APPLICATION: This publication applies to all Air Force military and civilian personnel. Air
National Guard (ANG) units not collocated with active duty (AD) units will employ only the
Patient Decontamination (976A), BE (976H), Triage (976K), and PH (976P) allowance
standards. In accordance with (IAW) Air Force Instruction (AFI) 41-106, Medical Readiness
Program Management, ANG units are not required to publish a Medical Contingency Response
Plan (MCRP). All planning for the ANG MC-CBRN capabilities will be included in each wing’s
Installation Emergency Management Plan (IEMP). Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) BE
offices are part of base operations support (BOS) and not the medical unit. AFRC will execute
the requirements of this AFTTP related to BE and PH responsibilities and the 886H package
within the restraints of civilian personnel responsibilities. Some ANG and AFRC installations
may not possess the inherent capabilities to provide the response outlined in this publication.

SCOPE: This AFTTP provides essential guidance for Air Force Medical Service (AFMS)
personnel’s initial response utilizing an all-hazards approach to respond to an incident involving
the intentional or accidental release of CBRN. The ability to respond appropriately is critical to
mitigating the consequences of an event. Medical commanders must be aware of the necessary
steps to ensure maximum survivability and to safeguard mission capabilities. The doctrine in
this document is authoritative but not directive.

                                       INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose. Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) incidents can quickly
overwhelm medical units at Air Force medical treatment facilities (MTFs) and can pose
significant threats to all Air Force installations worldwide. This publication provides guidance
for medical units to plan, prepare, and employ assigned assets for the initial response to an
incident involving CBRN, utilizing an all–hazards approach at home stations (i.e., fixed-site
airbases). Additionally, it establishes a manning and equipment framework to guide resource
allocation. Initial response, as used in this AFTTP, is considered the initial phases after an event
has occurred or been detected. Initial response includes crisis and CBRN consequence
management designed to rescue and stabilize casualties, contain contamination, and preserve
evidence. Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) medical units are exempt from this AFTTP
with the exception of bioenvironmental engineering (BE) capabilities. See Chapter 17 for more
information on AFRC responsibilities.

1.2 Air Force Guidance. First response to a home-station CBRN event is governed by Air
Force Instruction (AFI) 10-245, Antiterrorism (AT); AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency
Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations; Air Force Manual 10-2503, Operations
in a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-yield Explosive (CBRNE)
Environment; AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Program Management; AFI 41-209, Medical
Logistics Support; and Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 10-26, Counter-Chemical, Biological,
Radiological, and Nuclear Operations.

   1.2.1. Emergency Management and Response Plans. Installation response to a local
   CBRN event is deliberately planned for in the Installation Emergency Management Plan
   (IEMP) 10-2. Each installation must identify its threats, vulnerabilities, and response
   capabilities and plan accordingly. This AFTTP provides the planning and organizing
   framework for addressing Medical Counter-CBRN (MC-CBRN) response in the MCRP and
   the installation’s IEMP 10-2.

   1.2.2. Guidance for Deployed Environments. Medical CBRN response in deployed
   environments, which is not covered by this AFTTP, is governed by FM 4-02.7/MCRP 4-
   11.1F/NTTP 4-02.7/AFTTP 3-42.3, Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for
   Health Service Support in a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Environment.

1.3. Planning Considerations. A large CBRN incident may rapidly overwhelm a medical
unit’s capabilities and capacities to respond effectively. The medical unit must still plan for
closed-base operations without assistance in the early phases of an incident when augmenting
capability may be unable to assist. This may be up to 96 hours without adequate augmentation,
though each medical unit must consider local threats, capabilities and conditions when planning
early phase duration. State and federal resources will normally be available 24 hours after a
request for assistance. In the event of a large-scale incident affecting the surrounding civilian
population, local resources may be delayed or unavailable. Local medical facilities may also be
overwhelmed. For locations outside the continental United States (OCONUS), U.S. government
10                                                           AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

resources may be delayed more than 24 hours. Host nation resources may be available to assist
OCONUS locations, depending on status of forces agreements (SOFAs). Access to host nation
resources requires coordination through the military chain of command and U.S. Department of
State officials, which may delay response. In planning for the medical response to a CBRN
event, the medical unit commander and staff must understand the assessed vulnerabilities and the
anticipated consequences associated with each of the threats discussed in this AFTTP. Medical
units shall prepare response capabilities based on the assumption that the medical unit may not
initially receive outside assistance and may have to sustain operations for up to 96 hours with
minimal assistance (e.g., no access to the Strategic National Stockpile [SNS]). This planning
will be addressed in unit-specific MCRPs in Annex P – Medical Continuity of Operations
(MCOOP).

1.4. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Threat. CBRN agents can be
used at any time, against any target, and by various delivery methods. CBRN delivery methods
include, but are not limited to: aircraft sprayers, missiles, trucks, artillery, smoke/mist grenades,
backpack sprayers, mail packages, hand-carried containers (such as briefcases), and vials that
might be used to contaminate food sources or other environmental surfaces. Air Force
installations may be similar to industrial complexes where the potential for an accidental or
incidental spill or release of a harmful chemical poses a risk to the health of the populace as well
as the environment. The release of CBRN agents, whether intentional or accidental can cause
catastrophic property damage, overwhelming numbers of injuries, and the loss of lives.
However, the mere threat of a CBRN event can cause anxiety and panic that may threaten
mission effectiveness. CBRN incidents may result in an inordinate number of people who seek
treatment believing they have a particular disease or exposure even though they are physically
well (also referred to as the worried well), as well as other psychiatric casualties. Historically,
CBRN incidents result in an approximately 7:1 ratio of psychiatric casualties to casualties
directly resulting from the incident. Medical personnel and planners should address these
psychological concerns along with medical issues for planning, prevention, and crisis
management.

     1.4.1. Chemical Warfare. Chemical warfare (CW) agents are grouped into four types:
     nerve, blood, blister, and choking agents. For homeland security purposes, planners should
     also consider all hazardous materials (HAZMAT) to include toxic industrial chemicals and
     materials (TIC/TIMs). Heavy industry located off the installation, hazardous cargo
     transported near the installation, and HAZMAT stored on the installation should all be
     considered as potential threats. The bioenvironmental engineer (BEE) should work with civil
     engineering (CE) emergency management planners to assess and analyze HAZMAT
     (TIC/TIM) vulnerabilities. They should also consider that terrorists might attack or use these
     areas to create a catastrophic event.

     1.4.2. Biological Warfare. Biological warfare (BW) agents include bacteria, viruses, and
     toxins. BW agents can be employed by a terrorist to produce mass casualties, disrupt air
     operations, or create fear and confusion. These actions have the potential to significantly
     burden or even overwhelm medical assets. Widespread and sporadic BW attacks would
     force a protective posture, thereby degrading operational effectiveness. For example, the
     limited anthrax attacks through the U.S. Postal Service in October and November 2001
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                   11

  caused widespread uncertainty and drained sampling, analysis, and identification resources.
  Consider food, water, and other means of agent delivery when making threat and
  vulnerability analyses. BW agents are highly versatile and adaptable. For example, spraying
  salmonella on a salad bar where Air Force personnel eat could render an entire organization
  incapable of performing its mission. Due to their vulnerability, intentional contamination of
  the installation’s food and water supply is one of the most likely methods for delivering a
  biological agent attack

      New technology and coordinated response plans deployed since the anthrax attacks of
      2001 have dramatically improved response time. In mid-March 2003, local authorities
      were notified by U.S. marshals of the imminent arrival of two suspicious envelopes
      addressed to a bomb wing commander. The envelopes arrived and one envelope contained
      a fine white powder. The disaster response force team of the bioenvironmental and fire
      department staff deployed to the local post office. The team followed plan guidelines to
      evacuate and barricade the area in the post office that contained the envelopes.

      In only one and a half hours, the response team was able to determine with 99 percent
      confidence that the white powdery substance was non-dairy creamer. The commanding
      officer then declared the scene safe. There was no impact on the intended target (the bomb
      wing) and minimal disruption of the local post office. The incident demonstrates the
      remarkable improvements that can be achieved with a planned response and the
      appropriate resources.

  .

  1.4.3. Radiological Threats. A radiological dispersion device (RDD) is any device that
  causes purposeful dissemination of radioactive material without a nuclear detonation. One
  method of dispersion might be a dirty bomb where radioactive material is attached to an
  explosive and detonated. The explosion produces radioactive and nonradioactive shrapnel
  and radioactive dust and can cause radiological contamination, radiation exposure (in certain
  circumstances), physical injuries, burns, panic, and fear. A radiological exposure device
  (RED) is one that uses a source placed or hidden in a strategic location to deliberately expose
  personnel and cause damage or disruption. Other dispersal methods might include passive or
  active dispersion of unsealed radioactive sources, such as deposition in soil or water or
  dispersion from an airborne device.

  1.4.4. Nuclear Threats. A nuclear weapon detonation, blast, or explosion involves fission
  or fusion of atoms. A nuclear blast releases massive amounts of energy (measured in
  kilotons), which are dissipated as a fireball, blast forces (waves), prompt radiation, light and
  heat (thermal) energy, and delayed ionizing radiation (fallout). A nuclear weapon explosion
  results in catastrophic loss of life, destruction of infrastructure, and contamination of a very
  large area. An improvised nuclear device (IND) produces the same physical and medical
  effects as a nuclear weapon explosion. Contact the installation radiation safety officer
  (IRSO) for more information about nuclear threats.

1.5. Medical Counter-CBRN (MC-CBRN) Response Capabilities. AFMS personnel must be
prepared for an incident involving CBRN on their home stations and be prepared to respond.
Medical units will maintain CBRN response capabilities organically within the medical
organization or through written agreements (e.g., mutual aid agreements [MAAs], memorandums
of agreement [MOAs] and memorandums of understanding [MOUs]) with other organizations in
the local area, or through a combination of these methods. The 886 allowance standards (AS)
provide the equipment and supplies needed for a CBRN response using an all hazards approach.
(See Chapters 7-15 for more information about each capability, Chapter 16 for ANG concept of
operations [CONOPs], and Chapter 17 for AFRC CONOPs.)

     886M       Manpower/Security
     886P       Public Health

     1.5.1. Allowance Standards. The 886 allowance standards provide medical equipment and
     supplies to manage up to 300 casualties (100 for ANG units); pharmaceuticals to treat up to
     300 CBRN casualties (not applicable to ANG units); equipment and supplies to
     decontaminate up to 100 CBRN contaminated casualties; personal protective equipment
     (PPE) and pharmaceutical countermeasures to protect 150 emergency responders and first
     receivers (not applicable ANG units); and detection and monitoring equipment to detect,
     sample, and identify CBRN agents. See Chapter 4 of this AFTTP for more information on
     medical logistics functions.

     1.5.2. ANG Units. ANG installations that are not co-located with an active-duty or AFRC
     unit with MC-CBRN capabilities will have only four response teams: 976A, 976H, 976K,
     and 976P. See Chapter 16 for more information.

     1.5.3. AFRC Units. AFRC has no capability to execute any MC-CBRN responsibilities
     related to the following allowance standards: 886A, 886E, 886I, 886J, 886K, 886L, and
     886M. They are exempt from all references to medical units executing any medical
     treatment, decontamination, laboratory, or pharmacy requirements. See Chapter 17 for more
     information.

1.6. Organizing and Equipping. Air Force medical units must develop, manage, and sustain
critical capabilities to provide MC-CBRN response. Although medical units vary in size and
available manning, all medical units must develop MC-CBRN response procedures and
processes and organize, equip, and train personnel to respond to CBRN incidents. These
processes and procedures must be detailed in the MCRP. Organizing and equipping personnel to
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                               13

respond to a CBRN event and manage patients at an installation medical unit requires a
combination of Line of the Air Force (LAF) and Defense Health Program (DHP) resourcing.
The LAF programs support the materiel required for CBRN response. The DHP provides
funding for CBRN materiel used to provide health care under normal operating conditions.
ANG resourcing depends on medical operations and maintenance (O&M) funding and normally
uses LAF or DHP funding.


   1.6.1. Medical Unit Responsibilities. All medical units are expected to support their
   installations’ response operations. Existing MCRP teams are responsible for implementing
   these capabilities. MCRP teams are expected to conduct medical surveillance, provide
   medical care and support, identify pathogens using the Laboratory Response Network
   (LRN), and support installation CBRN detection and hazard evaluation. MCRP teams should
   use this AFTTP to determine additional procedures and resources needed to provide a
   seamless response to a CBRN incident.

      1.6.1.1. BE is responsible for surveillance, CBRN identification and quantification,
      CBRN health risk assessment (HRA), and hazard communication. AFRC BE offices are
      part of base operating support (BOS), not the medical unit. AFRC BE will execute
      (within the constraints of civilian personnel responsibilities) the requirements of this
      AFTTP related to the 886H package and BE and public health (PH). See Chapter 9 for
      more information.

      1.6.1.2. All medical units must provide for pathogen identification using the testing
      resources of LBDTs (if available), LRNs, and the host nation, as appropriate. The testing
      capability at each medical unit will vary, depending on available equipment,
      microbiology expertise, and safety considerations (biosafety level [BSL]). Each medical
      unit should assess the in-house testing capability provided by LBDT and LRN resources
      and plan for supporting testing capability as needed through local, regional, state, and
      federal agencies. Overseas locations should use the referral networks pre-established by
      MAAs, MOAs, and MOUs, when possible. If regional or country laboratories are used,
      the sample should be split with one part sent to a U.S. laboratory. Suspect samples will
      be transported IAW International Air Transport Association (IATA) standards to
      continental United States (CONUS) LRNs or national laboratories.

      1.6.1.3. Medical units must maintain the capability to provide patient decontamination.
      See Chapter 7 for more information.

      1.6.1.4. Education, training, and exercises will be conducted as required by AFI 10-
      2501, AFI 41-106, AFI 90-201, major command (MAJCOM) policy, and local directives.

   1.6.2. Casualty Care Planning. Medical unit casualty treatment capabilities vary
   considerably and inherently depend on the business model of each medical unit. For
   instance, medical response (treatment) to CBRN scenarios may or may not include the
   availability of organic ambulance services, 24/7 emergency medicine, and surgical services
   because normal operating conditions dictate the level of care and service available at the
14                                                          AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

     medical units. Therefore, each medical unit’s MCRP should be tailored to the local
     capability to include any MAAs, MOAs, or MOUs, local jurisdiction, regional, state, and
     other military response capabilities (to include Joint-Base medical response conops where the
     AF is not lead for mission support), and contracts in place to support response operations in a
     CBRN event. The MCRP describes how the medical unit will provide casualty care after a
     CBRN event. See Chapter 3 for more information on casualty management.

     1.6.3. Antidote and Prophylaxis Assets. Each medical unit maintains limited quantities of
     BW/CW countermeasures or prophylaxis intended for first responders (and other workers
     who could be exposed during a response) and the initial treatment of casualties. Installations
     within the United States will coordinate with local public health agencies for plans and
     procedures to request and receive assets from the SNS in accordance with (IAW) the
     interagency agreement between the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and
     the Department of Defense (DOD). Overseas locations in foreign countries should plan
     based on combatant command requirements and host nation support.

1.7. Roles and Responsibilities. The following paragraphs describe the roles and
responsibilities for MC-CBRN response. See AFI 41-106 for more information on roles and
responsibilities for MR programs at the Air Force, MAJCOM, installation, and unit levels.

     1.7.1. Medical Unit Commander. The medical unit commander establishes MC-CBRN
     capabilities IAW AFI 41-106, this AFTTP, and local requirements. (Not applicable to
     aeromedical evacuation [AE] or AFRC medical units.)

        1.7.1.1. Ensures medical unit participation in the development of the IEMP 10-2.

        1.7.1.2. Maintains MC-CBRN capabilities organically within the medical unit or by

     Commissioned Officer (MRNCO), and Medical Readiness Manager (MRM). These
     individuals comprise the MR office. (This term will be used hereafter in this AFTTP unless
     a paragraph addresses one role specifically.) The MR office is responsible for the following:

        1.7.2.1. Provides oversight for the unit’s MC-CBRN response capabilities and assist
        team chiefs with the management, training and staffing of their teams at the installation
        level.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                  15

     1.7.2.2. Works collaboratively with MCRP team chiefs to ensure MC-CBRN procedures
     are integrated into the MCRP basic plan, MCRP annexes and team checklists, and the
     installation IEMP 10-2.

     entry control, and security for patient decontamination, quarantine, isolation, and
     pharmaceutical dispensing facilities.

     1.7.2.6. Participates in the local community’s medical response system (or other local,
     medical planning committees) planning and organization meetings.

     1.7.2.7. Ensure existing MAAs, MOAs, or MOUs with local hospitals, public health, and
     other emergency response agencies address CBRN initial and sustained responses.
     MAAs, MOAs, MOUs and the MCRP should address the following areas:

        1.7.2.7.1. Use of MC-CBRN medical response-related equipment and personnel to
        augment off-installation civilian response when requested.

        1.7.2.7.2. Use of medical unit resources to assist with quarantine, isolation, and

     1.7.3. MCRP Team Chiefs. Units are not expected to develop separate or unique teams for
     MC-CBRN operations. Unit MCRP teams must plan for all installation contingency
     response scenarios, including MC-CBRN operations. MCRP team chiefs, in conjunction
     with medical logistics and the MRO, are responsible for the following functions:

        1.7.3.1. Prepare MCRP checklists and procedures for responding to installation

        41-209.

        1.7.3.6. Conduct a formal inventory of equipment and supplies within 30 days of an
        exercise or real-world event in which 886 AS items are used and every 12 months, at a
        minimum, per AFI 41-209.

        1.7.3.7. Ensure personnel assigned to the 886 MCRP teams are proficient and qualified
        to use the equipment listed on their respective MC-CBRN allowance standards.

        1.7.3.8. Ensure personnel who are required to wear respiratory protection enroll in the
        installation’s RPP.

        1.7.3.9. Provide inputs for exercise development and lessons learned after exercises.

     1.7.4. Medical Control Center (MCC). The MCC exercises command and control (C2) of
     all medical assets except when those assets fall under the control of the incident commander
     (IC) at the incident site. The MCC activates the appropriate MCRP teams immediately upon
     notification of a suspected CBRN incident. The MCC keeps the team chiefs informed about
     the suspected contaminants, the number of patients being sent or transported to the medical
     unit from the incident site, patient decontamination status, and the like. Medical personnel
     who answer the crash phone shall include in their protocols (IEMP 10-2 and MCRP) the
     concurrent activation of the MCC and MCRP teams whenever a CBRN incident is suspected.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 17

  1.7.5. Fire Emergency Services (FES). The senior fire official on scene typically serves as
  the IC. The IC establishes the incident command system (ICS) appropriate for the size and
  scope of the incident. The fire department generally assumes responsibility for the following
  functions at the incident site:

     1.7.5.1. Establish contamination control zones and cordon area, entry control point
     (ECP), casualty collection point (CCP), incident command post (ICP), decontamination
     corridor, triage and treatment area, vehicle ingress, staging area, and egress as required
     by the situation.

     1.7.5.2. Extricate victims from the hot zone. With exception of the BEE team, medical
     personnel do not operate in the hot zone or warm zone at the incident site.

     1.7.5.3. At a minimum, provide gross decontamination of incident victims before turning
     them over to on-scene medical personnel in the cold zone.

     1.7.5.4. Conduct decontamination of all personnel and equipment before exiting the
     warm zone.

  1.7.6. Bioenvironmental Engineer. A BEE or senior BEE technician serves as the medical
  unit functional advisor for CBRN issues. The BEE provides subject-matter expertise to the
  IC and EOC on CBRN effects, health-based risk assessments, and operations in CBRN
  environments (in coordination with the PHEO). The BEE provides the EOC medical
  representative with incident information such as type of contaminant and expected
  population requiring decontamination. The EOC representative provides this information to
  the MCC. See AFI 41-106 for additional responsibilities.

  1.7.7. Public Health Officer. The PHO conducts disease surveillance and epidemiological
  response. This includes daily monitoring to provide early detection of unusual disease trends
  that may suggest a suspected or confirmed covert biological attack or disease outbreak. The
  PHO coordinates with the BEE to identify CBRN threats, identify limitations of protective
  measures, and assess local threats and current information on vaccines, antidotes, and
  possible disease surveillance trends against the installation.

  1.7.8. Public Health Emergency Officer. The PHEO is a senior officer appointed by the
  installation commander (ANG PHEO is a state appointee) to provide essential medical or
  public health emergency management. The PHEO works closely with other medical
  personnel and local/host nation public health authorities and corresponding agencies to
  identify, confirm, and provide guidance during a public health emergency. See AFI 10-2501
  and AFI 10-2603, Emergency Health Powers on Air Force Installations, for more
  information.

  1.7.9. Patient Decontamination Team. This team performs patient decontamination
  operations at the medical unit. All potentially contaminated patients who present to the
  medical unit will undergo initial triage, decontamination, and secondary triage before being
  permitted to enter the medical unit. The patient decontamination team chief ensures AS
18                                                         AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

     886A is operationally maintained and incorporates the associated MC-CBRN response
     capabilities into the MCRP. The team chief ensures all patient decontamination team
     members enroll in the installation’s RPP and have hazardous waste operations and
     emergency response (HAZWOPER) operations level training for first receivers. AS 886A is
     not equipped nor is the team trained to decontaminate contaminated human remains. (See
     Chapter 16 for ANG CONOPS.)

     1.7.10. Field Response Team. The FRT reports to the scene as emergency responders and
     is under the C2 of the IC. This team is normally comprised of personnel from flight
     medicine, the emergency department, and/or ambulance services. The FRT chief is
     responsible for ensuring AS 886J is operationally maintained and the FRT capabilities are
     incorporated into the MCRP. The FRT chief must also ensure procedures are coordinated
     with the pharmacy team chief to incorporate the AS 886E pharmaceuticals into the response
     as needed.

     1.7.11. Triage Team. The triage team chief ensures AS 886K is operationally maintained
     and incorporates the associated MC-CBRN response capabilities into the MCRP. The 886K
     team chief must also ensure procedures are coordinated with the pharmacy team chief to
     incorporate AS 886E pharmaceuticals with 886K response assets as needed. (See Chapter 16
     for ANG CONOPS.)

     1.7.12. Manpower/Security Team. AFI 41-106 combines the security and manpower
     teams into a single MCRP team. The manpower personnel are responsible for providing
     additional manpower support for tasks such as patient movement. The security personnel are
     responsible for providing security for the patient decontamination team and for ensuring that
     all entrances to the medical unit are locked to prevent contaminated patients from entering.
     The manpower/security team chief ensures AS 886M is operationally maintained and
     incorporates the associated MC-CBRN response capabilities into the MCRP. Note: The
     manpower/security team may include a decontamination support sub-team to support patient
     decontamination.

     1.7.13. Clinical Team. The mission of the clinical teams is to receive patients and provide
     medical treatment at the medical unit. The clinical team normally includes immediate,
     minimal, and delayed elements. The clinical team chief maintains an operational AS 886L
     and incorporates the associated MC-CBRN response capabilities into the MCRP. The 886L
     team chief must also ensure procedures are coordinated with the pharmacy team chief to
     incorporate AS 886E pharmaceuticals with 886L response assets as needed.

     1.7.14. Nursing Services Team. The nursing services team chief is responsible for
     maintenance and management of AS 886D. This AS augments AS 886L and provides
     equipment and supplies for medical units that have inpatient treatment capabilities. The
     nursing services team chief is responsible for coordinating CBRN response and treatment
     procedures with the clinical team chief.

     1.7.15. Pharmacy Team. The MCRP pharmacy team chief ensures AS 886E is
     operationally maintained and incorporates the associated MC-CBRN response capabilities
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                   19

  into the MCRP. The pharmacy team chief coordinates with the FRT, triage, and clinical
  team chiefs to integrate 886E pharmaceuticals into the grab and go bags.

  1.7.16. Bioenvironmental Engineering Team. The BEE team conducts HRAs IAW AFI
  48-145, Occupational and Environmental Health Program and makes recommendations to
  ensure adequate force health protection (FHP) measures are in place. This team also
  provides environmental sample collection and transport to and from the LBDT and makes
  recommendations to ensure adequate protection of personnel and facilities. (Note:
  Environmental samples being delivered to the LBDT should always be collected in a liquid
  buffer solution. Raw environmental samples should never be delivered to the LBDT). The
  BEE team chief ensures AS 886H is operationally maintained and incorporates the associated
  MC-CBRN response capabilities into the MCRP. (See Chapter 16 for ANG CONOPS and
  Chapter 17 for the AFRC CONOPS)

  1.7.17. Laboratory Biological Detection Team. The LBDT performs laboratory analysis
  of environmental and clinical samples to detect biological threat agents (BTAs) of medical
  and operational importance. The LBDT chief ensures AS 886I is operationally maintained
  and incorporates the associated MC-CBRN response capabilities into the MCRP. Note:
  LBDT will only run clinical sample on JBAIDS to support public health emergencies

  1.7.18. Patient Administration Team. The patient administration team initiates patient
  tracking and accountability for all patients processed through patient decontamination at the
  medical unit after the secondary triage process. Job duties typically require awareness-level
  first responder HAZMAT training for hospital-based first receivers. Medical units designate
  patient administration team members to respond to the incident site to track patients sent to
  community medical facilities. Team members who may have direct contact with potentially
  contaminated patients are required to receive the appropriate level of first responder training.

  1.7.19. Mental Health Team. The mental health team provides traumatic stress response
  for patients and FRT personnel.

  1.7.20. Public Health Team. The PHT provides the MTF with the capability to detect and
  respond to a biological event.

  1.7.21. Pilot Units. Pilot units provide technical operational testing and evaluation of
  equipment and supplies to the MRA. Medical unit personnel should provide the appropriate
  pilot unit with feedback and recommendations through MAJCOMs/SGX and MRA on
  allowance standard and CONOPS revisions.

1.8. Decontamination and Disposal Management. Cleanup after real-world operations
requires a coordinated effort between various installation and federal and state organizations
(e.g., Air Force Office of Special Investigations [AFOSI], Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI],
CES Environmental Branch), Environmental Protection Agency [EPA], local wastewater
treatment facilities). The medical logistics facility manager should coordinate with the BE and
Installation Management Flight to coordinate cleanup plans with all involved parties. The
medical logistics facility manager is responsible for maintaining appropriate documentation of
these agreements. Guidance for the proper treatment and disposal of decontamination
wastewater and other potentially contaminated materials must be included in the MCRP.

     1.8.1. Facilities and Equipment. Following decontamination operations, time and
     resources will not be spent cleaning the facility or equipment unless immediate reuse is
     anticipated. Depending on the nature of the incident, if federal and state agencies provide
     follow-on assistance, they will assume responsibility for these actions. However, team
     members must decontaminate themselves and process out of the patient decontamination
     area.

     1.8.2. LBDT Equipment (886I). The disposal of Joint Biological Agent Identification and
     Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) and M1M consumables and reagents (chemicals) is IAW the
     instructions on the safety data sheet (SDS). The consumables and reagents from the test runs
     must be disposed of as biohazard waste. They will be placed in red biohazard bags or
     biohazard sharps containers and disposed of by autoclave or incineration. Disposal services
     can be contracted or accomplished in-house via an autoclave. M1M waste (from the test run)
     must be neutralized with 10 percent bleach and can then be dumped down a drain. Expired
     consumables (probes and mini-tubes) shall be treated and disposed of as biohazard materials.

     1.8.3. Exposure History. Exposure records must be updated for first responders, medics,
     and other responders potentially exposed to CBRN agents, as well as BEE team members
     involved in field assessments or other activities that involve potential exposure. BEE and PH
     shall review personnel exposure assessments, AARs, and other incident response
     documentation.

1.9. Security Provisions. Physical security will be provided by the medical commander (posted
medical personnel) and the installation commander (security forces [SF]) as deemed appropriate.
Due to the sensitive nature of any type of positive finding for a CBRN agent, all aspects of
communications security (COMSEC) and operations security (OPSEC) must be fully
implemented and rigidly enforced. The LBDT and BE must have ready access to secured
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                     21

communications to include secure telephone equipment (STE) and secret internet protocol router
network (SIPRNET) capabilities.

   1.9.1. Test Samples. Information about testing, including the test samples and categories
   through which they pass (presumptive tests, shipment under chain of custody rules, and
   definitive identification tests) will be treated as sensitive material and protected based on the
   operational impact and standard Air Force release of information directives. Based on the
   threat, scenario, and the nature of the testing, for official use only (FOUO) or higher level
   classification applies.

   1.9.2. Supplies and Equipment. Although the likelihood of theft or vandalism to any AS is
   considered low, tight security should be maintained at all times. During routine operations,
   storage of supplies and equipment in controlled/no access locations with periodic inspections
   by designated medical unit personnel should be sufficient. During heightened force
   protection condition (FPCON) status or during actual response operations, equipment and
   supplies must be closely monitored at all times as outlined in the MCRP. For AS 886H or
   886I items that are maintained within the medical unit, facility security services should be
   sufficient.

                                             Chapter 2

                                   CASUALTY PREVENTION

2.1. Casualty Prevention Overview. AFMS CBRN defense operations are organized in terms
of two FHP concepts: casualty prevention and casualty care. Casualty prevention focuses on
preventing casualties from environmental, occupational, operational, and CBRN threats.
Casualty prevention through passive defense and tactical surveillance is an integral part of
counter-CBRN defense operations. Passive defense protects personnel from the effects of a
CBRN attack and improves the capability of personnel to survive and sustain operations in a
CBRN environment. Passive defense consists of contamination avoidance, protection, and
contamination control. Medical surveillance forms a basis for medical resource allocation,
refines knowledge of the health threat, and allows continual assessment of the effectiveness of
measures used to prevent and control disease and non-battle injuries (DNBI). Casualty
prevention activities help provide installation commanders with the best available health-based
risk assessment of an incident. Historically, well-trained medical providers have been able to
help identify biological and chemical induced incidents well before other surveillance methods.
Casualty prevention measures encompass pre-incident, incident, and post-incident phases of a
CBRN event.

2.2. Pre-Incident Planning. CBRN agents may be dispersed on or near an installation overtly
or covertly. Overt incidents generally produce a signature that alerts personnel to the incident,
but a covert release may not be detected until casualties present to medical facilities. Medical
unit MCRPs should include processes and procedures for responding to overt and covert CBRN
incidents. Casualty prevention planning for terrorist CBRN threat response must begin long
before an incident occurs. Plans must be reviewed, tested, revised, and disseminated as the need
arises. Pre-incident planning should include the following activities.

     2.2.1. Disease Surveillance. Disease surveillance aids in early identification of covert
     biological attacks and endemic disease outbreaks. PH shall conduct disease and syndromic
     surveillance on a daily basis. The single most effective tool for identifying and targeting
     health hazards is a robust health surveillance and DNBI monitoring and reporting system.
     PH should educate all providers on the importance of accurate reporting, standardized
     coding, and follow-up. They shall monitor trends based on coding data in the Ambulatory
     Data Module (ADM) of the Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application
     (AHLTA) electronic health record system. For monitoring to be effective, clinicians should
     code each day’s patient encounters the same day. Other indicators may be detected through
     ancillary support functions such as pharmacy, laboratory, and radiology. Monitoring these
     data sources is critical to health-based risk assessment and may produce the first indication of
     a biological agent attack.

        2.2.1.1. Examples of medical surveillance software include AHLTA and Executive
        Information Decision Support (EIDS) Electronic Surveillance System for the Early
        Notification of Community-based Epidemics (ESSENCE).
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 23

     2.2.1.2. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Smallpox Response Plan
     and Guidelines, Version 3.0, provides guidelines on public health strategies and actions
     required for federal, state, and local public health officials during a smallpox emergency.
     This document is available on the CDC’s website at the following URL:
     http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/response-plan/index.asp

  2.2.2. Awareness Training. Medical units should ensure that healthcare providers are well-
  trained in recognizing the symptoms of biological, radiological, and chemical agent
  exposures to facilitate the early identification of CBRN incidents. (See AFI 41-106 for a list
  of required training.)

  2.2.3. Vulnerability Assessments. Medical units should obtain and disseminate at the
  appropriate level applicable Hazard Vulnerabilty Analysis (HVA), TIC/TIM vulnerability
  assessments and intelligence, including food and water vulnerability assessments. Preventive
  medicine and facility medical personnel will use the results of these assessments to help
  focus their planning efforts as well as exercise and training programs. PH and BE will assess
  the threat of intentional contamination of food and water using available classified and
  unclassified intelligence sources (i.e., AFOSI data, FBI, ,Defense Intelligence Agency’s
  [DIA] National Center for Medical Intelligence [NCMI]).

  2.2.4. Personal Protective Equipment. Each medical unit must provide the appropriate
  PPE for all medical first responders or first receivers and other pre-identified trained
  personnel based on threat level, identified hazards associated with the event, and the type of
  work the individual is expected to perform in the hazardous environment. Each medic or
  MCRP team member acting as a first responder/first receiver should have grab and go access
  to the appropriate PPE. Examples of personnel who may require CBRN PPE include the
  BEE team, primary triage team (who triage patients before entering the patient
  decontamination area), patient decontamination team, and manpower/security and
  decontamination support teams working in the patient decontamination zone. This PPE
  provides basic protection against the vast majority of CBRN agents or blood-borne
  pathogens. Specific PPE use requirements can be modified based on threat levels and
  conditions as determined by the BEE and the IC. MC-CBRN AS 886A, 886H, 886I, 886K,
  and 886M provide HAZMAT PPE for MCRP teams. Other teams, such as the FRT, require
  universal precautions such as gloves, goggles, and surgical masks. MC-CBRN AS 886J and
  886L contain these supplies.

  2.2.5. Respiratory Protection. BEE is the authority on the selection, use, fit-testing, and
  limitations of respiratory protection. Respiratory protection that meets the definition of
  uniquely military equipment IAW the requirements of Executive Order (EO) 12196,
  Occupational Safety and Health Programs for Federal Employees, and Title 29, Code of
  Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 1960, Basic Program Elements for Federal Employee
  Occupational Safety and Health Programs and Related Matters, Section 2, Definitions
  (29CFR1960.2), can be used during uniquely military operations. Individuals who are
  required to wear National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) approved
  respirators must be enrolled in the installation RPP IAW Air Force Occupational Safety and
24                                                         AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

     Health Standard (AFOSHSTD) 48-137, Respiratory Protection Program. BEE team
     members may be required to don a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

     2.2.6. Protective Clothing. BE provides subject matter expertise on the selection, use, and
     limitations of protective clothing. Protective clothing that meets the definition of uniquely
     military equipment IAW the requirements of EO 12196 and 29 CFR1960.2 can be used
     during uniquely military operations. BE will determine the appropriate level of protection
     following the guidance in Title 29, CFR, Part 1910, Occupational Safety and Health
     Standards, Section 120, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response, Appendix B,
     General Description and Discussion of the Levels of Protection and Protective Gear
     (29CFR1910.120).

     2.2.7. Pre-Exposure Preparation. Pre-exposure preparation is a preventive approach to
     help individuals prepare for and cope with potentially traumatic incidents. Pre-exposure
     preparation focuses on effective approaches to trauma stress management and emphasizes
     resiliency and the normalcy of feeling stress under abnormal circumstances. Pre-exposure
     preparation training should be coordinated between unit leaders and the traumatic crisis
     response team chief.

     2.2.8. Occupational and Environmental Health (OEH) Hazards. BE provides expertise
     in responding to and identifying, analyzing, and controlling exposures to OEH hazards. AS
     886H provides the necessary equipment. Other functional organizations such as CE
     readiness and emergency management (R&EM), explosive ordnance disposal (EOD), and
     fire department may provide similar capability.

2.3. Incident Response. Medical units should train, organize, and equip personnel to execute a
medical CBRN response. The AFRC BEE team should plan for approximately an 8-hour limited
duration due to base-specific limiting factors. Casualty prevention measures include proper
personal protection for responders, preventing or minimizing the spread of contamination,
detecting and identifying CBRN agents, toxic cordon management, providing risk management
(RM) advice to the IC, and monitoring and documenting exposure levels for personal health
records.

     2.3.1. Overt Incidents. An overt CBRN or toxic industrial material (TIM) incident
     typically alerts personnel and prompts an immediate, appropriate response from installation
     agencies. Personnel should be aware that an event might not initially be reported as one
     involving CBRN or TIM agents.

        2.3.1.1. The Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS) will be used to manage a
        CBRN incident IAW the installation’s IEMP 10-2. The senior fire official is normally
        designated the IC in charge of the scene under the ICS and is responsible for establishing
        an upwind ICP, ECP, staging areas, and contamination control zones.

        2.3.1.2. Medical teams do not enter the warm or hot zone at the incident site. However,
        at many installations, the BE and CE teams may establish a combined entry team to
        detect, identify, quantify, and assess CBRN hazards in the hot zone.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                    25



     2.3.1.3. All medical response teams will activate IAW local notification and activation
     procedures and report to the IC as directed. Manning and materiel requirements should
     be requested through the IC.

     2.3.1.4. A senior medical unit representative (or BE/PH team member for AFRC bases)
     will report to the installation EOC and serve as the ESF #8 – Public Health and Medical
     Services official for PH and medical services. This person facilitates communications
     between the EOC and the MCC and is responsible for keeping the MCC informed of
     medical operations. These communications must flow from the IC who then
     communicates with ESF #8 at the EOC. A second medical unit representative may be
     required to report to the EOC to serve as the ESF #11 – Agriculture and Natural
     Resources official for agriculture and natural resources. A PH and BE representative
     may also be appointed to the EOC.

     2.3.1.5. The medical unit commander or a designated senior medical unit representative
     will be a part of the Crisis Action Team (CAT). Senior representatives from key
     installation organizations report to the ICC where they advise the installation commander
     on strategic actions and liaison with higher headquarters (HHQ) and civilian agencies.

     2.3.1.6. If an incident occurs and CBRN is suspected, BE personnel will respond with
     CE responders using an all-hazards approach and monitor for the presence of
     radiological, chemical, and biological contaminants. Following a positive detection, the
     BE will attempt to identify the specific material used to ensure that victims receive
     appropriate treatment and to assist in RM decisions.

     2.3.1.7. Agent identification may require the collection of field samples to send to
     appropriate laboratories for analysis. Samples of suspected biological agents will be
     transported to the designated LBDT, LRN, or national laboratory for analysis.

     2.3.1.8. FES will develop a toxic cordon plume model and R&EM will develop a toxic
     corridor plume model. The BE will advise the IC on appropriate modifications to the
     basic cordon established by SF and the fire department based on the physical
     characteristics and toxicology of the material identified, meteorological conditions, and
     the outcome of appropriate toxic cordon plume models (when available). The BE will
     also provide inputs on appropriate actions to take within the established corridor to
     include shelter in place or evacuation.

     2.3.1.9. BE will advise the IC on appropriate RM to protect response personnel and to
     avoid additional casualties within the installation populace. Note: The commander
     should consider health risk input in the context of RM as part of the overall decision
     process. The following RM actions are required:

        2.3.1.9.1. BE will accomplish an HRA IAW AFI 48-145. The HRA will be provided
        to the IC to assist with decision making and casualty prevention strategies.
26                                                       AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

        2.3.1.9.2. Based on the HRA, the BE will advise the IC on the appropriate PPE for
        response personnel IAW AFOSHSTD 48-137 and AFA 91-202, The US Air Force
        Mishap Prevention Program. These recommendations will take into consideration the
        protection required and the operational needs of the situation. Overly conservative
        requirements can hinder mission effectiveness, tax resources, and may add needless
        stress on emergency responders.

        2.3.1.9.3. BE will advise on-scene response personnel, including the IC, on the health
        risks identified and the appropriate control measures. Additionally, the BE will
        liaison with and solicit input as necessary from PH, PHEO, mental health, and the
        installation public affairs (PA) office.

        2.3.1.9.4. During a biological agent incident, PH will create appropriate reports,
        conduct epidemiological analysis, and provide countermeasure, casualty prevention,
        and risk communication recommendations to the installation PHEO IAW AFI 10-
        2603, Emergency Health Powers on Air Force Installation, AFI 10-2604, Disease
        Containment Planning, and the installation disease containment plan.

        2.3.1.9.5. The PHEO, if trained and certified may be designated as the IC during a
        public health emergency and is a principle advisor to the installation commander in
        such incidents.

        2.3.1.9.6. BE will work with the installation emergency manager and FES to develop
        methods to reduce the spread of contamination from the incident to other areas on the
        installation. These actions may include decontamination of personnel and equipment,
        marking contaminated areas, and the application of water or other suppressants to
        plumes.

     2.3.1.10. The manpower/security team should secure the medical unit and the area
     immediately around the medical unit by doing the following:

        2.3.1.10.1. Secure the facility and limit access to control entry for staff and patients
        to a predetermined point of entry.

        2.3.1.10.2. Blockade vehicle access to parts of the medical unit except for a pre-
        determined arrival path for ambulances and vehicles.

        2.3.1.10.3. If necessary, close the ventilation intake louvers to prevent contaminants
        from entering the ventilation system.

        2.3.1.10.4. Provide security outside the medical unit to the patient decontamination
        area.

        2.3.1.10.5. Post guards and maintain general security throughout the medical unit.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                        27

           2.3.1.10.6. Based on the risk to personnel, the security team may need to use their
           assigned PPE when working outside the medical unit.

   2.3.2. Covert Incidents. A covert incident may not become evident until patients
   experience symptoms and report to the medical facility. The link between their illness and an
   intentional CBRN release may not be readily apparent. Patients may present in mass from a
   common source exposure or trickle in due to a propagated outbreak, as might be the case
   with exposure to a BW agent such as smallpox.

       2.3.2.1. The first line of defense in the medical unit is a well-trained medical staff that
       recognizes the syndromes related to CBRN agent exposure and commonality of
       symptoms among dissimilar patients.

       2.3.2.2. The next line of defense is a disease/syndromic surveillance system that track the
       incidence of selected diseases and syndromes on a daily basis. Surveillance systems
       currently in place include EIDS ESSENCE. This system monitors patient diagnoses in
       the medical unit ADM on a daily basis and reports clusters or incidence rates that exceed
       historical averages to the PHO.

       2.3.2.3. PH personnel liaison with the local community public health agency to share
       disease and syndromic surveillance data that may assist in the early detection of a
       biological outbreak. PH investigates the clusters to determine if an outbreak is occurring
       using standard epidemiological outbreak investigation methods.

       2.3.2.4. PH will request support from the BEE team if an outbreak investigation links the
       outbreak to suspected CBRN activity or food/water contamination. The BEE or PHO is
       responsible for notifying the medical chain of command, to include the PHEO, of a
       suspected CBRN event IAW local protocols. The medical unit commander will direct the
       appropriate medical unit response and recommend to the installation commander, as
       appropriate, implementation of the DCP and activation of the ICC and EOC. The PHO
       or PHEO may assume IC in such instances.

2.4. Post-Incident Recovery Actions. Casualty prevention activities associated with post-
incident recovery include risk communication, expanded medical surveillance of exposed
personnel, crisis response team actions, and CBRN contamination avoidance and control. These
activities assist the installation with reestablishing normal operations and help ensure the health
of the installation populace.

   2.4.1. Health Risk Communication. Health risk communication ensures responders
   operate in a safe environment by minimizing their risk of unnecessary exposure. It helps
   prevent the public from receiving misinformation that may result in panic and minimizes the
   number of worried well presenting to medical facilities. Medical personnel should provide
   clear, consistent, understandable information to patients, visitors, medical group staff, and the
   general public. The installation public affairs officer (PAO) must ensure that risk
   communication messages have been vetted through the PHEO or PHO and are consistent
   with those provided to the community by local civilian agencies. Conflicting information
28                                                            AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

     leads to confusion, frustration, and loss of public confidence. Medical personnel must
     communicate personnel exposure risks to commanders to assist commanders in their ORM-
     based decisions.

     2.4.2. Expanded Medical Surveillance. A highly focused medical surveillance program is
     critical to casualty prevention during post-incident recovery. Continuous disease/syndromic
     surveillance enable the medical unit and local community healthcare facilities to quickly
     identify and treat new cases related to the CBRN incident. For contagious agents,
     surveillance efforts drive isolation and quarantine requirements to prevent further exposures.
     Surveillance activities help identify exposed members to protect responders and other
     healthcare staff from spreading contamination and contracting disease.

     2.4.3. Crisis Response Team. Crisis response is designed and developed to provide
     psychological first aid services to the installation as needed. As a reactive service, the crisis
     response team provides advisory, consultative, and direct intervention and support to
     emergency response personnel, victims, and others at the scene after an encounter with a
     critical incident or natural/man-made disaster. The function of the crisis response team is to
     lessen the emotional and psychological impact of critical incidents on response team and
     emergency services personnel, victims, and others at the scene who have witnessed a
     potentially traumatic event. The support the crisis response team offers is designed to
     accelerate the return of personnel to routine functions after the incident. Members of the
     crisis response team are specially trained and appointed in writing and include personnel
     from mental health and various installation support services (e.g., chaplain, family services).

     2.4.4. Contamination Avoidance and Control. An important aspect in restoring normal
     operations is determining the location and extent of contamination. The IC, with
     consultation from BE and other officials and agencies as appropriate, determines the most
     effective method to manage contamination. Contamination avoidance, supported by
     detection and surveillance measures, should be implemented if the extent or nature of the
     contamination is such that effective decontamination is not feasible. Contamination control
     through barriers and decontamination operations should be implemented if the extent and
     nature of the contamination is such that effective decontamination can be accomplished.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                    29

                                CASUALTY MANAGEMENT

3.1. Casualty Management Overview. A CBRN incident creates several unique challenges for
response personnel not normally encountered during routine operations. For example, medical
units may encounter large numbers of casualties as well as large numbers of individuals with
psychological stress reactions. Casualty care operations may include patient decontamination,
triage, clinical care, patient movement on the installation and to off-installation healthcare
facilities, restriction of movement and quarantine, and AE. Response to a CBRN event should
follow established guidelines for mass casualty response IAW Air Force Doctrine Document
(AFDD) 4-02, Health Services; FM 4-02.7/MCRP 4-11.1F/NTTP 4-02.7/AFTTP 3-42.3; and
AFI 10-2603. This chapter addresses specific actions medical units must take to effectively
prepare for, respond to, and recover from CBRN incidents that result in casualties.

3.2. Pre-Incident Preparation and Planning. IAW AFI 41-106, all medical units must
develop an MCRP (ANG planning is included in the wing’s IEMP) to address the threat of a
CBRN event, taking into consideration local threat, mission, capabilities of facilities, and
community resources. Contracts, MAAs, MOAs, and MOUs should be developed as appropriate
to cover contingencies and services not provided by the medical unit. These documents must be
reviewed by the MRO and PHEO to ensure any gaps in response planning are sufficiently
mitigated.

   3.2.1. Medical Unit Responsibilities. Medical units must be capable of self-sustainment in
   the early phases of a CBRN event and must plan for the following:

       3.2.1.1. Medical operations at the scene to include surveillance, triage, life-saving
       actions, and transport.

       3.2.1.2. Medical operations at the medical unit to include decontamination, surveillance,
       triage, diagnosis, and treatment.

       3.2.1.3. Patients who present at the medical unit without on-scene treatment or
       decontamination (e.g., patients who bypassed the scene control or left the scene before
       control was established).

       3.2.1.4. Inundation of anxious patients (worried well) and other psychological casualties
       who may or may not have had contact with the contaminant.

       3.2.1.5. Risk communication strategies to address the likelihood of public anxiety and
       panic.

       3.2.1.6. Provision of chemical and biological agent countermeasures and prophylaxis to
       first responders and incident casualties either at the scene or at a dispensing sites.
30                                                           AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

        3.2.1.7. Procedures for maintaining visibility on all pharmaceuticals to include accurate
        and current inventories and lists of storage locations (peacetime pharmacy, AS 886E, and
        war reserve materiel [WRM]).

        3.2.1.8. Procedures for requesting assets (pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, equipment)
        from the SNS through the DOD or the respective community or state health departments.
        See AFI 10-2603 for more information.

        3.2.1.9. Setup and operation of points of dispensing sites for dispensing emergency
        medications or prophylaxis.

        3.2.1.10. Setup of temporary first aid/screening facilities to isolate potentially infectious
        patients and lessen the impact on patient operations at the medical unit.

        3.2.1.11. Provision of 24-hour security to the medical unit, patient decontamination area,
        and point of dispensing to control personnel and vehicle traffic and prevent
        contamination from entering the medical unit.

     3.2.2. Cooperative Agreements. The potential magnitude of a CBRN event and limited
     staffing resources at medical units due to Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) rotations
     and down-sizing in recent years requires establishment of cooperative relationships with
     local community emergency response agencies (hospitals, emergency medical services
     (EMS), health departments, and other emergency management organizations). MAAs,
     MOAs, and MOUs are the tools used to establish agreements between the medical unit and
     community agencies. These agreements require annual reviews and regular updates based on
     the availability of resources for response operations. To ensure agreements remain effective,
     medical units are encouraged to implement the following recommendations:

        3.2.2.1. Assign a member of the staff (provider or senior nurse) along with the MRO,
        PHEO, or PHO to represent the medical unit at the community’s local emergency
        planning committee (LEPC), health department, EMS, or hospital association. If no such
        organization exists, assist other community hospitals and emergency management
        organizations in developing one.

        3.2.2.2. Regularly attend LEPC, health department, EMS, or hospital association
        meetings to keep abreast of changes in response capabilities within the community.

        3.2.2.3. The MR office coordinates and updates comprehensive MAAs, MOAs, and
        MOUs with local hospitals and other emergency response agencies. As part of this
        planning process, ensure the applicable annexes of the MCRP that task or impact local
        response agencies are updated.

        3.2.2.4. PH serves as a liaison between the installation and local health agencies for
        communicable disease programs and public health emergency management planning.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                      31

       3.2.2.5. Whenever possible, participate in or invite local emergency response agencies to
       participate in CBRN exercises that incorporate Homeland Security Exercise and
       Evaluation Program (HSEEP) standards.

3.3. Planning Considerations. Planning considerations should include managing a large influx
of patients, ambulance support services, evidence preservation, mortuary affairs, and PA. See
Chapter 2 for more information on PPE and other personal protection measures.

   3.3.1. Preparing for a Large Influx of Patients. Executive management must make early
   decisions about existing plans for providing health care. When the number of patients
   exceeds the number of available beds, staffing, or capabilities, executive management must
   assess whether to implement alternative or back-up resources. These resources should be
   identified in the MCRP. Plans must be in accordance with and complement the installation
   IEMP as well as any applicable local, state (e.g., Emergency Operations Plan), and national
   (e.g., National Response Framework) plans. The following recommendations can assist
   leadership in prioritizing requirements and networking patient needs with local facilities.

       3.3.1.1. Determine whether a hospital in the community has been designated as a CBRN
       medical unit or whether all hospitals will share equally in the influx of patients.
       Document each hospital’s function in the appropriate MAA, MOA, or MOU.

       3.3.1.2. Establish conditions in which to implement the MCRP.

       3.3.1.3. Determine when to cancel non-emergency surgeries and other elective
       procedures or temporarily suspend outpatient care.

       3.3.1.4. Consider discharging non-contagious patients without compromising the quality
       of care.

       3.3.1.5. Consider discharging patients to other healthcare facilities out of the affected
       geographical area, to long-term care facilities, or to home care as appropriate.

       3.3.1.6. Consider discharging patients with communicable diseases when appropriate.
       Provide specific discharge instructions that include recommendations for caregiver
       protection, hand washing, disinfection of the environment, and post-mortem care.

       3.3.1.7. Determine the availability and sources (e.g., SNS, Veterans Administration) of
       additional medical equipment such as ventilators, intravenous (IV) pumps, and other
       medical equipment.

       3.3.1.8. Brief the IC and implement incident status reports IAW the MCRP.

       3.3.1.9. Establish liaison with community partners (e.g., LEPC, health department, EMS,
       hospitals, and emergency management agencies).
32                                                          AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

        3.3.1.10. Coordinate healthcare activities with the agencies on the installation IAW the
        installation’s DCP for isolation and quarantine of affected/infected personnel as needed.

        3.3.1.11. Implement a risk communications plan through a designated medical PAO for
        staff, visitors, current patients, and the installation PAO (consider development of
        educational handouts, etc).

        3.3.1.12. Coordinate surveillance activities with local, state, and federal public health
        resources for pre-incident and post-incident exposure and effect tracking.

        3.3.1.13. Provide pre-exposure preparation services IAW AFI 44-153, Traumatic Stress
        Response, if possible.

        3.3.1.14. For installations without a laboratory team, establish points of contact and
        procedures with the AFOSI and possibly the FBI for sending samples to an approved
        LRN laboratory for confirmatory analysis. If the LRN will not accept environmental
        samples, establish alternative procedures for confirmatory analysis.

        3.3.1.15. Establish a temporary site or alternate medical facility (e.g., gym, medical
        reserve center) to stage patients until they can be transported to other hospitals or
        healthcare facilities. Also plan for converting offices or non-patient treatment areas to
        bed space as appropriate. If the CBRN event affects the surrounding community as well,
        the local hospitals may be overwhelmed and unable to accept patients initially.

     3.3.2. Ambulance Considerations. Many medical units no longer have ambulance service.
     Installations with ambulance service use the ambulances to respond to in-flight emergencies
     and possibly the incident site. However, some do not transport patients to local hospitals.
     Instead, they rely on local community ambulance services through contracts or MAAs,
     MOAs, or MOUs. The following provisions should be considered regardless of whether the
     installation has organic ambulance service or relies on community ambulance support:

        3.3.2.1. Installation MAAs, MOAs, and MOUs must include local EMS access to the
        installation during increased FPCON.

        3.3.2.2. Medical units with contract ambulance services should ensure that CBRN
        response actions are included in contract statements of work. Ensure procedures are in
        place to transport patients who may not have undergone gross decontamination at the
        scene.

        3.3.2.3. Ambulance crews commonly configure their response equipment and supplies
        based on local policies. This AFTTP does not alter that practice. However, it is required
        that local EMS and ambulance services, in the course of their response training, clearly
        identify which medical care equipment EMS personnel will take when responding to the
        incident. Examples include airway management bags, oxygen delivery systems, trauma
        bags, and advanced life support (ALS) medication bags.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 33

     3.3.2.4. Individual medical units should consider configuring a CBRN response bag with
     patient care items that can be stored in a dedicated ambulance compartment. These bags
     should be configured from AS 886J (FRT capability).

     3.3.2.5. Each ambulance should be equipped with patient covers and blankets for
     ambulatory and litter patients after the decontamination process. The ambulance should
     have sturdy plastic bags for contaminated clothing and infectious waste bags to contain
     items contaminated with blood or other body fluids.

     3.3.2.6. Decontamination of vehicles may be necessary before returning to normal
     services after the incident. Contaminated vehicles may be out of service for an extended
     period of time depending on the nature of the contamination.

  3.3.3. Evidence Preservation. In some cases, the AFOSI may require collection of exposed
  clothing and other potential evidence such as decontamination run-off. Biological specimens
  (e.g., blood, urine, food) from casualties may need to be treated as evidence under certain
  circumstances. The medical unit commander should establish policies and procedures for
  evidence preservation and labeling and inventory of a patient’s effects. Procedures for the
  retrieval, handling, securing, and disposition of a patient’s weapons (e.g., guns, knives,
  syringes) should be developed IAW AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force
  Personnel, AFMAN 31-229, USAF Weapons Handling Manual, and local procedures. Strict
  chain-of-custody protocols must be established and followed.

  3.3.4. Management of Human Remains. Management of human remains is primarily an
  Air Force mortuary affairs responsibility. The medical unit in conjunction with mortuary
  affairs and the local community should pre-determine responsibilities and procedures for
  transporting remains from the scene. Additional considerations include when and where a
  provider will certify death during a mass casualty situation, morgue capacity, and alternate
  facilities determinations. The medical unit commander, in coordination with BE, PHO,
  PHEO, and the infection control officer, should advise mortuary affairs personnel on the type
  of contamination, health hazards, and measures to prevent the spread of disease and
  contamination. Local initial decontamination procedures and collection points for
  contaminated remains may need to be established. Contaminated remains should not be
  transported in an ambulance and should not be transported to the medical unit.
  Arrangements should be made to store contaminated casualties in other areas (perhaps
  refrigerated trucks) until the Army Human Remains Decontamination Team arrives. The
  patient decontamination team does not decontaminate human remains. See JP 4-06,
  Mortuary Affairs in Joint Operations, for more information.

  3.3.5. Internal Communication. It is imperative that the MCC keep the medical unit staff
  informed about the incident, its progress, and any other items of interest. In a chaotic
  situation, the medical staff may be insulated from the response effort as they treat incoming
  patients. To avoid rumors and other distractions that may adversely affect the morale and
  ability of medical staff to perform, the MCC should provide regular updates to the staff.

     3.3.6. Public Affairs and the Media. CBRN incidents will draw media attention. It is
     critical that the medical unit work with the installation PAO to assess the public’s need and
     right to know against security concerns and patients’ privacy rights when responding to the
     media.

        3.3.6.1. The PHEO/PHO is typically the medical unit contact for providing medically
        related information on response, medical effects, and countermeasures to the installation
        PA office for release to the media.

        3.3.6.2. The media may want to interview a healthcare provider or representative from
        the medical unit. Any contact with the media must be coordinated through the medical
        unit commander and the installation PAO.

        3.3.6.3. BE, PH, aerospace medicine, and mental health can be invaluable in preparing
        press releases and public statements. Their expertise can help identify people who need
        to report for medical evaluation and calm the concerns of those who do not.

        3.3.6.4. Any joint medical response conducted with community partners should also
        consider coordinating risk communications efforts to the public to minimize conflicting
        statements.

3.4. Overview of MC-CBRN Response Operations. Figure 3.1 shows the basic MC-CBRN
response operations and patient flow in a controlled environment. The MC-CBRN response
capability is comprised of the MC-CBRN 886 AS and existing MCRP teams. The MCRP
contains MC-CBRN response procedures and checklists.

  3.4.1. Security Perimeters. The installation’s SF establishes and controls the perimeter
  around the incident. Hot, warm, and cold zones are established. The manpower/security
  team controls all entry points into the medical unit to prevent unauthorized or contaminated
  individuals from entering the medical unit.

  3.4.2. First Responders. The FRT (e.g., ambulance services) responds to the scene and
  requests additional FRT support as needed.

  3.4.3. Health Risk Assessments. The BEE team provides HRA IAW AFI 48-145.

  3.4.4. Patient Decontamination. The patient decontamination team sets up the
  decontamination system to process casualties who self-report to the medical unit who have
  not been decontaminated at the scene or who need further decontamination. Triage team
  members are positioned at the entrance and exit of the decontamination area to triage
  casualties. (See Chapter 15 for ANG CONOPS.)

  3.4.5. Emergency Operations Center. The EOC is established to provide resources and
  support to the IC. A medical representative is normally assigned to provide medical
  emergency support functions. The EOC may also include a BEE team representative and the
  PHEO if requested or designated by the installation IEMP as part of the ESF.

  3.4.6. Entry Control Point. An ECP is established at the scene. Everyone going into and
  out of the hot zone must process through the decontamination corridor. FES manages and
  ensures gross decontamination of casualties leaving the ECP.
36                                                          AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013



     3.4.7. Casualty Flow. In the cold zone, after gross decontamination, FRT members perform
     casualty triage and stabilization. Casualties are then transported to the installation or local
     medical facility where they are re-triaged and handed off to triage or clinical teams. Note:
     Casualties who have undergone proper gross decontamination at the scene (e.g., removal of
     clothing, showering/washing with water) do not require additional decontamination by the
     patient decontamination team. Patient flow for casualties transported from the field should
     avoid the patient decontamination warm zone to prevent re-contaminating the patient or
     ambulance crews.

     3.4.8. MCRP Team Functions. The clinical, administrative, laboratory, pharmacy, and
     other MCRP teams perform their roles inside the medical unit.

     3.4.9. Point of Distribution Functions. Upon activation, the point of distribution team
     performs their roles at the point of dispensing site, usually outside the medical unit.

3.5. MC-CBRN Operations at the Incident Site. CBRN response is managed IAW AFIMS
guidance. First responders may or may not know they are dealing with a CBRN incident when
the call comes into the dispatch center. The senior fire officer (known as the IC) is in charge of
the scene and is responsible for establishing the hot, warm, and cold zones. However, medical
responders initially stage in the cold zone at the ECP and initiate communication with the IC.
Medical personnel are not permitted to enter the warm or hot zone with the exception of BE.
Every attempt will be made to keep ambulances from entering the warm or hot zones. If an
ambulance enters these areas, either intentionally or unintentionally, it must remain there until
otherwise directed by the IC in consultation with BE. Field triage and treatment is IAW
established guidance. See paragraph 3.7 for triage and treatment references.

     3.5.1. Initial Response. All Air Force medical units providing ambulance service must
     accomplish the following medical actions on-scene:

        3.5.1.1. Obtain all available information concerning the nature of the event and identify a
        safe route. Considerations include the ECP location, HAZMAT potential, and wind
        direction.

        3.5.1.2. Report to the IC at the ECP and advise the IC on medical operations and
        concerns.

        3.5.1.3. Request additional resources as needed. Route requests for additional support
        from local medical units (military or civilian) as well as notifications of anticipated
        casualties through the IC. The IC will then contact the EOC Director, if available, to
        forward the information to the MCC. This notification can help alert medical facilities to
        implement their facility security procedures in anticipation of the potential arrival of
        contaminated patients who may have already left the scene.

     3.5.2. Emergency Decontamination. FES will extricate victims and perform gross
     decontamination on potentially contaminated personnel in the warm zone IAW AFMAN 10-
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                    37

   2503. Patients will then be turned over to on-scene medical personnel at the CCP in the cold
   zone. For guidance on proper decontamination procedures (particularly for severely injured
   patients), fire department personnel should consult with the senior medical representative at
   the incident site by radio before decontaminating the patient.

   3.5.3. Patient Identification and Tracking. Medical units must implement a patient
   identification and tracking mechanism. This tracking mechanism must be pre-planned with
   all possible responding medical facilities in the local area and fulfill HHS and FBI
   requirements. The FBI assumes the lead role in the response with HHS as a supporting
   agency. A patient administration team is responsible for tracking patients. The patient
   administration team responds with the FRT to the incident site to track patients who are
   transported by EMS to a hospital in the community. This patient tracking information is
   needed for keeping the medical group commander and installation commander informed of
   their status. This information will also be valuable for the notification of next of kin.

   3.5.4. Transporting Casualties. The senior medical representative at the incident site,
   working through the IC, will direct patients to either a military or civilian medical unit based
   on patient acuity, contagiousness, suspected contamination, and the availability and
   capabilities of local treatment facilities. Factors in these decisions include the
   appropriateness of the situation and whether FPCON measures permit movement of patients
   on and off the installation. Medical units with limited or no ambulance services for moving
   casualties from the incident site to an on-installation medical unit may choose to use vehicles
   of opportunity. The medical unit may arrange for mass transportation of casualties, if
   appropriate, through the vehicle control officer (VCO) or logistics readiness squadron at the
   installation.

   3.5.5. Medications and Prophylaxis. If necessary, the senior medical representative may
   order emergency medications and prophylaxis for all potentially exposed emergency
   responders at the scene. AS 886E sub-assemblage PD provides prophylaxis and antidotes for
   first responders. If circumstances at the incident warrant a more comprehensive mass
   prophylaxis response, the senior medical representative should consult with the PHEO to
   recommend activating the installation’s mass prophylaxis dispensing plan IAW the DCP and
   MCRP.

3.6. MC-CBRN Operations at the Medical Unit. Although smaller medical units may not be
the primary receiving facility for patients arriving from the scene of an incident, all medical
groups should train, equip, and plan to sustain at least 24 continuous hours of patient care
without outside assistance. A patient may present at the front door of the facility regardless of
the capability or capacity of the medical unit. Smaller medical units may need to establish
temporary extended patient care capabilities in the medical unit or an alternate medical facility
using the limited resources and capability available until patient transport can be arranged. See
Chapter 16 for ANG MC-CBRN operational guidelines.

   3.6.1. Operational Procedures for Field Triaged Patients. Medical units should
   implement the following procedures for patients arriving at the medical unit after triage,
   gross decontamination, and initial treatment at the scene:
38                                                           AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013



        3.6.1.1. Execute plan to receive patients at the medical unit.

        3.6.1.2. Deliver patients to the medical decontamination site, if needed.

        3.6.1.3. Monitor and medically decontaminate as necessary IAW Attachment 4, Patient
        Decontamination Procedures.

        3.6.1.4. Initiate patient tracking mechanisms.

        3.6.1.5. Re-triage and provide appropriate immediate care.

        3.6.1.6. Deliver patients to the appropriate treatment teams.

     3.6.2. Operational Procedures for Self-Reporting Patients. Patients may arrive at the
     medical unit who did not receive treatment at the scene. Other patients may arrive who are
     experiencing symptoms, but their level of contact with the contaminant is unknown. Medical
     units should implement the following procedures:

        3.6.2.1. Activate the triage team, patient decontamination team, and security/manpower
        team IAW local procedures (e.g., MCRP). The triage team will be split into two teams: a
        primary triage team and a secondary triage team.

            3.6.2.1.1. The primary triage team provides immediate, stabilizing care and
            prioritizes casualties for decontamination and entry into the medical unit. Primary
            triage is based on injury, contamination, available resources, and transport/evacuation
            priority. Note: Consider the vulnerable and special needs population i.e children,
            pregnant women, elderly, disabled and chronically ill.

            3.6.2.1.2. The secondary triage team receives non-contaminated patients or patients
            from the patient decontamination team after decontamination.

        3.6.2.2. Don PPE, as applicable, and set up staging areas.

            3.6.2.2.1. The primary triage team should don Level C PPE after receiving
            notification and establish a triage staging area outside the medical unit (near the
            patient decontamination area) for receiving and triaging patients.

            3.6.2.2.2. The secondary triage team sets up a secondary triage area inside the
            medical unit and does not require Level C PPE.

            3.6.2.2.3. The security/manpower team should don Level C PPE upon activation and
            organize the flow of self-presenters.

        3.6.2.3. Identify contaminated patients and immediately isolate them to avoid cross-
        contamination with non-contaminated patients.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                      39



      3.6.2.4. Monitor and medically decontaminate patients as necessary IAW Attachment 4.

      3.6.2.5. After decontamination, provide patients with a gown or other suitable covering
      and escort them into the secondary triage staging area inside the medical unit. The
      secondary triage team will triage patients based on the injury and available resources.

      3.6.2.6. After secondary triage, deliver patients to the appropriate treatment team
      (minimal, delayed, or immediate) where they will be treated and released or stabilized
      until they can be transported to a designated medical facility for definitive treatment.

   3.6.3. Medical Leadership Responsibilities. During normal duty hours, the medical unit
   commander has availability of all medical unit assets and can use them as needed. After
   normal duty hours, the medical unit will respond with available resources. The medical unit
   commander or designee will evaluate the need for additional staff and establish realistic
   timelines for staff response. The medical unit commander should ensure existing checklists
   and procedures are properly executed to include the following:

      3.6.3.1. Secure the facility and limit and control access in accordance with guidelines
      detailed in MCRP.

      3.6.3.2. Implement facility HVAC systems shutdown as needed.

      3.6.3.3. Establish a facility ECP.

      3.6.3.4. Activate MAAs, MOAs, or MOUs for additional medical support.

      3.6.3.5. Communicate with staff and patients to prevent panic.

      3.6.3.6. Direct CBRN assets for immediate use.

      3.6.3.7. Activate medical unit response/recall to include initial response, triage, crisis
      response, and decontamination teams as appropriate.

3.7. Guidelines for Triage and Treatment of CBRN Casualties. Triage and treatment of
CBRN casualties is IAW the following guidelines:

   3.7.1. Biological Agents. Each medical unit must maintain and manage MC-CBRN
   supplies (antibiotics and vaccines) and plan for distribution and dispensing to include
   requesting additional assets contained in the SNS IAW pre-arranged plans with the
   community and state health departments. Triage, treatment and antibioctic therapy is IAW
   the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID)
   USAMRIID’s Medical Management of Biological Casualties Handbook and current CDC
   guidelines. Training materials are available on the USAMRICD website at the following

     3.7.2. Chemical Agents. Medical units must use AS 886E to treat casualties exposed to
     chemical agents. Triage and treatment is IAW Air Force Joint Manual (AFJMAN) 44-149,
     Treatment of Chemical Agent Casualties and Conventional Military Chemical Injuries;

     Chemical Casualties Handbook. Training materials are available on the USAMRICD
     Chemical Casualty Care Division website at the following URL: https://ccc.apgea.army.mil

     3.7.3. Nuclear/Radiological Agents. Medical units should perform triage and treatment to
     the extent of their capabilities. For guidance, see DOD Manual 3150.8-M, Nuclear Weapon
     Accident Response Procedures (NARP); United States Army Public Health Command
     (USAPHC) Technical Guide (TG) 244, The Medical CBRN Battlebook; and Armed Forces
     Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI) Medical Management of Radiological Casualties
     Handbook. Additional information is available at the Radiation Emergency Medical
     Management (REMM) website at the following URL: http://remm.nlm.gov.

     3.7.4. TIC/TIM Incidents. Medical units should consult the Toxicology Occupational
     Medicines and Environmental Sciences Meditext function, the SDS, and the U.S. Department
     of Transportation (DOT) Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA)
     Emergency Response Guidebook (ERG). Consult the BE/fire department resource officer for
     assistance.

3.8. Post-Incident Recovery Actions. Following a CBRN incident, the medical unit must assist
the installation in re-establishing normal operations and ensure the health of the installation
populace. Many of these activities parallel casualty prevention efforts. This section describes
the post-incident recovery actions specific to casualty management. See Chapter 2 for more
information on post-incident recovery and casualty prevention.

     3.8.1. Health Risk Communication. In most cases, the effects of a CBRN event are not
     limited to the geographical boundaries of the installation. Health risk communication is
     essential to help minimize public fears. To ensure patients, visitors, and the general public
     receive clear, consistent, and understandable information, medical units should develop a
     health risk communication fact sheet and coordinate its distribution through the installation’s
     PA office as soon as possible. Tailored health risk communication efforts must be
     accomplished before re-occupancy of facilities affected by the CBRN incident. Failure to
     provide a public forum for information exchange may increase fear among individuals who
     could attribute non-specific symptoms to the incident. These health risk communication
     efforts focus on managing existing casualties while those of casualty prevention focus on the
     continuing response efforts and response personnel.

     3.8.2. Expanded Medical Surveillance. A detailed accounting of all potentially exposed
     personnel is essential to ensure treatment and follow-up surveillance. Medical units should
     implement a post-exposure surveillance program in cooperation with the lead agency. They
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                               41

  should administer it to all potentially exposed individuals to assess their exposure and
  symptom history. Reference AFI 48-145 defines the LER as a comprehensive exposure
  assessment record of all occupational and environmental exposures for all DoD personnel.
  Document all exposures and treatments using the Defense Occupational and Environmental
  Health Readiness System (DOEHRS).

  3.8.3. Crisis Response Teams. The installation should provide an appropriate team
  composed of representatives from mental health, the chaplain’s office, and the Airmen and
  Family Readiness Center to conduct crisis response. External crisis response staff may also
  be available for assistance when requested. The crisis response team should be prepared to
  provide post-incident intervention to both staff and patients as deemed necessary. Quick
  intervention is critical in restoring responders and quelling patient anxiety and stress.

                                           LOGISTICS

4.1. Medical Logistics Responsibilities. The medical logistics activity provides oversight for
the acquisition, storage, distribution, and maintenance of supplies, pharmaceuticals, and
equipment to support MC-CBRN response based on locally developed policies and procedures.
MCRP team chiefs prepare MCRP checklists and procedures for responding to installation
contingencies with DHP-funded equipment and supplies as well as LAF-funded CBRN
equipment and supplies (MC-CBRN AS). All MC-CBRN assemblages will be managed using
the processes defined in AFI 41-209. These processes provide a systematic method to develop,
change, and review medical allowance standards to ensure they are kept functional and current.

4.2. Allowance Standard (AS) Authorization Levels. MC-CBRN allowance standards are a
minimum authorization for a given module, unlike a WRM AS, which is a standard list of items
and quantities (basis of issue) that cannot be modified locally. AFI 41-106 states that medical
units can modify or tailor the AS levels to enhance their local capabilities based on threat
assessments, medical capabilities, limiting factors and capabilities leveraged through
MOU/MOAs. Reference AFI 41-106 and AF/SG3 tailoring policy memo and guidelines for the
approval process.

4.3. Peacetime Operating Stocks (POS). POS may be used to reduce MC-CBRN
requirements. Medical units should follow the procedures for WRM POS outlined in AFI 41-
209 to calculate and document MC-CBRN POS.

4.4. Accountability. Each MC-CBRN assemblage must be managed and accounted for IAW
AFI 41-106 and AFI 41-209. All allowance standard equipment and supplies will be issued to
the respective team chiefs and property custodians. Once issued, they become the direct
responsibility of the team chief. Team chiefs should always be aware of the status of their MC-
CBRN equipment and supplies. Team chiefs should communicate the condition of equipment
and supplies and replacement needs to medical unit leadership through the MR office. See
Chapter 1 of this AFTTP for more information on team chief responsibilities. See Attachment
11 for a list of each AS and assigned MCRP team.

     4.4.1. Team Chiefs. MCRP team chiefs for patient decontamination (886A), nursing
     services (886D), pharmacy (886E), BE (886H), laboratory biological detection (886I), field
     response (886J), triage (886K), clinical (886L), manpower/security (886M), and public
     health (886P) are appointed in writing and are responsible for establishing and maintaining
     their allowance standard assets. Team chiefs are responsible for initiating all requests for
     materiel and providing input on annual budget submissions for resupply.

     4.4.2. Team Property Custodian. The team chief may serve as the team property custodian
     for the RC/CC account or another team member can be assigned that duty. The team
     property custodian is accountable for all property on the receipt/locator list. The team
     property custodian uses DMLSS and MRDSS to manage the AS.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                     43

4.5. Storage. MC-CBRN assemblages should be stored so they are secure and readily available
for immediate use. If CBRN materiel is temporarily stored in medical logistics warehouses, it
should not be commingled with Air Force Working Capital Fund (AFWCF) inventories. MC-
CBRN assets must be clearly marked and segregated from peacetime and WRM inventories.
Some MC-CBRN assemblages contain medical supplies and equipment with specific storage
requirements.


4.6. Resource Management. MRDSS provides information on the medical readiness status of
MC-CBRN projects. Team chiefs and property custodians are responsible for managing
inventories of their MC-CBRN assets in the DMLSS Assemblage Management module. This
module provides automatic updates to MRDSS.

4.7 Maintenance. Each medical unit must ensure MC-CBRN allowance standards are
operationally maintained IAW AFI 41-209

4.8. Sustainment. Real-world operations, exercises, and training will consume medical
supplies that must be replenished to keep the equipment packages operational. Each team chief
should project annual consumption and submit funding requirements to the MR office. The MR
office will then work with the Resource Management Office (RMO) and MAJCOM PEM for PE
28036F (58036F for ANG units), MC-CBRN Programs, to forecast and distribute sustainment
funds for each team. During the execution year, the MR office will verify the requirements from
each team chief for available funds. If funds are available, the team chief will prioritize and
submit those requirements verified by the MR office to medical logistics for purchase. Team
chiefs may not order sustainment supplies without coordination with the MR office. (See
Chapter 16 for ANG funding requirements.)

   4.8.1. Resupply Funding. Medical units should program and budget for replenishment of
   supplies used during real-world incidents, training, and exercises as well as stock rotation
   and replacement of supplies that cannot be traded in to vendors or used for POS Medical
   units should maintain strict tracking and accountability of all supplies, including those
   obtained from WRM, civilian, or other military caches. Requests for activation of MAAs,
   MOAs, or MOUs to meet projected demand should be relayed to the MCC.

   4.8.2. Projections. Authorization levels or in-stock quantities for all 886 allowance
   standards may at times be insufficient to sustain immediate response (primarily the first 24-
   hours) depending on the scope of the CBRN incident. It is the team chief’s responsibility to
   inform the medical unit commander of identified shortfalls based on valid, credible threats
   and to make recommendations for the procurement of additional equipment and supplies
   required to sustain operations.


   4.8.3. Inventory and Inspection. Conduct inventories and inspections IAW AFI 41-209.
   Team chiefs should ensure that required on-hand quantities are in place. All allowance
   standard supplies and equipment should be inspected to identify any shelf-life coded items
44                                                         AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

     that have expired and to determine whether any items are damaged, inoperable, or
     unserviceable.


     4.8.4. Pharmaceutical Replacement and Stock Rotation. If possible, pharmaceuticals
     within AS 886E should be rotated forward to POS pharmacy stocks. Vendor orders should
     be used to replace supplies in the AS 886E cache. Pharmacies should coordinate with
     medical logistics for items that cannot be kept in the pharmacy due to space limitations or
     inability to rotate through the pharmacy inventory (not on the formulary).

4.9. Incident Response Procedures. The medical logistics activity should perform incident
response actions IAW the local MCRP. If at any time, demand for AS items is projected to
exceed supply, the MCC must be informed immediately of the projected exhaustion time. For
AFRC bases with 886H packages, the EOC must be informed immediately of the projected
exhaustion time. Strict tracking and accountability of all supplies obtained from other sources
(e.g., WRM, civilian responders) must be maintained.

4.10. Post-Incident Response Procedures. Following a response to an incident, each MCRP
team chief must ensure an inventory is conducted per AFI 41-209 to identify materiel shortfalls
or equipment maintenance requirements. Each team property (RC/CC) custodian should submit
requisitions for materiel and request equipment maintenance and repairs to the medical logistics
activity through DMLSS. The logistics activity will acquire, store, distribute, or repair and
maintain equipment based on funds availability and equipment maintenance support. All actions
should be coordinated with the unit MR office.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                         45

                                 TRAINING AND EXERCISES

5.1. Training Overview. The education and training recommended in this AFTTP will impart a
working knowledge of the concepts, principles, and procedures for operating in a CBRN
environment. This education and training addresses the individual, collective, unit, and
leadership skills needed to support installations response requirements. Education, training, and
exercises will be conducted IAW AFI 10-2501, AFI 41-106, AFI 90-201, MAJCOM policy, and
local directives.

   5.1.1. Joint Commission Environment of Care (EC). The Joint Commission EC standards
   require hospitals to develop and implement an emergency management plan (e.g., MCRP)
   that ensures effective response to emergencies affecting the environment of care. The EC
   standards require hospitals to conduct exercises based on plausible scenarios that are realistic
   to the hospital. These exercises should be based on the hazard vulnerability analysis (HVA).
   MCRP training requirements should be established based on CBRN first responder and first
   receiver capabilities using the HVA.

   5.1.2. Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC). The Air Force
   uses the AAAHC for accreditation and guidance requirements for ambulatory care facilities
   (MDGs designated as clinics). AAAHC discusses a requirement for “a comprehensive written
   emergency and disaster preparedness plan to address internal and external emergencies, including
   participating in community health emergency or disaster preparedness, when applicable. The AF
   medical plan is the MCRP The guidance in the AAAHC manual is not specifically for
   military clinics. Therefore, AFI 41-106 remains the overarching guidance for training and
   exercises.

5.2. Specialized Team Training. Team training should be based on the duties and functions
performed by each MCRP team. All medical first responders, first receivers, and supporting
MCRP teams with a funded AS must comply with the training requirements that are specific to
their team and AS, as well as AFI 10-2501. Share good news with the MAJCOM or pilot unit on
AS use, tools, successes, and recommendations as well as AS needs, requests, and ideas for
improvement by elevating through the MR Office.

   5.2.1. Patient Decontamination Team (886A). All medical units must maintain a trained
   cadre with the skills and knowledge to provide initial and refresher training for the entire
   patient decontamination team. The patient decontamination team chief is responsible for
   ensuring all assigned team members remain current in their training and maintain
   proficiency.

       5.2.1.1. Train new team members within 30 days of assignment to the team.

       5.2.1.2. The patient decontamination team chief and alternate must attend a casualty
       decontamination course such as the Patient Decontamination Course conducted at the
       Military Education and Training Center (METC) at Camp Bullis or other Lead
       MAJCOM-approved course. The METC Patient Decontamination Course meets
46                                                          AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

        minimum HAZMAT operations training requirements and is a train-the-trainer course.
        Team chiefs must conduct local team training after course attendance.

        5.2.1.3. At least once each year, include a full setup of the patient decontamination
        system with water hookup, runoff containment, and patient processing. Note: The team
        should demonstrate the proper layout of the wastewater bladder in the containment berm,
        proper placement of the sump pump, and proper connection of the backflow preventer but
        should not let water flow into the bladder during exercises because of the difficulty of
        emptying the bladder afterwards.

     5.2.2. Pharmacy Team (886E). Pharmacy personnel should be fully trained and cognizant
     of their role as outlined in the MCRP. No additional training is necessary beyond the
     training requirements for the pharmacy MCRP team.

     5.2.3. BEE Team (886H). BEE team personnel should be fully trained and cognizant of
     their role as outlined in the MCRP (or base IEMP 10-2 for AFRC bases). Basic technical
     school, upgrade training, readiness skills verification (RSV), unit type code (UTC) training,
     and BEE team training are all pertinent and crucial to ensure a ready response force for
     CBRN incidents.

        5.2.3.1. Training requirements for Air Force medical response teams and HAZMAT
        designed to comply with 29CFR1910.120 and NFPA standards are defined in AFI 10-
        2501.

        5.2.3.2. BEE team personnel must participate in proficiency analytical testing (PAT) for
        CBRN agents. To attain the required level of proficiency necessary for full operational
        capability, team members must receive equipment-specific training that focuses on the
        operation, maintenance, use, and storage of detection and response equipment.

        5.2.3.3. The BEE team should appoint a PAT POC responsible for the following
        functions:

            5.2.3.3.1. Ensure all BEE personnel accomplish electronic proficiency analytical
            challenges (ePAC) and PAT quarterly unknown sample identification (QUSI). Ensure
            timely submission of sampling results to USAFSAM.

            5.2.3.3.2. Forward a list of all BEE personnel required to participate in the PAT
            program to USAFSAM.

            5.2.3.3.3. Whenever HAPSITE or other equipment required for the PAT is not
            operational or significant issues are discovered, contact the BMET and medical
            logistics to request a loaner, if available. (AFRC bases should contact the active duty
            host base’s medical logistics office.)

            5.2.3.3.4. Encourage teamwork and group participation in monthly ePACs and
            ensure personnel complete quarterly PAT QUSI rounds independently.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                47



         5.2.3.3.5. Ensure BE personnel are enrolled in the RPP.

  5.2.4. Laboratory Biological Detection Team (886I). All laboratory personnel who may
  be involved in handling specimens from a suspected or known bioterrorism event or
  infectious disease outbreak must be trained on national LRN policies and procedures and the
  LBDT mission.

     5.2.4.1. The LBDT may train medical unit support staff in proper sample receipt to
     prepare for a high volume of samples and subsequent surge testing that may result from a
     CBRN event. Specimen preparation is the most technically difficult portion of the
     identification process and should only be performed by formally trained individuals. By
     providing additional specialized training to laboratory and other medical staff, surges in
     workflow can be better supported. PH, BE, and first responder personnel require
     appropriate training and must coordinate procedures for interacting with the LBDT to
     include sample collection, submission, preservation, and shipment.

     5.2.4.2. All team members who are required to wear respirators in their roles must enroll
     in the RPP managed by BE. Requirements include completing a medical questionnaire,
     medical approval, and fit-testing for tight-fitting respirators. AS 886I provides tight-
     fitting, disposable particulate filter masks (N-95). Contact BE for more information.

     5.2.4.3. All active duty biomedical laboratory officers (43T3X), enlisted medical
     laboratory personnel (4TX), and government or civilian medical laboratory personnel
     must be competently taught the appropriate handling of clinical and environmental
     samples processed by the LRN and LBDT. This training must be documented in the
     appropriate training record. State health laboratories may provide formal training classes
     for personnel in LRN reference laboratories. Competency assessments will be conducted
     in the same manner as other sets of clinical protocols. The CDC will provide reagents to
     reference and national laboratories.

     5.2.4.4. LBDT personnel must be trained on all LRN sentinel procedures. The LBDT
     chief must ensure that all personnel assigned to perform LRN duties have been trained in
     the CDC technical protocols, notification procedures, and procedures to properly ship
     clinical and environmental samples. All of the necessary protocols are available from the
     American Society for Microbiology (ASM) website at following URL:
     http://www.asm.org

         5.2.4.4.1. The CDC will distribute periodic proficiency testing (PT) samples to all
         LRN reference and national laboratories. The CDC does not distribute PT samples to
         LRN sentinel laboratories.

         5.2.4.4.2. The College of American Pathologists (CAP) distributes a Laboratory
         Preparedness Survey (LPS) that encompasses the LRN sentinel protocols. Each Air
         Force medical unit that maintains an advanced clinical sentinel capability must
         participate in the LPS survey.
48                                                     AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013



     5.2.4.5. The LBDT chief must ensure that all personnel who perform sample testing
     using JBAIDS and M1M receive appropriate training. Personnel assigned to the LBDT
     must be competently trained in the safe handling, processing, testing, and analysis of
     samples (both clinical and environmental) suspected to contain BTAs. This training must
     be documented in the appropriate training record.

        5.2.4.5.1. The U.S. Army Medical Department Center and School (AMEDDC&S)
        has been designated as the lead agent in establishing and conducting the JBAIDS
        Operating Training Course. All LBDT personnel assigned to use JBAIDS must
        attend this 10-day training course and provide a copy of their training certificate to
        their respective MTF medical readiness section. JBAIDS training must be
        documented in each person’s respective training record and MRDSS. See the Joint
        Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for the Joint Biological Agent Identification and
        Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) (JBAIDS Joint TTP), Version 2.2.0, for more
        information.

            5.2.4.5.1.1. The JBAIDS PT program is administered by AFIP. The structure of
            this PT program parallels the CAP program. All LBDTs are required to
            participate in this PT program IAW AFI 41-106. Results of the PT program are
            reviewed and certified by the DOD Center of Clinical Laboratory Medicine.
            LBDT chiefs are required to submit PT results to their respective MTF MRC.

            5.2.4.5.1.2. Competency testing is a key component to maintaining laboratory
            skills and ensuring accurate results. Each installation should develop a
            competency testing program that meets the recommendations set forth in the
            JBAIDS Quality Assurance Plan (QAP) version 1.2. Competency testing should
            be incorporated into each MTF’s monthly RSV training and documented in each
            operator’s training record.

        5.2.4.5.2. Personnel assigned to the LBDT, and at installations with an M1M, will be
        competently taught the appropriate handling of clinical and environmental samples
        that may be tested using the M1M. M1M training is conducted by the Army Medical
        Dept Center & School (AMEDDC&S) at Fort Sam Houston, TX. M1M training may
        also be conducted on-site via train the trainer. All trained operators must provide a
        copy of their training certificates to their respective MTF medical readiness section.
        M1M training should be documented in each person’s respective training record and
        MRDSS. For more information on M1M training, contact AMEDDC&S at DSN
        471-7702.

            5.2.4.5.2.1. The M1M PT program is administered by the Armed Forces Institute
            of Pathology (AFIP). The structure of this PT program parallels the CAP
            program. All LBDTs are required to participate in this PT program IAW AFI 41-
            106. Results of the PT program are reviewed and certified by the DOD Center of
            Clinical Laboratory Medicine. LBDT chiefs are required to submit results of the
            PT to their respective MTF MRC.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                  49



               5.2.4.5.2.2. Competency testing is a key component in maintaining laboratory
               skills and ensuring accurate results. Each installation with MIM assets should
               develop an M1M competency testing program that evaluates each trained operator
               at least every other month. Competency testing should be incorporated into each
               MTF’s monthly RSV training and documented in each operator’s training record.

   5.2.5. Nursing Services (886D), Field Response (886J), Triage (886K), Clinical (886L),
   and Manpower/Security (886M) Teams. MCRP team training is driven by local
   installation requirements. Training requirements should be tailored to meet identified
   vulnerabilities, threats, and planned response. Training should encompass management of
   casualties (including CBRN casualties) in the medical unit, awareness of the types of
   disasters the medical unit might expect, and protection and decontamination of medical
   personnel, patients, and medical facilities during CBRN conditions.


       5.2.5.2. Some positions may require professional medical training such as Advanced
       Trauma Life Support (ATLS), Advanced Burn Life Support (ABLS), Trauma Nursing
       Core Course (TNCC), and Basic Life Support (BLS) as prerequisites for the positions.

       5.2.5.3. Team chiefs should ensure all team members who are required to wear a
       respirator enroll in the RPP managed by BE. Before wearing respirators, team members
       must complete a medical questionnaire, receive medical approval, and complete fit-
       testing for tight-fitting respirators. AS 886K and M provide loose-fitting (hooded) PAPR
       respirators for the triage and manpower/security teams; and AS 886L provides N95 air
       filtering masks for the clinical teams .

       5.2.5.4. Recurring training should be accomplished as part of routine readiness training
       and exercises. This on-going training may be used to meet recurring annual first receiver
       awareness and operations level training requirements (when applicable) and must be
       documented.

5.3. Training Categories. The full spectrum of requisite CBRN training encompasses a
combination of core skill requirements and mission-specific or UTC-specific requirements. The
education and training phases for Air Force medical personnel begin with the initial training
received upon entry into the service and continue with periodic refresher training throughout the
member’s service. Figure 5.1 depicts the three phases of training: initial training, sustainment
training, and just-in-time (JIT) training.

                                   Figure 5.1. Training Phases




     5.3.1. Sustainment Training. Sustainment training is required at a specified frequency to
     maintain or enhance the proficiency of individual readiness, clinical, and unit/platform skills.
     The level of proficiency needed to maintain currency in CBRN-related skills and the
     criticality of the skill determines the frequency of training. Sustainment training focuses on
     Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC)-specific and UTC-specific requirements.

     5.3.2. Job Function and Unit-Specific Training. Several venues for AFSC-specific and
     UTC-specific training requirements are available to medical personnel. Formal courses as
     well as distance-learning courses provide an opportunity for a standardized approach to
     training. Maximum utilization of distance learning capabilities can play an integral role in
     reducing temporary duty (TDY) costs and time away from the installation. Reference
     materials are incorporated as needed to augment initial and sustainment training.

     5.3.3. Just-in-Time Training. Although JIT training is a component of education and
     training, it is not the optimal or desired method of training. It may not be of value for MC-
     CBRN response as there is no spin-up time when an event takes place. However, there may
     be circumstances when it is applicable and can provide immediate reinforcement of critical
     skills (e.g., how to wear respirators, proper inspection of PPE, and use of auto-injectors).

5.4. Professional Training Requirements. The following courses may be required for
professional training:

     •   ABLS–Advanced Burn Life Support
     •   ACLS–Advanced Cardiac Life Support
     •   ATLS–Advanced Trauma Life Support
     •   BLS–Basic Life Support
     •   FMCBC–Field Management of Chemical and Biological Casualties
     •   MMCBC–Medical Management of Chemical and Biological Casualties
     •   MEIR–Medical Effects of Ionizing Radiation
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                   51


   •   NETOPS–Nuclear Emergency Team Operations
   •   PHTLS–Pre-Hospital Trauma Life Support
   •   TNCC–Trauma Nursing Core Course

5.5. Field Exercises. Field exercises are training conducted outside the classroom, normally
employing MC-CBRN AS equipment and supplies under simulated CBRN conditions. Exercises
should simulate and help determine and document proficiency for all aspects of the response
phase of a CBRN operation. Essential elements of the exercise include C2, threat assessments,
CBRN identification, HRAs, laboratory analysis, triage, decontamination, treatment,
transportation of casualties, and targeted recovery operations.

   5.5.1. CBRN Exercise Requirements. It is critical for medical units to conduct or
   participate in CBRN exercises to ensure all elements of the medical unit’s CBRN response
   capabilities are well integrated and functional. Medical unit commanders should take
   advantage of every opportunity to participate in installation-wide CBRN exercises. AFI 41-
   106 and AFI 90-201summarizes requirements. MCRP team chiefs should provide team-
   specific MC-CBRN inputs and scenarios to the medical EET chief to ensure that MC-CBRN
   scenarios are added to the master events sequence listing for these exercises.

       5.5.1.1. CBRN exercises must include testing and evaluation of all MCRP teams and
       their responsibilities. Scenarios designed to evaluate medical CBRN response must
       include wearing of PPE for those teams assigned protective suit ensembles. (For AFRC,
       teams should exercise with AS 886H training PPE).

       5.5.1.2. Response to a CBRN event requires many of the same response actions as other
       types of incidents; however, responders must also establish and maintain a chain of
       custody for evidence preservation as directed by the IC. Additionally, responders must
       be alert for physical indicators and other outward warning signs of additional CBRN
       incidents and the potential for secondary attack.

       5.5.1.3. Exercise scenarios must include all areas of the medical unit that are involved in
       a CBRN incident and include sampling, risk assessment, and risk communication tasks.
       Scenarios should incorporate the tasks, roles, and responsibilities of the various MCRP
       teams that are responsible for MC-CBRN AS, as described in Chapter 1 of this AFTTP.
       For example, an all-hazards scenario involving a credible BW agent should test
       laboratory capabilities and interactions with local, state, and federal agencies.

   5.5.2. Patient Decontamination (886A) Exercises. Hands-on realistic training is essential
   for patient decontamination team proficiency. Ongoing training should be accomplished as
   part of routine readiness training/exercises. Joint training (recommend quarterly) with the
   triage and manpower/security decontamination support teams is conducted to ensure
   integration of activation procedures and response actions. Ongoing training must be used to
   satisfy annual HAZWOPER training requirements and team member competencies must be
   documented. Training topics at joint training/exercises include triage of contaminated
   casualties, wound and airway management during decontamination, and nerve agent
   symptoms and antidotes.
52                                                         AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013



        5.5.2.1. The patient decontamination team chief should capture problems and lessons
        learned during the exercises and report findings and planned courses of action to the MR
        office and ultimately to the pilot unit through the MC-CBRN MRA, HQ ACC/SG.

        5.5.2.2. The patient decontamination team chief should make every effort to work with
        the installation EET members to incorporate the patient decontamination team into
        installation-wide exercises. The use of moulage casualties and scenarios involving
        CBRN or industrial chemical incidents are highly encouraged during these exercises.
        EET members must be well versed in procedures involving medical response to CBRN
        incidents. If not, they should attend Air Force or DOD courses in these topics to bolster
        their knowledge and the value of their evaluation, and they should use the Exercise
        Evaluation Guides (EEGs).

     5.5.3. Pharmacy Team (886E) Exercises. The pharmacy team must participate fully in
     medical unit exercises IAW AFI 41-106. The pharmacy team must conduct at least one drill
     annually to test procedures for dispensing and inventory tracking of AS 886E and
     augmentation with on-hand CBRN applicable POS pharmaceuticals.

        5.5.3.1. The pharmacy team chief should capture issues for actions identified during
        exercises and drills and report findings and planned courses of action to the MRC.

        5.5.3.2. The pharmacy team should develop an expedient orientation and education
        package for augmentation personnel.

     5.5.4. Bioenvironmental Engineering Team (886H) Exercises. BEE team personnel must
     fully participate in medical unit and installation exercises. BEE team personnel should focus
     on the transport and deployment of AS 886H, test procedures for proper equipment and
     instrument utilization, re-supply issues, and inventory tracking of all AS items.

        5.5.4.1. The BEE team chief should coordinate with the installation EET chief to ensure
        maximum participation of the BEE team is incorporated into each exercise.

        5.5.4.2. Table top exercises (TTXs) may be considered in lieu of field exercises where
        severe weather is a factor during winter months and outside exercises may not be
        feasible. TTXs are excellent training tools for new response team members and allow
        discussion of practical on-scene problems before actual application.

        5.5.4.3. The BEE team chief should capture issues for action identified during exercises
        and drills and report findings and planned courses of action to the MR office.

        5.5.4.4. BEE team personnel must participate in the proficiency analytical testing (PAT)
        and other similar tools that may be developed.

     5.5.5. LBDT (886I) Exercises. LBDT personnel must fully participate in medical unit and
     installation exercises.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                              53



     5.5.5.1. The LBDT chief should coordinate with the installation EET chief to ensure
     maximum participation of the LBDT is incorporated into each exercise.

     5.5.5.2. LBDT personnel should focus on activation of AS 886I, test procedures,
     instrument use, re-supply issues, and inventory tracking of all AS items.

     5.5.5.3. The LBDT chief should capture issues for action identified during exercises and
     drills and report findings and planned courses of action to the MR office.

     5.5.5.4. LBDT personnel must participate in proficiency testing programs for JBAIDS
     and M1M if applicable.

  5.5.6. Nursing Services (886D), Field Response (886J), Triage (886K), Clinical (886L),
  Manpower/Security (886M), and Public Health (886P) Teams. These teams have no
  specialized exercise requirements beyond the requirements outlined in paragraph 5.5.1.

                                             Chapter 6

                         COMMUNICATIONS AND INTELLIGENCE

6.1. Communications Flow. Timely and accurate information must flow between the MCRP
teams in the field and the IC. The IC is responsible for relaying this information to the EOC
director. The EOC director is responsible for communicating the MCRP team’s needs to the
ESF #8 and ESF #11 representatives, who then relay this information to the MCC to ensure that
the CBRN event Incident Action Plan (IAP) objectives are met. Incident communication may
include information and requests necessary to prepare for incoming patients, provide patient and
equipment status reports, request additional resources (e.g., personnel, supplies, equipment), and
request mutual aid support from community emergency response resources. Communications
plans should be detailed in the MCRP.

6.2. Communication Systems and Methods. The MCC must be kept informed of the location
and actions of all teams. At least two methods of communicating with the MCC must exist.
Communications systems should be redundant and have the ability to communicate across all
response agencies. Communications discipline must be practiced and maintained. Field
treatment and initial response teams should use on-scene direct communications with the IC as
their primary communication method. All other MCRP teams should use various other methods
(e.g., radios, phones, email, runners), as appropriate, to communicate with other teams that
operate in and just outside the medical unit.

     6.2.1. Outside Communications. Support from other installation agencies, community
     partners, and other response personnel and organizations must be requested through the EOC.
     However, the MCC should be the focal point for all communications within the medical
     group. All communications should be documented in an events log (paper or electronic) that
     is maintained by the MCC.

     6.2.2. Laboratory Information Systems. The LBDT is equipped with laptop computers
     that are loaded with the appropriate JBAIDS and M1M software. Acquisition of additional
     communication and computer equipment is not specifically required to support the activation
     of the LBDT. The team will use existing information systems to capture pertinent data and
     detail incident logs and other requisite information to support up- and cross-channel reporting
     IAW Air Force and MAJCOM directives. The LBDT requires inter-team communication
     and two-way communication with other medical and non-medical functions. Laboratory
     directors must keep their medical chain of command informed of sample status and test
     results. They must also communicate with appropriate local and regional public health
     laboratories as well as other military laboratories for referral testing.

     6.2.3. Communications Security. Due to the sensitive nature of suspicious CBRN sample
     results collected by the BEE team, COMSEC and OPSEC field communication requirements,
     (i.e., iridium phone with secure communications) must be considered and discussed within
     initial response plans. The BEE team must have access to secured communication
     capabilities (STE and SIPRNET), and team members must hold a secret clearance or higher
     to ensure access to appropriate intelligence.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                     55



6.3. Intelligence Support. Timely, accurate intelligence support is critical to MC-CBRN
readiness. The PHO (or experienced PH non-commissioned officer [NCO]) maintains a working
relationship with other installation intelligence personnel. Information regarding CBRN threats
must be communicated among MCC and MCRP team chiefs to ensure readiness for response
operations. The BE and PHO team chiefs should be members of the installation’s threat working
group (TWG) and/or force protection working group.

6.4. Response to Intelligence. Intelligence about CBRN threats and incidents may originate
from a variety of military sources, civilian sources, and threat and vulnerability assessments.
Military intelligence sources include the intelligence officer (IN), security forces squadron
(SFS), AFOSI, and CE Readiness and Emergency Management flight). All pertinent
information should be forwarded immediately to the installation intelligence office, which is
responsible for reporting the information by secure means to the MAJCOM.

   6.4.1. MCRP Team Chiefs. MCRP team chiefs review threat and vulnerability assessments
   and are responsible for the following activities:

       6.4.1.1. Be fully cognizant of current and potential threats to supported installations due
       to military or commercial HAZMAT operations. This information is available from the
       BE in the form of an unclassified summary of the TIC/TIM vulnerability assessment.
       Results of medical unit and supported installation vulnerability assessments should be
       reviewed to identify critical failure nodes within the healthcare system.

       6.4.1.2. Through the MRO, and in conjunction with the PHO, BEE, and PHEO,
       determine readiness based on credible threats; anticipated numbers of casualties requiring
       triage, decontamination, treatment, and transport; and potential populations at risk.
       Determine requirements for mass prophylaxis, other preventive measures, and/or
       response efforts in the event of a CBRN event.

   6.4.2. MC-CBRN Assets. If intelligence indicates a high probability of an attack involving
   CBRN, the MCRP teams with MC-CBRN AS assets must ensure team members, equipment,
   and assigned PPE are pre-staged or prepared for immediate use. For inpatient facilities,
   during high probability situations, the stock of AS 886D supplies must be readied for use.

                                            Chapter 7

                               PATIENT DECONTAMINATION

7.1. Introduction. During a CBRN event, each medical unit must ensure patients are
decontaminated before entering the medical unit. Each medical unit must maintain an in-place
patient decontamination capability organically, through MAAs, MOAs, or MOUs with other
organizations (e.g., fire department), or a combination of both. At the beginning of an emerging
incident, CBRN contamination screening of patients/casualties should be initiated to protect the
medical capabilities of the medical facility and its staff. The medical unit may use the patient
decontamination area or a fixed facility engineered decontamination capability. This chapter
outlines the procedures for the patient decontamination team. It describes the initial patient
decontamination team’s response at a fixed medical unit following an incident involving CBRN
agents whether it is as a result of intentional acts, natural disasters, or peacetime accidents such
as an industrial chemical spill. (See Chapter 16 for ANG patient decontamination capabilities.)
(Not applicable to AFRC medical units.)

     7.1.1. Patient Decontamination Team Overview. As referenced in HQ USAF/IL message
     [DTG R262038Z Apr 99], Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Threat Response for US Air
     Force Installations, CBRN victims are normally decontaminated on-scene by the fire
     department, but “medical facilities will designate patient decontamination areas and plan for
     the decontamination and treatment of CBRN casualties.” This team provides
     decontamination capabilities at the medical unit for CBRN victims who self-present or are
     transported to the medical unit for definitive medical care and may have by-passed
     decontamination at the scene.

        7.1.1.1. The team must be ready to respond and function whenever the medical unit is
        open for emergency care of patients. At all other times (e.g., if the facility closes at
        nighttime), contaminated patients may have to be transported directly from the field
        decontamination site to other military or civilian facilities for further decontamination
        and medical treatment.

        7.1.1.2. The team provides the capability to remove or neutralize agents on casualties of
        an incident involving CBRN. The overall goals of the team are to (1) protect the medical
        treatment personnel and facility, (2) save lives, and (3) protect the environment.

        7.1.1.3. With the exception of ANG patient decontamination teams, Air Force patient
        decontamination teams are a non-deployable, organic medical asset. This capability
        should not be confused with UTC FFGLB, Patient Decontamination Team, UTC FFGLC,
        Patient Decontamination Equipment, or installation HAZMAT decontamination teams.
        Note: ANG team assets may be tasked by the state for off-installation response during
        state declared emergencies.

        7.1.1.4. The team is intended to fulfill the requirement for medical units to effectively
        respond to a CBRN incident, including those resulting from TIC/TIMS, with tailored,
        fast, light medical decontamination capabilities.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                     57



   7.1.2. Assumptions. The patient decontamination team is equipped and staffed to
   decontaminate victims who self-present after fleeing the scene of an incident or patients who
   require further cleaning after gross decontamination by the fire department before they enter
   the medical unit. The team is specifically designed for decontaminating patients at the
   medical unit. Personnel at the incident site are expected to process through the fire
   department’s decontamination process at the scene. The team operates on the assumption
   that gross contamination will be left behind at the scene and only minimal contamination will
   arrive at the medical unit.

       7.1.2.1. To continue medical operations following CBRN incidents, it is imperative to
       decontaminate individuals before they enter the medical unit. If the medical unit
       becomes grossly contaminated, alternate medical facility plans may become necessary,
       causing serious logistical problems, delays, and possible loss of life.

       7.1.2.2. Typically, when a contamination incident occurs, victim exposures range from
       severe to mild (possibly only psychosomatic). Victims with high exposures may collapse
       at the incident scene, while victims with mild exposures may depart the scene and seek
       medical attention immediately or later in the course of events.

7.2. Capabilities and Limitations. AS 886A provides enough PPE to support 24 personnel. A
minimum of 12 trained medical personnel are needed to run a patient decontamination facility at
any one time. Medical unit commanders must designate a large enough pool of personnel to
ensure at least 12 trained team members are available to set up, man, and process casualties
whenever the need arises, and to help manage heat stress through rotation. Patient
decontamination operations are exhausting and PPE can cause heat-related injuries. Alternating
shifts of personnel are required to avoid early team exhaustion and decreased performance. See
attachment 4 for additional guidance on work-rest cycle rotations.

   7.2.1. Decontamination Capability. A fully manned (12 personnel), well-trained team can
   decontaminate 6-10 litter patients and 10-15 ambulatory patients per hour for a typical
   scenario, depending on environmental conditions. The time to decontaminate will vary
   depending on the type of contaminant and methods required to accomplish decontamination.

   7.2.2. Allowance Standard. AS 886A provides stand-alone capability to decontaminate a
   maximum of 100 people (based on supplies). This capability will be sufficient for the first
   few hours of operations. After that time, the team should plan to use organic assets (towels,
   gowns, gloves, etc.) for further operations. The patient decontamination system consists of a
   tent, floor, and runoff-containment system and additional decontamination materials. When
   deployed with a well-trained, fully manned team, the patient decontamination system can be
   mission capable within 15 minutes of assembling. This includes having the decon shelter up
   (flooring, roller system and curtains); having the primary run-off control in place, i.e. the tent
   berm; having the water heater hooked up and providing warm water through the shower
   heads; and having at least four personnel in full PPE prepared to handle arriving patients.
   They can be fully operational within 20 minutes of assembly, to include set-up of waste
58                                                           AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

     water bladder, 12 personnel in full PPE, etc. (Note: Decontamination can be started before
     the tent and equipment are fully erected.)

     7.2.3. Large-Scale Incidents. Authorization levels or in-stock quantities for AS 886A may
     be insufficient to sustain immediate response (defined as the first 24-hours) for some types of
     CBRN incidents. When there are insufficient equipment and supply stock quantities on hand
     for an adequate response, the team chief should inform the medical unit commander and
     make recommendations for the procurement of additional equipment and supplies required to
     sustain operations during such incidents. In instances where large numbers of patients self-
     present to the medical unit and overwhelm the team’s capabilities for technical
     decontamination, the best strategy may be to conduct mass or gross decontamination to
     include clothing removal and self-decontamination (e.g., using skin decontamination kits,
     water hoses). If possible, also consider the option of converting the tent into a 4-line shelter
     to accommodate more ambulatory patients.

     7.2.4. Decontamination Limitations. CBRN agents may not be completely removed or
     neutralized during the decontamination process. Many CBRN agents, once inhaled or
     ingested, cannot be neutralized internally without comprehensive medical intervention, if at
     all. Some equipment items will not be salvageable after CBRN contaminant exposure. Items
     absorbent in nature (i.e., cloth, canvas, wood, some paints and even some silicone-based
     items) cannot always be decontaminated and will have to be disposed of once contaminated.
     The team chief must weigh the value of contaminated items and the cost in time and effort
     before attempting to decontaminate. Medical logistics facility management personnel must
     coordinate disposal of potentially contaminated materials through the BE and Installation
     Management Flights IAW AFI 41-201, Managing Clinical Engineering Programs, and AFI
     32-7042, Waste Management.

     7.2.5. Waste Disposal. A plan of action for proper treatment and disposal of
     decontamination wastewater and other potentially contaminated materials must be developed
     and included in the MCRP.

     7.2.6. PPE. Patient decontamination team members wear Level C PPE, comprised of a
     Disposable Toxicological Agent Protective System (DTAPS) and 3M PAPR with butyl
     rubber hood. AS 886A includes a training suit (white) that should be used for training and
     exercises so the DTAPS (green) can be saved for real-world responses. The PAPR generates
     noise within the protective hood, making all voice communications challenging. Level C
     PPE is adequate for personnel performing decontamination at the medical unit away from
     contamination at the incident scene. As with all CBRN PPE, the potential for heat injury is a
     serious limiting factor for team members. The team chief must encourage the consumption
     of fluids and rotate members before they succumb to the effects of heat stress. Before team
     members don PPE, the team chief should also conduct medical screening, to assess
     individual health status to determine any medical conditions of individuals who may be ill or
     injured, getting over an illness, or on any medications that may impact their ability to
     perform in Level C. See attachment 4 for additional guidance on performing medical
     assessments. Team members leaving the area for a break or rotation must properly
     decontaminate themselves and each other before exiting and doffing their PPE. See
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                    59

   attachment 4 for proper self decontamination and doffing of PPE. Once the contingency
   response has concluded, consult with Bioenvironmental Engineering to determine if the suit
   and hood can be decontaminated and reused or to determine proper disposal. All opened
   filters must be disposed of properly. The HAZMAT boots can be decontaminated by soaking
   in a 5% bleach solution for 24 hours. The 3M hood and PAPR must be inspected every 30
   days, to include a PAPR flow check, hood integrity check, etc., with documentation on AF
   Form 1071, Inspection/Maintenance Record.

7.3. Concept of Operations. The patient decontamination teams’ primary mission is to remove
surface CBRN and industrial contamination from patients at the medical unit to protect the staff
and the medical unit, as well as the patient. This process should be viewed as a qualitative
process rather than a quantitative one (i.e., every trace of CBRN contaminants may not be
removed in this process). The objective is to remove and/or neutralize the bulk of contaminants,
thus reducing further agent exposure for the contaminated patient, attending medical personnel,
and other medical assets. It is not necessary to quantitatively verify the effectiveness of the team
during CBRN incidents and exercises. Monitoring patients after they have been decontaminated
to determine if they have been quantitatively decontaminated sufficiently enough, if done
correctly, will unnecessarily delay patient treatment and contribute to shock, hypothermia, bleed-
out, etc. Proper decontamination procedures to include clothing removal, which removes 75-90
percent of contaminants, should minimize risks sufficiently enough that delaying patient care
through monitoring is an unnecessary risk.

   7.3.1. Hospital Decontamination Zone. The team decontaminates victims at the medical
   unit in an area unaffected by the initial contamination release. This area is referred to as the
   hospital decontamination zone. The hospital decontamination zone includes any area where
   the type and quantity of hazardous substances are unknown and where contaminated victims,
   contaminated equipment, or contaminated waste may be present. It is reasonably anticipated
   that employees in this zone might have exposure to contaminated victims, their belongings,
   equipment, or waste. This zone includes, but is not limited to, places where initial triage
   and/or medical stabilization of possibly contaminated victims occur, pre-decontamination
   waiting (staging) areas for victims, the actual decontamination area, and the post-
   decontamination victim inspection area. This area typically ends at the emergency entrance
   to the facility. In other documents, this zone is sometimes called the warm zone,
   contamination reduction zone, yellow zone, or limited access zone.

   7.3.2. Activation. The team will activate whenever there is a suspected or confirmed CBRN
   event to provide adequate setup time, which is critical to timely patient processing. The team
   serves as the gatekeeper of the medical unit when contaminated patients present. The team is
   part of a three-way activation in which the patient decontamination, triage, and
   manpower/security teams (to include the manpower/security decon support team) are all
   activated simultaneously. FRT, ambulance services, emergency department, and MCC
   protocols and checklists should be updated to reflect this policy.

       7.3.2.1. Upon activation, the team dons PPE within the MTF, and the equipment is
       removed from its storage location and assembled as outlined in Attachment 3. The
       primary triage team and manpower/security teams perform triage and crowd/traffic
60                                                          AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

        control, respectively, during initial setup and throughout decontamination operations.
        Note: PAPRs should be pre-assembled and stored in a ready-to-go mode. Flow checks
        should be conducted monthly to ensure PAPR is operational, and batteries should always
        be kept charged.

        7.3.2.2. When the team is activated, weather conditions must be assessed and
        consideration for an alternate location due to conditions may be required. This
        assessment should be reported to the MCC, as well as a request for additional personnel,
        if needed.

     7.3.3. Medical Unit Security. The patient decontamination system must be enclosed by a
     medical unit security perimeter to prevent the possibility of bystander exposure to off-gassing
     or residual CBRN agents. A request can be made for SF support to assist with area security
     and crowd and vehicle control. However, in the event of a CBRN terrorist event on the
     installation, SF personnel will likely be engaged elsewhere. During a CBRN incident, access
     to the medical unit must be controlled. Entry doors must be immediately secured to ensure
     no one enters the medical unit without undergoing an assessment to determine if they need
     decontamination. Medical units must develop local plans to secure entryways and, if
     necessary, post guards as soon as a CBRN incident is suspected. The manpower/security
     team should post signs at all entrances directing patients to the sole medical unit entrance
     where the patient decontamination equipment is set up.

     7.3.4. Decontamination Methods. The primary decontamination methods involve clothing
     removal and skin washing using soap and water. Reactive skin decontamination lotion
     (RSDL) is approved by FDA and can be used for neutralization of CW agents or for self
     decontamination while awaiting more technical decontamination. However, RSDL is not
     currently approved for whole body decontamination and is not recommended for
     decontaminating wounds because it may prevent wounds from healing properly. See
     Attachment 4 for specific procedures.

        7.3.4.1. The team will remove all clothing and personal effects from victims, including
        all identifying information, during the decontamination process. The team should place
        all of these items into individually labeled plastic bags for processing later. This
        processing may include decontamination and retrieval of valuables and the possible
        assessment by law enforcement agencies for evidence if a criminal act has occurred.
        Depending on the nature of the incident, this procedure may be performed by outside
        agencies that arrive later and provide follow-on assistance.

        7.3.4.2. The triage team (primary and secondary triage teams) sort patients based on
        medical needs and provide emergency stabilization of wounded and ill victims. The
        primary triage team triages victims, provides wound/airway management, determines
        which victims require decontamination, and administers nerve agent antidotes (if
        appropriate) before victims enter the patient decontamination system for
        decontamination. Depending on signs and symptoms, patients arriving from the field
        who have been grossly decontaminated should either be directed to the patient
        decontamination area or routed directly to the facility. The secondary triage team re-
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 61

     triages victims after they process through the patient decontamination system. Young
     children may need to receive higher priority for triage and decontamination because their
     conditions may deteriorate faster than adults.

  7.3.5. Cold Weather Decontamination. Concerns have been raised about how to conduct
  patient decontamination at locations subject to extreme cold temperatures (e.g., Alaska,
  Korea, northern tier bases, and other locations that may encounter challenges with patient
  decontamination during the colder winter months). While toxic industrial chemicals (TICs)
  become less volatile the colder it gets, there is still a risk to patients, responders, and the
  medical facility, especially if the chemical contaminant is tracked indoors where warmer
  temperatures can re-volatilize the contaminant. Some CW agents are specifically designed to
  be effective and lethal at extremely cold temperatures. Regardless of outdoor temperatures,
  it is still critical to decontaminate patients as soon as possible to minimize risks and
  contamination of medical facilities. The first important step in patient decontamination is the
  removal of all clothing before patients are transported and before they enter any facility for
  showering, especially if clothing is contaminated with chemicals. The shedding of
  contaminated clothing removes from 75-90 percent of the contaminant. Ideally, the next step
  is to decontaminate patients with copious amounts of water and soap. At temperatures less
  than 64 degrees Fahrenheit, there are risks of cold shock (leading to cardiac arrest),
  hypothermia, and patient refusal due to discomfort. At temperatures less than 35 degrees
  Fahrenheit, these risks become greater. In addition, there are strong likelihoods of equipment
  failure due to freezing water (e.g., in the sprayers) and creation of safety hazards from
  slippery surfaces due to ice formation. The key to dealing effectively with cold weather
  patient decontamination is to develop a cold weather decontamination plan based on local
  assets and conditions, incorporate those plans into the local MCRP and the Installation
  Emergency Management Plan, and exercise the plan.

     7.3.5.1. The following procedures are recommended at temperatures between 36-64
     degrees Fahrenheit:

         7.3.5.1.1. Ensure the water heater is working effectively to warm the water used for
         decontamination. Maintain the water temperature at 85-90 degrees Fahrenheit.

         7.3.5.1.2. Use heated blowers to warm up the patient decontamination tent. This
         equipment is available from flightline maintenance and CE shops. Coordinate
         requests through the Emergency Operations Center.

         7.3.5.1.3. Ensure patients are promptly wrapped and taken into a heated facility, such
         as the medical facility. Consider increasing the number of blankets on hand or
         acquire heated blankets such as those used for patient airlift.

         7.3.5.1.4. Establish a wind block between the decontamination tent and the medical
         facility using tarps, blankets, etc. At a minimum, the wind block should be at least 6
         feet tall to be effective and should be properly weighted down for safety reasons.
62                                                         AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

        7.3.5.2. The following procedures are recommended at temperatures less than 35 degrees
        Fahrenheit:

            7.3.5.2.1. Move the wet decontamination process indoors (e.g., an indoor pool
            facility, a gym with showers and/or heated pool, a heated garage or ambulance bay in
            the medical facility). Even if not heated, an ambulance bay should be about 10
            degrees warmer than outside temperatures and gets patients out of the elements.
            (Note: Patients should shed contaminated clothing before entering an indoor facility.)

            7.3.5.2.2. Use dry decontamination methods instead of wet decontamination
            methods. For example, after removing contaminated clothing, have patients use
            RSDL (currently on AS 886A), flour, paper towels, or other available materials.
            Follow up dry decontamination procedures whenever possible with a shower in a
            heated facility.

            7.3.5.2.3. When temperatures are too extreme to use water, the decon tent can be used
            as a heated shelter for patients to remove contaminated clothing and to perform dry
            decontamination methods before they enter a heated facility. Also consider
            increasing the number of blankets on hand.

            7.3.5.2.4. Prioritize patients exhibiting symptoms and special populations such as the
            elderly and very young since they all have limited or impaired ability to maintain
            body temperatures.

        7.3.5.3. For additional information on decontamination in cold weather environments,
        see U.S. Army Solider and Biological Chemical Command (SBCCOM) publication,
        Guidelines for Cold Weather Mass Decontamination During a Terrorist Chemical Agent
        Incident, as well as the OSHA Best Practices for Hospital-Based First Receivers of
        Victims from Mass Casualty Incidents Involving the Release of Hazardous Substances.

     7.3.6. Counter-Radiological Warfare Considerations. Existing patient decontamination
     procedures are valid for radiological incidents. Ensure that effluent containment
     requirements, as determined by the local CE environmental office, are included in local plans
     and checklists (i.e., Annex N). Also include radiological dose tracking procedures for first
     receivers as determined by the Installation Radiation Safety Officer (IRSO). Consider all
     open wounds contaminated until proven otherwise. The first priority is to treat life or limb
     threatening conditions using standard precautions before patient decontamination.
     Otherwise, remove clothing and perform decontamination with soap and water before
     treatment.

7.4. Manning. During an attack, FPCON Delta may be declared, and entry routes into the
installation may be shut off. Limited access and official Delta measures (e.g., vehicle
inspections) may delay medical personnel. Some contaminants (i.e., nerve, blood, or blister
agents) do most of their damage within the first few minutes of exposure, so time is of the
essence. Medical units cannot depend on anyone from off-installation to be recalled to staff the
patient decontamination team in time to provide any benefit to patients. Medics within the
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                    63

medical unit must be trained and capable of taking immediate action to save lives and limit
victims’ exposure to these contaminants. The available pool of trained decontamination team
members must be large enough to field a 12-person team, while accounting for leave, TDYs, and
some personnel present for duty who cannot be contacted for immediate response. This goal can
be accomplished by training a large number of medical unit personnel in patient
decontamination. A minimum of 24 is recommended. Some medical units have chosen to
accomplish this goal by training all medical unit personnel during medical unit in-processing
upon permanent change of station (PCS). (Note: FFGLB and FFGLC are intended as deployable
assets and are not considered to meet MC-CBRN patient decontamination requirements.)

   7.4.1. Team Chief Assignment. Commanders will choose the most suitable person to act as
   the team chief. The team chief is responsible for training, maintaining supplies and
   equipment, and coordinating realistic exercise scenarios. In the absence of the team chief,
   the most senior person present who has been trained in patient decontamination operations
   will assume this role, as it may not be practical to wait for a team chief (e.g., due to leave,
   TDY, geographically separated).

   7.4.2. FRT and BE Roles. FRT and BEE team members may be trained but not formally
   assigned to the patient decontamination team. These two teams have specific responsibilities
   at the CBRN incident scene and are unable to provide patient decontamination support at the
   medical unit.

7.5. Integration. Medical unit response planning must include integration and coordination with
other medical unit and installation decontamination capabilities, as well as follow-on capabilities
from local, state, tribal, and federal agencies.

   7.5.1. Horizontal Integration. Patient decontamination team planning should be coordinated
   with other medical unit/non-medical unit teams responsible for decontaminating self-
   presenters at the medical unit or victims at the incident site. All interactions with other
   response organizations or work centers within the organizations should be coordinated
   through the MCC. Medical unit teams supporting this function are described in the MCRP
   and include the following:

       7.5.1.1. Manpower/security teams that may be required to provide additional personnel
       to supplement patient decontamination team members.

       7.5.1.2. Primary triage teams that will be posted to triage casualties before being
       processed through patient decontamination and secondary triage teams that will receive
       casualties.

       7.5.1.3. Manpower/security team personnel who will be posted at medical facility
       entrances to provide entrance control.

       7.5.1.4. Decon support team personnel (a subset of the manpower/security team) who
       will provide crowd control and vehicle control support, establish single entry and exit
       points to the medical unit, and assist ambulatory and non-ambulatory patients.

         7.5.1.5. Medical unit security resources may also be required to secure AS 886A assets,
         provide crowd control, and control entry into the patient decontamination system.

     7.5.2. Vertical Integration. All communications and requests for assistance or information
     by or to higher echelon or supporting Air Force or DOD commands, as well as state, tribal, or
     federal follow-on resources must be coordinated through the EOC by the MCC. The patient
     decontamination team must not communicate directly with outside agencies without prior
     approval from the MCC.

     7.5.3. Additional Resources. The acquisition of additional services, equipment, and
     supplies in a CBRN event may be necessary when there is a depletion of AS 886A.
     Installation WRM caches (upon approval) and any additional personnel needed to support the
     patient decontamination mission should be acquired from the medical unit or through outside
     assistance (i.e., community EMS, National Disaster Medical System [NDMS], or healthcare
     facilities).

7.6. Equipment and Supplies. AS 886A is designed to provide the equipment and supplies for
the team to decontaminate litter and ambulatory patients. The patient decontamination system
consists of a tent, floor, shower system, runoff-containment system, and decontamination
supplies. (Note: The medical unit may use the patient decontamination shelter or a fixed-facility
engineered decontamination facility.) This AS includes the following sub- assemblages:

     •   Sub-assemblage PD–Patient Decon
     •   Sub-assemblage S1–Safety

     7.6.1. Water Supply. The patient decontamination package requires access to a fire hydrant
     and an electrical outlet (110v, 16 amp, ground fault circuit interrupter [GFCI] protected)
     located within 100 feet of the intended setup site. (Note: The intended setup site should be
     as close in proximity to the MTF as feasibly possible to shorten the distance that patients
     have to be transported after decontamination.) To connect the water system to a standard
     American hydrant, a 2.5–1.5 inch adapter and two 50-feet by 1.5-inch hoses are required.
     The water heater has a built-in check-valve to prevent backflow. However, some states
     require backflow prevention at the source (between the hydrant and the fire hoses).
     Installations that require backflow prevention devices may need to obtain or purchase one
     locally. Consult the base CES Operations Flight to determine if one is required.

         7.6.2.1. AFI 32-1066, Backflow Prevention Program, requires the method of connection
         to be coordinated with the installation’s cross-connection and backflow prevention
         program manager. (Contact BE or the CES Operations Flight for information.)

         7.6.2.2. The intended use of a designated fire hydrant as the water supply should be
         coordinated with the installation fire department.

         7.6.2.3. Patient decontamination team training should include instruction on how to flush
         and connect to a hydrant.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                               65



  7.6.2. Local Considerations. AS 886A is comprehensive, but every item may not be
  needed at every installation. As an example, installations with suitable shower facilities
  adjacent to the designated entrance may only require the heater, run-off containment system,
  and privacy curtains. For one to two contaminated personnel, it may be more appropriate to
  use available eye wash/safety shower facilities, emergency room showers, or similar facility
  rather than the patient decontamination package. The equipment list is not all-inclusive for
  overseas locations. Additional items such as special fire hydrant adaptors (one standard
  adapter is on the AS), backflow preventers, and appropriate electrical connectors may be
  needed. ANG bases, which may be tasked with off-installation response, should maintain
  sufficient GFCI connectors to protect all electrical equipment used by the team.

                                            Chapter 8

                                          PHARMACY

8.1. Introduction. This chapter assists medical unit planners in developing a pharmacy team to
respond to a CBRN incident, peacetime emergency response incident, or natural disaster and
provides guidance on the management and employment of AS 886E. This chapter applies to all
Air Force military and civilian personnel (including AFRC and ANG units and members that
have the capability).

     8.1.1. Pharmacy Team Overview. The pharmacy team must be able to respond and be
     functional at times when the medical unit is open for emergency care of patients and must
     integrate the CBRN pharmaceutical supplies from AS 886E into the capability of the FRT
     and clinical teams at the medical unit (AS 886J/K/L). This AS includes the following sub-
     assemblages:

        8.1.1.1. The immediate medical response and nursing services sub-assemblages are
        designed for a broad range of chemical and biological threats.

        8.1.1.2. The counter-radiation medications sub-assemblage provides pre-treatment with
        radioactive iodide, as well as treatment for severe radiation poisoning.

            8.1.1.2.1. Potassium iodide is a countermeasure for a radiological release from a
            nuclear power plant or radiological dispersal device where an isotope of iodine was
            used. Current DoD policy for military installations is to ensure their plans have been
            coordinated with local and state plans which in turn follow the guidelines established
            by FEMA in its “Federal Policy on the Use of KI”. Proximity to a nuclear power
            plant will be the driving factor in determining a medical unit’s need for potassium
            iodide. Both FEMA and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission recommend a 10-mile
            emergency planning zone (EPZ) around a nuclear power plant. Within this 10-mile
            EPZ they recommend PI as an additional step to augment evacuation and shelter-in-
            place recommendations. Consult with the installation Radiation Safety Officer
            (IRSO) and with local and state emergency planners to determine the need to
            maintain PI. The final determination will be made by the MRC and MDG
            commander.

            8.1.1.2.2. Ondansetron is a countermeasure for severe radiation exposure similar to
            the expected physiological effects caused by a nuclear detonation. Installations
            located near major metropolitan areas (such as Washington DC, Los Angeles, New
            York, Chicago) should consider carrying this countermeasure because these cities
            would be more likely to be targeted than smaller cities. AS quantities are based on up
            to 300 casualties. Local off-installation cancer centers may use ondansetron for
            treatment, and these centers can provide an excellent source for ondansetron rotation.
            The medical unit commander, IRSO, and pharmacy team chief will determine the
            level of capability needed. To preclude duplicate effort in response areas at
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                      67

           installations with nuclear assets, the pharmacy team should collaborate with local
           EOD personnel to determine stock levels for first responders.

       8.1.1.3. The first responder countermeasure medications sub-assemblage provides
       antibiotics for prophylaxis or treatment, chemical agent antidotes, or radiation blocking
       agents for first responder protection.

       8.1.1.4. The point of distribution sub-assemblage provides supplies and equipment for
       mass dispensing of prophylaxis.

   8.1.2. Assumptions. A CBRN incident involving significant live casualties will result in a
   surge in the requirement for material support, including pharmaceuticals. Pharmaceuticals
   include antibiotics for prophylaxis or treatment, chemical agent antidotes, or radiation
   blocking agents, as well as agents for supportive care. Medical unit response planning must
   include integration and coordination with follow-on response capabilities from local, state,
   and federal agencies. Planning is based on the following assumptions:

       8.1.2.1. POS will not be sufficient to respond to a CBRN event.

       8.1.2.2. After the first 24 hours, additional federal, state, and local assets have arrived at
       the location of the incident and are functional. These resources include the SNS or Push
       Packs, if activated. However, U.S. government or host nation resources may be delayed
       more than 24 hours.

       8.1.2.3. Inclusion of the installation housing population as part of the population served
       through SNS activation and/or mass prophylaxis must be coordinated by each installation
       with local community disaster response planners.

       8.1.2.4. The SNS will be activated, if needed, using local community health department
       procedures as outlined in the MCRP.

       8.1.2.5. Pharmaceuticals may be needed at the scene of an incident, at designated points
       of dispensing, at out-patient clinics, or at inpatient locations.

8.2. Capabilities and Limitations. AS 886E was established and funded to treat up to 300
CBRN casualties and 150 first responders following an event and to provide up to 5 days of
prophylaxis medication for casualties and 30 days of prophylaxis medication for first responders.
The 886E packages were developed with the expectation that 10 percent of casualties will be
pediatric. Pharmaceuticals on this AS were selected to mimic, with some exceptions, the
pharmaceuticals routinely stocked in medical units. This design allows for the rotation of these
additional drugs within the POS to minimize expirations.

   8.2.1. Responsibilities. The pharmacy team serves as the pharmaceutical logistics and
   supply center for all CBRN-related pharmaceuticals and is the single POC for acquisition of
   these supplies by all medical unit wards, clinics, points of dispensing, and installation
   medical responders.
68                                                           AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013



        8.2.1.1. During the initial phases of response operations, the pharmacy team chief should
        evaluate team capabilities within the context of overall health and medical services
        requirements. Execution of pharmacy team responsibilities depends on the specific type
        of event. If an overwhelming number of patients present, it is the medical unit
        commander’s decision as to whether additional on-hand medical pharmaceutical stocks
        may be employed.

        8.2.1.2. In the event of a CBRN incident, AS 886E pharmaceuticals will be exhausted
        first, then POS, and then WRM pharmaceuticals. In the event the incident exhausts the
        local military installation’s supplies, pharmaceuticals might also be available from the
        SNS.

     8.2.2. Dependencies. Due to the unknown nature of CBRN incidents and response required,
     the ability to provide a substantial response may be limited by the available manning. The
     manning requirements to support CBRN response may exceed the capabilities of the
     pharmacy team. In the event of a mass prophylaxis or dispensing requirement, the pharmacy
     team will depend heavily on augmentation from other manning sources to accomplish the
     mission.

8.3. Concept of Operations. The pharmacy team provides an enhanced CBRN response
capability by using the existing pharmacy MCRP team concept, structure, and personnel.
Pharmacy enhancements include the supplies provided by AS 886E, response guidance and
doctrine, and specialized training, including higher Air Force sponsored exercises. The
pharmacy team performs a number of activities in preparation for and in response to a CBRN
incident.

     8.3.1. Pre-Event Planning. The pharmacy team should develop plans and procedures for
     the acquisition, reception, control and distribution of pharmaceutical supplies. Plans should
     include development of MAAs, MOAs, or MOUs with local authorities to ensure they
     include the installation population in their numbers. Plans should identify pre-determined
     locations for dispensing of pharmaceuticals from the SNS.

        8.3.1.1. Activation and distribution of caches for protection and treatment of medical
        unit staff, other response personnel, CBRN victims and other eligible beneficiaries should
        be IAW the MCRP.

        8.3.1.2. The pharmacy team leader and PHEO should assist in the development of a mass
        prophylaxis and distribution plan. This planning involves coordination with off-
        installation hospitals and public health agencies because biological agent exposures can
        multiply across the installation boundaries.

        8.3.1.3. The pharmacy team should develop plans to expediently move the entire AS
        886E cache to a secondary location (i.e., alternate facility) in the event that its primary
        storage area is threatened.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                  69

  8.3.2. Strategic National Pharmaceutical Stockpile. The CDC has large caches of
  medicine and supplies available for public health emergencies if there is an event (e.g.,
  pandemic flu, terrorist attack, natural disaster) that overwhelms or depletes local supplies.
  The decision to deploy SNS assets may be based on evidence of an overt release of an agent
  that could adversely affect public health. It is more likely, however, that subtle indicators,
  such as unusual morbidity and/or mortality rates identified through the nation’s disease
  outbreak surveillance and epidemiology network, will alert health officials to the possibility
  (and confirmation) of a biological or chemical incident or a national emergency.

     8.3.2.1. To receive SNS assets, the affected state’s governor’s office will directly request
     the deployment of the SNS assets from the CDC or HHS. HHS, CDC, and other federal
     officials will evaluate the situation and determine a prompt course of action (COA). See
     AFI 10-2603 for more information.

     8.3.2.2. In the event that the SNS is activated and deployed, the installation commander
     will activate installation plans (IEMP 10-2, MCRP, DCP) and work closely with local
     health department officials to accept, allocate, transport, and guard SNS pharmaceuticals.
     Strict inventory tracking and accountability measures must be applied to SNS caches.

  8.3.3. Documentation and Reporting. U.S. government or host nation resources may be
  delayed more than 24 hours. To maximize preparedness, pharmacy personnel must do the
  following:

     8.3.3.1. Perform an initial inventory of AS 886E on receipt and develop an AS 886E
     inventory and maintenance plan. This plan should include procedures for routine
     periodic re-inventory, evaluation of expiration dates and shelf lives of pharmaceuticals,
     stock management (rotation), storage facilities with environmental control and security,
     and methods for replacement or service life extension of expiring supplies.

     8.3.3.2. Develop and maintain a detailed inventory of POS pharmaceuticals necessary for
     response to a CBRN incident.

     8.3.3.3. Identify and maintain awareness of any local inventory of WRM
     pharmaceuticals necessary for such a response.

     8.3.3.4. In conjunction with designated medical unit clinical specialists and the PHEO,
     assist in the development of patient information sheets that can be dispensed with
     medications.

  8.3.4. Pharmacy Activation. The pharmacy team will be activated immediately upon
  notification of a suspected CBRN incident, peacetime accident, or natural disaster by the
  medical unit command duty officer, MCC, or emergency department, as described in the
  MCRP.

     8.3.4.1. At least one member of the pharmacy team must be available for immediate
     recall at all times.
70                                                          AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013



        8.3.4.2. If a member of the pharmacy team is not available on-site at all times, an
        individual from the medical unit will be authorized to release supplies designated as
        having no-notice requirements, if these supplies have not been pre-positioned.

        8.3.4.3. If there is advance warning of a potential hostile act, possibly involving CBRN
        agents, the pharmacy team will be activated and will commence pre-incident operations
        IAW the MCRP. These actions may include the following:

            8.3.4.3.1. Establishing communications with the MCC and other designated work
            centers.

            8.3.4.3.2. Pre-positioning portions of AS 886E to designated distribution or
            dispensing sites or point of care locations.

            8.3.4.3.3. Determining snap-shot inventories of AS 886E, POS supplies, and any
            local WRM supplies.

            8.3.4.3.4. Determining immediate availability of supply transportation vehicles and
            drivers.

            8.3.4.3.5. Determining the immediate availability of additional pharmaceutical
            supplies through previously established MAAs, MOAs, and MOUs. Ensure
            procedures are in place for requesting additional supplies if needed.

        8.3.4.4. For CBRN incidents that occur without warning, the team should implement the
        same procedures as an incident with warning and do the following actions:

            8.3.4.4.1. Coordinate with the PHO through the MCC to determine the projected
            population requiring treatment and the population at risk (i.e., those requiring
            vaccination or prophylaxis).

            8.3.4.4.2. Compare projected pharmaceutical requirements with immediately
            available caches from all local sources and report projected surpluses or deficiencies
            to the MCC.

            8.3.4.4.3. Continue to liaison with the PHO to determine changes in projected need,
            and update the MCC following these re-evaluations.

            8.3.4.4.4. Be prepared to deliver pharmaceuticals to sites as directed by the MCC.

     8.3.5. Pharmacy Security. Because the likelihood of theft or vandalism of caches is
     considered high, AS 886E must be maintained under positive security procedures at all times.
     During routine operations, storage in controlled/no access locations with periodic inspection
     by designated medical unit personnel is sufficient. In the event of mass prophylaxis
     operations, heightened FPCON status (if applicable), or during actual response operations,
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                     71

   caches must be guarded by medical unit security personnel or SF at all times IAW the
   MCRP.

8.4. Manning. Pharmacy personnel include members from the pharmacy MCRP response team
as determined by the MCRP. The following positions must be filled by members of the
pharmacy team as an additional duty: property custodian, logistician, planner, and administrative
support. At least one team member must be a pharmacist. The pharmacist is normally the team
chief.

   8.4.1. Mass Prophylaxis and Dispensing. Teams identified in the installation’s mass
   prophylaxis plan will assist in conducting mass prophylaxis operations when the plan is
   activated. The mass prophylaxis and dispensing plan includes manning requirements and
   augmentation requirements and procedures. The mass prophylaxis point of distribution
   template in the contingency operation plan provides details on these requirements and
   procedures.

   8.4.2. Augmentation. Additional manning support should be requested through the MCC
   IAW the MCRP. Personnel augmentation sources may include personnel in medical holding,
   the American Red Cross, other tenant commands, or volunteers. Certain medical AFSCs
   (e.g., 47XX) may be requested to perform activities such as mass prophylactic
   inoculations/vaccinations and prescription writing, depending on their background and
   training.

       8.4.2.1. Augmentees must be oriented and trained appropriately.

       8.4.2.2. Consideration of the type and extent of CBRN incident must be taken into
       account before calling up augmentation from local ANG and AFRC personnel. Many
       ANG and AFRC pharmacy personnel work at local hospitals. Calling up these personnel
       to aid the medical unit could strain civilian pharmacy capabilities in responding to a local
       CBRN event.

8.5. Integration. Medical unit response planning must include integration and coordination
with other medical unit or installation initial medical response capabilities, as well as follow-on
response capabilities from local, state, and federal agencies.

   8.5.1. Horizontal Integration. Pharmacy planning should be coordinated with other
   medical unit/non-medical unit teams and off-installation responders responsible for incident
   response and delineated in the MCRP.

       8.5.1.1. Initial and first-responder teams assigned as first-on-scene to deliver life
       saving/life sustaining casualty care before transport to the medical unit or other location
       for more definitive care may need additional pharmaceutical support (e.g., IV fluids, pain
       medications) from AS 886E resources to accomplish their mission.

       8.5.1.2. Manpower/security teams are tasked to ensure adequate protective measures are
       planned for and implemented during CBRN emergencies. Manpower/security team
72                                                          AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

        personnel will be posted at medical/alternate facility entrances to provide entrance and
        crowd control. Some personnel will be assigned to the patient decontamination area for
        crowd and vehicle control efforts and to establish a single entry and exit point to the
        medical unit. Medical unit security resources may be required to secure AS 886E assets
        or provide crowd and entrance control at designated mass prophylaxis and distribution
        sites. If mass prophylaxis or dispensing sites are required, the pharmacy team should
        coordinate with the MCC for additional security support from installation security assets.

        8.5.1.3. The pharmacy team should coordinate with PH to provide collaborative
        expertise on CRBN response, assessment, and treatment/prevention.

     8.5.2. Vertical Integration. All communications and requests for assistance or information
     by or to higher echelon or supporting Air Force or DOD commands, as well as state or other
     non-DOD federal follow-on resources must be coordinated through the MCC IAW the
     MCRP. The pharmacy team must not communicate directly with outside agencies without
     prior approval from the MCC.

     8.5.3. Additional Resources. Outside assistance may be required in the event of a CBRN
     event that exceeds the capability of AS 886E, POS, installation WRM caches, or available
     personnel within the medical unit to accomplish the mission. The pharmacy team may
     integrate with local equivalent civilian response resources to provide a collaborative effort
     IAW with the MCRP. The medical unit commander or MCC commander must authorize this
     integration.

8.6. Equipment and Supplies. AS 886E quantities are estimated to treat up to 300 CBRN
casualties and 150 first responders following an event and provide up to 5 days of prophylaxis
medication for casualties and 30 days of prophylaxis medication for first responders. Antibiotic
quantities were established with the expected ratio of two-thirds of patients will receive therapy
with doxycycline and one-third will receive ciprofloxacin. Installations, after assessing the risk
and with MAJCOM approval, may increase the 300-person and 48-hour planning factors. AS
886 includes the following sections:

     8.6.1. 886E Sub-Assemblage PA. This section was developed for immediate response. All
     medical units must maintain 886E-PA in its entirety as part of the CBRN program or as
     normal POS.

     8.6.2. 886E Sub-Assemblage PB. This section is intended for medical units that have
     inpatient capabilities. Medical units with an inpatient capability must procure and maintain
     886E-PB.

     8.6.3. 886E Sub-Assemblage PC. This section contains counter-radiological drugs and is
     an optional package based on the potential hazard or threat. The decision to stock all or part
     of this subset is mostly based on the radiation risk assessment performed by BE.

     8.6.4. 886E Sub-Assemblage PD. This section contains the pharmaceutical radiation
     countermeasures necessary to treat 150 first responders.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                          73



  8.6.5. 886E Sub-Assemblage PE. This section contains supplies and equipment to support
  the unit’s distribution of mass prophylaxis.

                                            Chapter 9

                      BIOENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING (BEE)

9.1. Introduction. This chapter outlines the response procedures for the BEE team during a
CBRN incident. The BEE team provides technical support to the EOC and the IC. BEE team
actions are coordinated with the IC (or EOC if activated). The BEE team identifies, analyzes,
and recommends controls for OEH threats by performing HRAs. Demands for BEE capabilities
depend on the magnitude of the incident, type of scenario, availability of installation readiness
and EM assets, and the overall missions and capabilities of the medical unit/installation. BEE
team support and responsibilities anticipated during pre-event planning operations, immediate
emergency operations, sustained operations, and recovery operations are supported by AS 886H.

     9.1.1. BEE Team Overview. A CBRN incident will result in a surge in the requirement for
     BEE support at the scene of the event, supporting medical units, and other point of care
     locations. This increased support is needed both during and after the incident.

        9.1.1.1. Each BEE team must maintain, in ready status, the equipment and supplies
        required for initial response to a CBRN event, including PPE, specialized detection and
        analysis equipment, supplies, and reagents necessary for the detection and identification
        of CBRN agents. The team must also ensure ready access to response vehicles capable of
        transporting response material and personnel to an incident.

        9.1.1.2. BEE team planning must include integration and coordination through
        appropriate channels with other installation teams such as the LBDT, EM, as well as
        local, state, and federal response agencies, as appropriate.

        9.1.1.3. During CBRN response operations or heightened FPCON, the MCC maintains
        operational control over the BEE team IAW the MCRP. (For AFRC bases, operational
        control of the BEE team remains with the wing control center to which they are normally
        assigned.) The IC (normally the fire chief) has tactical control over the BEE team under
        AFIMS. The BEE team serves in a support role under the operations division.

        9.1.1.4. The BEE team may be required to perform sample collection and preservation at
        the scene. BEE personnel must conduct sampling in a manner that preserves crime scene
        evidence and must maintain positive control of samples. Personnel must document
        chain-of-custody from the time of collection to delivery for lab analysis. Installation SF
        or appropriate law enforcement personnel are responsible for determining whether the
        samples are required later for evidence. OEH sampling may be required to assess health
        risks for individuals potentially exposed to hazardous substances.

     9.1.2. Assumptions. BEE support will likely be required at the immediate scene of the
     incident, as well as at other designated points in support of the response effort. These
     locations will likely include the ECP and downwind locations. The BEE team will provide
     direct on-scene involvement and interface with the IC.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                   75

9.2. Capabilities and Limitations. Each BEE capability may support one or more AFMS
capabilities.

   9.2.1. SG-related Vulnerability Assessments. The BEE team is responsible for conducting
   SG-related vulnerability assessments. They coordinate with members of the Threat Working
   Group (TWG) to identify critical infrastructure and operational components of the
   installation/location. In conjunction with the TWG, the team uses existing sources of
   information, such as intelligence, previous vulnerability studies, and EPA reports to identify
   potential threats to critical nodes. The team assesses the overall vulnerability of critical
   nodes, considering threats, probability of occurrence, and consequence of effects. The team
   provides recommendations through the TWG to reduce overall vulnerability and risk to the
   mission.

   9.2.2. Predictive Exposure Assessments. The team conducts predictive exposure
   assessments using OEH data, intelligence products, and modeling information collected in
   garrison as a baseline for predicting potential OEH exposures across the range of military
   operations.

   9.2.3. OEH Threat Response. The team is responsible for effective and efficient response
   to deliberate and crisis incidents that may result in actual or potential exposure to OEH
   threats. The team documents information on actual and potential exposures from OEH
   incidents in the Defense Occupational and Environmental Health Readiness System
   (DOEHRS) as part of the Longitudinal Exposure Record (LER).

   9.2.4. OEH Hazard Identification. The team is responsible for effectively and efficiently
   anticipating, recognizing, and analyzing actual and potential CBRN and physical health
   threats. The team associates agent effects with the health risk to potentially exposed
   personnel, working with EM, EOD, and other installation personnel to identify OEH hazards
   associated with different CBRN effects. The team works through the TWG to identify
   probable risks and assist with planning phases for posturing efforts, incorporating potential
   health risks from the residual effects of weapons (OEH hazards versus direct blast effects)
   and other contingencies such as TIC/TIM releases. The team is responsible for collecting,
   preserving, packaging, shipping, transporting, and escorting samples associated with CBRN
   responses at garrison locations, except for biological samples that are shipped or transported
   by the LBDT and escorted by local OSI or FBI personnel.

   9.2.5. Exposure Investigations. The BEE team works with aerospace medicine to evaluate
   post-exposure outcomes through interviews, re-creations, modeling, post-exposure medical
   exams, controls implemented, and resulting health effects to document human health threats.
   The team uses these results to provide recommendations to commanders on ways to reduce
   risks in future operations and other similar and concurrent operations. The team will
   document known operational impacts (maximizing positive impacts and minimizing negative
   impacts).

   9.2.6. OEH Hazard Management. The BEE team is responsible for providing
   recommendations to eliminate or mitigate actual or potential CBRN and physical OEH
76                                                         AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

     threats. They recommend protective postures in counter-chemical, biological, radiological,
     and nuclear (C-CBRN) operations and assist with shelter management.

        9.2.6.1. The team uses information from gathered intelligence, vulnerability assessments,
        occupational and environmental health site assessments (OEHSAs), and incident-specific
        data to provide threat control recommendations to the commander with respect to real-
        time and future operations so the commander can make proper ORM decisions. The
        team applies the OEH hazard control hierarchy, using engineering, administrative, and
        PPE as the operations dictate.

        9.2.6.2. The team determines the adequacy of collective protection for controlling OEH
        threats, as requested. They perform HRAs to determine whether to release personnel
        from collectively protected facilities.

     9.2.7. Exposure Tracking. The team documents information regarding identification,
     evaluation, and control of actual and potential OEH hazards as part of the LER. They tie
     completed or potentially completed exposure pathways to individuals using spatial and
     temporal reference marks.

     9.2.8. Health Risk Management. As part of the health component of the ORM process, the
     BEE team communicates OEH risk-based information and advises decision makers on COAs
     to minimize OEH risks and maximize benefits for operations and missions. Health risk
     management recommendations and decisions are integrated into the commander’s ORM
     decision-making. The team is responsible for effectively communicating potential health
     effects, outcomes, and control measures and providing information consistent with the HRA.
     The team applies OEH exposure data to groups of similarly exposed individuals.

9.3. Concept of Operations. The BEE team will be activated immediately upon notification of
a suspected CBRN incident by the MCC, emergency room, command post, or the fire
department IAW the MCRP and IEMP 10-2. The team can respond off-installation only at the
direction of the installation commander, HHQ, the President, or IAW established MAAs, MOAs,
or MOUs. For all contingency responses, the BEE team should coordinate with the installation
EM flight to ensure proper integration of capabilities. Based on the scenario and intelligence, the
BEE team should initially posture for an all-hazards response until the contingency has been
characterized and the response can be appropriately tailored.

     9.3.1. Response to Biological Agents. BEE team members, when augmented by the LBDT,
     have limited capabilities to provide presumptive positive results for specific biological
     agents. Once all other potential hazards have been ruled out or are known, BEE team
     members responding to a suspicious biological agent threat should use Level C PPE at a
     minimum. They should bring the XMX biological aerosol sampler, hand-held assays
     (HHAs), scene documentation equipment, Quicksilver Kit, IATA certified shipping
     containers, chain-of-custody documents, and other items needed for legal shipping such as
     containers for decontamination liquids and biohazard labels. The team should coordinate
     with the lab to obtain IATA certified shipping containers and state approved chain-of-
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                77

  custody forms, as well as to determine the requirement for collecting and delivering a
  duplicate or split sample.

     9.3.1.1. Suspicious Powders. Additional recommended equipment to bring to the
     response site for suspicious powders include the HazMatID for biological protein
     identification and to determine presence/absence of TIC/TIMs, radiation detection
     equipment, and electronic personal dosimeters (EPDs).

     9.3.1.1.1. With proper intelligence, a negative HazMatID result for biological indicators
     and two negative HHAs normally suffice to rule out a biological agent. After one
     negative HHA result, the second HHA test should be conducted using a diluted sample
     (1:10) to ensure that a negative result isn’t due to either too much “junk” which can
     interfere with the assay, or too much BWA being collected with the antigen
     overwhelming the assay and producing a false negative. A presumptive identification
     occurs if either of the two HHA results is positive. A presumptive identification requires
     additional analysis by the LBDT using JBAIDS and/or M1M or by a properly certified
     lab within the LRN. (Note: Follow American Society for Testing and Materials [ASTM]
     Standard E2458-10, Standard Practices for Bulk Sample Collection and Swab Sample
     Collection of Visible Powders Suspected of Being Biological Agents from Nonporous
     Surfaces, for biological sample collection methods.)

     9.3.1.2. Biological Agent Aerosols. For biological agent aerosol threats, air sampling
     may be accomplished using dry filter units (DFUs), the XMX/2L sampler, etc. Follow
     the guidance outlined in the most current Air Force DFU CONOPs for air sample
     collection, packaging, etc. As with suspicious powders, all air sample filters must be put
     into a liquid phosphate buffered solution before delivery to the LBDT. If a biological
     toxin is suspected, HHAs can be used as a screening tool. However, HHAs are not very
     reliable as a screening tool for biological pathogens so the recommended practice is to
     deliver all suspect pathogen samples to the LBDT for analysis.

     9.3.1.3. A positive result on the JBAIDS (or comparable PCR technology) for a
     suspicious powder or aerosol sample should be followed up with confirmation analysis
     by a lab within the LRN. The LBDT will coordinate the additional analysis. (See
     Chapter 10 for more information.)


     9.3.1.4. Installation MTF labs will reject samples that are not properly sealed and
     accompanied by proper chain-of-custody documentation.

         9.3.1.4.1. The BEE team should not deliver raw environmental samples to the LBDT.
         Raw environmental samples are samples in their original state at the time of
         collection (e.g., dry powder, bulk solid, air sample filter). Raw samples must be
         transferred into a screw-capped vial containing a phosphate buffer solution or another
         transport medium. The container should be decontaminated and double bagged at the
         sample collection site by qualified BE personnel or equivalent before being
78                                                          AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

            transported or delivered to the LBDT. Coordinate with the LBDT for proper
            collection and delivery of samples.

            9.3.1.4.2. The BEE team must deliver samples with a valid, accurate, state-approved
            chain-of-custody form with all contextual information to include results of field
            screening tests and the purpose for subsequent laboratory analysis.

     9.3.2. Response to Unknown Suspicious Liquids. BEE team members responding with the
     EM flight to unknown liquids have capabilities to identify and, in some cases, quantify the
     substance or mixture.

        9.3.2.1. At a minimum, BEE team members should use Level A PPE when responding
        initially to unknown hazards. Once the hazards are known and the level of risk is
        properly characterized, personnel can recommend downgrade of PPE levels to the IC.
        Recommended equipment to bring to the response site include the lower explosive limit
        (LEL)/O2 meter, photoionization detector (PID)/flame ionization detector (FID),
        HazMatID, EPDs, 451P, HAPSITE (40ml vials if the Headspace is needed), M256 kit (if
        a CW agent is suspected), M272 kit (if a warfare agent is suspected in water), scene
        documentation equipment, and the Quicksilver Kit.

        9.3.2.2. If the BEE or EM team is unable to positively identify the substance with the
        initial set of equipment, additional follow-on equipment may be needed. This equipment
        can include any AS 886H item, which will be determined based on results from the initial
        screening.

        9.3.2.3. If a threat agent is presumptively confirmed by test results (e.g., HAPSITE,
        HazMatID, M256 kits), a sample will be collected and sent to a pre-identified Air Force-
        approved laboratory for full analysis to include definitive identification and confirmation.

     9.3.3. Response to Unknown Suspicious Solids and Suspected Ground Contamination.
     BEE team members responding to solid hazards have capabilities to identify the substance or
     mixture.

        9.3.3.1. Once the type of hazard has been properly identified as a solid (i.e., dusty agent,
        radioactive particles), BEE team members responding to unknown exposure levels should
        initially be in Level B PPE. The team can recommend downgrade to Level C as
        appropriate once the exposure risks have been properly characterized. Recommended
        equipment to bring to the response site includes the LEL/O2 meter, PID/FID, HazMatID,
        radioactivity, detection, indication, and computation (RADIAC) equipment (e.g., ADM-
        300, 451P, SAM-940, RaDeCo), EPDs, 40ml vials if Headspace is needed (i.e., for
        contaminated soils), scene documentation equipment, and the Quicksilver Kit.

        9.3.3.2. If the BEE team is unable to positively identify the substance with the initial set
        of equipment, additional follow-on equipment may be needed. This equipment can
        include any 886H AS item, which will be determined based on results from the initial
        screening.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                      79



     9.3.3.3. If a warfare agent is presumptively confirmed through testing (e.g., by
     HAPSITE, HazMatID, M256 kits), a sample will be collected and sent to a pre-identified
     Air Force-approved laboratory for full analysis and confirmation.

  9.3.4. Suspected Food or Water Contamination. PH should be consulted on food
  contamination. For possible water contamination, drinking water supplies should be
  monitored, and the BEE team chief should advise on boiling, outside procurement, or other
  decontamination requirements.

  9.3.5. Response Actions. While the installation Emergency Manager is responsible for
  integrating initial efforts with follow-on response teams to include federal, state, and local
  responders, the BEE team is responsible for supporting the response from the initial to the
  follow-on phases. BEE team personnel are responsible for the following actions.

     9.3.5.1. Confirm the ECP is established in an area that is not contaminated and is not
     likely to become contaminated.

     9.3.5.2. Depending on intelligence and tailored to the particular threat, increase
     monitoring of installation water supplies to ensure potability and availability. Report
     results to the EOC.

     9.3.5.3. Collect samples and, if appropriate, prepare for transport using DOT or IATA-
     approved containers to approved testing laboratories as identified by the IEMP 10-2,
     MCRP, or LRN. Coordinate with the LBDT for containers and chain-of-custody forms.

     9.3.5.4. Employ AS 886H assets to determine the OEH impact of chemical, biological,
     and radiological agents. Support may be required from the LBDT. Report results to the
     MCC and EOC, if available. If the MCC is not available, notify the chain of command.

     9.3.5.5. Advise the IC of immediate health hazards and recommended protective
     measures and courses of action.

     9.3.5.6. During responses to radiological incidents, implement a monitoring plan for
     responders and medical first receivers using EPDs and other monitoring devices to
     capture potential exposures. See AFI 48-148, Ionizing Radiation Protection, and
     AFMAN 48-125, Personnel Ionizing Radiation Dosimetry, for more information and
     policy on radiation dosimetry.

  9.3.6. CBRN Incidents with Warning. Upon receipt of a warning (e.g., meeting and
  decision by the installation TWG), activate the BEE team and commence pre-incident actions
  IAW the MCRP (IEMP 10-2 for AFRC bases). These actions may include establishing
  communications with the MCC and other designated work centers. The team chief is
  responsible for the following actions:
80                                                           AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

        9.3.6.1. Assign specific responsibilities to each member of the BEE team according to
        the current situation and mission priorities.

        9.3.6.2. Determine the immediate availability of additional equipment and supplies
        through previously established MAAs, MOAs, and MOUs.

     9.3.7. CBRN Incidents without Warning. For CBRN incidents that occur without
     warning, the team should implement the same procedures as an incident with warning and do
     the following:

        9.3.7.1. Compare projected requirements with immediately available caches from all
        local sources and report projected deficiencies to the MCC. (For AFRC bases, projected
        deficiencies should be reported to the BOS control center or equivalent.)

        9.3.7.2. When activated, deliver on-site support as directed by the IC. Gather
        intelligence from the fire entry team that performed rescue operations and site
        characterization (pictures of affected location, container size, and characteristic of liquid,
        solid, and powder).

        9.3.7.3. Perform HRAs of any potential hazards and make recommendations to the IC.
        Conduct follow-on assessments after the initial detection efforts performed by the
        emergency management flight or HAZMAT response team to identify and quantify
        hazards. Evaluate the hazard based on these measurements and possibly other data and
        communicate risks and hazard control recommendations to the IC.

        9.3.7.4. BEE team members may be required to comply with OSHA standards, depending
        on the situation. OSHA requirements for HAZMAT operations include the provision of
        pre- and post-entry medical screening and continuous medical support for personnel
        dealing with or performing operations involving HAZMAT, search and rescue, and entry
        into the hot zone. OSHA standards do not apply during uniquely military operations
        IAW EO 12196 and 29CFR1960.2.

9.4. Manning. As the situation or FPCON dictates, at least one BEE team member must be
available for immediate recall. This individual must be a fully qualified and trained 5-level BE
technician or higher. The BEE team may consist of all fully qualified members of the BEE
flight. The number of BEE personnel required for response is scenario driven and also depends
on the availability of local EM resources.

9.5. Integration. MTF response planning must include integration and coordination with other
organizations that have initial and follow-on responsibilities, including local, state, and federal
agencies.

     9.5.1. Coordination and Team Support. The BEE team will coordinate planning with
     other medical unit and non-medical unit teams as well as off-installation responders
     responsible for CBRN incident response. The BEE team coordinates with initial response
     teams assigned as first responders and emergency responders to the scene as well as medical
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                    81

  manpower/security and facilities teams tasked with planning for and implementing adequate
  protective measures at the medical unit during contingency responses. The BEE team might
  collaborate with and support the following other teams:

     9.5.1.1. The BEE response team coordinates with the PHO and PHEO to provide
     collaborative expertise to installation commanders on biological effects, health-based risk
     assessments and operations. The BEE team should routinely collaborate with the PHO to
     review disease and syndromic surveillance and with the PHEO to review medical
     intelligence information as part of the HRA process. Such action may lead to
     identification of a potential endemic disease outbreak or reveal a covert biological attack.

     9.5.1.2. The patient decontamination team is tasked with effectively managing
     significant numbers of live casualties who present to the medical unit and may be
     contaminated with biological, chemical, or radioactive hazards. All wastewater used to
     decontaminate patients is captured in a bladder. They may consult with the BEE team on
     handling of the wastewater. The BEE team may also be required to collect a sample of
     the wastewater for hazardous waste characterization before disposal (if requested by the
     Installation Management Flight).

     9.5.1.3. The pharmacy team is responsible for developing plans and procedures for the
     acquisition, reception, control, and distribution of pharmaceutical supplies necessary to
     support a CBRN incident. The BEE team may need to advise on proper
     radiopharmaceuticals, depending on local TIC/TIM threats.

     9.5.1.4. The LBDT is tasked with providing rapid identification of potential biological
     agents released at the scene or in clinical samples. The BEE team should pre-coordinate
     with the LBDT on chain-of-custody forms, proper packaging materials for samples, etc.

     9.5.1.5. Depending on the scenario, other specialty teams may be required by various
     DOD instructions and directives (e.g., medical unit smallpox vaccination or treatment
     teams.)

  9.5.2. Horizontal Integration. BEE team members should be familiar with the CBRN
  planning and incident response procedures contained in IEMP 10-2. The BEE team should
  plan for integrated response with other installation and off-installation response teams as
  appropriate.

     9.5.2.1. CEX is the primary facilitator for on-scene command, control, and
     communications. They provide initial hazard determination (hazard plot and/or initial
     agent detection). The BEE team may use hazard plots/data provided by CEX to refine
     CBRN hazard identification and quantification. Information sharing and interaction (e.g.,
     joint training, exercises) between CEX and BE are critical to providing effective mission
     support. Team capabilities are maximized when these organizations work together
     during a CBRN response.
82                                                          AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

         9.5.2.2. The Fire Emergency Services (FES) is typically the first responder to a CBRN
         incident. They provide initial C2 by establishing the ICS and establish gross
         decontamination for responders and victims. While FES is trained for HAZMAT
         operations, the BEE team provides expertise and advice on HRA.

         9.5.2.3. The HAZMAT response team is responsible for controlling the hazardous
         release and performing cleanup. This team may provide their own decontamination
         capability. The BEE team works closely with the HAZMAT response team to provide
         HRA support.

         9.5.2.4. The EOD team responds to potential CBRN incidents involving explosives.
         Joint training between BE and EOD should be considered.

     9.5.3. Interaction with Civilian Response Resources. The BEE team might interact with
     civilian response resources (e.g., state environmental and EPA responders, HAZMAT
     response teams, civil support teams [CSTs], and emergency medical personnel).

         9.5.3.1. The installation commander can send military personnel to respond to off-base
         incidents in certain circumstances such as imminently serious conditions resulting from a
         civil emergency or an attack on civilian assets to save lives, prevent human suffering, or
         mitigate significant property damage. Local military commanders subject to direction
         provided by their regional planning agent may take necessary action to respond to a civil
         authority’s request for CBRN incident support. BEE personnel may be tasked to support
         this request.

         9.5.3.2. A CBRN event occurring on-installation may require assistance from off-
         installation responders. The BEE team must understand what local resources exist, their
         capabilities, and how to interact effectively with counterparts in the civilian response
         force.

     9.5.4. Vertical Integration. All communications and requests for assistance or information
     by or to higher echelon or supporting Air Force or DOD commands, as well as state and
     other non-DOD federal follow-on resources must be coordinated through the MCC or EOC
     IAW the MCRP. The BEE team must not communicate directly with outside agencies
     without prior approval from the MCC.

9.6. Equipment and Supplies. AS 886H requirements are based on the equipment and
quantities of supplies necessary to sample and analyze gas, liquid, and solid contaminants/agents
for a 24 hour period (for AFRC bases, up to an 8 hour period) such that a comprehensive HRA
can be accomplished IAW AFI 48-145. These materials include the following sub-assemblages:

     •   Sub-assemblage C1–Communication items
     •   Sub-assemblage DB–Diagnostic and surveillance biological
     •   Sub-assemblage DI–Diagnostic and surveillance chemical

                                            Chapter 10

                        LABORATORY BIOLOGICAL DETECTION

10.1. Introduction. This chapter outlines the roles and procedures AFMS laboratories perform
in CBRN defense. It addresses the role of the Laboratory Biological Detection Team (LBDT) in
providing specific, rapid detection of BTAs from suspect samples.

     10.1.1. LBDT Overview. The LBDT provides installation commanders with rapid,
     pathogen-specific identification. The LBDT contains instrumentation that can identify BTAs
     of medical and operational importance from various sample types. The main instrumentation
     associated with the LBDT are JBAIDS and M1M. JBAIDS and M1M meet the Services’
     needs to enhance the survivability of U.S. forces in a biological threat environment. JBAIDS
     and M1M allow the DOD to standardize testing and identification procedures across the
     Services. JBAIDS is a molecular biology instrument system that uses PCR technology to
     identify BTAs. The M1M system adds a complementary capability to the JBAIDS
     technology. M1M uses electrochemiluminescence (ECL) technology for the identification of
     certain toxins. Note: The M1M capability has been transitioned to only OCONUS
     installations IAW the Aug 2011 policy.

     10.1.2. Background. Incidents such as the March 1995 Aum Shinrikyo, Tokyo subway
     attack and the intentional release of weaponized anthrax spores through the U.S. Postal
     Service in October 2001 heightened awareness of the vulnerability of DOD and U.S. civilian
     personnel to the deliberate release of biological and chemical agents. Recognizing the role of
     public health in terrorism preparedness and planning, the CDC formed the Strategic Planning
     Workgroup in Preparedness and Response to Biological and Chemical Terrorism. The group
     included members from the CDC, law enforcement, intelligence, defense, and medical
     communities. Their focus was to develop an overarching strategy to help public health
     organizations recognize the signs of a potential covert attack and to strengthen an already
     overburdened system’s ability to respond. The group’s recommendations were published in
     the 21 April 2000 CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), “Biological and
     Chemical Terrorism: Strategic Plan for Preparedness and Response.” Recommendations
     included the establishment of a nationwide LRN to assist in the rapid detection and
     determination of a biological event, whether overt, covert, man-made, or naturally occurring,
     as an early warning and reporting tool.

        10.1.2.1. In spring 2000, the DOD Center for Clinical Laboratory Medicine (CCLM)
        directed all CONUS military clinical laboratories to enroll in the CDC network. It
        directed all OCONUS clinical laboratories to establish a CDC sentinel laboratory-
        equivalent or higher capability. CDC sentinel laboratories are those within the LRN that
        are capable of analyzing or referring samples and specimens suspected of containing
        biological agents.

        10.1.2.2. All the Surgeons General are in agreement with and have signed and ordered
        adherence to this policy across their service laboratory structure.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                       85

10.2. Laboratory Response Network (LRN). The LRN is an integrated network of state and
local public health, federal, military, and international laboratories that can respond to
bioterrorism, chemical terrorism, and other public health emergencies. The LRN laboratories are
grouped into four categories based on their testing and diagnostic capabilities: basic sentinel,
advanced sentinel, reference, and national laboratories, as shown in Figure 10.1. Most Air Force
medical laboratories operate at the basic or advanced sentinel level. IAW AFI 41-106, medical
unit laboratories certified under the CCLM as a base sentinel site for microbiology must
participate in the CDC’s LRN as a basic sentinel site. Basic sentinel laboratories have
procedures and policies in place to ship suspect specimens to the nearest LRN reference
laboratory. Laboratories registered to perform high complexity microbiology serve as advanced
sentinel sites and can conduct basic tests to rule out the presence of certain BTAs in clinical
specimens. Note: The LBDT does not directly support the LRN. The two programs are
separate and distinct.

               Figure 10.1. Laboratory Response Network (LRN) Structure




   10.2.1. Sentinel Laboratories. Sentinel laboratories represent the thousands of hospital-
   based laboratories that are on the front lines. Sentinel laboratories have direct contact with
86                                                           AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

     patients. In an unannounced or covert terrorist attack, patients provide specimens during
     routine patient care. Sentinel laboratories could be the first facility to spot a suspicious
     specimen. A sentinel laboratory’s responsibility is to refer a suspicious sample to the right
     reference laboratory.

     10.2.2. Reference Laboratories. Reference laboratories, sometimes referred to as
     confirmatory reference laboratories, can perform tests to detect and confirm the presence of a
     threat agent. These laboratories are capable of producing conclusive results without having
     to rely on definitive results from laboratories at the CDC. This capability ensures a timely
     local response to a terrorist incident. The Air Force LRN reference laboratory is located at
     Wright Patterson AFB, OH.

     10.2.3. National Laboratories. National laboratories have unique resources to handle
     highly infectious agents and the ability to identify specific agent strains. Examples include
     the CDC, USAMRIID, and the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC).

10.3. Capabilities and Limitations. The LBDT is an in-place capability at CONUS and
OCONUS sites that provides expertise in biological identification and risk analysis. Members of
the LBDT are trained to handle, process, and test clinical specimens (human origin) as well as
safely collected environmental samples (to include food) suspected or known to contain BTAs.
BTAs include but are not limited to toxins, bacterial agents, and viral agents. The LBDT may be
used to augment existing and future in-place force protection capabilities.

     10.3.1. Microbiology Techniques. The LBDT uses integrated technology consistent with
     the Air Force deployable biological augmentation team (UTC FFBAT) and equipment set
     (UTC FFBA1). Currently employed technologies include nucleic acid-based
     (deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]/ribonucleic acid [RNA]) identification by means of PCR and
     antibody/immuno-based identification using ECL. The latter technology augments the
     detection and identification capabilities of the LBDT by adding toxin detection to the
     repertoire of BTA testing.

     10.3.2. Environmental Testing. Each medical unit with the LBDT capability must support
     environmental testing locally if they have AS 886I. The LBDT must also determine and
     contact their LRN reference laboratory to ensure they can refer samples that may possibly
     contain BTAs. Medical units without an LBDT should send suspect environmental samples
     and clinical specimens that cannot be ruled out for BTAs to the appropriate local LRN
     laboratory.

     10.3.3. LRN Shipments. A specimen (split sample) should be sent through the LRN
     simultaneously whenever a specimen is submitted to the LBDT especially if it is truly
     suspect for a BTA. Environmental samples and clinical specimens testing positive or
     indeterminate for a BTA with LBDT testing technologies should also be sent to the
     appropriate local LRN for confirmatory testing. Proper sample collection, handling and
     packaging procedures, and chain of custody must be completed for each specimen/sample.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                  87

  10.3.4. Analytical Platforms. JBAIDS is the LBDT’s primary analytical platform. A select
  number of sites received the M1M to add to their LBDT capability. Table 10.1 lists the BTA
  assay kits provided in AS 886I for JBAIDS and M1M.

     10.3.4.1. JBAIDS is a re-useable, portable, modifiable identification and diagnostic
     system for BTAs. It is configured to support reliable, fast, and specific identification of
     BTAs from a variety of clinical specimens and environmental samples.

     10.3.4.2. The M1M uses ECL technology and is capable of providing in-vitro
     identification of toxins, bacteria, and viruses from a variety of environmental samples and
     clinical specimens.

                     Table 10.1. AS 886I JBAIDS and M1M Assays
                JBAIDS                                        M1M
   Anthrax Target 1 (Bacillus anthracis)             Botulinum Toxin A/B/E
   Anthrax Target 2 (Bacillus anthracis)                   Ricin Toxin
          Brucella (Brucella sp.)                 Staphylococcus Enterotoxin B

     Plague Target 2 (Yersinia pestis)
      Q fever (Coxiella burnetii) (D)
      Small Pox Target 1 (Vaccinia)
       Small Pox Target 2 (Variola)
    Tularemia (Francisella tularensis)
       Typhus (Rickettsia typhi) (D)

  Note: Deferred (D) items are not sent to each LBDT. They are centrally managed and
  delivered to an individual LBDT upon request by the medical unit commander or designee.

  10.3.5. Facility Requirements. Current Air Force policy dictates the LBDT must have a
  facility outside or separate from the medical facility to prepare environmental samples for
  testing (reference AFI 41-106, paragraph 7.2.5.2.). Compliance with this requirement may
  involve acquiring a facility of opportunity on the installation and performing extensive
  modifications to bring the facility up to BSL-2 standards. The delay in waiting for a facility
  and the huge costs associated with modifications could lead to a gap in capability. If a
  medical unit is faced with these challenges, this situation must be discussed in the MRC
  meeting to determine potential options. The medical group commander may opt to bring
  properly prepared samples into the MTF’s clinical laboratory for testing on the JBAIDS or
  M1M analyzer if the lab is large enough to accommodate the different processes. The
  commander must authorize it in writing and include a certification that a local risk evaluation
  has been completed by BE personnel. Regardless of whether sample testing is performed in
  a separate facility or within the MTF, suspected equine encephalitis and smallpox samples
88                                                          AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

     should not be analyzed but should instead be processed and shipped to a higher level
     reference laboratory (i.e., BSL-3 for equine encephalitis and BSL-4 for smallpox).

10.4. Concept of Operations. In general, samples suspected of containing a BTA should be
coordinated with the FBI (through the AFOSI) and processed through the LRN. IAW the
National Response Framework, made effective on 22 March 08, the FBI assumes oversight for
investigations involving BTAs found in samples on federal installations in CONUS.

     10.4.1. Environmental Samples. Environmental samples suspected of containing BTAs
     should be tested using JBAIDS or M1M. Advanced LRN sentinel protocols should not be
     used to test environmental samples. Samples that test positive on JBAIDS or M1M must be
     sent to an LRN reference laboratory for further analysis. Consult the JBAIDS Joint TTP and
     JBAIDS and M1M operating instructions (OIs) for testing procedures. This information is
     available on the Laboratory Readiness Skills web page on the AFMS Knowledge Exchange
     at the following URL: https://kx.afms.mil/labreadinessskills

     10.4.2. Clinical Specimens. Clinical specimens should be tested with advanced sentinel
     LRN procedures and may be tested using FDA-cleared reagents as appropriate if requested
     by the PHEO. Samples that cannot be ruled out to contain BTAs using advanced sentinel
     procedures or that test positive using JBAIDS or M1M should be forwarded to the nearest
     LRN reference facility for further analysis. The LRN sentinel level clinical laboratory
     guidelines are available on the ASM website at the following URL:
     http://www.asm.org/index.php/policy/sentinel-level-clinical-microbiology-laboratory-
     guidelines.html

     10.4.3. Suspect Specimens. Suspect clinical specimens may be tested with FDA-cleared
     reagents if there is a declaration of a public health emergency by the wing commander. It is
     best to funnel suspect clinical specimens into the LRN as soon as possible.

     10.4.4. LBDT Activation. LBDT members must be fully qualified before activation.
     Current intelligence data about threat agents, clinical agents of concern, and endemic disease
     should be collected. When required, the team may be activated to provide advanced
     microbiological diagnostic support. The team can be activated by the medical unit
     commander or MCC to assist BE or PH personnel in performing force protection duties for
     fixed-site installation defense operations. The LBDT may also be activated to provide local
     or regional testing support for other DOD facilities as approved by the medical unit
     commander or wing commander.

     10.4.5. Sample Collection and Chain of Custody. Environmental sample collection is the
     joint responsibility of the BEE team, fire and emergency services flight, and the readiness
     and emergency management flight IAW their instructions. Food samples are the one
     exception to environmental sampling. Food sample collection is the responsibility of PH
     personnel. All clinical specimens must be collected by medical service personnel. The
     LBDT shall not perform environmental sample or clinical specimen collection. The LBDT
     provides consultation, as needed, regarding the types and sources of sample specimens to
     collect. Samples suspected of containing BTA must be collected using accepted chain-of-
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                   89

  custody procedures with all information such as results of field screening tests and the
  purpose of the subsequent laboratory analysis.

     10.4.5.1. Use the chain of custody form posted on the AFMS Knowledge Exchange if it
     complies with local and state requirements or use specific state-approved forms. The
     chain of custody form is located on the Lab Readiness Skills web page, under the Chem-
     Bio Defense CONOPS/TTPs/OIs/ Manuals tab, at the following URL:
     https://kx.afms.mil/labreadinessskills

     10.4.5.2. Ensure installation plans include the chain-of-custody form to be used so that
     all base responders use a standardized, compliant form.

  10.4.6. Sample Processing. Sample processing methods and the time required for analysis
  depend on the sample type. JBAIDS sample preparation and analysis time can range from
  three to four hours depending on the type and number of samples or tests being analyzed.
  M1M sample preparation and analysis can range from one to two hours. Personnel should
  use standard precautions (e.g., gloves, N95 mask, laboratory coat, other PPE as warranted)
  when collecting and handling samples. All samples are considered infectious and potential
  threats until determined otherwise. Samples should be processed following BSL-2
  precautions. Samples submitted for analysis should always be in solution (such as phosphate
  buffered solution) inside a secured/screw-cap container and then double-bagged with all
  surfaces decontaminated before acceptance. Lab technicians should not open any samples
  until they are inside the hood. That includes material used to double-bag the sample, as well
  as the specimen container. The centrifuge should only be used inside the hood. Samples
  should be properly repackaged before taking them out of the hood.

  10.4.7. Split Samples. Following sample receipt, prepare an aliquot of the collected sample
  for the LRN and LBDT. Ensure that a chain-of-custody form accompanies each sample and
  document every sample aliquot prepared. If the sample size is not adequate to perform the
  analysis and split the sample for confirmatory analysis, consult the PHEO for guidance. In
  most cases, the entire sample should be immediately sent to the nearest LRN reference
  laboratory for analysis.

  10.4.8. Sample Analysis Procedures. Consult the following resources for information on
  sample analysis procedures.

     10.4.8.1. Detailed sample processing procedures for JBAIDS and M1M are available in
     the OIs posted on the Lab Readiness Skills web page on the AFMS Knowledge
     Exchange.

     10.4.8.2. See the JBAIDS Joint TTP and M1M User Guide/Systems Manual for sample
     processing protocols and sample analysis procedures.

     10.4.8.3. See the JBAIDS System Manual for analyzer and software operation
     procedures.

        10.4.8.4. LRN procedures, including the Sentinel Level Clinical Laboratory Guidelines,
        are available on the ASM website at the following URL:
        http://www.asm.org/index.php/policy/sentinel-level-clinical-microbiology-laboratory-
        guidelines.html

     10.4.9. Results Interpretation. Initial LBDT results including the number, sources, and
     types of clinical and environmental samples collected and tested should be reported to the
     senior laboratory officer, attending physician, medical unit commander, PHEO, BEE, and
     other appropriate agencies, such as PH, the MCC, and local and regional public health
     authorities IAW local procedures. For samples submitted by DOD agencies outside the
     installation, the medical commander is responsible for informing the agency of the result and
     for providing the summary of the laboratory analysis to the installation commander.
     Suspicious BTA results should be coordinated with the FBI (through the AFOSI) and the
     nearest reference LRN laboratory, following rule-in using LRN sentinel protocols for clinical
     specimens and JBAIDS and M1M testing for clinical (not validated) and environmental
     samples.

        10.4.9.1. The JBAIDS software analyzes PCR results and determines whether the nucleic
        acid of the biological agent being tested for is present in the sample. Samples are tested
        in duplicate and the JBAIDS software reports a combined result. See the JBAIDS OI on
        the Laboratory Readiness Skills web page on the AFMS Knowledge Exchange for
        detailed result interpretation.

        10.4.9.2. The M1M software analyzes ECL results and determines if the target (i.e.,
        toxin) being analyzed is contained in the sample. Samples are tested in duplicate, and the
        M1M software reports a result for each duplicate sample. See the M1M OI on the
        Laboratory Readiness Skills web page on the AFMS Knowledge Exchange for detailed
        result interpretation.

        10.4.9.3. Consult the LRN protocols for proper results interpretation of LRN sentinel
        procedures.

     10.4.10. Use of Non FDA-Cleared Assays for Clinical Specimens. Do not use non FDA-
     cleared assays for clinical specimens. Submit clinical specimens to the appropriate LRN
     laboratory for BTA testing.

     10.4.11. Forwarding Samples to LRN Reference or National Laboratories. Any clinical
     specimen or environmental sample that is truly suspect for BTA should be sent to an LRN
     reference laboratory regardless of the JBAIDS and M1M result.

        10.4.11.1. Notify the LRN reference laboratory that a suspect BTA sample is being
        shipped for analysis. Results from JBAIDS and M1M are not reportable to the LRN.
        Only results generated using LRN sanctioned protocols can be reported to the LRN. In
        CONUS, the LRN and FBI (via the AFOSI) policies and procedures take precedence.
        Testing of these samples must be done IAW LRN and FBI policies.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                  91

       10.4.11.2. Each laboratory must have IATA trained and certified personnel to properly
       pack and ship samples suspected of containing BTAs. It is the responsibility of the
       laboratory flight commander or chief of laboratory services to ensure qualified personnel
       are available in the laboratory. BE personnel will assist the LBDT, as needed, with
       proper sample packaging, chain of custody forms, and arrangements for shipping.

          10.4.11.2.1. For OCONUS locations, the U.S. Army 22nd Chemical Battalion
          (Technical Escort) provides transportation from the LBDT to a confirmatory or
          definitive laboratory. IAW FM 3-11.86/MCWP 3.37.1C/NTTP 3-11.31/AFTTP (I) 3-
          2.52, Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Biological Surveillance, if
          the technical escort unit does not have anyone available and the shipment is urgent,
          the installation commander may designate a courier. Regulations for international
          and airline transportation must be followed IAW AFMAN 24-204, Preparing
          Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipments, IATA Dangerous Goods
          Regulations (DGR), IATA Infectious Substance Shipping Guidelines (ISSG), and the
          World Health Organization’s Guidance on Regulations for the Transport of Infectious
          Substances. FEDEX is authorized to transport shipments via air/ground for testing.
          The shipment must be properly packaged IAW IATA guidelines for the sample type
          (Category A, B, etc.).

          10.4.11.2.2. For CONUS locations, positive, presumptive positive, indeterminate
          clinical specimens, and environmental samples should be shipped to an LRN
          reference or national laboratory IAW proper shipping procedures. Environmental
          samples that test positive should be handled by the FBI (coordinated through the
          AFOSI) who may transport the sample to the appropriate LRN laboratory.

10.5. Manning. The LBDT is composed of two personnel: a laboratory officer or civilian
technologist and an enlisted 4T or civilian technician. Both team members must receive
classroom and hands-on training before beginning on-site operations. All members of the LBDT
must be trained and knowledgeable regarding the clearly defined role of the LBDT and how it
supports the national LRN. The laboratory flight commander/chief, laboratory services or
designee, is responsible for implementation and maintenance of the LBDT and its participation
in the LRN IAW AFI 41-106.

   10.5.1. Biomedical Laboratory Officer (43T3X). The laboratory officer assigned to the
   facility must have successfully completed the JBAIDS course and have hands-on experience
   in basic and advanced microbiological diagnostics techniques including PCR technology.
   Experience in running immunoassay techniques (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay
   [ELISA], enzyme immunoassay [EIA], ECL), HHAs, and general clinical laboratory
   experience is preferred. The officer must know and be able to explain to clinicians, senior
   medical personnel, and installation officials the capabilities and limitations of each testing
   method, identification sensitivities and specificities, and management of sample results
   including the role of the national LRN, the Army’s Technical Escort Unit, and capabilities of
   referral laboratories (reference and national). The team chief must have at least a current
   secret security clearance.

     10.5.2. Government or Contract Civilian Medical Technologist. If the biomedical
     laboratory officer is already assigned to a UTC, an experienced medical technologist
     assigned to the laboratory may be assigned as the LBDT chief instead. The medical
     technologist assigned as team chief must be certified by the American Society for Clinical
     Pathology (ASCP) or equivalent, have successfully completed the JBAIDS course, and have
     hands-on experience in basic and advanced microbiological diagnostics techniques including
     PCR technology. Experience in running immunoassay techniques (ELISA/EIA/ECL),
     HHAs, and general clinical laboratory experience is preferred. The team chief must know
     and be able to explain to clinicians and senior medical and installation officials the
     capabilities and limitations of each testing method, identification sensitivities and
     specificities, and management of sample results including the role of the national LRN, the
     Army’s Technical Escort Unit, and capabilities of referral laboratories (reference and
     national). The team chief must have at least a current secret security clearance.

     10.5.3. Enlisted Laboratory Technician (4T0X1). The enlisted laboratory technician may
     be assigned as the team technician. The laboratory technician must have attended and
     successfully completed the JBAIDS course and have experience in basic and advanced rapid
     diagnostics techniques (e.g., PCR, ELISA/ECL, and HHAs) to include sample preparation
     and isolation techniques. The laboratory technician must understand nucleic acid based
     identification techniques to include test design and sample preparation and be well skilled in
     advanced nucleic acid based and immuno-based laboratory equipment usage. The laboratory
     technician must understand sample and reagent logistical issues such as storage needs and
     methods for ordering additional reagents and understand results reporting and sample referral
     for confirmatory and definitive testing. The position requires at least a current secret security
     clearance.

     10.5.4. Government or Contract Civilian Medical Laboratory Technician. If the
     enlisted medical laboratory technician is already assigned to other UTCs, an experienced
     medical laboratory technician (ASCP) or equivalent technician may be assigned as the team
     technician upon successfully completing the JBAIDS course. The medical laboratory
     technician must understand nucleic acid based identification techniques to include test design
     and sample preparation and be well skilled in advanced nucleic acid based and immuno-
     based laboratory equipment usage. The laboratory technician must understand sample and
     reagent logistical issues such as storage needs and methods for ordering additional reagents
     and understand results reporting and sample referral for confirmatory and definitive testing.
     This position requires at least a secret security clearance.

10.6. Integration. LBDT capabilities may be used in conjunction or work closely with the
other MC-CBRN capabilities such as the BE (AS 886H) and PH (AS 886P) teams. The LBDT’s
JBAIDS and M1M equipment are not interoperable with or connected to other systems. They
are stand-alone laboratory instruments that produce test results from samples submitted for
analysis. LBDT personnel may need to communicate with their technical reach-back resources
within the services, HHQ and medical commands, the national reference laboratories, and the
LRN.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                93

10.7. Equipment and Supplies. AS 886I provides instrumentation, supplies, and equipment to
identify BTAs from various sample types. It does not include radios or other communications
equipment. Communications equipment must be obtained from the MCC. AS 886I includes the
following sub-assemblages:

   •   Sub-Asssemblage AA–Admin
   •   Sub-Assemblage C1–Communications Items
   •   Sub Assemblage DE–Diagnostics and Surveillance Electrochemiluminescence
   •   Sub Assemblage PD–Diagnostics and Surveillance PCR
   •   Sub Assemblage I1–Infrastructure
   •   Sub Assemblage S1–Safety

   10.7.1. CDC and LRN Testing Supplies. The CDC provides reagents free of charge to all
   registered reference and national laboratories. The CDC does not provide reagents for LRN
   sentinel laboratories. Minimal costs will be incurred for routine laboratory supplies
   (consumables and accessories) required for processing samples. All laboratories are
   expected to use the nearest local reference laboratory to minimize shipping costs. A local
   courier may transport samples as long as the established chain of custody is not
   compromised. It is imperative that CDC, DOD, and host nation protocols be followed with
   respect to all manner of processing, testing, or transporting samples.

   10.7.2. M1M Supplies. The Critical Reagent Program is the source for M1M minitubes,
   control material, diluents, and calibrators. Non-programmed requirements should be
   identified by the MRO who will coordinate the request with the applicable MAJCOM/SGX.
   Note: M1M is only used at OCONUS locations.

   10.7.3. JBAIDS Supplies and Equipment. JBAIDS is maintained according to the Joint
   Maintenance and Logistics Concept. See the JBAIDS Joint TTP for more information.

       10.7.3.1. JBAIDS maintenance and reach-back information is available from the
       manufacturer, Idaho Technology, at the following URL: https://jbaids.idahotech.com

       10.7.3.2. Support is available around the clock, 365 days per year, from the Idaho
       Technology help desk at the following email address: support@idahotech.com

       10.7.3.3. Resupply of probes, extraction kits, and controls is accomplished by creating
       on-line requisitions in DMLSS. Non-programmed or emergency resupply of probes and
       extraction kits should be done IAW the JBAIDS Deferred Procurement Plan. Other
       supply items should be ordered using normal processes through the laboratory and the
       medical logistics flight.

                                           Chapter 11

                                      FIELD RESPONSE

11.1. Introduction. This chapter provides procedures for field response capabilities. It will
assist medical unit planners in developing MCRP procedures to respond to a CBRN incident,
peacetime accident, or natural disaster and provide guidance on the management and
employment of AS 886J.

     11.1.1. Field Response Overview. Field response refers to the immediate medical CBRN
     response capability provided by AS 886J supplies. This capability must be integrated into
     MCRP procedures and checklists. AS 886J supplies are intended to be used by the FRT.
     New MCRP teams should not be created to implement this capability. The FRT chief
     manages AS 886J and coordinates how the supplies are packaged (e.g., grab and go).
     Procedures should be developed to access and incorporate the pharmaceuticals on AS 886E
     into the medical equipment and supply stocks of the AS 886J grab and go bags.

        11.1.1.1. Response to a CBRN event is managed by the IC using AFIMS and the
        installation’s IEMP 10-2. Team members must be trained and have an understanding of
        the risks and potential outcomes associated with a CBRN mass casualty event. The FRT
        must have the ability to recognize the need for additional resources and make appropriate
        notifications to the IC.

        11.1.1.2. Field response capability includes on-scene triage, treatment, and transport of
        CBRN casualties; medical support for HAZMAT operations; evidence preservation at the
        scene and the medical unit; triage of decontaminated casualties (gross decontamination
        performed by the fire department); clinical sample collection; disposition of casualties
        after emergency treatment (including fatality management); coordination with civilian
        transporters and treatment facilities; preparation for medical evacuation; assistance in
        mass prophylaxis dispensing or vaccination.

        11.1.1.3. Typically, the initial assessment and management of patients are performed by
        the responding ambulance service or EMS. Upon activation, the FRT must work in
        unison as part of the overall EMS scene response. Prospective planning that includes a
        unification process and site medical C2 should be developed.

        11.1.1.4. Additional MCRP teams may also provide field response if the number of
        casualties exceeds the capabilities of the FRT. Coordination with the MCC for support
        from additional MCRP teams and 886J AS assets will facilitate response. Requests for
        this support must flow from the incident site through the IC to the ESF #8 representative.
        The ESF #8 representative will contact the MCC. Before sending other teams to respond
        on-scene to a CBRN event, the MCC and commanders must ensure the teams are
        properly trained.

     11.1.2. Assumptions. The FRT must be able to respond and be functional at all times when
     the medical unit is open for emergency care and must be available for immediate recall after
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                      95

   hours. This team operates in the cold zone. However, based on environmental conditions at
   the incident site, the cordon and conditions may change and rapidly deteriorate. This
   situation may present an immediate hazard to responders, and responders may be directed by
   the IC to pull back to a safe location. The cordon and ECP will be re-established if
   necessary.

       11.1.2.1. FRT support will be required at the incident scene (e.g., the ECP, staging area,
       or other designated points) in support of the response effort. Before responding to the
       scene, FRT members should acquire the proper safe routes, as well as ECP and staging
       locations.

       11.1.2.2. Victim exposures will range from severe to mild (possibly only
       psychosomatic). Victims suffering severe exposure may collapse at the incident scene,
       while victims with mild exposure may depart the scene and seek medical attention
       immediately or later in the course of events.

11.2. Capabilities and Limitations. The FRT is capable of medically responding to and
supporting a CBRN event. AS 886J provides equipment and supplies to treat up to300
casualties. Capabilities include disaster medicine, field triage, and stabilization of casualties for
transport. MAAs, MOAs, and MOUs may be in place to provide or enhance AS 886J
capabilities. (Not applicable to AFRC medical units.)

11.3. Concept of Operations. This concept of operations focuses on the FRT’s ability to
respond to a CBRN mass casualty event using the equipment and supplies from AS 886J. Each
medical unit must tailor its MCRP Basic Plan and applicable annexes (D, H, etc.) to incorporate
the AS 886J capability and support the IEMP 10-2 and DCP.

   11.3.1. Activation. MCRP teams are activated by the medical unit commander, MCC, IC,
   or emergency room immediately upon notification of a suspected CBRN incident, as
   described in the MCRP. Immediate activation of MCRP teams is needed to ensure a
   comprehensive and timely response.

       11.3.1.1. The FRT is normally activated through the installation emergency
       communications center (ECC)/dispatch. Upon notification at the medical unit of a
       CBRN event, simultaneous activation of the patient decontamination, clinical, triage, and
       manpower/security teams is needed to prevent contaminated casualties from degrading
       the medical unit’s ability to function.

       11.3.1.2. MCRP teams will be notified immediately by the MCC of any change in
       FPCON that may affect the response.

       11.3.1.3. Upon activation, the FRT takes the proper safe route to the ECP carrying their
       field response bags from the AS 886J as needed. FRT may be the first to arrive on scene,
       depending on the scenario.
96                                                           AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

        11.3.1.4. If the event involves a CBRN release, FRT members should take the following
        steps to avoid contamination:

            11.3.1.4.1. Pull back to a safe distance – do not try to rescue or extract casualties.

            11.3.1.4.2. Make proper notifications and requests for assistance. Wait for the proper
            agencies to respond, such as the fire department and emergency services, so that the
            proper safety zones, staging areas, and other precautions can be established and
            patients can be decontaminated.

            11.3.1.4.3. If activated for response operations, the MCC assumes C2 of the various
            MCRP teams within the medical unit and coordinates activities for the FRT through
            the EOC. The IC (or ESF #8 if activated) assumes command of the FRT on-scene.

     11.3.2. Functional Elements. The FRT may include the following functional elements:

            11.3.2.1. The field triage element is responsible for initial triage of victims.

            11.3.2.2. The treatment element is responsible for stabilization and emergency
            treatment of victims at the scene after triage. This division may be further divided
            into sub-elements for each of the major triage categories (immediate, delayed, and
            minimal). Note: Field triage should not use AS 886K assets.

            11.3.2.3. The transportation element is responsible for movement of victims from the
            treatment area at the scene to ambulance loading sites and for movement of casualties
            to receiving facilities.

            11.3.2.4 The administrative element is responsible for initiating and maintaining
            tracking of patients. This element ensures casualties are tracked as they are
            transported from the incident scene, noting planned patient destinations upon
            departure.

     11.3.3. Field Triage of CBRN Casualties. Triage in a mass casualty setting should be
     performed rapidly and with minimal treatment. Field triage should focus on the effects from
     contamination as well as the severity of injuries. Triage should occur only in the cold zone
     after patients have been properly decontaminated.

        11.3.3.1. Where the scene is not fully controlled or when patients self-present, casualties
        may not have undergone gross decontamination. FRT members must have situational
        awareness. They must be able to recognize when a patient has not yet been
        decontaminated and be aware of where to direct patients for gross decontamination.
        Gross decontamination involves clothing removal (removes 75-90 percent of
        contaminants) and washing with water, so if patients are still clothed or have a strong
        odor, they have not been properly decontaminated and must be redirected immediately.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 97

     11.3.3.2. Recommended triage methods are as follows base on local requirements and
     standards.

         11.3.3.2.1. For incidents involving explosive agents (with or without radiation
         release), chemical agents with delayed onset of action, or overt release of biological
         agents, the Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment (START) algorithm (see Attachment
         8) the JumpSTART Pediatric Multi-casualty Incident (MCI) triage algorithm (see
         Attachment 9) and Sort- Assess- Lifesaving Interventions- Triage/Treatment (SALT)
         Triage System (see Attachment 10) provide systematic methods for rapid assessment
         and categorization of casualties-

         11.3.3.2.2. For incidents involving chemical agents with immediate onset of action
         and for which antidotes exist and are used in the out-of-hospital setting (e.g., nerve
         agents, organophosphates, or cyanide), prospectively modified triage algorithms that
         include timely administration of antidotes may be considered efficacious.

         11.3.3.2.3. Nothing in this AFTTP precludes the use of other triage methods,
         provided these alternate methods have been approved by a local competent medical
         authority and triage personnel have been trained in their use.

         11.3.3.2.4. Triage tagging systems that include the casualty’s decontamination status
         should be used. An example of such a tagging system is provided in Attachment 10.

  11.3.4. Field Treatment of CBRN Casualties. Treatment at the scene of a CBRN incident
  is typically based on presumptive diagnosis and might be limited by the availability and skills
  of the FRT, AS 886J, and existing resources. The FRT initiates treatment with the
  expectation that follow-on treatment will be performed by the medical unit’s clinical teams
  (immediate, delayed, and minimal) or at an off-installation facility (e.g., community
  healthcare facility).

     11.3.4.1. Treatment should follow pre-established treatment algorithms as defined in the
     MCRP. Note: If MAAs, MOAs, or MOUs task an outside EMS with the primary
     response, treatment algorithms should follow those of the EMS.

     11.3.4.2. Assess the signs and symptoms of exposure to potential CBRN agents or
     materials and provide appropriate treatment.

     11.3.4.3. Implement methods for managing CBRN casualties.

     11.3.4.4. Evaluate and treat patients with various burn injuries, including those
     associated with radiation exposure, blister agent exposure, and thermal burns.

     11.3.4.5. Provide emergency treatment of cardiovascular and respiratory compromise or
     arrest.

     11.3.4.6. Evaluate and treat combined injury (CBRN plus trauma) casualties.

        11.3.4.7. Recognize the importance of prophylactic interventions that may be affected by
        treatment regimens.

        11.3.4.8. Assist in implementing medical monitoring protocols and any special medical
        procedures for victims, responders, and medical personnel because of CBRN agents
        found at the scene.

     11.3.5. Patient Transportation. Decontaminated casualties will be transported from the
     scene after stabilization to designated, fixed-site receiving facilities. Note: Do not transport
     or handle contaminated patients.

        11.3.5.1. Transportation and initial distribution of CBRN casualties should be
        coordinated through existing installation ambulance services or through a community
        supported EMS system defined in an MAA, MOA, MOU, or contract.

        11.3.5.2. A patient administration team member will serve as the scene medical regulator
        and be responsible for reporting patient status and movement back to the MCC for
        tracking.

        11.3.5.3. Make every effort to prevent contamination of the ambulances and EMS
        responders. Although risks are minimal from residual contamination, the following
        precautions are advised during transport:

            11.3.5.3.1. All personnel accompanying victims should follow universal precautions,
            including the use of gloves, approved masks, and long-sleeved shirts.

            11.3.5.3.2. If feasible, return the patient to the decontamination cleaning area for
            additional cleaning. If not feasible, do the following to minimize the spread of
            contamination:

                11.3.5.3.2.1. Set the rear vent fan to high, and set the heating and cooling system
                to fresh air (not recirculated) to increase fresh-air exchanges and prevent the
                build-up of vapors.

                11.3.5.3.2.2. Verify all clothing and personal effects have been removed and
                sealed in disposable, double bags.

                11.3.5.3.2.3. Wrap the patient in a disposable tarp or blanket to prevent or
                minimize contaminating the inside of the vehicle.

                11.3.5.3.2.4. Notify the receiving hospital that the incoming patient shows
                evidence of possible contamination so that patient decontamination procedures
                can be activated. This process includes decontamination of medical personnel.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                    99

   11.3.6. Evidence Preservation at the Scene. FRT personnel should follow established
   procedures for collecting, handling, bagging, securing, and identifying potential evidence,
   including casualty personal effects.

       11.3.6.1. The collection and security of potential evidence is not the primary mission
       during medical management of CBRN casualties. However, medical personnel must
       understand there may be instances where the collection, temporary security, and transfer
       of physical evidence to law enforcement are warranted. Medical supplies and equipment
       may also be scrutinized for evidence during the post-incident criminal investigation.

       11.3.6.2. Procedures must be developed for conveying information obtained from
       casualties that have potential forensic value to law enforcement officials. Release of
       information must comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
       (HIPAA).

   11.3.7. Handling of Deceased Human Remains. Mortuary affairs functions are not
   considered the responsibility of the FRT. However, the team may be tasked to assist in the
   initial handling and securing of human remains at the scene. Human remains should not be
   moved until cleared by law enforcement or forensic officials.

11.4. Manning. FRT personnel provide initial response to the scene and consist of emergency
room or aerospace medicine ambulance response personnel. Follow-on support is provided by
additional FRT members, Patient Admin Team or members of other MCRP teams . Requests for
additional support must flow from the incident site to the IC, then to the ESF #8 representatives
who will contact the MCC.

11.5. Integration. Medical unit response planning must include integration and coordination
with other medical unit MCRP teams and their respective 886 AS. This integration and
coordination must also correlate with the MCRP, DCP, and installation IEMP 10-2 to ensure a
seamless response with other installation agencies. Follow-on response capabilities from local,
state, tribal, and federal agencies should be identified, coordinated, and exercised before a CBRN
event.

   11.5.1. Horizontal Integration. The FRT integrates directly with the first responders at the
   incident site. However, they remain in a safe (cold) zone and take guidance from the senior
   medical representative through the IC. All interactions with other response organizations
   must be coordinated through the EOC. Except as authorized by the medical unit commander
   or the MCC team chief during response operations, there will be direct integration with local,
   state, tribal, and federal EMS and healthcare response resources at the incident site on the
   installation. If an off-installation response is required, the installation IEMP 10-2 provides
   Defense Support of Civilian Authorities (DSCA) guidance on actions that military
   commanders or responsible officials may take to save lives and prevent human suffering.

   11.5.2. Vertical Integration. All communications and requests for assistance or information
   by or to higher echelon or supporting Air Force or DOD commands, as well as local, state,
   tribal, or federal follow-on resources, should be coordinated through the EOC by the MCC.

   11.5.3. Additional Resources. The acquisition of additional services, equipment, and
   supplies in a CBRN event may be necessary when there is a depletion of the AS 886J. The
   POS, installation WRM caches (upon approval), and additional personnel needed to support
   the FRT mission should be acquired within the medical unit or through outside assistance
   (i.e., community EMS, NDMS, or healthcare facilities).

11.6. Equipment and Supplies. The FRT uses the assets on AS 886J. The materials in AS
886J provide universal protections and rapid response and treatment of gross injuries among
mass casualties. AS 886J includes the following sub-assemblages:

      •   Sub Assemblage AA–Admin
      •   Sub Assemblage I1–Infrastructure
      •   Sub Assemblage PA–Pharmacy reconstitution
      •   Sub Assemblage PT–Patient Treatment
      •   Sub Assemblage S1–Safety

      11.6.1. Pharmaceuticals. Pharmaceutical supplies in support of field response operations
      are maintained by the pharmacy team (AS 886E). The FRT and pharmacy team should
      develop practices to ensure delivery of required pharmaceutical supplies for on-scene field
      response operations.

      11.6.2. Customization. For pack-out purposes, AS 866J may be repackaged or configured
      to meet local needs. Resources may be added to the 886J package locally based upon
      specific local needs.

   11.6.3. Pre-Positioning. AS 886J equipment and supplies will be pre-positioned as
   determined by the FRT chief for optimal access in a disaster situation.

                                           TRIAGE

12.1. Introduction. This chapter provides procedures for medical unit triage capabilities. It
will assist medical unit planners in developing MCRP procedures to respond to a CBRN
incident, peacetime accident, or natural disaster and provide guidance on managing and
employing AS 886K. (See Chapter 16 for the ANG triage capabilities.)

   12.1.1. Triage Overview. Triage refers to the CBRN response capability provided by AS
   886K supplies. This capability must be integrated into the MCRP procedures and checklists.
   AS 886K supplies are intended to be used by existing triage teams. New MCRP teams
   should not be created to implement this capability.

       12.1.1.1. The triage team chief manages AS 886K and coordinates how the supplies
       should be packaged for rapid response. The team chief should coordinate with the
       pharmacy team chief on procedures for accessing and incorporating the pharmaceuticals
       from AS 886E into the triage team’s medical response bags.

       12.1.1.2. Triage response includes primary triage of self-presenters to the MTF before
       patient decontamination; evidence preservation at the medical decontamination zone; re-
       triage of decontaminated casualties; post-event prophylaxis dispensing; and
       documentation and reporting of asset status through MRDSS and DMLSS after the
       incident.

   12.1.2. Assumptions. The triage team must be able to respond and be functional at all times
   when the medical unit is open for patient care. They must be available for immediate recall
   after hours. Primary triage of CBRN casualties will be conducted at the ECP of the medical
   unit’s decontamination zone.

       12.1.2.1. All patients who present to the ECP will be re-assessed to determine whether
       they have been grossly decontaminated. Patients who are deemed not contaminated will
       be directed away from the decontamination zone through a clean lane and routed directly
       to secondary triage.

       12.1.2.2. Medical units will incorporate local procedures into their respective MCRPs.
       Plans should include specific setup procedures, setup diagrams, and team checklists.

       12.1.2.3. Historically, CBRN incidents result in a ratio of approximately 7:1 psychiatric
       casualties to casualties directly resulting from the incident. These patients need to be
       quickly identified and directed away from the warm zone so that they do not interfere
       with triage and treatment.

12.2. Capabilities and Limitations. The capabilities and limitations of the triage team will
vary depending on the number of patients presenting. AS 886K provides equipment and supplies
102                                                       AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

to triage up to 300 casualties. MAAs, MOAs, or MOUs may be in place to provide or enhance
triage capabilities. The team is divided into primary and secondary triage teams.

   12.2.1. Primary Triage Team. The primary triage team receives and triages self-presenters
   and casualties who are transported to the medical unit.

   12.2.2. Secondary Triage Team. The secondary triage team performs triage/re-triage of
   patients who have undergone patient decontamination procedures.

12.3. Concept of Operations. This concept of operations focuses on the triage team’s (primary
and secondary) ability to respond to a CBRN event using the equipment and supplies from AS
886K. Each medical unit must tailor its MCRP Basic Plan and applicable Annexes (D, N, etc.)
to incorporate the triage team AS 886K capability and support the IEMP 10-2.

   12.3.1. Activation. Immediate activation of MCRP teams is required to ensure a
   comprehensive and timely response. Medical units should incorporate team activation
   procedures into the MCRP and local checklists. Upon activation, the triage team responds to
   their rally point within the medical unit with their triage bags and appropriate PPE.

       12.3.1.1. When activated for response operations, the MCC assumes C2 of all MCRP
       teams operating within the medical unit.

       12.3.1.2. Medical units must incorporate procedures for tracking the accountability of all
       medical personnel responding to the event and establish reporting procedures through the
       MCC.

   12.3.2. Triage Methods. CBRN mass casualty triage differs from triage performed daily in
   the emergency care system because patients could potentially be contaminated. The type of
   triage system used should be formalized in the medical unit’s MCRP and installation IEMP
   10-2 and should support clinical teams in the medical unit and community healthcare
   facilities that may ultimately receive decontaminated and stabilized patients. The START
   algorithm (see Attachment 8), the JumpSTART Pediatric MCI triage algorithm (see
   Attachment 9) and Sort- Assess- Lifesaving Interventions- Triage/Treatment (SALT) Triage
   System (see Attachment 10) provide systematic methods for rapid assessment and
   categorization of casualties.

   12.3.3. Triage Operations. Triage personnel, in conjunction with the manpower/security
   team, may be the first to come into contact with a contaminated victim and are required to
   know the type, location, and proper use of available PPE. As with all PPE use, the potential
   for heat stress or exhaustion can be a serious limiting factor for team members. The team
   chief must encourage the consumption of fluids and rotate members before they succumb to
   the effects of heat stress. Consult AFMAN 10-2503 to determine heat stress factors.
   Communication with the patient and with other medical first receivers can be challenging
   while wearing the PAPR and hood. Use of hand signals, bull horns, and voice amplifiers can
   help overcome this limitation.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                  103

       12.3.3.1. The primary triage team should report to their assembly area inside the MTF
       and don the OSHA Level C PPE provided in AS 886K before reporting to the entrance of
       the patient decontamination zone. The team should establish a staging area within the
       medical unit’s decontamination zone (warm zone) for receiving and triaging patients.
       Primary triage should focus on the injuries as well as determination of whether casualties
       require decontamination or re-decontamination based on potential exposure. Because
       decontamination is a time limiting step in the treatment process, patients must be triaged
       and receive any needed lifesaving emergency medical treatment before decontamination.

       12.3.3.2. For patients who do not require decontamination, a clean lane will be
       established to route patients directly to the secondary triage area.

       12.3.3.3. Patients awaiting decontamination will be staged based on the triage category.
       The primary triage team triages casualties using the following categories: delayed,
       immediate, and minimal (DIM). Once ABC’s are established and the patient may be
       stable or still unstable, the patient will be directed to the appropriate decontamination
       lane (i.e., ambulatory or non-ambulatory) for processing through the patient
       decontamination tent.

       12.3.3.4. After decontamination, the secondary triage team re-triages patients based on
       their injury to include previous exposure. The secondary triage team should stage inside
       the medical unit or as close as possible to protect patients and first receivers from
       hypothermia and to shorten the distance that patients have to be transported. The team is
       not required to don Level C PPE to perform their duties. PPE is required to meet
       universal precautions, which may include but are not limited to patient exam gloves,
       gowns, protective eyewear, and protective masks, depending on the nature of the hazard.

   12.3.4. Radiological Dose Tracking. The triage team chief should coordinate with the
   installation radiation safety officer (IRSO) to develop procedures for radiological dose
   tracking for personnel working outdoors.

12.4. Manning. The primary and secondary triage teams should each be comprised of at least
one provider (physician, dentist, physician assistant, or IDMT) and one nurse or medical
technician.

12.5. Integration. Triage response planning must include integration and coordination with
other medical unit MCRP teams and their respective 886 AS. This integration and coordination
must also correlate with the MCRP, DCP, and installation IEMP 10-2 to ensure a seamless
response with other installation agencies. Follow-on response capabilities from local, state,
tribal, and federal agencies should be identified, coordinated, and exercised before a CBRN
event.

   12.5.1. Horizontal Integration. Triage planning should be coordinated with other medical
   unit teams responsible for decontaminating, treating, and stabilizing self-presenters at the
   medical unit or victims at the incident site. All interactions with other response organizations
   or work centers within the organizations must be coordinated through the MCC. Medical
104                                                       AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

   unit teams supporting this function are described in the MCRP and include clinical team
   personnel and available manpower/security personnel who provide patient movement support
   to the secondary triage team.

   12.5.2. Vertical Integration. All communications and requests for assistance or
   information by or to higher echelon or supporting Air Force or DOD commands, as well as
   local, state, tribal, or federal follow-on resources, should be coordinated through the EOC by
   the MCC. The triage team must not communicate directly with outside agencies without
   prior approval from the MCC.

   12.5.3. Additional Resources. The acquisition of additional services, equipment, and
   supplies during a CBRN event may be necessary if there is a depletion of AS 886K.
   Installation WRM caches (upon approval) and additional personnel needed to support the
   triage team mission should be acquired from the medical unit or through outside assistance
   (i.e., community EMS, NDMS, or healthcare facilities).

12.6. Equipment and Supplies. The triage team uses the materials on AS 886K. The materiel
in AS 886K supports triage of injuries among mass casualties. AS 886K includes the following
sub-assemblages:

   •   Sub Assemblage AA–Admin
   •   Sub Assemblage PA–Pharmacy
   •   Sub Assemblage PT–Patient Care Treatment
   •   Sub Assemblage S1–Safety

   12.6.1. Pharmaceutical Supplies. Pharmaceutical supplies in support of triage team
   operations are maintained by the pharmacy team.

   12.6.2. Customization. AS 886K can be packaged or configured to meet local needs.

   12.6.3. Pre-Positioning. AS 886K equipment and supplies should be pre-positioned as
   determined by the triage team chief for optimal access in a disaster situation.

   12.6.4. Personal Protective Equipment. AS 886K provides PPE for use by the primary
   triage team. PPE includes a loose-fitting (hooded) PAPR, DTAPS, chemical boots, chemical
   resistant glove liner, and gloves. Inspections of the hood and PAPR, to include flow check,
   are required every 30 days to maintain mission-ready status, and should be documented on
   AF Form 1071, Inspection/Maintenance Record. Note: PAPRs should be pre-assembled and
   stored in a ready status. Monthly flow checks should be performed to ensure they are
   operational, and PAPR batteries should be kept charged at all times.

                                           Chapter 13

                           CLINICAL AND NURSING SERVICES

13.1. Introduction. This chapter provides procedures for clinical and nursing services
capabilities. It will assist medical unit planners in developing MCRP procedures to respond to a
CBRN incident, peacetime accident, or natural disaster and provides guidance on managing and
employing AS 886L and AS 886D.

   13.1.1. Clinical Response Overview. Clinical response refers to the CBRN response
   capability provided by AS 886L supplies. This capability must be integrated into the MCRP
   clinical team’s procedures and checklists. AS 886L supplies are intended to be used by
   existing MCRP teams. New MCRP teams should not be created to implement this capability.

       13.1.1.1. The clinical MCRP team chief manages AS 886L and coordinates the
       organization of supplies for optimum treatment of medical casualties.

       13.1.1.2. Clinical response includes treatment of CBRN casualties; evidence preservation
       at the medical unit; treatment of decontaminated casualties arriving at receiving medical
       units; clinical sample collection; disposition of casualties after emergency treatment
       (including fatality management); assisting in coordination with civilian treatment
       facilities on patient-specific clinical information; hospitalization of victims or disposition
       to self- or home-care; preparation for medical evacuation; crisis and military community
       counseling; assistance in mass, pre- and post-event prophylaxis dispensing or
       vaccination; and documentation and reporting of asset status through MRDSS and
       DMLSS after the incident.

   13.1.2. Nursing Services Augmentation. The nursing services capability is a cache of
   medical supplies (AS 886D) to augment the medical supplies on AS 886L. AS 886D is only
   used at medical units with an inpatient capability. Most of this chapter addresses specific
   procedures for response with AS 886L, but these procedures also apply to AS 886D for
   inpatient facility settings.

   13.1.3. Assumptions. The clinical team must be able to respond and be functional at all
   times when the medical unit is open for patient care and must be available for immediate
   recall after hours. Planning is based on the following assumptions:

       13.1.3.1. Treatment of CBRN casualties may need to be conducted within the parent
       medical unit, at remote fixed sites, or at other out-of-hospital locations. Note: For
       simplicity, procedures described in this chapter assume treatment is being conducted in
       the medical unit.

       13.1.3.2. Medical unit capabilities vary and different scenarios may have different health
       and medical requirements. Therefore, each medical unit may employ AS 886L with the
       flexibility it requires based on available MCRP teams, local response concepts, and
       disaster plans.
106                                                          AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013



         13.1.3.3. Clinical teams will receive patients after they have been decontaminated and
         re-triaged.

   13.1.4. Background. CBRN incidents may result in an overwhelming number of casualties,
   well beyond the capacity of the civilian and military community healthcare system. Victim
   exposures will range from severe to mild (possibly only psychosomatic). Victims suffering
   severe exposure may collapse at the incident scene, while victims with mild exposure may
   depart the scene and seek medical attention immediately or later in the course of incidents.
   The degree of treatment provided to casualties of a CBRN event depend on a number of
   variables, including the agent employed, number of casualties requiring treatment, capacity
   of the medical unit (manning, material, and bed space), and availability of and access to other
   sources of care. AS 886L supplies are packaged in treatment bags and stored for use in an
   easily accessed storage location for use by the clinical teams.

13.2. Capabilities and Limitations. The clinical team is capable of providing basic medical
treatment in support of a CBRN event. AS 886L provides equipment and supplies to support the
treatment of 300 casualties. Capabilities include disaster medicine and treatment of casualties.
The clinical team provides treatment and stabilization to casualties within the medical unit or at
an alternate medical unit. MAAs, MOAs, or MOUs may be in place to provide or enhance AS
886L capabilities. (Not applicable to AFRC medical units.)

      13.2.1. Resources. The clinical team is normally divided into minimal, immediate, and
      delayed teams. To minimize the impact on resources, smaller units with limited manpower
      may organize their personnel into one team rather than dividing the team.

         13.2.1.1. Expectant patients normally are those patients who are hopelessly injured or
         who require inordinate medical treatment to the detriment or neglect of other patients. As
         a rule, this category is not applied in a peacetime disaster, unless the facility is totally
         overwhelmed with casualties.

         13.2.1.2. During facility lockdown, the team may have to provide care to pre-incident
         patients in the medical unit. These patients may be considered as a manning resource.

      13.2.2. PPE. This team does not use specialized CBRN PPE in the execution of their duties.
      PPE is generally restricted to universal precautions, which may include patient exam gloves
      and surgical masks depending on the nature of the hazard involved. Note: During infectious
      disease outbreaks, N95 masks will be issued from the SG05 package to all patient care
      personnel.

13.3. Concept of Operations. This concept of operations focuses on the clinical team’s ability
to treat casualties resulting from a CBRN mass casualty event using the equipment and supplies
in AS 886L. Each medical unit must tailor its MCRP Basic Plan and applicable annexes to
incorporate the clinical AS 886L capability and support the IEMP 10-2.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                  107

  13.3.1. Activation. Medical unit response is normally activated through the installation
  ECC/dispatch. Immediate activation of MCRP teams is required to ensure a comprehensive
  and timely response.

     13.3.1.1. Upon notification of a suspected mass casualty event, the medical unit
     commander, MCC, or emergency room activates the clinical team IAW the MCRP.

     13.3.1.2. MCRP teams should be notified immediately by the MCC of any change in
     FPCON that may affect the response.

     13.3.1.3. Upon activation, the clinical team responds to the pre-designated rally point
     with their response bags, equipment, and supplies from AS 886L.

     13.3.1.4. The primary triage and manpower/security teams respond outside the medical
     unit to support the patient decontamination team, donning OSHA Level C PPE.

     13.3.1.5. The secondary triage team stages just inside the medical unit to receive and re-
     triage patients who have been decontaminated by the patient decontamination team.

     13.3.1.6. If activated for response operations, the MCC assumes C2 of the various
     MCRP teams within the medical unit and coordinates patient flow activities within the
     medical unit for the clinical team.

  13.3.2. Clinical Teams. The clinical teams are responsible for emergency stabilization,
  treatment, and disposition of decontaminated and triaged victims in the emergency
  department or other treatment areas designated inside the medical unit.

     13.3.2.1. The minimal team organizes personnel and resources as the situation warrants
     to provide care for minimally injured patients at the medical unit with the intent of
     returning personnel to duty in the shortest amount of time possible.

     13.3.2.2. Patients whose triage category is immediate or delayed are stabilized and
     transferred to the appropriate patient treatment locations within the medical unit or
     prepared for transport to a definitive care facility in the local community.

     13.3.2.3. The immediate and delayed teams organize personnel and resources as the
     situation warrants to provide stabilization and treatment for patients affected by a CBRN
     event.

     13.3.2.4. If no inpatient capability exists at the medical unit, the patient administration
     team coordinates transport in conjunction with the MCC, ambulance services, or
     community EMS and local hospitals based on previously established MAAs, MOAs,
     MOUs, and contracts.
108                                                         AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

            13.3.2.5 For radiological contingencies, clinical teams must have procedures for
            documenting radiation exposures in medical records for patients and medical
            personnel.

            13.3..2.6 Documentation should include symptoms, time of onset of symptoms,
            location during exposure, amount of time exposed, and distance from the incident
            site. All assessments of no exposure should be captured in the medical record.

            13.3.2.7 Long-term medical surveillance is mandatory for all patients with an acute
            exposure of greater than 5 rems and for patients with suspected uptake of radioactive
            material (ingestion, inhalation, absorption).

            13.3.2.8. BEE and other experts should be consulted for patient dose estimates.


      13.3.3. Additional Medical Unit Support. The following MCRP teams support clinical
      operations.

         13.3.3.1. The laboratory MCRP team provides laboratory support for the clinical teams
         at the medical unit and may support clinical specimen collection, evidence preservation,
         and chain of custody procedures. Clinical specimen collection may be required during the
         course of evaluation and treatment of victims.

            13.3.3.1.1. Procedures for collecting, handling, and delivering samples to the clinical
            laboratory by the clinical teams should be developed and articulated in the MCRP.

            13.3.3.1.2. Clinical sample analysis for biowarfare agents is performed by the LBDT
            using AS 886I. (See Chapter 10.) If a clinical specimen requires packaging for
            shipment to other laboratories, the laboratory MCRP team or LBDT should follow
            developed procedures IAW IATA requirements for packaging and shipment of a
            biological specimen.

         13.3.3.2. The radiology team provides diagnostic imaging support for the clinical teams
         at the medical unit.

         13.3.3.3. The pharmacy team provides pharmaceutical support to the clinical teams using
         AS 886E. (See Chapter 8.)

         13.3.3.4. The nursing services team, where applicable, interfaces with the clinical teams
         if patients require admittance for further care.

            13.3.3.4.1. Immediately upon activation, the nursing services team determines the
            appropriate staffing of nurses and medical technicians to support mass casualties in
            response to a CBRN event.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                109

        13.3.3.4.2. The nursing services team should validate total physical beds available
        for occupancy versus total patient census through a bed management protocol.

        13.3.3.4.3. If AS 886D is needed to support operations, the nursing services team
        should notify medical logistics through the MCC.

     13.3.3.5. For medical units with inpatient capability supported with pre-existing assets,
     the surgery team handles all CBRN casualties requiring surgery that are referred from the
     clinical teams (i.e., seriously injured patients with a good chance of survival if immediate
     care and life support is received).

        13.3.3.5.1. The supply of stock items should be determined as soon as possible to
        ensure adequate supplies are available.

        13.3.3.5.2. If necessary, AS 886D assets should be requested from medical logistics
        and used.

     13.3.3.6. The crisis response team is responsible for providing mental health services.
     This team may provide care for responders, victims, families, and other persons affected
     by the incident inside or outside the medical unit.

     13.3.3.7. The manpower/security team supports the clinical teams with patient
     movement within the medical unit as well as from the medical unit to transport vehicles
     (i.e., ambulances, ambulance bus [AMBUS]). If vehicles are needed to perform these
     operations, this requirement should be coordinated with the medical VCO and the MCC.

     13.3.3.8. The patient administration team assists the clinical teams with tracking patients
     within the medical unit and at community healthcare facilities. They coordinate patient
     transport in conjunction with the MCC, ambulance services, or community EMS and
     local hospitals based on previously established MAAs, MOAs, MOUs, and contracts.
     Note: At the scene, the FRT or a regional coordinator may coordinate patient transport to
     local higher levels of care facilities.

     13.3.3.9. The PH team provides epidemiological surveillance, prevention and control
     measures, as well as investigations and reporting of biological incidents. They provide
     medical intelligence and coordinate with BEE on HRAs for the clinical teams during a
     CBRN event.

     13.3.3.10. The PHEO assists the BEE with the assessment of the clinical capability and
     the impact of a CBRN threat. The PHEO recommends appropriate actions to protect
     forces and serves as the medical POC for the treatment portions of the MCRP Annex N.

     13.3.3.11. The medical unit’s PA personnel coordinate risk communication plans with
     the PHEO, PH, crisis response team, and installation PA representatives before providing
     any information releases to the media. In the event of a biological event, the local health
110                                                      AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

      department should be consulted and included in the risk communications plan before any
      release of information to ensure a coordinated and consistent message is released.

   13.3.4. Evidence Preservation. During treatment operations, personnel may be required to
   implement established, standardized procedures for the collection, handling, bagging,
   securing, and identification of potential evidence, including casualty personal effects.

      13.3.4.1. The collection and security of potential evidence is not the primary mission
      during medical management of CBRN casualties. However, medical personnel must
      understand there may be instances where the collection, temporary security, and transfer
      of physical evidence to law enforcement are warranted. Medical supplies and equipment
      may be scrutinized for evidence during the post-incident criminal investigation.

      13.3.4.2. Procedures must be developed for conveying information obtained from
      casualties that have potential forensic value to law enforcement officials. Release of
      information must comply with HIPAA.

  13.3.5. Handling of Deceased Human Remains. Although mortuary affairs functions are
  not considered the responsibility of clinical teams in the medical unit, medical unit personnel
  may be tasked to assist in the handling and securing of human remains at the medical unit.
  Handling of human remains should be minimized until cleared by law enforcement or
  forensic officials.

  13.3.6. Triage. Triage is a continual process throughout the medical treatment regimen.
  The type of triage system used to support clinical teams in the medical unit as well as
  community healthcare facilities that may ultimately receive decontaminated and stabilized
  patients is formalized in the medical unit’s MCRP and installation IEMP 10-2. In a CBRN
  event, victims who self-present to the medical unit will first be directed through a primary
  triage area. The primary triage team is responsible for triaging victims before
  decontamination. See Chapter 12 for more information on triage operations.

  13.3.7. Casualty Care for Radiation Accident Victims. During all radiological incidents,
  consider all open wounds contaminated until proven otherwise. Assume embedded foreign
  bodies will produce an internal dose, and attempt to prevent or minimize further uptake of
  radioactive material into the body. Use the following procedures for treatment of
  contaminated wounds.

      13.3.7.1. Prepare a treatment room. Select a treatment room near an outside entrance,
      and clear the area of visitors and patients.

          13.3.7.1.1. Establish the treatment room as a controlled area with a demarcated
          control line to prevent the spread of contamination and a secondary control line or
          buffer zone as added security.

          13.3.7.1.2. Implement all established controlled area procedures (e.g., logging
          entrants). Consult the IRSO during planning to establish procedures.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                               111



        13.3.7.1..3. Remove or cover all equipment not required for emergency care.

        13.3.7.1.4. Cover the treatment room floor with wrapping or butcher paper and tape
        to make clean-up easier.

        13.3.7.1.5. Cover the treatment table with several layers of water-proof disposable
        plastic sheeting. Use waterproof materials such as a waterproof aperture drapes.

        13.3.7.1.6. Mark the exposed side of coverings with an “X” so the team knows which
        side should be rolled into the center.

        13.3.7.1.7. Document background radiation levels in the treatment room before
        patients enter. Consult with the IRSO to determine background levels.

     13.3.7.2. Begin patient treatment. Restrict access to all but the treatment team and
     patients.

        13.3.7.2.1. Attempt to determine the radionuclide involved. The radionuclide
        involved determines which medical interventions could help eliminate the material
        from the patient’s body (i.e., diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) or other
        chelating agent.)

            13.3.7.2.1.1. The IRSO may have detectors that could help with identification.

            13.3.7.2.1.2. Consult USAPHC TG 244 for technical information on medical
            treatments.

        13.3.7.2.2. Monitor all personnel and items leaving the treatment room to ensure
        contamination isn’t spread from the room to other areas of the MTF.

        13.3.7.2.3. Follow strict isolation precautions such as protective clothing and double
        bagging, use of plastic-lined containers for waste items (e.g., linens, dressings), and
        ventilation control.

        13.3.7.2.4. Delineate areas of gross bodily contamination and cover with plastic
        before surgery.

        13.3.7.2.5. Before surgical incision, wash the area with normal saline, betadine,
        and/or hydrogen peroxide.

        13.3.7.2.6. Change surgical instruments, outer gloves, and drapes when they become
        contaminated to avoid the spread of contamination.

        13.3.7.2.7. Use routine antisepsis procedures to protect operating room staff against
        contamination.

       13.3.7.3. Perform patient and room decontamination procedures.

           13.3.7.3.1. Consult the IRSO for equipment monitoring and wipe tests as well as
           control and disposal procedures for contaminated waste to include contaminated
           tissue removed from the victim.

           13.3.7.3.2. Personnel should be monitored for exposures before they leave the room.

               13.3.7.3.2.1. Hospital activities guidance is available on the U.S. Department of
               Health and Human Services REMM website at the following URL:
               http://www.remm.nlm.gov/hospitalprep.htm

               13.3.7.3.3.2. For more information on internal contaminant radio nuclides, see
               the Medical Management of Radiological Casualties Handbook, Appendix B,
               Table of Internal Contaminant Radionuclides, at the following URL:
               http://www.afrri.usuhs.mil/www/outreach/pdf/2edmmrchandbook.pdf

13.4. Manning. Clinical team personnel provide stabilization and treatment of casualties.
Additional manning is provided by uncommitted members of the MCRP manpower/security
team. The clinical team can be divided into minimal, delayed, and immediate teams, as needed.
Fielding of these teams may not apply at all medical units based on the size and capacity of the
medical unit and local capabilities supported by MAAs, MOAs, and MOUs.

   13.4.1. Minimal Team. This team treats patients with minor injuries who require some
   attention but whose injuries are so minor, they may not need a physician.

   13.4.2. Delayed Team. This team treats patients whose injuries do not jeopardize life if
   definitive treatment is delayed.

   13.4.3. Immediate Team. This team treats patients whose injuries demand immediate
   medical or surgical intervention to save their lives or limbs.

   13.4.4. Nursing Services Augmentation. At facilities assigned AS 886D, a nursing
   services team is established and responsible for maintenance and management of the AS.

13.5. Integration. Medical unit response planning must include integration and coordination
with other medical unit MCRP teams and their respective 886 AS. This integration and
coordination must also correlate with the installation IEMP 10-2 to ensure a seamless response
with other installation agencies. Follow-on response capabilities from local, state, tribal, and
federal agencies should be identified, coordinated, and exercised before a CBRN event.

   13.5.1. Coordination with Pharmacy. The clinical team chief should coordinate with the
   pharmacy team chief on procedures for accessing and incorporating the pharmaceuticals on
   AS 886E into the overall medical capability of AS 886L.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                   113

       13.5.1.1. If mass prophylaxis distribution is required, clinical team providers should
       support the pharmacy team chief with appropriate health screening before dispensing
       medications.

       13.5.1.2. If a pandemic outbreak occurs, the clinical team chief should coordinate
       distribution of SG05 and SG06 assets and request additional support as needed. The
       pharmacy team chief is responsible for coordination and distribution of SG06
       pharmaceuticals during a pandemic outbreak. The clinical team chief is responsible for
       the maintenance and management of the SG05 assets.

   13.5.2. Horizontal Integration. The clinical team is directly integrated into the medical
   unit’s response organization as delineated in the MCRP. All interactions with other response
   organizations should be coordinated through the MCC. The team may directly integrate with
   local, state, tribal, and federal EMS or healthcare response resources at the medical unit
   during response operations when authorized by the medical unit commander or MCC team
   chief or as defined in MAAs, MOAs, or MOUs.

   13.5.3. Vertical Integration. All communications and requests for assistance or
   information by or to higher echelon or supporting Air Force or DOD commands, as well as
   local, state, tribal, or federal follow-on resources, should be coordinated through the EOC by
   the MCC. The clinical team should not communicate directly with outside agencies without
   prior approval from the MCC.

   13.5.4. Additional Resources. The acquisition of additional services, equipment, and
   supplies during a CBRN event may be necessary if there is a depletion of AS 886L or the
   clinical treatment effort is overwhelmed. If AS 886L is depleted, AS 886D assets will be
   used for medical units with inpatient capabilities. WRM caches (upon approval) and
   additional personnel needed to support the clinical team mission should be acquired within
   the medical unit or through outside assistance (i.e., community EMS, NDMS, or healthcare
   facilities).

13.6. Equipment and Supplies. The clinical team uses the assets on AS 886L/D. AS 886L and
886D each contain medical equipment and supplies to treat 300 casualties. AS 886L includes
advanced medical supplies to augment existing medical unit caches in emergency stabilization
and treatment. AS 886D includes medical supplies to augment AS 886L for inpatient facilities
and does not contain any sub-assemblages. AS 886L contains the following sub-assemblages:

   •   Sub Assemblage AA–Admin
   •   Sub Assemblage I1–Infrastructure
   •   Sub Assemblage PA–Pharmacy
   •   Sub Assemblage PT–Patient Treatment
   •   Sub Assemblage S1–Safety

   13.6.1. Pharmaceutical Supplies. Pharmaceutical supplies in support of clinical operations
   are maintained by the pharmacy team.

   13.6.2. Customization. AS 866L may be repackaged or configured to meet local needs.

  13.6.3. Pre-Positioning. AS 886L equipment and supplies will be pre-positioned as
  determined by the clinical team chief for optimal access in a disaster situation. AS 886D
  equipment and supplies will be pre-positioned as determined by the nursing services team
  chief or other locally assigned team chief.

                                  MANPOWER/SECURITY

14.1. Introduction. This chapter provides procedures for medical unit manpower and security
capabilities. It will assist medical unit planners in developing MCRP procedures to respond to a
CBRN incident, peacetime accident, or natural disaster and provide guidance on the management
and employment of AS 886M. Note: The manpower and security functions have been
combined into a single team.

   14.1.1. Manpower/Security Overview. Medical unit manpower/security refers to the
   CBRN response capability provided by AS 886M. This capability must be integrated into
   the MCRP procedures and checklists. AS 886M supplies are intended to be used by an
   existing MCRP team. New MCRP teams should not be created to implement this capability.

       14.1.1.1. The manpower/security team coordinates how AS 886M supplies are stored
       and accessed to ensure an integrated, rapid response.

       14.1.1.2. Manpower/security team incident response activities include securing the
       medical unit when access is limited/controlled; providing security support for the patient
       decontamination team and mass prophylaxis dispensing locations; and documentation
       and reporting of asset status through MRDSS and DMLSS after the incident.

       14.1.1.3. The manpower/security decon support team is a subset of the
       manpower/security team and works in the hospital decontamination zone in support of
       the patient decontamination process.

   14.1.2. Assumptions. The manpower/security team must be able to respond and be
   functional at all times when the medical unit is open for patient care and must be available
   for immediate recall after hours. Planning factors are based on the following assumptions:

       14.1.2.1. The manpower/security decon support sub-team will be organized to support
       the medical unit patient decontamination warm zone. Duties include but are not limited
       to establishing an ECP and cordon and assisting with patient movement. They may also
       be required to assist in the patient decontamination shelter setup.

       14.1.2.2. Medical units will incorporate local procedures into their respective MCRP.
       The MCRP should include specific setup procedures, setup diagrams, and team
       checklists.

       14.1.2.3. Medical unit capabilities vary. Therefore, each medical unit may employ AS
       886M with the flexibility it requires based on available MCRP teams, local response
       concepts, and disaster plans.

       14.1.2.4. Manpower/security team support, to include the decon support sub-team, will
       be required at the medical unit only.
116                                                         AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013



         14.1.2.5. The manpower/security team may require additional support from SF if the
         incident becomes unmanageable.

14.2. Capabilities and Limitations. Capabilities and limitations of the manpower/security team
will vary depending on the type and location of the incident and the number of patients self-
presenting or being transported to the medical unit. MAAs, MOAs, or MOUs may be in place to
provide or enhance existing capabilities.

   14.2.1. Resources. The manpower/security team provides basic medical unit security and
   also provides manpower to move patients throughout the decontamination and triaging
   processes. AS 886M provides equipment and supplies to secure the medical unit and control
   vehicular access with the intent to provide crowd control for 300 casualties.

   14.2.2. PPE. Security and patient movement duties may take place in the patient
   decontamination warm zone in support of patient decontamination operations. The
   manpower/security team is equipped with and trained to use appropriate PPE for protection
   against CBRN hazards when performing manpower and security duties in the medical unit’s
   decontamination warm zone.

14.3. Concept of Operations. This concept of operations focuses on the manpower/security
team’s ability to provide medical unit security during a CBRN event using the equipment and
supplies in AS 886M. The manpower/security team provides facility security and the
manpower/security decon support sub-team provides support for the patient decontamination
process. Each medical unit must tailor its MCRP Basic Plan and applicable annexes (e.g., D, H,
I, J, M, N, P, Q) to incorporate the manpower/security team AS 886M capability and support the
IEMP 10-2.

      14.3.1. Activation. Immediate activation of the MCRP teams is required to ensure a
      comprehensive and timely response. Medical units should incorporate team activation
      procedures into the MCRP and local checklists.

         14.3.1.1. Upon notification of a CBRN event at the medical unit, simultaneous activation
         of the patient decontamination, clinical, triage, and manpower/security teams is needed to
         prevent contaminated casualties from degrading the medical unit’s ability to function.

         14.3.1.2. Upon activation, the manpower/security team meets at the designated rally
         point with the PPE bags from AS 886M. The team chief determines team assignments,
         specifically which personnel should respond outside the medical unit to support the
         decontamination zone with OSHA Level C PPE.

         14.3.1.3. When activated, the MCC assumes C2 of all MCRP teams operating within the
         medical unit. Medical units should incorporate procedures for tracking the accountability
         of all medical personnel responding to the event and establish reporting procedures
         through the MCC.

  14.3.2. Medical Unit Security. During an incident involving CBRN agents, the
  manpower/security team is responsible for providing security around the medical unit and
  securing the facility against potential contamination. The security team typically is
  responsible for restricting vehicular access to the area around the medical unit. Controlled
  access to the medical unit must be assured. Medical units must develop local plans to secure
  entries (manually or electronically) and if necessary post door guards during a CBRN
  incident.

     14.3.2.1. As soon as a CBRN incident is suspected or the medical unit receives
     notification of an actual event, entry doors must be immediately secured to keep
     contamination out and ensure that decontamination is performed before entry into the
     medical unit. In most instances, the manpower/security team is responsible for ensuring
     the facility’s exits and entrances are controlled, monitored, and locked. This function is
     normally performed within minutes of discovering the occurrence or notification of an
     event.

     14.3.2.2. During the process of securing the medical unit, manpower/security team
     personnel may have to exit the medical unit and manage potentially contaminated
     victims. Manpower/security personnel must know the location of and how to use
     appropriate PPE.

         14.3.2.2.1. As with all PPE use, the potential for heat stress or exhaustion can be a
         serious limiting factor for team members. The team chief must encourage the
         consumption of fluids and rotate members before they succumb to the effects of heat
         stress. Consult AFMAN 10-2503 to determine heat stress factors.

         14.3.2.2.2. Communication with the patient and with other medical first receivers can
         be challenging while wearing the PAPR and hood. Use of hand signals, bull horns,
         and voice amplifiers can help overcome this limitation.

     14.3.2.3. At the medical unit, the primary triage team and members of the
     manpower/security decon support sub-team respond and work in the vicinity of the
     patient decontamination area (considered an operational medical first receiver area). The
     manpower/security decon support sub-team is responsible for assembling and providing
     instructions to all self-presenting victims to prevent the possibility of bystander exposure
     to off gassing or residual CBRN agents.

         14.3.2.3.1. The manpower/security decon support team is responsible for providing
         crowd control to ensure that victims keep their distance from the triage and patient
         decontamination team members until these teams and their resources (e.g., decon
         shelter) are in place and ready for use.

         14.3.2.3.2. Victims who were decontaminated on-scene and transported to the
         medical unit may be directed to bypass the patient decontamination area and be re-
         triaged by the secondary triage team.

       14.3.2.4. AS 886M provides barriers for vehicle control. The quantity will vary based on
       the physical layout of each medical unit and the installation’s barrier plan. These barriers
       should be used to direct traffic around the medical unit and direct personnel toward the
       patient decontamination entrance.

       14.3.2.5. The manpower/security team chief should coordinate with the IRSO to develop
       radiological dose tracking procedures for personnel working outdoors.

14.4. Manning. The manpower/security team provides controlled access to the medical unit,
secures the perimeter of the medical unit, and provides crowd and traffic control to the medical
unit and patient decontamination area. Medical units can request through the MCC SF support to
assist with area security and crowd and vehicle control. However, SF personnel will likely be
engaged elsewhere during a CBRN terrorist event on the installation. The pool of trained
manpower/security team personnel must be large enough to field a team while accounting for
leave, TDYs, and the possibility that some personnel are not available or cannot be reached for
immediate response. Training requirements are outlined in AFI 41-106. Medical units should
train a number of manpower personnel in setting up the patient decontamination shelter to
augment or assist patient decontamination members as needed.

14.5. Integration. Medical unit response planning must include integration and coordination
with other medical unit MCRP teams and their respective 886 AS. This integration and
coordination must also correlate with the installation IEMP 10-2 to ensure a seamless response
with other installation agencies. Follow-on response capabilities from local, state, tribal, and
federal agencies must be identified, coordinated, and exercised before a CBRN event.

   14.5.1. Horizontal Integration. The manpower/security team will work with the SFS if the
   SFS responds to the medical unit for support. Normally, there is no other direct integration
   with other installation response organizations. The manpower/security team is directly
   integrated into the medical unit’s response organization as delineated in the MCRP. All
   interaction with other response organizations must be coordinated through the MCC.

   14.5.2. Vertical Integration. All communications and requests for assistance or
   information by or to higher echelon or supporting Air Force or DOD commands, as well as
   local, state, tribal, or federal follow-on resources, should be coordinated through the EOC by
   the MCC. The manpower/security team should not communicate directly with outside
   agencies without prior approval from the MCC.

   14.5.3. Additional Resources. The acquisition of additional services, equipment, and
   supplies during a CBRN event may be necessary if there is a depletion of AS 886M assets. If
   this occurs, POS and installation WRM caches (upon approval) should be used to support the
   medical response. Additional personnel may be necessary to support the manpower/security
   team. These additional resources may be requested through the MCC when it appears that
   the medical unit security effort is overwhelmed.

14.6. Equipment and Supplies. The manpower/security team uses the materials on AS 886M.
AS 886M assets may be packaged or configured to meet local needs. AS 886M includes the
following sub-assemblages:

   •   Sub Assemblage I1–Infrastructure
   •   Sub Assemblage PT–Patient Care/Treatment
   •   Sub Assemblage S1–Safety

   14.6.1. Pre-Positioning. AS 886M equipment and supplies are pre-positioned as
   determined by the team chief for optimal access in a disaster situation.

   14.6.2. PPE. AS 886M provides personal PPE for use by the manpower/security teams.
   PPE includes a loose-fitting (hooded) PAPR, DTAPS, chemical boots, chemical resistant
   glove liner, and gloves. Inspections of the hood and PAPR, to include flow check, are
   required every 30 days to maintain mission ready status, and should be documented on AF
   Form 1071, Inspection/Maintenance Record. Note: The PAPRs should be pre-assembled
   and in ready-to-go status, including monthly flow checks, to ensure they are operational.
   PAPR batteries should be kept charged at all times.

                                           Chapter 15

                                      PUBLIC HEALTH

15.1. Introduction. This chapter outlines the response procedures for the public health team
(PHT) before, during, and after a CBRN-related biological event. These procedures exist to limit
casualties and sustain mission capability at Air Force installations. This response plan applies to
all biological attacks against Air Force installations. PHT response also applies during
operationally significant, naturally occurring, emerging infectious disease outbreaks and
pandemics.

   15.1.1. PHT Overview. A CBRN incident will result in a surge in the requirement for PHT
   support activities at the scene of the event, at the installation’s medical unit, and other
   locations on the installation (e.g., shelters and food-serving facilities). Demands for PH
   response will depend on the type and magnitude of the incident, as well as the capabilities of
   the medical unit and installation.

       15.1.1.1. Each PHT must maintain, in ready status, the equipment and supplies required
       for initial response to a biological event, including specialized detection and surveillance
       equipment for investigating food-borne illness outbreaks, performing vector-borne
       disease surveillance, and identifying suspected biological agents. The PHT response is
       supported by AS 886P.

       15.1.1.2. PHT planning must include integration and coordination with local and state
       response agencies, as appropriate. The response to any emergency or disaster must be a
       coordinated community effort.

   15.1.2. Assumptions. PHT response plans are based on the following assumptions:

       15.1.2.1. A disease outbreak or suspected illness may initially manifest itself at the
       medical facility with patients showing unexpected symptoms or a higher than average
       number of patients seeking medical assistance.

       15.1.2.2. Due to the varying incubation periods of biological organisms, exposure may
       precede the onset of illness by days or weeks, depending on the causative agent.
       Biological toxins are an exception because symptoms will generally manifest within
       hours of exposure.

       15.1.2.3. Initially, an infectious disease outbreak caused by enemy or terrorist attack may
       be indistinguishable from a naturally occurring disease outbreak. Several days may pass
       before medical authorities suspect a deliberate cause.

       15.1.2.4. Because of the rapid progression to illness and potential for dissemination of
       some biological agents, it may not be practical to wait for complete information. The
       wing commander, PHEO, public health, and medical personnel may have to take action
       based upon incomplete information.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                      121



         15.1.2.4.1. It may be necessary to initiate a response based on the recognition of
         high-risk syndromes. Initial response should provide protection against all potential
         modes of transmission until the causative mode is identified.

         15.1.2.4.2. Assume all disease outbreaks are contagious until the causative agent and
         mode of transmission are identified.

     15.1.2.5. Medical interventions (vaccination or prophylaxis) and limiting exposure
     (social distancing and protection) are considered most effective if implemented before or
     at the onset of the event.

     15.1.2.6. To properly respond to a CBRN threat or emergency, PH must complete
     essential preparedness activities.

         15.1.2.6.1. Disease outbreaks will require an integrated response from multiple
         organizations across the base as well as local, state, federal, international, and host
         nation authorities. Establish close working relationships and open communication
         with the following:

         •   State, regional, and tribal public health agencies
         •   Academic institutions
         •   EMS
         •   LEPCs
         •   Emergency management agencies (EMAs)
         •   Law enforcement

         15.1.2.6.2. Responses to disease outbreaks suspected of being deliberate in origin
         require special law enforcement procedures (e.g., establishing and maintaining a
         chain of custody for all clinical or environmental samples submitted and transported
         for laboratory testing).

         15.1.2.6.3. PHT members are expected to participate in hazard and risk assessments
         for the local area.

  15.1.3. Background. Acts of bioterrorism and emerging infectious diseases have become
  more prevalent across Air Force installations worldwide. With the increased frequency of
  deployments and movement of troops within and outside the United States, the introduction
  and spread of infectious disease is more likely. Increased engagement in efforts to improve
  disease surveillance and outbreak response will help detect new or unusual diseases and
  improve response to health emergencies, which include naturally occurring and intentionally
  caused outbreaks.

     15.1.3.1. A bioterrorism attack is the deliberate release of viruses, bacteria, or other
     germs (agents) to cause illness or death in people, animals, or plants. These agents are
     typically found in nature, but they may be altered to increase virulence, pathogenicity, or
122                                                       AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

      antibiotic resistance. Biological agents can be spread through the air, water, or ingested
      food.

      15.1.3.2. Bioterrorism agents are classified according to public health risk. Category A
      agents pose the greatest risk to public health and may result in mass casualties. They
      require surveillance, rapid detection, and stockpiling of medications. Currently, the CDC
      recognizes six Category A agents. Category B and C agents have the potential to cause
      illness but pose a lower medical and public health impact.
      http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/agentlist-category.asp#a

      15.1.3.3. Terrorists may use biological agents because they can be extremely difficult to
      detect and do not cause illness for several hours to several days. Bioterrorism may occur
      as covert incidents, in which persons are unknowingly exposed and an outbreak is
      suspected only upon recognition of unusual disease clusters or symptoms. Bioterrorism
      may also occur as announced events to cause panic in the population, in which persons
      are warned that an exposure has occurred. In the event of a terrorism incident, in
      particular covert terrorist attacks, early detection and control of its consequences may be
      the observant physician, veterinarian, laboratory technician, public health technician or
      other medical professional who recognizes an unusual illness or cluster of illnesses or
      increases in requests for medical services or a specific diagnosis.

      15.1.3.4. In an age of expanding air travel and international trade, infectious microbes
      are transported across borders every day. They are carried by infected people, animals,
      and insects and contained within commercial shipments of contaminated food. Old
      diseases such as malaria, measles, and foodborne illnesses are endemic in many parts of
      the globe, and new diseases such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome as well as new
      forms of old diseases such as multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) can emerge in one
      region and spread throughout the world. Unforeseen disease problems can be expected.
      Recent examples include vancomycin-resistant infections of Staphylococcus aureus,
      avian influenza, and Nipah virus encephalitis. Left unchecked, today’s emerging diseases
      could become the endemic diseases of tomorrow.

      15.1.3.5. A severe pandemic in a fully susceptible population, such as the 1918
      pandemic, or one of even greater severity with limited quantities of antiviral medications
      and pre-pandemic vaccine represents a worst-case scenario. A severe pandemic could
      overwhelm the healthcare system and challenge the ability to complete the Air Force
      mission. Conventional strategy for pandemic influenza is to limit the spread of a
      pandemic; mitigate disease, suffering and death; and sustain infrastructure and lessen the
      impact on the mission. Without mitigating interventions, even a less severe pandemic
      would likely result in dramatic increases in the number of hospitalizations and deaths.

      15.1.3.6. The primary responses for combating influenza are vaccination, treatment of
      infected individuals and prophylaxis of exposed individuals with influenza antiviral
      medications, and implementation of infection control and social distancing measures.
      The single most effective intervention is vaccination. However, it is highly unlikely that
      a well-matched vaccine will be available when a pandemic begins unless a vaccine with
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                   123

       broad cross-protection is developed. With current vaccine technology, pandemic strain
       vaccine would not be available for at least four to six months after the start of a
       pandemic. Once an effective pandemic vaccine is developed, it is likely that amounts
       will be limited due to the production process and will not be sufficient to cover the entire
       population. The public health community must be prepared to face the first wave of the
       next pandemic without vaccine—the best countermeasure—and potentially without
       sufficient quantities of influenza antiviral medications. It is not known if influenza
       antiviral medications will be effective against a future pandemic strain. The actual
       effectiveness of individual infection control measures (e.g., cough etiquette, hand
       hygiene) and the role of surgical masks or respirators in preventing the transmission of
       influenza are currently unknown. However, cough etiquette and hand hygiene is
       universally recommended, and the use of surgical masks and respirators may be
       appropriate in certain settings.

15.2. Capabilities and Limitations. The PHT provides the MTF with the capability to detect
and respond to a biological event. PH provides commanders with medical intelligence,
surveillance, and disease control measures. The PHT is trained to perform the following
functions:

   15.2.1. Consultation. Brief commanders and personnel on pertinent medical intelligence
   considerations and countermeasures. Include information on endemic disease threats,
   outbreaks, and CBRN warfare agents and their associated health effects.

   15.2.2. Risk Assessment and Analysis. Monitor, investigate, and report syndromes,
   illnesses, and other conditions of military medical importance. Report all suspicious disease
   rates, types, or trends that suggest a public health emergency to appropriate authorities.

       15.2.2.1. Prepare appropriate risk communication messages as required.

       15.2.2.2. Investigate communicable/infectious disease outbreaks (or clusters) to
       determine the cause and prevent further cases or future outbreaks. Perform
       epidemiological analyses to include verification on the diagnosis and outbreak, case
       definition, descriptive epidemiology, identification of exposure sources and risk factors,
       statistical comparisons, and implementation of prevention and control measures.

       15.2.2.3. Conduct epidemiological analysis of disease data and make recommendations to
       the PHEO and MTF commander on prevention and control measures. Coordinate
       prevention activities with pharmacy, immunization, and all other necessary personnel.

       15.2.2.4. Provide support to the PHEO during public health emergencies and installation
       contingency responses. Ensure the PHEO is notified promptly about cases or disease
       rates that suggest a public health emergency.

       15.2.2.5. Investigate all public health emergency cases for sources of infection/exposure.
124                                                       AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

      15.2.2.6. Assess health risks and provide recommendations on appropriate disease
      containment measures associated with suspected exposure (e.g., PPE, quarantine,
      isolation).

      15.2.2.7. Report investigation results with recommended preventive measures to the
      PHEO, squadron commander, MDG commander, wing commander, MAJCOM/SG,
      PHO, USAFSAM, and local and state health departments as required.

   15.2.3. Disease Surveillance, Prevention, Control, and Reporting. Perform zoonotic and
   vector-borne disease surveillance, prevention, control, and reporting.

      15.2.3.1. Conduct surveillance activities with appropriate vector trapping and develop a
      local vector profile assessment.

      15.2.3.2. Maintain communication with providers to ensure prompt reporting of vector-
      borne disease. Communicate with state and local public health authorities to identify
      potential zoonotic and vector-borne outbreaks and disease vectors of medical importance
      in the local area.

      15.2.3.3. Collect routine vector samples as needed to maintain a local vector profile and
      package and ship specimens to the appropriate entomology laboratory.

      15.2.3.4. In response to a suspected or confirmed vector-borne outbreak, collect vector
      samples in support of public health response activities. Coordinate with the lab team
      (886I) for available JBAIDS vector-borne assays or package and ship specimens to the
      appropriate entomology laboratory.

      15.2.3.5. Communicate vector surveillance results with CE pest management and assess
      control measures implemented by CE pest management.

  15.2.4. Response to Food-Borne Illness Outbreaks. During a food-borne illness outbreak,
  determine the possible source of the infection and report findings.

      15.2.4.1. Interview patients to determine possible sources of infection. Inspect facilities
      to determine possible environmental sources of infection.

      15.2.4.2. Collect food samples and package and ship specimens to the appropriate testing
      laboratory. Coordinate as necessary with the lab team (886I) for available JBAIDS food-
      borne assays.

      15.2.4.3. Inspect all potentially contaminated food for wholesomeness and make
      appropriate recommendations on priority use, proper decontamination procedures, and
      fitness for human consumption. Accomplish food decontamination IAW FM 4-
      02.7/MCRP 4-11.1F/NTTP 4-02.7/AFTTP 3-42.3, Appendix J.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                    125

       15.2.4.4. Train and provide consultative services to food facility managers concerning
       wholesomeness condition, packaging integrity, source approval, food security, sanitary
       condition of delivery vehicles, and proper storage of foods at delivery to ensure
       suitability for intended purposes.

       15.2.4.5. Report investigation results with recommended preventive measures to the
       PHEO, squadron commander, MDG commander, wing commander, MAJCOM/SG,
       PHO, USAFSAM, and local and state health departments as required.

15.3. Concept of Operations. The PHT will be activated upon notification of a suspected
intentional biological incident by the MCC or local or state health department, as required by
HHQ guidance or as required by pertinent intelligence data relating to local health threats and
endemic diseases. Each clinic has the potential to be the first location to recognize and initiate a
response to a bioterrorism-related or natural disease outbreak. In this case, the MCC will
activate the PHT after notification from local MTF providers of a suspected biological incident
or natural infectious disease outbreak. The team can respond off-installation only at the
discretion of the installation commander, HHQ, or IAW local MAAs, MOAs, or MOUs.

   15.3.1. Outbreak Detection. Detection or identification of a food-borne illness,
   communicable disease, or vector-borne disease can occur through any of the following
   avenues.

       15.3.1.1. Routine public health surveillance. Using routine surveillance data, PHTs
       should know how many illnesses to expect in a given time period. If a larger number of
       people than expected appear to have the same illness with something in common to
       explain why they became ill, this may be considered an outbreak.

       15.3.1.2. Informal reports from individuals directly to the PHT.

       15.3.1.3. Formal reports from healthcare providers when they suspect conditions on the
       tri-service or state reportable condition list.

       15.3.1.4. Laboratory confirmation from a submitted patient sample.

       15.3.1.5. Direct report from a group about the intentional contamination of a food
       supply.

   15.3.2. Food-Borne Illness Investigations. PHTs responding to an unintentional food-
   borne illness outbreak should conduct an environmental assessment of all involved food
   facilities. At a minimum, the assessment should consist of interviews with individuals who
   prepared the food (to find out the ingredients used, the steps followed in preparing the food,
   and the temperatures used to prepare and hold the food), assessment of the health practices
   and training of the workers, cleanliness of the kitchen, health status of the workers at the time
   the exposures took place, and past inspection reports to see if there has been a history of
   problems. Local or state environmental health specialists should be contacted for any off-
   base food facilities involved in an outbreak investigation.
126                                                          AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013



         15.3.2.1. The PHT should conduct investigations using the food-borne illness testing
         equipment in AS 886P.

         15.3.2.2. During unintentional food-borne illness outbreaks, the PHT should collect
         samples of any epidemiologically implicated food items.

             15.3.2.2.1. If available, submit samples of the implicated food items that were not
             prepared or served (same brand/lot number, etc., as the implicated items consumed).

             15.3.2.2.2. Before collecting and submitting samples, contact the local laboratory
             response team or DOD Veterinary Food Analysis and Diagnostic Laboratory for
             instructions on the proper collection, holding, and shipping procedures.

             15.3.2.2.3. Review the DOD Veterinary Food Analysis and Diagnostic Laboratory
             Lab Sample Submission Guide to determine chain of custody requirements. This
             guide is available at the following URL:
             http://www.vetlab.army.mil/documents/fsts_docs.html

         15.3.2.3. In general, during intentional biological incidents, samples suspected of
         containing a BTA should be coordinated with the FBI through the AFOSI.

             15.3.2.3.1. Review the DOD Veterinary Food Analysis and Diagnostic Laboratory
             Lab Sample Submission Guide to ensure proper procedures are followed when
             collecting and submitting samples.

             15.3.2.3.2. If the PHT collects samples involved in a criminal investigation, PHT
             must follow strict chain of custody procedures when collecting implicated samples.

         15.3.2.4. Sample analysis is the responsibility of the receiving laboratory. However, the
         PHT may conduct basic sample analysis using the high microbial load (HML) kit. The
         HML kit can rapidly detect disease-causing organisms. The presence of high levels of
         unknown bacterial contaminants can signify spoilage or contamination of a suspected
         food. The HML kit will not detect biological toxins, chemical agents, pathogenic
         protozoa, or viruses.

      15.3.3. Communicable Disease Outbreaks. The PHT responds to a communicable disease
      outbreak using the epidemiology assets in AS 886P. Response procedures during a natural or
      intentional biological incident will vary depending on the capability of each MTF. Most
      small ambulatory facilities will notify a local community emergency network and transfer
      affected patients to appropriate facilities. Larger MTFs may activate isolation facilities. The
      PHT chief should refer to the local MCRP/DCP for specific guidance on response procedures
      for a natural or intentional communicable illness outbreak. All facilities should consider the
      following response actions during a communicable disease outbreak:

         15.3.3.1. Triage and isolation procedures.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 127



     15.3.3.2 Healthcare worker PPE.

     15.3.3.3. Collection and submission of confirmatory samples as required.

     15.3.3.4. Cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization of equipment and the environment.
     (See the MTF’s infection control OI.)

     15.3.3.5. Patient transport requirements. (See the installation’s DCP.)

     15.3.3.6. Discharge management.

     15.3.3.7. Post-mortem care. (See the installation’s DCP.)

     15.3.3.8. Pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure immunization.

     15.3.3.9. Patient, visitor, and public information (in conjunction with the wing and MDG
     PAO).

     15.3.3.10. Contact investigation.

     15.3.3.11. Rapid identification and isolation of affected patients. (See the installation’s
     DCP.)

     15.3.3.12. Interaction with local community healthcare facilities and health departments.
     (See any applicable MAAs, MOAs, or MOUs).

  15.3.4. Vector-Borne Disease Outbreaks. PHT members responding to a vector-borne
  disease outbreak should use all required PPE. AS 886P includes equipment and supplies for
  vector-borne response.

     15.3.4.1. During unintentional vector-borne disease outbreaks, PHT should collect,
     prepare, and submit samples using Air Force standards or IAW specific instructions from
     HHQ. Guidance for sample collection, preparation, and submission procedures is
     available online on the DOD Worldwide Influenza Surveillance Program website at the
     following URL: https://gumbo2.wpafb.af.mil/epi-consult/

     15.3.4.2. During intentional biological incidents, samples suspected of containing a BTA
     should be coordinated with the FBI through the AFOSI. Strict chain of custody
     procedures must be followed when submitting implicated vectors.

     15.3.4.3. In general, PHT members are not responsible for vector identification. Vector
     identification is accomplished through USAFSAM’s entomology department. Depending
     on circumstances, PHT members may be required to perform local vector identification
     during a vector-borne outbreak. Consult with the USAFSAM entomology department for
     guidance.
128                                                          AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013



   15.3.5. General Response Guidelines. PHT members should perform the following actions
   during an actual or suspected outbreak:

         15.3.5.1. As the situation dictates, increase active surveillance for the disease of concern.
         Report results to the MCC.

         15.3.5.2. Collect necessary samples and submit to appropriate testing laboratories.

         15.3.5.3. Perform all necessary contact investigations to stop the spread of disease.

         15.3.5.4. Advise the MCC of immediate health hazards and protective measures to
         implement.

         15.3.5.5. Integrate efforts with local MCRP response teams, as well as federal, state, and
         local responders.

         15.3.5.6. Don all required PPE.

      15.3.6. Biological Incidents with Prior Warning. Upon receipt of a warning, activate the
      PHT and start pre-event actions IAW the local MCRP. Pre-event actions include the
      following:

         15.3.6.1. Establish communication with the TWG, MCC, PHEO, infection control
         officer, laboratory response team, pharmacy team, immunizations personnel, clinical
         team, and other MCRP teams as necessary.

         15.3.6.2. Confirm communication with the local or state health department, local
         emergency department, FBI, HHQ, USAFSAM, and other agencies as necessary.

         15.3.6.3. Verify completion of active, passive, and syndromic surveillance activities. As
         required, enhance zoonotic and vector-borne disease surveillance activities, and initiate
         appropriate sampling of food products.

         15.3.6.4. Educate healthcare providers on typical clinical features of the illness and
         reporting procedures.

         15.3.6.5. Educate the base population on prevention measures, clinical features of the
         illness, and procedures to follow in case of suspected illness.

         15.3.6.6. Review the installation’s DCP.

         15.3.6.7. As applicable, review local MAAs, MOAs, or MOUs to verify agreements with
         the local medical community regarding patient handling.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 129

       15.3.6.8. Begin collecting and analyzing data as it becomes available through established
       health surveillance systems and laboratories, and evaluate any real-time sampling data.
       Communicate results to appropriate personnel in a timely manner through established
       operations plans, procedures, or local guidelines.

   15.3.7. Biological Incidents without Prior Warning. For biological incidents that occur
   without warning, the PHT should accomplish the same pre-event actions as an incident with
   warning and do the following:

       15.3.7.1. Compare projected requirements with available resources, and report
       deficiencies to the MCC.

       15.3.7.2. Deliver support as directed by the MCC.

15.4. Manning. The PHT consists of all fully qualified PHOs (43HX0) and public health
technicians (4EX0) assigned to the MTF’s public health response team. As the situation or
FPCON dictates, ensure at least one PHT member is available for immediate recall. This
individual should be a fully qualified and trained 5-level PH technician or higher.

   15.4.1. Augmentation. Additional manning support should be requested through the MCC
   IAW local policy (e.g. MCRP).

   15.4.2. PHT Chief Responsibilities. The PHT chief is responsible for the following
   functions:

       15.4.2.1. Ensure PHT orientation and training of all assigned PHT personnel, including
       augmentees.

       15.4.2.2. Ensure AS 886P equipment and supply inventories are maintained.

       15.4.2.3. Train and exercise on AS 886P equipment at least annually. AS 886P
       equipment training supports the annual DCP exercise required by AFI 41-106.

          15.4.2.3.1. The disease-containment strategy portion of the DCP exercise must test
          and evaluate the MTF’s ability to implement disease containment strategies in
          support of mission sustainment and patient care requirements.

          15.4.2.3.2. The exercise must test restriction of movement measures (e.g. social
          distancing, isolation, or quarantine), conducting epidemiological investigations, and
          declaring a public health emergency.

       15.4.2.4. Participate in the planning, design, and conduct of exercises to evaluate public
       health preparedness and response.
130                                                        AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

       15.4.2.5. Participate in after-action reviews of exercises and actual incidents to identify
       areas that require revision, enhancement, or training, and take appropriate follow-up
       action.

       15.4.2.6. Ensure augmentees receive the required oversight and JIT training necessary
       for safe completion of their assigned public health duties IAW local policy (e.g. MCRP).

15.5. Integration. PHT response must include integration and coordination with other
organizations that have initial and follow-on response requirements, including local, state, and
federal agencies. PHT planning should be coordinated with the following medical response
teams for biological incident response:

   15.5.1. Pharmaeutical Team Interaction. The pharmaceutical team ensures an adequate
   supply of the pharmaceutical supplies needed to support a biological incident. During
   periods of widespread disease transmission, the pharmaceutical team may be required to
   establish a point of dispensing for mass distribution of immunizations and medications. PH
   should provide briefings as required. AS 886P provides equipment to support the PHT
   during mass prophylaxis and point of distribution operations.

   15.5.2. Clinical Team Interaction. The clinical team is responsible for the treatment of
   biological casualties. The clinical team chief also manages AS 886L and coordinates the
   organization of supplies for optimum treatment of biological casualties. The PHT provides
   any required guidance on recognizing biological casualties, provides appropriate personal
   protective measures for medical personnel, and performs contact investigations to limit the
   spread of infection.

   15.5.3. BEE Team Interaction. The BEE team identifies, analyzes, and recommends
   control measures during a CBRN incident. PHT coordinates with the BEE team chief to
   provide collaborative expertise to installation commanders on the effects of biological agents.

   15.5.4. LBDT Interaction. The LBDT provides rapid pathogen identification during a
   biological incident. PHT coordinates with the LBDT on sample collection procedures. Once
   a biological agent is identified, the LBDT will notify the PHT.

   15.5.5. Interaction with Other Medical CBRN Response Teams. The PHT coordinates
   with other medical CRBN response teams as necessary. The PHT must exercise the
   established disease containment strategy in conjunction with other MTF MC-CBRN teams
   IAW AFI 41-106.

   15.5.6. Interaction with Civilian Response Resources. A CBRN event that occurs on an
   installation may require assistance from off-installation responders. The PHT must
   understand what local resources exist, their capabilities, and how and where to interface with
   civilian counterparts. Each installation should maintain MAAs, MOAs, or MOUs that
   outline military and civilian responsibilities during a CBRN incident. Examples of local
   civilian response resources include: local and state health departments, HAZMAT response
   teams, emergency planners, local inpatient hospitals, and acute care facilities.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                   131



       15.5.6.1. Imminently serious conditions resulting from an attack on civilian assets may
       require immediate action by the military to save lives, prevent human suffering, or
       mitigate significant property damage. Installation commanders may direct military
       resources to respond to off-installation incidents in such circumstances.

       15.5.6.2. A CBRN event that occurs on an installation may require assistance from off-
       installation responders due to limited resources available at some MTFs. The PHT must
       be familiar with local MAAs, MOAs, or MOUs to effectively interact with civilian
       counterparts.

       15.5.6.3. The PHT serves as the primary liaison with local, state, federal, territorial, and
       host nation public health officials. Maintain close contact and coordination with health
       officials who track communicable diseases in the local community and who manage and
       respond to public health emergencies. Note: The PHT will facilitate the PHEO’s role of
       communicating with civilian agency health officials during a public health emergency.

   15.5.7. Horizontal Integration. PHT members must be familiar with the installation’s
   IEMP 10-2 and DCP guidance on planning for and responding to biological incidents. The
   PHT should plan for integrated response with other installation and off-installation response
   teams, as appropriate.

       15.5.7.1. PHO should coordinate with the PHEO and the installation’s TWG to identify
       preventive measures and assess local threats and current information on vaccines,
       antidotes, and possible disease surveillance trends.

       15.5.7.2. The PHT and the PHEO provide guidance to base first responders on personal
       protective measures to take during a biological incident. See the installation’s DCP for
       more information.

       15.5.7.3. The PHT and the PHEO should coordinate with the wing’s PA office through
       the MCC to provide informational messages to the general public.

       15.5.7.4. PHT should notify CE entomology when control measures are recommended
       for medically important vectors.

       15.5.7.5. PHT interacts with other installation agencies as directed by the installation’s
       DCP.

   15.5.8. Vertical Integration. All communications and requests for assistance or information
   by or to higher echelon or supporting Air Force or DOD commands, as well as local, state,
   tribal, or federal follow-on resources, should be coordinated through appropriate channels
   (MCC, aerospace medicine squadron [AMDS] commander, MDG commander).

15.6. Equipment and Supplies. AS 886P is based on standardized equipment and quantities of
supplies deemed necessary to provide a robust and all-encompassing biological agent response
132                                                       AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

capability to the AFMS. Equipment and supplies may be pre-positioned, repackaged, or
configured to meet local needs as determined by the PHT chief for optimal use at the installation.
AS 886P assets include the following sub-assemblages:

      •   Sub Assemblage AA–Admin
      •   Sub Assemblage EP–Epidemiology
      •   Sub Assemblage FB–Food Borne Illness
      •   Sub Assemblage VB–Vector-borne
      •   Sub Assemblage S1–Safety
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 133

                                          Chapter 16

                              AIR NATIONAL GUARD (ANG)

16.1. Introduction. Medical units at Air Force active duty installations are responsible for
developing, managing, and sustaining critical capabilities to provide MC-CBRN response.
These processes and procedures, allowance standards, and assigned teams are defined in the
MCRP IAW AFI 41-106. The MC-CBRN equipment packages have been adapted for ANG use
to accommodate the smaller installation footprint, smaller number of full-time medical
personnel, and the capabilities of ANG medical groups.

16.2. Purpose. The MC-CBRN program is designed to be operational within 20 minutes of
arrival at the designated staging area of a CBRN event and to fill the gap between the
installation’s initial response capability and the availability of outside assistance. Sole
dependence on CSTs or the CBRNE Enhanced Response Force Package (CERFP) places the
wing at risk because these teams may be committed elsewhere or delayed in their response as
long as 6-12 hours after an event. This program is not specifically designed to support the
civilian community. CSTs and the CERFP fulfill that role. However, MC-CBRN assets may be
deployed within CONUS when requested under the auspices of DSCA with ANG commander’s
approval.

16.3. MC-CBRN Response. A major accident, natural disaster, HAZMAT spill, TIC/TIM or
terrorist/intentional use of CBRN, can occur at anytime without notice. Any incident should be
assessed for potential involvement of CBRN agents until confirmed otherwise. The ability to
respond appropriately is critical in mitigating the consequences of an incident. In the event of a
mass casualty incident, outside resources may be unavailable due to FPCON changes, response
distance, or because an area outside the unit has also been impacted. Community assets may also
be overwhelmed. ANG units must be able to execute the initial response and manage 100
casualties for up to 24 hours after an incident. ANG units must be prepared to provide
decontamination, assist with triage, and, to the extent possible, assist in preparing patients for
emergency transportation to civilian medical care facilities. ANG units should ensure that
evidence is preserved and should provide support for detection, identification, and hazard
evaluation.

   16.3.1. Response Teams. ANG wings not co-located with an active duty installation must
   establish the following capabilities: patient decontamination (AS 976A), triage (AS 976K),
   and BE (AS 976H). ANG bases co-located on an active duty or AFRC base depend on the
   host to provide the full response and, therefore, are not equipped. The ANG teams’ primary
   role is installation consequence management. However, ANG teams may be tasked by the
   state for off-installation response during declared emergencies.

       16.3.1.1. The response teams should be composed of full-time personnel to include
       Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) and state technicians.
134                                                         AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

         16.3.1.2. The patient decontamination team is led by one MDG member who functions
         as the team chief. The remaining 11 team members are drawn from any non-medical
         AFSC provided by other installation organizations.

         16.3.1.3. The triage capability is a small-footprint package viewed as a Self-Aid Buddy
         Care Plus package. This capability is managed by any 4XXXX not assigned to 976A,
         976H, or EOC responsibilities. This individual is not required to be a trained emergency
         medical technician (EMT). While designed for use by physicians, nurses, EMT-trained
         technicians, and fire department paramedics, the 976K capability can be employed by any
         wing personnel with minimal medical training.

         16.3.1.4. The BEE team is comprised of full-time BE technicians.

   16.3.2. Asset Availability. AS 976 assets are available for any type of real-world response
   or exercise as determined by the MDG commander. The National Guard Bureau (NGB)
   authorizes the use of supplies and equipment during NGB/SG required exercises and Federal
   Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)/Regional DSCA exercises. ANG teams may
   require the ability to position supplies, equipment, and personnel at a pre-designated
   assembly point, the MDG facility, elsewhere on the installation, or at a local community
   medical facility.

      16.3.3. Unit Commanders. Unit commanders should ensure that teams are trained,
      organized, equipped, and sustained to execute an appropriate response. Unit commanders are
      also responsible for approving support agreements with civilian and military agencies outside
      the unit to ensure mission capability.

16.4. Logistics. The 976 allowance standards are customer-owned assemblages and will be
managed IAW AFI 41-209. Medical logistics will procure, receive, and issue all required
materials and assist team chiefs in conducting inventories of the allowance standards. Supplies
should be inventoried at least annually and within 30 days of use in a real-world or exercise
scenario. NGB/SG is available to assist in identifying sources of equipment and supplies and for
widespread changes to the allowance standards and will execute purchases centrally.

      16.4.1. Supplies and Equipment. Supplies should be stored in a location that will best
      support an immediate response and should be protected from the elements. This location
      may vary from installation-to-installation. PPE must be stored within the MDG or other
      location where disaster teams assemble. Do not co-mingle supplies with WRM inventories.

      16.4.2. Procurement and Sustainment. For widespread purchases affecting multiple units,
      NGB/SG will centrally manage and execute funding on behalf of each installation. Units
      should identify recurring needs to sustain equipment sets to NGB/SGAXS, which will
      prompt distribution of funding from NGB/SG to the unit for local expenditure.

16.5. Program Funding. NGB/SG participates in the ANG and Air Force Installation Support
Panel (ISP) to advocate for funding to cover equipment, supplies, exercises, and training for the
MC-CBRN program. Funding is programmed through PE 58036F, MC-CBRN Program. This
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                       135

PE is unique to the ANG and parallels the active duty PE 28036F. Note that this PE is different
from the ANG Medical O&M PE 58221F in order to distinctly project requirements and monitor
expenditures for this installation-level support program. NGB/SGAX serves as the PEM for PE
58036F.

16.6. Patient Decontamination Team (976A). The patient decontamination team is designed
to provide patient decontamination capability during the first few hours following a CBRN
incident, peacetime accident, or natural disaster. The ANG patient decontamination team is a
non-deployable, organic medical asset. This capability should not be confused with UTC
FFGLB, Expeditionary Medical Decontamination Team, FFGLA, Expeditionary Medical
Decontamination Equipment, or installation HAZMAT teams. The team’s goals are to maintain
mission capability and save lives.

   16.6.1. Assumptions. The patient decontamination team operates on the assumption that
   gross contamination will be left at the scene and only minimal contamination will arrive at
   the patient decontamination site.

       16.6.1.1. Self-reporters are usually in the minimal triage category; however, people at the
       scene may use vehicles of opportunity to transport delayed or immediate triage category
       victims, especially if a child is involved.

       16.6.1.2. Initial response is considered the first 24 hours after a CBRN event has
       occurred or has been detected and includes crisis and consequence management. It is
       assumed that after the initial 24 hours, support from additional federal, state, and local
       assets should arrive on-scene.

       16.6.1.3. The patient decontamination process should be viewed as a qualitative process
       rather than a quantitative one. All traces of CBRN contaminants may not be removed in
       this process. The objective is to remove or neutralize the bulk of contaminants, thus
       reducing further agent exposures.

       16.6.1.4. The patient decontamination team has only minimal CBRN agent detection
       capability. They perform decontamination procedures based on patient symptoms, input
       from the IC, and their best judgment.

   16.6.2. Capabilities and Limitations. A fully manned (12 personnel), well-trained patient
   decontamination team can decontaminate 6-10 litter patients and 10-15 ambulatory patients
   per hour for a typical scenario. The time to decontaminate will vary depending on the type of
   contaminant and methods required to accomplish decontamination. When deployed by well-
   trained, fully manned team, the patient decontamination system can be operational within 20
   minutes of arrival at the designated decontamination staging area. Note: Decontamination
   operations can be started before the system is fully erected.

       16.6.2.1. Authorization levels or in-stock quantities for AS 976A may be insufficient to
       sustain immediate response (defined as the first 24-hours) for some types of CBRN
       incidents. Where valid, credible threats indicate insufficient stock of equipment and
136                                                         AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

         supplies to respond, the patient decontamination team chief will inform the IC and ESF
         #8 and make recommendations for the procurement of additional equipment and supplies
         to sustain operations.

         16.6.2.2. CBRN agents may not be completely removed or neutralized during the
         decontamination process. Many CBRN agents, once inhaled or ingested, cannot be
         neutralized internally without comprehensive medical intervention, if at all.

         16.6.2.3. Containing run-off from patient decontamination operations is not a primary
         concern of the EPA. Concern for saving life and limb takes precedence over
         environmental contamination. Contaminated run-off from the operation is pumped into a
         bladder and contained until the level of contamination is determined. Based on this
         determination, the water will be disposed of IAW the IEMP 10-2. An support agreement
         for removal and disposal of contaminated water should be established as part of the
         response plan if the ANG unit does not have this capability.

         16.6.2.4. Some equipment may not be salvageable after CBRN contaminant exposure.
         Items absorbent in nature (i.e., cloth, canvas, wood, some paints, and even some silicone-
         based items) cannot always be decontaminated and will have to be disposed of once
         contaminated. The team chief must weigh the value of contaminated items and the cost
         in time and effort before attempting to decontaminate. Coordinate disposal of potentially
         contaminated materials through the BE and Installation Management Flights IAW AFI
         41-201 and AFI 32-7042.

         16.6.2.5. Patient decontamination team members wear Level C PPE, comprised of an
         impermeable protective over garment and PAPR with butyl rubber hood. The PAPR
         generates noise within the protective hood, making all voice communications
         challenging. Level C PPE is adequate for personnel performing decontamination away
         from contamination at the incident scene. As with all CBRN PPE, the potential for heat
         injury is a serious limiting factor for team members. The patient decontamination team
         chief must encourage the consumption of fluids and rotate members before they succumb
         to the effects of heat stress. Consult BE to determine heat stress factors. Patient
         decontamination team members leaving the area for a break must properly decontaminate
         themselves and each other before exiting.

      16.6.3. Training. Upon purchase and receipt of patient decontamination equipment at the
      MDG, a cadre of augmentees from the ANGB should receive contractor-provided on-site,
      hands-on training. The patient decontamination team chief is responsible for ensuring a
      follow-on team chief and all assigned team members are current in their training and
      maintain proficiency.

         16.6.3.1. New team members, not trained in the initial contractor-provided training, must
         receive training within 30 days of assignment to the team by the trained patient
         decontamination cadre.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                               137

     16.6.3.2. Once each year, patient decontamination team training, exercises, or actual
     response must include a full setup of the patient decontamination system with water
     hookup, runoff containment, and patient processing. The patient decontamination team
     must be trained by installation fire protection personnel on flushing, connecting to, and
     turning on a hydrant for adequate operating pressure.

     16.6.3.3. AFI 10-2501, Attachment 6, outlines Air Force requirements to ensure
     compliance with OSHA 29CFR1910.120 (q) (6) (ii). Medical personnel who will
     decontaminate victims must be trained to the HAZWOPER First Responder Operations
     Level with emphasis on the use of PPE and decontamination procedures.

         16.6.3.3.1. Personnel can fulfill annual OSHA training requirements by training with
         sufficient content and duration to maintain competencies or by objectively
         demonstrating competency at the First Receiver Operations Level as described in
         AFI-10-2501.

         16.6.3.3.2. Many of the OSHA HAZWOPER required topics are already
         incorporated into annual MRT classes. Although these classes are usually taught
         from a wartime CBRN perspective, the same principles apply whether responding to
         peacetime or wartime CBRN incidents, deployed or in-garrison. The patient
         decontamination team chief should document this equivalent training to help
         demonstrate compliance with OSHA’s HAZWOPER training requirements.

     16.6.3.4. All team members must be enrolled in the RPP managed by BE. Before
     wearing respirators, team members must complete a medical questionnaire and receive
     medical approval at a minimum. Contact the BE for more information.

     16.6.3.5. Hands-on realistic training is essential for patient decontamination proficiency.
     Ongoing training should be accomplished as part of routine readiness training and
     exercises. Training topics should include triage of contaminated casualties, wound and
     airway management during decontamination, and nerve agent symptoms and antidotes.
     Team members are assumed to be trained to the self-aid buddy care level only and are not
     qualified to provide medical care beyond that level.

     16.6.3.6. The patient decontamination team chief should make every effort to coordinate
     with the installation EET chief to incorporate patient decontamination operations into
     each exercise. The team chief is responsible for developing after-action reports to
     identify areas for improvement.

  16.6.4. Concept of Operations. The patient decontamination team is equipped and staffed
  to decontaminate victims who self-present without being decontaminated at the scene, as
  well as those who require further decontamination before medical treatment. This process
  provides a higher level of decontamination than the on-scene gross decontamination
  procedures performed by the fire department. AS 976A contains paper agent detectors (M-8
  and M-9) only. These papers only detect chemical agents. Personnel must observe signs and
138                                                       AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

   symptoms and look for visible signs of retained contaminants to evaluate the effectiveness of
   the process. Patients may need to repeat the decontamination process if necessary.

      16.6.4.1. The patient decontamination team will activate whenever there is a suspected
      or confirmed CBRN event to provide adequate set-up time, which is critical to timely
      patient processing. MCC protocols and checklists should be updated to reflect this
      policy. Upon activation, the team dons PPE, and the patient decontamination equipment
      is removed from its storage location and assembled. Security forces (or equivalent) will
      perform crowd and traffic control during initial setup and throughout decontamination
      operations.

      16.6.4.2. The primary decontamination methods involve clothing removal and skin
      washing using soap and water. The team will remove all clothing and personal effects
      from victims, including all identifying information, during the decontamination process.
      All of these items are placed into individually labeled plastic bags for processing later.
      This processing may include decontamination and retrieval of valuables and possible
      assessment by law enforcement agencies for evidence if a criminal act has occurred.
      Depending on the nature of the incident, this procedure may be performed by outside
      agencies that arrive later and provide follow-on assistance.

      16.6.4.3. The patient decontamination team provides only minimal health care. The
      patient decontamination team chief conducts triage at the beginning of the
      decontamination process. Wound and airway management can be performed
      simultaneously with clothing removal and skin washing. Mutual aid providers should be
      called upon for triage of victims after decontamination.

      16.6.4.4. The team operates at the MDG facility or another pre-designated site. Site
      selection should take into account the need for the water heater to be located within 100
      feet of a fire hydrant. Hose extensions can be purchased for the fire hose to
      accommodate longer distances.

      16.6.4.5. The patient decontamination area must be enclosed by a security perimeter to
      prevent the possibility of bystander exposure to off-gassing or residual agents. Security
      forces support should be requested to assist with area security as needed. However, in
      the event of a CBRN terrorist event on the installation, security forces personnel will
      likely be fully engaged elsewhere. The IEMP 10-2 should address security measures and
      consider incorporating alternate personnel resources as available.

      16.6.4.6. Communication between team members can become an issue while wearing
      PPE due to the hood and noise created by the PAPR. A system using hand signals should
      be practiced during training/exercises. It is also advisable to label each suit or hood with
      the person’s last name for easier identification.

      16.6.4.7. Patient flow through the decontamination process begins with triage in the
      staging area (warm zone) of the shelter. The triage team provides a quick evaluation of
      the patient’s condition and establishes decontamination priority. The triage team
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                   139

     provides only quick life-saving measures, such as repositioning the neck to open a
     patient’s airway, applying pressure to stop hemorrhaging, or administering chemical
     agent antidotes.

     16.6.4.8. Personnel must focus on the injuries and the exposure level when determining
     which patients have an immediate need for decontamination. Medical support for triage
     will come from field EMTs if available.

     16.6.4.9. Following triage, patients remove clothing and valuables and begin processing
     through the patient decontamination shelter. Personnel will assist ambulatory patients
     with disrobing. Patient decontamination personnel will cut and remove clothing from
     litter patients. Contaminated clothing and valuables will be placed in separate plastic
     bags and labeled. Patient decontamination personnel must be cognizant of the need for
     evidence preservation. Every effort will be made to return patients’ valuables, but
     clothing will not be returned.

     16.6.4.10. After clothing removal, patients proceed through the shelter to the wash and
     rinse area. Litter patients are placed on a backboard and are manually pushed through the
     shelter using a conveyor system.

     16.6.4.11. The decontamination process ensures that patients become progressively
     cleaner from entrance to exit. At the end of the process, patients towel dry, and if a
     chemical agent is involved, their skin is tested with detection paper. Patients are also
     observed for signs or symptoms that indicate the contaminant is still present.

     16.6.4.12. Patients who pass the testing/observation cycle are covered with a blanket.
     Based on their triage category, patients will be transported to a local medical facility or
     receive first aid/minimal treatment by medical technicians.

     16.6.4.13. When all patients have been decontaminated, the team chief will collaborate
     with the MCC, BE, and CE regarding which equipment is salvageable and can be
     decontaminated. Patient decontamination personnel must complete self-decontamination
     before removing PPE.

     16.6.4.14. In keeping with AFIMS and the ICS, the patient decontamination team should
     not respond to a location unless the IC requests this capability. Every ANG unit is
     different, and the IEMP 10-2 should address unique needs based on the threats and
     vulnerabilities identified for each unit.

  16.6.5. Manning. Operation of the patient decontamination system requires 12 personnel.
  Medical units cannot depend on anyone from off-installation to be recalled to staff the patient
  decontamination team in time to provide any benefit to patients. It is advisable to have as
  many trained personnel for back-up as possible to ensure coverage for team members who
  are out on leave, TDY, or are otherwise unavailable for immediate response. ANG manning
  for the patient decontamination team consists of one MDG member and 11 other personnel
  from any non-medical AFSC. The MDG member functions as the team chief. Non-medical
140                                                          AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

  personnel are trained in self-aid buddy care only and are not qualified to provide medical
  care beyond that level. Patient decontamination personnel are trained to the HAZMAT
  operations level designed for MDG first receivers.

         16.6.5.1. Team chiefs are appointed by the MDG commander. Responsibilities are
         defined in AFI 41-106 and include maintaining the team recall roster and binder, writing
         and maintaining the team’s annex and checklists for the IEMP 10-2, conducting and
         documenting training, ensuring allowance standards are maintained at full capability,
         enrolling team members in the RPP (if appropriate), and conducting inventories.

         16.6.5.2. FFGK1, Medical Support Personnel, is a traditional ANG medical UTC
         designed to provide contingency support to the wing. This team is responsible for
         providing secondary support to the patient decontamination team as defined in the
         mission capability statement (MISCAP).

      16.6.6. Integration. MC-CBRN response must be executed alongside the installation’s
      emergency management team (UTC 4F9WM) and the fire department to support force
      survivability and critical mission continuation. Significant collaboration with other response
      teams on and off the installation is required to help maximize all available capabilities. The
      MC-CBRN program must be fully integrated into the installation’s IEMP 10-2 and possible
      revision of MAAs, MOAs, and MOUs with community resources.

         16.6.6.1. Patient decontamination response planning should be coordinated with other
         medical unit and installation decontamination capabilities, as well as follow-on
         capabilities from local, state, tribal, and federal agencies. All interactions with other
         response organizations or work centers within the organizations must be coordinated
         through the MCC.

         16.6.6.2. The patient decontamination team should develop a readiness posture that is
         linked with the installation’s FPCON system. See the installation IEMP or AFI 10-2501
         for guidance concerning FPCON. The team leader should be notified immediately of any
         change in FPCON.

  16.6.7. Equipment and Supplies. AS 976A provides the equipment and supplies for the
  patient decontamination team. It includes a three-lane portable decontamination shelter and
  associated supplies and equipment. The shelter has one lane with a roller system for litter
  patients and two lanes for ambulatory patients. The patient decontamination system is
  equipped to decontaminate 6-10 litter patients and 10-15 ambulatory patients per hour.

         16.6.7.1. The patient decontamination package requires access to a fire hydrant and an
         electrical outlet (110v, 16 amps, GFCI protected) located within 100 feet of the intended
         setup site. (Note: Hose extenders are required to accommodate longer distances.) To
         connect the water system to a standard American hydrant, a 2.5–1.5 inch adapter and two
         50-feet by 1.5-inch hoses are required. The water heater has a built-in check-valve to
         prevent backflow. However, some states require backflow prevention at the source
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                  141

       (between the hydrant and the fire hoses). Installations that require backflow prevention
       devices may need to obtain or purchase one locally.

           16.6.7.1.1. AFI 32-1066 requires the method of connection to be coordinated with
           the installation’s cross connection and backflow prevention program manager.
           (Contact BE or the CE water department for information.)

           16.6.7.1.2. The intended use of a designated fire hydrant as the patient
           decontamination water supply should be coordinated with the installation fire
           department.

           16.6.7.1.3. Patient decontamination team training should include instruction on how
           to flush and connect to a hydrant.

       16.6.7.2. AS 976A includes 24 sets of Level C PPE. Responders who use Level C PPE
       PAPRs do not require respirator fit-testing, but they must be enrolled in the RPP
       monitored by BE. Responders who use negative pressure air-purifying respirators
       (APRs) must have fit testing.

       16.6.7.3. AS 976A equipment must be stored in its response trailer and must be easily
       accessible by vehicle. The 976A concept of operations includes a suggested packing plan
       for the response trailer.

16.7. Triage Capability (976K). In a large-scale event, a surge of patients will quickly
overwhelm community healthcare facilities and their associated first response capabilities. To
maintain mission capability, the wing may implement FPCON security procedures limiting
access to the base. ANG responders may be forced to care for and hold casualties with higher
acuity status for longer than anticipated. The ANG triage capability is designed to provide triage
and stabilizing care for 100 casualties during the initial response phase of an incident. The scope
of care focuses on saving life, limb, and eyesight. AS 976K provides supplies and equipment to
triage and stabilize patients in the immediate and delayed triage categories for transport to
definitive care facilities and provide first aid for patients in the minimal triage category.

   16.7.1. Concept of Operation. The 976K equipment set may be needed at the MDG, on-
   scene, or at some other pre-determined location on the installation. To accommodate this
   mobility, AS 976K supplies and equipment must be packed in the response bags provided in
   the AS and stored with the 976A capability in the NGB/SG-provided response trailer.

       16.7.1.1. Initial assessment and management of patients may be initiated by medically
       trained and qualified personnel or the responding ambulance service. Upon activation,
       the 976K capability manager must work with the ICS response structure to ensure the
       adequate distribution of AS assets. Unit planning must include the unification process,
       development of site medical command and control, and plan for the transfer of patient
       treatment to an off-installation facility (e.g., community healthcare facility).
142                                                       AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

       16.7.1.2. Field triage and stabilization at the scene of a CBRN incident will most likely
       be based on presumptive diagnosis and be limited by the availability and skills of the
       wing personnel and existing resources. Efforts should focus on the effects from
       contamination as well as the severity of injuries. Triage should not occur within the hot
       zone.

   16.7.2. Manning. The triage capability will be managed by any 4XXXX not already
   assigned 976A, 976H, or EOC responsibilities. This individual is not required to be a trained
   EMT. Actual triage operations must be performed by medically trained and qualified
   personnel.

   16.7.3. Activation. 976K is activated upon notification of a suspected CBRN incident by
   the medical group commander or MCC, as described in the IEMP 10-2.

   16.7.4. Equipment and Supplies. The materiel in AS 976K is tailored for triage and
   stabilization of gross injuries among mass casualties. AS 976K may be repackaged or
   configured to meet local needs.

16.8. Bioenvironmental Engineering (BEE) Team (976H). The BEE team serves as the MDG
and installation’s primary resource for conducting CBRN surveillance, health-based risk
assessments, and risk communication. The BEE team provides recommendations on proper
PPE, stay times, and persistency rates and evaluates gross and patient decontamination methods
for effectiveness. The BEE team can perform field industrial hygiene and provide commanders
with an HRA. The BEE team is responsible for providing recommendations and input on
sheltering procedures and site selection. Demand for the BE capability depends on the
magnitude of the incident and the overall mission and capabilities of the MDG and installation.

   16.8.1. Concept of Operations. The BEE team will be activated immediately upon
   notification of a suspected CBRN incident. This activation may come from the MCC, CE
   flight, or ECC. Depending on available manpower, a member of the BEE team may also be
   positioned at the EOC or MCC.

       16.8.1.1. BEE team support will most likely be required at the incident scene and may be
       required at other locations in support of the response/recovery effort. ANG BEE teams
       are trained and equipped to work at the scene in the hot zone.

       16.8.1.2. When the BEE team responds to the field as requested by the IC, the team
       becomes an asset of the IC as soon as they report to the ECP. At this point, all
       communication from the BEE team will be routed by the IC to the EOC, where the ESF
       #8 representative assumes responsibility for updating the MCC.

       16.8.1.3. The BEE team is trained to effectively employ AS 976H to accomplish the
       mission. AS 976H provides the equipment and supplies needed to sample and analyze
       gas, liquid, and solid contaminants for a 24-hour period. It also includes Level A and C
       PPE. NGB may tailor AS 976H to better meet unit-specific needs. Inventory from the
       AS will be stored in the BE office to allow for everyday use as well as training.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 143



     16.8.1.4. The team will increase monitoring of installation water supplies as needed to
     ensure potability, safety, and survivability.

  16.8.2. Manning. The ANG BEE team will be staffed by one or two full-time BEE
  technicians (AFSC 4B051 or 4B071) assigned to the installation. If a bioenvironmental
  engineer is assigned to the unit, the bioenvironmental engineer is assigned to the team as the
  team chief. Traditional-status bioenvironmental engineers working as full-time CE
  environmental managers should be considered a potential resource.

     16.8.2.1. Team chiefs are appointed by the MDG commander. Responsibilities are
     defined in AFI 41-106 and include maintaining the team recall roster and binder, writing
     and maintaining the team’s annex and checklists for the MCRP, conducting and
     documenting training, ensuring the allowance standards are maintained at full capability,
     enrolling team members in the RPP (if appropriate), and conducting inventories in
     conjunction with medical logistics.

     16.8.2.2. Response to incidents occurring on drill weekends will be augmented by
     traditional members. The BEE team may also be manned using other augmentees who
     are trained to the HAZMAT technician level.

  16.8.3. Interoperability. Other Wing organizations, such as FES and R& EM flight have
  HAZMAT response capabilities to provide initial detection at the incident site and define a
  hazard plot. The BEE team provides follow-on assessments and is trained and equipped to
  identify and quantify hazards. It is critical for the BEE team and other responders to share
  information and interact in the form of training and exercises to ensure team interoperability.
144                                                       AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

                                          Chapter 17

                       AIR FORCE RESERVE COMMAND (AFRC)

17.1. Introduction. Medical units at Air Force active duty installations are responsible for
developing, managing, and sustaining critical capabilities to provide MC-CBRN response.
These processes and procedures, allowance standards, and assigned teams must be defined in the
IAW AFI 41-106 and IEMP 10-2. AFRC medical units are exempt from the active duty MC-
CBRN requirements defined in this AFTTP with the exception of BE capabilities (AS 886H).
The 886H equipment package has been adapted for AFRC use to accommodate the smaller
installation footprint, smaller number of full-time personnel, and the capabilities of AFRC BE
offices. All AFRC bases not co-located with an active duty installation (except Naval Air
Station Joint Reserve Base Ft. Worth and Pope Army Air Field) must establish BE capability and
maintain AS 886H. AFRC bases co-located on an active duty base typically do not have full-
time BE assets. They rely on the host base to provide the full response and are not equipped with
AS 886H.

   17.1.1. MC-CBRN Program Objective. The MC-CBRN program is designed to be
   operational within 20 minutes following notification of a CBRN event and to fill the gap
   between the installation’s initial response capability and availability of outside assistance.
   Sole dependence on outside assistance from local, state, federal, or host nation response
   resources can place the installation at risk because these resources may be committed
   elsewhere or delayed in their response as long as 6-12 hours after an event. The MC-CBRN
   program is not specifically designed to support the civilian community. National Guard
   CSTs and the CERFP fill this role. However, MC-CBRN assets may be used off-installation
   when requested under the auspices of DSCA with approval from the installation commander.

   17.1.2. MC-CBRN Response Capabilities. A major accident, natural disaster, HAZMAT
   spill, TIM or terrorist/intentional use of CBRN can occur at anytime without notice. Any
   incident should be assessed for potential involvement of CBRN agents until confirmed
   otherwise. The ability to respond appropriately is critical in mitigating the consequences of a
   CBRN incident. In the event of a mass casualty incident, outside resources may be
   unavailable due to FPCON changes, response distance, or because an area beyond the unit
   has also been impacted. Community assets may also be overwhelmed. AFRC units must be
   capable of executing the initial response for as long as 8 hours following the onset of the
   incident. Unit commanders are responsible for approving support agreements with military
   and civilian agencies outside the unit to ensure mission capability.

       17.1.2.1. The MC-CBRN assets are a component of the overall installation emergency
       response plan (IEMP 10-2). Therefore, AS 886H assets are available for any type of real-
       world or exercise response as determined by the mission support group (MSG)
       commander. AFRC authorizes the use of supplies and equipment during required
       exercises and FEMA or regional DSCA exercises.

       17.1.2.2. The AFRC BEE team provides support for detection, identification, and hazard
       evaluation. The team is composed of full-time BEE technicians. BEE personnel are
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                   145

       responsible for maintaining AS 886H. Unit commanders must ensure that teams are
       trained, organized, equipped, and sustained to execute an appropriate response. AFRC
       BEE teams may be requested for off-installation response during declared emergencies.
       However, their primary role is installation consequence management. Support to the
       community is a secondary responsibility.

17.2. Logistics. AS 886H is a unit-owned assemblage and should be managed IAW AFI 41-
209. The active duty medical logistics division may be asked to procure, receive, and issue all
required materials and should assist team chiefs in conducting inventories of the allowance
standards. AFRC/SG is available to assist in identifying sources of equipment and supplies and
for widespread changes to the allowance standards and will execute purchases centrally.

   17.2.1. Supplies and Equipment. Supplies and equipment should be stored in a location
   that will best support an immediate response and should be protected from the elements.
   This may vary from installation to installation. Do not co-mingle supplies with WRM
   inventories. The AFRC BEE team may require the ability to position supplies, equipment,
   and support personnel at a pre-designated assembly point, which could be at the BEE office
   or elsewhere on the installation. To facilitate access, it might be necessary to store supplies
   and equipment in a mobile trailer that can be moved where needed. PPE must be stored
   within the team office or other location where the team assembles. Supplies should be
   inventoried at least annually and within 60 days of use in a real-world or exercise scenario.

   17.2.2. Procurement and Sustainment. For widespread purchases affecting multiple units,
   AFRC/SG will centrally manage and execute funding on behalf of each installation. Units
   should identify recurring needs to sustain equipment sets through their active duty medical
   logistics function and AFRC/SG, which will prompt distribution of funding from AFRC/SG
   to the unit for local expenditure.

17.3. Program Funding. AFRC/SG participates in the AFRC and Air Force ISP to advocate
for funding to cover equipment, supplies, exercises, and training for the MC-CBRN program.
Funding is programmed through (yet to be assigned) PE (X) 8036F, MC-CBRN Program. This
PE is unique to the AFRC and parallels the active duty PE 28036F and the ANG PE 58036F.
Note that this PE is different from the AFRC Ground Medical O&M PE 58211F in order to
distinctly project requirements and monitor expenditures for this installation-level support
program. AFRC/SGX should) serve as the PEM for PE (X) 8036F.

17.4. Capabilities and Limitations. The BEE team serves as the installation’s primary
resource for conducting CBRN surveillance, HRA, and risk communication. Demand for the
BEE capability depends on the magnitude of the incident and the overall mission and capabilities
of the installation. Depending on available manpower, a member of the BEE team may also be
positioned at the EOC.

   17.4.1. Detection and Assessment. Installation EM and FES have HAZMAT response
   capabilities to provide initial detection at the incident site and define a hazard plot. The BEE
   team provides follow-on assessments and has equipment and skill sets for identifying and
146                                                          AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

   quantifying hazards. It is critical for the BEE team and other responsders to share
   information and interact in the form of training and exercises to ensure team interoperability.

      17.4.2. Risk Assessment and Consultation. The BEE team is responsible for
      recommending proper PPE, stay-times, and persistency rates and evaluating gross and patient
      decontamination methods for effectiveness. The BEE team can perform field industrial
      hygiene and provide commanders an HRA.

      17.4.3. Site Selection. BEEs provide the installation with recommendations and input on
      sheltering procedures and site selection.

      17.4.4. Water Monitoring. The team will increase monitoring of installation water supplies
      to ensure potability, safety, and survivability as needed.

      17.4.5. Constraints and Limiting Factors. Constraints and limiting factors include the
      following:

         17.4.5.1. Manpower required to create response-ready teams is limited. AFRC BEE
         teams must rely heavily upon augmentees and cooperation with R& EM flight and FES
         personnel.

         17.4.5.2. Community support must be coordinated using support agreements.

         17.4.5.3. AFRC medical units do not possess MTFs. There is no physical setting in
         which to treat and hold patients awaiting transport to civilian healthcare facilities.

         17.4.5.4. The BEE team requires a sufficient means of transportation to respond
         immediately to the incident scene with all of the required equipment.

         17.4.5.5. Storage and the capability to have supplies and equipment in a mobile state of
         readiness are lacking.

         17.5.5.6. Tracking and accountability of patients will be difficult and time consuming, if
         it can be accomplished at all. These responsibilities should be integrated into the triage
         process.

17.5. Concept of Operations. The AFRC BEE team and AS 886H provide stand-alone AFRC
bases with a threat agent surveillance response capability. BEE team support will most likely be
required at the incident scene and may be required at other locations in support of the response
effort. A surge for BEE support will occur both during and following a CBRN incident. It is
crucial that BEE capabilities are available to provide rapid identification of the hazards and
technical support to guide the response effort. AFRC BEE teams have the capability and training
to work at the scene in the hot zone. When the BEE team responds to the field at the request of
the IC, the team becomes an asset of the IC as soon as they report to the ECP. BEE team
communications are routed by the IC to the EOC, where the ESF #8 representative assumes
responsibility for updating the ECC.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                              147



   17.5.1. Activation. The BEE team will be activated immediately upon notification of a
   suspected CBRN incident. This activation could come from the ECC or FES.

   17.5.2. Allowance Standard. The BEE team is trained to effectively employ AS 886H to
   accomplish the mission. AS 886H provides equipment and supplies necessary to sample and
   analyze gas, liquid, and solid contaminants for up to an 8 hour period. AS 886H includes
   Level A and C PPE. AFRC may tailor AS 886H to better meet unit specific needs.

17.6. Manning. The AFRC BEE team is staffed by full-time BEE personnel assigned to the
installation. Technician AFSCs should be 43E, 4B051, or 4B071. One or more full-time
personnel in AFRC BEE offices are primarily tasked with 4E051 or 4E071 responsibilities, and
they should be in the first tier of augmentees assigned to accomplish the mission.

   17.6.1. Team Chiefs. Team chiefs are appointed by the MSG commander. Responsibilities
   are defined in AFI 41-106 and include maintaining the team recall roster and binder, writing
   and maintaining the team’s annex and checklists for the IEMP 10-2, conducting and
   documenting training, ensuring the allowance standard is maintained at full capability,
   enrolling team members in the RPP, and conducting inventories in conjunction with medical
   logistics.

   17.6.2. Augmentation. Response to incidents occurring on unit training assembly (UTA)
   weekends may be augmented by traditional reservist (TR) members (where available). The
   BEE team may also be manned using other augmentees who are trained to the HAZMAT
   technician level.

17.7. Integration. MC-CBRN response must be executed alongside the installation’s
emergency management and fire department response to support force survivability and critical
mission continuation. Significant collaboration with other response teams on and off the
installation is required to help identify ways that the installation teams can integrate and
maximize the capabilities of the limited number of personnel available. The MC-CBRN
program must be fully integrated into the installation’s IEMP 10-2 and possible revision of
MAAs, MOAs, and MOUs with community resources.

                                           Chapter 18

               EXERCISE EVALUATION GUIDE (EEG) INSTRUCTIONS

18.1. Exercise Evaluation Guide (EEG) Overview. The EEG template is a comprehensive
guide on exercise evaluation, AARs, and improvement plans. EEG tools provide consistent
standards and guidelines for tasks, data collection, analysis, and report writing. The EEGs are
used in conjunction with the emergency response teams described in this AFTTP. The EEG
template allows an evaluator to collect data during an exercise and easily transfer it to an AAR
after the exercise. The AF Medical Readiness Community of Practice contains exercise
evaluation tools and program information and is available at the following URL:
https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-SG-AF-83/default.aspx

18.2. Guidance. Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-5, Management of
Domestic Incidents; Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-8, National Preparedness; AFPD 10-
25, Emergency Management; AFI 41-106; AFI 90-201, The Air Force Inspection System; and
AFI 10-2501 provide some of the basic foundation, structure, and guidance supporting the
objectives of this chapter. This chapter provides guidance to Air Force personnel who design,
plan, evaluate and participate in exercises. This chapter supports the HSEEP.

18.3. AS 886 EEGs. The AS 886 EEGs are adapted for use by AFMS MTF exercise evaluators
for use by MCRP teams. EET chiefs can approve modifications to add additional tasks to these
EEGs. The AS 886 EEGs are available on the Air Force Medical Support Agency Homeland
Medical Plans Division Knowledge Exchange at the following URL:
https://kx.afms.mil/forceprotection

18.4. Pre-Exercise Activities. The exercise planning and EETs are responsible for developing
exercise objectives and scenarios using the EEGs.

   18.4.1. Exercise Objectives. EEGs help ensure exercises employ the capabilities-based
   planning concept and facilitate the conduct and evaluation of exercises. This process also
   assists in building the Master Scenario Events List (MSEL). The EET chief determines the
   priority tasks of the exercise. EET members should review of the EEG’s tasks and
   performance measures and develop objectives using the Simple, Measurable, Achievable,
   Reliable, and Task-Oriented (SMART) model.

       •   Simple: Related to something identified or particularized.
       •   Measureable: Consisting of a prescribed action and a quantifiable indicator (i.e.,
           expressed as time, percentage).
       •   Achievable: To succeed in doing or gaining something usually with effort.
       •   Reliable: Able to be trusted to be accurate or to provide a correct result.
       •   Task Oriented: Specific responses that personnel may perform during the exercise.

   18.4.2. Installation-Specific Objectives. After identifying the exercise objectives, the
   exercise planners and evaluation teams should decide which tasks within each EEG should
   be exercised and evaluated and then customize the EEGs to fit the exercise objectives. Once
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                149

   a task is identified as part of the EEG, all of the tasks and performance measures associated
   with the task must appear on the EEG. Customize EEGs to fit installation-specific plans,
   policies, and procedures. While tasks and performance measures are not normally removed
   from the selected EEG, additional installation-specific tasks and performance measures may
   be added.

   18.4.3. Preparation. Before an exercise, evaluators must familiarize themselves with the
   EEGs for the tasks they will observe, including any installation-specific tasks based on the
   objectives of the exercise. Exercise evaluators should be familiar with the EEG, understand
   the material covered, and develop a plan for unscheduled events that may take place during
   the exercise.

18.5. Exercise Evaulation. During an exercise, evaluators are responsible for performing the
following tasks using the EEG:

   18.5.1. Record Completion of Tasks. For each task, evaluators should determine if the task
   was fully completed, partially completed, not completed, or not applicable. This rating is not
   a report card, but rather an objective record of the task. The EEG provides an observation
   summary below each task.

   18.5.2. Record Demonstration of Performance Measures. Upon completion of the
   exercise tasks, the identified performance measures enable evaluators to record the actions of
   exercise participants and compare them to specific targets. Performance measures capture
   quantifiable performance information such as execution times (e.g., time for point of
   distribution to be activated) and success rates (e.g., percentage of patients treated during
   point of distribution activation).

   18.5.3. Record Supplemental Notes. While the EEGs contain an extensive list of tasks
   designed to help guide evaluators’ observations, evaluators must also record supplemental
   notes during the exercise. These notes play a key part in lessons learned and improvement
   plans for future exercises. Note that the EEG form provides minimal space for notes, so
   evaluators should plan ahead on how they will annotate supplemental observations.

18.6. Post-Exercise Activities. EEG evaluations should be compiled and incorporated into an
AAR, which forms the basis for the improvement plan and reporting of lessons learned. The
final EEGs, to include the AARs and recommended improvement plans, are due to the EET chief
within 30 days after exercise completion. The EET chief should file these documents according
to local procedures. Evaluators must complete the following sections of the EEG.

   18.6.1. Observation Summary. Compile the exercise EEGs, supplemental notes, and other
   references and complete the Observation Summary section of the EEG.

   18.6.2. Task Summary. Record the activities performed, sequence of events, and times
   actions occurred.
150                                                     AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

   18.6.3. Observation Analysis. Record the top three strengths and top three areas for
   improvement observed during the performance of each exercise activity.

18.7. Response Training and Assessment Program (RTAP). RTAP is a comprehensive
training, exercise, performance assessment, and evaluation program controlled by commanders
that provides installations a tool to optimize cross-functional emergency response in an all
hazards environment. This program provides tools that may be used by Wing Inspection Teams
to monitor program management compliance, and the Wing Inspection Team (WIT) to assist
commanders in assessing integrated wing response performance. It also provides supervisors a
tool to conduct training on individual and integrated response processes. The HQ ACC/SGXH
SharePoint site contains Response Training and Assessment Program exercise evaluation tools
and program information and is available at the following URL:

functions. Emergency Responders include follow-on elements such as firefighters, law
enforcement personnel, security personnel, and emergency medical technicians, as well as
emergency management personnel, EOD personnel, physicians, nurses, medical treatment
providers at medical treatment facilities, public health officers, bioenvironmental engineering
personnel, and mortuary affairs personnel. Emergency Responders also include specialized
teams such as the RST or SMT. Not all Emergency Responders are First Responders, but all
First Responders are Emergency Responders. Emergency Responders are not assigned to
additional duties that will conflict with their emergency duties. For the purposes of AFIMS,
EOD personnel are considered Emergency Responders but not First Responders. (See also First
Responders.) (AFI 10-2501)

Emergency Responders (medical)—Disaster Response Force members who deploy after first
responders and provide additional support. They include follow-on medical personnel, including
additional ambulance support, physicians, nurses, technicians, and other specialized teams.

ordinarily leave the facility and are therefore not considered emergency responders. Examples of
MCRP teams in the emergency responder category include the Field Response Team, Triage
Team, Public Health Team, and Nursing Services Team. (AFI 41-106)

First Receivers—Healthcare workers at a medical facility that may receive contaminated
victims for treatment. (AFI 10-2501) [First receivers typically include the following personnel:
clinicians and other medical staff who have a role in receiving and treating contaminated victims
at the medical unit such as medical unit triage personnel, personnel conducting patient
decontamination, the patient administration team, and the manpower/security team.]

First Responders—The primary health care providers whose responsibility is the provision of
immediate clinical care and stabilization in preparation for evacuation to the next health service
support capability in the continuum of care. In addition to treating injuries, they treat Service
members for common acute minor illnesses. (JP 1-02) [The field response team is the only first
response team in the medical unit.]

Gross Decontamination—(Also known as Hasty or Expedient Decontamination.) The start of
the decontamination process during which the amount of surface contaminants is significantly
reduced. This process typically includes as a minimum completely flushing with water and the
removal of most or all of a person’s clothing while continuing to flush. When warranted,
decontamination soap or other products may be provided. The EPA does not require runoff
control when this decontamination process is used to save lives or reduce injury. (AFI 10-2501)

Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT)—Any material that is flammable, corrosive, an oxidizing
agent, explosive, toxic, poisonous, etiological, radioactive, nuclear, unduly magnetic, a chemical
agent, biological research material, compressed gases, or any other material that, because of its
quantity, properties, or packaging, may endanger life or property. (AFI 10-2501)

Hospital Decontamination Zone—The area is use for the decontamination of victims and
responders before entering the Medical Treatment Facility.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                  165

prevent adverse effects from HAZMAT releases to personnel outside the zone. (AFI 10-2501)

Identification—In CBRNE operations, the determination of which CBRNE material or
pathogen is present. (AFI 10-2501)

Initial Response—Resources initially committed to an incident. (AFI 10-2501) [As used in this
AFTTP, the initial phases after a CBRN event has occurred or been detected. Initial response
includes crisis and consequence management to rescue, stabilize, contain contamination, and
preserve evidence. Outside assistance will likely be unavailable during this initial response
timeframe.]

Prepared Environmental Sample—Raw sample that has undergone the following procedures
by qualified BE personnel or equivalent using approved techniques: (a) transfer of raw sample
into a container holding a phosphate buffer solution or another approved transport medium; (b)
proper contamination avoidance procedures for sample container; and (c) proper chain-of-
custody procedures to include forms approved by the state to include contextual information
such as results of field screening tests and purpose of requested lab analysis.

Presumptive Identification—The tentative determination of a CBRNE material or pathogen’s
identity with sufficient specificity and confidence to make expedient, risk-based control
decisions until confirmatory identification can be completed. (AFI 10-2501)

Processed Environmental Sample—Prepared sample that has undergone nucleic acid
extraction/purification for analysis using the appropriate agent assay, culturing, or other
microbiological tests such as ECL using the M1M analyzer.

Technical Decontamination—(Also known as thorough or nine-step process decontamination.)
The physical or chemical process of deliberate decontamination to achieve a thorough cleansing
and removal of contaminants from personnel and equipment. The EPA requires run-off control
for this type of process. (AFI 10-2501) [The patient decontamination process is an example of
technical decontamination.]

Toxic Industrial Chemical (TIC)—A chemical developed or manufactured for use in industrial
operations or research by industry, government, or academia. For example: pesticides,
petrochemicals, fertilizers, corrosives, poisons. These chemicals are not primarily manufactured
for the specific purpose of producing human casualties or rendering equipment, facilities, or
areas dangerous for human use. Hydrogen cyanide, cyanogens chloride, phosgene, and
chloropicrin are industrial chemicals that also can be military chemical agents. (JP 1-02)

Toxic Industrial Materials (TIM)—A generic term for toxic or radioactive substances in solid,
liquid, aerosolized, or gaseous form that may be used, or stored for use, for industrial,
commercial, medical, military, or domestic purposes. Toxic industrial material may be chemical,
biological, or radioactive and described as toxic industrial chemical, toxic industrial biological,
or toxic industrial radiological. (JP 1-02)

Warm Zone—The area where personnel and equipment and hot zone support take place. It
includes control points for the access corridor and thus assists in reducing the spread of
contamination. (AFI 10-2501)

Weapon of Mass Destruction (WMD)—Chemical, biological radiological, or nuclear weapons
capable of a high order of destruction or causing mass casualties and exclude the means of
transporting or propelling the weapon where such means is a separable and divisible part from
the weapon. (JP 1-02)

          PATIENT DECONTAMINATION FACILITY SETUP PROCEDURES

A.3.1. Purpose. This chapter provides an overview on how to set up the equipment contained
in AS 886A. It is not intended to replace professional training. This chapter can be used as a
refresher for a professionally trained patient decontamination team member or may serve as a
guide when training new students.

A.3.2. Patient Decontamination Facility. AS 886A contains a pop-up shelter as shown in
Figure A.3.1. While patient decontamination does not have to be conducted inside a shelter, a
shelter is preferred to protect patients, personnel, and equipment from harsh environmental
conditions and to ensure patient privacy. The patient decontamination facility is designed to
become progressively cleaner from entrance to exit. Patients pass through four stations: The
first station is for clothing removal; the second station is for washing; the third station is for
rinsing; and the fourth station is for re-monitoring and towel drying. Typically the exit of the
decontamination facility is known as the hot-line that nothing crosses unless it’s clean.

                        Figure A.3.1. Patient Decontamination Shelter




A.3.3. Setup and Operational Recommendations. To achieve mission capability, the shelter
must be erected, decontamination stations must be in place to include a working hot water heater
and initial wastewater control, and team members must be in PPE gear. Air Force tests
conducted with a patient decontamination team of 12 members indicate dividing the team into
three sub teams to accomplish these tasks is the most effective way to quickly achieve
operational capability. For a 12-member team, it is recommended that 6 members set up the
facility, 2 members set up the water system, and 4 members don PPE. As members finish
donning their PPE, they can rotate into the setup area and allow other members to don PPE.

   A.3.3.1. Patient Decontamination Zone Layout. Figure A.3.2 shows an example patient
   decontamation zone layout. While positioning the tent with regards to wind direction is
   ideal, do not attempt to reposition the tent if the winds shift.
170                                                        AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013



                   Figure A.3.2. Example Patient Decontamination Zone




   A.3.3.2. Patient Flow. The team NCOIC (or the patient decontamination team chief) is
   typically stationed at the front of the shelter to direct patient flow. Primary triage personnel
   perform initial pre-decontamination triage and are positioned in the staging area in front of
   the decontamination area. Ambulatory patients flow through both sides of the shelter, male
   on one side, female on the other. The team chief (or the team NCOIC) is typically stationed
   at the rear of the shelter with radio communications to direct and help transport
   decontaminated patients to the secondary triage element. Secondary triage personnel
   perform post-decontamination triage and are positioned in the cold zone between the
   decontamination area and the medical facility. The team is staged inside or near the entrance
   to the medical unit to prevent potential hypothermia to patients.

   A.3.3.3. Radio Communications. Radio communication must be maintained with the
   MCC. Although AS 886 does not include radios, the patient decontamination, triage, and
   manpower/security team chiefs usually have radios assigned to the team (similar to other
   disaster team chiefs) to communicate with the MCC. The primary triage team should
   maintain radio communications with ambulances to evaluate whether patients arriving by
   ambulance from the incident site require additional decontamination. The primary triage
   team must maintain communications with the patient decontamination team chief and the
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                    171

   MCC regarding patient flow rates, injury types, and additional manpower and supply needs.
   They must also communicate with physicians inside the medical unit through the MCC
   regarding any special medical interventions patients may require.

A.3.4. Shelter Erecting Procedures. Erecting the patient decontamination shelter involves the
following steps.

   Step 1. Move the shelter to the setup site using the shelter cart as shown in Figure A.3.3.
   This step requires two people.

                                  Figure A.3.3. Shelter Cart




   Step 2. Remove the berm from the berm bag shown in Figure A.3.4.

                                   Figure A.3.4. Berm Bag




   Step 3. Unroll the berm and lay it flat, using the grab straps. This step requires four to eight
   people. If the berm was rolled properly, eight red grab straps should be available. Ensure the
   berm is right side up. The top of the berm has eight yellow clips as shown in Figure A.3.5.
172                                                       AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

                                                                                                Clips




  Step 4. Move the shelter bag to the center of the berm (see Figure A.3.6.). This step requires
  four people. Use the lifting straps located on the bag to move the shelter. Team members
  should lift high and avoid dragging the shelter. Assuming the shelter was packed correctly,
  the top should have yellow reflectors indicating the direction of the shelter throughput as
  shown in Figure A.3.7.

                            Figure A.3.7. Throughput Reflectors




   Step 5. Open the shelter bag, including the straps and Velcro, and lay the bag flat on the
   berm. Remove the yellow compression strap from the shelter as shown in Figure A.3.8.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                   173

                            Figure A.3.8. Shelter Bag and Straps




  Step 6. Stretch the shelter. This step requires four people. Each corner of the shelter has
  two red grabbing straps. Each person should grab the lifting straps, one in each hand, and
  pull as shown in Figure A.3.9. Be alert for any resistance in case something catches and
  needs untangling.

                             Figure A.3.9. Stretching the Shelter




  Step 7. To lift the shelter, position two lifters at the yellow reflectors at each end of the
  shelter (four people total). Use a black metal strut to lift the shelter high enough to rest on
  the white push poles on each end, as shown in Figure A.3.10.

   Step 8. Two team members should place the other two push poles under the shelter at the
   silver bolts on the center white curtain as shown in Figure A.3.11.

                              Figure A.3.11. Push Pole Placement




  Step 9. When all four push poles are in place, raise the shelter completely as shown in
  Figure A.3.12.

                                Figure A.3.12. Raised Shelter




   Step 10. Clip the shelter to the berm. This step requires at least two people (with one person
   working on each side of the shelter). Start with the four outer corner clips, and then attach
   the four inner clips.

   Step 11. Clip and tighten the red outer straps on the shelter as shown in Figure A.3.13.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 175

                           Figure A.3.13. Shelter Clips and Straps




   Step 12. When the red outer straps are secure, lower the lifting poles and secure to the sides
   of the shelter as handrails as shown in Figure A.3.14.

                              Figure A.3.14. Shelter Handrails




Step 13. Anchor the shelter. The shelter comes with an anchor kit that includes yellow lines and
stakes as shown in Figure A.3.15.

                                  Figure A.3.15. Anchor Kit
176                                                           AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013



Step 14. If the shelter is erected on pavement, use 32-gallon trash cans filled with water to
anchor the shelter as shown in Figure A.3.16. Ideally, once a setup site is selected, permanent
tie-down eye-bolts (like aircraft tie-down anchors) should be recessed into the pavement at the
shelter stake-down points to facilitate anchoring.

                          Figure A.3.16. Shelter Anchored on Pavement




A.3.5. Patient Decontamination Station Setup Procedures. Setting up the patient
decontamination stations involves the following steps:

   Step 1. Open the conveyor bags and stretch the conveyors down the center of the berm as
   shown in Figure A.3.17. AS 886A includes two 10-foot conveyors. This step requires two
   people.

                                   Figure A.3.17. Conveyor Belt




      Step 2. Connect the Velcro in the middle of the conveyors and place the white safety stops
      on the two ends.

      Step 3 (For original floor grids). If using the original Reeves floor grids, set the black floor
      elevation pallets lengthwise inside the berm. This step requires two to six people. The
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 177

  pallets are three feet wide by eight feet long. Start along the conveyor and lay four pallets on
  each side for a total of eight as shown in Figure A.3.18. Note: The pallets do not fit tightly
  in the berm to allow space for the wastewater transfer pump (depending on the slope of setup
  area).

                              Figure A.3.18. Elevation Pallets




  Step 3 (For new floor grids). The newer IRT floor grids have six different sized grids.
  Follow the schematic in Figure A.3.19 for proper laydown of these grids. It is recommended
  that a local laydown plan be developed, such as color coding or numbering the grids, to
  facilitate this process.

                           Figure A.3.19. IRT Floor Grid Laydown
178                                                         AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013



   Step 4. Connect in the lane curtains and spray wands as shown in Figures A.3.20.

                         Figure A.3.20. Lane Curtains and Spray Wands




      Step 5. Connect the water heater to a fire hydrant using a fire hose and a 2.5–1.5 inch
      adapter as shown in Figure A.3.21. Be sure to flush the hydrant before connecting it to the
      water heater. Normally the water heater should be positioned on the clean side of the shelter
      for easier operations.

                            Figure A.3.21. Water System Components




   Step 6. Connect the red and blue water line camlocks to the water heater and the shelter as
   shown in Figure A.3.22. The red lines have decontaminant injected and flow toward the hot
   zone. The blue lines are for rinsing and flow toward the shelter’s cold zone. Note: The red
   and blue colors do not indicate hot and cold water temperature.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                     179

                               Figure A.3.22. Water Line Hookup




   Step 7. Before starting the water heater, ensure that the fuel can contains diesel fuel (NOT
   bio-diesel) and that 110-volt GFCI protected electricity is available. Note: Follow
   manufacturer’s instructions.

   Step 8. Start the water heater and ensure water is flowing from the water heater into the
   shelter.

   Step 9. Once water is flowing, check the baseline cool water temperature.

   Step 10. Turn the water heater switch to the on position and wait 10 seconds. If the heater is
   working, set the temperature inside the shelter to 98.6 degrees. If the heater is not working
   after 10 seconds, check the fuel, electricity, and water flow systems for problems.

   Step 11. Add the soap mixture to the injection reservoir tanks. The soap mixture should be
   10 ounces of dishwashing liquid (e.g., Dawn) per gallon of water, or one 25-ounce bottle of
   dishwashing liquid for each full tank.

A.3.6. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). During setup, all team members must remain
vigilant for patient arrivals. If potentially contaminated patients arrive at any time before setup is
complete, all team members must immediately retreat indoors and don PPE before completing
setup. The triage team (primary and secondary) is activated in conjunction with the patient
decontamination team and has its own PPE on AS 886K. Manpower/security team (decon
support subteam) personnel are also activated in conjunction with the patient decontamination
team and have their own PPE on AS 886M. All members wearing PPE should receive
HAZMAT first receiver operations and respiratory protection training and ensure a proper
buddy-check system before entering the medical warm-zone operations area. Figure A.3.23
shows an example of the PPE used by the patient decontamination team.
180                                                       AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

A.3.7. Wastewater Management. EPA alert EPA 550-F-00-009, First Responders’
Environmental Liability Due to Mass Decontamination Runoff, states:

   Once any imminent threats to human health and life are addressed, first responders should
   immediately take all reasonable efforts to contain the contamination and avoid or mitigate
   environmental consequences.

On a level surface, the black berm under the shelter holds approximately 1,000 gallons and
eventually, the run-off must be pumped into a holding bladder.

   A.3.7.1. Controlling Run-Off. Follow these procedures to pump the run-off from the berm
   into a holding bladder.

       Step 1. Place the wastewater pump in the berm.

       Step 2. Place the wastewater bladder within 20 feet of the pump as shown in Figure
       A.3.24. Normally the wastewater bladder is positioned on the dirty side of the shelter.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                              181

                            Figure A.3.24. Wastewater Bladder




       Step 3. Connect the pump to the bladder with the gray hose and the back-flow
       prevention device provided in the pump bag as shown in Figure A.3.25.

                                Figure A.3.25. Pump Setup




       Step 4. Ensure GFCI protection, and plug the pump into a 110-volt outlet.

   A.3.7.2. Wastewater Analysis and Disposal. Before disposing of wastewater, contact the
   installation Installation Management Flight to arrange for proper disposal. They may require
   wastewater sampling and analysis for hazardous waste characterization so they can determine
   proper treatment and disposal procedures . Points of contact for this agency should be
   included in Annex N of the MCRP and in local checklists.

   A.3.7.3. Wastewater Collection. During the recovery phase of the response, there may be a
   requirement for either the AFOSI or FBI to collect wastewater samples for evidence. Points
   of contact for this agency should also be included in Annex N of the MCRP and in local
   checklists.

A.3.8. Ventilation and Off-Gassing. Off-gassing can cause vapor concentrations to increase in
an enclosed shelter. The significance of vapor concentration during decontamination operations
182                                                         AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

is difficult to predict and depends on the agent, quantity present, air temperature, and various
other factors. Although patient decontamination team members are protected from chemical
agent vapors by PPE, patients are vulnerable. To minimize vapor build-up in the facility,
increase ventilation (e.g., opening doors) and frequently remove bags of contaminated waste
materials from the interior of the shelter.

A.3.9. Water Heater Maintenance. When the mission is complete, make sure all water has
been drained or completely emptied from the water heater to avoid corrosion and freeze damage.
Water must be emptied from the main pipes as well as the Dosetron soap injection system. A
bicycle pump can be used to push air through the Schrader valve (located behind the check
valve) to clear remaining water out of the water heater. When the center piston is removed from
the Dosetron soap injection system, the outer reservoir ring still houses water and is where many
water heaters crack from freeze damage. Use a syringe to draw remaining water from the outer
reservoir ring. The manufacturer recommends running the water heater at least every 90 days to
prevent internal corrosion and keep it operational.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                   183

                     PATIENT DECONTAMINATION PROCEDURES

A.4.1. Purpose. Decontamination procedures must prevent re-contamination of patients and
protect the medical staff and facilities. Patient decontamination may cause a bottleneck in
patient movement on the way to more definitive treatment in the medical unit. To help ensure a
smooth traffic flow, the patient decontamination system uses an assembly line approach. This
approach divides the decontamination process into separate stations that handle successively
cleaner tasks. Each station operates in its own space to facilitate patient flow. Therefore, team
members perform fewer tasks and are less likely to accidentally skip a step.

A.4.2. Station 1: Triage, Emergency Treatment, and Security. Station 1 is located in front of
the patient decontamination tent. The primary triage team performs triage and lifesaving
emergency medical treatment before the patient decontamination process. The
manpower/security decontamination support sub-team (a sub-set of the manpower/security team)
also works in this section to ensure an orderly flow of patients and vehicles, using supplies and
PPE from 886M.

   A.4.2.1. Patient Flow. Unless otherwise instructed by the medical commander, patients are
   processed through the decontamination facility in the following priority: 1–Immediate; 2–
   Minimal; 3–Delayed.

   A.4.2.2. Triage. Triage personnel may move from station to station as necessary to
   maintain patient stabilization. Once ABCs are established on the patient, continue complete
   patient assessment and proceed with decontamination operations. Litter patients are placed
   on a NATO litter which then fits on the TVI transfer board and placed on the patient
   conveyor system. If necessary, a backboard may also be used for spine support when a back
   or neck injury is suspected. When used, the patient and backboard should be strapped to the
   NATO litter for safety of the patient, then the litter is placed on the TVI transfer board and
   onto the conveyor.

   A.4.2.3. Emergency Treatment. The scope and limitations of treatment are based on
   medical resources available, patient arrival rates, and type of contaminant. Treatment at
   Station 1 may include the administration of auto-injectors and diazepam, application of
   pressure dressings, establishing a patient airway, and starting IV infusions. If a liquid agent
   has contaminated a patient, it can be covered during life-saving treatment. Contaminated
   clothing can be cut away or removed.

   A.4.2.4. Cross-Contamination. Emergency medical equipment used to treat patients before
   decontamination should be decontaminated as completely as possible to avoid cross-
   contamination between patients. However, because patients are only minutes away from a
   body wash-down, cross-contamination is not a major concern.

   A.4.2.5. Supplies and Equipment. Medical supplies, equipment, and PPE for Station 1
   should be obtained from AS 886K, not AS 886A.
184                                                         AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013



   A.4.2.6. PPE Constraints. Wearing PPE can limit patient assessment because of the
   reduction of tactile sensation necessary for the assessment of pulses, respirations, skin
   temperature, and skin turgor. If patients are wearing any type of PPE, this too can obstruct
   access and complicate assessment of the patient’s condition and treatment. For this reason,
   medical unit personnel must frequently train and exercise the patient movement, triage, and
   decontamination process using assets from 886A, 886K, and 886M to gain proficiency and
   ensure currency and competency in these vital skills.

A.4.3. Station 2: Clothing Cut and Removal Station. Station 2 is the first stop inside the
patient decontamination tent. Station 2 has two members stationed on the litter patient line and
two members stationed on each ambulatory patient line. One patient decontamination team
member should be assigned to facilitate operations, such as assisting with patient traffic, tending
the heater, and assisting other patient decontamination team members as needed.

   A.4.3.1. Process Overview. Patient decontamination procedures differ from standard
   wartime decontamination procedures because CBRN incidents typically involve a surprise
   attack or accident in which personnel are usually caught unprepared and unprotected (i.e.,
   without mission-oriented protective posture [MOPP] gear). Clothing provides little or no
   protection from contaminants. Most clothing readily absorbs contaminants and holds
   contaminants against the patient’s skin until the clothing is removed (especially CW agents
   designed to be absorbent). Immediate stripping of clothing and skin washing is imperative.
   Unlike the step-by-step process of cutting away a contaminated ground crew ensemble,
   contaminated clothing must be removed as rapidly as possible without any particular concern
   for the process or order of removal. AS 886A provides scissors and rescue knives for this
   purpose.

   A.4.3.2. Litter Patients. As litter patients arrive from Station 1 (Triage), begin the process
   of clothing removal. Cut off all the patient’s clothes. Roll patients on their sides (away from
   the conveyor system) and complete the clothing removal process, then move the patient on
   to Station 3 for washing.

   A.4.3.3. Ambulatory Patients. Ambulatory patients are capable of removing their own
   clothes. Patients processing through the ambulatory decontamination line should be
   supervised and assisted by a member of the patient decontamination team.

   A.4.3.4. Clothing and Personal Items. All patient clothing and personal effects should be
   placed into individual plastic personal effects bags (included in AS 886A). These bags
   should be labeled with the patient’s name (if readily available), sealed, and placed outside the
   patient decontamination zone for processing later. This processing may include
   decontamination and retrieval of valuables and possible assessment by law enforcement
   agencies for evidence if a criminal act has occurred. Depending on the nature of the incident,
   this procedure may be performed by outside agencies that arrive later and provide follow-on
   assistance. Note: Consider allowing patients to maintain identification, e.g. ID cards, driver’s
   license, etc.,that can be easily decontaminated.
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                   185

   A.4.3.5. Scissors and Rescue Knives. Using bandage scissors and rescue knifes in
   combination helps ensure fast and accurate clothing removal. Use scissors for the tight or
   difficult to access areas (neck and shoulder areas), and use rescue knives for straight or long
   cuts (sleeves and pant legs). Standard bandage scissors typically become dull after cutting
   two or three complete uniforms or civilian suits. Replace scissors frequently. Rescue knives
   have a tendency to clog but can be easily cleared with any pointed instrument. Cutting
   blades and scissors left wet overnight will rust. When real-world operations or training
   sessions are over, rinse the instruments in clear water and spray them with lubricant (WD-40)
   to prevent corrosion.

   A.4.3.6. Cross-Contamination. Contaminated scissors and knives should be
   decontaminated as completely as possible to avoid cross contamination between patients.
   However, because patients are only minutes away from a body wash-down, cross-
   contamination is not a major concern.

A.4.4. Station 3: Wash and Rinse Station. Station 3 is the second stop inside the patient
decontamination tent. Station 3 has four members stationed on the litter patient line.

   A.4.4.1. Contaminant Removal. Soap and water is the most effective way to remove
   contaminants from skin and hair. RSDL can also be used for self decontamination as well as
   to neutralize CW agents. However, RSDL is not currently approved for whole-body
   decontamination or for TIC/TIM decontamination. RSDL is not recommended for
   decontaminating wounds because it may impair the healing process. Wash patients’ skin
   using soap and water. In open wounds, use a mild soap that cuts grease (e.g., Dawn
   dishwashing liquid). Note that minor bleeding wounds are self-decontaminating wounds.

   A.4.4.2. Litter Patient Decontamination. For litter patients, do the following:

       A.4.4.2.1. Wash from front to back of contaminated body surfaces.

       A.4.4.2.2. Focus on hairy areas and creases of the body that may harbor contamination.

       A.4.4.2.3. Attempt to wash long hair, but if contamination persists, it may have to be cut
       using scissors.

       A.4.4.2.4. Roll the patient from side to side to ensure the patient’s backside and the
       backboard underneath are cleaned.

   A.4.4.3. Ambulatory Patient Decontamination. For ambulatory patients, do the
   following:

       A.4.4.3.1. Have the patient step up on the shower pallet in the shower area.

       A.4.4.3.2. Assist patients with washing their bodies, focusing on creases and hairy areas.
       Hair is very difficult to decontaminate. If contamination persists, hair may have to be cut
       with scissors.
186                                                         AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013



   A.4.4.4. Soap Mixture. Do not use pure dishwashing soap in the injection system as it will
   clog the system and cause eye irritation. The recommended mixture is 10 ounces of
   dishwashing liquid per gallon of water in the injection reservoir tank (the white jug). The
   injection reservoir tank holds 2.5 gallons. Use one 25-ounce bottle of dishwashing liquid per
   full tank of water.

A.4.5. Station 4: Dry and Re-Monitor. Station 4 is the last stop inside the patient
decontamination zone. Station 4 has two members positioned on the litter patient line. The
patient decontamination team chief also operates from this location.

   A.4.5.1. Patient Processing. Evaluate patients for signs of gross contamination. If visible,
   return them to Station 3 for further washing. If patients are clean, dry them with a towel and
   cover them with a blanket. Provide ambulatory patients with gown coats and booties.

   A.4.5.2. Litter Patients. Patients should be removed from the transfer board and placed in
   the cold zone where the patient will be transferred to a clean, dry litter. Manpower/security
   team personnel (not patient decontamination team personnel) transfer the patient and clean,
   dry litter from the vapor hot line to the secondary triage team for re-triaging and for more
   definitive treatment.

   A.4.5.3. Backboards. Backboards and litters are washed along with the patients in Station
   3. However, after patients are transferred to clean, dry litters for treatment outside the patient
   decontamination, the original litters and straps should be processed back through the line and
   re-washed at Station 3 and re-used.

A.4.6. Station 5: Re-Triage After Patient Decontamination Operations. The secondary
triage team re-triages patients before admission into the medical unit or transport to a receiving
facility. The secondary triage team should stage inside or as close to the medical unit’s entrance
as possible to protect patients from potential hypothermia and to minimize the distance that
patients have to be transported. Patient decontamination team members must not be dual-tasked
as members of the secondary triage team. Since patients have already been decontaminated, the
secondary triage team does not need to don PPE.

A.4.7. Self Decontamination for IPPD/Triage/Manpower/Security. There are three different
considerations regarding self decontamination: when the shift or event has ended, when taking a
break as part of the work-rest cycle, etc., and when the individual is in distress.

A.4.7.1. End of Shift/End of Event

   A.4.7.1.1. Buddy wash in the litter lane

   A.4.7.1.2. Doff protective clothing in pre-decon warm zone in the following sequence:

       A.4.7.1.2.1. The outer glove is integrated as part of DTAPS suit, so remove by slipping
       hands out, then turn the gloves inside out
AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013                                                                   187



       A.4.7.1.2.2. Loosen/secure PAPR belt (avoid shaking)

       A.4.7.1.2.3. Remove PAPR hood

       A.4.7.1.2.4. Partially remove suit, turning it inside out and folding downward

       A.4.7.1.2.5. Remove boots

       A.4.7.1.2.6. Finish removing suit

       A.4.7.1.2.7. Remove inner glove and discard into bio-hazard trash container

A.4.7.1.2.8. Isolate PPE components until level of contamination is determined and
potential for decontamination and re-use is established. Discard items that cannot be
effectively cleaned (e.g. filters, gloves). Also it may not be possible to completely
remove persistent contaminants from PAPR belts. Consult with Bioenvironmental
Engineering to determine which items can be effectively cleaned for re-use.

   A.4.7.1.3. Personnel should then move to the ambulatory lane and remove scrubs,
   undergarments, etc., and place them in plastic bag. Double bag all clothing and label bags
   appropriately

   A.4.7.1.4. Complete showering process, dry off and dress in replacement clothing, scrubs,
   etc.

   A.4.7.1.5. Complete post operation medical assess and document

A.4.7.2. Work-Rest Cycle

A.4.7.2.1. Buddy wash in the litter lane

A.4.7.2.2. Personnel then go to designated rest area, i.e. shaded and out-of-the-way (but not in
       the MTF). Recommend a pop-up cover of some type if a shaded area isn’t available in
       the designated medical decon zone. Should also include chairs as well as fans or air
       conditioning if possible.

A.4.7.2.3. Peel hood off and turn off PAPR; then unzip suit to allow for cooling

A.4.7.2.4. Personnel should then rehydrate

A.4.7.3. Staff Personnel in Distress
188                                                        AFTTP 3-42.32 15 OCTOBER 2013

A.4.7.3.1. If staff member becomes distressed, other staff members should assist immediately
A.4.7.3.2. Decontaminate member’s PPE with soap and water in the litter lane (may need to
       place member on backboard – consider treating member as an immediate Triage patient)

A.4.7.3.3. Quickly remove PPE in a head-to-toe fashion (cut PPE off if necessary), and render
       medical care as needed

A.4.7.3.4. Bag all PPE items and discard as appropriate following the same guidelines as above
       for end of event or shift

A.4.8. Management of Heat Stress and Other Potential Health Issues. The day of the
response event, all personnel should undergo a medical assessment before putting the PPE on
and performing patient decon duties, as well as at the conclusion of the event with this data being
recorded on a medical surveillance form (refer to the OSHA Best Practice guide for a couple of
examples). At a minimum personnel should be assessed to determine if they are pregnant, on
medication for upper respiratory illness, have symptoms of illness, have open sores, rash or
sunburn, or irregular heart rate or rhythm. If time permits, the assessment should also include
checking blood pressure, pulse rate, respiration rate and temperature with member being
excluded if the following levels are exceeded:

       A.4.8.1. Blood Pressure (Diastolic) = >105

       A.4.8.2. Pulse Rate = > [70% (220 – age0]

IAW AFI 41-106, MCRP team chiefs must ensure MC-CBRN allowance standards are operationally maintained IAW AFI 41-
209. Units are not expected to develop separate teams for MCRP and MC-CBRN operations.

IAW AFI 41-209, medical unit commanders appoint a team leader for each MC-CBRN assemblage and ensure assigned
assemblages are established and maintained. Team leaders ensure inventories of their assemblages are completed and provide
input for annual budget submissions. Team property custodians use information system products and reports to manage materiel
and conduct inventories.
