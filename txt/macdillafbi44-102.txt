1. General.
   1.1. The PAD program provides for education of the use and placement of Automated External
   Defibrillators (AED) throughout the base.
   1.2. The American Heart Association (AHA) set forth recommendations to establish a PAD program
   in areas where the frequency of cardiac arrest maintains a reasonable probability for its use at least
   once in a 5 year period. The AHA further established recommendations for placement of an AED in
   locations where Emergency Medical Services (EMS) call-to-shock time of less than 5 minutes may
   not be achieved.

2. Responsibilities.
   2.1. 6th Air Mobility Wing Commander (6 AMW/CC): 6 AMW/CC has overall responsibility for the
   PAD program, and directs the 6th Medical Group Commander (6 MDG/CC) (Director of Base Medi-
   cal Services) for implementation of the program.

    gram, provides guidance for program administration, and appoints a Medical Director and Program
    Coordinator.
    2.3. Medical Director: The Medical Director provides oversight for training, emergency medical ser-
    vices coordination, protocols, and quality assurance for use of the AED. The Medical Director will

    The Program Coordinator works in concert with the Medical Director to address medical oversight
    issues and any irregularities that arise. He/She organizes and oversees all training for personnel in
    areas where AEDs are available. The Program Coordinator will also coordinate the purchase of AEDs
    to ensure AEDs are the same as the other AEDs on base and serve as the point of contact for site coor-
    dinators.
    2.5. Site Coordinators. Units possessing an AED will have a primary and alternate Site Coordinator
    appointed in writing by the unit commander. Site Coordinators will be responsible for AED inspec-
    tions and maintenance in accordance with manufacturer’s manual. The Site Coordinator will also
    ensure AED is placed in locations that will maximize ease of obtaining for use in an emergency and to
    ensure all personnel are aware of its placement. Site Coordinators will be, at a minimum, trained in
    BLS.
    2.6. Targeted Responders. Targeted responders are personnel designated by the Site Coordinator as
    those likely to be in the vicinity of the AED unit when a victim is in need.

       AHA Heartsaver AED course and receive a certification card. Certification must be renewed
       every 2 years. Currency of the certifications is the responsibility of the Site Coordinator.

    3.1. The 6th Medical Support Squadron, Biomedical Equipment Repair (6 MDSS/SGSLE, DSN
    651-9620/ Commercial 813-827-9620), will serve as the point of contact for Site Coordinators and the
    manufacturer representatives concerning any problems or technical questions regarding approved
    AEDs. Additionally, 6 MDSS/SGSLE will be responsible for any inspections or maintenance beyond
    the Site Coordinator’s technical ability.
