1. Initiation of a Report of Survey (ROS).
     1.1. Unit commanders (also referred to as the Responsible Officer or RO or Agency Chief)
     must initiate an ROS within 15 calendar days (45 calendar days for Air Force Reserve
     units) of the discovery of loss or damage. IAW AFMAN 23-220, paragraph 10.1.1. A.7., if
     delays occur in the initiating or processing of a Department of Defense (DD) Form 200,
     Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss, a written explanation of the reason for the
     delay is required. An E-mail from the RO/Agency Chief to the ROS Program Manager (PM)
     will suffice.
        1.1.1. Initiation consists of appointing an Investigating Officer (IO) and receiving a
        control number from the ROS PM. Appointment letters must be a digitally signed or a
        scanned wet-signed document. A sample letter, including all required information, is
        available on the 22d Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) SharePoint or can be provided
        by the ROS PM. Forward the letter, via e-mail, to the ROS PM.
        1.1.2. The IO will be an officer, senior noncommissioned officer (E-7 or above), or
        civilian employee in grades GS-7, WG-9, WL-5 or WS-1 or above.
        1.1.3. If feasible, the IO will be from a different work center and senior in rank to the
        individual(s) being investigated. When the IO is not senior in rank or grade to the
        individual being investigated, the person who appointed the IO will advise the appointing
        authority, in writing, as to why this was necessary. This document will be made a part of
        the ROS file as an exhibit.
        1.1.4. The IO must be a disinterested, impartial individual who has no interest or
        involvement in the custodianship, care, accountability or safe keeping of the property in
        question.
        1.1.5. The IO, when appointed, must not be scheduled for deployment, retirement or
        separation within 60 calendar days of appointment. This should allow ample time for the
        IO to complete the report and be available for any follow-up requests if needed.
        1.1.6. Once appointed, the IO must contact the ROS PM to receive a briefing prior to
        conducting the investigation. The PM will assign a control number and provide an
        electronic version of the DD Form 200 and Air Force (AF) Information Management
        Tool (IMT) 1168, Statement of Suspect/Witness/Complainant. If an IO has conducted an
        investigation within the last 12 months, a briefing is not required; simply forward the IO
        appointment letter to the PM to receive a control number, DD Form 200 and AF IMT
        1168.
            1.1.7.1. The IO has 30 calendar days to complete the investigation and fill out Blocks
            9-11 and ensure Block 12 is filled out and signed by the RO/Agency Chief. Air
            Force Reserve units have 100 calendar days to complete Blocks 9-17, as
            applicable. IAW AFMAN 23-220, paragraph 10.1.1. A.7., if delays occur in the
MCCONNELLAFBI23-220 25 NOVEMBER 2014                                                            3


          initiating or processing of a DD Form 200, a written explanation of the reason for the
          delay is required. An e-mail from the RO/Agency Chief to the ROS PM will suffice.
   1.2. When a member is being considered for separation under the provision of Air Force
   Instruction (AFI) 36-3208, Administrative Separation for Airmen, the RO/Agency Chief must
   initiate actions to ensure proper accountability of government property in the individual’s
   possession. The action must be completed while the 22 ARW/Judge Advocate (JA) is
   conducting legal review of the basis for AFI 36-3208 discharge.
       1.2.1. Other than instances mentioned in paragraph 1.2. above, clearance through
       applicable units must be accomplished no less than 45 days prior to final out-processing
       date to allow ample time to initiate and complete an ROS investigation/reimburse the
       government for any lost or damaged property.
2. Documentation Requirements.
   2.1. ROSs are accomplished using an electronic version of the DD Form 200. This form is
   digitally signed and routed via e-mail, SharePoint or Task Management Tool (TMT) and,
   when required, accompanied by an electronic version of an AF IMT 1768, Staff Summary
   Sheet (E-SSS).
       2.1.1. An AF IMT 1768 is not required when submitting the completed DD Form 200
       back to the ROS PM. When the DD Form 200 is received from the IO via e-mail, the PM
       will create and submit the required E-SSS.
   2.2. The DD Form 200 must be utilized, regardless of dollar value, to authorize adjustments
   to accountable records for Information Technology (IT), Land Mobile Radio (LMR) and
   Personal Wireless Communication System (PWCS) assets. Reference: AFMAN 33-153,
   Information Technology Hardware (IT) Asset Management (ITAM), paragraph 1.2.11.3.4.
   2.3. All supporting documentation must be created as/converted into an electronic file (e-
   File) that can be “e-attached” to the DD Form 200.
       2.3.1. Click on the “paperclip” icon located on the left-hand margin of the DD Form 200
       to attach e-Files. All e-Files must be attached prior to the IO digitally signing the form.
       Once signed, attachments can neither be added nor deleted.
       2.3.2. Supporting documentation must include, at minimum, an IO appointment letter
       and an AF IMT Form 1168. In addition, include all referenced documentation in the
       report. Documentation may include, but is not limited to; custodial appointment letters,
       custodial training certificates, depreciation calculator worksheet, repair estimates,
       inventory lists, hand receipts, etc.
3. DD Form 200, Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss.
   3.1. Blocks 1 – 8 are filled out by the ROS PM. This information is extracted from the IO
   appointment letter mentioned in paragraph 1.1.2. above.
   3.2. Block 9. Self-explanatory.
       3.2.1. If financial liability is recommended, the IO must contact the ROS PM to assist in
       computing the depreciated/useful life and disposal value. This is the dollar amount that
       may be considered if financial liability is recommended. Ensure dollar amount is
       included in the Block 9 recommendation.

       3.2.2. For assets identified with a National Stock Number (NSN), the ROS PM uses the
       Useful Life and Disposal Value table to determine the asset’s current value. This value is
       entered by the IO in Block 9 of the DD Form 200.
       3.2.3. For non-NSN assets, the ROS PM uses the Air Force Claims Center depreciation
       chart to determine an asset’s current value. This value is entered by the IO in Block 9 of
