Chapter 1          Introduction to the Heavy Repair
                   Element
1.1   Organization and     The Operations Flight is responsible for all activities re-
      Function             quired to operate, maintain, repair, and construct installa-
                           tion real property. The Flight is composed of five elements
                           to process requirements in an efficient and timely manner.
                           These elements are Maintenance Engineering, Facility
                           Maintenance, Material Acquisition, Infrastructure Support,
                           and Heavy Repair.

                           AFPAM 32-1004 Working in Operations Flight, Volume 6,
                           Heavy Repair is a guide to the mission, objectives, and
                           management of the Heavy Repair Element of the Opera-
                           tions Flight. The Element accomplishes the majority of in-
                           house large and multi-craft work orders, pest management,
                           snow removal, and all pavements and equipment work. The
                           pamphlet offers guidance by suggesting options and tools
                           to successfully perform the mission. Successful alternatives
                           to these suggestions are encouraged and authorized.

1.2   Mission Statement    The mission of the Heavy Repair Element of the Opera-
                           tions Fight, as stated in AFI 32-1001, Operations Manage-
                           ment, is as follows

                           Heavy Repair's mission is to accomplish the majority of
                           in-house large and multi-craft work orders and all pave-
                           ments and equipment work, including facility renovation,
                           alteration projects, all pavements, airfields, roads and side-
                           walks, sweeping, pest management, and equipment opera-
                           tions and repair

1.3   Objectives           The element has five overall objectives:
                           (1)    maintain, repair, and modify real property;
                           (2)    manage large multi-craft work orders;
                           (3)    perform pavement work;
                           (4)    perform equipment operations; and
                           (5)    provide pest management.
                           The following is a brief review of these objectives and the
                           sections in which they are handled. The first objective
                           spans across the Element with large multi-craft work orders
                           handled in the vertical section and pavement work, equip-
                           ment operations, and pest management handled in the hori-
                           zontal section. Chapters 2 and 3 are an in-depth look at the
Volume 6 Heavy Repair                                                                   3

                                   horizontal and vertical sections; providing guidance and
                                   offering tools and suggestions that can be used to meet the
                                   objectives, thus fulfilling the mission of the Heavy Repair
                                   Element.

1.3.1 Real Property                Heavy Repair is responsible for both interior facility utility
      Maintenance, Repair,         systems and structural components. MRA&C for facility
                                   components is inclusive of fire protection and low-voltage
      Alteration, and
                                   electrical gas, compressed air, and water distribution sys-
      Construction                 tems. The structural capability of the Heavy Repair Ele-
      (MRA&C)                      ment includes the maintenance and repair of building com-
                                   ponents such as masonry, concrete, steel, plaster, ceramic
                                   and quarry tile, metal work, and floor and ceiling finishes.
                                   The ability to perform base-wide locksmith services and the
                                   maintenance of installed security vaults and safes is re-
                                   tained within Heavy Repair. MRA&C also applies to all
                                   airfield pavements, roads, sidewalks, parking areas, storm
                                   drainage, and ground maintenance.

1.3.2 Managing Large,              The Heavy Repair Element serves as the Flight focal-point
      Multi-craft Work             for the management and control of the majority of the
                                   large, in-house and multi-craft work orders. These work
      Orders
                                   orders require:
                                   (1)    advance planning and
                                   (2)    the requisition of supplies not stocked or not
                                          stocked in sufficient quantities in the main store
                                          (see AFPAM 32-1004, Working in Operations
                                          Flight, Volume 4 Material Acquisition)
1.3.3 Performing Pavement          The Heavy Repair Element inspects and maintains the air-
      Work                         field pavement systems, ensuring flight operations are con-
                                   ducted safely and reliably. The highest priority is given to
                                   the inspecting, maintaining, and repairing. Flight facilities
                                   such as runways, taxiways, parking aprons, shoulders, and
                                   associated drainage systems. Within the recurring work
                                   plan, flight line sweeping, grounds pest control, and snow
                                   removal are scheduled and completed on a priority basis.
                                   Other base pavement is maintained according to the short-
                                   term and long-term pavement improvement programs.

1.3.4 Performing Equipment         Managing, operating, and maintaining various types of
      Operations                   heavy equipment and vehicles assigned to the Base Civil
                                   Engineer is another of the Heavy Repair Element's objec-
                                   tives. Special heavy equipment includes cranes, bulldozers,
                                   graders, backhoes, snow removal equipment, and high-
                                   reach lift trucks used in support of work by other Flight
                                   Elements and in direct support of pavement maintenance

                               and repair. Equipment operations is organized and managed
                               as a separate horizontal section, allowing for the flexible
                               scheduling and control of these assets.

1.3.5 Providing Pest           Responsibility for the inspection and performance of pest
      Management               and vegetation control for all facilities and grounds, in-
                               cluding military family housing (MFH) quarters. This in-
                               cludes performing inventory control and proper handling of
                               herbicides, pesticides, and other hazardous materials used
                               in structural, non-structural, and grounds pest control.

1.3.6 Heavy Repair, Vertical   The vertical section handles large, multi-craft work orders
      Section                  consisting of jobs requiring advance planning and advance
                               acquisition of materials. It was created to perform these
                               large jobs without the necessity to coordinate them among
                               individual craft work centers. Because the amount and type
                               of work which can be done is defined, it is possible to
                               identify, on a month-to-month basis, the large-scale work
                               orders which can be performed. Additional responsibilities
                               include locksmith needs.

1.3.7 Heavy Repair,            The horizontal section of the Heavy Repair Element is, it-
      Horizontal Section       self, divided into three areas. Pavement work consists of
                               maintenance and minor repairs or alteration to airfield
                               pavements, roads, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, drainage
                               ditches, and culverts. The second area, equipment opera-
                               tions, consists of the driving and operations of various
                               types of heavy equipment. This is done either for work
                               within the Flight or to fulfill requirements for other flights.
                               The primary use of the equipment is in support of the
                               maintenance, repair, and construction of real property as-
                               sets. Additional responsibilities include managing the base
                               pest control (entomology).

                               The Element is supervised by the Heavy Repair chief
                               whose management team consists of a vertical chief and a
                               horizontal chief. The Heavy Repair chief receives require-
                               ments from the Work Request Review Board (WRRB).
                               These requests are passed to the vertical chief who sched-
                               ules the request and assembles the requisite team to accom-
                               plish the work. Multi-craft work orders can, and often do,
                               require the services and equipment from the horizontal sec-
                               tion. Other work in the horizontal section is usually re-
                               quested through a type of direct scheduled work orders

                                   Heavy equipment is organized as a separate sub-section of

                                   trol of these valuable and, often, one-of-a-kind assets. The
                                   Heavy Repair chief supplies required resources and,
                                   through the Horizontal chief, ensures responsive scheduling
                                   and crew assignments and evaluates the quality of the
                                   work.

1.4   Manpower                     Air Force Manpower Standard 44EO, Manpower Standard
                                   Operations Flight, details the manning for the Operations
                                   Flight. Using the detailed formulas and determining the ap-
                                   plicable manpower ranges, manpower managers can con-
                                   sult the provided Standard Manpower Tables to identify the
                                   manning of the Heavy Repair Element needs.

                                   While some command and base variations may make man-
                                   ning requirements unique, the Civil Engineer formed the
                                   original, typical Objective Squadron, Heavy Repair Ele-
                                   ment template to provide overall guidance on the numbers
                                   and types of Air Force specialties (AFS) authorized. The
                                   first CE Squadron chief master sergeant (CMSgt) position
                                   is earned in Heavy Repair and may be assigned the addi-
                                   tional duty of advisor to the commander. (In larger squad-
                                   rons, CMSgts may be earned in other flights and elements
                                   and provide alternate sources for the additional duty). The
                                   manpower table for Heavy Repair has three entries for
                                   MSgt. The 3EX7X is provided for supervision and career

                                   (MSgt) position. All 3E473s earned in this element are to
                                   be civilian except at those overseas locations where civilian
                                   positions are hard to fill. At those locations, one 3E473 re-
                                   quirement can be a military TSgt or MSgt.

1.4.1 Training                     Manning levels and authorizations are based upon fully
                                   qualified personnel. The appropriate training prior to as-
                                   signment is essential for acceptable work performance.

1.4.2 Enlisted Workforce           The requirement for having a military workforce is to meet
                                   the wartime contingency taskings. Each Major Command
                                   (MAJCOM) has a military strength distributed to each in-
                                   stallation. There is some flexibility in the overall military-
                                   to-civilian mix based on the core AFS requirements (At-

                            the right mix and numbers required to meet specific base
                            needs.

1.4.3 Civilian Workforce    The Heavy Repair Element is comprised of a civilian and
                            military work force which accomplishes operations, main-
                            tenance and repair, recurring work, and modifications to
                            real property. This work force:
                            (1)    provides a higher level of career field knowledge to
                                   supplement the senior enlisted force;
                            (2)    provides continuity and stability at the installation
                                   during contingency exercises and deployments of
                                   military personnel;
                            (3)    has specific duties and responsibilities during base
                                   exercises, military deployments, and natural disas-
                                   ters/emergencies; and
                            (4)    provides training to the enlisted and the other civil-
                                   ian personnel.
                            The local Consolidated Personnel Center and Labor Man-
                            agement Agreement can give specific criteria for each of
                            these instances. Most civilians hired are at the Journeyman
                            level; however; in the future they may be hired as appren-
                            tices and intermediate level employees.

1.4.4 Multi-craft/Multi-    The multi-crafting and multi-skilling initiatives were estab-
      skilling Initiative   lished as part of the DMRD 967. The purpose was to en-
                            hance the organization by gaining efficiency and produc-
                            tivity. The intent of multi-crafting was to create teams of
                            skilled craftsmen with the purpose of quickly completing
                            work assignments. Both multi-skilling and multi-crafting
                            included using military and civilian personnel.

1.5   Matrixing             Productivity gains are achieved through matrixing. Ma-
                            trixing is the movement of personnel within an element to
                            support an identified shortage in a skill level, AFS, or spe-
                            cialized work task. Inspection of specialized service con-
                            tracts is one example where craftsmen are used to augment
                            quality assurance evaluators (QAEs) in the Maintenance
                            Engineering Element.

Chapter 2          Heavy Repair — Vertical Section
2.1   The Vertical Section   The vertical section of heavy repair carries out the sched-
                             uling, ordering, assignment, supervision, work, and evalua-
                             tion of large, multi-craft work orders. In defining the need
                             for this section, Operations Management, adopted the out-
                             look that these types of work orders could be better handled
                             by a single control center.

                             The division of responsibilities within the Heavy Repair
                             Element is consistent with the objectives of the Operations
                             Flight as stated in AFI 32-1001, Operations Management.
                             This reads, in part, "…to accomplish the mission most eco-
                             nomically… provides base support services (i.e., pest con-
                             trol… snow removal…)… Accomplishes work require-
                             ments quickly…[and] Develops work plans to effectively
                             allocate in-service resources including people, facilities,
                             equipment, and vehicles to meet mission and customer
                             needs…"

2.2   Multi-craft Work
      Orders

2.2.1 Definition             The multi-crafting, multi-skilling initiatives were estab-
                             lished as part of the DMRD 967. The purpose was to en-
                             hance the organization by gaining efficiency and produc-
                             tivity while the workforce was undergoing reductions in
                             force (RIFs). The definitions of multi-task and multi-skilled
                             personnel were determined by a group of AF Civil Engi-
                             neers.

                             Multi-craft personnel are defined as journeymen or ex-
                             tended journeymen specialists. The limited journeymen
                             specialists assist other specialists in separate technical
                             fields. For example, a plumber assists an electrician in the
                             installation of a lighting system. The extended journeymen
                             specialists have expertise in one skill area and general
                             knowledge in other skill areas. For example, a plumber re-
                             places a wall-mounted water cooler, reconnects the power
                             source, and refinishes the wall.

                             The intent was to provide multi-skilled teams to quickly
                             and efficiently accomplish work requests.



Volume 6 Heavy Repair                                                                   9

                                   A multi-craft work order is defined as "large" or "small."
                                   Small work orders are routinely handled by a Facility
                                   Maintenance work center. Facility maintenance managers
                                   meet with facility representatives and record minor mainte-
                                   nance and repair items. Whether or not the Facility Mainte-
                                   nance can meet the request requirements from within de-
                                   termines the size of the job. The facility maintenance man-
                                   ger determines if the work can be done with available man-
                                   power and available man hours and with the skill level ca-
                                   pability necessitated by the request.

                                   Large, multi-craft work orders are requests that cannot be
                                   met by the maintenance facility maintenance managers
                                   with the resources available to them. Large requests require
                                   advance planning. Frequently, they require advance acqui-
                                   sition of materials needed for the job. These are items not
                                   currently stored or stored in insufficient quantity for the
                                   job.

                                   By putting all the required resources together in the vertical
                                   section of the Heavy Repair Element, it became possible to
                                   complete the large, multi-craft requests without the need to
                                   coordinate the efforts of individual craft work centers. This
                                   also made it possible, by the advance planning and sched-
                                   uling of these large tasks, to define for customers the ca-
                                   pacity of Heavy Repair to perform the work on a month-by-
                                   month basis. The capacity of the section is fixed and the
                                   length of each job and required resources can be accurately
                                   projected.

2.2.2 Processing a Request         All work requirements, including large, multi-task work
                                   orders, are received from a customer at the work center
                                   service desk. The facility maintenance manager and super-
                                   visor determine whether the requirement can be met
                                   through a direct scheduled work order (a complete expla-

                          Work beyond the scope of the work center is sent to the
                          WRRB. If it can affect a base infrastructure, which most
                          large jobs do, the request is estimated and then sent to
                          Maintenance Engineering for evaluation prior to review by
                          the WRRB.

                          The request is given to the program engineer within the
                          Maintenance Engineering Element responsible for the af-
                          fected infrastructure program. The engineer prepares an
                          evaluation, answering the questions:
                          (1)    Does the work meet the customer's needs?
                          (2)    Does the work affect the infrastructure program
                                 positively or negatively?
                          (3)    Does the work duplicate or negate other planned
                                 work, especially in the long-range plan?
                          (4)    How will the work be done?
                          (5)    Is the work valid? This is a recommendation of ap-
                                 proval or disapproval for the work, by the engineer,
                                 made to the WRRB.

                                   Organizations may differ in how the process of planning a
                                   work request is done. It can also be done at the work center
                                   level or through an organized planning section. However, at
                                   the point where the request is planned and a cost estimate
                                   developed, it is essential a clear understanding of the re-
                                   quest be documented. Coordination with the requester and,
                                   at the direction of the CE, other agencies is very important.

                                   After the program engineer's review, the Maintenance En-
                                   gineer, who is a member of the WRRB, also reviews the
                                   work order and prepares a recommendation for the WRRB.

                                   When presented to the WRRB, the request is accompanied
                                   by the cost estimate and evaluations and method of accom-
                                   plishments by Maintenance Engineering.

                                   The Board, chaired by the Base Civil Engineer, includes
                                   the Heavy Repair force manager who is the focal points for
                                   WRRC, the Maintenance Engineer, and other required par-
                                   ties. The work order is reviewed with particular attention
                                   paid to the recommendations. There are two outcomes: ap-
                                   proval and disapproval.

                                   When the WRRB disapproves a request, it is usually be-
                                   cause the requirement does not carry a high enough priority
                                   or the WRRB determines the work was not required. Other
                                   reasons for disapproval include lack of resources, lack of
                                   available funds, out of compliance based on policies, ex-
                                   ceeding minor construction (MC) limitations, and it
                                   could/would have a negative environmental impact. It is the
                                   responsibility of the facility maintenance manager to notify
                                   the customer of the WRRB's decision, provide an explana-
                                   tion for denial, and, if asked by the customer, put them in
                                   touch with the decision-making personnel.

                                   The Board, when it approves a work order, gives it a prior-
                                   ity, determines how it will be accomplished, and either per-
                                   forms or verifies coordination. If the work is to be accom-
                                   plished in-house, it is sent to the vertical section of Heavy
                                   Repair.

                                   The entire review process, from customer request at the
                                   work center through the WRRB, is graphically depicted in

                                             The chief schedules the request based upon priorities set by

                                   From the vertical chief, the request is passed to a journey-
                                   man craftsman who is tasked with:
                                   (1)    determining how to accomplish the work;
                                   (2)    preparing a sketch and work description, if required;
                                   (3)    preparing a bill of materials; and
                                   (4)    returning the package to the chief.
                                   In determining how the work is to be accomplished, the
                                   journeyman needs to coordinate with the customer and
                                   draw on his own knowledge of methods.

                                   The package returned to the vertical chief contains
                                   sketches; a bill of materials; the customer request; and a
                                   brief, narrative description of the work required. The work
                                   is checked by the chief who forwards the bill of materials
                                   to the Material Acquisition Element.

2.3   Work Order Flow              A planner or work center personnel forwards an approved
                                   work request to the responsible person in operations who
                                   establishes a work order folder containing the documenta-
                                   tion required to authorize work. A planner or authorized
                                   work center personnel plans the work using established
                                   procedures, determines if funds are available for material
                                   purchases, and enters the required delivery date (RDD) in
                                   Civil Engineer Material Acquisition System (CEMAS).

2.3.1 Assigning a Required         A required delivery date is the date the material is required,
      Delivery Date                as determined by the planner, and not a pre-selected num-
                                   ber of days based on the work priority. The firm simulation
                                   program provides a recommended RDD based on past de-
                                   livery time of items on the bill-of-material. Operation
                                   Flight personnel should review this data when assigning the
                                   RDD. By establishing RDDs in this way, Material Acquisi-
                                   tion personnel can better determine actual priorities for
                                   material ordering and follow-up criteria.

                                   The assignment of the RDD authorizes funds commitment.
                                   Funds are moved into memo committed status and held
                                   based on estimated material cost (calculated by internal or-
                                   dering programs). Notification for Material Acquisition to
                                   order material is done when assigning the RDD. This
                                   places the requirement in the Logistics workload package.
                                   Work Information Management System (WIMS) tracking
                                   indicators identify work orders tracked to Material Acqui-

                          Material Acquisition personnel perform required research
2.3.2 Bill-of-material    and firm the bill-of-material. If assets are not available for
      Requisitions        transfer action, CEMAS will generate the appropriate req-
                          uisition documents, as determined by the source of supply.
                          An AF Form 2005, Issue/Turn-In Request (SBSS), a
                          buyer’s abstract, or a contractor operated Civil Engineer
                          supply system (COCESS) abstract will be produced on-line
                          for all items ordered, except those ordered as routine. Rou-
                          tine requisitions are produced during end-of-session proc-
                          essing. The firm summary report and the bill-of-material
                          item listing are also created during the firming process.

2.3.3 Monitoring Work     Material Acquisition personnel build and keep a material
      Orders              documentation folder (MDF). When bills-of-material are
                          firmed, they ensure a copy of the firm status report and
                          item listing is placed in the MDF. Each work order has a
                          material folder that is monitored and in which requisition
                          documents are filed. Minimum documentation require-
                          ments include all store, residue, and holding area issues re-
                          sulting in monetary charges to the work order at the time of
                          close out. The individual who receives the property signs
                          each issue document.

                          When all items are received, Material Acquisition person-
                          nel:
                          (1)    review the bills-of-material and notify the planner
                                 or work center supervisor of the complete status,
                          (2)    ensure all required updates have been completed on
                                 material complete work orders, and
                          (3)    review a copy of the completed bill-of-material to
                                 ensure all required items are on hand and have valid
                                 holding area locations.
                          If the required quantities are not on-hand or locations have
                          not been assigned, Materials Acquisition takes the required
                          action.

                          After completing necessary updates, at least one copy of
                          the bill-of-material is printed and placed in the MDF. This
                          copy of the bill-of-material provides a method for the issue
                          of materials during post-post operations.

                          If the holding area is not located near the work order files, a
                          second copy of the bill-of-material is forwarded to the
                          holding area and a file of material complete work orders is
                          created for the post-post issuing of material. During the
                          creation of this file, procedures are developed to purge it as

                                   work orders are closed. A planner or work center personnel
                                   will be notified when work orders are material complete by
                                   using WIMS tracing indictors or local reports.

2.3.4 Material Review              Material reviews are performed by a planner or work center
                                   personnel according to AFI 32-1001. The Operations Flight
                                   chief and the chief of Material Acquisition document and
                                   coordinate procedures for these reviews. The minimum re-
                                   view should include checks to ensure all items are on-hand
                                   and are adequate in type and quantity to complete the task.

2.3.5 Scheduled Work               When work is scheduled, work center personnel performing
                                   the work will draw the material from the Material Acquisi-
                                   tion holding area. Material Acquisition will process issues
                                   for all materials listed on the work order. When work cen-
                                   ter personnel receive the property, they sign the issue
                                   document and it is placed in the appropriate MDF. When
                                   all work is completed and excess material has been turned
                                   into Material Acquisition, work center personnel prepare
                                   the work order for close out and notify Material Acquisi-
                                   tion.

                                                               NOTE
                                     A work order cannot be closed out in WIMS until after
                                     the bill-of-material is closed out in CEMAS. This edit
                                     prevents Material Acquisition from having excess
                                     material on hand or on order for closed work orders


2.3.6 Work Order Close-out         Material Acquisition personnel run the work order close-
                                   out program in CEMAS for all work orders requiring close
                                   out. This program produces either an interim or final close-
                                   out. An interim close-out notice may require action to be
                                   taken (for example, turn-in of material from holding area,
                                   request cancellation of item from supply or contracting).
                                   Once all actions have been taken, a final close-out report is
                                   produced. The final close-out report shows all items issued,
                                   monetary charges, and total dollar values for each work
                                   center. Material Acquisition personnel will ensure the re-
                                   quired documentation is complete and the person receiving
                                   the property signs the issue document. Upon completion of
                                   required validations, Material Acquisition personnel will
                                   forward the material documentation folders to operations
                                   for final close-out actions.

                                   Operations Flight personnel combine the material docu-
                                   mentation folder and work order folder into one folder

                          containing all documentation pertaining to the completed
                          work order. Material documentation is part of the com-
                          pleted work order package and is kept for the required re-
                          tention period in operations. Documents for direct sched-
                          uled work orders should only be retained if capitalization is
                          required.

                          The vertical chief is responsible for scheduling the work.
                          The availability of an appropriate crew is verified and dis-
                          cussed with the journeyman who planned the work. The
                          journeyman then discusses the schedule with the customer.
                          Once the agreed start date arrives the work is started with
                          the journeyman supervising the crew.
                          Crew — The work crew consists of personnel with a rea-
                          sonably close match of skills for the job. Some variation is
                          acceptable. To attempt to get the perfect match could slow
                          the completion of the work. The number of personnel in the
                          crew is sufficient to permit the schedule to proceed ac-
                          cording to plan. The crew is trained to work together as a
                          team performing multi-craft work. Responsibility is shared
                          and the focus of the team effort is output. It is the responsi-
                          bility of the journeyman to keep in close contact with the
                          customer throughout the performance of the job. This
                          regular contact ensures the job is completed to the cus-
                          tomer's satisfaction.

                          Work Completion — Upon completion of the job, the
                          journeyman returns the work package to the vertical chief.
                          At this time, the work package consists of red lined as-built
                          drawings, a bill of materials, the customer request, and a
                          brief narrative description.

                          The vertical chief verifies the work performed. This in-
                          cludes ensuring the customer is satisfied with the work, the
                          work was performed professionally, and materials ordered
                          for the job were either used or returned to inventory. Jobs
                          should be carefully planned to minimize returns. When ap-
                          propriate, any returned materials should be used on the next
                          job.

                                   When the vertical chief completes the verification, the
                                   work package is forwarded to Resources Flight for capitali-
                                   zation. Resources accounts for the costs incurred on the
                                   job, verifies the accounting codes, and, where applicable,
                                   confirms reimbursement codes. (Reference in AFPAM 32-
                                   1010 Working in the Resources Flight, Volume 3 Financial

                                   Once Resources Flight completes its work, the package is
                                   forwarded to Maintenance Engineering. There, changes are
                                   made to record drawings and the impact on the recurring
                                   work program. Maintenance Engineering also carefully
                                   checks the work methods used on the job for any opportu-
                                   nity of potential improvement (See AFPAM 32-1004,

                                   gineering, chapter 8).

                                   Finally, the work package returns to the vertical chief for
                                   close-out. Once the chief verifies all actions are complete,
                                   the production control specialist is directed to close the
                                   work order. The work is complete.

2.3.7 Regulatory References        In processing and performing large, multi-craft work or-
                                   ders, Heavy Repair is subject to the regulation defined in
                                   AFI 32-1001, Operations Management. In giving responsi-
                                   bility for these orders to Heavy Repair, it defines require-
                                   ments for:
                                   (1)    coordinating the work with appropriate agencies
                                          including the fire Department, the safety office,
                                          base bioenvironmental engineer, and environ-
                                          mental;
                                   (2)    obtaining the approval and assignment of priority in
                                          a timely fashion;
                                   (3)    planning; and
                                   (4)    changing orders if the work is likely to exceed the
                                          approved cost, the scope of the work is changed,
                                          and/or there are additional minor construction re-
                                          quirements.
2.3.8 Involvement of the           The process of completing large, multi-craft work orders
      Operations Flight            involves personnel throughout the Operations Flight.

                                   The Operations Flight chief participates on the WRRB and
                                   either approves work orders or delegates that authority.

                                   The first element to become involved with the large, multi-
                                   craft work order is Facility Maintenance. Work centers re-

                                                                                   Chapter 2
AFPAM 32-1004V6 1 SEPTEMBER 1998                      Working in the Operations Flight

                              ceive the customer request. Facility maintenance managers
                              meet with customers to verify work requirements, process
                              the work order, and estimate the job cost. Work affecting
                              the infrastructure is forwarded to Maintenance Engineering.
                              All other requests go directly to WRRB. The work centers
                              also provide follow-up customer service information to the
                              customer. If a work request is refused by the WRRB, it is
                              the responsibility of the work center to notify the customer
                              and explain the reasons behind the refusing the request. As
                              the point-of-contact for the customer, the work center cus-
                              tomer service unit (CSU) puts the customer in contact with
                              the appropriate decision-makers if the customer requests
                              additional information.

                              Maintenance Engineering accomplishes the following upon
                              receipt of a work request:
                              (1)    a method for accomplishing the work is proposed,
                              (2)    they convene and run the WRRB, and
                              (3)    update drawings during the close-out process.
                              The Heavy Repair Element, in coordination with the cus-
                              tomer, plans the work, orders materials, and schedules, and
                              performs the work.

2.3.9 Involvement Outside     Personnel and organizations involved in large, multi-craft
      the Operations Flight   work orders outside the Operations Flight include the
                              WRRB, BCE, senior base leadership, and the customer.

                              Other members of the WRRB, not yet mentioned in this
                              Volume, are: the base bioenvironmental engineer repre-
                              sentative; the environmental department representative; and
                              a representative from the fire department, safety depart-
                              ment, and engineering.

                              The BCE chairs the WRRB and briefs senior management
                              on the status of the work. Senior base leadership prioritizes
                              their work inputs and participates in the overall work pri-
                              oritization effort.

                              The most important person involved in the effort is the
                              customer. The customer works with the WRRB to ensure
                              proper priority is placed on their request. The customer also
                              works with the Heavy Repair vertical chief during planning
                              and construction to ensure the work meets their require-
                              ments.

Chapter 3                Heavy Repair — Horizontal Section
3.1      The Horizontal              The horizontal section of the Heavy Repair Element has
         Section                     two major sub-sections: pavements and heavy equipment.

                                     Combining pavement work and equipment operations
                                     within a single section makes it possible to perform work
                                     expeditiously, without requiring external coordination.
                                     Smaller work requirements can be performed under opera-
                                     tions and can be internally approved.

3.2      Pavement Work               Depending on the scope of the work required, pavement
                                     work is divided into two categories: operations and pro-
                                     grammed work orders.

                                     Operations are small items of work charged to a common
                                     work order (Collection Work Order Number). They are
                                     usually items internally identified, approved, and per-
                                     formed requiring minimum tracking.

                                     This work flow process is shown in Figure 3, Horizontal
                                     Section Work Flow. Pavement work usually consists of the
                                     maintenance, repair, and/or alterations to airfield pave-
                                     ments, roads, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, drainage ditches,
                                     and culverts.

                                   The collective work order is similar to the direct scheduled
                                   work order (DSWO) (see AFPAM 32-1004, Work in Op-
                                   erations Flight, Volume 3 Facility Maintenance). The col-
                                   lective work order differs from the DSWO in that:
                                   (1)    a separate computer entry or paperwork is not re-
                                          quired for each item,
                                   (2)    work is directly charged to operations, and
                                   (3)    cost accounting is done on a large scale (not by job)
                                          and by class pavement (e.g., runway, taxiway, base
                                          streets).
                                   Larger items of work are performed under large, multi-task
                                   work orders (see Chapter 2). Both the personnel who oper-
                                   ate the heavy equipment and the equipment are planned,
                                   scheduled, and costed as part of the larger work require-
                                   ment.

3.2.1 Regulatory                   AFI 32-1001, Operations Management states that required
      Requirements                 pavement work be accomplished in the Heavy Repair, hori-
                                   zontal section. As such, Heavy Repair is responsible for all
                                   in-house pavement work. As previously discussed (Chapter
                                   2), the instruction also provides the procedures required to
                                   accomplish large, multi-task work orders.

                                   The AFMS 44EO, Manpower Standard Operations Flight
                                   describes the work to be done. It also specifically excludes
                                   above 250 man-hours per undertaking; airfield rubber re-
                                   moval; and marking of parking lots, streets, and airfield
                                   pavement.

3.2.2 Operations Flight            Most of the personnel involved with the process of under-
      Personnel Involvement        taking and accomplishing paving tasks are in the horizontal
                                   section of the Heavy Repair Element. The Operations
                                   Flight chief is responsible for providing the required re-
                                   sources and managing the pavement program by exception.

                                   The horizontal chief schedules and tracks work, makes
                                   work crew assignments, evaluates the quality of the work,
                                   and coordinates the work with the customer.

                                   Other personnel from the horizontal section include:
                                   (1)    the craftsmen who perform the work and report to
                                          the chief and
                                   (2)    the comptroller who charges time to the appropriate
                                          facility or pavement category and accounts for the
                                          craftsmen's time.

                             Equipment operation consists of driving and operating the
3.3   Heavy Equipment        various types of heavy equipment available for pavement
      Operation              jobs and large, multi-skill work orders. Occasionally, or-
                             ganizations outside of the Operations Flight will require
                             equipment and operator support.

                             The primary purpose of equipment operations is in support
                             of maintenance, repair, and construction of real property
                             assets. This includes snow removal, discussed in section
                             3.4, at bases where the climate requires this service.
                             Grounds maintenance is not included. To facilitate flexibil-
                             ity in the scheduling and control of these unique assets,
                             they have been organized in a separate section of the Heavy
                             Repair Element.

3.3.1 Work Flow              Work flow in heavy equipment operations is very simple.
                             All work is charged to a common work order (Collection
                             Work Order Number). The work is identified, approved,
                             and performed internally and requires minimal tracking.

3.3.2 Regulatory Authority   The regulatory authority for equipment operations is found
                             in AFI 32-1001, AFMS 44EO, Manpower Standard Op-
                             erations Flight, and AFOSH Standard 91-46, Materials
                             Handling. AFI 32-1001 provides guidance by stating
                             Heavy Repair, horizontal section has responsibility for all
                             in-house equipment work. Also, this equipment work is de-
                             scribed as operations; thus, defining how accounting should
                             be handled. The AFMS describes work included and spe-
                             cifically excludes:
                             (1)    equipment operation in support of base activities
                                    and
                             (2)    performing operator maintenance on the equipment.
3.3.3 Operations Flight      The majority of personnel involved in equipment opera-
      Involvement            tions is within Operations Flight and almost completely
                             within the Heavy Repair Element. Involvement from out-
                             side the Flight is minimal.

                             The Operations Flight chief has overall responsibility for
                             providing the required resources. The equipment operations
                             program is managed by exception.

                             Within the Heavy Repair horizontal section, the horizontal
                             chief schedules and tracks work, makes crew assignments,
                             evaluates the quality of the work, and coordinates work
                             with customers when necessary. The craftsmen perform the
                             work and report to the chief. The comptroller charges time

                                   time.

3.4   Snow Removal                 Climatic conditions on some bases require preparedness for
                                   snow removal capability. On those bases, where snow re-
                                   moval could be required, Heavy Repair Element's horizon-
                                   tal section is responsible.

                                     Snow and Ice Removal and Control.

                                   Availability of equipment designed or adapted for snow
                                   removal, personnel trained to operate the equipment, and
                                   planning and budget for the contingency are the responsi-
                                   bility of the horizontal chief. Planning for snow removal
                                   would be contingent on the estimated frequency of occur-
                                   rence based on experience, amount of time required to ac-
                                   complish the tasks, and man-hours and equipment needed
                                   to accomplish the task in a timely manner. It is mandatory
                                   the mission or base readiness to respond not be compro-
                                   mised.

                                   All planning is reviewed by the Heavy Repair chief, who
                                   ensures adequate training is provided to employees charged
                                   with snow removal.

                                   The chief of the Operations Flight is responsible for pro-

                          The Air Force pest management mission is to prevent pest
                          and disease vectors from adversely affecting military op-
                          erations or missions by establishing and maintaining safe,
                          effective, and environmentally sound integrated pest man-
                          agement (IPM) programs. Entomology is responsible for
                          developing guidance and criteria on pest management and
                          providing consultation to the Air Force organizations on
                          pest management. Pest management works with the natural
                          resources office to control insects, rodents, snakes, birds,
                          and other animals. A high priority on every base is pest
                          control through minimal use of chemicals; especially herbi-
                          cides and insecticides. The authority for the pest manage-
                          ment program is found in AFI 32-1053, Pest Management
                          Program. The Air Force installation pest control supervisor
                          is responsible for the pest control program.

3.5.1 DoD Pest            DoD 4150.7, DoD Pest Management Program charges the
      Management          Section of the Air Force to "…maintain a large - area, fixed
                          wing aerial pesticide application capability to control dis-
                          ease vectors, pest organisms, and vegetation and to treat oil
                          spills in combat areas, in DoD installations; or in response
                          to declared emergencies and shall provide sufficient train-
                          ing for aerial pesticide application air crews and ground
                          support personnel." (Information on this topic in AFR 91-
                          22 will soon be replaced with AFI 32-1074, Aerial Appli-
                          cation of Pesticides.) Other information on the DoD Pest
                          management Program is available in DoDI 4150.7.

                          1962, it is a military entomology and pest management in-
                          formation database. This automated data base provides
                          support to coordinators in the form of data retrieval and the
                          issuance of Disease Vector Ecology Profiles (DVEP) and
                          Technical Information Bulletins (TIB) for pest management

                                   erational support.

3.5.2 Integrated Pest              The shift in the Air Force is away from traditional pest
      Management                   control programs and toward the IPM approaches. Tradi-
                                   tional pest control was based in large part upon heavy ap-
                                   plications of pesticides, usually, as a preventative measure.
                                   IMP uses regular monitoring to determine the extent of the
                                   problem and emphasizes the use of non-toxic, environ-
                                   mentally-safe means of control. Treatments are timed and
                                   selected so that there is the least possible interference with
                                   natural pest control.

                                   The IMP is a direct result of the implementation of the di-
                                   rectives found in DoD 4150.7. IMP is established as the
                                   policy of DoD. The heads of DoD components are directed
                                   to emphasize IPM techniques; ensure the implementation
                                   of IPM in pest management programs, operations, regula-
                                   tions, publications, training, and certification programs;
                                   monitor pesticide purchases; and bring about a reduction of
                                   its use.

3.5.3 Pest Management              The pest management plan is a key component of an in-
      Plan                         stallation's pest management program. The basic elements
                                   of every plan as they apply to each installation are defined
                                   in Encl 8 to DoDI 4150.7. Installation pest management
                                   plans may be in an alternate format if the appropriate
                                   MAJCOM grants approval.

3.5.4 Certification of             DoD 4150.7-P updates the procedures to train and certify
      Pesticide Applicators        pesticide applicators. The installation pest control supervi-
                                   sor is responsible for scheduling all individuals needing
                                   certification or recertification training. Certification of in-
                                   dividuals is performed by the appropriate MAJCOM certi-
                                   fying official.

                                   Legal authority for the training program is FIFRA, 40 CFR,
                                   Part 171 and 42 FR 41907 - 41908. The implementing

clearance easement --              The right to remove or prevent obstructions rising into
                                   the airspace. Examples are easements over areas
                                   beyond the ends of an airfield runway (approach or
                                   departure clearance work centers). Also, easements
                                   adjacent to the sides of the runway (transition work
                                   centers), clearance for approach lighting sites,
                                   communication sites, etc. A clearance easement,
                                   specifically, does not include the right of aircraft
                                   passage over the land, so the landowner may separately
                                   recover for loss of value to his or her land due to low
                                   and frequent flights of aircraft.

                                   manufacturing plants. (Exceptions are base exchanges,
                                   commissaries, and other non-appropriated fund
                                   activities.)
condemnation --                    A judicial proceeding started by the government
                                   through the Department of Justice for the purpose of
                                   exercising its right of eminent domain. Condemnation
                                   results in passage of title and land to the government
                                   with or without the consent of the landowner, but with
                                   just compensation paid to him or her.
consideration --                   Compensation or an equivalent (such as money,

                                   acquired or promised. This may be the appraised fair
                                   market value of the real property or may include
                                   protection of the real property against loss by fire,
                                   water, or other causes, or any mutually agreeable
                                   arrangement that does not conflict with governing
                                   statutory limitations.

                                   needed to support Maintenance Engineering.
declaration of taking --           A pleading filed with a federal court of law in a real
                                   property condemnation proceeding whereby, on filing
                                   the pleading, together with deposit of estimated "just
                                   compensation" in the court, the real estate interest is
                                   vested in the government.
declaration of excess --           A narrative description of real property that is no
                                   longer required for foreseeable Air Force missions. The
                                   declaration contains an identification of the land, type
                                   of governmental real estate interest, facility inventory
                                   information, recommended disposal dates, re-use
                                   rights, and services, obligations, and outgrants
                                   outstanding (see AFI 32-9004).

direct scheduled work order --     Emergency or essential work generally not requiring
                                   detailed planning, also known as job orders.
direct digital control --          Any control system (HVAC, alarms, lighting, or
                                   otherwise) using entirely solid-state (digital)
                                   components.
District Engineer --               One of the several Division Engineers, US Army Corps
                                   of Engineers, who supervise the activities of certain
                                   District Engineers and are the intervening management
                                   level between the Chief of Engineers and District
                                   Engineers (e.g., US Army Engineer Division, North
                                   Atlantic, CENAD).
easement --                        The right to use the land of another for a specified
                                   purpose. Usually, the owners of the land continue in
                                   possession and may use it as long as such use does not
                                   interfere with the purpose for which the easement was
                                   granted. An easement may be acquired for a specific
                                   term or in perpetuity. An easement differs from a
                                   license because: the privilege granted usually cannot be
                                   withdrawn during its term and it is considered to be a
                                   permanent interest in the property if the term exceeds
                                   one year.
emergency work --                  Work that must be accomplished immediately.
eminent domain --                  The right of the government to take private property for
                                   public use upon payment of just compensation.
Energy Conservation Investment     A Military Construction (MILCON)-funded program
Program (ECIP) --                  primarily intended for accomplishing energy
                                   conservation retrofits of existing buildings. It includes
                                   construction of new, high-efficiency energy systems
                                   and modernization of existing systems. ECIP is an
                                   OSD centrally-managed program.
Energy Savings Performance         Contracting with a private sector company for
Contract (ESPC) --                 completion of energy audits and installation of energy
                                   conservation projects. This provides a method to
                                   acquire energy conservation projects with no AF
                                   resources and without payment if savings do not result.
Energy Management Control System   The civil engineer energy control system that
(EMCS) --                          historically manages heating, ventilation, and air
                                   conditioning (HVAC) systems. It differs from direct
                                   digital control in that it includes both solid state
                                   systems and the older pneumatic systems.
engineers --                       Any engineer in Civil Engineer units to include the
                                   Base Civil Engineer, the Maintenance Engineer,
                                   program engineers, and project engineers.

                                      topical areas as an environmental impact statement
                                      (EIS), but with less detail. An assessment results in a
                                      decision that an EIS is necessary, or that the proposed
                                      action will have no significant effect, therefore, a
                                      finding of no significant impact (FONSI) can be made
                                      (AFI 32-7004).
environmental impact statement --     A detailed full-disclosure report which, pursuant to the
                                      National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969,
                                      (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347), identifies and analyzes the
                                      anticipated environmental impact of a proposed Air
                                      Force action and discusses how the adverse effects of
                                      the proposal will be mitigated. It is prepared in two
                                      stages: a draft statement which is filed with the
                                      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and made
                                      available to the public for comment and a final
                                      statement which is revised to reflect comments made
                                      on the draft EIS (AFI 32-7004).

                                   federal agency, it generally covers a one-time use and
                                   is called a "license.” However, the term also is used to

                                   jurisdiction of one government agency by another for a
                                   definite period. These two uses of the term must not be
                                   confused.
pre-priced items --                These are commonly used items where prices have
                                   been previously determined. This is basically what the
                                   COCESS contracts have been awarded on. The

                                   used to reduce administrative cost and buyer time for
                                   purchasing high usage items such as CEMAS store
                                   stock.

                                   because they manage infrastructure programs.
project engineers --               Engineers of the Engineering Flight, so termed because

                               for an ammunition storage project usually involves the
                               acquisition of fee ownership for the land area used to
                               construct storage facilities and restrictive easements

                               Management without regard as to how the United
                               States acquired ownership. The term excludes lands

value (current, fair, and estimated) --   As used in this regulation, these terms mean current
                                          fair market value or current fair market rental value, as
                                          appropriate. Fair market value is the amount in cash, or
                                          on terms reasonably equivalent to cash, for which the
                                          property would be sold by an owner, willing but not

                                          obliged, to buy. Fair market rental value of a property
                                          is the amount that, in a competitive market, a
                                          well-informed and willing lessee would pay and that a
                                          well-informed lessor would accept for the use and
                                          occupancy of the property for a particular term.
vault --                                  Storage location of base as-built and Base
                                          Comprehensive Plan drawings, so termed because
                                          many bases originally stored these drawings in a vault
                                          for physical security.
wetlands --                               Areas that are inundated by surface or ground water
                                          with a frequency sufficient to support, and under
                                          normal circumstances do or would support, a
                                          prevalence of vegetative or aquatic life that requires
                                          saturated or seasonally-saturated soil conditions for
                                          growth and reproduction. Wetlands generally include
                                          swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas such as mud
                                          flats, natural ponds, potholes, river overflows, sloughs,
                                          and wet meadows. Wetlands may be, but are not
                                          necessarily, located in floodplains (AFI 32-7005).
withdrawn land --                         Public land that has been set aside or designated for a
                                          specific public purpose, such as a national park,
                                          wildlife refuge, or national defense use. Withdrawal of
                                          public lands generally has the effect of segregating
                                          such land from lease, sale, settlement, or other
                                          dispositions under the public land laws.
work center(s) --                         Civil Engineering Operations maintenance teams
                                          organized to maintain and repair base facilities and
                                          infrastructure systems. Depending on the installation,
                                          these Centers can be classified as either shops, zones or
                                          a combination of both.
work orders --                            Work requiring detailed planning or capitalization of
                                          the real property records.
