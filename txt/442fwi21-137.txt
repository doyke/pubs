This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 21-1, Air and Space
Maintenance. It extends the guidance of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 21-101, Aircraft and
Equipment Maintenance Management. It establishes procedures for forecasting, scheduling,
requisitioning, issuing, and documenting time change items (TCI) and special inspections (SI).
These procedures apply to all 442nd Fighter Wing activities that support A-10 aircraft
maintenance. Supervisors, superintendents, and flight chiefs are responsible for ensuring
compliance with this instruction. Refer recommended changes and questions about this
publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through the
appropriate functional manager’s chain of command. Requests for waivers must be submitted
through chain of command to the OPR listed above for consideration and approval. Ensure that
all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and
disposed of IAW the Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS).

This is a new publication and should be reviewed in its entirety to ensure compliance.

1. General:
   1.1. Maintenance Scheduling Application Tool (MSAT) is an Air Force standard system for
   querying aircraft scheduling information and reports from base level systems. The system is
   updated each morning by 442nd Maintenance Operations Flight (MOF) Plans, Scheduling
 2                                                             442FWI21-137 26 AUGUST 2013


     and Documentation (PS&D). The information is pulled from reports which PS&D runs each
     morning.
     1.2. PS&D will chair a quarterly time change meeting every October, January, April and
     July to determine maintenance requirements for the next nine month period by Mission
     Design Series (MDS), by tail number, and/or Next Higher Assembly (NHA) by serial
     number (SN). Minimum attendees will be from Egress, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE),
     Munitions and PS&D.
        1.2.1. Forecasts submitted for Cartridge Actuated Devices/Propellant Actuated Devices
        (CAD/PAD) will be for the next nine month period to allow assets to be available in time
        for scheduled maintenance. The first three month period will have scheduled delivery
        dates firmed up at the meeting.
        1.2.2. CAD/PAD requests outside of dates previously coordinated on the local
        spreadsheet must be coordinated with munitions operations at 687-8136 no later than
        Tuesday of the week prior to the week required.
     1.3. For AFE items: only items installed in the aircraft and listed in technical order (TO) 00-
     20-9, Forecasting Replacement Requirements for Selected Calendar and Hourly Time
     Change Items (except for batteries) will be tracked/scheduled in the Integrated Maintenance
     Data System (IMDS), i.e. parachute cutters and survival kit cord cutters. If the item is a
     component of a larger item, only the larger item is loaded in IMDS, not the components (i.e.
     life rafts inside survival kits). The earliest due date of the larger item or installed sub-
     component will be loaded in IMDS.
     1.4. Standard delivery and pick-up time for munitions is 1300.
     1.5. Engine Management will forecast, schedule, requisition, and defer engine TCIs IAW
     applicable instructions.
     1.6. Work centers will notify PS&D whenever a TCI is removed in IMDS by maintenance
     data collection for any reason other than time change. This will allow for correction of
     installation date in IMDS to coincide with due time. All TCI and aircraft inspection
     suspenses will be processed by PS&D only.
2. Responsibilities:
     2.1. PS&D will:
        2.1.1. Forecast, schedule, and defer CAD/PAD TCIs IAW applicable instructions. To
        facilitate quarterly requisitioning, PS&D will submit the local quarterly validated time-
        change Spreadsheet, in attachment 2, to the Munitions Accountability Systems Officer
        (MASO) between 45 and 60 calendar days before the next calendar year quarter. The
        MASO submits quarterly consolidated requisitions IAW AFI 21-201, Conventional
        Munitions Maintenance Management.
        2.1.2. Load or change TCI and SI data in IMDS upon acceptance of an aircraft from
        another unit or upon depot return. Ensure data is entered in all applicable data fields.
        2.1.3. Save a copy of the inspection and time change Planning Requirements Report
        (PRA) to an external hard drive weekly in case MSAT and/or IMDS is down.

     2.1.4. Order non-CAD/PAD TCIs through IMDS Standard Base Supply System (SBSS),
     if available, no later than 60 days prior to (but not less than 10 days) before the need date.
     The ordering date should be based on the availability of items in supply. PS&D tracks
     the TCIs and the Armament Flight (ARMS) orders them.
     2.1.5. Ensure long lead SIs requiring outside support are carefully coordinated to include
     all required documentation. This includes 36-month weight and balance, 36-month seat
     inspections, 36-month drogue parachute repack, gun inspections and all inspections
     planned for phase.
     2.1.6. Notify ARMS shop, no earlier than 60 days prior to the scheduled date, to order
     gun TCIs.
     2.1.7. Review and validate suspense screen #128 in IMDS daily. Print snapshot of all
     TCIs, verify information entered is correct and file in the aircraft’s time change folder.
     2.1.8. Perform 100 percent IMDS data verification on all SIs and TCIs for each aircraft
     using MSAT every week to ensure nothing is grounded IAW TO 1A-10C-6, Scheduled
     Inspection and Maintenance Requirements. Troubleshoot and fix any missing/wrong
     inspections and TCIs identified by MSAT.
     2.1.9. Schedule all due/overdue inspections and TCIs for completion when an aircraft
     enters phase and annotate them on AF Information Management Tool (IMT) 2410,
     Inspection/TCTO Planning Checklist.
     2.1.10. Ensure all required SIs and TCIs are scheduled in IMDS prior to publishing the
     weekly schedule. SIs will be accomplished IAW TO 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment
     Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policy and Procedures.
     2.1.11. Request CAD/PAD TCI extensions as required using the Electronic Temporary
     Extension Management System (E-TEMP). Input the following information: the aircraft
     upon which the item is installed, part number, serial number, lot number, date of
