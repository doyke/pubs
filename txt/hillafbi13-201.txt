2.1. Airfield Operating Hours. Hill AFB aerodrome is operational 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week.
2.2. Runway 14/32.
    2.2.1. The Hill AFB runway is 13,508 feet long and 200 feet wide. It is marked as an all-
    weather runway in accordance with UFC 3-535-01, Design Standards for Visual Air
    Navigation Facilities and ETL 04-2, Standard Airfield Pavement Marking Schemes. The
    first 1,500 feet of Runway 14 (RWY 14) and Runway 32 (RWY 32) are grooved concrete.
    The 1,000-foot overruns at either end have a double bituminous surface treatment. The north
    and south overruns are weight bearing for light vehicles only. The runway gradient is plus or
    minus one tenth of one percent. The runway slopes from 4,783 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL)
    at the north end; to 4,789 feet MSL at midfield; to 4,780 feet MSL at the south end.
    2.2.2. Aircraft Arresting Systems. Approach/departure end BAK-12 and BAK-14 systems
    are in place on Runway 14/32. The BAK-12 systems, 2‖ high bidirectional cable hook
    systems, are 2574’ from the approach end of RWY 14 and 2592’ from the approach end of
    RWY 32. The BAK-14 systems, 2‖ high, bidirectional, remotely controlled cable hook
    systems, are 1250’ from the approach end of RWY 14 and 1258’ from the approach end of
    RWY 32. NOTE: Refer to the IFR Supplement for additional information on the standard
    configuration of Hill AFB aircraft arresting systems.
    2.2.3. Heat Deterioration. To preclude heat and blast deterioration aircraft will not be issued
    clearance to taxi into position and hold on the asphalt portions of the runway when the
    temperature passes 90o F. Aircraft will not be allowed to remain stationary on these asphalt
    portions of the runway. Aircraft requiring vertical takeoff and landing will not position rear
    thrust directors downward toward any asphalt portion of the runway.
    2.2.4. Aircraft Turns on Runway. To preclude abrasions and deterioration of the surface C-
    130 or larger aircraft will not be allowed to make 180° turns on the asphalt portions of the
    runway.
    2.2.5. Runway surface condition and/or runway condition reading (RCR) values will be
    determined by Airfield Management and disseminated through Airfield Management
    Operations (AM Ops). When runway braking action reports are received from pilots or the
    airport management which include the terms "fair," "poor," or "nil" or whenever weather
    conditions are conducive to deteriorating or rapidly changing runway conditions, include on
    the Automated Terminal Information System (ATIS) broadcast the statement "Braking
    Action Advisories are in effect."
2.3. Standard Runway Distance Markers. Markers are located every 1,000 feet along the
length of the runway and 75 feet from the white side stripes of the runway. The distance markers
are lighted and indicate remaining distance in thousands of feet.
2.4. Taxiways.
HILLAFBI13-201 1 APRIL 2009                                                                      7


   2.4.1. Taxiway (TWY) Lettering. Taxiways are lettered from north to south as shown in
   Attachment 2. All taxiways are 75-feet wide with 25-foot shoulders except the south end of
   TWY Alpha and all of TWY Charlie which have 50-foot shoulders. The Alert TWY is 50
   feet wide and has 50-foot shoulders.
2.5. Airfield Lighting.
   2.5.1. Operation of Lights. Operational control of airfield lighting systems is the
   responsibility of Tower. The lights will be operated in accordance with FAAO 7110.65, Air
   Traffic Control.
   2.5.2. Airport Beacon. The airport beacon is on top of Building 225. Building 225 is the
   hangar located approximately midfield, 1,600 feet west of RWY14/32. The airport beacon
   will be lit when the airfield is open during hours of darkness and during daylight hours when
   the reported ceiling or visibility is below Visual Flight Rule (VFR) minimums.
   2.5.3. Runway/Taxiway Lights. Standard blue lights are on all taxiways and standard white
   lights are on the runway.
       2.5.3.1. RWY 14 lighting consists of high intensity runway lights (HIRL); US Standard
       Approach Light System (ALSF-2) (2,422 feet long) with sequence flashing lights, flush
       mounted threshold lights, and Runway End Identifier Lights (REIL). RWY 32 has HIRL,
       REIL, threshold lights, and an Omi- Directional Approach Lighting System (ODALS,
       non-standard).
          2.5.3.1.1. Tower is responsible for the control of the runway critical area lights (wig
          wags).
       2.5.3.2. Runway lights. To provide current runway visual range (RVR) information the
       runway lights will normally be turned on no later than 10 minutes prior to a scheduled
       aircraft arrival/departure during daylight hours when the prevailing visibility is 1 mile or
       less. Precision Approach Path Indicator lights are located on approach left side of RWY
       14/32.
       2.5.3.3. Operation of the Hill AFB airfield lighting system may be reduced as a part of
       the base- wide energy conservation program. After the completion of scheduled tenant
       unit flying operations airfield lighting will be turned off between sunset and sunrise
       except in the interest of safety or when operations require use, i.e. aircraft
       arrivals/departures, airfield lighting checks, snow removal operations, etc.
          2.5.3.3.1. Arriving aircraft: Lights will be turned on before an instrument flight rule
          (IFR) aircraft begins final approach, or a VFR aircraft enters the Class D airspace. For
          landing aircraft, runway lights will remain on until the aircraft is off the runway.
          Taxiway lights shall remain on until the aircraft is in parking.
          2.5.3.3.2. Departing aircraft: Lights will be turned on before an aircraft taxies for
          takeoff and remain on until the aircraft has left the Class D airspace.
       2.5.3.4. In the event the Tower is closed and airfield lighting is needed for snow removal
       operations Snow 1 (snow removal) will coordinate with AM Ops for activation of the
       runway edge lights (step 2 only) and taxiway lights.
8                                                           HILLAFBI13-201 1 APRIL 2009


       2.5.3.5. ODALS, located at the approach end of RWY 32, consist of five strobe lights
       mounted on the tops of elevated poles. The first light (pole) begins in the overrun of
       RWY 32 and is elevated 1 foot. The next four lights are aligned with the runway
       centerline and are spaced at 300-foot intervals. The last light is 234 feet from the
       preceding light and is mounted on a pole 31 feet above ground level. The light tower
       height slopes at a 1.15o angle and extends through the overrun from the threshold to the
       last tower. The ODALS will be turned on, regardless of weather, whenever there is an
       aircraft executing an approach to RWY 32.
       2.5.3.6. If the Tower is evacuated, closed, or unable to operate, AM Ops will assume
       responsibility for operation of the airfield lighting system.
       2.5.3.7. In the event of approach lighting system failure AM Ops will send out a Notice
       to Airmen (NOTAM) and Tower will place an advisory on the ATIS. NO-LIGHT
       minima are published in the approach plates for Hill AFB.
2.6. Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) Check Points.
    2.6.1. NEOR: HIF 304 Radial at 1.5 Distance Measuring Equipment (DME).
    2.6.2. SEOR: HIF 167 Radial at 0.8 DME.
2.7. Hot Pit Refueling Areas. The following areas are authorized for hot pit refueling:
    2.7.1. South Ramp: Row S, parking spots 2 through 10.
    2.7.2. 388th FW aircraft ramp area: Row A parking spots 1 through 12.
    2.7.3. Hot Pads 6 and 7.
2.8. Runway Selection/Change Procedures.
    2.8.1. The Tower watch supervisor is responsible for selecting the active runway. The
    Tower will coordinate with the Supervisor of Flying (SOF) in the Tower, Clover Control, and
    Salt Lake Approach Control (TRACON) prior to changing the runway in use. Tower will
    advise AM Ops, SOF, TRACON, Clover Control, and 75 OSS/OSW when the runway
    change is complete. AM Ops will inform HCCP of runway changes.
       2.8.1.1. RWY 14 is the primary instrument runway and will normally be used with a
       tailwind component of ten knots or less.
       2.8.1.2. When a tailwind component of more than ten knots is present on RWY14 the
       active runway will be changed to RWY 32 at the discretion of the Tower watch
       supervisor.
           2.8.1.2.1. When the winds favor RWY 32 and/or when weather conditions are below
           the lowest circling minima, RWY 14 may be used at the pilot’s request. Tower will
           advise the pilot of arresting cable status.
           2.8.1.2.2. RWY 14 may be used whenever the pilot and/or SOF requests a precision
           approach in IFR conditions (regardless of tail wind component), traffic permitting.
    2.8.2. Runway arresting cable reconfiguration procedures:
HILLAFBI13-201 1 APRIL 2009                                                                   9


       2.8.2.1. Once notified by Tower of the runway change AM Ops will coordinate with
       Power Production Flight (75 CES/CEOP) during duty hours, or Fire and Emergency
       Services Flight (775 CES/CEF) after duty hours, to effect the cable reconfiguration.
          2.8.2.1.1. If traffic does not permit cable reconfiguration Tower will advise AM Ops
          of the projected time to initiate reconfiguration to the new runway.
       2.8.2.2. Base Operations personnel (Airfield 3) and barrier maintenance crews will
       advise Tower when in position (holding short of runway) and ready to proceed with cable
       reconfiguration. Traffic permitting, Tower will provide runway access.
          2.8.2.2.1. Airfield 3 will normally suspend runway operations as necessary to
          complete reconfiguration at each end of the runway. Reconfiguration may take 10-15
          minutes for each end of the runway. NOTE: Once Airfield 3 suspends runway
          operations, only Airfield 3 can resume runway operations.
          2.8.2.2.2. During this time aircraft in the Hill AFB traffic patterns can expect
          restricted low approaches no lower than 500’ above ground level (AGL). Tower will
          advise personnel on the runway of all arriving aircraft conducting restricted low
          approaches. NOTE: Landing aircraft have priority over cable reconfiguration. If an
          aircraft is unable to conduct a restricted low approach and must land, Tower will
          remove all men and equipment from the runway. Airfield 3 will then resume runway
          operations and the pilot will be given the option to land the aircraft under current
          conditions. Controllers will advise aircraft of any loose cables (a properly tensioned
          cable that has not been tied down is not considered a loose cable).
       2.8.2.3. Normal sequence for cable reconfiguration is:
          2.8.2.3.1. Tower raises the BAK-14 at the departure end of the runway in use.
          2.8.2.3.2. Removal of BAK-12 from the approach end of the runway in use.
          2.8.2.3.3. Installation of BAK-12 at the departure end of the runway in use.
          2.8.2.3.4. Tower lowers the BAK-14 at the departure end of the runway in use.
          NOTE: Refer to the IFR Supplement for type, location, and standard configuration
          of Hill AFB aircraft arresting systems.
2.9. Airspace Definitions.
   2.9.1. Hill AFB Control Tower is responsible for control of all IFR and VFR traffic in the
   published Hill AFB Class D Airspace (Attachment 3).
   2.9.2. Ogden Control Tower. The Ogden-Hinckley Municipal Airport is located 4½ nautical
   miles (NM) north of Hill AFB and has an operational control tower. Ogden Tower is
   responsible for controlling all VFR traffic within the Ogden Class D Airspace, excluding the
   portion that lies south of the common coordination boundary line. Close coordination will be
   maintained between these ATC agencies.
   2.9.3. Common Coordination Area Boundary Line. A line beginning at a point where the
   western portion of the Ogden airport and Hill AFB Aerodrome Class D Airspace boundaries
   intersect; then east- northeast along the common Class D Airspace boundary to Interstate 15
   (I-15); then northeast to a point where an east/west line overlying 40th Street intersects
   Riverdale Road; then east along the line overlying 40th Street to the Hill AFB Class D
10                                                              HILLAFBI13-201 1 APRIL 2009


     Airspace boundary. (Attachment 3). NOTE: The Dee Events Center, which is visible from
     both Ogden and Hill AFB towers, is a suitable landmark for the common coordination
     boundary line.
     2.9.4. Hill Arrival Corridor (HAC). The HAC is defined as the airspace within the Ogden
     Class D airspace at and above 5,700 MSL that is delegated to TRACON for transition of
     aircraft over Ogden to Hill AFB. The HAC is bounded on the east by a line one-half (1/2)
     mile east and parallel to the Instrument Landing System (ILS) RWY14 Localizer centerline
     (R-318); on the north by Ogden Class D airspace boundary; on the west by a line one-half
     (1/2) mile west and parallel to the HIF 311 radial; and on the south by a line overlying
     Riverdale Road (Attachment 4).

        may be worn if fit securely to the head. Caps with ear flaps must be secured by a
        strap/cord to the head (a headset or ear defenders placed over the cap does not constitute
        a secure means). Hats with metal snaps, fasteners, vents, etc. will not be worn. ―Head
        Sock‖ style attire may be worn as long as it is pulled down around the neck to meet the
        requirement of being physically secured. Exposed hoods firmly attached to coats,
        jackets, field jackets, parkas, gortex, and rain gear will be worn IAW local Safety
        supplemental guidance when within 50ft of an aircraft with running engines. Security
        personnel carrying firearms are authorized to wear helmets with chinstraps secured in the
        aforementioned areas, but must remove them when within 50ft of an aircraft with running
        engines. Construction personnel will maintain maximum allowable distance from aircraft
        without impeding production and will increase vigilance and precautionary measures to
        restrain hardhats to the head when working on the airfield.
     2.13.2. Smoking is prohibited on the flight line in other than designated areas.
HILLAFBI13-201 1 APRIL 2009                                                                     11

        3.2.3.4. Entering Flight Plans. AM Ops has the primary responsibility for entering flight
        plans into the FAA computer system. Tower may enter stereo flight plans on a workload-
        permitting basis provided they coordinate with AM Ops.
            3.2.3.4.1. When advised by Tower that their flight data system is inoperative, AM
            Ops will forward flight plan information on all inbound and outbound aircraft to the
            Tower. AM Ops will also advise Tower if aircraft are programmed depot
            maintenance (PDM) delivery, if known. This applies to all flight plans to include
            VFR.
3.3. Ground Operations.
     3.3.1. Ground Control. Aircraft shall monitor Hill Ground Control Frequency during all
     ground operations from initial engine start to shutdown. Fighter aircraft may switch to their
     squadron operations frequency after engine start but must monitor Guard frequency (243.0).
     Before taxiing, pilots of all aircraft will contact Ground to indicate their intentions and
     receive taxi clearance. Ground will not permit aircraft to taxi until verification of a filed
     flight plan has been made with AM Ops. Ground may confirm with the SOF that a local
     aircraft is authorized to taxi, but the aircraft will not be cleared for takeoff without a flight
     plan on file with AM Ops. Forest Service aircraft will be allowed to perform engine run-ups
     and reposition on the Forest Service portion of the Alert Ramp during fire fighting operations
     without prior coordination with AM Ops. NOTE: Tower may verify flight plans through
     Air Traffic Logging Automated System (ATLAS).
     3.3.2. 388 FW Command and Control. To assist the 388 FW in their command and control
     Tower will notify the 388 OG if the SOF is not in the Tower 30 minutes prior to a proposed
     departure. Notification procedures will be accomplished in the following sequence: NOTE:
     Unless otherwise notified these procedures shall not apply during weekend (Sat and Sun)
     flying.
        3.3.2.1. Notify the HCCP if the SOF is not in the tower and request HCCP contact the
        388 OG. Notify flights prior to taxi that a SOF is not in the Tower.
        3.3.2.2. Provide a blanket broadcast on ground and tower frequencies after the SOF is on
        duty in the Tower.
     3.3.3. Aircraft Clearance. To reduce the potential for violations of aircraft and vehicular
     traffic clearance criteria at the north side of Building 1, Transient Alert (TA) and ground will
     ensure:
        3.3.3.1. Aircraft taxiing with the intent to park on the North Ramp will be marshaled or
        have a ―follow me‖ vehicle to direct the aircraft to its parking spot.
     3.3.4. Vehicles towing aircraft on any taxiway will contact ground for permission prior to
     moving the aircraft. Vehicles towing aircraft will maintain the required distance of 25 feet
     from any obstacle.
     3.3.5. To reduce foreign object debris (FOD) potential, all aircraft are requested to taxi at the
     minimum power setting required for taxi operations. ―Heavy‖ aircraft are requested to taxi
     with outboard engines off or at idle, if able.
HILLAFBI13-201 1 APRIL 2009                                                                     15


3.4. Local Aircraft Priorities. Aircraft priorities are in accordance with FAAO 7110.65,
followed by local aircraft priorities approved by the 75 ABW/CC. The following preferential
handling will be used when feasible:
   3.4.1. Aircraft in distress (Emergencies).
   3.4.2. Active scrambles.
   3.4.3. Life Guard (civilian air ambulance or military air evacuation when operational priority
   is requested).
   3.4.4. USFS fire-fighting aircraft attempting to save human life or critical structures.
   3.4.5. Search and rescue (when performing a search and rescue mission).
   3.4.6. Presidential aircraft and entourage (includes President, Vice-President, or any other
   public figures when designated by the White House).
   3.4.7. Flight Check.
   3.4.8. Zoom departures.
   3.4.9. Distinguished Visitor (DV) arrivals/departures.
   3.4.10. F-16 Demonstration (DEMO) departures.
   3.4.11. Arrivals (aircraft only receive priority on first approach).
   3.4.12. Controlled departures.
   3.4.13. Scheduled range times.
   3.4.14. Other departures.
   3.4.15. Practice approaches. NOTE: The Tower watch supervisor may amend the
   preferential handling of assigned aircraft to meet mission requirements. Aircraft on their first
   penetration and approach will be given priority over aircraft flying multiple practice
   approaches.
3.5. Departures.
   3.5.1. RWY 14 IFR departures depart on a Fremont1 Departure. Stereo flight plans will
   utilize the DEVLN, FALCN, or ZOOM departures.
   3.5.2. RWY 32 IFR departures depart on a Willard1 Departure. Stereo flight plans will
   utilize the DEVLN, FALCN, or ZOOM departures.
   3.5.3. Protection of the 360o Overhead Pattern. Aircraft departing or performing a go
   around, missed approach or low approach will not climb above 6,300 feet MSL until beyond
   the departure end of the runway. If the overhead pattern is active, Tower will advise all
   transient aircraft of the departure restriction.
   3.5.4. VFR Departures. Aircraft departing VFR and desiring flight following will make their
   request through Hill AFB Ground Control prior to departure.
   3.5.5. Intersection Departures. Intersection departures are authorized with the following
   exceptions:
       3.5.5.1. RWY 14. Not authorized from TWY Golf.
16                                                              HILLAFBI13-201 1 APRIL 2009


        3.5.5.2. RWY 32. Not authorized from TWY Bravo.
     3.5.6. 388 FW, 419 FW, and 514 FLTS Departures. All 388 FW, 419 FW, and 514 FLTS
     aircraft will normally take off using standard stereo departures or radar vectors. Zoom
     departures are assigned a single radio frequency for duration of the Zoom. This frequency
     will be at the direction of TRACON.
     3.5.7. To aid TRACON in positive radar identification of all aircraft in nonstandard
     formation departures, the following will apply:
        3.5.7.1. The flight lead will squawk the transponder code assigned with the flight plan
        clearance.
        3.5.7.2. Remaining aircraft will squawk 510X, where X defines the position of that
        aircraft in the flight. Aircraft other than the flight lead shall stop squawk once established
        within a standard formation.
     3.5.8. Departing Flights. For flights departing under MARSA (Military Authority Assumes
     Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft) with another flight the following rules apply:
        3.5.8.1. Each flight within the MARSA formation will squawk the transponder code
        assigned with aircraft clearance.
     3.5.9. Wingman. Wingman will terminate the procedures outlined above after a rejoin to
     standard formation or reaching HIF R250 at 20 DME, whichever occurs first. Flight leads
     will continue to squawk the assigned ATC codes unless reassigned a new squawk by Clover
     Control.
3.6. Opposite Direction Traffic.
     3.6.1. Coordination for opposite direction operations shall include the phrase, ―opposite
     direction departure or arrival, runway (number).‖
     3.6.2. Opposite direction operations will be approved when an operational necessity exists
     (traffic permitting).
     3.6.3. Unless Tower applies visual separation criteria the following separation standards for
     opposite direction operations shall be used:
        3.6.3.1. Arrival Versus Arrival. The succeeding aircraft will be no closer than a 10 mile
        final until the preceding aircraft passes the landing threshold.
        3.6.3.2. Departure/Low Approach Versus Arrival. A departing or low approach aircraft
        must be airborne and turned to a 45 offset heading prior to the arriving aircraft reaching
        a point no closer than 10 mile final.
        3.6.3.3. Aircraft in the VFR traffic pattern will not turn base until departing IFR/VFR
        aircraft are airborne and beyond the VFR pattern base leg.
     3.6.4. At the discretion of the Tower Watch Supervisor opposite direction operations may be
     discontinued if the normal flow of air traffic is disrupted.
3.7. Noise Abatement. Hill AFB VFR departure and traffic pattern procedures are established
as a noise abatement measure. Pilots will avoid flying over densely populated areas, schools,
churches and public buildings to the maximum extent practical and consistent with safety and
HILLAFBI13-201 1 APRIL 2009                                                                         17


mission requirements. On departure pilots will climb to assigned/published altitudes as rapidly
as possible. After passing the end of the runway at or above 5,200 feet MSL pilots will climb as
rapidly as ATC guidance and aircraft performance permit. During a VFR approach, highest
altitude will be held as long as possible prior to final descent to the runway. Transient aircraft
are restricted to full stops only on weekends, holidays, and between the hours of 1700 and 0800
local time, unless previously coordinated/approved with 75 OSS/OSA. For the purpose of noise
abatement, the 151st Air Refueling Wing (ARW) and Weapons Systems Evaluation Program
(WSEP) aircraft are considered Hill AFB aircraft.
3.8. Airfield Quiet Hours.
   3.8.1. Approval. The implementation of airfield quiet hours affects many organizations,
   operations and processes at Hill AFB spanning several major commands. Therefore, the
   event/ceremony coordinator must give careful consideration to the need and appropriateness
   of executing an airfield quiet hour and ensure airfield quiet hours are kept to an absolute
   minimum. Three types of quiet hours are established at Hill AFB: Full quiet hours, modified
   quiet hours, and night quiet hours, all of which must be approved by the 75 ABW/CC.
       3.8.1.1. Night Quiet Hours. Night quiet hours are pre-approved and in effect from
       2200L to 0600L. The overhead pattern is closed during this time. Only scheduled full-
       stop landings, departures, engine runs, and necessary taxi operations are authorized
       during night quiet hours. Aircraft are not authorized to conduct practice instrument
       approaches/VFR pattern work. Exception: Hill-based aircraft may conduct scheduled
       local flying training past the onset of night quiet hours. Transient aircraft may conduct
       practice approaches, during Hill AFB scheduled local flying past night quiet hours, on a
       non-interference basis, and must terminate operations upon completion of Hill based
       aircraft flying training. For the purpose of night quiet hours, the 151st Air Refueling
       Wing (ARW) and the Weapons Systems Evaluation Program (WSEP) aircraft are
       considered Hill AFB aircraft. Their flying schedules are considered part of the local
       flying schedule. All other flight operations during night quiet hours require approval of
       the 75 OSS/CC.
       3.8.1.2. Day Quiet Hours. Two types of day quiet hours may be imposed from 0600L to
       2200L (for change of command ceremonies, special events, etc.)
           3.8.1.2.1. Modified Quiet Hours. Generally, only full-stop landings, limited taxi
           operations and engine runs may be authorized depending on location of quiet hour
           event. Aircraft are not authorized to conduct practice instrument approaches/ VFR
           pattern work.
           3.8.1.2.2. Full Quiet Hours. .Generally, there is no activity on the airfield. Full-stop
           landings and departures are not authorized. Aircraft are not authorized to be towed,
           taxied, conduct engine runs, or practice instrument approaches/VFR pattern work.
           No vehicular movement of any kind is authorized on the airfield and no noise-
           producing equipment will operate.
   3.8.2. 75 OSS/OSA is the office of primary responsibility for the staffing, and tasking of
   airfield quiet hours. It is the responsibility of the requesting unit to fill out the request letter
   and submit it for 75 ABW/CC approval at least 20 duty days prior to the event. Prior to
18                                                             HILLAFBI13-201 1 APRIL 2009


     submitting a quiet hour request the requesting unit must perform all coordination with 388
     OSS, 419 OSF, 514 FLTS, WSEP, and 309 AMXG Maintenance Control.
     3.8.3. Upon 75 ABW/CC approval of quiet hours, 75 OSS/OSA will notify all locally
     assigned units and post a local NOTAM. Only the requesting unit may terminate early, or
     cancel a previously scheduled quiet hour event by calling AM Ops. Any changes to
     previously approved quiet hours must be accomplished as per this instruction. All
     documentation will be maintained by 75 OSS/OSA.
3.9. Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS) Standards. The following RSRS standards
(i.e. less than FAAO 7110.65 standard separation) apply to all AFMC assigned aircraft and
aircraft assigned to:
     3.9.1. Air Combat Command (ACC).
     3.9.2. Air Education and Training Command (AETC).
     3.9.3. Air Mobility Command (AMC).
     3.9.4. Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC).
     3.9.5. Air National Guard (ANG).
     3.9.6. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC).
     3.9.7. US Air Forces in Europe (USAFE).
     3.9.8. Pacific Air Forces (PACAF).
     3.9.9. Conditions for Application of RSRS Standards.
        3.9.9.1. Air traffic controllers must be able to see the aircraft involved and determine
        distances by reference to suitable landmarks (distance markers, taxiways, etc.) for
        daytime and nighttime operations.
        3.9.9.2. Any aircrew or air traffic controller may refuse RSRS when safety of flight may
        be jeopardized. In these cases appropriate separation standard published in FAAO
        7110.65 shall be applied.
        3.9.9.3. Controllers must provide appropriate traffic advisories to aircraft involved.
        3.9.9.4. Aircraft will not overfly aircraft on the runway. Responsibility for separation
        rests with the pilot. Controllers must provide appropriate traffic advisories to landing
        aircraft.
        3.9.9.5. Pilots are responsible for wake turbulence separation when maintaining visual
        separation or operating under VFR. Controllers must provide appropriate cautionary
        wake turbulence advisories in these cases. When operating IFR or under ATC
        instructions controllers must ensure standard wake turbulence separation exists.
        3.9.9.6. ―Same aircraft‖ means same airframe, (i.e. F-15 behind F-15, T-38 behind T-
        38/AT-38, K-35 behind K-35, etc).
        3.9.9.7. All other fighter and trainer type operations mean not the same airframe, i.e., F-
        15 behind F-16, F-16 behind A-10, etc.
        3.9.9.8. Non-heavy, non-fighter-type aircraft operations mean C-130, C-12, B-737, etc.
HILLAFBI13-201 1 APRIL 2009                                                                    19


       3.9.9.9. RSRS between formation full stops (holding hands) are authorized provided all
       aircraft involved are the same type aircraft (all F-15s, all F-16s, etc.). Separation is
       measured between the trailing aircraft in the lead formation and the lead aircraft in the
       trailing formation.
   3.9.10. Non-Applicability of RSRS. RSRS separation standards do not apply:
       3.9.10.1. To any situation involving an emergency aircraft.
       3.9.10.2. To touch-and-go behind full stop.
       3.9.10.3. To low approach behind a touch-and-go.
       3.9.10.4. To ―heavy‖ aircraft (capable of takeoff weights of more than 255,000 pounds)
       other than full stop following full stop.
       3.9.10.5. When RCR is less than 12 (ANG RCR less than 20) or braking action of less
       than ―Fair‖ is reported.
       3.9.10.6. Controllers consider formation flights to be a single aircraft and do not apply
       RSRS standards between aircraft within the same formation. Separation between aircraft
       within the formation is the responsibility of the flight leader and the pilots of the other
       aircraft in the flight (FAAO 7110.65, Pilot/Controller Glossary).

3.10. Instrument Landing System (ILS)/Multiple Approaches.
     3.10.1. ILS approaches will not be available when any portion of the approach end of RWY
     14 is closed.
        3.10.1.1. 514FLTS ILS Equipment Checks on FCF/OCF sorties: If any portion of the
        approach end of RWY 14 is closed or men/equipment are in the localizer/glideslope
        critical areas, rendering that equipment out of service, 514FLTS aircrew may request,
        traffic permitting, the localizer/glideslope equipment be turned on purely to check aircraft
        equipment reception during VFR conditions to complete required check profiles. Aircrew
        may also request an opposite direction ILS equipment check when RWY 32 is in use and
        will be accommodated, traffic permitting. The ILS equipment will not be utilized for
        course guidance during this check. The terminology "Request ILS for Equipment Check"
        will be used with tower. Termination of the equipment check due to traffic will be at the
        discretion of the Tower Watch Supervisor. Upon completion of the check aircrew will
        use the terminology "Equipment Check Complete" at which time Tower will turn off
        pertinent equipment and re-sequence traffic as necessary.
     3.10.2. Multiple approaches may be conducted, traffic permitting, after coordinating with
     TRACON.
3.11. Go-Around/Missed Approach Procedures.
     3.11.1. For RWY 14 operations the Tower will issue ―execute Layton climb-out‖ for base
     assigned aircraft or read the instructions for non-base assigned aircraft on the go. For
     RWY32 operations the Tower will issue ―execute Riverdale climb-out‖ for base assigned
     aircraft or read the instructions for non-base assigned aircraft on the go. All other go-
     around/missed approach procedures will be coordinated by the Tower with TRACON.
        3.11.1.1. Layton Climb-out: Track heading 139 until 0.8 DME (departure end of
        runway). Turn right heading 290, remain within 5.7 DME until passing a heading greater
        than 256. Cross 0.8 DME (departure end of runway) at or below 6,300. Climb and
        maintain 6,500.
        3.11.1.2. Riverdale Climb-out: Track heading 319, cross 1.6 DME (departure end of
        runway) at or below 6,300. Climb and maintain 7,000.
3.12. Unusual Maneuvers.
HILLAFBI13-201 1 APRIL 2009                                                                   21


   3.12.1. Approving Unusual Maneuvers. ATC may not approve unusual maneuvers within
   Hill AFB Class D Airspace if they are not essential to the performance of the flight. Unusual
   maneuvers are defined as intentionally performed spins, vertical recoveries, or other
   maneuvers requiring pitch or bank angles greater than 90° and/or speeds in excess of those in
   AFI 11-202,Vol 3, Chapter 5.
   3.12.2. Requests for Unusual Maneuvers. Requests for unusual maneuvers must be made
   through 75 OSS/OSA and approved by 75 OSS/CC. These requests must be submitted with
   sufficient lead-time to allow detailed review and coordination prior to the time of the event.
   3.12.3. Communications. All communications during unusual maneuvers will be on Tower
   frequencies unless other frequencies are coordinated and approved by Tower prior to the
   flight.
3.13. Diversion and Weather Recall Procedures. The unit SOF will relay diversion and
weather recall instructions to appropriate flying squadrons, Clover Control, HCCP, and unit
aircraft. HCCP will then relay the diversion and weather recall instructions to other agencies.
3.14. VFR Traffic Patterns. See Attachments 5 and 6 for visual references.
   3.14.1. Arrivals. All VFR arrivals, if able, will contact TRACON for initial sequencing and
   advisories at least 20 miles out.
   3.14.2. Overhead Traffic Pattern (Initial):
       3.14.2.1. The overhead traffic pattern for all aircraft is flown at 6,800 feet MSL (2,000
       feet AGL). Aircraft will maintain pattern altitude until turning base.
       3.14.2.2. Whenever the reported ceiling is less than 7,300 feet MSL (2,500 feet AGL),
       the VFR overhead and fighter closed patterns, defined in paragraphs 3.14.2 and 3.14.5,
       will not be flown. The Tower Watch Supervisor may lower the overhead or fighter
       closed pattern to 6,300 feet MSL or direct a right break or crosswind (weather conditions
       permitting).
       3.14.2.3. RWY 14. Aircraft executing the Mudflat Recovery VFR will maintain 7,300
       feet MSL until past Ogden Airport and then descend to 6,800 feet MSL. The VFR entry
       point is a seven mile initial which will allow the pilot to maneuver prior to entering the
       Class D airspace. Pilots will advise Tower of type landing when reporting initial. Left
       break is standard direction for RWY 14. See paragraph 4.3 for Parachute Initial
       procedures.
          3.14.2.3.1. Aircraft instructed to make a right reentry, also known as right-90 or West
          reentry, will reenter initial one mile south of Ogden Municipal Airport at 6,800 feet
          MSL.
          3.14.2.3.2. Aircraft instructed to make a left reentry, also known as left-90 or East
          reentry, will reenter initial one mile north of Ogden Municipal Airport at 6,800 feet
          MSL.
       3.14.2.4. RWY 32. From Mudflat aircraft will continue inbound and turn downwind to
       parallel the runway over Freeport Center (Fly downwind parallel with runway, 3NM west
       of runway centerline) at 7500 MSL. Once abeam landing threshold (remaining within
       Hill’s class D airspace) descend and maintain 6,800 feet MSL. Aircraft will enter the
22                                                            HILLAFBI13-201 1 APRIL 2009


        overhead pattern at 6,800 feet MSL and report initial within the confines of the Hill Class
        D airspace. Right breaks are standard direction for RWY 32.
        3.14.2.5. Unless Tower directs or approves otherwise, all aircraft will break over the
        approach end of the runway.
     3.14.3. Straight-Ins.
        3.14.3.1. RWY 14. On final approach, aircraft will maintain a minimum altitude of
        6,300 feet MSL until 7 DME then 5,700 feet MSL until crossing 4 DME. Non-DME
        equipped aircraft will maintain a minimum altitude of 5,700 feet MSL until over
        Riverdale Road. Tower will advise transient aircraft making a visual approach of this
        restriction.
        3.14.3.2. RWY 32. From Mudflat aircraft will continue inbound and turn downwind to
        parallel the runway over Freeport Center (Fly downwind parallel with runway, 3NM west
        of runway centerline) at 7500 MSL. Once abeam landing threshold (remaining within
        Hill’s class D airspace) aircraft will descend and maintain 6,300 feet MSL until turning
        base.
     3.14.4. Tactical Patterns.
        3.14.4.1. Tactical Initial RWY14. Tactical initial can be flown as either a 2-ship or 4-
        ship to RWY14. Elements will depart MUDFLAT, descend to 7,300 feet MSL in tactical
        line-abreast formation and proceed directly to the VFR entry point described in paragraph
        3.14.2.4. At the VFR entry point a tactical turn will be executed to place the wingman on
        the west side of the formation, approximately 4,000 feet line abreast. After over-flying
        the Ogden Municipal Airport, the element descends to 6,800 feet MSL. At the approach
        end of the runway both aircraft initiate a pitchout. Wingman temporarily delays north-
        bound turn when headed east to roll out on a normal downwind ground track. Tactical
        initial may be flown at 300-350 knots. Trailing elements will position themselves 1-2
        NM in trail of the lead element prior to reaching the approach end of the runway.
        3.14.4.2. Tactical Straight-In RWY14. Elements will depart Mudflat heading east to
        intercept a 7-10 NM final. The wingman will remain to the north of lead in 1-2 NM line-
        abreast formation. Execute an in place 90-degree turn onto the ILS 139 degree course
        and slow to 250 knots indicated air speed. Configure for landing and slow to final
        approach airspeed, adjusting spacing on the lead aircraft. Additional elements should be
        1-2 NM in trail or check to the northeast at Mudflat to intercept the final course north of
        the element in front of them. Descend to 6,300 feet MSL departing Mudflat. Complete a
        visual straight in IAW paragraph 3.14.3.1. NOTE: Tactical patterns are not authorized to
        RWY32.
     3.14.5. Closed Traffic Patterns (See Attachments 5 and 6 for visual reference).
        3.14.5.1. Fighter Type Aircraft. Closed traffic patterns will be flown at 6,800 feet MSL
        (2,000 feet AGL). Aircraft will turn crosswind at departure end unless otherwise
        directed.
        3.14.5.2. Larger than Fighter Type Aircraft. Closed traffic patterns will be flown at 6,300
        feet MSL (1,500 feet AGL). Aircraft will turn crosswind at departure end, unless
        directed otherwise.
HILLAFBI13-201 1 APRIL 2009                                                                  23


      3.14.5.3. Light Civilian Aircraft. Closed traffic pattern will be flown at 5,800 feet MSL
      (1,000 feet AGL). Aircraft will turn crosswind at departure end unless otherwise
      directed.
   3.14.6. Simulated Flame-Out (SFO) Patterns.
      3.14.6.1. See Attachments 5 and 6 for SFO airspace information.
      3.14.6.2. LARAE Transition SFO procedures. Prior to reaching the OGD 256/020 DME
      the TRACON shall approve or deny the SFO procedure. If approved the pilot shall
      proceed to the North end of the SFO airspace via the LARAE Transition. The pilot will
      report entering the airspace at 13.5 MSL (or as assigned) with their request (orbit high
      key or report low key).
      3.14.6.3. SFOs will only be flown during daylight hours (official sunrise to sunset) by F-
      16 aircraft when:
          3.14.6.3.1. Approved by TRACON.
          3.14.6.3.2. Existing traffic conditions permit.
          3.14.6.3.3. Approved by Tower.
          3.14.6.3.4. VFR conditions can be maintained throughout the approach. NOTES: 1.
          High Key altitude is a maximum of 13,500 feet MSL unless otherwise coordinated
          with TRACON. 2. Aircraft hosted by a tenant unit are considered base-assigned.
   3.14.7. Breakout Procedures. When instructed to ―breakout,‖ pilots will climb to 7,300’ and
   proceed directly to the indicated reporting point (as specified by ATC) and await further
   instructions.
   3.14.8. Multiple VFR Patterns. If a pilot requests multiple VFR patterns at the end of an IFR
   flight the IFR clearance is canceled after the first approach.
   3.14.9. Over-flight. Aircraft will not descend below 6,000 feet MSL (1,200 feet AGL) when
   flying over the base munitions storage area except during emergencies, when executing a
   published missed approach procedure under IFR conditions, or executing circling
   approaches.
   3.14.10. Recoveries. Flight lead will squawk ATC assigned transponder code. Unless
   otherwise directed by ATC remaining aircraft will squawk 510X for a non-standard flight,
   where X designates the aircraft position in the flight, or squawk standby when in standard
   formation.
3.15. Radar Trail Recovery (RTR) Procedures.
   3.15.1. Coordination. RTR shall be coordinated with Clover Control or TRACON prior to
   beginning the recovery. Clover Control will coordinate with TRACON for approval of a
   RTR. RTR recoveries to RWY 14 are limited to a maximum of four aircraft. RTR to RWY
   32 are limited to a maximum of two aircraft. Coordination is required for a planned missed
   approach.
      3.15.1.1. Upon receiving approval for a RTR, the lead aircraft of the flight will squawk
      the beacon code assigned with the aircraft clearance. All remaining aircraft in the flight
      will squawk beacon codes 5102, 5103, and so on in sequence.
24                                                             HILLAFBI13-201 1 APRIL 2009


        3.15.1.2. RTR spacing between each aircraft and/or element (an element is a 2-ship) in
        the radar trail recovery flight will be between 1.5 - 3 NM, which will be maintained by
        the pilot.
        3.15.1.3. Aircraft spacing between the trailing aircraft of the first flight and the lead
        aircraft of the second flight will be a minimum of 10 NM.
        3.15.1.4. Recoveries flown via the Causeway Four will have the radar trail recovery
        formation established prior to HIF 270 radial at 32 DME (WIDOE).
        3.15.1.5. For approaches other than the Causeway Four the flight lead will coordinate
        with ATC regarding the location where the radar trail recovery formation will be
        established.
        3.15.1.6. If aircraft are in contact with Clover Control when the radar trail recovery
        formation is approved Clover Control will hand-off the flight to TRACON. There will
        only be one flight plan per flight.
     3.15.2. No Radio (NORDO) Aircraft. NORDO aircraft will squawk 7600 and continue the
     radar trail recovery. The remaining aircraft will be notified of the NORDO aircraft by ATC.
     3.15.3. Radar Trail Separation. If radar trail separation cannot be maintained by the
     aircraft/element then the aircraft/element shall notify ATC and request further instructions.
     3.15.4. Missed Approach and Climb-Out Procedures.
        3.15.4.1. If a flight is executing a missed approach the flight will fly the
        Layton/Riverdale climb-out. Each aircraft is then required to obtain a separate clearance
        from ATC.
        3.15.4.2. If the flight is instructed to go around, climb-out procedures will be according
        to ATC instructions. If the radar trail formation is interrupted each aircraft will obtain a
        separate clearance from ATC. NOTE: The radar trail formation would be interrupted
        when one of the aircraft lands and the others cannot. For example, if one aircraft takes
        the barrier and the following aircraft have to go around, radar trail formation will be
        discontinued and each aircraft will obtain a separate clearance from ATC.
3.16. Distinguished Visitors (DV). Tower will notify AM Ops when a DV aircraft is 20 miles
from Hill AFB, time and traffic permitting.
3.17. Weather/Wind Information. Tower shall issue wind information IAW AFI 13-203.
Approach end wind information will be issued with takeoff/landing clearances. Additionally,
midfield wind information will be issued with takeoff/landing clearances when the reported
midfield wind differs from the approach end wind by 30 degrees or more and the speed is more
than 10 knots. Variable wind information will be issued to all transient aircraft and whenever
requested by the pilot. NOTE: 388 OG/CC, 419 OG/CC, and 514 FLTS/CC have waived the
requirement for ATC to issue variable winds unless requested by the pilot.
     3.17.1. Hazardous/severe weather and lightning information will be disseminated through
     ATIS broadcast. Weather abnormalities shall be reported to 75 OSS/OSW.
3.18. Flight Information Publications (FLIP ). AM Ops is the publications monitor. All
requests/ changes to FLIP will be submitted through AM Ops.
HILLAFBI13-201 1 APRIL 2009                                                                25


3.19. Bird/Wildlife Control Program. The Bird and Wildlife Control Program is maintained
by 75 ABW/SEF. All airfield users are encouraged to report any bird or wildlife activity to AM
Ops. Airfield Management will determine bird-watch conditions. A bird watch condition of
―moderate‖ or ―severe‖ will be included on the ATIS broadcast. Program guidance can be found
in Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard Plan 91-212.
3.20. SOF Duties. The 388th/419th SOF shall conduct operations in accordance with procedures
outlined and published by 388 OG/OGV, DSN 777-3434. The SOF must not perform ATC
functions or transmit ATC instructions or clearances. A person who commandeers an ATC
frequency assumes responsibility for separation of aircraft

                                      LOCAL FLYING AREAS

4.1. Functional Check Flight (FCF) Areas. Hill-based and Depot Status aircraft operating
locally will primarily use the R-6404 airspace in the Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR).
However, any area in the UTTR may be used for FCFs.
4.2. F-16 Demonstration (DEMO) Airspace. DEMO airspace is defined as the airspace within
a 3 NM radius of the geographical center of RWY14/32, from the surface up to 17,500 feet MSL.
     4.2.1. All participating pilots/aircraft:
         4.2.1.1. Must have a certificate of waiver on file with TRACON.
         4.2.1.2. Remain VFR at all times.
         4.2.1.3. Remain within the designated DEMO airspace.
         4.2.1.4. Comply with all requirements of the certificate of waiver.
     4.2.2. AM Ops will NOTAM the Class D airspace closed prior to the utilization of the
     DEMO airspace. The DEMO pilot will coordinate with all flying units on base at least two
     weeks in advance of the scheduled flight.
     4.2.3. Tower will advise TRACON at least ten minutes prior to a DEMO flight.
     Additionally, Tower will call TRACON for release of DEMO aircraft and DEMO airspace.
     4.2.4. When DEMO airspace is active no personnel or vehicles are authorized between the
     eastern edge of Taxiway Alpha and the instrument hold line. NOTE: The ―DEMO‖ call
     sign is only authorized when utilizing DEMO airspace. ―DEMO‖ will not be used for
     local/cross country flights.
4.3. Parachute Jumping Over Ogden Airport. The Parachute Jump Airspace is defined as a
one (1) nautical mile radius circle, based on the center of the landing zone, excluding that
airspace southwest of the eastern boundary of the Hill Arrival Corridor (HAC). The eastern
boundary of the HAC is defined as a line ½ NM east of and parallel to the Hill AFB ILS Runway
14 localizer centerline. Airspace extends from the surface to the altitude of the jump.
     4.3.1. Parachute Initial is utilized during Runway 14 operations at Hill AFB when the Jump
     Airspace is active. From Mudflat, aircraft will proceed direct to a 2 mile initial to Runway
     14, maintain at or above 7,300 until entering the confines of Hill’s Class D airspace, then
     descend to 6,800 or as otherwise directed by ATC. NOTE: See Attachment 10 for Local
     VFR Flying Diagram.
HILLAFBI13-201 1 APRIL 2009                                                                   27


                                           Chapter 5

                                AIRFIELD MANAGEMENT

5.1. Control of Ramp Areas.
   5.1.1. The Airfield Manager (75 OSS/OSAM) is responsible for:
       5.1.1.1. Assigning aircraft parking areas. Parking space priorities are based on the
       assigned mission of the organization concerned.
       5.1.1.2. Evaluating requests for construction of additional parking areas or modification
       of existing areas before submission to the Facility Planning Committee.
   5.1.2. New Aircraft Assignments. Directorates and tenant organizations, in conjunction with
   the Management Services Division (OO-ALC/FMR), will coordinate with the Airfield
   Manager before accepting aircraft assignments or workloads that would require parking
   beyond existing capabilities.
   5.1.3. Organizations requiring aircraft parking will:
       5.1.3.1. Submit written requests to the Airfield Manager stating their requirements.
       5.1.3.2. Unless otherwise directed by the Airfield Manager park aircraft only in their
       assigned areas.
       5.1.3.3. Properly use their assigned areas to maximize current airfield capacity and
       capability.
   5.1.4. Coordination for construction. All airfield construction, proposed signs, or changes to
   parking plans will be coordinated with the Airfield Manager. NOTE: Prior to and after
   working on the airfield, construction and maintenance agencies must report to, or contact
   AM Ops with details of the day’s activity.
   5.1.5. Airfield maintenance to include, but not limited to, ramp cleaning, snow removal and
   grass mowing shall be coordinated with the Airfield Manager. NOTE: Prior to and after
   working on the airfield, construction and maintenance agencies must report to, or contact
   AM Ops with details of the day’s activity.
   5.1.6. Combat aircraft parking areas are identified in Attachment 7.
5.2. Drag Chutes. Drag chutes will normally be retained with the aircraft until parked. AM
Ops or TA will recover chutes inadvertently jettisoned on the airfield. In all instances AM Ops
or TA will advise Tower when jettisoned chutes have been recovered.
5.3. Control of Vehicular Ground Traffic.
   5.3.1. All personnel operating vehicles on the Hill AFB Airfield will possess a current flight
   line driver’s competency card IAW HAFBI 13-202, Airfield Vehicle Control. Hill AFB does
   not allow POV access to the flight line except for special events. During special events (i.e.
   Air Shows) individuals must display a flight line POV pass issued through Airfield
   Management. NOTE: Refer to HAFBI 13-202 for guidance concerning POV passes.
   5.3.2. Tower controls all ground traffic in the Radio Monitoring Area (see definition in
   Terms). Personnel need not ask permission into the RMA but must closely monitor VHF
28                                                                HILLAFBI13-201 1 APRIL 2009


     121.6 or trunking network ―tower‖ net for any instructions from ―Hill Ground‖. No vehicle
     or person may enter the RMA without manually tuning their radio to the tower net or ground
     frequency and all vehicles must continually monitor tower frequencies while in the RMA.
     Vehicles without a radio may be escorted by another vehicle that is equipped with a radio
     capable of monitoring ground frequencies. Permission must be obtained from Tower before
     entering the Controlled Movement Area (see definition in Terms).
     5.3.3. Vehicles operating in the uncontrolled movement area (see definition in Terms.) shall
     monitor the tower net to the maximum extent possible. Tow operators shall monitor the
     Tower net and receive tower approval before towing in any aircraft movement area.
     Additionally, all vehicle operators, aircraft operators, and pedestrians shall visually monitor
     taxiway/runway lights (if flashing, observe the tower cab for possible light gun signals).
     5.3.4. When necessary, hand-held LMR radios may be checked out for temporary use from
     AM Ops in Building 1.
     5.3.5. If Tower observes a vehicle operating in a suspicious manner attempts will be made to
     contact the vehicle. If the vehicle does not respond Tower shall notify AM Ops.
     5.3.6. Vehicles operating in the movement area must stop at all intersecting taxiways. When
     vehicles approach within 100 feet of taxiing aircraft, and the aircraft is fighter size or less, the
     vehicle operator will stop and yield to the aircraft. If the aircraft is larger than fighter size,
     the vehicle operator will leave the taxiway via the most expeditious means possible and
     maintain at least 25 feet wingtip clearance until the aircraft has passed and is 100 feet away
     from the vehicle. Final responsibility for avoidance of taxiing aircraft rests with vehicle
     operators. Extreme caution should be used when driving on the airfield.
     5.3.7. Vehicles that normally operate within the CMA must use rotation beacon lights.
     Vehicles not equipped with beacon lights must use emergency flashers. Vehicles will turn
     lights on prior to contacting the Control Tower and requesting access into the CMA. Upon
     exiting the CMA, vehicles will leave the lights on until the Control Tower has acknowledged
     they are outside the CMA. If radio contact with Tower is lost vehicles will immediately exit
     the runway and proceed to AM Ops to report the failure. Tower will use light gun signals
     and/or flash the runway lights if runway evacuation is required and radio contact with the
     vehicle cannot be established. When the appropriate light gun signal/flashing of runway
     lights are observed all personnel and vehicles will exit the runway, remain at least 100 feet
     from the runway, and follow light gun instructions from the Tower. NOTE: All
     maintenance activities within 100 feet of the runway will be coordinated through the Airfield
     Manager. Power Production Flight (75 CES/CEOP) personnel, Exterior Electric Flight (75
     CEG/CEOE) personnel, and their respective vehicles may operate within 100 feet of the
     runway edge without prior approval by the Airfield Manager. All vehicle operators must
     contact Tower prior to entering and operating within this area. All vehicles will remain off
     of the paved runway surfaces. AM Ops will notify Tower of all individuals who have an
     operational necessity to operate within 100 feet of the runway edge. Men and equipment
     within 100 feet of the runway will be removed for arrivals/departures of larger than fighter
     type aircraft and formation takeoffs/landings. Final approval for allowing personnel and
     vehicles within 100 feet of the runway edge rests with the Tower Watch Supervisor.
     5.3.8. Vehicles operating off paved surfaces or in areas where FOD is present will not
     proceed on the paved portions of the airfield until all tires have been thoroughly inspected
HILLAFBI13-201 1 APRIL 2009                                                                  29


   and cleared of debris (including mud). Drivers are responsible for inspecting their vehicle’s
   tires; this inspection includes a mandatory rollover tire check.
5.4. Control of Aircraft Ground Traffic.
   5.4.1. Maintain contact with Ground Control. Aircraft not requiring de-arm after landing
   will establish and maintain contact with ground control prior to entering TWY Alpha.
   Aircraft requiring de-arm will establish and maintain contact with Ground Control prior to
   taxiing from the de-arm area. Preferred taxi routing will be established by Tower depending
   on ground traffic.
5.5. Clearance of Other Than Air Force Aircraft.
   5.5.1. Civil Aircraft. Civil aircraft using ATC facilities may conduct practice low
   approaches at Hill AFB on a noninterference basis if authorized by 75 ABW/CC. Low
   approaches will be at the discretion of the Watch Supervisor depending on the current Force
   Protection Condition and traffic in the pattern. Civil aircraft are given permission in
   accordance with FAA Regulations, AFI 10-1001, Civil Aircraft Landing Permits, and AFI
   10-1002, Agreement for Civil Aircraft Use of Air Force Airfields.
   5.5.2. Operating Owned or Leased Aircraft. AFI 10-1001 and AFI 10-1002 establish
   procedures for government personnel, operating their own or leased aircraft, to use Air Force
   installations. The 75 ABW/CC may authorize a one-time, short-notice, private aircraft
   landing at Hill AFB. The reasons for a civil aircraft landing include but are not limited to:
      5.5.2.1. Strong crosswinds from Weber Canyon.
      5.5.2.2. Saturated and congested ATC patterns due to a high performance aircraft
      activity in the area.
   5.5.3. Light Aircraft Pilots. Pilots of light aircraft who are authorized to land at Hill AFB
   will be briefed in advance by 75 OSS/OSAM.
   5.5.4. Aircraft Landing Without Permission. When civil aircraft land without permission or

        proceed to the appropriate EOR for de-arming.
        6.5.4.4. Aircraft returning with jammed/hung forward-firing ordnance will make a left
        turn (landing RWY 14) to back-taxi on the runway exiting at Taxiway Echo and will
        proceed to Hot Pad 6, 7, or 3 in that order. Aircraft landing RWY 32 will exit at Taxiway
        Bravo, or if necessary, make a right turn to back taxi on the runway, exiting at Taxiway
        Bravo and will proceed to Hot Pad 6,7, or 3 in that order. When reaching the hot pad,
        park the aircraft so that the forward firing ordnance is pointed at the berm. Emergency
        response vehicles will stage on the North Ramp until the aircraft is pointed in a direction
        that is safe for emergency crews to follow. Under no circumstances will personnel,
        vehicles or equipment be allowed in front of the aircraft until the forward firing ordnance
        is safed.
        6.5.4.5. AGM-65 Maverick and AGM-88 missile procedures:
           6.5.4.5.1. Aircraft returning to Hill AFB with a suspected hangfire AGM-65 or
           AGM-88, after accomplishing all in-flight safety procedures, will land, make a left
           turn on the runway (landing RWY 14), back taxi on the runway and proceed to Hot
           Pad 6, 7, or 3 in that order. When reaching the hot pad, park the aircraft so the
           missile is pointed at the berm. Under no circumstances will personnel, vehicles, or
           equipment be allowed in front of the aircraft until the missile is safed.
           6.5.4.5.2. If EOD determines the battery has not fired (through telemetry) and there
           is no other visual evidence the missile has fired, then EOD will notify the fire chief.
           The emergency will be terminated. The aircraft may taxi to an open hot pad or be
           shut down in its present position. If the battery has fired, the appropriate procedures
           will be completed.
6.6. Request for Deviations. Requests for deviations from the requirements in this chapter, or
for approval of temporary procedures not covered in this section, must be requested in writing
through 75 OSS/CC and 75 ABW/SEF for approval by 75 ABW/CC. These requests must be
submitted with sufficient lead-time to allow detailed review of the request prior to approval/

        7.1.3.9. Remarks (barrier engagement, EPU activation, etc.).
     7.1.4. SCN. Upon notification of an aircraft emergency, AM Ops will activate the SCN and
     relay all available information concerning the aircraft emergency. When AM Ops is closed
     or unavailable (i.e., due to system malfunction) HCCP will activate the SCN.
     7.1.5. Off-base Mishap. When AM Ops receives notification of an off-base mishap (in the
     Hill AFB vicinity) involving a military asset, they will pass all known information to Tower
     and request activation the PCAS. AM Ops will activate the SCN and pass all available
     information. If HCCP receives notification of an off-base incident or accident they will
     advise AM Ops to activate the SCN and HCCP will pass on all known information.
7.2. In-Flight Emergencies (IFE) or Mishaps.
     7.2.1. General. During all aircraft emergencies or mishaps, the 75 ABW/CC, if on scene or
     the Incident Commander (fire chief) will have final authority over the aircraft after it has
     landed.
     7.2.2. Air Traffic Control. During an in-flight emergency, aircraft mishap or incident,
     control and flow of airborne aircraft and those on the ground will be accomplished in such a
     manner to ensure the emergency aircraft will not be jeopardized. Tower will:
        7.2.2.1. Ensure priority handling of the in-flight emergency aircraft..
        7.2.2.2. Minimize disruptions of normal operations consistent with efficient handling of
        emergency aircraft.
        7.2.2.3. Make a blanket broadcast on frequencies 263.15 and 243.0 advising airborne
        aircraft of the emergency in progress, ETA, and any essential information (barrier
        engagement, runway closure, etc).
        7.2.2.4. If requested by the pilot the in-flight emergency aircraft will be recovered on the
        discrete frequency (257.875).
        7.2.2.5. Notify AM Ops if it appears an object has dropped from the emergency aircraft
        on the RWY. If it appears there is a dropped object on the RWY, or the de-arm crew
        reports hung ordnance missing, the runway will be closed to all aircraft, except
        emergencies, until it is confirmed free of FOD by AM Ops.
        7.2.2.6. When notified an aircraft is inbound with hung/unexpended ordnance,
        coordinate traffic to allow hung/unexpended ordnance aircraft to perform a straight-in,
        full stop landing and minimize any possibility of a go-around.
        7.2.2.7. Notify the Fire Chief when an IFE aircraft is next to land.
     7.2.3. Runway Operations. AM Ops will close/suspend runway operations, if necessary, and
     inspect for FOD or damage following the arrival of an emergency aircraft unless the
     emergency was for smoke in the cockpit, physiological reasons, emergency fuel, instrument
     problem, compressor stall, electrical problem, fuel problem, oxygen or environmental system
     problem, communication/navigation problem or EPU activation (see paragraph 7.2.6). Only
     AM Ops can reopen the runway/resume runway operations. The SOF may waive the FOD
     check for aircraft under their responsibility. However, if AM Ops determines a FOD check
     is necessary it must be accomplished prior to arrivals/departures of aircraft outside of the
HILLAFBI13-201 1 APRIL 2009                                                                   39


  SOF’s responsibility. NOTE: The Tower Watch Supervisor has final authority to ensure an
  efficient flow of air traffic.
  7.2.4. Vehicular Traffic and Response Personnel. In the interest of safety it is critical that
  only the minimum necessary emergency vehicles and personnel respond to
  emergency/mishap situations. The following response procedures for in-flight emergencies
  or minor mishaps are guidelines for the Incident Commander to use as needed when the
  Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is not recalled. Should the EOC be recalled, response
  shall be executed in accordance with Hill AFB Plan 8, Installation Control Center
  Operations and Notification. Response procedures are as follows:
     7.2.4.1. The Primary Emergency Response Group includes the following: Senior Fire
     Officer (Chief 2)and Fire/Crash/Rescue. Chief 2 assumes responsibility/accountability
     for these vehicles/personnel.
     7.2.4.2. During emergency/mishap response an entry control point (ECP) will be marked
     and secured by Battalion 1, Blue Suburban with red flashing lights on top and ECP flag at
     the rear. All vehicles and responders not included in the Primary Emergency Response
     Group will assemble at the ECP and gain access through the ECP with the approval of
     Chief 2. NOTE: When responding to an emergency/mishap on the runway, any vehicles
     not included in the Primary Emergency Response Group, after being granted access
     through the ECP, must also be granted approval on the runway by Tower.
     7.2.4.3. When the aircraft must be shutdown on the runway Airfield 3 or the Incident
     Commander will contact the TA shift supervisor and request the aircraft be removed from
     the runway as soon as possible.
  7.2.5. Barrier Engagement:
     7.2.5.1. Barrier maintenance crews (75 CES/CEOP) will be pre-positioned at the
     respective barriers.
     7.2.5.2. If an emergency aircraft requires an approach end cable engagement the pilot
     will advise the controlling agency and Tower will relay this information via the PCAS.
     There are two cables available for a RWY 14/32 approach end engagement (prior notice
     required). See Attachment 2 for barrier locations and types. Aircrew will obtain the
     current ATIS for barrier status. ATIS will indicate if a barrier is unusable or in a
     configuration other than standard operational status for the runway in use. NOTE: The
     cable reset interval takes approximately 10–15 minutes per cable.
     7.2.5.3. If an emergency aircraft requires towing or removal from the barrier TA will
     ensure only those vehicles absolutely necessary to respond to the aircraft are used.
     Normally only one tow vehicle and one ―follow-me‖ vehicle will respond. Tow vehicles
     without radio contact with the tower will be escorted by TA to the parking area.
     7.2.5.4. Extraction of aircraft from runway barriers will normally be accomplished after
     aircraft shutdown. When cleared by the Incident Commander TA will tow the aircraft
     from engaged barrier to the appropriate parking area.
  7.2.6. If an F-16 EPU is activated hydrazine will be released into the air, creating hazards to
  personnel.. If the unit is activated the pilot will notify the tower using the term ―EPU
  activated.‖ The term ―hydrazine‖ will not be used unless there has been an actual spill or
40                                                            HILLAFBI13-201 1 APRIL 2009


     damage. In either case the aircraft will proceed immediately to TWY Bravo or Golf and will
     not be approached until the hydrazine response team has inspected the aircraft for possible
     leaks. Other personnel will remain at least 200 feet upwind and 300 feet downwind from the
     aircraft.
     7.2.7. Departure/Arrival Emergencies.
        7.2.7.1. Aircraft aborting takeoff prior to brake release will be taxied to the N/SEOR, de-
        arm if necessary, then contact Tower for clearance to taxi against traffic. Aircraft
        aborting takeoff after brake release may be taxied to one of the hot brake areas for
        inspection if required. Pilots unable to taxi their aircraft for hot brakes or any other
        reason will follow checklist procedures and notify Tower of their intentions.
        7.2.7.2. If the emergency is an unsafe landing gear indication and fuel permits, Tower
        will assist the pilot in obtaining any desired technical assistance. If the aircraft can
        remain airborne technical assistance may be obtained from the SOF, squadron operations
        desk, home base, or HCCP teleconference (Conference Hotel).
     7.2.8. Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) Emergency Holding. Emergency aircraft
     will proceed to the VMC emergency holding fix over Fremont Island (HIF 263 radial at 19
     DME). Here the aircraft will hold at 9,500 feet MSL or as assigned by ATC and remain
     outside of Class B airspace. Emergency aircraft will use this point to burn down fuel, reduce
     aircraft gross weight, or coordinate with the SOF, unless emergency or fuel status requires
     immediate landing. The emergency holding patterns will be adjusted to maintain VFR
     conditions.
     7.2.9. NORDO and Emergency Procedures:
        7.2.9.1. If possible aircraft shall remain in VMC or descend below FL 180 to VMC
        within restricted airspace, squawk the appropriate code, and proceed to destination under
        VMC conditions.
        7.2.9.2. If unable to maintain VFR proceed as outlined below.
            7.2.9.2.1. When Runway 14 is Active:
                7.2.9.2.1.1. Radio failure within the UTTR or associated airspace. The aircraft
                shall proceed from the assigned working area via the shortest route practical to
                cross WIDOE at 11,000’ and proceed via the Causeway 4 Recovery for a TACAN
                or ILS approach.
                7.2.9.2.1.2. Radio failure on departure. Maintain departure routing, then as

            on the 30DME arc to PEERC then proceed inbound on the HI-TACAN Runway
            32 approach.
  7.2.10. Unexpended Live, Hung, Misfired, or Hang fired Ordnance Procedures:
     7.2.10.1. Policy:
         7.2.10.1.1. The only hung, misfired, or jammed ordnance authorized to return to Hill
         AFB are jammed guns, rockets, AGM-65 and AGM-88 missiles, practice bombs such
         as the BDU-33 or MK-106, chaff/flare, secure 500 and 2000 pound practice bombs,
         or inert munitions.
         7.2.10.1.2. Hung and misfired ordnance carried internally (if the bomb bay doors can
         be closed) may be returned to Hill AFB at aircrew discretion.
         7.2.10.1.3. Aircraft carrying high explosive ordnance not covered in this instruction
         will be recovered at MAAF. If MAAF is closed or unusable, return to Hill AFB.
     7.2.10.2. Procedures:
         7.2.10.2.1. Pilots of aircraft with suspected hung external live ordnance will attempt
         to jettison the ordnance over a designated drop area or on the range.
         7.2.10.2.2. After the release system has been activated or drops have been attempted
         or made, pilots will avoid flight over populated areas to the maximum extent possible
         and return to Hill AFB with ordnance.
42                                                               HILLAFBI13-201 1 APRIL 2009


            7.2.10.2.3. Advise Clover Control as soon as possible after it has been determined
            the aircraft with hung ordnance will be returning to Hill AFB. NOTE: The SOF may
            declare an emergency based on technical guidance.
        7.2.10.3. Recoveries:
            7.2.10.3.1. In the UTTR aircraft will proceed to WIDOE while avoiding populated
            areas and test facilities in the UTTR.
            7.2.10.3.2. Aircraft will make a hung ordnance recovery using the Mudflat straight-in
            arrival if VMC or recover via the Causeway TACAN or ILS in IMC conditions.
            7.2.10.3.3. In VMC, aircraft with hung ordnance and NORDO will fly the hung
            ordnance (Mudflat straight-in) pattern, avoiding populated areas to the maximum
            extent possible. If IMC and NORDO, aircraft will fly a Causeway Recovery to a
            TACAN or ILS approach and landing.
        7.2.10.4. The following procedures shall be implemented for recovering malfunctioning
        AGM-65 Maverick or AGM-88 missiles to Hill AFB:
            7.2.10.4.1. Hold on range for 15 minutes to ensure expiration of battery power.
            7.2.10.4.2. Declare an emergency with Clover Control.
            7.2.10.4.3. If in IMC, aircraft will return to Hill AFB via Causeway ILS or TACAN
            (RWY 14) or Stansbury/Moser recovery (RWY 32). If in VMC, aircraft will recover
            via the Mudflat straight-in procedure.
        7.2.10.5. De-arming procedures will be in accordance with paragraph. 6.6.4.
7.3. Hot Brakes. In the event an aircraft has suspected/actual hot brakes, Tower will activate
the PCAS. The aircraft involved will taxi to the designated hot brake area. If the brakes are
inspected and found safe, the aircraft will taxi to parking.
     7.3.1. Hot Brake Areas are as follows: NEOR, SEOR, and the portions of TWY Bravo,
     TWY Delta, TWY Echo, TWY Foxtrot, and TWY Golf between the runway and TWY
     Alpha. NOTE: The first FCF of depot aircraft by 514 FLTS may result in visible smoke
     from the wheels due to residual fluids on the brakes. Therefore, a call of ―New Brakes‖ by
     the 514 FLTS F-16/F-22/C-130/A-10 aircraft crew to the tower will be made. Smoke
     observed from these brakes will not require action for suspected hot brakes, unless requested
     by the flight crew.
     7.3.2. Hot Brakes in Parking Ramp. If it is determined that an aircraft has hot brakes once in
     an aircraft parking area or hot pad the aircraft will be taxied to an area clear of other aircraft
     to minimize possible damage from a blown tire. If the affected aircraft cannot be taxied
     other aircraft in the area will be taxied (if possible) away from the emergency aircraft.
7.4. External Store Jettison and Fuel Dumping Procedures. External Store Jettison and Fuel
Dumping are in accordance with procedures outlined by 388 RANS/RSO, DSN 777-5072.
7.5. Bail-out Areas. Contact TRACON or Clover Control for assistance.
     7.5.1. Controlled Bail-Out. Proceed to the Hill AFB TACAN (Ch 49) 242 radial/53 NM fix
     at or below 15000’ MSL and eject on a westerly heading.
HILLAFBI13-201 1 APRIL 2009                                                                   43


   7.5.2. Emergency Bail-Out. If ejecting in Sector D, Kittycat Target Complex, HAG
   Complex, or test targets, remain in landing location and wait for assistance/pickup.
7.6. Tower Fly-Bys. A pilot encountering in-flight aircraft conditions which are not readily
discernible by the crew may be authorized by Tower to fly over the runway at lower than traffic
pattern altitude if an external check of the aircraft is necessary.
7.7. Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) or Crash Position Indicator (CPI) Signals.
   7.7.1. Notification. When Tower receives or is notified of an unscheduled ELT or CPI
   signal Tower will immediately notify AM Ops. Tower will also notify AM Ops when the
   signal ends. The PCAS will not be activated unless advised by AM Ops. AM Ops will, in
   turn, notify SLC Center.
7.8. Evacuation of Air Traffic Control Facilities. In the event the tower evacuates, personnel
will relocate to either the alternate tower atop Hangar 1, Tower Simulator System building,
Tower 3rd floor office or AM Ops, at the discretion of the Tower Watch Supervisor or other
competent authority. Evacuation location shall be based on the circumstances at hand and the
ability for personnel to safely reach the evacuation location.
   7.8.1. Wind Speed. Hill tower cab shall be evacuated anytime the wind speed reaches 83
   knots, sustained or in gusts.
   7.8.2. Personnel Safety. The tower cab shall also be evacuated any time the Watch
   Supervisor deems the safety of personnel is in jeopardy.
7.9. Alternate Tower Transition Procedures.
   7.9.1. Local Control shall transmit on all frequencies, except guard: ―Attention all aircraft:
   Hill tower is being evacuated and the airfield is uncontrolled. Maintain VFR and contact
   approach control on 319.25 or 121.1.‖
   7.9.2. Ground Control shall transmit on all frequencies and FM Nets: ―Attention all aircraft
   and vehicles: Hill tower is being evacuated and the airfield is uncontrolled. Remain off the
   runway until further advised.‖
   7.9.3. Flight Data shall broadcast via the crash phone on a time permitting basis: ―Hill tower
   is evacuating due to (state the reason). All parties will be notified when operations resume.‖
   7.9.4. Runway operations shall be suspended until the alternate tower is activated.
   7.9.5. Airfield lighting panel control shall be transferred to AMOPS until alternate tower is
   activated.
   7.9.6. If the digital voice recording system in the primary tower remains operational, all
   frequencies and FM Nets shall remain selected on the electronic touch voice system in the
   primary tower (to provide limited recording capabilities in the alternate tower).
   7.9.7. The following radio frequencies/FM Nets are available in the alternate tower:
       7.9.7.1. Tower: 127.15 / 263.15.
       7.9.7.2. Ground: 121.6 / 275.8.
       7.9.7.3. FM Nets: Tower Net and Crash Net.
44                                                              HILLAFBI13-201 1 APRIL 2009


     7.9.8. NAVAID monitoring shall be accomplished via Remote Status Maintenance System
     software and pilot reports.
     7.9.9. After completion of the alternate tower opening checklist the Watch Supervisor shall
     determine when safe operations may resume.
     7.9.10. Local Control shall transmit on all frequencies: ―Attention all aircraft: Hill alternate
     tower is now operational; runway (runway number) is in use.‖
     7.9.11. Ground Control shall transmit on all frequencies and FM Nets: ―Attention all aircraft
     and vehicles: Hill alternate tower is now operational. State your position and intentions.‖
     7.9.12. Flight Data shall broadcast via the crash phone: ―Hill tower operations are resumed
     from (location, either primary or alternate) tower.‖
     7.9.13. Limitations.
        7.9.13.1. Clearance Delivery frequencies, 124.1 / 335.8 are not available. Clearance
        Delivery functions shall be accomplished on Ground Control frequencies 121.6 / 275.8.
        7.9.13.2. Flight Data System not available. A controller shall be placed in AMOPS to
        relay flight plan information via landline. If a controller is not available AMOPS shall
        pass flight plan information via landline.
        7.9.13.3. Usable frequency range is limited to PRC-113 capabilities. Aircraft should
        expect a reduction in usable range and clarity. Range is adequate for establishing two-
        way radio contact prior to entering Hill Tower’s class Delta airspace.
        7.9.13.4. Due to decreased equipment and operational capabilities airborne aircraft
        operations shall be restricted to departures and ILS/TACAN/Visual straight-in
        approaches to full-stop landings. Airborne aircraft operations in the tower pattern shall
        not exceed four aircraft at any time.
     7.9.14. Tower management, after assessing capabilities, will coordinate with local flying
     units to determine if the alternate tower may support any increase in volume of aircraft
     operations.
7.10. Evacuation of Airfield Management Operations. If AM Ops needs to evacuate, AM
Ops will establish operations in the control tower simulator building. AM Ops services will be
limited during alternate facility operations.
7.11. Helicopter Landings for Life Flight or Air Medical. Prior to aircraft arrival, hospital
personnel will coordinate with Tower, Fire Department, and SF. The primary landing areas will
be the RWY and the North Ramp. If another landing location is selected Airfield 3 or SF will
ensure the landing area is clear of vehicles, personnel, and obvious hazards. SF will ensure
vehicular traffic is rerouted from the immediate area.

those being loaded, unloaded, or awaiting loading. See Attachment 8 for explosive cargo aircraft
parking areas and explosive limitations for these areas.
Assigned Unit—Hill AFB assigned units.
Combat Aircraft Parking Area—Area specifically designated for parking aircraft loaded with
combat configured explosives or those being loaded, unloaded, or awaiting loading.
Combat Configured Aircraft—Any aircraft, (e.g., fighter, bomber, gunship, or forward air
controller,) loaded with ordnance in or on a launcher, rack, gun, or other means of releasing or
firing the ordnance.
Controlled Movement Area—At Hill AFB, the controlled movement area is defined as the
runway, ILS critical area (when active), and those portions of the airfield within 100 feet either
side of the runway edge. Specific approval for entry onto the controlled movement area must be
obtained from ATC. The overrun and underrun are considered part of the Controlled Movement
Area.
Deployed Unit—A unit temporarily deployed to Hill AFB for flying training/operations.
Empty Non-nuclear Munitions—A munitions item or component whose explosive material has
been completely removed, or left out at the time of manufacture, and has not been replaced by
other materials.
Explosive Limit—The maximum quantity of explosives in pounds authorized at a potential
explosion site.
Forward Firing Ordnance—A munitions item that, if fired, would present a hazard to
personnel, aircraft, equipment, or structures located in front of the combat aircraft.
Hangfire—A brief undesired delay in the functioning of an ammunition item after initiating
action is taken.
Hot Gun—An operational gun that, after safety devices have been removed, is capable of firing
when the trigger switch is depressed.
Hung Gun—An operational gun that fails to fire or has a sudden stoppage of fire when the
trigger switch is depressed.
Hung Ordnance—Any munitions item remaining on suspension gear, bomb rack, or dispenser
after an attempted release.
Inert Non-nuclear Munitions—A munitions item or component whose explosive material has
been replaced by inert material.
Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)—Rules governing the procedures for conducting instrument
flight. IFR rules are used when flight conditions are less than VFR (1.3.6). Additionally, it is
used by pilots and controllers to indicate a type of flight plan.
Live Ordnance—Any ordnance with an assigned hazard class as outlined in AFMAN 91-201
and T.O. 11-A-1-46.
Misfire—Failure of an item of ammunition to fire after initiating action is taken.
Net Explosive Weight (NEW)—The total quantity of explosive material, expressed in pounds in
each item or round. The NEW can be determined by referencing TO 11A146.

Non-explosives Loaded Cargo Aircraft—Cargo aircraft, government or contract, arriving on
Hill AFB that do not contain explosives and are not scheduled to be loaded with explosives prior
to departure.
Radio Monitoring Area—Defined as that area within 1000 feet of runway centerline, either
side, and extending 1500 feet at each end from runway thresholds (within the airfield fence line).
Vehicles entering this area must have a radio that is capable of two-way communication with the
tower.
Traffic Pattern Saturation—The point at which the number of aircraft in the traffic pattern
creates a hazard to flying safety or causes undue delay to departing aircraft. The control tower
watch supervisor shall determine when the traffic pattern is approaching the saturation point and
take necessary corrective measures to alleviate the situation by strictly enforcing aircraft
priorities or not allowing pattern work.
Transient Aircraft—Aircraft not affiliated with, deployed to, or stationed at Hill AFB.
Uncontrolled Movement Area—All taxiways west of taxiway Alpha (to include taxiway
Alpha), aprons, ramps, parking areas, loading docks, and any other areas not under the control of
air traffic are considered uncontrolled movement areas.
Unexpended Ordnance—Any munitions item remaining on suspension, gear, bomb rack, or
dispenser for which no attempt to release has been made
Visual Flight Rules (VFR)—Rules that govern the procedures for conducting flight under visual
conditions. The term ―VFR‖ is also used in the United States to indicate weather conditions that
are equal to or greater than minimum VFR requirements. Basic VFR minima for Class D
Airspace are flight visibility of 3 statute miles, 500 feet below clouds, 1,000 feet above clouds,
and 2,000 feet horizontal from clouds.
Local References -—For the purpose of this instruction, Hill AFB ATC Tower will be referred
to as Tower. The Hill Consolidated Command Post (75 ABW/CP) is abbreviated HCCP. The
299th Range Control Squadron will be referred to as Clover Control. The aprons adjacent to
both ends of the runway will be referred to as the EOR; north end of the runway (NEOR) and
south end of the runway (SEOR). Hill AFB tenant units will be referred to as tenant units and
include the following: 388 FW, 419 FW, and 514 FLTS. The USFS is considered a tenant unit
during fire-fighting operations and operates from the Alert Area.
