                         HOST BASE CIVIL ENGINEER SUPPORT

3. 1. The host Base Civil Engineer (BCE)/Directorate of Public (DPW) is responsible for the
maintenance and repair of base facilities occupied by 70 ISRW personnel. The host Civil
Engineer function may be comprised of military personnel only, civilian/military mix, contractor
operated or a combination of any of these. Regardless of the organizational makeup of the
operation at your location, units should learn to operate effectively and efficiently within that
system. Learning and understanding the host’s organizational structure is critical to knowing
how to get your requirements to the right people. It is also important that you have a strong
relationship with your host BCE/DPW and that you are intimately involved in their prioritization
processes. Specific host responsibilities should be spelled out in the host-tenant support
agreement, but the following is a brief list of typical host BCE/DPW maintenance and repair
responsibilities:
       3.1.1. Periodic visits to evaluate total facility-bathrooms, floors, roof, walls, etc.
           3.1.1.1. Maintenance of all utility systems; heating, ventilating, air conditioning,
           electrical, power generating equipment, fuel oil, water, sewer, and others as
           applicable.
           3.1.1.2. Periodic testing and maintenance of emergency backup power systems
           (generators). (Note: Uninterrupted Power Systems (UPS) are not real property and is
           the responsibility of the unit to procure, maintain and repair. (Reference AFI 32-1063
           and AFI 32-1001)).
           3.1.1.3. Security alarms and fire protection systems.
           3.1.1.4. Electrical safety and signal grounding systems.
           3.1.1.5. Antenna support structures.
           3.1.1.6. Perimeter security fence and lighting systems.
           3.1.1.7. Classified Destruction Equipment (CDE) only if recorded as real property.
           3.1.1.8. General Grounds Maintenance.
    3.2. At some installations support personnel are authorized clearances for unescorted entry
    into SCI facilities. At other locations, escorts must be provided to facilitate day-to-day
    maintenance. Ensure access is provided to support personnel when required. Where cleared
    support personnel are authorized; the BCE/DPW is responsible for filling the positions
    allocated to support the maintenance of 70 ISRW facilities.
    3.3. The host installation is responsible for all fire protection and environmental
    management oversight. That said, there are responsibilities that you should assume as the
    site engineer and facility manager for your site. These include fire extinguisher inspections,
    fire drills, fire evacuation routes, ESOH inspection preparation and HAZMAT monitoring.
    Maintain a strong relationship with the host fire department and environmental office to
    ensure you are meeting their requirements.
70ISRWH32-1002 6 OCTOBER 2009                                                              7


  3.4. The Civil Engineer Officer-in-Charge (OIC) should periodically review the support
  agreement (also known as host-tenant support agreement (HTSA) or intra/inter-service
  support agreements (ISSA)). Initiate changes to the agreement as appropriate, and retain a
  copy on file. Document any problems with host BCE/DPW support. Applicable CDE and
  security alarm systems should be included in the agreement. AF ISR/A7CP performs a
  review of agreements at command level. Keep them advised, through 717 CS/CE, of
  problems encountered so that they can resolve problems before the agreements are finalized.

                    FACILITY/SYSTEMS MAINTENANCE & UPKEEP

 4.1. As the unit liaison with the host BCE/DPW, the OIC has the overall responsibility to
ensure that facility maintenance is performed in an effective and timely manner. All written
work requests must be forwarded to the OIC for review prior to submittal to the BCE/DPW. It is
imperative that the OIC has some way of tracking and managing all work requests
4.2. Facility Management.          Each facility utilized by 70 ISRW should have a primary and
alternate real property facility manager (RPFM) assigned. The BCE/DPW is required to provide
facility manager training, but the RPFM should conduct any specialized training necessitated by
local mission or equipment. The facility managers are responsible for the duties outlined in the
base policy for facility managers and any special 70 ISRW requirements. Due to the different
situations at each site, the facility manager program will be run differently. It is the site
engineer’s responsibility to create a facility manager program that works for them.
4.3. Requesting Work: The host BCE/DPW policy on submittal of written work requests can
be obtained from their customer service unit. Since the OIC is the unit liaison with the host
BCE/DPW, he or she will review all BCE/DPW work requests prior to submittal. Routing
maintenance and repair requests normally require coordination through the Base Safety Office,
the Fire Department and the local Environmental Office. At the unit level, always coordinate
with the local fire protection, safety, security forces, and TEMPEST representative. If the
request proposes changes to the special compartmented information facility (SCIF) that would
affect the accreditation criteria, consult the local SCIF accreditation authority before submitting
the work request.
4.4. Recurring Work Program (RWP): Monitoring of the Recurring Work Program (RWP) is
an area of particular concern because of the impact of equipment (Heating, Ventilation, and Air
Conditioning, generator, and power supply) breakdowns on the 70 ISRW mission. The OIC can
obtain a listing of all equipment that is in the RWP from the host BCE/DPW RWP scheduler.
Check to see if the listing includes all equipment that should be in the RWP. Make sure critical
equipment is identified as such. If you feel that a particular item of equipment should be on the
list, contact the RWP scheduler to have it placed in the RWP. To determine if scheduled
maintenance is being accomplished, provide a list of items on the schedule to the appropriate
facility manager and have them advise you when maintenance is performed. If maintenance on a
critical item is not being accomplished, you should discuss it with the BCE/DPW CSU or Zonal
Maintenance Shop.
4.5. Equipment Accounting Classification: Equipment accounting is very important because
it will delineate lines of maintenance, repair, and replacement responsibilities. Real Property
Installed Equipment (RPIE) is government-owned or leased accessory equipment, apparatus and
fixtures that are permanently attached to, integrated into, or on government-owned or leased
property. The BCE/DPW real property office should account for all RPIE items and the
BCE/DPW is responsible for maintenance and repair of RPIE items. On the other hand, Real
Property Similar Equipment (RPSE) is non-RPIE structures and equipment deployed or
permanently assigned to an installation as facility substitutes that support a major command
mission. RPSE is not considered real property, as accountability is strictly in the control of the
70ISRWH32-1002 6 OCTOBER 2009                                                                   9


user. For example, the uninterruptible power system (UPS) is considered RPSE. Civil
Engineering support for RPSE should be provided according to a memorandum of understanding
with the owning organization, reimbursable expense, and subject to man-hour availability.
Equipment is also accounted for under the Equipment Authorization Inventory Data (EAID).
EAID items are non-replaceable equipment that the Air Force authorizes and is accounted for by
base supply
4.6. Work Status: Maintaining status of work requests submitted for other than minor
maintenance and repair is an important function performed by the OIC. Keeping your
commander and other key personnel in your organization informed on facilities issues is
normally a top priority. We recommend you utilize a locally devised control log to track work
requests. A using organization listing of work orders is available from the BCE/DPW CSU, and
project status can be obtained from the BCE/DPW Engineering section. A visit to job sites and
contacts with facility managers and civil engineer personnel are the best ways to obtain status of
ongoing work.
4.7. Other Methods to Accomplish Work: Although the host BCE/DPW is responsible for
maintenance and repair of base facilities occupied by 70 ISRW personnel, the 690 ALIS/MEAR
teams are other avenues to satisfy your facility construction and renovation requirements. The
scope of work and sensitivity of the area drive the need for MEAR team support. They can
perform maintenance, repair, and minor construction for you. They can also perform preventive
maintenance and repair of utility systems to improve reliability and emergency restoration of
critical utility systems. Remember that the primary responsibility for facilities work belongs
with the host BCE/DPW, and MEAR Team work must be approved by the host BCE/DPW just
as any other work. Contact the 717 CS/CE for procedures on requesting 690 ALIS/MEAR team
support. Do not overlook other resources like the Air Force Civil Engineering Support Agency,
Corps of Engineers, Naval Facilities Command (NAVFAC), guard and reserve units, Red Horse,
and SeaBee units.

                       PROJECT DEVELOPMENT AND EXECUTION

5.1. Project development and execution is one of the primary areas of responsibility for the
OIC. It is important that you understand not only the AF ISR project development, funding, and
execution system but also that of the host BCE/DPW. This will allow you to create and execute
a successful facility project program.
        5.1.1. Identification and Development of Requirements. This first step begins with the
        facility users, the facility manager and Civil Engineer Operations Manager (OM). It is
        important that the OM discuss the requirements in detail with the requestor. From this
        discussion, develop a semi-detailed statement of work (SOW) and an initial cost estimate.
        Do your research and give the project some serious thought. There is nothing worse than
        completing a project and finding out that the root of the problem was not corrected.
        Consider long-range implications of the project and how it ties into known or expected
        future mission changes. Make sure the host BCE/DPW is aware of the requirement once
        you have the SOW completed and that all their required paperwork is completed.
5.2. Prioritizing of Requirements. At some point, the OIC should have a discussion with the
group commander or deputy regarding project priorities. All project lists sent to 717 CS/CE
must be prioritized at the group level. There are several things to consider when assigning
priorities to facility projects.
     5.2.1. Facility Investment Metric (FIM) Program . ISR/A7C uses a modified FIM rating
     system for prioritizing projects. Since ISR units do not own any real property, the Mission
     Area aspect of the FIM is not used. However, the impact ratings are and should be assigned
     to each project per AFI 32-1032, Planning and Programming Appropriated Funded
     Maintenance, Repair, and Construction Projects. These impact ratings consider mission
     impact and workarounds, fire safety deficiency codes (FSDCs) and risk assessment codes
     (RACs).
     5.2.2. Local Long-Range Plans . Ideally, most facility projects will be part of a larger plan
     for each site. Priorities should be assigned to projects based on when the plan dictates that
     they be done. In some cases, the host installation may have their own long-range plans that
     involve your facilities. Make sure you are involved in any planning activities that may affect
     your site.
     5.2.3. Project Justification . Always consider the FIM definitions when completing
     project justification. Also include references to locally developed initiatives, quality of life,
     special command requests, etc. Keep justifications as short and to the point as possible.
     Example: ―Critical mission environmental control systems have failed; constant overheating
     creates frequent mission interruptions. Workarounds enabling operations entail potential
     security violations/safety hazards.
5.3. Planning and Programming Requirements. In this process the total scope and detailed
planning of the project is further developed. At this time, the program year for design and
project accomplishment as well as the method of execution is established. During this process
the funding source for project execution is determined. Host-funded projects are accomplished
through the OIC and host BCE/DPW, whereas, unit-funded projects are accomplished through
70ISRWH32-1002 6 OCTOBER 2009                                                                     11


the OIC and 717 CS/CE, and AF ISR-funded projects are accomplished by the Engineering
Manager, Group designated Engineering Manager (EM), 717 CS/CE, and AF ISR/A7C.
5.4. Advocating For Resources. Each site will have different procedures for advocating for
host funding. Make sure you are familiar with this process and encourage your leadership to
take an active role. To request funds from AF ISR, your prioritized projects must first be
submitted to 717 CS/CE for prioritization at the wing level. Calls for project submissions will be
initiated twice a year in preparation for the semi-annual AF ISR Civil Engineering Workshop.
These calls will come in the October-November and the March-April timeframes. In order to
accurately prioritize these projects, you will need to provide the following documents with your
submission.
   5.4.1. Project Data Sheet (PDS) . 717 CS/CE requires submittal of a PDS for all projects
   considered for ISR funding. A sample PDS is included at Attachment 5. PDSs must provide
   a clear description of the work, a solid justification, and defensible mission impact. The PDS
   will constitute your voice at wing-level prioritization meetings, so include sufficient detail to
   address any questions that you think may arise. Address host base involvement and why the
   project should be AF ISR’s bill to pay. Address alternatives that you’ve considered (if any)
   and why this alternative was chosen.
   5.4.2. Presentation Slide . To aid in presenting project information to the Wing
   Commander and AF ISR, prepare a presentation slide for each project. These slides will
   include the estimated project cost, a short description of the project, project status and a brief
   justification. Photographs of the project site or visual justification for the project are highly
   encouraged.
   5.4.3. Prioritization Letter . A memorandum listing your projects in priority order and
   signed by your Group or Site Commander must accompany each submission. This will allow
   717 CS/CE to accurately communicate each Group’s priorities to the Wing Commander for
   consideration during wing prioritization.
   5.4.4. Semi-annual AF ISR Civil Engineering Workshop . Twice a year, once in January
   and again in June, HQ ISR calls all Civil Engineering representatives from its subordinate
   units together to rack-and-stack projects for ISR funding. During the January workshop, each
   organization presents their facility program for the next two fiscal years. For example, in
   January 2009, workshop attendees will be discussing projects for FY10 and FY11. In June,
   the project list developed in January will be finalized. AF ISR/A7C will also request a status
   update of the current fiscal year projects and will identify projects that are candidates for end
   of year fallout execution. In general, there are two sources of funding available for AF ISR
   projects.
       5.4.4.1. Budget Activity Code (BAC) 1 . These funds are provided by the Air Force
       and are used to fund projects supporting the Air Force mission.
       5.4.4.2. Budget Activity Code (BAC) 4 . Also known as the Consolidated Cryptologic
       Program (CCP), these funds are provided by the NSA and are used for projects that
       directly support the mission of the NSA.
   5.4.5. Funding requests . When a project is ready for funding, send a project funding
   request to 717 CS/CE via email. The format for these requests is included at Attachment 6.
   717 CS/CE will verify that the project is on the approved project list and will forward the
12                                                        70ISRWH32-1002 6 OCTOBER 2009


     request to AF ISR/A7C. When AF ISR/A7C receives the request, they will verify that the
     project is on the approved project list and will coordinate with AF ISR to release the funds to
     70 ISRW/FM. This process is the same for both initial funding requests and request for
     additional money in the same fiscal year. If you need prior year money for a project, you
     will need to work with your FM folks to submit an upward obligation request.
     5.4.6. Project Execution . Upon receipt of funds, you will need to act quickly to execute
     the project. AF ISR/A7C’s goal for 100% program execution is 20 Jun of each year, giving
     the units approximately 3-4 months to fully execute their programs. Any project not
     executed by 20 Jun could have funding pulled.
     5.4.7. Tracking Execution . Once the project has been awarded, actively track its
     execution. Work closely with your executing authority and inspectors to make sure the
     project meets your needs and intent. Provide regular updates to 717 CS/CE on project status
     and notify them immediately of any problems that may delay project completion or result in
     requests for additional funds.

                                            Chapter 6

                           CRITICAL/SPECIALIZED SYSTEMS

6.1. The 70 ISRW mission requires the command to operate certain specialized equipment
items. In this chapter, we will discuss these requirements.
       6.1.1. Because 70 ISRW generates a large amount of classified paper documents, we
       must have an approved way to dispose of this classified material. 70 ISRW units operate
       many different types of classified destruction equipment (CDE). These include the DDS-
       18, incinerators, Security Engineered Machinery (SEM), and shredders. Some CDEs, are
       real property installed equipment (RPIE) and some are equipment authorization inventory
       data (EAID) equipment. HQ AF ISR/A7CC is the point of contact for operation of all
       CDEs. The EM is responsible for the operation, maintenance, and operator training of
       CDEs assigned to the unit. The host BCE/DPW is responsible for performing
       maintenance on RPIE units and maintains bench stock and special level spare parts.
       Maintenance on EAID CDE is performed by service contract. The support agreement
       should address host responsibilities for installed equipment.
6.2. Although electrical and air conditioning systems are not normally thought of as specialized
equipment, they are critical to the operation of 70 ISRW’s sensitive mission equipment. Almost
all utilities systems, which support 70 ISRW mission facilities, are RPIE and the responsibility
for maintenance and repair belongs to the BCE/DPW. The applicable AFIs provide more
detailed guidance in maintaining utility systems and outage reporting.
6.3. Because of the nature of the 70 ISRW mission, security alarm systems are essential. Two
different security alarm systems currently exist within 70 ISRW: interior and exterior systems.
Alarm systems are RPIE and maintenance/repair responsibilities belong to the BCE/DPW. Their
respective responsibilities should be included in the local SA. EM involvement in repair actions
and outage reporting on these systems is essential.
6.4. Uninterruptible Power System (UPS): UPS is a power conditioning or power-enhancing
device. It is a system designed to automatically provide power, without delay, during any period
when the normal power supply is incapable of performing acceptably. It provides quality and
continuity of an AC power source. UPS is considered RPSE or EAID. Civil engineering support
for RPSE or EAID is provided according to a memorandum of understanding with the using
organization. Your local Logistics Flight supply office will be able to assist with the acquisition
and maintenance (by contract) of the UPS. Additional guidance on acquisition and maintenance
can be obtained on UPS, generators, and other power conditioning and continuation interfacing
equipment (PCCIE) by contacting the PCCIE Program Manager at Ogden Air Logistics Center
(OO-ALC/LIPC), Hill AFB, UT.

                                           SUMMARY

7.1. It is impossible to cover all situations for all locations in this handbook. The OIC must
learn to operate effectively and efficiently within the local systems. Your ability to perform this
demanding job will have a direct bearing on the unit’s ability to perform its mission. The unit’s
mission equipment is only as reliable as the facilities that protect it and utilities that power and
environmentally control it. Likewise, people’s morale and ability to perform day-to-day duties
are also directly affected by facilities conditions. The information given in this handbook is
intended to help ensure that an effective and successful Engineering Management Program is in
place at our units worldwide. We wish you the best of luck and a successful tour with the 70 th
Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Wing!

Comprehensive 5-Year Planning. Planning is the act of identification of facility work to satisfy
current and future missions’ requirements. Comprehensive planning gives decision-makers vital
development information. It must utilize a systematic approach in which unit personnel, the civil
engineer community, and others identify where the unit needs to be in the future, evaluate
various ways of getting there, and implement the plans to make it happen. Programming, the
process of acquiring both the authority and resources necessary to accomplish the planned work,
links the Unit Facility Management 5-Year Plan to reality. Only through effective programming
do we see the ideas represented in the plan turned into actual completed projects. After facility
requirements are identified, they will be validated, prioritized and approved by the proper
authority prior to funding.

2.2. General Facility Description. Constructed in 1997 and 1998, the buildings 9805 and 9801
infrastructure is essentially new and in good working order. The 1st IS facilities consist of two
structures along with an open courtyard between. Building 9805 houses the command section
and resource staffs while building 9801 houses primarily support functions.
   Building 9805 is a two-story 22,000 square foot SCI facility. A typical 4,160-120/208V
   100KVA-service transformer, underground secondary service conductors provides electrical
   service, and switchgear located in mechanical room. The HVAC system consists of one (1)
   air-cooled condenser chiller or "package" unit and two (2) central air handling units (one on
   each floor). The roof is the original low slope polyurethane membrane system.
   Building 9801 is a two-story 22,000 square foot facility; 11,000 square foot is SCIF.
   Electrical service is provided by a typical 4,160-120/208V 100KVA service transformer,
   underground secondary service conductors, and switchgear located in mechanical room. The
   HVAC system consists of one (1) air-cooled condenser chiller or "package" unit and two (2)
   central air handling units (one on each floor). The roof is the original low slope polyurethane
   membrane system.


2.3. Facility Floor Plans.
Facility floor plans are located in the unit files.
[The general descriptions should provide minimum detail for decision-makers and implementers
to understand where the facilities are and where they need to be.]
3. FACILITY MANAGEMENT GOALS AND OBJECTIVES:
3.1. Overall Assessment.
Overall, the 1st Intelligence Squadron (ISR) has considerable mission equipment and systems on
the operational floor resulting in compressed space use and high noise levels due to equipment
and number of personnel. Additionally, approximately 30 authorized billets have been added to
the unit UMD and over 40 operational equipment systems are due in requiring space for
personnel, equipment, and storage. The major problem is available space with all ISR operations
currently located in two buildings.
3.2. Facility Management Goals.
(1) Noise Management. Obtain the necessary expertise and resources to determine the most
effective management of noise, identify noise deficiencies, and execute solutions to resolve noise
problems.
(2) Space Management. Obtain the necessary expertise and resources to determine the most
efficient use of available space, identify space deficiencies, and execute solutions to resolve
space problems.

3.3. Facility Management Initiatives.
(1-A) Noise Reduction. Employing the host safety office to conduct noise levels survey and
develop a comprehensive noise reduction plan.
(2-A) Space Use Study. Employing the Air Force Design Assistance Program conducted by the
Air Force Center of Environmental Excellence (AFCEE) to develop a comprehensive space
utilization study, detailed area relocation recommendations, and conceptual renovation designs to
consolidate functions, redistribute space, and improve quality of life. Efficient space use and
professional setting directly impacts both quality of life and mission accomplishment.
(2-B) Basement Development. There is additional space in the basement, but due to a problem
with water infiltration during rain, developed use of this area is limited. Upgrades to the
basement would help with the squadron’s storage problem.
(2-C) MILCON. The portion of the space requirements that can not be met with available space
is to be submitted for consideration as a project to be funded by the Military Construction
(MILCON) program.
4. FACILITY CONDITION ASSESSMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
(1) SUBJ: FY 00 Infrastructures and Facility Assessment Team (IFAT) Report, 1st IS, FT
    MEADE AFB, MD, 28 Feb –1 Apr 00.
     Summary: Roof damaged by recent storm and needs significant repairs/replacement. Entry
     doorframes misalign due to excessive weight of SCI door. The exterior of the facility
     requires protective coating to ensure structural integrity. Electrical systems are generally in
     good condition, but mission operations area lacks back-up electrical power support.
     Maintenance area requires additional electrical outlets to safely replace existing extension
     cords. Organization requires additional space to met AF standards and future space
     requirement may require a unit new facility. Due to close quarters between personnel and
     equipment, ambient noise levels are a concern. Environmental control systems are adequate,
     however building 9805 is hampered by an inadequate control system. Restrooms
     throughout the facilities are in sub standard condition. Overall, the real property systems
     support the mission of the 1st IS satisfactorily.

(2) SUBJ: FY 01 Redundant Power Development Staff Assistance Visit Report, 1st IS, FT
    MEADE AFB, MD, 1 - 10 Jun 00.
     Summary: To support the mission operations area with required back-up electrical power,
     it was determined to be most cost effective to supply the facility with generator power.
     Project documentation was developed and initiated with the host BCE/DPW staff.
     For further information reference the complete report located in the unit files.
[Facility condition and recommendation sources, to include recent ISR Infrastructure and
Facility Assessment Team (IFAT) reports, are to be included or cross-referenced.]
