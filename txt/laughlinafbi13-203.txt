   run-up area used for Runway 31 operations, just prior to Taxiway Delta, is closed to aircraft
   operations. There are two sunshade units (located on U and DD parking rows) that violate the
   primary lateral clearance for Runway 13R/31L and they do not have sufficient vertical tail
   clearance for T-1 aircraft.
1.2. General Procedures
   1.2.1. Runway Selection Procedures
      1.2.1.1. Runways 13 L/C/R are designated as the calm-wind runways.
      1.2.1.2. At the beginning of the flying day and after receiving the weather briefing, the
      SOF (when on duty) will determine the active runway and inform AMOPS. When a
      runway change is required, the SOF will make the decision in coordination with the
      Tower Watch Supervisor. The exact timing of the change will be coordinated based on
      current traffic conditions. The RAPCON will determine the last aircraft for the current
      runway after coordination with the Tower Watch Supervisor and SOF. If a SOF is not on
      duty, the Tower Watch supervisor will determine the need and timing of runway changes.
      Tower notifies RAPCON and AMOPS of runway in use. AMOPS notifies 47 OSS/OSW
      and updates the Airfield Status page.
   1.2.2. Supervisor of Flying (SOF) Operating from the Tower
      1.2.2.1. The SOF is responsible to the OG/CC for the safe conduct of flying operations at
      Laughlin. When required, the SOF will seek guidance from the OG/CC, OG/CD, or
      acting OG/CC. In time critical instances when such consultation is not feasible, the SOF
      will make required decisions with the authority of the OG/CC.
      1.2.2.2. SOFs and watch supervisors will maintain a close working relationship based on
      mutual trust and respect.
      1.2.2.3. To promote effective and efficient flight operations the SOF may suggest, based
      on knowledge of the flying schedule and unique circumstances of individual missions,
      actions that affect ATC operations.
      1.2.2.4. The separation and sequencing of traffic are the responsibilities of the watch
      supervisors and controllers. Except in an emergency, the SOF will not transmit over
      ATC frequencies without prior coordination with ATC (this does not apply to dedicated
      SOF frequencies). All radio transmissions to a distressed aircrew, from other than the
      SOF or ATC, will be coordinated through the SOF. The SOF may transmit ―Foreman’s
      Up‖ without coordinating with the Watch Supervisor to let the aircraft know the SOF
      copies all of the transmissions.
8                                                LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


       1.2.2.5. During an emergency, the SOF is expected to provide assistance to distressed
       aircrew recovering on the single frequency approach. The SOF will coordinate with the
       facility watch supervisor prior to transmitting on an ATC frequency. In no case will the
       SOF delay a time critical transmission to an emergency aircraft due to artificial concerns
       about frequency ownership. If the SOF utilizes an ATC frequency without explicit ATC
       approval, the SOF assumes responsibility for separation of all aircraft controlled on that
       frequency. The SOF will not perform ATC functions or transmit ATC instructions or
       clearances to aircraft.
       1.2.2.6. ATC services shall be in accordance with FAAO 7110.65 and AFI 13-204 V3.
       1.2.2.7. At no time shall the SOF perform ATC functions or transmit ATC instructions
       or clearances to any aircraft or direct the actions of any air traffic controller.
    1.2.3. Local Operating Area. The local operating area is defined as all airspace within the
    delegated basic approach airspace (Clockwise from the Rio Grande River to the DLF 077R,
    0-59NM, surface to FL230. Clockwise from the DLF 077R to the DLF 088R, 49-59NM,
    6000 to FL230. Clockwise from the DLF 078R to the 110R, 0-49NM, surface to FL230,
    clockwise from the DLF 110R to the Rio Grande River, 0-60NM, surface to FL230),
    Laughlin MOAs, Alert Areas, Laughlinassigned MTRs, SRs, and the Laughlin AFB civilian
    corridor.
    1.2.4. DELETED
    1.2.5. Airfield Management (AM)
       1.2.5.1. AM will perform a daily comprehensive airfield check IAW AFI 13-204 V3,
       before the start of wing flying activities. This check must include but is not limited to,
       the primary takeoff and taxi surfaces, runway surface condition (RSC) determination,
       FOD/BASH/habitat control, ponding, etc. An airfield inspection will be performed after
       the initial airfield check.
           1.2.5.1.1. AM will not issue a Runway Condition Reading Value due to the
           equipment requirement exemption located in AFI 13-213 AETC Supplement 1.
           1.2.5.1.2. AM will examine the movement and non-movement areas to determine if
           the areas require a FOD sweep. AM will meet with the sweeper each morning to
           relay what, if any, areas require a sweep outside the routine sweeping areas.
           1.2.5.1.3. If the AM determines the airfield requires mowing, he/she will contact the
           Grounds/Maintenance Site Manager. AM will provide the area/areas that are required
           to be mowed. If AM is unable to get in contact with the Grounds/Maintenance Site
           Manager, a job will be opened through 47 CES.
       1.2.5.2. Airfield lighting serviceability and retro-reflectivity check: AM will perform a
       check of the on field lighting systems and retro-reflectivity of markings daily before
       sunrise or after sunset depending on airfield hours except as noted in para 1.2.5.2.3.
       below.
           1.2.5.2.1. Airfield lighting check will include checking the lighting at different
           intensity levels. (steps 1-5 for Runway 13C/31C and 13L/31R or steps 1-3 for
           Runway 13R/31L).
LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010                                                              9


         1.2.5.2.2. CE airfield lighting will perform a weekly check of lighting systems
         located off base owned and/or operated by Laughlin.
         1.2.5.2.3. An airfield lighting and retro-reflectivity check will not be performed on
         days when the airfield is open for limited hours (during daylight hours only) unless
         the field is forecasted for IMC conditions. If so, the check will be done approximately
         30 minutes prior to airfield opening.
         1.2.5.2.4. AM will check the retro-reflective characteristics (reflect light back to the
         source) of runway and taxiway markings.
     1.2.5.3. Additional Airfield Checks. AM will perform additional airfield checks as
     required in support of IFEs/GEs, RSC determination, FOD/BASH/Habitat control, wide
     body aircraft (e.g. KC10, B747, C17) movements, natural disasters, unauthorized aircraft
     landings, severe weather, construction area checks, airfield driving violations, CMA
     violations and maintenance reports. The SOF will notify AM of additional Airfield
     Checks that are required in support of IFEs/GEs. The SOF will be notified by AM of any
     conditions presenting a hazard to operations.
     1.2.5.4. RSC Determination: AM will determine the RSC IAW AFI 13-213 before the
     start of flying each day. AM will report RSC IAW AFI 13-213 para 5.3. and update the
     Airfield Status Page. As the day progresses, the SOF may use inputs from pilots and the
     RSUs to determine if further RSC checks are required. If required the SOF will notify
     AM to respond. The RSC will be reported as either ―dry‖, ―wet‖, or ―wet with standing
     water.‖ AM will issue the appropriate NOTAM for a ―wet‖ runway.
     1.2.5.5. Spofford Aux Field: The Fire Emergency Services Flight will conduct a daily
     check of Spofford Aux field prior to flying operations there and report any discrepancies
     immediately to Laughlin Airfield Management. AM will conduct a monthly inspection
     of Spofford Aux field.
  1.2.6. ATIS Information
     1.2.6.1. The ATIS message will contain the following additional information:
     1.2.6.2. Flying status and alternates. T-1 status will only be included when other than
     ―unrestricted.‖
     1.2.6.3. Any information pertinent to local flying operations, to include who controls the
     runways if other than normal. Normal operations are defined as Honcho control of the
     inside, Tower control of the center, and Lariat control of the outside runway.
     1.2.6.4. Tower watch supervisor will approve any additional ATIS content based on
     whether it is pertinent to local flying operations.
  1.2.7. Airfield Hours of Operation: For air traffic control purposes, ―wing flying hours‖ are
  determined by the 47 OG/CC and normally consist of scheduled local flying activity, except
  cross country launches and returns.
     1.2.7.1. Opening. For normal wing flying hours, as defined above, the airfield will open
     no later than 15 minutes prior to the first scheduled takeoff time or at the published
     opening time (per NOTAMs), as appropriate. Tower, RAPCON, and AMOPS must be in
     place before the airfield can open. Tower will notify AMOPS when the airfield is open.
 10                                              LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


      The SOF will announce the airfield open on the Command Net. If the opening time
      differs from the published time, AMOPS will issue a NOTAM. During normal wing
      flying, 47 FTW aircraft shall not be allowed to taxi for takeoff when there is no SOF
      present for duty unless directly approved by the 47 OG/CC.
      1.2.7.2. Tower will determine which vehicles are in the CMA 15 minutes prior to the
      airfield opening by announcing ―TOWER IS ON THE NET‖. During this time vehicles
      operators are ―uncontrolled‖ on the airfield. Vehicle operators must establish two-way
      radio communication with the control tower and relay their position. At airfield opening
      the tower will announce ―TOWER CONTROLS THE CMA‖. At this time all vehicle
      operations become ―controlled‖. Vehicle operators must then request access, and be
      granted tower permission in order to operate within the CMA.
      1.2.7.3. Closing. AMOPS closes the airfield based on the completion of local
      flying/transient aircraft/outbound aircraft sorties, as appropriate. The SOF notifies Tower
      when flying is completed (Tower notifies AMOPS). If the airfield will close immediately
      after the termination of wing flying, the SOF will announce that the airfield is closed on
      the Command Net. If the airfield is to remain open, the SOF will announce the
      termination of wing flying on the Command Net. AMOPS will notify Command Post
      when the airfield is closed and Command Post will make an announcement on the
      Command Net. AMOPS issues a NOTAM if required.
      1.2.7.4. The SOF obtains authority to extend airfield operating hours from the 47
      OSS/CC or
47 OSS/DO. Coordination between all supporting agencies must be accomplished to ensure
complying with duty limitations.
      1.2.7.5. Extending Flying Window. Squadron Sup and wing programming will initiate
      the Schedule Change Checklist. The 47 OSS is the OPR for this checklist and will
      contact 47 OG/CC for approval. The 47 OSS will notify the SOF and squadrons of
      approval/disapproval. Air Traffic Control facility chief controllers will ensure proper
      manning support and adherence to controller crew rest requirements. If the actual airfield
      opening/closing time differs from the published time, AMOPS will issue a NOTAM.
      AMOPS must be notified of a change to airfield operating hours NLT two hours prior to
      closure. 47 OSS Airspace Office will coordinate MOA extension.
      1.2.7.6. Temporary Facility Closures. 47 OG/CC is the approval authority for temporary
      closures (less than 72 hours) of ATC facilities. The decision to approve should consider
      prior coordination with all system users and responsibility to the National Airspace
      System.
1.3. Flight Plan Procedures
   1.3.1. All aircrews will notify their respective duty desk of any tail number changes prior to
   takeoff. If no duty desk is active, aircrews will call AMOPS on UHF 372.2 or at DSN 732-
   5308.
   1.3.2. Aircrews and/or the duty desk will notify AMOPS or the respective duty desk of any
   Callsign changes before takeoff or during an out and back.
LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010                                                               11


  1.3.3. T-6 Single-Ship Local Operations. Coordination with AMOPS is not required for
  local operations on the default flight plan. All aircraft on the default flight plan will fly the
  route depicted in the T-6 IFG; the only exception being ―spin‖ downs for practice approaches
  at NTAs underlying Laughlin’s airspace. Aircraft who divert because of weather or
  emergency must notify AMOPS. Callsigns and beacon code information will be maintained
  by OSS/OSAX. T-6 aircraft will only use callsigns and beacon codes depicted in the T-6
  IFG.
  1.3.4. Cross Country Flights. Cross country flights are flights that depart/land at locations
  other than Laughlin. Aircrews will file a DD Form 175 or DD Form 1801 with AMOPS.
  1.3.5. Formations and FCF Flights. Aircrews will coordinate with AMOPS for a pre-
  approved stereo flight plan or a DD Form 175. Use the duty desk hotline to file stereos.
  1.3.6. Flight Plan (FP) Coordination. AMOPS shall receive FPs, input them into the FAA
  system and notify ATC of all IFR and VFR FP (exclusive of local stereo FP).
     1.3.6.1. ATC notifies AMOPS of actual departure and arrival times. If any of these
     aircraft arrive or depart an RSU controlled runway, the RSU will relay to tower the
     arrival/departure time. NOTE: Times should normally be reported within 10 minutes.
     1.3.6.2. FPs that are activated and subsequently cancelled due to an air abort may be re-
     filed by AMOPS if the callsign, and crew are unchanged and the crew notifies AMOPS
     of new times and/or route via PTD or through the squadron duty desk.
     1.3.6.3. A FP filed for multiple aircraft in-formation may be re-filed for individual
     aircraft or elements of the formation either if the formation breaks-up prior to departure
     or is an individual air abort. Procedures above apply to individual aircraft, but the Pilot
     in Command (PIC) must ensure AMOPS is aware of the returning aircraft’s tail number
     and pilot’s name.
  1.3.7. Flight Plan Filing Procedures. All aircraft departing Laughlin AFB must have an
  original, signed FP on file. Exception: Civil aircraft (e.g. Scheduled Air Carrier, Charters,
  General Aviation, Border Patrol, Homeland Security, etc.) are exempt from this requirement,
  but must have a flight plan on file elsewhere. Otherwise, a DD Form 175 must be filed. 47
  FTW aircraft may file a pre-approved stereo FP instead of using DD Form 175, when
  departing and landing at Laughlin AFB only. Aircraft who divert because of weather or an
  emergency must notify AMOPS or FSS. A list of pre-approved stereo FPs can be found in
  the IFG or appropriate Annex of the Houston ARTCC and Laughlin AFB LOA. All aircraft
  not using a pre-approved stereo FP (including transients) originating from Laughlin AFB
  must file a DD Form 175 Military Flight Plan or DD Form 1801; flight plans must be filed
  with AMOPS at least 30 minutes prior to departure. The only other method of authorized
  departure from Laughlin AFB is on a stopover FP. If AMOPS has not received information
  on a stopover flight plan, AMOPS will contact the originating agency to confirm a flight plan
  is on file.
     1.3.7.1. AMOPS will accept and file FPs after reviewing for errors or omissions. If
     errors are found, the FP will be denied and short explanation of errors included.
     1.3.7.2. 47 FTW aircrews may file DD Form 175 or DD Form 1801 FPs electronically
     using LAN or FAX (x4035) provided their unit has developed procedures to maintain the
 12                                                LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


       signed, original form. In case of LAN/printer failure, AMOPS will notify the duty desks
       and FPs will be hand delivered to AMOPS.
          1.3.7.2.1. Electronic/faxed FPs will fulfill the same requirements as FPs with regard
          to flight clearances, flight following and anti-hijack procedures.
          1.3.7.2.2. An appropriate approval authority will sign the original FP and file it using
          procedures established by the unit.
          1.3.7.2.3. The PIC will verify with AMOPS that the FP has been received and is
          correct. They will also relay their tail number.
       1.3.7.3. Stereo flight plans will be coordinated over the duty desk hotline. Stereos may
       be filed via print out to the AMOPS printer. SARM will verify receipt of the stereo
       printout with AMOPS.
       1.3.7.4. If a crew or passenger manifest is not entered on/with the FP, the PIC shall
       indicate the location they are on file.
       1.3.7.5. FPs can be amended via PTD or phone as long as the original is on file. FPs on
       file at another location may be amended or re-filed via PTD or phone as long as AMOPS
       verifies the original is on file at the original departure location.
   1.3.8. Documentation. Units shall maintain original FP, crew list, passenger manifests and
   tail numbers in accordance with Air Force RDS, Table 13-07, Rule 3.00. In the event of an
   aircraft related mishap, the original FP, crew list and passenger manifests, as applicable, shall
   be handled according to LAFB Plan 91-1. Once a week the duty desks will forward the
   original flight plans to AMOPS for disposition.
       1.3.8.1. DELETED
   1.3.9. Flight Plan Monitoring. If ATC has not received notification from AMOPS of a FP
   (except stereos), AMOPS will be queried to validate authorization for aircraft movement.
   Movement will not be authorized until the status of the FP is determined.
   1.3.10. T-6 Non-Towered Airport (NTA) Sorties. Pilots will file a flight plan (using the
   appropriate off-station callsign) with AMOPS for all Mission Qualification Training (MQT)
   NTA sorties and sorties where instrument approaches will be flown (Exception: Edwards
   County, Maverick County and Del Rio International). Pilots must contact Clearance
   Delivery before departing on these sorties. Pilots who visit NTA fields on other sorties via
   drift-down or delay before proceeding to the MOA do not require a flight plan or off-station
   callsign.
1.4. Local Aircraft Priorities
   1.4.1. Emergency aircraft or aircraft in distress have right-of-way over all other aircraft.
   Distinguished Visitors will have priority over all routine operations.
   1.4.2. ATC Pattern Priorities. Note: during Alternating Instrument status, airframes are not
   afforded priority simply because it is "their window." ATC provides service based on the
   priorities of this paragraph.
       1.4.2.1. Emergency aircraft.
LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010                                                              13


      1.4.2.2. Other priorities listed in FAAO 7110.65: Civilian air ambulance flights, military
      air evacuation flights, flight check aircraft, etc.
      1.4.2.3. Distinguished visitors.
      1.4.2.4. Aircraft with CDTs
      1.4.2.5. RADAR arrivals making a full stop or option to Tower/Lariat/Honcho
      1.4.2.6. Instrument departures
      1.4.2.7. RADAR arrivals planning option to RADAR
      1.4.2.8. VFR entry. (Note: T-6 aircraft recovering from the east for VFR entry have
      priority over practice ELPs)
1.5. Aircraft Arresting Systems
   1.5.1. BAK-15 barriers are installed on runways 13L/31R and 13C/31C. The Tower is
   responsible for ensuring the barriers are operational and in proper configuration. ATC will
   issue appropriate advisories to all aircraft when the barrier is in or indicates a non-standard
   configuration. If an aircraft under RAPCON control requires the barrier in a specific
   position, RAPCON will notify Tower as soon as practical, but no later than the aircraft being
   established on final. Opposite direction runway requests will not have a BAK 15 in place for
   landing unless prior notification of at least 15 minutes is given to allow for the energy
   absorbers to be connected.
   1.5.2. Prior to the first Class A RSU tour, Lariat controllers will confirm with Tower the
   active runway and ensure operation of the BAK-15 for the active runway only, by raising and
   lowering the barrier. RSU crews must ensure they do not attempt to raise the non-active
   barrier due to the possibility of damaging the barrier. On Runway 13L/31R, all takeoffs will
   be discontinued and all airborne aircraft will be cleared ―RESTRICTED LOW APPROACH‖
   while testing the BAK-15 operation.
   1.5.3. Barrier Inspections
      1.5.3.1. Airfield Management will inspect aircraft arresting systems during airfield
      inspections or when requested for obvious conditions that could compromise the system’s
      operation. If an unsafe condition exists, AM will exit the runway and relay to tower the
      nature of the problem. AM will also notify CE through EMCS and request barrier
      maintenance inspect the barrier. If barrier maintenance determines that the barrier is
      unsafe, they will exit the runway and relay the barrier status to the tower and how long it
      will take to repair. The tower will coordinate with the SOF for repair time and whether
      or not operations will continue on the effected runway. AM will publish the appropriate
      NOTAMs (runway operations will be suspended while work is conducted on the barrier)
      and coordinate the outage with the appropriate agencies.
      1.5.3.2. 47 CES/CEO (Akima) will perform daily inspection checks and sign the record
      of inspection. The first inspection will be accomplished prior to airfield opening and will
      include raising and lowering of the BAK-15 by the tower remote control panel followed
      by a visual inspection. Fire Emergency Services Flight will perform barrier inspections
      and runway changes after duty hours and on Sunday.
      1.5.3.3. DELETED
 14                                               LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


   1.5.4. Barrier Configuration: Standard configuration is in the down position with the energy
   absorbers for the active runway connected and the inactive runway disconnected. Following
   the first barrier inspection of the day or after a runway change, Barrier Maintenance or the
   Fire Emergency Services Flight will confirm with Tower the active runway in use and
   disconnect and/or reconnect the energy absorbers on the BAK 15 barriers as follows:
      1.5.4.1. Runway 13 Active: Disconnect the energy absorbers on the Approach End
      (North End) of Runways 13C and 13L. Connect the energy absorbers on the Departure
      End (South End) of Runways 13C and 13 L.
      1.5.4.2. Runway 31 Active: Disconnect the energy absorbers on the Approach End
      (South End) of Runways 31C and 31R. Connect the energy absorbers on the Departure
      End (North End) of Runways 31C and 31R.
   1.5.5. Barrier Procedures for Emergency Runway Change: Tower will notify the AMOPS
   who will contact EMCS (Energy Management Control System). In the event that EMCS is
   unable to contact barrier maintenance for the runway change the Fire Emergency Services
   Flight will be contacted. The Fire Emergency Services Flight will respond immediately to
   reconfigure the barriers as directed by Tower.
      1.5.5.1. Approaches and/or landings are not permitted over a raised BAK-15 approach
      end barrier.
      1.5.5.2. DELETED
1.6. Controlled Movement Area (CMA)
   1.6.1. The CMA is defined as the runways, infield taxiways and other areas used for taxiing,
   takeoff and landing of aircraft, exclusive of loading ramps and parking areas. The CMA is
   bordered by an extended line 100 feet west and parallel to runway 13R/31L and 100 feet east
   and parallel to runway 13L/31R extending to inside edge of North and South perimeter roads.
   Attachment 5, Airfield Diagram, depicts the CMA.
   1.6.2. All vehicles will make radio contact with Tower and gain approval to enter the CMA.
   Transient Alert personnel conducting tow procedures will advise Tower of their location,
   destination and intentions. Only vehicles in direct support of mission essential activities are
   authorized to operate in the CMA. Vehicle operators will read back all instructions verbatim.
   Tower will request a read back if one is not received. If required, the Tower will coordinate
   with the affected RSU for vehicle access to their runway. AMOPS will monitor the RAMP
   net while the airfield is open.
   1.6.3. Prior to work being performed in the airport movement area, there will be strict
   coordination between AMOPS, the flying squadrons, and Tower to establish acceptable
   procedures/distances for safety of work personnel and equipment from the runway. Direct
   two-way radio communication will be maintained between the work area and Tower.
   Personnel and equipment will be no closer to the runways than 100 feet from the edge of the
   runway or the hold short line without authorization.
   1.6.4. When personnel and vehicles are recalled from the controlled movement area, they
   will withdraw to a safe distance from the runway (at least 100 feet from the runway edge).
   Tower will notify Airfield Management of personnel or vehicles with lost communications.
   Airfield management will intercept the personnel to alleviate the situation.

   1.6.5. Withdrawal of Personnel/Vehicles from Runways or Facilities. After receiving
   notification from Tower, personnel and equipment will move outside 100 feet. There are
   three methods which Tower will use to recall personnel and vehicles from the runways:
      1.6.5.1. Radio. In case of radio failure, personnel and vehicles will be moved at least
      100 feet away from the runway until a replacement radio is obtained.
      1.6.5.2. Flashing of Taxiway/Runway lights.
      1.6.5.3. Light Gun Signals. Work personnel should periodically monitor the Tower and
      RSUs for light gun signals.
   1.6.6. Airfield Smoking Policy. Smoking is not authorized east of First Street.
1.7. Laughlin Practice Area
   1.7.1. Laughlin AFB Practice Area RSU practice areas (Figure 1.1) have been established
   IAW AETCI 11-204, and HQ Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA) policy letter,
   Practice Area within Class C airspace, dated 9 Aug 99 (on file at 47 OSS/OSA). Practice
   areas are exempt from Class C requirements IAW FAA Order 7210.3, Facility Operations
   and Administration, paragraph 11-1-4g. AETCI 11-204, Runway Supervisory Units, governs
   practice area operations while that airspace is delegated to an RSU.

   1.7.2. Description. The practice area includes all airspace from the surface up to and
   including 3100' MSL (expands to include ELP airspace, defined below when released by
   RAPCON) within 9 DME of DLF VORTAC from the DLF 300 radial clockwise to the DLF
   136 radial, direct to the DLF 135 radial at 5 DME, within 5 DME of DLF VORTAC from the
   135 radial clockwise to the 267 radial, within the boundary from DLF 267/005 to DLF
   288/007, within 7 DME of DLF from the DLF 288 radial to the DLF 300 radial, then along
   the 300 radial to 9 DME. This practice area is further divided into the following five sectors:
       1.7.2.1. Honcho Sector. From the DLF 285 radial at .9 DME outbound to the DLF 300
       radial at 7 DME, then counterclockwise to the DLF 288 radial at 7 DME, then direct to
       the DLF 267 radial at 5 DME, then counterclockwise to the DLF 135 radial at 5 DME,
       then direct to the DLF 161 radial at .6 DME, then direct to the DLF 285 radial at .9 DME.
       1.7.2.2. Tower Sector. From the DLF 285 radial at .9 DME outbound to the DLF 300
       radial at 9 DME, then clockwise to the DLF 310 radial at 9 DME, then direct to the DLF
       306 radial at
5 DME, then direct to the DLF 293 radial at .9 DME, then direct DLF 150 radial at .6 DME
direct to the DLF 131 radial at 5 DME, direct to the DLF 126 radial at 9 DME, then clockwise to
LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010                                                               17


the DLF 136 radial at 9 DME, then direct to the DLF 135 radial at 5 DME, then direct to the
DLF 161 radial at .6 DME, then direct to the DLF 285 radial at .9 DME.
       1.7.2.3. Lariat Sector. From the DLF 150 radial at .6 DME direct to the DLF 131 radial
       at
5 DME, direct to the DLF 126 radial at 9 DME, then counterclockwise to the DLF 079 radial at
9 DME then direct the DLF 004 radial at 9 DME then counterclockwise to the DLF 310 radial at
9 DME, then direct to the DLF 306 radial at 5 DME, then direct to the DLF 293 radial at
.9 DME, then direct DLF 150 radial at .6 DME.
       1.7.2.4. Transition Sector. From the DLF 004 radial at 9 DME direct to the DLF 079
       radial at 9 DME and within 9DME of the DLF VORTAC.
       1.7.2.5. ELP Sector. Within 3 NM radius, above Lariat/Honcho Sector to 4100’ MSL,
       not including Tower Sector, from the DLF 140 radial clockwise to the DLF 300 radial,
       from the DLF 310 radial clockwise to the DLF 130 radial.
   1.7.3. Control of practice area. RAPCON is the default controlling agency of the Laughlin
   AFB practice area airspace. When RAPCON is in control of that airspace, Class ―C‖ service
   will be provided. If the ceiling is less than 1000’AGL and/or visibility is less than 3 SM,
   RAPCON will maintain control of the practice area. If the ceiling is greater than 1000’ AGL
   and the visibility is greater than 3 SM, RAPCON will release the entire practice area
   airspace, with the exception of the Transition and ELP Sector, to the Control Tower.
       1.7.3.1. When the practice area is active, RAPCON will protect the airspace unless
       otherwise coordinated with the controlling agency.
       1.7.3.2. Each RSU will call Tower to begin and terminate RSU operations using the
       following procedures:
           1.7.3.2.1. The requesting agency will coordinate with the releasing agency for radio
           checks and aircraft arresting system checks, when warranted.
           1.7.3.2.2. The releasing agency will issue appropriate conditions (altimeter setting,
           bird condition, flying statuses, etc.) affecting the runway and airspace use. Callsigns
           and positions of all aircraft in the airspace, including any pending arrivals, will also
           be passed to the requesting agency.
           1.7.3.2.3. The releasing agency will state ―YOU HAVE CONTROL OF RUNWAY
           (designator) AND YOU HAVE CONTROL OF THE BAK-15 (if applicable).‖ The
           requesting agency will reply ―HONCHO/LARIAT/TOWER CONTROLS RUNWAY
           (designator) AND CONTROLS THE BAK-15 (if applicable) AT (time).‖ Unless
           otherwise coordinated, the releasing agency will only release the one appropriate
           practice       area        sector       to     the       requesting       agency.
           1.7.3.2.4. While primary control of the barrier is transferred to Lariat, Tower
           maintains secondary control. Both Lariat and Tower are able to raise the barrier if
           required.
              1.7.3.2.4.1. The first RSU controller/monitor of the day will ensure that Tower
              has enabled the barrier control switch and the amber control light on the switch
              panel is illuminated. Tower will retain override authority over the system, but the
              RSU monitor will now be able to raise the barrier even when Tower controls the
 18                                               LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


               pattern. If both Tower and RSU switches are actuated simultaneously, the barrier
               will still raise.
               1.7.3.2.4.2. When the RSU is being closed for the remainder of the day, the
               outgoing controller/monitor will relinquish barrier control to Tower and ensure
               the amber control light extinguishes.
       1.7.3.3. Tower will notify RAPCON when control of a runway changes to another
       facility.
       1.7.3.4. If provided, the Center Runway Monitor shall monitor Tower frequency at all
       times.
   1.7.4. Services Provided. With the exception of IFR arrivals and departures under RAPCON
   and/or Tower control, 47 FTW-assigned aircraft operating in the practice area will not
   receive Class C services. Aircraft operating outside the practice area will receive Class C
   services. All 47 FTW aircraft, except those established in the RSU practice areas, will
   participate in the Laughlin Class C service. Aircraft will also comply with any control
   instructions if VFR beyond 20 NM, but planning to enter the Class C airspace. See Figure
   4.1
       1.7.4.1. The RSU will not be used for ATC service except for preventive control
       purposes to SUPT aircraft IAW FAA Order 7210.3, para 4-4-3, or in an emergency
       situation.
1.8. Prior Permission Required (PPR). Laughlin AFB requires transient aircraft to contact
AMOPS (DSN 732-5308, COM 830-298-5308) to receive a PPR number before they can land at
Laughlin. AMOPS will obtain required information from transient aircraft and coordinate with
affected base agencies (i.e. Transient Alert, Security Forces, Fuels) before issuing a PPR number.
1.9. Transient Alert Service/Support. All transient aircraft shall relay transient services
required during application of PPR with AMOPS.

                                  GROUND OPERATIONS

3.1. Taxiing
   3.1.1. Clearance. Aircrews request taxi clearance by stating, ―GROUND, CS, TAXI,
   number of aircraft, WITH (ATIS).‖ Aircrew will respond to taxi instructions with ―CS,
   TAXI TO 13/31 R/L/C /HOLD SHORT‖ (if applicable).
      3.1.1.1. During ―Instrument status/GPS Bravo status,‖ single-ship T-6 aircraft shall
      depart on the following IFR clearance: Aircrews are automatically cleared to the
      DLF133/013 fix via the QWAIL ROUTE. Climb and maintain 13,000’ MSL. Expect
      further clearance at 13 DME.
   3.1.2. Taxi on the yellow line in the parking area. Wing walkers are not required if vehicles
   and/or equipment are parked behind the WHITE lines immediately in front of parked aircraft.
   3.1.3. Taxiing Across Runways. If crossing an RSU controlled runway, remain on the RSU
   frequency until crossing the opposite side ―hold‖ line.
   3.1.4. T-6/T38s may stagger taxi outside the parking area with the following exceptions:
      3.1.4.1. Do not stagger taxi in parking, or on taxiways B, C, D or G1.
      3.1.4.2. Do not stagger taxi between sunset and sunrise.
   3.1.5. All taxiing aircraft will stop and give way to responding emergency vehicles. Ground
   Control will broadcast to all taxiing aircraft that emergency vehicles are responding.
   3.1.6. Aircraft will not taxi over the BAK-15 Aircraft Arresting System.
   3.1.7. Exiting the runways.
      3.1.7.1. Contact Ground Control to cross Tower controlled runways. If Tower does not
      control the inside runway (13R/31L), monitor Honcho’s frequency for clearance to cross.
          3.1.7.1.1. Inform Ground Control of which runway aircraft is holding short of, and at
          which intersection.       Example: ―CS, holding short of 13C/31C at
          Delta/Foxtrot/Alpha.‖
          3.1.7.1.2. Aircrews shall monitor Ground Control immediately after clearing all
          active runways and continue on the parallel taxiway (Taxiway Golf) and taxi back to
          parking. A radio call is not required (silent taxi). Contact Ground Control and
          request to back-taxi if required. Assistance from Ground Control shall be provided
          upon establishing 2-way communication initiated by either the controller or pilot.
          3.1.7.1.3. Aircraft exiting the runway shall give way to aircraft taxiing on the parallel
          taxiway (Taxiway Golf). Aircraft on the parallel taxiway that are returning to parking
          shall give way to aircraft taxiing for departure out of the parking ramp.
          3.1.7.1.4. Ground Control may provide additional direction when required (e.g.
          emergencies, Distinguished Visitors, etc.). If needed, Ground Control will contact
          taxiing aircraft by type and airfield position. Aircraft commanders must know their
26                                             LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


        position at all times and acknowledge Ground Control with callsign when contacted.
        Example, ―T-1 on Taxiway Golf approaching Echo, give way to emergency
        vehicles.‖
        3.1.7.1.5. Under normal operations, T38s will not exit runway 13C at taxiway E
        unless directed by Tower. Aircrews may expect an extensive delay if exiting 13C at
        Echo while Honcho controls the inside runway.
     3.1.7.2. Taxiways Alpha, Echo, Foxtrot, Golf and Juliet (day time only) are authorized
     for use by any aircraft. Taxiways B, C and D are only authorized for AETC T6, T1 and
     T38 aircraft. Taxiway Hotel is authorized for all C-130 or smaller aircraft. NOTE:
     Taxiways Bravo and Charlie are closed between RWY 13C/31C and RWY 13L/31R.
     3.1.7.3. AMOPS will determine the taxi route and parking spots for transient aircraft and
     will ensure protection from jet thrust IAW the AMOPS parking plan.
     3.1.7.4. The taxi route for outbound aircraft larger than a T-1 will be Taxiway Golf to
     Taxiways Alpha or Foxtrot as appropriate.
     3.1.7.5. Runway 13 in use: No aircraft will hold east of RWY 13R for departure behind a
     heavy aircraft.
     3.1.7.6. C-130 or larger aircraft shall not taxi on Taxiway Golf abeam Taxiway Golf 1
     with any aircraft on Taxiway Golf 1 due to insufficient wingtip clearance.
     3.1.7.7. Runway 31 in use: No aircraft will hold on taxiways Foxtrot, Hotel, or the
     southern portion of taxiway Golf behind a heavy aircraft.
     3.1.7.8. Only one T-1 aircraft, may utilize Taxiways Bravo, Charlie, Delta, or Echo at
     any given time between the center and inside runways.
     3.1.7.9. Taxiways Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, and Hotel will not be used for any
     aircraft larger than a T-1.
  3.1.8. Controlled Departure Time (CDT)
     3.1.8.1. On initial contact, aircrews requesting a Controlled Departure Time (CDT) will
     inform Ground Control. On initial contact with Ground Control for a request to taxi,
     Ground Control will add to the end of their taxi instructions ―…copy CDT‖. For CDT
     requests to be honored, the CDT must be for a time no sooner than 5 minutes from
     holding short of the departure runway.
     3.1.8.2. Aircrews and controllers will make every effort to ensure departure occurs as
     close as possible to the CDT. ―On-time‖ departure for a CDT is considered 2 minutes
     early to 0 minutes late.
  3.1.9. Runway 13 Taxi Operations.
     3.1.9.1. There will be no more than 6 T-38 aircraft or a combination of 4 T-6/T1 aircraft
     holding between runways 13R and 13C at Taxiway Alpha. Spacing allows up to 3 T-38
     aircraft per side; if any other airframe is parked on a given side, only two aircraft
     maximum may be present on that side.
     3.1.9.2. T-6s proceeding to RWY 13R will taxi via the parallel taxiway and taxiway G1,
     and then use the inside (southern) taxi line on taxiway Alpha between the parallel and
LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010                                                               27


     Rwy 13R. T-6 aircraft will enter G1 using the eastern taxi line without staggering,
     proceed to northernmost available diagonal taxi line, and auto switch to Tower/Honcho
     as appropriate once established on G1. Maintain at least 150-foot spacing on the
     preceding aircraft, until the preceding aircraft is established on a diagonal taxi line. Once
     the preceding aircraft is established on a diagonal taxi line, the aircraft in trail will then
     proceed to the adjacent diagonal taxi line.
        3.1.9.2.1. Aircraft may not taxi from a diagonal taxi line until all aircraft preceding
        them are established on the western taxi line, with at least 150-foot spacing.
        3.1.9.2.2. T-6s experiencing high amperage reading while on G1 will not delay taxi
        to Alpha, unless there are no aircraft behind them. They will proceed to Alpha as
        normal, contact Honcho/Tower, request taxi to taxiway Bravo, and remain there until
        the amperage readings are within limits for takeoff. They will then re-enter the taxi
        flow at G1 and proceed via the above guidance.
     3.1.9.3. All aircraft holding short of RWY 13R proceeding to RWY 13C will utilize the
     3 parking spots painted on the outside (northern side) of Taxiway Alpha between the
     parallel and RWY 13R. These lines provide wing tip separation for any combination of
     aircraft.
        3.1.9.3.1. Radio procedures for crossing RWY 13R en-route to RWY 13C: with
        Honcho control of 13R, switch to and await clearance from Honcho to cross (no
        request is necessary). Acknowledge clearance to cross with aircraft callsign only. If
        Tower controls RWY 13R, request crossing with Ground Control unless previously
        cleared.
        3.1.9.3.2. T-1 anti-ice checks. If Honcho controls RWY 13R, T-1s will display a
        landing light while performing an anti-ice check to signal to Honcho they are not
        ready to cross RWY 13R. When the anti-ice check is complete and ready to cross
        RWY 13R, T-1s will turn off the landing light and await clearance from Honcho to
        cross. If Tower controls RWY 13R, T-1s will coordinate the delay with them. T-1s
        will not perform anti-ice checks on Taxiway Juliet or between runways 13R and13C
        at Alpha.
  3.1.10. Runway 31 Taxi Operations
     3.1.10.1. T-6s proceeding to RWY 31C will taxi via Taxiway Foxtrot (intersection
     departure). If departing behind a T-38 or T-1, a 3-min wake-turbulence delay will be
     implemented. Aircrews may waive this wake turbulence requirement upon request IAW
     FAAO 7110.65.
     3.1.10.2. All aircraft using the full length of RWY 31C will utilize the parking spots at
     the south hammer head for holding short of RWY 31C, unless specifically cleared to
     ―Taxi up to and hold short of RWY 31C‖ or ―Cleared for takeoff, RWY 31C‖. Only
     under these two circumstances will aircraft proceed onto Taxiway Hotel.
        3.1.10.2.1. T-1 aircraft will perform anti-ice checks in these parking spots and will
        inform Tower when the check is complete.
28                                               LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


         3.1.10.2.2. These parking spots are marked for T-38 wing tip separation only. T-
         1s/T-6s must take the third line if there is another aircraft on the first line to ensure
         adequate wing tip separation.
     3.1.10.3. While taxiing for takeoff on Rwy 31L, T-6s will utilize the PMU run-up area
     on taxiway Echo. All aircraft will pull into the first available easternmost PMU run-up
     spot and stop. Note: All aircraft must utilize the PMU run-up area regardless of whether
     or not there are aircraft on the taxiway ahead of them. Aircraft will not taxi behind other
     aircraft established in the PMU run-up area.
         3.1.10.3.1. There are 4 usable spots on the Taxiway Echo run-up area. Once
         established in the parking run-up area, aircrews may side-step (i.e., taxi from one run-
         up spot to another) to utilize an open run-up spot. They are required to side-step when
         T-6 traffic has backed up onto Taxiway Golf. When planning a side-step maneuver,
         aircrews must side-step at least two parking spots to the right. Solo students are
         required three open spaces to sidestep. This will allow adequate spacing for an
         aircraft to add power and execute a right turn to establish itself on another parking
         run-up spot.
         3.1.10.3.2. Aircrew may call ready for takeoff only once established in the PMU run-
         up area. An aircraft will not proceed to the hold short line until cleared for takeoff or
         otherwise directed by the RSU. Once established on a PMU run-up spot, the
         easternmost aircraft has priority to call ―number one.‖ Once the aircraft has been
         cleared for takeoff, the next easternmost aircraft may call ready for takeoff. During
         normal operations, at no time will an aircraft pull up to the hold short line and stop.
         Aircraft directed to ―hold short‖ by the controlling agency will remain in the PMU
         run-up area until cleared for takeoff.
         3.1.10.3.3. All aircraft will Change to Honcho/Tower frequency once established on
         or past taxiway Echo.
  3.1.11. Taxiway Juliet.
     3.1.11.1. Taxiway Juliet is for daylight use only.
     3.1.11.2. For T-6 and T-38 operations, no more than two aircraft may utilize Juliet at the
     same time.
     3.1.11.3. Only one T-1 aircraft, may utilize taxiway Juliet at any given time however,
     spacing does allow one T-6, or T-38 aircraft to utilize taxiway Juliet at the same time as
     one T-1.
     3.1.11.4. The standard taxi route to RWY 13C is via Taxiway Alpha. If desired,
     Ground/Honcho will direct aircraft to taxi to RWY 13C via Juliet. Aircraft will be
     launched in the same sequence as if using Taxiway Alpha. Aircraft taxiing to RWY 13C
     via Juliet will advise Honcho ―(Callsign) XX for Juliet.‖ Honcho RSU controller will
     ensure traffic spacing allows the T-1 to safely access Taxiway Juliet. If Tower controls
     RWY 13R, request crossing with Ground Control unless previously cleared and taxi to
     Alpha or Juliet as directed.
     3.1.11.5. If the full runway length is required at any other time, advise Tower on initial
     contact. T-1s will not perform formation takeoffs from Taxiway Juliet.

3.2. Ground Safety Procedures
   3.2.1. Aircraft Towing Procedures. Standard towing through the sterile area between
   taxiway Golf and RWY 13R/31L does not require prior coordination. Maintenance
   personnel will be escorted by TA or AMOPS when entering the CMA.
   3.2.2. Emergency Egress Procedures. If able, advise Tower or ground of your location.
   Include parking spot if applicable.
   3.2.3. Engine Test/Run-up Procedures. Engine tests and run-ups will be requested through
   the ground controller on frequency 275.8 or the RAMP NET and include the aircraft’s tail
   number and location. Personnel will advise the ground controller when run-ups and tests
   have been completed.
   3.2.4. Hot Pit Refueling. Hot pit refueling is not authorized at Laughlin AFB.
   3.2.5. Airfield Snow Removal Operations.        Airfield snow removal is not required at
   Laughlin AFB.

                                           Chapter 4

                                   FLYING OPERATIONS

4.1. Runway Use.
   4.1.1. Whenever the weather is below 1500’AGL/3, the Tower will control all runways. The
   active runways at Laughlin and Wizard will remain the same. RWY 13C/31C is the primary
   instrument runway. RWYs 13 L/C/R are designated as the calm wind runways.
       4.1.1.1. To enhance controller training, Tower will normally control 13L/31R during T-
       38 statuses of Instruments, Restricted Patterns Straight-In Only, and Restricted Patterns.
   4.1.2. VFR Weather Minimums. IAW the Airman’s Information Manual (AIM), basic VFR
   is established at 1000’ ceiling and 3 miles visibility for Class C airspace.
   4.1.3. Simultaneous Parallel Runway Operations. Rwy 13C/31C and Rwy 13R/31L
   centerlines are only 500 feet apart (non-standard for simultaneous same direction operation).
   Once established on final approach, aircraft will remain aligned with Rwy 13C/31C to avoid
   traffic landing on Rwy 13R/31L, pattern altitude 2100’, and traffic landing on Rwy 13L/31R,
   pattern altitude 2600’.
       4.1.3.1. Simultaneous parallel runway operations are approved between RWY 13R/31L
       and RWY 13C/31C during VFR conditions for military aircraft only by waiver from
       AFFSA.
       4.1.3.2. Simultaneous base turns to Rwy 13C/31C and Rwy 13R/31L are not permitted
       during simultaneous runway operations, except in emergency situations, during which
       traffic advisories will be issued to all aircraft involved.
       4.1.3.3. Rwy 13R/31L Overshoot Procedures.
          4.1.3.3.1. An overshoot is when the observed flight path of a T-6 on base or final to
          Rwy 13R/31L is, or appears to be, in Tower’s airspace.
          4.1.3.3.2. In the event an aircraft overshoots final to Rwy 13R/31L and enters
          Tower’s airspace, the following procedures will be used by Honcho RSU:
              4.1.3.3.2.1. Honcho RSU will announce on guard ―TOWER, HONCHO,
              Overshoot, (aircraft location).‖
              4.1.3.3.2.2. Tower will issue traffic calls/alerts to affected airborne aircraft under
              its control. Tower will issue wake turbulence cautionary advisories as
              appropriate. Tower controllers are not responsible for separation of simultaneous
              aircraft operations to the center and inside runways when the RSU pattern is
              active. The responsibility for separation in this situation rests with the
              participating aircrews.
   4.1.4. Intersection Departure Information & Feet Remaining. The following charts indicate
   which airframes are authorized intersection departures and provide feet remaining for
   intersection departures:

4.2. MARSA Procedures: MARSA has been approved IAW FAAO 7610.4 para 1-4-8 and AFI
13-201 AETC Sup. para 3.6.1.6. and para 7.3.1.1. The approval letter is on file at 47
OSS/OSOR. ATC’s sole responsibility concerning the use of MARSA is to separate military
aircraft engaged in MARSA operations from other nonparticipating IFR aircraft. Separation
from VFR traffic and from aircraft engaged in MARSA operations is not provided by ATC.
   4.2.1. Departures: MARSA shall apply between simultaneous instrument departures of 47
   FTW aircraft from Runways 13R/C/L and Runways 31L/C/R IAW the following:
      4.2.1.1. Simultaneous departures from Rwy 13R/31L shall only be conducted when T-6s
      are Restricted Patterns or better. Tower will provide initial RADAR separation from
      aircraft departing from Rwy 13R/31L and aircraft departing other runways during
      Instrument Status.
      4.2.1.2. Aircraft departing from Rwy 13R/31L on the QWAIL ROUTE must remain
      clear of clouds until ATC establishes radio and RADAR contact, and the aircraft is
      established on the 133 radial at 9 DME (Rwy 13) or the 298 radial at 5 DME (Rwy 31).
      4.2.1.3. MARSA shall terminate when aircraft on the QWAIL ROUTE are established
      on the 133 radial at 9 DME (Rwy 13) or the 298 radial at 5 DME (Rwy 31) with radio
      and RADAR contact and approved ATC separation is established. For aircraft departing
      on a published instrument departure, MARSA shall terminate when aircraft are
      established on the outbound heading or track for the assigned route.
      4.2.1.4. In the event that complying with crossing restrictions will place the aircraft in
      IMC prior to the MARSA termination point, the aircrew will advise ATC that they are
      unable to comply with the crossing restrictions. Specific ATC instructions prior to
      reaching the MARSA termination point do not constitute a cancellation of MARSA.
32                                              LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


     4.2.1.5. Being informed you are ―RADAR contact‖ does not mean MARSA is
     terminated.
  4.2.2. Simultaneous Instrument Approaches are defined as one aircraft or formation inside
  the FAF on a straight-in instrument approach or inside of 4 miles on an IFR visual approach
  to the center runway and another aircraft inside the FAF on a circling approach (GPS-B) to
  the inside runway. At no time shall both aircraft involved in simultaneous instrument
  approaches be conducting an approach to the same runway of intended landing.
     4.2.2.1. Simultaneous instrument approaches shall be conducted by 47 FTW aircraft
     utilizing the GPS-B circling approach to RWY 13R/31L and straight-in instrument
     approaches (ILS or RNAV/GPS) or IFR visual approaches to RWY 13C/31C.
     4.2.2.2. MARSA shall apply between 47 FTW aircraft inside the published FAF for the
     specified straight-in instrument approach to RWY 13C/31C (or 4 miles for an IFR visual
     approach) and aircraft inside MINNM on the GPS-B circling approach to RWY 13R/31L.
     4.2.2.3. MARSA shall apply between 47 FTW aircraft departing on a published
     instrument departure or the QWAIL ROUTE, or that have gone missed approach from a
     straight-in instrument approach to RWY 13C/31C, and 47 FTW aircraft that are on, or
     have gone missed approach from, the GPS-B circling approach to RWY 13R/31L.
     4.2.2.4. MARSA shall end between simultaneous instrument approaches when either the
     aircraft on approach to RWY 13C/31C lands, the aircraft conducting the GPS-B circling
     approach to RWY 13R/31L lands, or in the event of a missed approach, the aircraft on the
     missed approach is issued specific control instructions by ATC and is clear of any
     conflicts.
  4.2.3. GPS-B Circling Approach. This procedure, in conjunction with the application of
  MARSA, allows simultaneous instrument approaches to be conducted by 47 FTW aircraft to
  both the center and inside runway during simultaneous instrument weather status.
     4.2.3.1. Weather minimums are 2100’ MSL (1000’ AGL) and 3 mile visibility as
     reported by the official base weather observation. A pattern check may not be conducted
     if the base weather is reported as less than 1000’/3 because the field is officially IFR and
     MARSA cannot be applied between aircraft conducting simultaneous instrument
     approaches.
     4.2.3.2. Once inside of MINNM on the GPS-B circling approach to RWY 13R/31L,
     aircraft must remain clear of clouds and are MARSA with 47 FTW aircraft departing on a
     published instrument departure or the QWAIL ROUTE. If unable to maintain clear of
     clouds inside MINNM, advise ATC and standby for further guidance.
     4.2.3.3. Once inside of MINNM on the GPS-B circling approach to RWY 13R/31L,
     aircraft are MARSA with 47 FTW aircraft inside the published FAF for the specified
     straight-in instrument approach to RWY 13C/31C (or 4 miles for an IFR visual
     approach).
     4.2.3.4. MARSA between simultaneous instrument approaches shall end when either the
     aircraft on approach to RWY 13C/31C lands, the aircraft conducting the GPS-B circling
     approach to RWY 13R/31L lands, or in the event of a missed approach, the aircraft on the
LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010                                                               33


      missed approach is issued specific control instructions by ATC and is clear of any
      conflicts.
      4.2.3.5. Aircraft may, with RAPCON and Tower watch supervisor approval, coordinate
      for climb out to another approach if conducting a GPS-B circling approach for the
      purpose of determining if the weather supports a simultaneous instrument status. Aircraft
      climbing out for a GPS-B approach will climb out as directed by ATC and await further
      instructions.
4.3. Takeoffs and Departures
   4.3.1. Aircraft departing from the outside runway will receive IFR release from Lariat RSU.
   Lariat RSU requests this release from Tower. Upon receipt of an IFR release, Lariat has two
   minutes in which to launch the aircraft and provide a ―Resume‖ call to Tower. If Tower does
   not receive a ―Resume‖ call within the two-minute window, the IFR clearance is void and
   Lariat is responsible for the VFR separation of the respective aircraft.
      4.3.1.1. Solo students will add "Seat Armed" to their takeoff clearance read-back, once
      the canopy has been lowered, to Tower or RSU, whichever is applicable.
      4.3.1.2. Formation solos will confirm their seat is armed on the radio, once the canopy
      has been lowered, with the IP in the formation. The student does not need to make a "seat
      armed" call during his/her takeoff clearance.
   4.3.2. On other than Instrument status, all aircraft shall cross departure end of all runways at
   or below 1600’ MSL in order to maintain at least 500 feet separation from overhead traffic
   patterns unless cleared otherwise.
   4.3.3. All aircraft, local and transient, on departure or VFR go-around will cross 2 DME at
   or below 3000’ MSL to ensure separation from the civilian corridor, then as cleared by
   approach.
   4.3.4. T-1/T-38 aircrews will change to departure/approach frequency after passing the
   departure end of the runway. T-6 aircrews will change to departure/approach frequency 1
   NM past the departure end of the runway.
   4.3.5. If barrier engagement is anticipated during an abort, aircrews will call ―BARRIER,
   BARRIER, BARRIER.‖ When tower controls both the center and outside runways, and
   barrier engagement is anticipated, aircrews will state ―BARRIER, BARRIER, BARRIER‖
   and will add ―CENTER‖ or ―OUTSIDE‖ if time and conditions permit. Tower personnel
   will raise both barriers if ―CENTER‖ or ―OUTSIDE‖ is not transmitted, or if confusion
   exists. In case both barriers are raised, aircraft should cross the departure end of 13L/31R
   and 13C/31C at or above 26 feet to avoid accidental barrier engagement.
   4.3.6. Preferred Departure Routes. 47 FTW aircraft departing for the Ranch Areas shall fly
   the LAEKE, TAELR, or HJORN ROUTE as assigned by ATC. The HJORN ROUTE shall
   be flown when departing for the BURR MOA. 47 FTW aircraft shall fly the LAUGHLIN
   ONE departure to join the LAEKE, TAELR, or HJORN ROUTE. 47 FTW aircraft departing
   for the SKI MOA’s shall fly the PIIPE or FORDE ROUTE as assigned by ATC. During
   Instrument Status, 47 FTW aircraft shall fly the LAUGHLIN ONE departure to join the
   QWAIL ROUTE.
34                                            LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


     4.3.6.1. 47 FTW aircraft not using a pre-approved stereo FP to depart Laughlin’s
     airspace shall file for the LAEKE ROUTE, the TAELR ROUTE, or the HINKO ONE
     departure.
     4.3.6.2. 47 FTW aircraft departing on a published departure route that are unable to
     comply with the published altitude crossing restrictions will notify RAPCON upon initial
     contact.
     4.3.6.3. RAPCON shall omit the ―LAUGHLIN ONE departure‖ when assigning the
     LAEKE, TAELR, HJORN, or QWAIL ROUTE to 47 FTW aircraft since it is understood
     that they shall fly the LAUGHLIN ONE departure to join these routes to help minimize
     frequency congestion.
  4.3.7. Standard Climb-out Procedures. When directed to, ―CLIMBOUT AS PUBLISHED
  TO TOWER/LARIAT/HONCHO/HJORN/SYCAMORE/MINNM,‖ comply with the
  following:
     4.3.7.1. Climb-out to HJORN: Fly the LAUGHLIN ONE departure, HJORN ROUTE
     (maintain 5000’), expect vectors to final. Upon completion of the low approach/touch-
     and-go to the center runway, all aircraft automatically change to Arrival control
     frequency.
     4.3.7.2. To Enter VFR Pattern. RAPCON will instruct aircraft requesting to enter the
     VFR pattern after an approach to ―CLIMBOUT TO TOWER/LARIAT/HONCHO AS
     PUBLISHED‖ Once past departure end, maintain 500’AGL squawk appropriate code
     and contact RSU/Tower, as appropriate.
     4.3.7.3. Pattern Entry for HIGHWAY DEPARTURE. If you intend to depart on the
     Highway Departure after a RADAR pattern, you must inform the approach controller of
     your intentions: ―TIGER XX, ILS OPTION HONCHO, HIGHWAY DEPARTURE.
     4.3.7.4. RADAR Delay Procedure. Aircraft requesting a RADAR pattern delay prior to
     departure will call clearance delivery and request the ―RADAR delay‖ procedure. Fly the
     LAUGHLIN ONE departure, HJORN ROUTE (maintain 5000’), expect vectors to final.
     4.3.7.5. Sycamore Climbout to Facilitate Departure Flow: When traffic conditions
     dictate the need for the ―Sycamore Climbout‖ to expedite the flow of traffic, Tower or
     RAPCON will clear aircraft to ―CLIMBOUT AS PUBLISHED TO SYCAMORE.‖ On
     Runway 13, at the departure end of the runway, TURN LEFT HEADING 360,
     MAINTAIN 3000, expect vectors to final. On Runway 31, at the departure end of the
     runway, TURN RIGHT HEADING 090, MAINTAIN 3000, expect vectors to final.
     Upon completion of the low approach/touch-and-go, all aircraft automatically change to
     Arrival control frequency. The Sycamore Climbout may only be utilized when the Tower
     controls both the center and outside runways.
     4.3.7.6. MINNM Climbout to Facilitate Departure Flow (T-6 aircraft only): When traffic
     conditions dictate the need for the ―MINNM Climbout‖ to expedite the flow of traffic,
     Tower or RAPCON will clear aircraft to ―CLIMBOUT AS PUBLISHED TO MINNM.‖
     On Runway 13, at the departure end of the runway, TURN RIGHT HEADING 150,
     MAINTAIN 3000, expect vectors on course. On Runway 31, at the departure end of the
     runway, TURN LEFT HEADING 150, MAINTAIN 3000, expect vectors on course. On
LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010                                                            35


     climbout, all aircraft automatically change to departure. The ―MINNM Climbout‖ may
     only be utilized when the Tower controls both the center and inside runways.
     4.3.7.7. RADAR Breakouts. This procedure is used to exit Lariat’s pattern and pick up
     an IFR clearance when a standard release from the outside runway is not available.
     Aircraft planning to conduct a RADAR breakout shall notify Lariat as soon as possible.
     Transmit on Lariat’s frequency ―CALLSIGN, LOCATION, RADAR BREAKOUT‖.
     Lariat will notify RAPCON as soon as it is known that an aircraft will be conducting a
     RADAR breakout so RAPCON can plan accordingly.
         4.3.7.7.1. When departing the pattern on a RADAR breakout, fly heading 045 and
         maintain VFR at 3100’. When passing the VFR entry point contact Arrival and state
         your request.    ―ARRIVAL, CALLSIGN, RADAR BREAKOUT, REQUEST
         VECTORS ILS/GPS/RANCH AREAS.‖ If RAPCON is unable to provide an IFR
         clearance due to area saturation or heavy departure/arrival traffic, RAPCON shall
         report unable and state the reason. Example: ―CALLSIGN, ARRIVAL, UNABLE
         DUE TO MOA SATURATION, MAINTAIN VFR, CONTACT LARIAT.‖ If
         RAPCON denies your request, maintain VFR and re-enter Lariat’s pattern through
         the VFR entry point.
         4.3.7.7.2. RAPCON may call Lariat and/or Tower to inform them that they cannot
         accept RADAR breakouts due to area saturation or during heavy traffic to avoid
         further airspace congestion. Do not conduct RADAR breakouts if RAPCON has
         cancelled RADAR delays or automatic/Lariat releases.
  4.3.8. Breakout/Go Around/ Missed Approach Procedures
     4.3.8.1. Compliance with the procedures set forth in the applicable facility operating
     instructions is mandatory
         4.3.8.1.1. When the ELP airspace is active, and a breakout is necessary for aircraft on
         final, the aircraft will be instructed to, ―FLY RUNWAY HEADING, CLIMB AND
         MAINTAIN THREE-THOUSAND.‖
         4.3.8.1.2. DELETED
         4.3.8.1.3. T-6 RWY 13 DRT Local Climbout (south flow, dual or better only.) If
         requesting another radar approach; perform a climbing right turn to 4000 feet heading
         310 or as assigned. If entering Honcho’s pattern after flying the approach, contact
         approach and cancel IFR. Climb to 2100 feet and fly runway heading until abeam
         VFR entry. Squawk 0222 and contact Honcho.
             4.3.8.1.3.1. The published missed approach is not authorized unless specifically
             requested by the aircrew and authorized by RAPCON.
  4.3.9. Runway Clearing. Do not fly over aircraft on the runway below 500’ AGL unless the
  aircraft is a full-stop on a RSU controlled runway. If necessary, clear the runway as follows:
     4.3.9.1. On 13L/31R: Clear to the east of the runway no farther than the closed runway
     intersection.
     4.3.9.2. On 13C/31C: Clear to the east of the runway. Do not over-fly the outside
     runway.
36                                              LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


     4.3.9.3. On 13R/31L: Clear to the west of the runway. Do not fly in close proximity to,
     west of, or over the Tower.
  4.3.10. QWAIL ROUTE Separation Procedures
     4.3.10.1. Honcho shall provide at least one minute separation between single ship
     departures and at least two minute separation between formations to ensure aircraft have
     the minimum required IFR separation on the QWAIL ROUTE when contacting approach.
     Aircraft not separated by the appropriate separation and requesting IFR service will be
     instructed as follows: ―Insufficient radar separation, maintain VFR, contact Honcho‖. At
     this point the aircraft will maintain VFR and return to Honcho’s pattern. The 1 or 2
     minute separation requirements do not apply to VFR aircraft departing Honcho’s pattern
     for Wizard when Runway 13 is in use or when Runway 31 Highway Departure is in use.
     4.3.10.2. For aircraft on approach to RWY 13C/31C requesting the QWAIL ROUTE,
     Tower will notify Honcho when the aircraft is approximately four miles on final.
     Honcho will ensure one minute spacing, measured from the departure end of the runway,
     between aircraft requesting departure from their runway and aircraft departing on the
     QWAIL ROUTE from RWY 13C/31C.
     4.3.10.3. To comply with MARSA requirements, aircraft departing an RSU controlled
     runway on the QWAIL ROUTE must remain clear of clouds until the departure control
     facility establishes radio and RADAR contact, and the aircraft is established on the 133
     radial at 9 DME (Rwy 13) or the 298 radial at 5 DME (Rwy 31).
        4.3.10.3.1. In the event that following ATC instructions will place the aircrew in
        IMC prior to termination of MARSA, the aircrew will advise ATC that they are
        unable to comply with the instructions. Specific ATC instructions prior to reaching
        the MARSA termination points do not constitute a cancellation of MARSA.
        4.3.10.3.2. When the flying status is Instrument/GPS-B, single ship T-6 aircraft will
        fly the "Take-Off RWY 13/L/C/R or 31L/C/R Instrument Status" portion of the
        QWAIL ROUTE depicted in the IFG. Flights are automatically cleared on the default
        flight plan unless a change to the clearance is coordinated by the pilot or controlling
        agency IAW para 4.11.3.
  4.3.11. IFR Departure from RSU Controlled Runways/Patterns
     4.3.11.1. To prevent two aircraft from being at the departure end without IFR separation,
     Lariat/Honcho will obtain an IFR Release from the Tower for all aircraft departing on an
     IFR clearance from their pattern. T-38 solo students departing off of the outside runway
     will adhere to the procedures set forth in para 4.3.3.
     4.3.11.2. Unless directed by Tower, Honcho does not need an IFR release for aircraft
     departing on the QWAIL ROUTE on a local sortie. Cross-country and out-and-back
     sorties do require an IFR release.
     4.3.11.3. IFR Release procedures.
        4.3.11.3.1. Tower is responsible for initial departure separation.
        4.3.11.3.2. RSU will state the position of departure aircraft when requesting release.
LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010                                                             37


         4.3.11.3.3. Tower will issue restrictions as needed with the release, i.e. ―Maintain
         6000‖ or ―Low Approach Only‖.
         4.3.11.3.4. All released aircraft will conduct a ―Touch and Go‖ landing unless
         otherwise coordinated.
         4.3.11.3.5. RSU shall notify Tower with a ―Resume‖ call which means departure
         aircraft is on the go.
         4.3.11.3.6. Only one aircraft shall be released at any given time.
  4.3.12. VFR Departure
     4.3.12.1. All aircraft squawk as assigned and comply with any departure instructions
     issued prior to takeoff. T-6s departing on VFR flight plans will normally depart from the
     inside runway. If a T-6 desires to depart from the center runway, advise Clearance
     Delivery.
     4.3.12.2. Aircrews will contact departure control for Class C airspace service.
  4.3.13. IMC Instrument Trail Departures. This refers to 1 minute interval departures for T-
  1s and 20 second instrument trail for T-38s and T-6s.
     4.3.13.1. Aircraft conducting formation IMC instrument trail departures are MARSA
     with other members of their formation throughout the departure. RAPCON will only
     provide separation between the formation and aircraft not in the formation. It is
     imperative that crews adhere to prescribed procedures to maintain vertical clearance from
     other members of their formation until visual contact can be maintained.
     4.3.13.2. When contacting Clearance Delivery, crews will advise ATC of their intention
     to fly an IMC instrument trail departure. Include the number of aircraft in the formation,
     i.e. "DIRTY 11 flight of two, 1 minute interval, IFR to San Angelo ready to copy, ," or ,
     "Sweep 01, TALON 1, ready to copy, four by 20 sec instrument trail." When contacting
     tower, advise of intentions to conduct the interval takeoff and, if needed, request an
     altitude block, i.e., "Sweep 01, ready for takeoff, four by 20 sec instrument trail, request
     block altitude (give a specific altitude request). If a block altitude is requested, tower
     must coordinate with the RAPCON for a release.
     4.3.13.3. The lead aircraft of the formation will squawk as assigned, and the last aircraft
     of the formation will squawk 0000 until rejoined. Lead aircraft will contact RAPCON on
     departure with altitude passing in order to verify mode C.
     4.3.13.4. If assigned an intermediate level off without a block of altitude, lead should
     coordinate for a block unless visual contact is established within the formation. If
     RAPCON is unable to assign a block of altitude sufficient for the formation, lead should
     obtain vectors from RAPCON for separation within the formation or coordinate for
     separate clearances for each aircraft. If separation of aircraft is ever in doubt, crews
     should consider squawking 7700 and declaring an emergency. If assigned an
     intermediate level off in conjunction with takeoff clearance, i.e., "Sweep 01, cleared for
     takeoff, 20 second interval, climb and maintain 6000," lead will not accept takeoff
     clearance without a clearance for a block of altitude unless the formation will have visual
     contact prior to reaching the level off altitude.
 38                                               LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


      4.3.13.5. Formations should not be cleared off the departure ground track until visual
      contact has been established. If vectors or a reroute is required prior to visual contact,
      lead must obtain vectors for separation or coordinate for separate clearances for each
      aircraft.
      4.3.13.6. Once the formation is able to maintain visual contact, notify RAPCON. Rejoin
      shall be accomplished prior to 50 DME. Advise RAPCON as early as possible if the
      rejoin will be delayed beyond this distance.
   4.3.14. SR-283 Departures. When RWY 13 is in use, T-6s will use RWY 13R for SR-283.
   When RWY 31 is in use, T-6s will request RWY 31C departure for SR-283 from Clearance
   Delivery.
4.4. Area Procedures
   4.4.1. General Area Procedures. Entry into all Laughlin assigned areas is granted to
   Laughlin-based aircraft on IFR flight plans by either RAPCON or Houston Center. Traffic
   permitting, the controlling agency may clear aircraft direct from any point to an area/fix.
      4.4.1.1. While maintaining 3 miles visibility and clear of clouds, 47 FTW aircraft
      operating in the Laughlin MOAs are provided ―Merging Target Separation‖ (targets do
      not touch on the RADAR controller’s display) from applicable participating aircraft
      while established in the MOAs IAW FAAO 7610.4 12-10-11. When established in the
      areas, pilots will advise the controller if unable to maintain 3 miles visibility and clear of
      clouds. Standard IFR separation will then be provided until the pilot advises 3 miles
      visibility and clear of clouds can be maintained in the area. As necessary, wingmen will
      squawk 0000 while in the MOA. A participating aircraft is "any aircraft" planning
      operations within the MOA (i.e., aircraft on an IFR cross country flight plan that does not
      intend to delay in the MOA would be afforded standard IFR separation).
      4.4.1.2. T38/T1 only. Unless stated otherwise, aircrews will climb and maintain FL 230
      unless given an intermediate level off at the time clearance direct is given.
      4.4.1.3. Use the local altimeter setting in all Ski, Ranch, and Burr areas. During
      departure and cruise to assigned area, use 29.92 at or above FL180. Maintain 29.92
      while in the PECOS areas. Upon departing your assigned altitude or upon entering the
      area set your altimeter to the local setting. When departing your assigned area, leave the
      local altimeter setting in or reset to 29.92, as appropriate for the altitude flown. When the
      Laughlin local altimeter setting is below 29.92, all areas will be capped below the normal
      altitude ceiling.
      4.4.1.4. The following phraseology will be used by the controlling agency to provide
      assistance to pilots in maintaining their assigned areas. Acknowledge all instructions by
      stating callsign.
          4.4.1.4.1. ―CS, WORK (direction).‖ As soon as practical, the aircraft/flight will turn
          toward the direction specified via the shortest route.
          4.4.1.4.2. ―CS, WORK (direction) IMMEDIATELY.‖ The aircraft/flight will
          interrupt the present maneuver and immediately turn via the shortest route toward the
          direction specified.
LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010                                                         39


     4.4.1.5. MOA Scheduling. The Laughlin MOA's will be scheduled NLT Friday 1630
     prior to week of execution by 47OSS/OSOR. The MOA will be scheduled according to
     the following rules for the Laughlin 1 MOA (L1M), Laughlin 2 MOA(L2M), and
     Laughlin 3 MOA(L3M):
        4.4.1.5.1. The L1M will be scheduled from the first T-1 or T-38 take off time
        (whichever is earlier) to 15 minutes before Wing Airfield Closure during weekday
        daylight hours. It will close at official sunset during night weeks.
        4.4.1.5.2. The L2M will be scheduled from first takeoff (any airframe) until 15
        minutes prior to Wing Airfield Closure. This MOA will stay open during operating
        night hours and during the cross country return window on the weekends to provide
        an opportunity for additional training and emergency situations where a MOA is
        required.
        4.4.1.5.3. L3M will be scheduled in the same operating window as the L2M for
        weekday daylight operations and in conjunction with the AMRAAM as needed. It
        will close at official sunset during night weeks unless being utilized in conjunction
        with the AMRAAM.
        4.4.1.5.4. Should a need arise to schedule airspace/MTRs after 1630 on Fridays (e.g.:
        late changes to weekend flying plan), flying squadrons will notify the OSS ASAP.
        The OSS/CC will validate FTS requests. The OSS will make every attempt to
        accommodate validated flying squadron requests. Notify OG/CC ASAG if unable to
        fulfill a validated request.
  4.4.2. Ranch and SKI Area Procedures
     4.4.2.1. Ranch Areas
        4.4.2.1.1. The Ranch areas may be divided vertically into two blocks: 9,000’ MSL -
        15,000’ MSL (Low Block), 16,000’ MSL - 22,000’ MSL (High Block, Areas 1-4)
        and 16,000’ MSL – 21,500’ MSL (High Block, Areas 5-10). For altimeter settings
        29.41 to 28.92 the top of the high areas will be capped at 21,000’ MSL. For altimeter
        settings 29.42 to 29.91 the top of the high areas will be capped at 21,500’ MSL. If a
        High or Low block is not specified, clearance includes full block (9,000’ MSL -
        22,000’ MSL in Areas 1-4 and 9,000’ MSL – 21,500’ MSL in Areas 5-10). If
        assigning a block, RAPCON will state "CS, CLEARED RANCH XX
        {HIGH/LOW}." If cleared to a low block, additional level-off altitudes or altitude
        restrictions will be given by RAPCON.
        4.4.2.1.2. Ranch Areas. Unless otherwise directed, the normal area uses are: Contact
        – 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10; Formation – 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.
        4.4.2.1.3. 87 FTS Solo students shall receive priority for Ranch Areas 1-4.
        4.4.2.1.4. T-1s will normally be assigned Ranch High or Low blocks, unless "FULL
        BLOCK" is requested.
        4.4.2.1.5. T-1s will normally be assigned the outer areas of the Ranch MOA and T-
        38s will normally be assigned the inner areas.
     4.4.2.2. SKI Areas
40                                              LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


        4.4.2.2.1. The SKI areas are divided vertically into two blocks: 7,000’ MSL - 12,000’
        MSL (Low Block), 15,000’ MSL - 22,000’ MSL (High Block). For altimeter settings
        29.41 to 28.92 the top of the high areas will be capped at 21,000’ MSL’. For
        altimeter settings 29.42 to 29.91 the top of the high areas will be capped at 21,500’
        MSL. When being cleared to an area, RAPCON will state "CS, CLEARED AREA
        XX {HIGH/LOW}." A High/Low Area can be requested and will include 7,000’
        MSL – 22,000’ MSL. When being cleared to a High/Low Area, RAPCON will state
        "CS, CLEARED AREA XX HIGH LOW."
        4.4.2.2.2. SKI Areas. Unless otherwise directed, the normal area uses are: Contact -
        1, 2, 6, 7, 9 and 10; Instrument - 3, 4, and 5 (Instrument East), 9 and 10 (Instrument
        South); Formation - 3, 4 and 5; Any type of sortie can use Area 8.
        4.4.2.2.3. On the PIIPE Route once at or beyond 15 DME or on the FORDE Route
        established on the 15 DME Arc and level at 13,000’ MSL, aircrew may proceed
        direct to the lateral limits of the assigned area unless otherwise specified by
        RAPCON. When within the lateral limits of the area, or adjacent to the area on the
        assigned transition, request climb/descent and/or left/right turn into the area. When
        within the lateral and vertical limits of the area, automatically switch to area discrete
        frequency.
     4.4.2.3. When given the instruction ―CLEARED DIRECT‖ by RAPCON, continue flight
     from present position to assigned area at assigned altitude.
     4.4.2.4. DELETED
  4.4.3. Military Training Route(MTR) / Slow Route(SR) Operations
     4.4.3.1. General Information
        4.4.3.1.1. RAPCON will control entrance times for IR routes to maintain at least 10
        minutes separation between aircraft. For T-38s following T-1 aircraft, RAPCON will
        maintain at least 35 minutes separation between aircraft on the same IR route.
     4.4.3.2. Scheduling MTRs
        4.4.3.2.1. All users will schedule MTR entry times with the scheduling activity listed
        in FLIP AP/1B.
        4.4.3.2.2. Scheduling Activity Sups will coordinate with RAPCON and AMOPS
        NLT 1630 on Friday to coordinate any scheduled use of IR's or VR's on that
        weekend.
     4.4.3.3. Aircrew Responsibilities
        4.4.3.3.1. If it appears ground delays will preclude meeting your entry time,
        coordinate for a revised entry time through the Duty Desk/Sup. On initial departure,
        be prepared to give RAPCON your entry time and planned exit point/time for local IR
        routes.
        4.4.3.3.2. VR1108/VR1109. For local sorties when Laughlin weather is less than
        1500’ AGL/3, the squadron supervisor may approve flying these routes provided the
        aircrews arrive at ―LAEKE‖ with Divert Fuel. .
LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010                                                           41


4.5. Recovery and Approach Procedures
   4.5.1. Laughlin AFB Arrival Fixes. Aircraft recovering from off-station may file to any of
   the coded Arrival fixes published in the IFG (ATC prefers radial/DME from DLF vs. fix
   names).
   4.5.2. VFR Arrivals
      4.5.2.1. VFR Arrivals will contact Laughlin Arrival NLT 30 NM out with radial and
      DME. VFR Arrivals are acceptable to accomplish specific mission requirements, i.e.,
      return from low levels. Follow standard Arrivals as depicted in aircraft inflight guides
      versus canceling IFR for VFR Arrivals.
   4.5.3. Canceling IFR
      4.5.3.1. Canceling IFR does not provide an aircraft with traffic priority.
      4.5.3.2. After canceling IFR, RAPCON will acknowledge your call and if necessary,
      issue control instructions. If acknowledged with no instructions, proceed via own
      navigation to the desired fix.
      4.5.3.3. Remain on the assigned frequency and squawk code until service is terminated
      by the RAPCON. When directed, change to RSU/Tower’s frequency and squawk 0222.
   4.5.4. Approach Procedures
      4.5.4.1. The FAA defines the T-38 and T-6 as single-piloted aircraft. As a result,
      RAPCON will normally send aircraft conducting instrument approaches to Tower
      frequency at 10 NM final regardless of weather conditions. This is to allow crews to call
      for the barrier without switching frequencies on the runway.
      4.5.4.2. Only ILS, localizer, GPS or visual approaches to the center runway may be
      flown if either RSU traffic pattern is in use.
      4.5.4.3. Circling Approaches. Request a circling approach from Arrival control.
      Circling approaches will not be conducted when either RSU controls a VFR pattern.
      With the exception of GPS-B, circling approaches are not authorized west of any runway.
          4.5.4.3.1. When commencing the circle on the GPS-B, increase to and/or maintain
          200 KIAS until 1 NM prior to MINNM. Conditions permitting, pilots should not
          slow to final approach airspeed outside of 3NM from SWANT.
      4.5.4.4. Arrivals to Runway 13C/31C. To minimize arrival saturation and maximize
      aircraft flow in the RADAR pattern, T-6 should fly 200 KIAS prior to 10 NM final and
      T-38s/T-1s should fly 250 KIAS (unless the T-38s need to fly 300 KIAS for aircraft
      weight) to the maximum extent practical when:
          4.5.4.4.1. Established in the RADAR pattern.
          4.5.4.4.2. Given initial RADAR vectors off of a coded arrival, instrument approach,
          or from inside a MOA, when within 20 NM of Laughlin AFB.
      4.5.4.5. Entries to the VFR patterns from the center runway.
          4.5.4.5.1. When a T-6 on approach is planning to enter the T-6 RSU pattern, Tower
          will notify Honcho when the aircraft reaches 4 NM on the approach.
 42                                              LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


          4.5.4.5.2. Aircraft attempting to enter the VFR pattern after completion of an
          approach to the center runway will contact Lariat, Honcho or Tower (whoever
          controls the pattern) with position and request closed/crosswind (i.e.
          ―LARIAT/HONCHO/TOWER,                   CS,       CENTER,           REQUEST
          CLOSED/CROSSWIND‖). T-6 entries to the outside runway pattern from the center
          runway are allowed only when T-38 flying operations are suspended and Tower
          controls the outside runway.
          4.5.4.5.3. RSU response:
              4.5.4.5.3.1. ―CENTER, CLOSED APPROVED‖ or ―CENTER, CLEARED
              CROSSWIND.‖ Fly the pattern approved by the RSU.
              4.5.4.5.3.2. ―CENTER STANDBY / CONTINUE STRAIGHT AHEAD.‖
              Maintain runway heading and VFR at or below 1600’ until clearance is received.
          4.5.4.5.4. TOWER response IAW FAAO 7110.65:
              4.5.4.5.4.1. ―(CALLSIGN), CLOSED TRAFFIC   APPROVED‖       or
              ―(CALLSIGN), CROSSWIND APPROVED.‖ Fly the approved pattern as
              depicted in IFG.
              4.5.4.5.4.2. ―(CALLSIGN) EXTEND UPWIND/CONTINUE STRAIGHT
              AHEAD.‖ Maintain runway heading and VFR at or below 1600’ until clearance
              into the pattern is received.
      4.5.4.6. RADAR Vectors to Initial Procedures. RAPCON shall provide vectors to initial
      IAW FAAO 7110.65 for all transient aircraft and to local aircraft upon request.
      4.5.4.7. Airport Surveillance Approach (ASR) & Precision Approach (PAR) availability.
      Laughlin AFB does not have the ability to provide ASR or PAR approaches.
      4.5.4.8. Straight-in to the Center Runway. Request ―STRAIGHT-IN, [DRAG],
      [RADAR/TOWER/FULL STOP]. Expect vectors (IFR) to 10 DME final for arrival
      sequencing. Once the runway is in sight, the pilot may report the field in sight and request
      a visual alignment. If visual alignment is approved, descend to 3000MSL and remain
      outside of 10 DME until aligned with final. At 10 DME, IFR is automatically cancelled.
      4.5.4.9. Drag Procedures. Lead advises Approach Control they will drag the wingman
      one mile in trail on final by including the term ―DRAG‖ in his radio calls. Maintain
      standard formation until approaching 9 DME. Once commencing the drag, the wingman
      will squawk 0000. Do not ―drag‖ back to radar without prior coordination from
      RAPCON and Tower. Visual separation must be maintained between aircraft until on
      departure and RAPCON issues individual clearances for each aircraft.
   4.5.5. RADAR Traffic Patterns. Due to limited airspace and the proximity of an
   international border, complexity of numerous procedures and volume of traffic, there exists
   no standard RADAR traffic pattern.         RAPCON will provide services/vectors as
   required/allowed.
4.6. Pattern Procedures
   4.6.1. Restrictions. Protection of the Laughlin AFB Civilian Corridor (Figure 4.2.). Unless
   performing an ELP, regardless of status, all aircraft will cross 2 DME at or below 3000’ MSL
LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010                                                           43


   for all departures from Laughlin unless otherwise approved by ATC. Aircrews should avoid
   the civilian corridor along Highway 90, 6.4 NM east to 5 NM west transitioning through
   Class C airspace between 3600’ MSL and 4500’ MSL. This corridor is for general aviation
   aircraft to transit safely through the local operating area.
   4.6.2. Pattern breakouts for Rwy 13L/31R. Ceiling must be equal to or greater than 3600’
   MSL to breakout. Request practice breakouts from Tower before executing the maneuver. If
   required or directed to breakout, immediately turn in the direction depicted in the IFG and
   climb to 3100’ MSL before crossing other pattern ground tracks. Make an advisory radio
   call as soon as practical. ―CS, (location), BREAKING OUT‖. When clear of outside
   downwind, make a descending turn onto the VFR entry leg as depicted in the IFG. Follow
   the procedures for pattern entry from the VFR Entry Point.
   4.6.3. Pattern breakouts from a Straight-In to Rwy 13L/31R. If directed to breakout after
   descending to 2100’ MSL, but prior to 4 NM, turn toward the VFR Entry Point, maintain
   2100’ MSL and proceed to the VFR Entry Point. Once clear of outside downwind, make a
   climbing turn onto the VFR entry leg as depicted in the IFG. Follow the procedures for
   pattern entry from the VFR Entry Point.
   4.6.4. Pattern breakouts for Rwy 13R/31L. Ceiling must be equal to or greater than 3100’
   MSL to breakout. Request practice breakouts from Tower before executing the maneuver. If
   required or directed to breakout, immediately turn in the direction depicted in the IFG and
   climb to 2600’ MSL before crossing other pattern ground tracks. Make an advisory radio
   call as soon as practical. ―CS, (location), BREAKING OUT‖. When clear of outside
   downwind, make a descending turn onto the VFR entry leg as depicted in the IFG. Follow
   the procedures for pattern entry from the VFR Entry Point.
   4.6.5. Pattern breakouts from a Straight-in Rwy 13R/31L. If directed to breakout after
   descending to 1600’ MSL, but prior to 2 NM, turn toward VFR Entry Point, maintain 1600’
   MSL and proceed to VFR Entry Point. Once clear of outside downwind, make a climbing
   turn onto the VFR entry leg as depicted in the IFG. Follow the procedures for pattern entry
   from the VFR Entry Point.
4.7. T-6 Emergency Landing Patterns (ELPs)
   4.7.1. The ELP Sector is in Class C airspace and may be released by the RAPCON to
   Honcho/Tower for practice ELPs. Practice ELPs do not take precedence over IFR traffic
   transiting this airspace. Tower/RSU shall request to activate ELP Sector, (above
   Lariat/Honcho Sectors: 3100’ - 4100’ MSL within 3 NM of Laughlin) (Surface-4000’ MSL
   Wizard) upon initial T-6 request for ELP. Weather minimum for high key in ELP Sector at
   Laughlin is a ceiling 500’ above high key, remaining between 3600’ - 4600’MSL, and a
   reported flight and ground visibility of at least 3 SM. Weather minimum for high key in ELP
   Sector at Wizard is 500’ above high key, remaining between 3500’ - 4500’ MSL, and a
   reported flight and ground visibility of at least 3 SM. ELPs shall only be authorized for 47
   FTW T-6 aircraft. ELPs shall follow the same ground track as the standard overhead pattern.
   When established in the Laughlin AFB pattern, high key will be requested on initial. High
   key may be requested with Honcho from any point in the pattern if there are no more than 3
   aircraft in the pattern. RAPCON shall take control of ELP airspace when an aircraft is
   approaching the civilian corridor or VFR entry from the east and shall not authorize ELPs to
   resume until the aircraft is clear of the ELP sector. At Wizard, direct high key may be
44                                              LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


  requested from any position provided there are no more than five aircraft in the pattern. All
  ELPs at Wizard will be flown to the west. ELPs may be flown to the outside runway
  provided tower has control of the runway and there are no T-38s or T-1s in the pattern.
  4.7.2. SFO’s are not authorized at Laughlin AFB.
  4.7.3. RAPCON control of ELP Airspace
     4.7.3.1. RAPCON will retain control of the ELP Sector airspace. Honcho shall request
     control of the ELP airspace when needed for practice or actual ELPs. RAPCON will
     ensure that the airspace is clear of traffic prior to releasing the ELP airspace to the RSU.
     After the aircraft completes ELP training, Honcho will return the ELP airspace to the
     RAPCON.
     4.7.3.2. In the event RAPCON must assume the ELP Sector without prior notification
     (i.e. jet departing DRT without notice, entering Laughlin’s Class C airspace) RAPCON
     will call the controlling RSU and state, ―REQUEST IMMEDIATE RELEASE OF THE
     ELP SECTOR.‖ If the ELP Sector is sterile, the RSU will immediately release the ELP
     sector to RAPCON.
  4.7.3.3 If there are aircraft in the ELP Pattern between initial and high key or between high
  key and low key, then the RSU will immediately advise RAPCON of aircraft in the ELP
  pattern. RAPCON will ensure transitioning aircraft remains outside of Class C airspace.
  4.7.4. ELP Terminology: ―Callsign (CS), INITIAL, REQUEST HIGH KEY‖. Tower/RSU
  will respond with ―REPORT HIGH KEY‖: clearance to 3600’ to 4100’ MSL. "(CS), HIGH
  KEY": Directly over the runway at 3600’ to 4100' MSL. "REPORT LOW KEY‖: Clearance
  from tower/RSU to fly to low key. ―(CS), LOW KEY GEAR DOWN": Abeam the intended
  touchdown point. If required for sequencing, Tower/RSU will direct holding/orbit at high
  key, "(CS), HIGH KEY ORBIT": Holding will be in the same direction as pattern to be
  flown. If no response from Tower/RSU at high key, aircrews will orbit and reattempt
  contact. Aircraft will only depart high key from overhead the field and after receiving
  approval from Tower/RSU. ―REQUEST LOW KEY‖: On departure leg (same as requesting
  closed). ―LOW KEY APPROVED‖: Clearance from tower/RSU to fly to low key. ―(CS)
  HIGH DOWNWIND‖: 2600’ MSL on inside downwind. Aircrews wishing to go to Low
  Key via Initial will report ―(CS) Initial for Low Key.‖ After entering the break, the aircrew
  will climb to 2600' MSL and proceed to Low Key. The crew will not climb until they are in
  the break. To preclude an aircraft on initial going into the break with insufficient spacing
  with another aircraft proceeding to Low Key, the aircraft who proceeded to Low Key via
  Initial will report ―(CS), High Downwind‖ upon reaching 2600’ MSL.
  4.7.5. ELP cut-off points and restrictions:
     4.7.5.1. Straight-in traffic shall be outside of 5 NM final or within 1 NM final when
     clearing out of high key.
     4.7.5.2. The minimum separation standard between successive ELP aircraft is the second
     aircraft may not be cleared out of high key until the preceding aircraft reports low key.
     4.7.5.3. No aircraft will be cleared for takeoff on the same runway the ELP is being
     conducted to once the ELP aircraft departs high key.
LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010                                                             45


       4.7.5.4. Aircraft conducting a closed traffic maneuver to the same runway as the ELP
       must be turning base leg prior to the ELP aircraft leaving high key.
4.8. Night Patterns: T-1s and T-38s shall not operate in the night VFR pattern simultaneously.
T-1s should plan to accomplish night pattern work off-station. There are no restrictions to the
night radar pattern.
4.9. Bird Hazard Operations.
   4.9.1. Every low-level and off station sortie briefing will include current Avian Hazard
   Advisory System (AHAS) information. If any portion of the route/destination is forecast
   SEVERE, plan another route/destination/mission if possible. If no other options exist or the
   operations supervisor can confirm with the destination that the Bird Watch Condition is less
   than SEVERE, crews may continue planning to the destination. Flights will brief and utilize
   risk mitigation techniques listed in 11-202v3, AETC Supp.
   4.9.2. If flying a Military Training Route (MTR) that is forecast SEVERE, enter the route as
   high as practical while avoiding forecast bird activity altitudes. If bird activity is not
   observed to be SEVERE, pass this information to the SOF as soon as practical and a descent
   to lower altitude is acceptable. If bird activity is SEVERE, abort the route and broadcast on
   Guard, ―Attention all Laughlin aircraft, (Callsign) on Guard, aborting (route) at (geographic
   location) due to birds.‖ Advise the SOF as soon as possible after leaving the route.
   4.9.3. If significant bird activity is reported on an MTR, the SOF may close the route or
   portions of the route to 47 FTW aircraft. Such restriction will be passed via ATIS and the
   squadron duty desks. To reopen the route, a minimum of one hour must pass from the time it
   was reported SEVERE. The SOF will assign a wing aircraft to inspect the route. The
   aircraft will fly as high as practical within the route structure while avoiding previously
   reported/forecast altitudes of significant bird activity. Once bird activity can be determined
   the aircraft will make a report/recommendation to the SOF. The SOF will then either re-open
   the route or leave restrictions in place.
   4.9.4. Bird Watch Conditions.
       4.9.4.1. Bird Condition Low. No restrictions. Utilize standard level of vigilance.
       4.9.4.2. Bird Condition Moderate.
          4.9.4.2.1. Departure/Recovery.      Formations      will   maintain    Route/Fighting
          Wing/Tactical/Offset position below 5000’ AGL.
          4.9.4.2.2. Pattern.      Recovering formations will maintain Route/Fighting
          Wing/Tactical/Offset position until initial for an overhead pattern or established on
          final for a straight-in.
          4.9.4.2.3. MOAs. Change the flight profile to avoid bird activity and report
          conditions to the SOF.
          4.9.4.2.4. Low-level Routes. Alter headings and altitudes or abort the route. Report
          conditions to the SOF as soon as possible.
       4.9.4.3. Bird Condition Severe.
 46                                              LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


          4.9.4.3.1. If Laughlin AFB is Bird Condition Severe, the 47 OG/CC will suspend or
          terminate the appropriate flying operations with the following restrictions.
              4.9.4.3.1.1. Departure/Recovery. STOP LAUNCH for all aircraft. No takeoffs
              allowed and full-stops only.
              4.9.4.3.1.2. Pattern. When possible, formations will separate prior to arrival. If
              separating is not practicable, formations will maintain Route/Fighting
              Wing/Tactical position until entering the break for an overhead pattern.
              Formation straight-in approaches and wing landings are prohibited. Touch-and-
              gos and multiple patterns are prohibited.
          4.9.4.3.2. Wizard. Aircraft will not fly patterns at Wizard under Bird Condition
          Severe.
          4.9.4.3.3. MOAs. Change the flight profile to avoid bird activity and report
          conditions to the SOF.
          4.9.4.3.4. Low-level Routes. Abort the route and implement procedures in para
          4.9.2. through 4.9.5.
   4.9.5. Aircrew Reporting Procedures. Inflight reports should include the following
   information to the maximum extent possible: location and direction of flight, altitude, time
   of sighting, bird type, and approximate number and size (small, medium, or large). Make
   reports to the RSU, SOF, or ATC. On low-level routes, make a call in the blind on 255.4
   (VR, SR routes) or assigned frequency (IR routes). After exiting the route, make a report to
   the SOF when able. If flying on an out-and-back or cross-country mission, contact the
   squadron Sup after landing and have the Sup relay your report to the SOF.
   4.9.6. Aircrews/RSU controllers will advise the SOF of recommended conditions. The SOF
   will report the opening and any changing BWC, along with details of the report, to AMOPS.
   AMOPS will then update the Airfield Status Page with the current BWC for Laughlin and
   Wizard.
   4.9.7. The RSU will advise aircrews of the Bird Watch Condition upon initial contact.
   During Bird Watch Condition Low no Bird Watch Condition will be transmitted. Changes in
   the Bird Watch Status and/or information will be broadcast by all controlling agencies.
4.10. Flying Statuses. Refer to Figure 4.3 and Figure 4.4 for a graphical depiction of local
status requirements.
   4.10.1. Aircraft flying statuses are intended to give aircrews the information necessary to
   safely and effectively conduct their missions. The criteria listed below are not all
   encompassing; the SOF may need to improvise to adequately cover unusual circumstances.
   In such cases, the SOF should use clear language (i.e., ―T6s, Divert to Del Rio). SOF shall
   not direct a VFR status in conjunction with Instrument/GPS-Bravo status.
   4.10.2. The status is based primarily on weather. A separate ATIS entry identifies who
   controls the pattern, if other than normal (i.e., ―T38s are Restricted Solo, formation only,
   Tower controls 13L.).
LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010                                                              47


  4.10.3. Weather Dissemination and Coordination Procedures. Weather information will be
  disseminated and coordinated IAW with guidance established in Appendix 4 to Appendix H
  in LAFB Plan 505, Weather Support Plan.
  4.10.4. Status Changes
     4.10.4.1. When the SOF directs a status change, the SOF will notify all participants in
     accordance with the SOF Quick Reaction Checklist.
     4.10.4.2. Tower will broadcast status change on Ground and Tower frequencies and
     update the ATIS.
     4.10.4.3. RAPCON will broadcast status changes on all local area frequencies and have
     aircraft acknowledge by ident. If the flying status is Weather Recall, Weather Divert, or
     if there is a change in alternate, RAPCON will broadcast the status change and the
     nearest suitable alternate on all local area frequencies and on GUARD. Additionally,
     RAPCON will direct an airborne aircraft to announce the status change to low level
     aircraft when necessary.
  4.10.5. Status Suffixes. The status may include one or more suffixes. These suffixes will
  include vital information to aid aircrews with in-flight planning. The following are some
  examples, but this list is not all-inclusive.
     4.10.5.1. Weather Alert. Used to alert airborne T1s that weather at DLF is expected to
     deteriorate. The expected duration is temporary, usually due to thunderstorms or gust
     fronts, and should improve prior to the scheduled T-1 recoveries. T-1s may continue
     with their mission, but will recover with divert fuel (ensure a T-1 alternate is designated).
     Consider the potential delays due to recovering T-6s and T-38s first.
     4.10.5.2. (Location) Alternate. When an alternate is required, the alternate base will be
     appended to the status. Example: ―T-38s are Instruments, Kelly Alternate.‖
     4.10.5.3. Pattern Only
     4.10.5.4. Gusty Wind Procedures. See applicable aircraft directives.
     4.10.5.5. Stop Launch. The reason, expected duration, and instructions for airborne
     aircraft may be included.
     4.10.5.6. If the Rio Arrival is not available due to low ceilings in the vicinity of the Rio
     ground-track, but the Honcho pattern is available (Dual or Restricted Patterns), the SOF
     may direct T-6 recoveries to the center runway via an instrument approach. The aircrew
     may then request the option to turn crosswind to Honcho (i.e. ―Rattler 01 requests vectors
     visual alignment to 13C option Honcho‖). Conditions must allow for T-38 recoveries
     without use of the center runway.
         4.10.5.6.1. The T-38 primary recovery method cannot be via the center runway (must
         use ZADOM XX arrival or West Fork/Fort Clark).
            4.10.5.6.1.1. T-38 status cannot be Straight In Only. If T-38 status is Restricted
            Patterns, the ZADOM XX arrival must be useable.
     4.10.5.7. Time periods. The instrument window times may be included (e.g., ―T-6
     Instruments 0800-1000, T-38 Instruments 1000-1200‖).
48                                               LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


     4.10.5.8. Lightning Procedures.
         4.10.5.8.1. Lightning Observed within 10NM of Laughlin AFB: If airborne, pilots
         will monitor guard for Recall/Divert Options. If on the ground, pilots will monitor
         guard and contact the SOF. Continued operations will be directed by the SOF. Ramp
         personnel should keep movement minimized.
         4.10.5.8.2. Lightning Observed within 5NM of Laughlin AFB: If airborne, pilots
         will contact the SOF. The decision to hold/divert/proceed will be directed by the
         SOF. If on the ground, all personnel will cease all outside activity and seek shelter.
         Aircraft will clear the runway and hold their position in the EOR/ramp/taxiway.
         Aircraft will not taxi into a parking spot without a ground marshal. Aircrew will
         follow SOF or Ground Control directions. Pilots will keep their engines running
         unless fuel becomes critical. If the weather becomes a greater threat, the pilot will
         coordinate with the SOF for egress or taxi.
  4.10.6. T-6 Flying Status Criteria Runway 13
     4.10.6.1. Unrestricted. Weather conditions allow full use of the MOA and Honcho’s
     pattern. Crosswinds are within solo limits. Solo students can maintain visual reference
     with the ground during departure, area work, and recovery. Honcho controls the T-6
     pattern.
         4.10.6.1.1. A ceiling of 5100’ MSL is required for High Key operations.
     4.10.6.2. Restricted Solo. Weather is equal to or better than 3100’ MSL/5. Crosswinds
     are within solo limits and Honcho controls the T-6 pattern. This status must be followed
     by a suffix indicating the specific restriction(s) to solos. Example suffixes (not all-
     inclusive) are:
         4.10.6.2.1. Formation Only. Formations maintain VMC during departure, area work,
         and recovery, but need not maintain visual reference with the ground throughout the
         sortie.
         4.10.6.2.2. Pattern Only. Solos are restricted to Honcho’s pattern or, if Wizard is
         Solo in the Pattern, solo students may use both patterns.
         4.10.6.2.3. Low Areas Only/Inner Ring Only. Solos are limited to the specified areas
         and can maintain visual reference with the ground during departure, area work, and
         recovery.
     4.10.6.3. Dual. Weather is equal to or better than 3100’ MSL/3. No solo student sorties
     are allowed. Tower may retain the runways for controller proficiency training on the
     ELP.
         4.10.6.3.1. A ceiling 500’ above high key, remaining between 3600’ - 4600’ MSL, is
         required for High Key operations.
         4.10.6.3.2. A ceiling of 3600’ MSL is required for night operations on the RIO.
     4.10.6.4. Restricted Patterns: Weather is equal to or better than 2600’ MSL/3. No solo
     student sorties allowed. Pattern entry is via initial takeoff, straight-in from RADAR
     entry, or closed/crosswind from the center runway. No breakout capability exists. Only
     8 aircraft are allowed in the pattern.
LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010                                                             49


     4.10.6.5. Simultaneous Instruments. Instrument approaches are conducted to the center
     and the inside runway simultaneously. The SOF will announce the T-6 and T-38 statuses
     in one of the following combinations:
        4.10.6.5.1. Simultaneous Instruments. Weather is equal to or better than 2100’
        MSL/3. T-6s will recover to Laughlin via the GPS-B. T-38s will recover via ILS,
        LOC, or visual approach to the center runway. RAPCON approval is required for T-
        6s to utilize the center runway for approaches. MARSA applies to 47 FTW aircraft
        recovering simultaneously via the GPS-B and approach to RWY 13C.
        4.10.6.5.2. Multiple RADAR patterns are allowed with RAPCON approval and may
        only be conducted on approaches to the center runway. RAPCON will coordinate
        with tower to control RADAR/traffic pattern separation.
     4.10.6.6. Alternating Instruments. Weather is equal to or better than suitable approach
     minimums. All aircraft will return for an instrument approach. Multiple RADAR
     patterns are allowed during like-aircraft window with RAPCON approval. RAPCON
     will coordinate with Tower to control RADAR/traffic pattern separation. See paragraph
     4.11 for specific details.
     4.10.6.7. Stop Launch. All local launches are stopped and duty desks will stop stepping
     crews. The reason, expected duration, and instructions for airborne aircraft may be
     included. Out & back and cross country sorties may be launched with SOF approval after
     coordination with the Tower and watch supervisors.
     4.10.6.8. Weather Recall. The SOF has the option to full stop all aircraft or to recall
     aircraft to the VFR/RADAR pattern. The weather recall and change in flying status and
     the nearest suitable alternate will be announced on GUARD. Airborne aircraft will
     immediately discontinue their profiles and await sequencing for recovery. While
     awaiting sequencing, aircraft will climb to the top of their assigned altitude block and
     hold at maximum endurance airspeed. Solos will receive first priority followed by
     aircraft close to divert fuel. Fly the recovery at 250 KIAS. Once all aircraft have landed,
     the status reverts to Standby. If recalled to the pattern, status reverts to the appropriate
     status with a ―pattern only‖ suffix once all aircraft are established in the pattern.
     RAPCON will direct one aircraft in the MOA announce the weather recall on GUARD to
     ensure all local aircraft receive the recall.
     4.10.6.9. 47 OG Recall. All aircraft recover via weather recall procedures except fly
     normal airspeeds and refrain from contacting the SOF unless special handling is required.
     4.10.6.10. Standby. Awaiting improving conditions. All local aircraft have recovered.
     Weather ships, out & backs, and cross-country sorties may be launched, if appropriate,
     with SOF approval.
     4.10.6.11. Terminated. All local flying (including off-station returns) is complete
     through the scheduled start time of launches for the next day.
     4.10.6.12. Wizard Status. With the exception of the runway direction, Wizard’s status is
     independent of Honcho’s and may be one of the following: Closed, Restricted Patterns,
     Dual, Solo in the Pattern, or AHC Sterile. Weather criteria are the same as for Honcho’s
     pattern except Solo in the Pattern at Wizard requires a minimum of 3100’ MSL/5 for
50                                               LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


     RWY 13 and must allow VFR en-route to Wizard and on the RIO Arrival while
     maintaining visual reference with the ground. The SOF will determine via PIREPs if the
     weather en-route to Wizard is suitable for a status of Solo in the Pattern. Some
     coordination with RAPCON may be required to get the solos home VFR. High Key
     operations require a ceiling 500’ above high key, remaining between 3500’ – 4500’ MSL,
     and a reported flight and ground visibility of at least 3 SM.
     4.10.6.13. AHC Sterile. Wizard is closed to T-6 operations other than AHC sorties.
     Maximum of two AHC participants are allowed at Wizard during the AHC sterile period.
  4.10.7. T-6 Flying Status Criteria Runway 31
     4.10.7.1. Unrestricted. Same as Runway 13.
     4.10.7.2. Restricted Solo. Same as Runway 13.
     4.10.7.3. Restricted Patterns. Same as Runway 13.
     4.10.7.4. Simultaneous Instruments. Instrument approaches are conducted to the center
     and the inside runways simultaneously. The SOF will announce the T-6 and T-38
     statuses as:
         4.10.7.4.1. Simultaneous Instruments. Weather is equal to or better than 2100’
         MSL/3. T-6s will recover to Laughlin via the GPS-B approach. T-38s will recover
         via ILS, LOC, or visual approach to the center runway. RAPCON approval is
         required for T-6s to utilize the center runway for approaches. MARSA applies to 47
         FTW aircraft recovering simultaneously via the GPS-B and approach to RWY 31C.
     4.10.7.5. Alternating Instruments. Same as Runway 13.

     4.10.7.10. Terminated: Same as 13
     4.10.7.11. Wizard Status: Same as 13 except Solo in the pattern at Wizard requires a
     minimum of 5500’ MSL/5 for RWY 31. This allows VFR en-route to Wizard (via the
     Highway VFR Procedure) and on the RIO-XXX Arrival back to Honcho’s pattern. The
     SOF will determine via PIREPs if the weather en-route to Wizard is suitable for a status
     of Solo in the Pattern. Some coordination with RAPCON may be required to get the
     solos home VFR.
  4.10.8. T38 Flying Status Criteria Runway 13
     4.10.8.1. Weather solo: With Sup and SOF approval, T38 local solo and solo out & back
     missions may be launched on a case by case basis during any status under the conditions
     specified for weather solo in AFI 11-2T-AT-38 Volume 3, T-38 and AT-38 Operations
     Procedures.
LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010                                                           51


     4.10.8.2. Unrestricted: Weather conditions allow full use of all training areas.
     Crosswinds are within solo limits. Solo students can maintain visual reference with the
     ground during departure, area work, and recovery. Lariat controls the T-38 pattern.
     4.10.8.3. Restricted Solo (SUPT only): Weather is equal to or better than 3600’ MSL/5.
     Crosswinds are within solo limits. This status must be followed by a suffix indicating the
     specific restriction(s) to solos. Example suffixes (not all-inclusive) are:
         4.10.8.3.1. Inner Ring/Specific Areas Only: Solos are limited to the specified areas
         and can maintain visual reference with the ground during departure, area work, and
         recovery. Inner ring is defined as Ranch Areas 1-4.

     in from the ZADOM arrival, or, if once established on the ZADOM and the weather
     permits VFR cloud clearances to the pattern entry point, pilots may cancel IFR and enter
     via straight-in from West Fork (Rwy 13) or Fort Clark (Rwy 31). Entry may also be
     made from initial takeoff or closed/crosswind from the center runway. Tower will
     normally control the outside runway during Restricted Patterns status or lower. No
     breakout capability exists.
     4.10.8.6. Straight-In Only: Weather is equal to or better than 2600’MSL/3. No overhead
     patterns are allowed. Low closed patterns are allowed. Crosswind and outside
     downwind will be flown at 2100’MSL. Only 6 aircraft are allowed in the pattern. Entry
     is limited to crosswind from initial takeoff or the center runway. No breakout capability
     exists.

4.11. Instrument Status Procedures
   4.11.1. When the weather precludes aircraft from having a traffic pattern (i.e., less than
   1500’ AGL/3), the SOF will coordinate with the Squadron Sups for an Instruments status.
   4.11.2. T-6s and T38s will alternate Instrument periods or be Simultaneous Instruments
   (GPS-B and center recoveries on Runway 13, GPS-B on RWY 31). The Alternating
   Instrument periods are normally 2 hours in duration, but Sups should coordinate with each
   other for shorter/longer periods based on sortie capability.
   4.11.3. During ―Instrument Status,‖ single-ship T-6 aircraft shall depart on the following
   IFR clearance: Aircrews are automatically cleared to the DLF133/013 fix via the QWAIL
   ROUTE. Climb and maintain 13,000. Expect further clearance at 13 DME.
   4.11.4. Alternating Instruments.            Local mission T-6/T38 aircraft will land during their
   respective instrument period.
      4.11.4.1. T-6s and T38s may fly multiple approaches during their respective Instrument
      window with RAPCON approval. RAPCON and Tower shall coordinate multiple
      approaches.
      4.11.4.2. T1s will smooth-flow launches and arrivals throughout the instrument periods,
      but will not fly multiple approaches or RADAR delays (except in unusual circumstances,
      with SOF/RAPCON approval). T1s should use the training areas of the non-flying
      aircraft (i.e., during T38 Instruments, use Burr Areas).
   4.11.5. Weather Ships:
 54                                               LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


      4.11.5.1. A weather ship is an aircraft that departs Laughlin Class C airspace to
      determine weather conditions and if operations can be conducted in the MOA.
      4.11.5.2. A maximum of two aircraft will be called a weather ship. Only two weather
      ships will be airborne at one time.
   4.11.6. T-6/T38 out & back/cross country aircraft may takeoff as scheduled, or coordinate a
   later estimated departure time with the Sups from both squadrons. All off-station T-6/T38
   aircrews returning to Laughlin will coordinate with their Sup to land during their respective
   aircraft’s Instrument period (unless designated as a weather-ship).
   4.11.7. Alternate fuels. When an ―Alternate‖ is directed, all aircrews will plan to land with
   enough fuel to divert to the designated alternate.
      4.11.7.1. Alternate fuels for weather phenomena. If the SOF directs that aircraft carry
      alternate fuels for predictable weather phenomena, the SOF may elect to allow aircraft to
      burn down below alternate fuels in the pattern. This will allow local aircraft to be
      positioned to land in an expeditious manner but still continue to train. In the case of
      winds potentially gusting out of limits or forecast to be out of limits, aircraft will land at
      or above alternate fuels.
   4.11.8. Divert Fuels depicted in the In-flight Guides are based on departing Laughlin from
   the missed approach point, climbing to the depicted altitude, cruising (no wind), descending,
   and landing at the divert base with AFI 11202 Vol 3 fuel reserves. Aircrews must adjust
   recovery fuel to compensate for winds and traffic density to ensure adequate fuel reserves are
   available.
4.12. Pattern Check Procedures
   4.12.1. Pattern checks will be requested by/with the control facility (Tower/RSU). A pattern
   check is accomplished by sending an aircraft into the respective pattern to determine cloud
   heights and if pattern operations can continue.
   4.12.2. Aircraft will not climb above 3100’ (except T-6s on initial to check ELP weather up
   to 4100’ MSL) and will make every effort to maintain pattern ground track. Checks outside
   the pattern and any made during an instrument status must be coordinated through the Tower,
   and RAPCON.
   4.12.3. Aircrews inadvertently entering IMC conditions will maintain current altitude and
   heading, squawk emergency, and contact RAPCON. When the observation is reported below
   1000’/3, pattern checks are not authorized.
LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010                                                              55


                                           Chapter 5

                                ABNORMAL PROCEDURES

5.1. Miscellaneous
   5.1.1. RSU/Tower Visual Check Procedures. If a visual check is necessary, fly no lower
   than 100’ AGL down the runway or as directed by the controller.
   5.1.2. Hot Brake Area and Procedures. In the event of suspected hot brakes, the pilot will
   notify the Tower or RSU. Tower will activate the primary crash net. If possible, proceed to
   a depicted hot brake area on the airfield diagram. (Attachment 5) Aircrew must make every
   effort to park the aircraft nosewheel in the center of the taxiway yellow 1 ft. x 3 ft. painted
   block with the aircraft pointed into the wind. Each block corresponds to the hot brake areas
   depicted in the inflight guide.
      5.1.2.1. Runway 31 Operations. There are two aircraft hot brake areas depicted at the
      airfield northern end. The primary hot brake area is the farthest west position of the two
      depicted in Attachment 5, Airfield diagram, located on taxiway A, west of runway
      31L. The secondary hot brake area is the eastern position located on taxiway A between
      runways 31C and 31L. Aircrew should attempt to use the primary hot brake area if
      conditions permit.
          5.1.2.1.1. Once stopped at the respective hot brake area, expect Fire Emergency
          Services Flight personnel to perform an evaluation of aircraft condition. Unless an
          immediate hazard exists, FD personnel will withdraw to a nearby area with one
          reaction vehicle for the next 30 minutes. At the expiration of the mandatory 30
          minute monitoring period and with no cause to remain, FD OSC will terminate the
          emergency.
          5.1.2.1.2. During the 30 minute monitoring period, with an aircraft at the primary hot
          brake area, taxi operations are authorized to continue only on the south taxi line from
          runway 31L to taxiway G. For hot brake aircraft stopped at the secondary spot,
          taxiway A west is closed from 31C to 31L for the duration of the initial reaction and
          30 minute monitoring periods.
          5.1.2.1.3. For hot brake aircraft parked at the secondary site, there are two main
          aerodrome operational impacts. First, runway 31R aircraft clearing at taxiway A
          must request back taxi on runway 31C to clear at any taxiway other than A. T-38s are
          reminded of the restriction allowing no more than one T-38 to be parked on taxiway
          B or C. Second, aircraft landing runway 31C are encouraged to perform landings
          which safely allow early turnoff at any appropriate taxiway other than taxiway A,
          otherwise these aircraft will be required to back taxi to clear runway 31C.
          5.1.2.1.4. Runway 13 Operations. Due to the different taxiway locations of both
          south aerodrome hot brake areas, they will continue to be referred to by all personnel
          as the ―Taxiway E‖ and ―Taxiway G‖ hot brake area(s). In these locations, aircrew
          must taxi their aircraft nosewheel onto the center of the 1 ft. x 3 ft. yellow hot brake
          painted block with the aircraft pointed into the wind. FD reaction protocol including
          the mandatory 30 minute monitoring period is the same as runway 31 operations.
 56                                                LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


          5.1.2.1.5. With a hot brake aircraft at the taxiway G hot brake area, all runway
          13C/13L aircraft must clear the respective runway at a taxiway other than G or H as
          appropriate. For hot brake aircraft on the taxiway E spot, runway 13R landing
          aircraft must clear that runway at a taxiway other than taxiway E.
   5.1.3. Airborne Transponder Failure.         RAPCON will assign T38/T-1 aircraft with
   transponder failure to Ranch 14, if available, using primary RADAR (solos will be given
   priority). If Ranch 1-4 is not available, aircrews will RTB. This service is provided at the
   discretion of the RAPCON watch supervisor.
   5.1.4. External Stores Drop Area
      5.1.4.1. Under VFR conditions, pilots will be instructed to make an approach to the
      active runway at 1600’ and, when approaching the field, to fly a ground track directly
      over the intersection of the closed runways. They will be instructed to release external
      stores over the intersection of the closed runways. Under IFR conditions, pilots will be
      instructed to fly an approach to the active runway. When breaking out of the weather, the
      pilot will be instructed to climb or descend to 1600’ (or the highest usable VMC altitude
      below 1600’), then follow the VFR procedures listed above.
   5.1.5. Fuel Dumping
      5.1.5.1. Ground fuel dumping is not permitted at Laughlin.
      5.1.5.2. Aerial Fuel Dumping will be conducted IAW FAAO 7110.65.
   5.1.6. Bailout Procedures. Pilots initiating a controlled bailout will maintain assigned
   altitude or a minimum of 3100’ MSL and proceed direct to the Laughlin VORTAC. Pilots
   will depart the VORTAC heading 043. The controlled bailout point is DLF 043/4 heading
   043.
   5.1.7. Early Returns. The term ―Early Return‖ is often used by aircrew as an advisory that
   an aircraft is returning to base significantly earlier than planned. This occurs for a variety of
   reasons (e.g. airsick student, minor aircraft malfunction). Aircrews on an "Early Return" will
   advise the SOF. Additionally, an "Early Return" aircraft should advise ATC of any special
   handling/information required to facilitate the recovery. Early Return aircraft will not be
   afforded traffic priority solely as a result of this status. Pilots wishing to receive traffic
   priority should consider declaring an emergency.
   5.1.8. DLF Radar Limitations. Laughlin's Digital Airport Surveillance Radar (DASR)
   provides primary radar coverage to 60 NM and secondary radar coverage to 120 NM.
   Aircraft operating outside 60 NM and/or within Ranch airspaces 5 through 11 will only be
   provided secondary radar services, therefore traffic advisories will only be available on
   transponder equipped aircraft (e.g., civilian aircraft that aren't transponder equipped will not
   be visible on ATC radar).
5.2. Airfield Equipment Contingencies
   5.2.1. RSU Com-Out Procedures
      5.2.1.1. In the event of RSU electrical/radio failure the RSU controller will use light gun
      signals to direct aircraft on final to go around. The aircraft sent around will transmit
      ―The RSU has lost power contact tower.‖ The controller will contact tower via hotline,
LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010                                                            57


     landline telephone, or cell-phone as soon as possible to complete a verbal handoff of the
     runway. Tower will make an announcement on Guard as they assume control of the
     affected runway. All aircraft will switch to Tower (channel 5) for instructions. The
     normal RSU pattern ground track will be flown. Aircraft in the pattern have the option to
     depart, full-stop, or fly straight-through on initial. No touch-and-go landings will be
     flown and launches into the patterns will be terminated. Tower may be required to
     suspend pattern entries from the RADAR entry point. Aircrews denied entry at the
     RADAR entry point should expect vectors for a straight-in to the center runway.
     5.2.1.2. Extended Services. For extended periods of RSU equipment outage, the 47
     OG/CC may authorize limited pattern operations under Tower control provided a Class B
     RSU is in place. Reference AETCI 11-204 for solo student restrictions.
     5.2.1.3. If a Wizard RSU radio failure is noted through light gun signals by any T-6
     aircrew, advise the SOF and any other aircraft in the pattern. Fly straight through initial
     and depart.
  5.2.2. Non-RADAR Operations
     5.2.2.1. RAPCON’s loss of RADAR is a major limiting factor in the ability to provide
     expeditious air traffic control service. Any deviations from the procedures outlined
     below, or in the IFGs, require SOF and RAPCON Watch Supervisor coordination. Due
     to TERPs criteria, certain routes are not usable when RAPCON’s RADAR is not
     operational. In this case, aircrews can expect alternate departure instructions.
     5.2.2.2. Use of Rocksprings Long-Range RADAR Feed.
        5.2.2.2.1. In the event that the Laughlin RADAR fails the RAPCON will use the
        Rocksprings Long-Range RADAR Feed. The RAPCON Watch Supervisor may
        request to stop departures until RADAR coverage has been established from the
        Rocksprings Long-Range RADAR Feed. Operations may be resumed after the
        RAPCON Watch Supervisor advises the Tower Watch Supervisor.
        5.2.2.2.2. Aircrews should expect delays when using the Rocksprings Long-Range
        RADAR Feed due to the requirement to increase standard RADAR separation for
        both departures and arrivals.
        5.2.2.2.3. If the RAPCON is unable to establish RADAR coverage from the
        Rocksprings Long-Range RADAR Feed, the non-RADAR procedures in this section
        will be followed.
     5.2.2.3. Initial Transition from RADAR to Non-RADAR. The following actions will
     occur regardless of weather conditions:
        5.2.2.3.1. RAPCON will instruct Tower to stop all departures. Tower will notify the
        SOF.
        5.2.2.3.2. The SOF will ensure both RSUs stop all departures, excluding aircraft
        planning to remain in the RSU pattern.
        5.2.2.3.3. RAPCON will broadcast the RADAR outage on all frequencies. All IFR
        flight plans for aircraft departing for, or arriving from, the MOAs will automatically
        be canceled. Aircraft will maintain VFR and follow the applicable procedures in
58                                             LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


        paragraph 5.2.2.    If unable to accept cancellation of IFR, immediately advise
        RAPCON.
        5.2.2.3.4. All MOA operations will immediately transition to the RADAR-out
        boundaries and altitudes as described/depicted in the IFGs.
        5.2.2.3.5. RAPCON will direct all T-38s/T-1s en route to the Ranch areas to descend
        to 17,500’ and maintain VFR. Advise controller if unable to maintain VFR.
        5.2.2.3.6. Airborne departures en route to destinations outside Laughlin’s airspace
        will continue on their IFR departure route.
        5.2.2.3.7. All arriving aircraft will proceed to the appropriate pattern entry point if
        weather conditions and flying status permit. If unable to maintain VFR comply with
        controller instructions.
        5.2.2.3.8. RAPCON will notify AMOPS of RADAR failure. AMOPS will issue
        appropriate NOTAMs.
     5.2.2.4. After RAPCON and all airborne aircraft transition from RADAR to non-
     RADAR environment, departures may resume (after SOF/ATC coordination) according
     to the non-RADAR procedures contained in this instruction and depicted in the IFGs.
        5.2.2.4.1. If a status of restricted patterns for T-6s or dual or better for T38s/T1s
        cannot be maintained, then flying may resume under a limited instrument operation
        where only one type aircraft will be flown, and all operations immediately revert to
        IMC non-RADAR operations. Weather ships are not authorized during this limited
        instrument operation unless that aircraft type is operating.
     5.2.2.5. VMC Non-RADAR Operations
        5.2.2.5.1. VFR Procedures to the MOAs and Wizard
           5.2.2.5.1.1. Radio procedures remain the same, except Clearance Delivery will
           not ―CLEAR‖ aircraft for coded departure procedures. Clearance Delivery will
           precede coded departure clearances with the phraseology ―PROCEED WITH‖
           (i.e., ―BULLY 44 PROCEED WITH THE LAUGHLIN ONE DEPARTURE,
           TAELR ROUTE‖).
           5.2.2.5.1.2. T38s will fly only the TAELR or LAEKE ROUTE at 17,500’.
           5.2.2.5.1.3. T-6s will fly the QWAIL ROUTE at 13500’ and GRANDE
           procedure at 12,500’.
           5.2.2.5.1.4. Runway 13: WIZARD-VFR departure will be flown at 2100’.
           5.2.2.5.1.5. Runway 31: WIZARD-VFR Transition will be flown at 5500’.
           5.2.2.5.1.6. T1s will fly the TAELR or LAEKE ROUTE at 17,500’
        5.2.2.5.2. Departure Procedures for Aircraft Going Into Houston Center Airspace on
        an IFR Flight Plan
           5.2.2.5.2.1. T-6s will file a normal flight plan. Clearance Delivery will issue
           detailed departure instructions unless the pilot has filed for one of the Departure
           Procedures.
LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010                                                            59


            5.2.2.5.2.2. T38s/T1s will file a normal flight plan requesting a SID.
        5.2.2.5.3. VFR Arrival Procedures
            5.2.2.5.3.1. T-6 aircraft fly the Rio One Procedure at 6500’ or 14,500’.
            5.2.2.5.3.2. T38/T1 aircraft may fly the BRIDGE or DEVILS Recoveries and
            proceed direct West Fork/Fort Clark once below 8500’. WEBOX and PRIER
            Recoveries proceed direct West Fork/Fort Clark once below 6500’. ZADOM
            Recovery fly depicted ground track to West Fork/Fort Clark.
            5.2.2.5.3.3. Requests for IFR approaches require SOF/RAPCON approval and
            will be allowed only on a traffic-permitting basis. When T38s are in control of
            the outside runway RSU pattern, T-1’s will recover to the center runway. Aircraft
            can expect one approach to a full-stop.
     5.2.2.6. IMC Non-RADAR Operations
        5.2.2.6.1. IFR Departure procedures
            5.2.2.6.1.1. The only IFR published departure routes authorized under IFR non-
            RADAR conditions are the LAUGHLIN ONE and HINKO ONE Departures for
            both Runway 13 and 31. All other published departure routes require operational
            RADAR and are not authorized for IFR when the RADAR is out of service.
            5.2.2.6.1.2. T38s/T1s/T-6s will file a normal flight plan requesting a SID.
            Clearance Delivery will issue detailed departure instructions.
        5.2.2.6.2. IFR Arrival Procedures. All aircraft will recover through published arrival
        points for an instrument approach to the center runway and full-stop.
  5.2.3. Laughlin VORTAC-Out Procedures. These procedures will be in effect when any part
  of the Laughlin VORTAC is out of service for extended periods. Procedures affecting
  locally-assigned aircraft only apply when the TACAN/DME portion is out of service.
     5.2.3.1. RAPCON shall notify AMOPS and Houston Center if any part of the VORTAC
     fails. AMOPS shall issue the appropriate NOTAM and notify Del Rio International
     Airport.
     5.2.3.2. Regardless of status, all aircraft filed to Laughlin require an alternate, IAW AFI
     11-202, Vol. 3. Aircraft may burn down fuel in the local VFR pattern unless the SOF
     dictates otherwise.
     5.2.3.3. MARSA Procedures in para. 4.2. shall still apply to locally-assigned aircraft
     conducting simultaneous same direction operations, weather and ATC workload
     permitting. Aircrews shall use GPS/DME to determine when passing the MARSA
     termination point.
     5.2.3.4. Locally-assigned aircraft may use GPS to fly an arc if instructed by ATC
     permitting that the instruction is not part of a local route. Example: ―Intercept the
     Laughlin 15 DME ARC; ARC north‖ is okay vs. ―cleared via the FORDE ROUTE‖.
     Aircraft may not fly the HI-ILS approach since that arc is based off of the VORTAC.
     5.2.3.5. Tower shall call the final approach fix for aircraft conducting an ILS approach.
 60                                              LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


       5.2.3.6. Stereo routes may not be used. A DD Form 175 must be filed for all sorties
       departing the local area.
       5.2.3.7. Local Area and MOA Operations
           5.2.3.7.1. T-1 & T-38 Procedures
              5.2.3.7.1.1. Depart runway heading and expect RADAR vectors to the assigned
              MOA or filed departure fix (LAEKE, TAELR, HJORN). Utilize normal MOA
              boundaries as defined by GPS. Local departure crossing restrictions still apply.
              Example: ―Cleared to Laughlin AFB via runway heading, then RADAR vectors.
              Expect TAELR ROUTE.‖
              5.2.3.7.1.2. If able to maintain VFR, recovery may be made via Fort Clark or
              West Fork (Tower must control the outside runway for T-1’s). Recovery to the
              center runway shall be made via RADAR vectors to visual alignment or an
              instrument approach.
              5.2.3.7.1.3. If unable to maintain VFR, recover via RADAR vectors to an
              instrument approach.
           5.2.3.7.2. T-6 Procedures
              5.2.3.7.2.1. Non-Instrument Status: T-6s will depart VFR via the QWAIL,
              WIZARD, or HIGHWAY ground-track. For the QWAIL ROUTE, expect an IFR
              pickup and RADAR vectors after passing the MARSA termination point. For the
              HIGHWAY procedure expect an IFR pickup and RADAR vectors after initial
              contact. The PIIPE ROUTE may be flown using visual reference and/or GPS to
              navigate from QWAIL to PIIPE fix. ATC may instruct aircraft to fly the 15 DME
              ARC in lieu of the FORDE ROUTE. Utilize normal MOA boundaries as defined
              by GPS. Example: ―Maintain VFR, expect RADAR vectors, then QWAIL
              ROUTE.‖
              5.2.3.7.2.2. Instrument Status: Depart runway heading and expect RADAR
              vectors to the assigned MOA or QWAIL fix. The PIIPE ROUTE may be flown
              using GPS to navigate from QWAIL to PIIPE fix. ATC may instruct aircraft to
              fly the 15 DME ARC in lieu of the FORDE ROUTE. Utilize normal MOA
              boundaries as defined by GPS. Example: ―Cleared to Laughlin AFB via runway
              heading, then RADAR vectors. Expect QWAIL ROUTE.‖
              5.2.3.7.2.3. Wizard Procedures: Ceiling at Wizard must be at least 2000’ AGL
              (3000’ MSL). Departures to and from Wizard will be via RADAR vectors if on
              an IFR clearance. When departing to SKI areas from Wizard on RWY 13, depart
              on heading 175o. For RWY 31, proceed on a downwind departure to heading
              130o. Maintain 130o until clear of the 90o to initial track. Expect RADAR
              vectors. All Wizard departures shall maintain VFR at or below 4500’ MSL until
              they have received other ATC instructions.
NOTE: Aircrews instructed to fly the 35 DME ARC in lieu of the NORTH or SOUTH Routes
are still required to maintain VMC and ―see-and-avoid‖ other aircraft operating in adjacent SKI
areas. Aircrews shall inform ATC immediately if they are unable to maintain VMC so that other
RADAR separation can be applied.
LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010                                                          61


            5.2.3.7.2.4. Recovery: If Laughlin is VFR, recovery will be via the Rio One
            Procedure. Aircraft will fly direct OTULE, remaining east of the Rio Grande, and
            then proceed inbound on the Rio ground track. If unable to maintain VFR, remain
            with RAPCON and request vectors to an instrument approach or GPS-Bravo if
            conditions permit.
     5.2.3.8. Off-station Operations
        5.2.3.8.1. T-1, T-38, & T-6 Procedures
            5.2.3.8.1.1. Depart runway heading and expect RADAR vectors to the filed
            departure fix (LAEKE, TAELR, HINKO). Local departure crossing restrictions
            still apply. Example: ―Cleared to Laughlin AFB via runway heading, then
            RADAR vectors. Expect TAELR ROUTE.‖
            5.2.3.8.1.2. Expect recovery (from Houston Center) via clearance to LAEKE,
            TAELR, WEBOX, or PRIER as defined by GPS, followed by direct Laughlin for
            RADAR vectors.
            5.2.3.8.1.3. If able to maintain VFR, T-38 and T-1 recoveries may be made via
            Fort Clark or West Fork (Tower must control the outside runway for T-1’s).
            Recovery to the center runway shall be made via RADAR vectors to visual
            alignment or an instrument approach. T-6’s may request visual entry or RADAR
            vectors for the Rio One Procedure.
            5.2.3.8.1.4. If unable to maintain VFR, recover via RADAR vectors to an
            instrument approach. T-6’s may request RADAR vectors for the GPS-Bravo if
            conditions permit.
     5.2.3.9. RADAR failure during VORTAC-Out Procedures. If the RADAR fails while
     VORTAC-out procedures are in effect all departures will stop until RADAR coverage
     has been established from the Rocksprings Long-Range RADAR Feed. Operations may
     be resumed after the RAPCON watch supervisor advises the Tower Watch Supervisor. If
     RAPCON is unable to establish RADAR from the long-range RADAR feed, airborne
     aircraft will maintain VFR and land at Laughlin if able. If unable to maintain VFR,
     airborne aircraft will divert to the designated alternate IAW normal procedures and land.
     5.2.3.10. Lost Communications and VORTAC-Out Procedures
        5.2.3.10.1. T-1 & T-6 Procedures
            5.2.3.10.1.1. If able to maintain VFR: Aircraft will squawk 7600 and descend
            within the assigned area VFR to an appropriate VFR altitude. T-1’s will then
            proceed direct to Laughlin and accomplish a straight-in approach to the active
            center runway and land. T-6’s will fly direct OTULE, remaining east of the Rio
            Grande, and then proceed inbound via the RIO ground track to the active inside
            runway and land.
            5.2.3.10.1.2. If unable to maintain VFR: Squawk 7600. If capable, fly the GPS
            approach to the active center runway and land. If already established on an
            approach, continue the approach and land. If unable to land, divert. For missed
            approach, execute missed approach procedures. Upon reaching 5000’ divert to
            the designated alternate IAW normal procedures and land. Aircrews unable to
62                                            LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


            meet the above conditions will divert to the designated alternate and land.
            Comply with the IFG and/or the FIH as appropriate. Use extreme caution when
            transiting through or near local practice areas.
         5.2.3.10.2. T-38 Procedures
            5.2.3.10.2.1. If able to maintain VFR: Squawk 7600 and descend within the
            assigned area VFR to an appropriate VFR altitude below 9,000’and comply with
            the IFG Basic VMC Radio-out Procedure (BVRP). Proceed to West Fork/Fort
            Clark as appropriate and land.
            5.2.3.10.2.2. If unable to maintain VFR: Squawk 7600. If already established on
            an approach, continue the approach and land. If unable to land, divert. For
            missed approach, execute missed approach procedures. Upon reaching 5000’
            divert to the designated alternate IAW normal procedures and land. Aircrews
            unable to meet the above conditions will divert to the designated alternate and
            land. Comply with the IFG and/or the FIH as appropriate. Use extreme caution
            when transiting through or near local practice areas.
  5.2.4. Airfield Lighting Malfunctions
     5.2.4.1. Tower will notify the SOF, RAPCON and AMOPS of any lighting malfunction.
     The SOF will notify the 47OG/CC in the event the outage causes the system to be
     unusable. The 47 OG/CC will decide whether work on the lights will begin immediately
     or be delayed until aircraft have been recovered or diverted. The SOF will coordinate
     with AMOPS on system repairs. If applicable, AMOPS will publish a NOTAM for the
     lighting system outage.
     5.2.4.2. 47 CES will operate the airfield lighting when the Control Tower is closed,
     evacuated, or equipment malfunction prohibits the Tower from operating the lights. If
     the automatic changeover capability for runway lighting emergency power is not
     available, 47 CES will ensure Electrical Systems Flight personnel are located in the
     lighting vault from sunset until local night flying is completed.
     5.2.4.3. Runway Light Failure. In the event of partial runway lighting failure, AMOPS
     will review AFI 13-213 and send appropriate NOTAMS as necessary. If the lighting is
     not useable per AFI 13-213 the system must be turned off (MAJCOM/DO waiver
     authority). Upon being told of partial runway light failure, the 47 OG/CC will determine
     if continued flying operations are warranted. If the 47 OG/CC determines that the
     affected runway is useable, AM notifies the 47 CES Operations Flight to delay work until
     further advised.
  5.2.5. Back-Up Generator Operation
     5.2.5.1. The 47 OG/CC has determined commercial or base power to be reliable. The
     AOF Complex has reliable auto-start capability for backup generators and an
     uninterruptible power source (UPS).
     5.2.5.2. Actual or anticipated power outages necessitating the use of backup generators:
     When the RAPCON is open the RAPCON WS is responsible for generator operations for
     Bldg 308/309. The RSU monitor will be responsible for initiating generator start-up and
LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010                                                                   63


       operating procedures. Annual training on generator procedures will be conducted for
       ATC personnel and RSU monitors by the 47 CES Operations Flight.
5.3. Sightings of Suspicious Aircraft or Activity. When requested by law enforcement
officials (Western Air Defense Sector, DEA, FBI, ICE), dual aircrews will, time permitting,
relay sightings of suspicious aircraft or activity to RAPCON/Tower. Dual aircrews may be
asked by the SOF to determine if an aircraft has landed in the general area. Comply with this
request provided it does not interfere with the training mission, and does not require deviation
from the assigned area, departure, or arrival.
5.4. Quiet/Sterile Periods. Various events on base, during operating hours, may require a
reduction of noise on the base. This section addresses the three most common events. Unusual
circumstances must be handled as appropriate. The SOF may customize the procedures to cater
to the specific circumstance. Make requests through Wing Programming (47 OSS/OSOS).
Quiet/Sterile Periods will be posted on the weekly flying schedule. AMOPS will issue a local
NOTAM and post a message on the Airfield Status Page advising aircraft about quiet hours one
day prior to the quiet period. A Retreat Flyby is considered a special case and need not utilize
the procedures in paragraphs 5.4.2. and 5.4.3.
   5.4.1. Flyby Procedures. Approximately every third Thursday, in conjunction with
   graduation, the wing sponsors a flyby over the 1700 retreat ceremony. The intent is for the
   area around Laughlin to be cleared for the flyby. Following the flyby, the area around the
   ceremony should remain quiet until the end of the ceremony. The sterilization of the air
   traffic is only required for the flyby. If the flyby is cancelled for weather, the sterile period is
   not required, but quiet hours may still be in effect. The following procedures apply during
   graduation retreat flybys:
       5.4.1.1. Retreat Flyby will be conducted on 284.9 (unless otherwise necessary and
       coordinated with SOF). RAPCON will remain in contact with flyby aircraft on 284.9
       until a frequency change is requested.
       5.4.1.2. There will be no departures from any runway from 1650 until the ceremony is
       over.
       5.4.1.3. All aircraft must either be on the ground or proceeding outside 15 DME NLT
       1650, and will remain outside 15 DME until 1705. Aircraft proceeding outside 15 DME
       will be established and remain outside 15 DME by 1655.
           5.4.1.4. Figure 5.1 outlines the procedures and restrictions that will be followed for
           Retreat Flyby Procedures.
       5.4.1.5. From 1630 until 1705, to ensure separation from flyby aircraft holding in SKI
       Area 5, all aircraft within 15 DME (and not established in a RSU pattern) will remain in
       radio contact with RAPCON/Tower
       5.4.1.6. To control noise levels reaching the retreat ceremony, the following restrictions
       will be in effect from 1705 until the End of Ceremony (EOC) at approximately 1715 or
       when cleared by the 47 OG/CC or CD:
           5.4.1.6.1. No overhead patterns will be flown to any runway. Only straight-ins to a
           full-stop will be flown to the center and outside runways.
 64                                                LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


          5.4.1.6.2. Neither pilots nor maintenance will start engines on the ramp, run engines
          on the ramp or taxi out. Arrivals will taxi clear into the hammerhead and hold until
          the quiet period is over or shutdown and coordinate for a tug. Expect a call on the
          brick to the SOF from the 47 OG/CC or CD to resume normal operations. The SOF
          will pass the ―Resume normal ops‖ call to Tower/RAPCON/RSU/Sups.
          5.4.1.6.3. Airfield Operations will publish a NOTAM for this event, referring to it as
          a ―RETREAT CEREMONY‖
   5.4.2. Sterile Periods are established when a flyby will be flown for an event. Sterile Periods
   will be from 5 minutes prior to the time-on-target (TOT) until 5 minutes after. There will be
   no locally assigned airborne aircraft within 15 DME of Laughlin other than the flyby aircraft
   during this period. If an emergency aircraft needs to land during the sterile period, the SOF
   will consider canceling or delaying the flyby.
       5.4.2.1. Sterile Periods often occur in conjunction with, but are not to be confused with
       Quiet Periods
       5.4.2.2. AMOPS will issue a NOTAM and post a message on the Airfield Status Page
       advising aircraft about Sterile Periods one day prior to the event. The NOTAM will refer
       to the event as a ―QUIET PERIOD‖ or ―QUIET/STERILE PERIOD‖ as appropriate.
   5.4.3. Quiet Periods. Quiet Period Start Time (QPST) is 5 minutes prior to the event/TOT,
   and normally lasts for 30 minutes.

Figure 5.1. Retreat Flyby Procedures


Figure 5.1. Retreat Flyby Procedures

              No departures from any runway until the End of Ceremony (EOC).
1650 - 1705   All aircraft must be on the ground or proceeding outside 15 DME (established
              outside 15 DME by 1655) and remain outside 15 DME.
              Arrivals may resume approaches to a straight-in, full stop on runways 13C/31C
              and 13L/31R only. Honcho’s pattern will remain closed until EOC. Landing
1705 – EOC
              aircraft will taxi clear into the hammerhead and hold until the quiet period is over,
              or shutdown and coordinate for a tug.
              47 OG/CC or CD will approve the resumption of normal operations, which
              include takeoffs and arrival to the inside runway, touch and goes, overhead
EOC
              patterns and taxi operations. The SOF will relay this information to Tower,
              RAPCON, and RSUs.
       5.4.3.1. To facilitate a Quiet Period, the procedures for a Sterile Period in Figure 5.2 will
       be followed with the following exceptions.
          5.4.3.1.1. If no flyby is planned, aircraft are not required to remain outside 15 DME
          before or during the Quiet Period.
          5.4.3.1.2. During the quiet period, no aircraft will be allowed to start, taxi, takeoff, or
          fly an overhead pattern. Tower will advise maintenance of the quiet period. When
LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010                                                             65


          clear of the runway, aircraft will proceed to the hammerhead of 13/31 and hold until
          the quiet period is over, or shutdown and coordinate for a tug. Towing of aircraft is
          permitted.
   5.4.4. Noise Abatement
      5.4.4.1. Flying over Del Rio below 3000’ MSL is prohibited (except T-6s flying the
      RADAR entry ground track from Rio to RWY 13R and recovery from DRT into VFR
      entry).
      5.4.4.2. Aircraft will not over fly base housing below 2100’ (1000’ AGL). EXCEPTION
      – This restriction does not apply during the closed pull-up or while accomplishing the
      circling portion of the GPS-B approach.
   5.4.5. AETC Quiet Hours Policy. AETC Quiet Hours Policy has been established between
   2200 and 0600 local time. No unsuppressed engine runs will be conducted during this
   period. Aircraft will not be allowed to takeoff, touch-and-go, or low approach during this
   period unless local night flying is scheduled, and then only during the hours of the scheduled
   night flying period. The senior maintenance representative on duty will approve engine runs.
   All other deviations require 47 FTW/CC approval.
   5.4.6. Ceremonial Periods. Ceremonial periods are established to allow for a greater
   freedom of operations while providing some degree of quiet for smaller base ceremonies,
   such as those that occur at Heritage Park.
      5.4.6.1. The following are prohibited during a ceremonial period: overhead patterns or
      closed patterns, touch and goes to any runway, multiple approaches, departures from any
      runway, and high-powered engine runs for maintenance purposes.
      5.4.6.2. The following are specifically permitted during the ceremonial period: straight-
      in approaches to any runway including runways 13R/31L via the RIO 1 recovery, taxi
      back to chocks, engine start and taxi out. T-1’s taxiing back to chocks will shut down
      ramp side engines at the discretion of the aircraft commander.
      5.4.6.3. Make all requests for ceremonial periods through 47 OSS/OSOS NLT the
      Wednesday prior to the week of the requested event. OSOS may schedule up to 15
      minutes of ceremonial period time, and place it on the weekly schedule.
5.5. Opposite Direction Operations
   5.5.1. Opposite direction traffic at Laughlin AFB is not permitted during SUPT operations
   without SOF approval, unless the situation is time critical and safety of flight related.
   5.5.2. If opposite direction traffic is approved by the SOF: No opposite direction departures
   will be approved when an arrival is within 20 NM of the active runway.
   5.5.3. No opposite direction arrivals will be permitted within 20 NM of the active runway
   when an aircraft has been cleared for takeoff or there is another arrival within 20 NM of the
   runway in use.
   5.5.4. Landings (including touch-and-go’s) are not permitted over a raised approach-end
   barrier (BAK15). Low approaches over a raised approach-end barrier are restricted to at or
   above 500’ AGL.
 66                                               LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


5.6. Helicopter Procedures
   5.6.1. Arrival (Local Flying in Progress). Helicopters filed into Laughlin AFB VFR when
   local flying is in progress are normally vectored to the DLF 173/5 and released to Tower at
   or below 1600’ MSL to stay below the local traffic patterns. Tower instructs the helicopter
   to make a straight-in approach to the Tower and to break off the approach to land at a
   designated location. Tower will notify the RSU(s) when the helicopter is 5 NM out; the RSU
   will announce applicable information to aircraft in their pattern and make pattern adjustments
   to restrict aircraft operations to at or above 2100’ MSL until notified by Tower to resume
   normal operations.
   5.6.2. Arrival (No Local Flying in Progress). Helicopters filed into Laughlin VFR when no
   local flying is in progress are normally vectored direct to Laughlin and advised to change to
   Tower frequency prior to entering the VFR Practice Area. Tower will issue landing
   instructions and provide taxi instructions to the parking ramp.
   5.6.3. Departures. Tower instructs helicopters leaving VFR to depart southbound, maintain
   at or below 1600’ MSL until 5 NM from DLF, and to contact RAPCON. Tower coordinates
   the departure route with the RSU(s) before the helicopter’s departure. Tower will contact
   RSU(s) approximately 5 minutes prior to helicopter departure and restrict RSU operations to
   at or above 2100’ MSL before clearing the helicopter for takeoff. After the helicopter
   departs Tower will notify the RSUs when it is 5 NM from the field.
   5.6.4. CH53 and larger helicopters will be treated as fixed-wing aircraft and will not be
   permitted to air taxi. Departure and Arrival of these types will be on a runway.
5.7. Air Ambulance Flights
   5.7.1. Priority aircraft (LIFEGUARD and MEDEVAC/Airlife/AirMed/AirCare on request)
   enroute to/from Laughlin AFB, Del Rio International, Val Verde Hospital helicopter pad, etc
   occasionally require transition through Laughlin’s Class C airspace, and practice area. This
   may occur with little or no warning. These aircraft have priority over all aircraft except
   emergencies.
   5.7.2. When possible, RAPCON will notify the Tower of inbound ETA of Air Ambulance
   traffic when it is approximately 20 nm out or as soon as possible after initial contact. Tower
   will then notify the RSU.
   5.7.3. Tower will instruct the RSU(s) to, ―Implement Airlife Procedures, advise when
   pattern is raised.‖ RSU(s) shall raise the pattern immediately and when necessary advise
   Tower of any delay.
   5.7.4. Airlife/AirMed/AirCare Procedures. The affected RSU will direct all aircraft to climb
   to/maintain pattern altitude and carry straight through initial prior to the ETA to allow the
   priority aircraft to transition their airspace. When all pattern aircraft are established at or
   above 2100’ MSL, the affected RSU(s) will advise Tower that the pattern is ―raised.‖ Tower
   will then approve the priority aircraft to cross the Class C airspace at or below 1600’ MSL.
   All pattern aircraft must remain at or above 2100’ MSL until termination of
   Airlife/AirMed/AirCare procedures. In the event an RSU controlled aircraft needs to land
   while Airlife/AirMed/AirCare procedures are in effect, the RSU will coordinate with tower.
   Tower will then provide traffic deconfliction between the dissimilar aircraft.
LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010                                                               67


   5.7.5. When the priority aircraft is clear of the RSU pattern, tower will notify the RSU(s) to,
   ―Terminate AIRLIFE/AIRMED procedures.‖
   5.7.6. Laughlin Arrivals/Departures
      5.7.6.1. Air Ambulance Priority Ground Request Notification. Tower/RAPCON will
      notify AMOPS as soon as possible of the ETA and any special ground handling requests
      made by Air Ambulance crewmembers. AMOPS will pass this information on to the
      appropriate agencies for action.
      5.7.6.2. When the aircraft notifies Tower it is ready for departure, Tower will inform
      RAPCON and RSU(s) and implement AIRLIFE Procedures.
5.8. VORA and VOR/DMEB at Del Rio International
   5.8.1. The VORA and VOR/DMEB approaches into Del Rio International Airport require
   special handling, as they conflict with the T-6 RSU patterns. VOR approaches will be given
   as a last option. A civilian aircraft requesting these approaches will be offered an alternate
   approach or the visual if the weather is at or above 2000’ AGL at DRT.
   5.8.2. Coordination. RAPCON will provide the Control Tower and the T-6 RSUs with
   initial notification of the aircraft as soon as possible and include the aircraft’s ETA over the
   VORTAC. Early notification is critical to ensure time for RSU procedures to be executed for
   continued safe operations.
   5.8.3. Control Actions. RAPCON will deconflict VOR/DME with T-6 traffic.
      5.8.3.1. RSU Actions for the VORA. The T-6 RSUs empty their patterns; all aircraft
      must depart the pattern or full stop. Notify RAPCON when complete.
      5.8.3.2. RSU Actions for the VOR/DMEB. The T-6 RSU will change the status to
      Restricted Patterns and land all solos in the pattern.
   5.8.4. Conflicts. If conflicts in the RSU patterns cannot be resolved by the ETA, the T-6
   RSUs will advise RAPCON of this and provide RAPCON with an expected time for these
   conflicts to be resolved. RAPCON will not allow the aircraft on the approach to depart the
   VOR inbound until the RSU conflicts are resolved.
5.9. Transient Aircraft Procedures
   5.9.1. Transient Aircraft Landing on a RSU Controlled Runway Per AETCI 11-204,
   transient or dissimilar aircraft will not be controlled by an RSU. In the event that a transient
   must be recovered or launched on a RSU controlled runway the following procedures will be
   used:
      5.9.1.1. IAW AETC 11-204, approaches under tower and RADAR control are not
      integrated with RSU-controlled traffic unless direct communications are established
      between the RSU, Tower and RAPCON.
      5.9.1.2. Tower will receive landing clearance or denial from RSU when the
      transient/local sidestep aircraft is at 12 miles.
      5.9.1.3. Use the terminology ―CLEARED TO LAND‖ or ―CLEARED FOR LOW
      APPROACH‖ or ―CLEARED FOR LOW APPROACH AT OR ABOVE (ALTITUDE)‖
68                                                 LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


     (include all necessary landing information); or ―UNABLE TO APPROVE THE
     APPROACH: EXPECT ____ MINUTE DELAY.‖
     5.9.1.4. When clearance is granted, the RSU controller will advise all aircraft in the
     overhead pattern that a transient/sidestep aircraft is at 10 miles, and issue cautionary
     wake turbulence advisories, if appropriate. All aircraft will carry straight-through initial;
     aircraft established in the break or closed pull-up may continue.
     5.9.1.5. In no case is an instrument/visual approach continued closer than 3 miles from
     touchdown unless it is coordinated with the RSU controller.
     5.9.1.6. Resume normal operations after landing of the transient aircraft. Only restricted
     low approaches at 500’ AGL will be allowed while the aircraft is on the runway. If
     landing clearance for the transient aircraft is denied, Tower will break the transient/side-
     step aircraft out, re-sequence the aircraft for landing, and coordinate with the RSU as
     outlined in this paragraph for landing clearance.
         5.9.1.6.1. Normally the transient/sidestep aircraft will fly a localizer/GPS approach to
         the center runway and circle or sidestep to the landing runway.                   If the
         transient/sidestep aircraft is unable to fly the localizer, a visual approach may be
         flown to the center runway. Tower will not permit the aircraft to begin maneuvering
         to the landing runway until it is inside the 4 DME point and at or below 2100’.
         5.9.1.6.2. RAPCON will notify Honcho and Lariat when a heavy aircraft is
         approaching 10 miles on final. Honcho and Lariat will issue wake turbulence
         advisories to aircraft in their patterns.
         5.9.1.6.3. Tower will advise the RSU when the aircraft begins to taxi or is on a 4
         mile final if that transient aircraft will cross an RSU controlled runway.
         5.9.1.6.4. When a transient aircraft will depart from the RSU controlled runway, the
         controller will direct all aircraft in the pattern to fly straight-through initial and inform
         Tower when no conflict exists. Tower will then issue takeoff clearance and field
         boundary restrictions to the transient aircraft. Tower will typically take control of the
         runway to depart any transient aircraft.
  5.9.2. When local flying is in progress, transient aircraft will be permitted only one approach
  to a full-stop unless the SOF, Tower Watch Supervisor, and RAPCON Watch Supervisor
  have granted approval for multiple approaches. Tower should take control of the runway to
  land the transient aircraft.
  5.9.3. IAW AETCI 11-204, only home station aircraft may fly in the RSU pattern. Transient
  aircraft must be controlled by the Tower. Within the Tower/RADAR patterns, local
  operations will receive priority over transient aircraft conducting multiple approaches unless
  pre-coordination with the OG/CC requires otherwise.
  5.9.4. Transient aircraft movements may be restricted due to ramp/runway weight bearing
  capacity and/or wingspan. In most cases, transient aircraft will utilize runway 13C/31C and
  taxiways Alpha and Foxtrot.
  5.9.5. RAPCON will advise Tower of inbound/outbound transient aircraft. Tower will
  advise AMOPS. AMOPS will relay taxi route based on aircraft weight. When requested,
  RAPCON will relay landing weight to AM so that they may determine the appropriate
LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010                                                          69


   landing runway. Emergency aircraft will be permitted to land on the center runway
   regardless of weight, unless the pilot specifically requests landing on a different runway.
      5.9.5.1. Drag Chutes. Tower will inform AMOPS of aircraft with drag chutes when the
      aircraft is 10 flying miles from Laughlin AFB. AMOPS will then inform Transient Alert
      who will hold short of the runway until authorized to proceed on and retrieve the chute.
      The SOF will determine if the runway requires a sweep.
5.10. RSU Center Runway Operations.
   5.10.1. RSU Control of Center Runway
      5.10.1.1. When it is necessary for either RSU to assume control of the center runway due
      to runway closure, emergencies, and so forth, RSU personnel will advise Tower that they
      need the runway and Tower will then coordinate with RAPCON. All aircraft outside of
      10 DME will be held or sent to RSU pattern entry points. All aircraft inside 10 DME will
      complete their approaches. When center runway environment is sterile, Tower will
      relinquish control.
      5.10.1.2. If the RSU has an emergency aircraft that must land immediately, the RSU will
      coordinate with Tower for landing clearance and traffic information. Aircraft inside 10
      DME will be instructed to break out.
      5.10.1.3. After receiving control of the center runway, the T-6 RSU controller will give
      Tower control of the inside runway to ensure emergency vehicles have free access to the
      runway. Tower will use the runway for ground traffic only. Tower will not launch or
      recover aircraft on the runway.
      5.10.1.4. In the event of an emergency/transient aircraft recovering to Laughlin, Tower
      will coordinate with Honcho to resume control of the runway to land the
      emergency/transient on the center runway. Honcho will retain control of the inside
      pattern until the runway can be returned from Tower. If the emergency aircraft disables
      the center runway, refer to Single Runway Operations.
5.11. Runway Change Procedures.
   5.11.1. A tailwind component of five knots or greater normally requires a runway change.
   The SOF will determine the Runway Change Time (RCT). If practical, the RCT should
   factor in RSU change times and allow at least 30 minutes to enable barrier crews to be in
   place to reconfigure the barriers.
   5.11.2. Wizard Procedures. The SOF will advise RAPCON and Fire Emergency Services
   Flight of expected Wizard RCT. The Wizard pattern will close at RCT 15 to allow the crew
   to move to the other RSU. The Wizard crew will advise RAPCON when they close for
   runway change and when they reopen. Except for emergencies, RAPCON will not clear
   aircraft to Wizard while it is closed.

               Figure 5.3. Runway Change Sequence of Events
70                                                LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


     SOF        - Once the SOF advises the Tower Watch Supervisor of the RCT, Tower
     requests   will be the coordinating agency. Tower will notify RAPCON, AM and
     runway     Fire Emergency Services Flight of the RCT. AM will notify Barrier
     change     Maintenance to be in place NLT RCT-20. In the event Barrier
                Maintenance cannot be located or respond, AM will notify the Fire
                Emergency Services Flight to respond.
                - The SOF notifies the existing RSU crews, squadron Sups, and 47
                OG/CC of the RCT.
                - The Tower and RAPCON will broadcast the RCT on all frequencies
                (including an initial call on guard by RAPCON) at 5 minute intervals.
                - New RSU crews will depart to ensure they are in place NLT RCT-5.
                Advise the SOF when ready to assume pattern responsibilities. If new
                RSU crew is not available then coordinate for Tower to take the pattern
                while current crew relocates.
                - Tower gives time hack to the RSUs.
     RCT-30     - The Tower and RAPCON will broadcast the RCT on all frequencies,
                including an initial call on guard by RAPCON, at 5-minute intervals.
     RCT-25     - Confirm Barrier Maintenance has been notified and will be in place by
                RCT-20
     RCT-20     - Allow Barrier Maintenance or Fire Emergency Services Flight runway
                access to reconfigure barriers.
     RCT-15     - Stop all aircraft from taxiing for departure.
                - Hold aircraft in the area until RCT.
                - Taxiing to the new runway will begin at Tower’s discretion, when no
     RCT-5      conflicts will occur.
                - Tower confirms new RSU crews are in place. (If the RSU crew will not
                be in place for the new runway at RCT, tower will know they have to take
                control of the runway at RCT).
                - Aircraft inside 10 DME will continue to a restricted low approach (500’
                AGL) to the center runway. Aircraft outside 10 DME will be vectored to
                the new runway.
                - Aircraft at entry points will hold at entry point until RCT.
                - T-6 aircraft do not depart OTULE for the new runway until RCT.
                - Lariat will coordinate with Tower for aircraft requiring full-stop.
                - Tower/RSUs direct all pattern traffic to fly straight through initial (no
     RCT-2      closed patterns). Aircraft that have initiated the break will continue their
                pattern.
                - Takeoffs are discontinued.
                - RAPCON will vector T-38s/T-1As for a straight-in to the new landing
                runway.
                - Tower retains control of the center runway.
LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010                                                                 71


                - Tower informs AMOPS, RSUs and RAPCON, ―Runway 13/31 now in
     RCT        use.‖
                - Barriers reconfigured
                - The new RSUs and Tower directs all pattern aircraft to climb to the
                breakout altitude and exit in sequence as depicted in the applicable IFG.
                - Tower/RSUs broadcast landing instructions for the new runway change

5.12. Emergency Runway Change
   5.12.1. The objective is to safely and expeditiously recover aircraft unable to fly through a
   normal runway change. RSU crews will notify the SOF if aircraft are unable to handle
   current landing conditions. The SOF (when on duty), in coordination with the Tower Watch
   Supervisor, will determine the active runway. The SOF will direct Emergency Runway
   Change Procedures. The RAPCON will determine the last aircraft for the current runway
   after coordination with the Tower Watch Supervisor and SOF. The wing flying status reverts
   to Standby.
   5.12.2. Launches will stop and aircraft outside 10 DME will be directed to the new runway.
   Aircraft inside 10 DME will continue on approach. When traffic conditions permit
   approaches and departures will resume to new runway (this is the RCT).
   5.12.3. The Tower/RSUs will direct all aircraft to climb to the breakout altitude and exit in
   sequence as depicted in the applicable IFG. Tower/RSUs will broadcast landing instructions
   for the new runway. Aircraft will either full-stop or carry straight through initial. Honcho
   and Lariat will continue to control traffic from the departure end RSU until the new RSU
   crew is in place and ready to assume control from the approach end RSU.
   5.12.4. Restricted Patterns. Aircrews can expect the following directions from Lariat/Tower:
   ―ALL AIRCRAFT WITH SUFFICIENT FUEL, FLY STRAIGHT THROUGH INITIAL
   AND DEPART. ALL OTHER AIRCRAFT ON THE TURN FROM 90TOINITIAL OR
   45TOINITIAL, PROCEED DIRECT TO INSIDE DOWNWIND AND CONFIGURE FOR
   A FULLSTOP LANDING TO THE NEW INSIDE /CENTER RUNWAY.‖ Aircraft
   entering Lariat’s pattern from the center runway will be sequenced into the closed pattern via
   a low closed. T-1 aircraft will not enter the Tower pattern until the emergency runway
   change is complete.
   5.12.5. The Fire Emergency Services Flight will respond immediately to perform required
   barrier maintenance for emergency runway changes. Barrier Maintenance will respond as
   soon as possible.
5.13. Suspended/Closed Runway Operations. AMOPS will suspend/close runway operations
when any unsafe condition affects runway operations (e.g. FOD, pavement repair, aircraft
mishap etc).
   5.13.1. When the flying status is Instruments, tower controls all runways and will direct
   landing information to aircraft. During runway closures, consideration should be given to
   closing the airfield to transient aircraft, and/or diverting inbound aircraft.
   5.13.2. It is essential that a radio call on Guard is made to ensure all aircraft are aware of the
   situation. The Tower will notify AMOPS of suspended runway operations. If AMOPS
72                                                LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


  determines that it is necessary to suspend runway operations they will notify the Tower
  ASAP. AMOPS will perform a FOD check and will advise tower when normal operations
  are resumed. The SOF will also ensure that both RSUs are aware of the closure. RAPCON
  will announce the suspended runway ops call on Guard frequency.
  5.13.3. If only one runway remains open (or one useable runway for T38s), all aircraft shall
  land with sufficient fuel to divert to the designated alternate.
  5.13.4. Single Runway Operations.
     5.13.4.1. Initial Response.
         5.13.4.1.1. The SOF/ATC will coordinate to decide if all airframes will go Stop
         Launch.
         5.13.4.1.2. SOF/ATC will decide if all landings are full stop only.
         5.13.4.1.3. SOF will ensure that all aircraft are notified that single runway operations
         are in effect.
     5.13.4.2. Inside runway open. T-6s recover via normal procedures to a full-stop. T-1s
     will coordinate to land on the inside runway, TOLD permitting, or divert. T-38s divert to
     a suitable alternate. If necessary, T38s may have to consider landing on the inside
     runway or diverting to Wizard (two T-38s maximum at Wizard).
     5.13.4.3. Outside or Center Runway Open. All aircrews monitor Tower’s frequency,
     report fuel state on initial, and fly straight through initial in their respective patterns
     unless cleared to break. Aircraft will break in the normal direction of their respective
     pattern. After clearance to break adjust the final turn to land on the open runway. The
     Tower controller controls all aircraft, except student solos, and ensures that only one type
     aircraft is cleared to land at a time.
     5.13.4.4. Once the VFR patterns have been cleared, Tower will remain in control of all
     runways. After initial recovery of airborne aircraft, the 47 OG/CC may decide to resume
     limited operations. All aircraft will land with divert fuel.
  5.13.5. Dual Runway Ops - Outside runway closed
     5.13.5.1. Initial Response.
         5.13.5.1.1. SOF/ATC will coordinate if all airframes will go Stop Launch.
         5.13.5.1.2. Lariat will instruct aircraft in the pattern to fly straight through initial. If
         no solo students are airborne, Lariat will relinquish control of the outside pattern to
         tower. If solo students are airborne, Lariat will maintain control of the pattern and
         coordinate with tower for control of the center runway. Pattern aircraft will not be
         cleared for a straight-in on RWY 13C/31C until all aircraft inside 10 DME for the
         center have been sequenced.
         5.13.5.1.3. The SOF will coordinate with Lariat/T-38 Sup to determine if any/all T-
         38 solos should be recalled to the pattern.
         5.13.5.1.4. Due to insufficient spacing between runways, base turns may not be
         flown to the center runway from the outside pattern if the overhead to the inside
LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010                                                             73


        runway is active. If the T-6 pattern is active, T-6’s will recover via straight-in full
        stop or depart the pattern.
     5.13.5.2. Continued Operations
        5.13.5.2.1. T-38s assume single runway operations.
        5.13.5.2.2. T-38s and T-6s will coordinate for windows in which to conduct overhead
        pattern operations on their respective runways. If T-38 status is Restricted Patterns or
        better, T-1’s will also schedule separate flying periods from the T-38’s.
  5.13.6. Dual Runway Ops – Center Runway Closure.
     5.13.6.1. Initial Response.
        5.13.6.1.1. SOF/ATC will coordinate if all airframes will go Stop Launch.
        5.13.6.1.2. If above sidestep minimums, aircraft on final for the center runway will
        sidestep to the appropriate runway. If traffic doesn’t permit the sidestep, aircraft on
        the center will low approach and either request closed to appropriate runway or
        execute the standard climbout to RADAR.
        5.13.6.1.3. Lariat will clear their pattern and relinquish control of the outside runway
        to the Tower. T-38 solos will be recalled to a full-stop.
        5.13.6.1.4. If weather conditions do not support pattern operations, aircraft will
        recover via approach the center and sidestep to the appropriate runway. If weather is
        below sidestep minimums, then aircraft will divert.
            5.13.6.1.4.1. The sidestep from 13C to 13L is not authorized at night. Therefore,
            aircraft may commence a circling approach to 13L. If required to circle in order
            to land and weather is below circling minimums, aircraft will divert.
     5.13.6.2. Continued Operations.
        5.13.6.2.1. T-6s will not fly approaches to the center runway.          If the situation
        dictates, T38s/T1s may fly restricted low approaches.
        5.13.6.2.2. T-6s/T-1s normal minimum fuels apply. T-38s will land with divert fuel.
        5.13.6.2.3. T-1’s and T-38’s will arrange for separate flying periods to facilitate RSU
        control for the T-38 pattern and solos.
  5.13.7. Dual Runway Ops – Inside Runway Closure
     5.13.7.1. Initial Response
        5.13.7.1.1. SOF/ATC will coordinate if all airframes will go Stop Launch
        5.13.7.1.2. Honcho will instruct aircraft in the pattern to fly straight through initial.
        If the runway closure is expected to last approximately 20 minutes or less, Honcho
        will retain control of the pattern and give Tower access to the runway surface. If the
        runway closure is expected to last longer than 20 minutes, Honcho will coordinate
        with Tower to take control of the center runway in order to land solo students in
        sequence under RSU control. After all T-6 solos have landed, Honcho may
        coordinate for Tower to take control of aircraft in their pattern. Pattern aircraft will
74                                              LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


        not land on 13C/31C until all aircraft inside 10 DME for the center runway have been
        sequenced. Honcho will advise RAPCON to stop arrivals prior to pattern saturation.
        5.13.7.1.3. The SOF will coordinate with Honcho/T-6 Sup to determine if any/all T-6
        solos should be recalled to the pattern. Solo aircraft will remain in Honcho’s pattern
        to land on the center runway under RSU control. All solo students will fly one
        overhead to a full stop.
        5.13.7.1.4. T-6 takeoffs on the center runway when the inside runway is closed will
        be VFR and comply with MARSA procedures in para 4.2.1. If the LAUGHLIN ONE
        departure is desired, crews will make that request with their number one call.
        5.13.7.1.5. DELETED
        5.13.7.1.6. Continued Operations
        5.13.7.1.7. T-6s will continue operations on the center runway. The SOF will
        coordinate with the T-6/T-38 Sup to determine whether to operate under Tower or
        Honcho control. In the event of a transient aircraft arrival, refer to paragraph 5.9.
        5.13.7.1.8. If the T-38 VFR pattern is open, the outside runway can continue to
        operate under normal Tower/Lariat schedules. If Lariat controls the outside while
        Honcho is controlling the center, traffic will be sequenced IAW paragraph 5.13.7. If
        Lariat controls the outside while Tower is controlling the center, Lariat will operate
        normally.
     5.13.7.2. Extended Inside Runway Closure
        5.13.7.2.1. When all T-6 solo aircraft have landed, transfer control of the center
        runway to tower.
        5.13.7.2.2. Tower or Lariat will control 13L/31R under normal control schedules.
        5.13.7.2.3. T-6 aircraft under tower control will plan to fly one pattern to a full stop
        5.13.7.2.4. T-38s/T-1s departing from the center runway will operate normally. T-6s
        departing from the center runway will depart VFR and comply with MARSA
        procedures in paragraph 4.2.1. unless prior coordination with Tower has taken place
        to depart IFR on the LAUGHLIN ONE departure or the QWAIL ROUTE.
        5.13.7.2.5. If Honcho controls runway 13C/31C:
           5.13.7.2.5.1. Runway 31C. T-6s will land past a simulated threshold abeam
           taxiway foxtrot when landing on runway 31C to comply with AETCI 11-204 RSU
           locations.
           5.13.7.2.5.2. In the event of an emergency/transient aircraft recovering to
           Laughlin, Tower will coordinate with Honcho to resume control of the runway to
           land the emergency/transient on the center. Honcho will retain control of the
           inside pattern until the runway can be returned from tower. If the emergency
           aircraft disables the center runway, refer to Single Runway Operations in this
           instruction. T-6s will carry straight through initial when tower controlled aircraft
           are inside 10 mile final until clear of the runway.
           5.13.7.2.5.3. Instrument approaches will not normally be authorized.
LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010                                                                 75


              5.13.7.2.5.4. DELETED
              5.13.7.2.5.5. All aircraft landing on the outside runway will contact Ground when
              clear of the outside and needing to cross the center. Ground will inform crews
              which agency to contact for crossing clearance. All crews will transmit a holding
              short call with location and will call when clear of the runway when crossing is
              complete.
5.14. Operation of the Primary and Secondary Crash Net
   5.14.1. The Tower will activate the primary crash network (Figure 5.4.) when:
       5.14.1.1. There is an aircraft mishap, inflight or ground emergency (including Wizard).
       5.14.1.2. There is a barrier engagement/request.
       5.14.1.3. There is a bomb threat to aircraft or hangars.
       5.14.1.4. There is a suspected or actual aircraft hijacking.
       5.14.1.5. A disaster occurs.
       5.14.1.6. Receiving information of NBC attack.
       5.14.1.7. Deemed necessary in the interest of safety, security, and resource protection.
NOTE: When directed to do so, Tower will activate the primary crash network to support base
exercises. All calls will be prefaced with ―Exercise, exercise, exercise‖ and will end with
―Exercise, exercise, exercise, out.‖
       5.14.1.8. To pass updated information on a previously declared emergency. (i.e., the
       original plan was to taxi clear of the runway and subsequent reports/plans indicate a plan
       to stop on the runway).
       5.14.1.9. There is an unauthorized landing at Laughlin or Wizard.
   5.14.2. AMOPS activates the Secondary crash network when:
       5.14.2.1. Required to relay information verbatim from Primary Crash Phone Activation
       5.14.2.2. Inflight/Ground Emergencies received from other than PCAS sources.
       5.14.2.3. FPCON level changes
       5.14.2.4. Hazardous weather warnings are received
       5.14.2.5. EOC activated or recalls
       5.14.2.6. Notified of bomb threats or terrorist activities
       5.14.2.7. Necessary to relay information critical to aircraft and airfield operations
   5.14.3. The Tower will perform the daily primary crash phone check before the field opens.
   AMOPS will perform a daily check of the secondary crash system between 0730L and
   0830L. On weekends and night flying, the check will be done before airfield opening.
   AMOPS will test the backup secondary crash system quarterly.
   5.14.4. After normal duty hours, the FSO is notified by Command Post.

5.15. Emergency Aircraft/Response Procedures
   5.15.1. Pilots who experience an emergency will notify the controlling agency and the SOF
   time permitting. If the SOF learns of an emergency on his/her frequency or through some
   means other than the Single Frequency Approach (SFA) discrete frequency, the SOF will
   notify Tower and RAPCON Watch Supervisors with available information. The controlling
   agency (RAPCON/TOWER/RSU) should request the PIC to use the emergency SFA discrete
   frequency to minimize channel changes and enhance communications. The SFA discrete
   frequency is an ATC frequency used to issue ATC clearances and control instructions.
   Command and control (SOF, Squadron Sups, etc.) may monitor this frequency to maintain
   situational awareness. Command and control shall obtain permission from ATC prior to
   transmitting on the SFA discrete frequency to communicate with distressed aircraft. Aircrews
   will remain on this frequency until the aircraft has landed with the Tower and frequency
   change approved.
   5.15.2. Incident Commander Responsibilities. The Incident Commander will adhere to the
   guidance set forth in LAFB CEMP 10-2, Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan, and
   AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, paragraph 2.8.
   5.15.3. SOF and Control Agency Responsibilities. ―The controlling agency (RSU,
   RAPCON) that receives an emergency call from a pilot relays the information to the Tower.
   The Tower will advise the SOF, and the SOF will notify the RSUs as appropriate.‖
   5.15.4. RAPCON will notify the Tower of aircraft observed squawking 7700 or 7600.
   Tower activates the primary crash net for all emergencies (Figure 5.4) and will notify the
   appropriate RSU and the center monitor of emergency aircraft inbound to the center runway.
   AMOPS will activate the Secondary Crash Net (Figure 5.4.) on all emergencies. Tower will
   advise the Fire Emergency Services Flight, AMOPS, and Transient Alert via FM net when
LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010                                                             77


  the emergency aircraft is next to land. The Tower will notify AMOPS if a runway check is
  required and if runway operations are suspended.
     5.15.4.1. In the event of an accident or emergency at Wizard, the controller will relay the
     information to the SOF by telephone, or direct any local airborne aircraft to relay the
     pertinent information to the SOF.
     5.15.4.2. The RSU controller may act independently of the SOF and take the necessary
     action to help and advise emergency aircraft when time is critical. In such cases, the
     RSU controller will tell the SOF of the action as soon as possible.
  5.15.5. RSU/Tower/RAPCON Procedures. Emergency landings may be made on any
  runway. Normally, T-6 aircraft land on the inside runway and T38/T1 aircraft land on the
  center runway to allow for accessibility of fire-fighting equipment. Emergency aircraft (not
  established in an RSU pattern) landing on the center runway are normally controlled by
  Tower. The appropriate RSU controller/center monitor will monitor the appropriate
  frequency. This will enable the Lariat center monitor and/or Honcho controller to properly
  monitor the aircraft’s landing.
     5.15.5.1. Emergency aircraft established in Honcho’s pattern. Honcho will advise the
     SOF and Tower when an aircraft under their control has declared an emergency. Honcho
     will advise the SOF and Tower of the aircraft’s callsign, nature of emergency, pilot’s
     intentions, ETA, and landing runway. When the aircraft is making its final circuit of the
     pattern prior to landing, the RSU controller will advise the Tower when the emergency
     aircraft is both mid-field outside downwind and next to land. Honcho will then broadcast
     to their pattern aircraft that an emergency aircraft is arriving and Honcho will soon only
     be accepting restricted low approaches at or above 500’ AGL. Once the emergency
     aircraft has landed, Honcho will coordinate with Tower to relinquish control of the inside
     runway and subsequent arrivals will only be allowed to conduct restricted low
     approaches. At this time, Tower will control the inside runway meaning the Tower
     controls the runway surface and all ground traffic. Honcho remains in control of inside
     runway pattern operations which during emergency response means they will solve all
     airborne traffic conflicts. Once the emergency aircraft and all ground traffic is clear of
     the inside runway, tower will return control of the runway back to Honcho.
     5.15.5.2. Emergency T-6 Aircraft Requesting to Land on the Center Runway.
     Emergency aircraft in Honcho’s pattern will normally remain on Honcho’s frequency for
     landing. Honcho will advise tower when the aircraft is on the midfield outside downwind
     with pilot’s intentions for a 5 NM straight-in or an initial pattern. Tower will resolve all
     traffic conflicts and issue clearance for the aircraft to land on the center runway to
     Honcho. Honcho will not let the emergency aircraft line-up on the center runway until
     Tower has given clearance to land. Honcho will advise the emergency aircraft when
     tower has cleared them to land on the center runway. Honcho will then broadcast to their
     pattern aircraft that an emergency aircraft is arriving to the center runway and Honcho
     will soon only be accepting restricted low approaches at or above 500’ AGL. After
     broadcasting the advisory, Honcho will resolve all traffic conflicts and relinquish control
     of the inside runway to Tower. Tower will control the runway surface and Honcho will
     remain in control of inside runway pattern operations. Honcho will allow subsequent
     arrivals to the inside runway to conduct restricted low approaches only. If the Tower has
78                                                LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


     not given the emergency aircraft clearance to land by 2 NM or base turn, Honcho will
     clear the aircraft to land on the inside runway. Tower will return inside runway access to
     Honcho as soon as normal traffic may be resumed.
     5.15.5.3. Emergency Aircraft Requiring Immediate Clearance to Land on the Center
     Runway. The RSU controller will issue the following phraseology to the Tower,
     ―Immediate Clearance to Land on Center Runway.‖ Tower will breakout its traffic and
     issue Honcho landing clearance once all traffic conflicts have been resolved.
     5.15.5.4. Honcho Operations during Emergency Vehicle Response. When Honcho is
     operational and an emergency aircraft is recovering to the center or outside runway, fire-
     fighting vehicles and emergency response vehicles will need clearance from Honcho
     (through Tower) to cross the inside runway. Tower will inform Honcho when the aircraft
     is at 15 NM. If the aircraft is in Lariat’s pattern, Lariat informs Tower, who will inform
     Honcho when the aircraft is midfield outside downwind. Honcho will then broadcast to
     their pattern aircraft that an emergency aircraft is arriving, and Honcho will soon only be
     accepting restricted low approaches at or above 500’ AGL. Tower will inform Honcho
     when the emergency aircraft is 4 NM. At this time, Honcho stops departures and accepts
     restricted low approaches only. Honcho will inform Tower when the runway is clear and
     give them ―access‖ (meaning Tower will handle all ground movements, to include taxiing
     aircraft). Honcho will maintain ―control‖ of the inside runway pattern operations, which
     during the emergency response, means they will resolve all airborne traffic conflicts.
     Tower will return access to Honcho when normal traffic may be resumed.
     5.15.5.5. Emergencies in Lariat’s Pattern. Lariat will advise the SOF and Tower when
     an aircraft in its pattern has declared an emergency. Lariat will tell the SOF and Tower
     the nature of the emergency, the estimated time of arrival and which runway the aircraft
     will be landing on. When the aircraft is making its final circuit of the pattern prior to
     landing, the RSU controller will tell Tower when the aircraft is midfield outside
     downwind. At this point, Tower (if able) will give clearance to land to the aircraft on the
     center runway (if needed). Emergency aircraft in Lariat’s pattern will normally remain
     on Lariat’s frequency for landing unless landing on a tower-controlled runway and/or
     Tower has Lariat’s frequency dialed up on the backup radio. Lariat will tell Tower when
     the aircraft is 9 NM (straight-in) or in the break (overhead). Lariat will not let the aircraft
     lineup on the center runway until Tower has given clearance to land. If Tower has not
     given clearance to land by 4 NM, Lariat will clear the aircraft to land on the outside
     runway. If a distressed aircraft needs immediate clearance to land on the center runway,
     the RSU controller will request from Tower ―IMMEDIATE CLEARANCE TO LAND.‖
     Tower will breakout its traffic and grant clearance to land as soon as possible.
        5.15.5.5.1. If the distressed aircraft will be landing on the outside runway, Tower will
        stop departures and accept restricted low approaches only, when the aircraft is at 4
        NM (straight-in) or in the break (overhead), to allow accessibility of fire-fighting
        equipment.
     5.15.5.6. When a distressed aircraft is inbound for landing on the center runway, Tower
     will stop departures when the aircraft is at 10 DME (or midfield outside downwind in
     Lariat’s pattern). Unforeseen emergency situations may dictate the need to stop
LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010                                                               79


      departures, clear the hammerhead, clear the patterns, etc. If such a situation arises, the
      SOF will give the appropriate instructions to the Tower/RSU(s).
      5.15.5.7. If the situation warrants, an RSU controller may coordinate to take control of
      the center runway.
   5.15.6. Fire Emergency Services Flight. The Fire Chief/Assistant Fire Chief must have
   access to the runway during an emergency; however, it may be necessary to continue
   landings (minimum fuel or emergency). The Fire Emergency Services Flight /fire vehicle
   operators will be made aware of the situation. Once clearance is received, they will make a
   visual check before proceeding onto, or crossing an active runway. Tower/RSU controllers
   will keep the fire protection crew fully informed about conflicting traffic during an
   emergency. The Fire Chief will monitor the landing frequency of all emergency aircraft until
   termination of the emergency.
   5.15.7. The SOF will determine the category of each emergency and relay this information
   to the Fire Emergency Services Flight.
   5.15.8. Anytime an aircraft emergency is declared, on or off station, the Pilot in Command
   will ensure that an AETC Form 6454, Trend Data Report, is completed in a timely manner
   and turned in to the squadron flight safety officer or wing safety.
5.16. Hot Armament or Dangerous Cargo/Hung Ordnance
   5.16.1. AMOPS notifies the SOF and Tower of the Arrival or departure of aircraft with hot
   armament (guns, missiles, and bombs) or dangerous material on board.
      5.16.1.1. Arriving aircraft carrying hot armament landing on runway 13C will taxi to the
      south hammerhead across from taxiway Hotel. If Runway 31 is in use, aircraft will land
      and make a RIGHT 180-degree turn and back-taxi to the south hammerhead across from
      taxiway Hotel. Tower will issue progressive taxi instructions if necessary.
      5.16.1.2. When clear of the center runway, aircraft will point southeast in the south
      hammerhead and shut down. Transient Alert and Ground Safety will further assist the
      aircraft.
      5.16.1.3. If unable to taxi to the south hammerhead, Transient Alert will park aircraft
      faced away from populated areas.
      5.16.1.4. Arriving aircraft carrying dangerous cargo will land and shut down engines on
      the departure end of runway 13L. If landing runway 31R, aircraft will land and make a
      RIGHT 180-degree turn and back-taxi to the south end of the runway.
   5.16.2. Aircraft will not operate (run engines) on the closed portions of the airfield.
      5.16.2.1. Aircraft experiencing a hydrazine accident will be handled the same as
      hazardous cargo.
5.17. Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT)
   5.17.1. Any agency or aircraft receiving an emergency locator transmitter will notify the
   nearest FAA or military air traffic control facility. If known, relay aircraft position and time
   the signal was first heard, last heard, aircraft position at maximum signal strength, flight
   altitude and frequency (121.5/243.0) of the signal, and any other pertinent information

5.18. ATC Emergency Facility Evacuation/Relocation Procedures
   5.18.1. Evacuating personnel will notify all traffic of evacuation and advise they contact
   Tower, RAPCON, Houston ARTCC, or RSU as appropriate. The SOF will initiate Stop
   Launch status for either RAPCON or Tower evacuation.
   5.18.2. Tower Emergency Relocation Procedures: The Tower will evacuate when advised by
   competent authority for safety of personnel. The Tower will release the runway to an
   operating RSU (if one is active) while relocating. The SOF will direct Stop Launch with all
   airframes. Aircraft planning to land on a Tower controlled runway (now uncontrolled) should
   go around and contact the appropriate RSU or RAPCON. Aircraft should not attempt to land
   on an uncontrolled runway unless a greater hazard exists.
       5.18.2.1. The SOF will relocate to the T-6 Duty Desk.
       5.18.2.2. RAPCON Emergency Relocation Procedures: The RAPCON will advise
       Houston ARTCC and broadcast on all frequencies that the RAPCON is evacuating and
       advise aircraft to maintain VFR, and if unable, to contact ZHU for IFR services. The
       RAPCON watch supervisor will send two qualified controllers (at least one seven level)
       to the Tower to facilitate emergency approach control services; traditional non-radar

FLANK                   SCAB



  A2.2. Local vs. Off-Station Callsigns
         A2.2.1. Off station/stereo callsigns will be used on any sortie that departs Laughlin AFB
         controlled airspace (cross country, outandback, stereo, etc.). Otherwise, use the local
         callsign. Formation callsigns are considered ―local.‖ If a formation’s flight profile does not
         meet ―local‖ criteria, use an off station callsign.
         A2.2.2. Flights to the local MOAs (Ski, Ranch, and Burr) will use local callsigns if they will
         not otherwise depart Laughlin-controlled airspace.
  A2.3. Formation Callsigns. Formation callsigns will be coordinated/assigned through the Duty
  Desk prior to the formation briefing. The Duty Desk will not re-assign formation callsigns once
  issued until the previous flight has returned.
  A2.4. Squadron Supervisor Callsigns (SUPT). To facilitate ready identification of squadron
  supervisors (Sq CC/DO/ADOs) to RAPCON, Tower, SOF, etc., the following procedures will be
  used:
         A2.4.1. On single-ship local sorties, squadron supervisors (Sq CC/DO/ADOs, and other
         highly experienced IPs at the discretion of the squadron CC) will use the standard squadron
         local callsign with a permanently assigned numerical suffix beginning with ―0‖ (e.g. —Bully
         01, Tone 03, Texan 08, Tiger 02).
  A2.5. Special Use Callsigns
         A2.5.1. DV Flights. DV Flights will normally use ―Excel 47‖ as the callsign. If more than
         one flight is scheduled, any non-VIP numerical suffix may be used.

Separation…

   A.3.1. RSRS will be applied for all aircraft based on guidance in AFI 13-204, AETC
   Supplement 1. RSUs will utilize RSRS in accordance with AETCI 11-204.

   A.3.2. Laughlin air traffic controllers are authorized to use RSRS between AETC-assigned
   aircraft when controllers are able to see the aircraft involved and determine distances by
   references to suitable landmarks. Reduced runway separation may be applied in accordance with
   the criteria specified in this section between Arrival following Arrival, Arrival following
   departure and departure following departure operations. For departure following Arrival, a
   preceding landing aircraft, regardless of category, must be clear of the runway before the
   departure begins a takeoff roll. These standards apply on all tower-controlled runways.

   A.3.3. Any aircrew or air traffic controller may refuse RSRS when safety of flight may be
   jeopardized. In these cases, apply appropriate separation standards published in FAAO 7110.65.

   A.3.4. Aircraft will not overfly other aircraft in departure position. Responsibility for
   separation rests with the pilot.

   A.3.5. Pilots are responsible for wake turbulence separation when maintaining visual separation
   or operating under VFR. When operating IFR or under ATC instructions, controllers must
   ensure standard wake turbulence separation exists.

   A.3.6. RSRS will not be applied:

   A.3.6.1. Between trainer-type aircraft and any other non-trainer aircraft. Trainer-type aircraft is
   defined as a T-6, T-38 or a T-1 aircraft.

   A.3.6.2. To any situation involving an aircraft ―CLEARED FOR THE OPTION.‖

   A.3.6.3. Between a Departure following an Arrival aircraft.

   A.3.6.4. When the runway is wet.

   A.3.6.5. When the tower watch supervisor determines that safety of aircraft will be jeopardized.

   A.3.6.6. The 47 OG/CC is the approving authority to authorize RSRS during wet runway
   operations based on local surface conditions.

   A.3.7. Alternate Runway Side Procedures.

   A.3.7.1. T-6/T-38 aircrews are responsible for using alternate sides of the runway IAW aircraft
   directives. Tower controllers will consider alternate runway side procedures in effect at all times
 98                                                LAUGHLINAFBI13-203 21 AUGUST 2010


except when specified by the SOF, during night operations or when crosswind procedures are in
effect.

A.3.7.2. T-1 aircraft will not use alternate runway side procedures.

A.3.8. T-6s.

A.3.8.1. When a T-6 aircraft is following another T-6 and alternate runway side procedures are
used, the minimum separation is 3000’ or once the preceding aircraft is airborne. 6000’ is the
minimum separation required or preceding aircraft is airborne for low approach behind touch and
go and touch and go behind full stop.

A.3.8.2. When a T-6 aircraft is following a T-6 formation and both formation aircraft are on the
cold (exit) side of the runway, minimum separation is 3000’ or once preceding aircraft is
airborne. 6000’ minimum separation required or preceding aircraft is airborne for low approach
behind touch and go and touch and go behind full stop.

A.3.8.3. When a T-6 aircraft is following a formation, a T-38, a T-1, or when alternate runway
side procedures are not used, minimum separation is 6000’.

A.3.8.4. When a T-6 formation is following another AETC trainer-type aircraft, minimum
separation is 6000’.

A.3.9. T-38s.

A.3.9.1. When a T-38 aircraft is following another T-38 and alternate runway side procedures
are used, minimum separation is 3000’ or once preceding aircraft is airborne. 6000’ minimum
separation required or preceding aircraft is airborne for low approach behind touch and go and
touch and go behind full stop.

A.3.9.2. (SUPT) Aircraft full stopping on the hot side should not transition to the cold side until
past the 2000’ remaining marker without RSU approval.

A.3.9.3. When a T-38 aircraft is following a T-38 formation and both formation aircraft are on
the cold (exit) side of the runway, minimum separation is 3000’ or once preceding aircraft is
airborne. 6000’ minimum separation required or preceding aircraft is airborne for low approach
behind touch and go and touch and go behind full stop.

  CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION OPERATIONS NEAR LAUGHLIN AFB

A4.1. The Laughlin AFB Class C inner ring (5NM radius and surface up to 5100’ MSL) will be
divided into 4 distinct areas. They are defined as follows:
   A4.1.1. ―BP NORTH‖: The DLF 270 radial clockwise to the DLF 340 radial, from DLF 2.5
   DME out to the edge of the class C, and 0 AGL up to 200’ AGL. This area is the approach
   end of runway 13 (departure RWY 31).
   A4.1.2. ―BP EAST‖: The DLF 340 radial clockwise to the DLF 090 radial, from DLF 2.5
   DME out to the edge of the class C, and 0 AGL up to 300’ AGL.
   A4.1.3. ―BP SOUTH‖: The DLF 090 radial clockwise to the DLF 160 radial, from DLF 2.5
   DME out to the edge of the class C, and 0 AGL up to 200’ AGL. This area encompasses
   Sycamore creek, off the departure end of runway 13 (approach RWY 31).
   A4.1.4. ―BP WEST‖: The DLF 160 radial clockwise to the DLF 270 radial, from DLF 2.5
   DME out to the edge of the class C, and 0 AGL up to 300’ AGL.
A4.1.5 See figure A.4.1.
A4.2. If a Customs and Border Protection aircraft desires operation inside one of these defined
areas aircraft will contact Laughlin Tower and request the desired area. Laughlin tower will then
clear the Customs and Border Protection aircraft into the requested Class C area, traffic and
controller workload permitting. Customs and Border Protection aircraft will monitor tower VHF
frequency while flying in the class C, and report when exiting.
A4.2.1 Radio verbiage:
aircraft:    ―Laughlin Tower, Border Patrol Helicopter XX request BP East‖
tower: ―Border Patrol XX, you are cleared to operate in BP East, report when vacating‖
aircraft:    ―Border Patrol XX cleared BP East‖
A4.3. If an aircraft desires operation inside 2.5 DME, it will make that request to tower on a
case by case basis, i.e., ―Request BP East into the perimeter fence, remain below 300 AGL…‖
A4.4. Tower will verify with Honcho RSU that no aircraft are on straight-in or pattern straight-
in before clearing aircraft into ―BP North‖, ―BP West‖ or ―BP South.‖ This is because an
aircraft on pattern straight-in is at 1600’ MSL (500’AGL) in the Honcho pattern. Tower will
also pass an estimated time of usage. RSU controllers should not allow pattern straight-ins
when:
   A4.4.1. ―BP West‖ or ―BP North‖ are active while on runway 13
   A4.4.2. ―BP West‖ or ―BP South‖ are active while on runway 31.
