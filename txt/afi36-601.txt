This instruction implements Air Force civilian career programs. The Air Force manages the careers of
officer-equivalent civilians through career programs. It applies to supervisors, managers, and employees;
civilian personnel staffs; and civilian employees at joint service organizations where Air Force is the
executive agent, and to other Federal civilian employees and reinstatement eligibles. It does not apply to
Air National Guard, Title 32, technicians. This instruction implements AFPD 36-6, Civilian Career Man-
agement, and implements Department of Defense Directive (DODD) 1430.2, 13 June 1981.



1. Program Objectives:
   1.1. Program Authority. The Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) (Public Law 95-454) requires exec-
   utive management in the Federal Government to be the highest quality and respond to the needs, pol-
   icies, and goals of the Nation. Specifically, it requires agencies to provide for the development of
   highly competent senior executives. In addition, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
   requires systematic development of candidates for the Senior Executive Service (SES) and the con-
   tinuing development of senior executives.
   1.2. Civilian Career Management Goals. Civilian career programs will develop employees with
   strong professional, technical, managerial, and administrative skills to satisfy current and future Air
   Force mission needs. The current force is assessed in relation to an objective force, as described in the
   US Air Force Manpower and Personnel Plan. Civilian career management will:
       • Identify and encourage highly qualified and high potential individuals to make a career in the
          Air Force.
       • Provide employees with the opportunity to improve their skills and progress through the orga-
          nization.
       • Give employees rewarding work experiences to suit their abilities and desires, while meeting
          Air Force mission and staffing needs.
       •   Provide the means to identify and staff key career program positions Air Force-wide with
           exceptional performers and highly qualified employees.
       •   Strive to have career program selections and composition mirror the appropriate civilian labor
           force data.
       •   Assure planned developmental actions (e.g. training, career broadening assignments, educa-
           tion, etc.) are related to performance and knowledge, skill, and ability (KSA) requirements
           necessary to successfully perform in career program covered positions.

2. Structure. Functional management, with civilian personnel oversight, will design the program and its
operation.
   2.1. Career Program Policy Councils. Career program policy and direction will emanate from
   functional management through policy councils, which will normally meet at least annually. HQ
   USAF/DPC will establish regulatory policies and guidelines, and each council will direct the develop-
   ment of its program to address unique functional needs. Council composition will represent various
   functional disciplines and specialties within the functional community and will include female and
   minority representatives at appropriate grade level and background, as available. The councils will
   foster and support equal employment opportunity (EEO). The functional chief may alter the compo-
   sition of the council, but membership will typically include:
        • The functional chief as policy council chairperson.
        • A senior military functional manager (typically brigadier general or above).
        • A senior civilian in the functional area at Air Staff or secretariat level.
        • Director, Civilian Personnel Policy and Personnel Plans (HQ USAF/DPC), or designee.
        • A senior functional specialist from each of three major commands (MAJCOM) or comparable
           organizations (designation of MAJCOM is made by the functional chief usually on a 2-year
           rotational basis).
        • Chief, Career Management Division, Air Force Civilian Personnel Management Center (HQ
           AFCPMC/DPC) (nonvoting, ex-officio technical advisor).
        • Air Force Civilian Policy Division (HQ USAF/DPCC) representative (nonvoting, policy
           observer).
        • Career program manager, i.e. PALACE team chief (nonvoting, executive secretary).
   2.2. Career Management Teams. A career management team, or PALACE team, which includes
   one or more functional and personnel representatives, manages each career program. Personnel spe-
   cialists serve as experts on the requirements of law and guidance, while functional specialists repre-
   sent the needs of the functional community and serve as communication links with functional
   managers. A functional specialist serves as the career program manager (PALACE team chief).
   2.3. Centrally Managed Positions. Functional management determines the scope of program opera-
   tions and determines which positions are covered by the career program. Career program positions,
   including career broadening positions, are managed by career program Policy Councils and PALACE
   teams, to include filling vacancies through career program referrals. Career program functionals
   also centrally manage intern positions, which represent planned force renewal efforts. Each career
   program establishes and distributes specific criteria, outlining the position categories, grade levels,
   etc., to be covered. (See specific career program chapters in AFMAN 36-606.)

                                                2
   2.4. Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS). The DCPDS supports the entire personnel
   life cycle of each Air Force employee to include: recruitment, appointment, training, utilization, sus-
   tainment, and separation or retirement. Career programs will use the DCPDS to identify and screen
   candidates for referral consideration. The Promotion and Placement Referral Subsystem (PPRS) uses
   DCPDS records to identify employees eligible for referral and then ranks them for promotion, reas-
   signment, or change-to-lower-grade consideration.
