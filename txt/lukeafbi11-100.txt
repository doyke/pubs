                                       INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose and Need for G-performance Risk Management. The F-16 aircraft operated by
Luke AFB student pilots are easily capable of causing G-induced loss of consciousness (G-
LOC). An effective anti-G straining maneuver (AGSM), optimum physical conditioning,
functioning anti-G equipment and adequate G-oriented situational awareness are all important to
aircrew G-performance. Early detection of G-performance risk indicators can aid in the
establishment of tailored ground training programs designed to optimize a student’s performance
under G.
   1.1.1. GRIM consists of initial assessment of a student’s previous high-G-performance and
   present physical condition at the start of F-16 basic course ground training and assessment of
   student’s performance under G while flying the F-16. Observations from these assessments
   are used to qualitatively determine the level of risk for the student and, if necessary, assist in
   development of tailored training programs for the student’s specific needs.
   1.1.2. The purpose of GRIM is to optimize combat capability and safety through the
   following methods:
       1.1.2.1. Identify aircrew with a propensity towards poor G-performance prior to
       conversion training phase.
       1.1.2.2. Assist these aircrew in the development of habit patterns and lifestyle
       decisions/management that will optimize their G-performance throughout the B course
       and beyond.
       1.1.2.3. If students in TX or SOC courses demonstrate problems with G-performance
       while at Luke, GRIM program definitions, courses of action and control measures may be
       utilized at the discretion of FS CC/DO. However, these students need not be officially on
       GRIM nor follow the precise flow of the GRIM program as intended for B-course
       students.
1.2. Explanation of Terms:
   1.2.1. Anti-G Straining Maneuver. Sustained lower body muscle tensing/straining and short
   air exchanges against a closed glottis in 3-second cycles.
   1.2.2. G. Any force that produces an acceleration of 32.2 feet per second, which is
   equivalent to the acceleration produced by earth’s gravity.
   1.2.3. G-tolerance. The ability or capacity to maintain vision, consciousness, and effective
   performance when under G-stress.
   1.2.4. G-endurance. The ability to sustain G for the period of time required by the flying
   scenario.
   1.2.5. Inadequate G-performance. Any G-related incident to include greyout, blackout, or
   inadequate AGSM mechanics (as determined by IP/AP/FS) that result in a failure to meet
   training objectives or requires modification of the usual G profiles associated with any flying
   activity.

    1.2.6. Light Loss. Any peripheral light loss or general vision loss experienced under G
    which adversely impacts mission accomplishment and/or causes deviation from the
    prescribed maneuver or mission profile (i.e., Terminate or KIO). NOTE: Instructor pilot
    and commander judgment will determine what constitutes a significant impact to the mission.
    It is important to recognize that transient peripheral vision loss that is easily recovered by
    either appropriate reduction of G loading or by increased intensity of the AGSM are a normal
    part of flight in the high-G arena and should not be confused with a light loss incident.
    1.2.7. Blackout. Complete vision loss experienced under G, but not accompanied by
    subsequent loss of consciousness.
    1.2.8. GLOC. The transition from normal consciousness to a state of unconsciousness that
    results when blood flow to the nervous system under G is reduced below critical levels to
    support conscious function. GLOC symptoms include: loss of consciousness followed by
    myoclonic convulsive activity (muscle twitching), confusion, disorientation and memory
    loss. After a GLOC the average total incapacitation period is 24 seconds.

  GRIM RISK CONTROL INDICATIONS, PROCEDURES AND ADMINISTRATION

2.1. Overview. Many variables come into play in maximizing G-performance and in preventing
GLOC. Although the individual aviator is ultimately responsible for his or her mental and
physical condition, there are sources of information available to supervisors that may reveal a
student’s predisposition for poor G-performance in the F-16. The following paragraphs describe
some of these risk indicators and the preferred procedures and protocols for their control or
elimination.
   2.1.1. Records Review: A thorough review of training records can reveal trends that may
   indicate poor G-performance.
       2.1.1.1. Flight commanders or 56 TRS AP will check for problems with AGSM and G-
       tolerance by reviewing the IFF grade book and previous acceleration qualification
       training report AF Form 4293. (Should the AF Form 4293 not be in the student’s IFF
       grade book, 56 TRS AP will contact the Brooks centrifuge).
       2.1.1.2. The 56 TRS AP will document findings of significance in the GRIM spreadsheet
       database and provide GRIM recommendations to the FCM, Sq CC/DO and FS during the
       initial B-Course screening committee meeting (See Attachment 2). Based upon inputs
       from the FCM, AP & FS, the flying Sq CC/DO will make the final determination that a
       student be placed on the GRIM program. Flt CCs may use attachment 6 as a reference to
       document student placement on GRIM.
       2.1.1.3. Implement appropriate risk control if necessary (See Chapter 3).
   2.1.2. Fighter Aircrew Conditioning Program Assessment (FACPA):
       2.1.2.1. Assess all B-Course students prior to start fly date.
       2.1.2.2. 56 TRS AP will administer and assess FACPA results.
       2.1.2.3. Summary of results will be documented in the GRIM spreadsheet database.
       FACPA results will be noted on GRIM spreadsheet and those students exhibiting
       marginal physical abilities will be highlighted for discussion at the flying screening
       committee meeting and/or brought to the attention of the flying Sq CC/DO.
       2.1.2.4. Implement appropriate risk control if necessary (See Chapter 3).
   2.1.3. Centrifuge Video Review. The 56 TRS AP can request a centrifuge video review
   from the Brooks centrifuge for students demonstrating problems in any of the previously
   mentioned areas.
2.2. Inadequate G-performance resulting in significant mission impact:
   2.2.1. Squadron AFE will check the student’s equipment and report any malfunctions to the
   student’s Sq CC/DO.
   2.2.2. Evaluation.
       2.2.2.1. The AP and/or FS will review HUD video and will interview student and IP.

        2.2.2.2. Student is immediately referred to Flight Medicine Clinic if not met at the
        aircraft for physical examination and evaluation by FS. Results will be briefed to Sq
        CC/DO & AP.
        2.2.2.3. Implement appropriate risk control (GRIM) if necessary (See Chapter 3)
        Consider placement on GRIM.
        2.2.2.4. No physiological safety report is required. The FS or AP will complete an
        incident report and distribute to Sq CC/DO/Flt CC and 56 FW/SE as well as the other OG
        Flt Surgeons for review.
        2.2.2.5. Student will fly dual on the next sortie and shall continue normal syllabus
        directed training if no further problems are encountered. Consider maintaining student on
        GRIM.
2.3. GLOC (Incapacitation):
     2.3.1. Squadron AFE will check student’s equipment using protocols described in AETCI
     11-301 Section 1F. Report any malfunctions to student’s Sq CC/DO.
     2.3.2. Evaluation.
        2.3.2.1. Student is restricted to dual only flying until cleared by Sq CC/DO to resume
        normal syllabus directed training.
        2.3.2.2. The AP or FS will review HUD video and will interview student and IP.
        2.3.2.3. Student is referred to Flight Medicine Clinic for physical examination.
            2.3.2.3.1. FS and/or AP will coordinate with flight safety for AFSAS/Physiological
            Incident Report, IAW AFI 48-123 and AFI 91-204.
            2.3.2.3.2. If a medical condition is suspected to be diminishing the student’s G-
            tolerance or G-endurance, a medical waiver will be required for continued flying
            duties IAW AFI 48-123 and AFI 11-404.
        2.3.2.4. If necessary, AP can conduct a physical training test to quantify any suspected
        physical performance weaknesses.
        2.3.2.5. Student’s high-G performance and options for risk control will be evaluated
        jointly by the AP, FS, Flt CC, and the Sq CC/DO.
     2.3.3. Implement appropriate risk control/GRIM if necessary (see Chapter 3). If the flying
     Sq CC chooses to utilize CDAT, AP will help the flying Sq schedule the training with the
     Brooks centrifuge.
     2.3.4. The Physiologist conducting the CDAT shall forward the report and recommendation
     to the flying Sq CC/DO, Flt CC 56 AMDS and 56 TRS AP. If student passes CDAT, resume
     normal training. Consider placement on GRIM program for remainder of BFM phase.
2.4. Centrifuge failure or persistently inadequate G-performance: With recommendation of
the flying Sq CC, student will be considered for removal from the F-16 flying training program
and considered for a low-G weapon system training program.
2.5. Administration.
LUKEAFBI11-100 18 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                7


   2.5.1. Following each GRIM monitored training event (see attachment 5), a write-up shall be
   made referencing the evaluation of the pilot’s HUD video review and AGSM/fitness issues
   (GTIMS/TR-x or BFM-x/documents/gradesheet reviews). Additionally, the AP and/or FS
   shall annotate when the next review is required, as occasionally a review may be warranted
   prior to the next scheduled GRIM review.
   2.5.2. Reasonable efforts will be made to review the prescribed GRIM sortie prior to the
   next flight; however, this is not required.
   2.5.3. In the event that a HUD video is not captured due to mechanical malfunctions or other
   reasons, the next available sortie can stand as a suitable substitute for GRIM review.
   2.5.4. The AP and FSs shall be granted access to the GTIMS system.
2.6. Removal from GRIM supervision.
   2.6.1. GRIM supervision will normally expire after BFM phase. However, if during the
   final BFM review, the AP or FS note significant AGSM flaws, a recommendation can be
   made to review additional syllabus sorties for AGSM mechanics. Once the AGSM is noted
   as satisfactory, the student can be removed from GRIM.
   2.6.2. Flt CC will generate a removal from GRIM letter upon recommendation from 56 TRS
   AP or FS.
   2.6.3. In order to facilitate continuity with gaining units, the AP may notify gaining unit DOs
   via email or phone of any students that struggled with G performance or were on GRIM
   status during B course.

                              GRIM RISK CONTROL OPTIONS

3.1. Potential Options. Risk control options include but are not limited to AGSM technique
employment coaching, HUD reviews, PCP, CDAT, and elimination from formal training.
3.2. Monitored Physical Conditioning Program (PCP):
     3.2.1. Purpose: Optimize G tolerance and endurance through a specialized PCP.
     3.2.2. Indicators:
        3.2.2.1. Inadequate strength and/or endurance noted as a problem area during CAF
        qualification centrifuge training, CDAT failure or the 56 TRS AP. NOTE: If physical
        conditioning is deemed a significant limiting factor following centrifuge training or by 56
        TRS AP, temporary removal from flying training may be necessary to allow sufficient
        time to improve the weakness. See AFI 11-404 for more details on CDAT.
     3.2.3. Control Decision: Students who have demonstrated inadequate strength and/or
     endurance indicators of potential risk shall be considered by FCM (after consultation with
     AP or FS) for placement in GRIM for PCP until out of air-to-air flying training phase or until
     strength and endurance are deemed adequate for required performance under G. There are
     no pass/fail criteria for the FACPA. Discretion is left to the 56 TRS AP for
     recommendations on inadequate strength/endurance and potential utility of a monitored PCP
     for the student.
     3.2.4. Control Implementation: Specialized/Personalized PCP.
        3.2.4.1. Will be developed through consultation between student and AP or FS. The
        program will be designed to improve leg/core muscular strength/endurance. It may be
        tailored to meet the unique needs of the student.
        3.2.4.2. Per AETCI 11-406, all students must accomplish and document (in
        GTIMS/additional syllabus requirements) at least 3 physical training sessions per week.
        Emphasis must be given to activities promoting good G performance.
3.3. AGSM Technique Employment Coaching/HUD Review:
     3.3.1. Purpose: Decreases cognitive burden of performing the AGSM during mentally
     intense high-G flight maneuvers. Indicators: Inconsistent or inefficient AGSM mechanics
     noted as problem area during CAF qualification centrifuge training, IFF grade sheets and/or
     HUD review.
     3.3.2. Control Decision: Students who have demonstrated an inconsistent or inefficient
     AGSM shall be considered by the FCM, AP or FS for counseling, coaching and GRIM.
     3.3.3. Control Implementation: Counseling will include but not be limited to discussion on:
        3.3.3.1. Practicing AGSM technique during chair flying and simulator training to make it
        a very natural part of the student’s stick and rudder flying skills/habit patterns.
LUKEAFBI11-100 18 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                             9


      3.3.3.2. HUD AGSM reviews of TR-1, BFM-1, BFM-5, BFM-7, and BFM-9 (optional)
      are required for GRIM. Any other sortie deemed necessary by the squadron leadership,
      AP or FS will also be reviewed. (See Attachment 5)
      3.3.3.3. Development of efficient and consistent AGSM mechanics and application.
      3.3.3.4. Stress management strategies.
3.4. Commander Directed Acceleration Training (CDAT):
   3.4.1. Purpose: CDAT is a tool that can be used by any flying Sq CC to evaluate and
   improve pilot performance under G. It can be used as a remedial tool for any degree of G-
   related problems.
   3.4.2. Indicators: All the risk indicators outlined in chapter 2 of this instruction will be
   considered.
   3.4.3. Control Decision: Upon HUD review by Flt CC, FS, or AP, the flying Sq CC can
   direct CDAT.
   3.4.4. Control Implementation: Scheduling CDAT: Brooks City Base centrifuge is the point
   of contact for scheduling CDAT. The flying squadron or the AP can contact Brooks at 210-
   382-8719.
      3.4.4.1. Duration of training is normally three days.
      3.4.4.2. See AFI 11-404 for more details on CDAT.
3.5. Elimination from Training:
   3.5.1. Purpose: Limits the student’s exposure to the risks of high-G flight by removing him
   or her from F-16 training with potential redirection to a lower-G aircraft.
   3.5.2. Indicators: CDAT failure, persistent inadequate G-performance or any of the risk
   indicators outlined in Chapter 2 of this instruction will be considered.
   3.5.3. Control Decision: With recommendation from the flying Sq CC, 56 TRS AP and FS,
   the student will be considered for removal from the F-16 flying training program.
   3.5.4. The flying Sq CC/DO will notify the 56 OG CC and 56 TRS DO immediately upon
   suspected elimination of a student in a formal training course.
   3.5.5. Control Implementation: Refer to AETC Syllabus F16C0B00PL and AFI 11-402,
   AETC Sup 1 for administrative procedures on elimination.

enhance G-performance.

2. Lt Day’s attitude and work ethic up to this point are outstanding.

3. Capt Pail (B-Flight CC) counseled Lt Day on DATE.

4. Lt Day should accomplish the following training (Annotated in GTIMS):

  Monitored PCP (If required per 3.2) (AP/FS/Flt CC)
  Preflight G-performance counseling (Conducted by AP/FS during L100 academics)
  TR-1 AGSM HUD video review (AP or FS. Annotate in GTIMS)

                          GTIMS ADMINISTRATION EXAMPLES

Figure A7.1. GTIMS Administration Examples.
Per 11-100 GRIM program requirements I reviewed Capt X’s AGSM technique on BFM-9. He
was present for the review and was debriefed.
Gx/G Awareness:
4.7 G, 6.5 G. All AGSM mech correct.
Butterfly Set:
7.9 G. Good prep breath, little early on 1st air exchange. All other AGSM was correct. Air
exchanges could be slightly shorter/crisper, a trend this ride and from previous GRIM reviews.
Butterfly Set:
7.5 G. Good prep breath. Little early on 1st air exchange, habitually not quite making it to 3 sec
mark. 1st air exchange a little too large, would like to see shorter/crisper. All other AGSM mech
good.
Def Beam Set:
7.3 G. Again, a little early on 1st air exchange. Cadence faster than the 2.5-3 sec standard.
Def Beam Set:
8.6 G. Only required 2 air exchanges during set, all AGSM mech was good.
Overall Assessment/Recommendations:
Capt X demonstrated a safe and seemingly effective AGSM on BFM-9. Overall, his AGSM is
safe and mostly correct. Things to work on: ensure timing of 1st air exchange is at 3 sec/peak G,
whichever arrives first. Strive to keep air exchanges short/crisp and not move so much air.
Recommend removal from GRIM at this time.
