                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. This Air Force Instruction (AFI) provides policy for operating the C-21 aircraft.
It is an original source document for many areas but, for efficacy, restates information found in
aircraft flight manuals, flight information publications (FLIP), and other Air Force directives.
When guidance in this AFI conflicts with another basic/source document, that document takes
precedence. For matters where this AFI is the source document, waiver authority is In
Accordance With (IAW) paragraph 1.4. For matters where this AFI repeats information in
another document, follow waiver authority outlined in the basic/source document.
   1.1.1. Unit commanders and agency directors involved with or supporting C-21 operations
   shall make current copies of this AFI available to appropriate personnel. Transportation and
   Base Operations passenger manifesting agencies will maintain a current copy of this AFI.
1.2. Applicability. This AFI applies to aircrew members, support personnel, contractors, and
managers involved with employing C-21 aircraft.
1.3. Key Words Explained.
   1.3.1. "Will" and "shall" indicate a mandatory requirement.
   1.3.2. "Should" indicates a preferred, but not mandatory, method of accomplishment.
   1.3.3. "May" indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
   1.3.4. "NOTE" indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., considered essential to
   emphasize.
   1.3.5. “CAUTION” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which could result in
   damage to equipment if not carefully followed.
   1.3.6. “WARNING” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which could result in
   personal injury or loss of life if not carefully followed.
1.4. Deviations and Waivers. Do not deviate from policies in this AFI except when the
situation demands immediate action to ensure safety. The Pilot in Command (PIC) is vested
with ultimate mission authority and responsible for each course-of-action they choose to take.
   1.4.1. Deviations. The PIC shall report deviations or exceptions taken without a waiver
   through command channels to their Chief, MAJCOM Stan/Eval who in turn shall notify
   Chief, AMC Stan/Eval (lead command) as appropriate for follow-on action.
   1.4.2. Waivers. Unless otherwise directed, waiver authority for contents of this instruction is
   the MAJCOM/A3/DO with mission execution authority. For TRANSCOM/AMC operational
   missions under Operational Control (OPCON) of 18 Air Force, 18 AF/CC is the waiver
   authority. For aircrews that change Operational Control (CHOP) to a COCOM, the
   COMAFFOR is the waiver authority.
       1.4.2.1. Permanent waivers affect theater unique circumstances and are enduring in
       nature.    List MAJCOM/A3/DO-approved permanent waivers in the MAJCOM
       supplement (see para. 1.5.)

       1.4.2.2. Long-term waivers affect multiple aircraft/multiple missions but are not
       permanent in nature (expire at a specific date/time). MAJCOM Stan/Eval shall send HQ
       AMC Stan/Eval (lead command) copies of MAJCOM/A3/DO-approved long-term
       waivers, as appropriate.
       1.4.2.3. Short-notice waivers are for specific missions in execution. PICs shall use the
       Waiver Protocol procedure in Chapter 4 to secure MAJCOM/A3/DO approval for short-
       notice waivers.
          1.4.2.3.1. USAFE planning/execution agencies may use the waiver protocol to secure
          MAJCOM/A3/DO approval for short-notice waivers.

Office of Assistant Vice Chief of Staff, USAF (CVAM), Unit Command Posts, Air Mobility
Control Centers (AMCC), Contingency Response Groups (CRG), Contingency Response
Elements (CRE), and Special Tactics Teams (STT). C2 centers are action agents for the MAF
commander with execution authority (operational control) over mobility missions/forces.
2.2. Execution Authority. Headquarters commanders with command authority over MAF
resources hold execution authority for directed missions. Commanders with execution authority
formulate plans, allocate assets, and approve PICs to carry out directed or training missions
through a local command post or C2 element. OG/CCs serve as execution authority for local
training missions. Squadron commanders (SQ/CCs) or their designated representatives assign
airlift missions to PICs. PICs hold execution authority for missions operating outside normal
communication channels (use last known mission orders or best course of action).
   2.2.1. Off-Station Trainers (OST).       Refer to MAJCOM instruction, for procedures and
   requirements.
       2.2.1.1. For AMC OSTs, refer to AMCI 11-208, Tanker/Airlift Operations, for
       procedures and requirements governing OSTs.
       2.2.1.2. Approval authority for ANG, PACAF, and USAFE OSTs is the wing
       commander (WG/CC) but may be delegated to the OG/CC.
       2.2.1.3. AFRC Current Operations (AFRC/DOOM) is approval authority for AFRC Unit
       Equipped (UE) OSTs.
       2.2.1.4. DELETED
       2.2.1.5. WG/CC is approval authority for AETC OSTs.
2.3. Pilot in Command Responsibility and Authority. SQ/CCs shall designate an aircraft
commander (AC), instructor pilot (IP), or evaluator pilot (EP) as the PIC for all flights on a flight
authorization form IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and applicable supplements. An
unqualified or non-mission ready pilot may not be designated as PIC. PICs are:
   2.3.1. In command of all persons aboard the aircraft.
   2.3.2. Vested with authority to accomplish the assigned mission. The PIC shall only fly
   events authorized in the mission tasking unless in the PIC‘s judgment an emergency
   condition demands otherwise. Fly unscheduled training events (i.e. transition training) only
   after obtaining approval of the execution authority.
   2.3.3. The final mission authority and will make decisions not assigned to higher authority.
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                   15


   2.3.4. The final authority for requesting or accepting aircrew or mission waivers.
   2.3.5. Responsible for passing mission progress reports (at least daily) to C2 agents.
   2.3.6. Responsible for interaction between aircrew members and mission support personnel
   and will establish a point-of-contact (POC) with the appropriate C2 agent prior to entering
   crew rest. Local C2 agents are responsible for coordinating mission support requirements on
   the PICs behalf.
   2.3.7. Responsible for the welfare of aircrew members, Mission Essential Ground Personnel
   (MEP), passengers, and the safe accomplishment of the mission.
   2.3.8. Responsible for ensuring all passengers are manifested properly.
2.4. Mission Clearance Decision. The execution authority and PIC shall make the mission
clearance decision. In all cases, final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with
the PIC. If a PIC elects to delay a mission, that mission will not depart until the conditions that
generated the decision to delay improve or are resolved. Further, no execution authority may
task another PIC to take the same mission under the same conditions.
   2.4.1. Only re-route or divert a mission when authorized by the execution authority, to
   resolve an emergency, if required due to insufficient fuel or if required by en route or
   terminal weather conditions.
   2.4.2. The agent that directed the re-route or divert shall ensure the aircraft is capable of
   executing departure, en route, and destination arrival procedures.
   2.4.3. The PIC will notify the appropriate C2 agent of any aircraft or aircrew limitation that
   may preclude re-route or divert.
   2.4.4. When a C2 agent directs a PIC to fly to an alternate airfield, the agent will ensure
   existing and forecast weather for the alternate, Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs), and airfield
   information from the Global Decision Support System (GDSS)/(GDSS2)/Airfield Suitability
   and Restrictions Report (ASRR) is suitable. If the alternate becomes unsuitable while en
   route, the PIC will coordinate with the C2 agent for other suitable alternates. The PIC is final
   authority for accepting a suitable alternate. A C2 agent will alert customs and all appropriate
   ground service agencies of the PIC‘s impending arrival.
2.5. Operational C2 Reporting.
   2.5.1. Stations With MAF C2 Agency. Local MAF C2 agents will enter mission data
   (arrival, departure, and advisory messages) in the MAF C2 system.
   2.5.2. Stations Without MAF C2 Agency. Transmit mission data (arrival, departure, and
   advisory messages) to the controlling C2 agency by any means available (preference in the
   following order, DSN. For critical C2 communications, i.e. aircraft waiver request,
   maintenance delay, etc., voice communications are the primary method.
   2.5.3. Enroute Reporting, 618 TACC managed missions only.
       2.5.3.1. Make the following enroute calls to 618 TACC:
           2.5.3.1.1. Airborne call when departing from a location without an AMC presence.
           2.5.3.1.2. Maintenance call whenever aircraft alpha status changes to code 3.

         2.5.3.1.4. Uncoordinated aircraft interceptions via the most expeditious means
         available, after complying with guidance in the flight information handbook. When
         an airborne report is not accomplished, PICs must directly notify 618 TACC upon
         landing. In all cases ensure local C2 and Intel agencies are informed.
     2.5.3.2. CONUS. Periodic ―ops normal‖ calls/transmissions are not required; however,
     the controlling C2 agency may increase reporting requirements.
     2.5.3.3. OCONUS. MAJCOM C2 agencies will specify increased reporting procedures
     through a communications plan in the Operations Plan (OPLAN), Operations Order
     (OPORD), Fragmentary Order (FRAG), Mission Directive, or Flight Publications (FLIP).
     Aircrews will maintain listening watch in accordance with the communications plan
     within aircraft equipment capabilities.
  2.5.4. Aircraft Status/Maintenance Discrepancy Reporting. PICs shall report aircraft system
  malfunctions that traditionally require extensive trouble shooting as soon as feasible.
  Contact arrival C2 agency if available, otherwise contact MAJCOM C2 for relay.
  2.5.5. Not Used
  2.5.6. ―Thirty Minute‖ Out Call. Transmit a UHF or VHF arrival advisory to the destination
  C2 agency approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival. Provide Estimated Time in Blocks
  (ETB).
  2.5.7. 618 TACC Integrated Flight Management (IFM) Sorties. On IFM sorties, the flight
  managers (FM) will be the C2 conduit for aviators. For critical C2 communications, voice
  communications (HF, DSN, etc.) are the primary method. EXCEPTION: For AFRC/ANG
  missions using IFM, AFRC/ANG will provide C2.
     2.5.7.1. Position Reporting on IFM Missions. IFM missions transiting oceanic flight
     information regions (FIRs) need to add the phrase ―Pass to Hilda‖ to ATC position
     reports. Crews may also use the ARINC frequencies listed in the aircrew flimsy for C2
     phone patch requirements. Use ARINC phone patch only after exhausting normal
     communication methods.
  2.5.8. High Frequency (HF) Communications. HF is the primary means of access to the
  worldwide C2 network. See aircrew FIH for stations and appropriate frequency.
     2.5.8.1. During transoceanic flights or at other times when directed by ATC, the HF
     radio shall be set to the ATC frequency.

2.6. Mission Commander (MC).
   2.6.1. Unit commanders shall designate a MC when more than two aircraft are assembled to
   perform missions away from home station. Unit commanders should consider appointing a
   MC for special, high-visibility missions (i.e. CAPSTONE, DV2, etc.). The MC has overall
   responsibility and is the final authority for decisions that impact mission execution. The MC
   shall properly coordinate mission details. For flight-managed sorties, MC shall coordinate
   any special mission planning requirements with the IFM mission allocator not later than 24
   hours prior to mission execution
       2.6.1.1. For MAJCOM-tasked missions, with more than one airlift unit involved, the
       theater AOC shall designate a central planning agency responsible for coordinating the
       entire mission with all involved agencies. The OG/CC for the lead planning agency will
       designate an MC. The MC will be a rated (normally field grade) officer qualified in the
       type mission.
2.7. Not Used.
2.8. C2 Agency Telephone Numbers. Crewmembers may use the 618 TACC toll-free number,
1-800-AIR-MOBL or DSN 312-779-0320 to contact other offices within the 618 TACC,
including flight managers.
2.9. Close Watch Missions. Close Watch missions (for example, Combat Survival and Rescue
(CSAR); Aeromedical Evacuation (AE), PHOENIX BANNERs) receive special C2 attention.
PICs will promptly notify the appropriate C2 agency of delays, aborts, or other events that affect
on-time departure. Provide the C2 agent the estimated time in commission (ETIC), planned
estimated time of departure (ETD), and estimated time of arrival (ETA) within 10 minutes of the
event or as soon as safety allows.
2.10. Law Enforcement Support. It is the policy of the Department of Defense (DoD) to
cooperate with civilian law enforcement officials to the maximum extent practicable and as
permitted by law. AFI 10-801, Assistance to Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies, provides the
policies and procedures service members must follow when supporting federal, state, and local
civilian law enforcement agencies. Coordinate all civilian law enforcement authorities‘ requests
for assistance through appropriate C2 channels.

                       AIRCREW COMPLEMENT/MANAGEMENT

3.1. General. This chapter provides guiding principles to form/manage mobility aircrews.
Commanders at all levels shall follow these policies to form aircrews and to develop aircrew-
related work/rest schedules that optimize efficiency of mobility forces engaged in worldwide
operations.
3.2. Aircrew Complement. SQ/CCs shall form aircrews based on fragmentation order/mission
directive, Crew Duty Time (CDT) and Flight Duty Period (FDP) requirements, aircrew member
qualifications, and other constraints to safely accomplish the mission tasking. Table 3.1. below
summarizes crew position requirements for different crew types.
   3.2.1. The minimum aircrew member complement for a local training flight is an aircraft
   commander and a pilot/copilot.

3.3. Aircrew Member Qualification. An aircrew member will be qualified, or in qualification
training, to perform duties as a primary aircrew member.
   3.3.1. Senior leaders who complete a Senior Staff Qualification course (restricted AF Form
   8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification) or orientation for a Senior Staff Familiarization flight
   may occupy a primary crew position when under direct instructor supervision. Refer to AFI
   11-401 for procedures and requirements governing senior leader flying.
   3.3.2. Crewmembers who complete the Senior Staff Course will log ―FP‖ as the Flight
   Authorization Duty Code on the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data
   Document.
   3.3.3. Crewmembers who complete the Senior Officer Familiarization flight will log ―OP‖
   as the Flight Authorization Duty Code on the AFTO Form 781.
3.4. Pilots. An IP must supervise non-current or unqualified pilots regaining currency or
qualification (direct IP supervision during takeoffs, landings and emergency procedures).
   3.4.1. Missions with Passengers. To occupy a pilot‘s seat with passengers, pilots must have
   a current AF Form 8 for the C-21A aircraft. For takeoff, approach and landing one of the
   following conditions must be met:
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                               19


       3.4.1.1. Two qualified and current pilots (1 AC or higher, 1 FP or higher) must be at the
       controls.
       3.4.1.2. A qualified pilot non-current no more than 60 days for flying currency
       requirements and an IP providing direct supervision (must be at the controls). AC‘s
       regaining currency may be designated PIC.
       3.4.1.3. A qualified NMR pilot accomplishing phase II qualification training and an IP
       providing direct supervision.
       3.4.1.4. A qualified AC upgrade candidate on an initial or requalification OME and a
       qualified pilot (FP or higher) under supervision of a qualified EP must be at the controls
       (AC upgrade candidates will be designated in command).
       3.4.1.5. A basic qualified (valid AF Form 8 in MDS-specific aircraft) senior officer who
       has completed a Senior Officer Qualification course may occupy either pilot seat under
       direct IP supervision.
   3.4.2. Qualification Training. Initial qualification, requalification, or upgrade training (AC
   upgrade training allowed) for pilots will not be conducted on missions with passengers
   onboard. Mission qualification training, OMEs, and line training/development missions may
   be conducted on missions with passengers onboard only if the individual in training is
   qualified to the applicable level.
   3.4.3. Local Training and Evaluation Missions. Non-current or unqualified pilots may
   perform crew duties under the supervision of a qualified instructor or examiner. If
   passengers are carried, paragraph 3.4.1. of this AFI applies.
3.5. Not used.
3.6. Not used.
3.7. Aircrew Management. SQ/CCs and en route C2 agents shall ensure work/rest cycles
permit an aircrew adequate time to safely accomplish mission duties and personal time for rest.
   3.7.1. Flight Duty Period (FDP). FDP is the period of time starting at mission report time
   and ending immediately after the aircrew completes the final engine shutdown of the day.
   SQ/CCs shall form aircrews based on worst-case FDP in the mission directive. Reduce FDP
   when the autopilot fails after departure IAW information below. If the autopilot fails after
   departure, consider mission requirements and determine the best course of action to preclude
   further mission delays due to reduced FDP. The best course of action may include diverting
   to an airfield with maintenance capability. Contact C2, coordinate intentions, and comply
   with limitations.
       3.7.1.1. Basic Crew FDP. The maximum FDP for a basic aircrew is 14 hours (12 hours
       when the autopilot is inoperative).
          3.7.1.1.1. A PIC with a basic crew may seek MAJCOM/A3/DO (mission execution
          authority) approval to extend the FDP as much as 2 hours to complete a scheduled
          mission. Only use this provision to recover from unscheduled/unplanned en route
          delays. C2 agents shall not ask a PIC to exercise this option.
       3.7.1.2. Not used.

     3.7.1.3. Not used.
     3.7.1.4. Not used.
     3.7.1.5. Training, Tactical, and Functional Check Flights/Acceptance Check Flights
     (FCFs/ACFs) FDP:
         3.7.1.5.1. Maximum FDP for training, tactical, and FCF/ACF missions is 14 hours
         (12 hours when the autopilot is inoperative). Conduct the mission as follows:
         3.7.1.5.2. Complete all mission-related events (i.e., FCF/ACF checks, transition
         events, or tactical events for training) during the first 12 hours of the FDP.
            3.7.1.5.2.1. Crew duty time (CDT) and FDP include both military duty and
            civilian work. CDT and FDP begin when an individual reports for their first duty
            period (military or civilian).
         3.7.1.5.3. Crews may fly/deposition to home station, next location, or a deployed
         staging base following training (do not exceed 12 hours when the autopilot is
         inoperative).
  3.7.2. Crew Duty Time (CDT). CDT is that period of time an aircrew may perform
  combined ground/flight duties. Plan the mission so aircrew members may complete post-
  mission duties within maximum CDT. An aircrew member may perform mission-related
  duties for other missions when approved by member‘s home station SQ/CC or equivalent.
  Maximum CDT for a basic aircrew is 16 hours.
  3.7.3. Except as outlined below, CDT/FDP begins 1 hour after aircrew alert notification.
  SQ/CC or equivalent may task aircrew members to perform other duties before they begin
  flight-related duties or MAJCOM/A3/DO may authorize a C2 agent to alert an aircrew
  member early. Begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for those duties.
     3.7.3.1. For self-alerts, the PIC shall coordinate early individual/crew mission report
     times with C2 agents. Begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for duty.
     3.7.3.2. CDT/FDP Extensions. See AFI 11-202V3.
  3.7.4. Mission Essential Personnel (MEP) Time. IAW AFI 11-401 MAF aircrew members
  may travel as additional crewmembers (not required for the mission being flown but required
  for follow-on missions) as MEP. MEP will not be listed on the AFTO Form 781, will not log
  time, and will not accrue OFDA credit. Crewmembers may travel as MEP for a maximum of
  24 hours. OG/CC or equivalent may approve crewmembers to travel as MEP in excess of 24
  hours.
     3.7.4.1. Current/qualified aircrew members may perform primary aircrew duties after
     flying in deadhead status provided they do not exceed a basic FDP (FDP starts at report
     time for deadhead flight).
     3.7.4.2. Aircrew members may travel in MEP status after performing primary crew
     duties, for a maximum of 24 hours from the time the crewmember‘s FDP began.
  3.7.5. Aircrew Member Support of Aircraft Generation Activities (Pre-flight, cargo up-/off-
  load, start, and taxi aircraft). Crew rest is required IAW AFI 11-202V3. The duty day
  begins when the aircrew member reports for official duties.
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                            21


3.8. Scheduling Restrictions. IAW AFI 11-202V3. In addition, SQ/CCs shall not schedule an
aircrew member to fly nor will an aircrew member perform aircrew duties:
   3.8.1. When the flight will exceed maximum flying time limitations of AFI 11-202V3.
   3.8.2. Within 12 hours of consuming alcoholic beverages (based on scheduled takeoff, or
   ALFA standby force legal for alert time, or earliest show time from BRAVO alert) or while
   impaired by its after effects.
   3.8.3. When using nasal sprays to treat symptoms of head congestion existing before flight.
   An aircrew member may use oxymetazoline or phenylephrine nasal sprays as ―get-me-
   downs‖ following an unexpected ear or sinus block during flight. Following use,
   crewmember will be considered DNIF until cleared by a flight surgeon.
3.9. Fatigue Countermeasures Management Program.
   3.9.1. AMC/A3 will establish policy for implementation of the Fatigue Countermeasures
   (CM) Management Program and ensure compliance with its provisions, and AMC/SG will
   provide clinical oversight, guidance and materials for fatigue CM education and mitigation.
   3.9.2. OG/CCs will ensure Unit Operational Risk Management (ORM) programs include use
   of the basic fatigue countermeasures found in the AvORM worksheet. Both the manual and
   automated ―MAF Mission Aviation ORM Worksheet‖ incorporate a fatigue CM risk
   assessment model. They are available on the AMC/A3V website under the ―Pubs‖ tab,
   ―Operational Risk Management (ORM)‖ section, and will be used by all three tiers of
   mission planners, as well as aircrew during the mission execution phase.
   3.9.3. Flight surgeons will use the AMC-approved (lead command) fatigue CM training CDs
   and pamphlets provided by AMC/SGP to educate their operational fliers in venues such as
   clinic visits, flight physicals, Safety Down Days, pre-deployment briefings, readiness
   training, Commanders' Calls, First-Term Airmen Courses, base orientations and safety
   meetings.
   3.9.4. The primary fatigue CM available to aircrew members is appropriate management of
   their sleep/rest cycles. Secondary CM include smart scheduling procedures aimed at
   managing those cycles, strategic inflight and/or ground napping techniques, and proper diet
   and exercise.
   3.9.5. An additional fatigue CM tool available to aircrew is the No-Go Pill. The occasional
   use of a No-Go Pill by MAF aircrew to improve sleep quality and/or adjust circadian rhythm
   sleep/wake cycles is voluntary. Each individual aircrew member will, with the aid of their
   home station flight surgeon, determine how/if to implement the use of No-Go Pills as a
   fatigue CM.
   3.9.6. The following directives concerning the use of No-Go Pills are as important and
   unbreakable as the ―12 hour bottle to throttle‖ restriction for alcohol consumption:
      3.9.6.1. Aircrew members on flight orders will not use No-Go Pills in flight.
      3.9.6.2. Aircrew members will complete ground testing for any No-Go Pill they wish to
      use for operational purposes and document using MAF No-Go Pill Form 1, Ground
      Testing of No-Go Pills. In order to avoid possible drug interactions, aircrew members
      will inform the flight surgeon of any over-the-counter medications and/or nutritional
22                                                  AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


     supplements they are taking. During ground testing, aircrew members will be DNIF on
     an AF Form 1042 for the minimum ‗DNIF‘ periods prescribed in paragraph 3.9.6.4.
     below. After ground testing of a particular No-Go Pill, the flight surgeon will complete
     the bottom half of the Form 1 and a ―return to fly‖ AF Form 1042. Successful ground
     testing of a particular No-Go Pill establishes clearance to use it operationally.
     3.9.6.3. Aircrew members may obtain NoGo Pills from any USAF or other authorized
     flight surgeon while at home station or off-station while TDY/deployed. Off-
     station/deployed flight surgeons can verify individual aircrew ground testing results via
     the ―MAF Aircrew Medication Ground Test Card‖ all MAF aircrew members are
     required to carry.
     3.9.6.4. In no case will an individual perform aircrew duties while under the effects of
     No-Go Pills. Individuals will use the mission report or legal for alert time to determine
     the latest time to take a No-Go Pill. The following are the minimum ‗DNIF‘ periods (no
     AF Form 1042 required) after consuming a No-Go Pill:
        3.9.6.4.1. Sonata (Zaleplon) – 4 hours minimum ‗DNIF‘
        3.9.6.4.2. Ambien (Zolpidem) – 6 hours minimum ‗DNIF‘
        3.9.6.4.3. Restoril (Temazepam, Class IV Controlled Substance) – 12 hours
        minimum ‗DNIF‘ NOTE: No-Go medications can affect individuals very
        differently. To comply with the ―no aircrew duties while under the effects‖
        restriction, it is the responsibility of each individual aircrew member to be aware of
        their own minimum ‗DNIF‘ period for any No-Go Pill they use, based on their
        ground trial results and/or previous experiences.
     3.9.6.5. Aircrew members will consider the following examples of missions prone to
     causing fatigue and/or sleep disruptions in their decision to use a No-Go Pill:
        3.9.6.5.1. Home station night launch missions with 2000-0530L show times and
        greater than four hours‘ duration.
        3.9.6.5.2. Crew rest facilities lacking an optimal (i.e., quiet, air-conditioned,
        darkened) sleeping environment.
        3.9.6.5.3. Off-station missions that are four or more time zones from home station.
        3.9.6.5.4. Rotating or stair-stepped flying schedules with greater than 6-hour flight
        time duration.
        3.9.6.5.5. Missions that run consistently near a 12 to 14 hour duty day.
     3.9.6.6. The MAF‘s worldwide mobility mission makes accountability for this program
     challenging; therefore, the following are aircrew member responsibilities:
        3.9.6.6.1. Aircrew members will not operate heavy equipment during the minimum
        ‗DNIF‘ period for each No-Go Pill outlined in paragraph 3.9.6.4. above.
        3.9.6.6.2. Aircrew members will not take No-Go Pills within 12 hours of consuming
        alcohol, as their combined use unpredictably increases the effects of both.
        3.9.6.6.3. Aircrew members will limit use of Ambien (Zolpidem) and Restoril
        (Temazepam) to a maximum of seven consecutive days and no more than 20 days in
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                             23


         a 60-day period. Flight surgeons should prescribe 60 days‘ worth of medication (20
         pills) at a time if requested by the aircrew member, unless clinically inadvisable.
         3.9.6.6.4. Aircrew members will limit use of Sonata (Zaleplon) to a maximum of 10
         consecutive days and no more than 28 days in a 60-day period. Flight surgeons
         should prescribe 60 days‘ worth of medication (28 pills) if requested by the aircrew
         member, unless clinically inadvisable.
         3.9.6.6.5. If an aircrew member uses Sonata in combination with either of the other
         types of No-Go Pills, the seven consecutive days and 20-days in a 60 day period
         restrictions apply (overrides the 10 consecutive days and 28 days in a 60-day period
         for Sonata).
         3.9.6.6.6. Aircrew members may consume more than one No-Go Pill in a 24-hour
         period, if operationally necessary. A second No-Go Pill of the same or different type
         will not be consumed while in the minimum ‗DNIF‘ period for the previous pill.
         3.9.6.6.7. The ―MAF No-Go Pill Usage/Refill Form‖ will be used to document No-
         Go Pill use and refill authorization, and placed in the aircrew member‘s medical
         record. Non-duty station flight surgeons will forward the form to the aircrew
         member‘s home station aerospace medicine clinic to be placed in their medical
         record. Flight surgeons will immediately discuss any concerns about an aircrew
         member‘s use of No-Go Pills with the individual‘s commander if any question of
         misuse arises.
         3.9.6.6.8. Aircrew members on Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) status will
         follow PRP notification procedures if prescribed No-Go Pills.
  3.9.7. The OG/CC shall establish a system to inform the FS when missions fall into any of
  the following categories (may cause sleep disruptions and are therefore candidates for no-go
  medications):
     3.9.7.1. Home station night launch missions greater than four hours duration.
     3.9.7.2. Crew rest facilities lacking an optimal sleeping environment (quiet, air-
     conditioned, and darkened).
     3.9.7.3. Off-station missions that are 4 or more time zones from home station.
     3.9.7.4. Rotating schedules (stair-stepped flying schedules) with greater then 6-hour
     flight time duration.
     3.9.7.5. Missions that run consistently near a 14-hour (or greater) duty day.
  3.9.8. SQ/CC will not schedule crewmembers to fly or perform crew duties within 12 hours
  of consuming no-go Pills (consider Duties Not Including Flying (DNIF)). EXCEPTION:
  Commanders may reduce the 12-hour timeline after consult with a flight surgeon to confirm
  prescribed no-go pills have short duration effect; i.e., 6 hours for Ambien® (zolpidem) and 4
  hours for Sonata® (zalephon). In no case will crewmembers consume a no-go pill on a
  timeline where they would be under the effect of the medication while they perform aircrew
  duties (use mission report or legal for alert time to determine latest time to take no-go
  medication).
  3.9.9. Aircrew member‘s responsibilities:
 24                                                  AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


      3.9.9.1. Aircrew members will complete ground testing for no-go pills and receive flight
      surgeon clearance prior to using no-go pills in the operational environment.
      3.9.9.2. Aircrew members shall not operate equipment within 12-hours after consuming
      a no-go pill unless shorter times are confirmed with a flight surgeon.
      3.9.9.3. Aircrew members shall not take no-go pills within 12 hours of consuming
      alcohol.
      3.9.9.4. Aircrew will inform the FS of any other medications (including nutritional
      supplements and over the counter medications) they are taking so the FS can evaluate
      potential interactions.
      3.9.9.5. Limit use of Restoril® and Ambien® to a maximum of seven consecutive days
      and no more than 20 days in a 60-day period.
      3.9.9.6. Limit use of Sonata® to a maximum of 10 consecutive days and no more than
      28 days in a 60-day period.
3.10. Crew Rest/En route Ground Time. OG/CCs shall establish procedures to place
crewmembers in crew rest. MAJCOM/A3/DO may waive any portion of the crew rest period or
ground time as needed to meet mission tasking.
   3.10.1. Home-Station Pre-departure Crew Rest. For missions that will keep aircrew
   members off station 16 hours or more, unit commanders will enter primary and deadhead
   aircrew members into pre-departure crew rest 24 hours before the legal for alert time.
   Aircrew members may perform limited non-flying duties like mission planning during the
   first 12 hours of pre-departure crew rest. OG/CCs may waive any portion of the first 12
   hours of pre-departure crew rest. Do not manifest deadhead aircrew members as passengers
   to deny pre-departure crew rest. EXCEPTION: ANG and AETC in accordance with AFI
   11-202V3 and appropriate supplement.
   3.10.2. Off-station/En route Crew Rest. The minimum en route crew rest period is 12 hours
   before legal for alert or scheduled report time when self-alerting.
      3.10.2.1. Except during emergencies or as authorized by MAJCOM/A3/DO, C2 agents
      shall not disturb an aircrew member in crew rest. When necessary to interrupt aircrew
      members‘ crew rest period, re-enter that aircrew in a subsequent minimum 12 hour crew
      rest period after they complete official duties.
      3.10.2.2. Do not enter aircrew members into crew rest until they complete official post-
      flight duties. Those duties may include, but are not limited to, refueling, cargo on-/off-
      load, aircrew arming, minor maintenance, or mission debriefing.
   3.10.3. Off-station/En route Ground Time. Mobility planners and C2 agents shall provide
   aircrews at least 16 hours ground time between engine shutdown and subsequent takeoff.
      3.10.3.1. Mission planners, PICs, or C2 agents may modify ground time as follows:
          3.10.3.1.1. In the interest of safety.
          3.10.3.1.2. To start (mission reporting time) no earlier than 12 hours from the time
          the aircrew entered crew rest. Before reducing ground time, PICs will consider time
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                            25


         to complete mission planning, cargo on-/off-load, and non-standard mission related
         duties. C2 agents will not ask PICs to accept less than 16 hours ground time.
     3.10.3.2. Mobility planners should construct mission itineraries with en route ground
     times longer than 16 hours to afford aircrew members opportunities to recover from the
     cumulative affects of fatigue caused by flying on several consecutive days or due to
     transiting several time zones. If practical, make the en route ground time 36 hours
     (maximum) after three consecutive near maximum FDPs.
  3.10.4. Crew Enhancement Crew Rest (CECR). CECR is not an alternative to a safety-of-
  flight delay but provides PICs a means to minimize the adverse effects of a crew alert and
  report period outside normal duty time. CECR periods should be of minimum duration and
  are normally used during de-positioning legs. Tasking authorities shall approve PIC requests
  to delay alert time to normalize the work-rest cycle or increase messing options when
  mission allows. When requests are disapproved, the C2 agent will inform the PIC of the
  reason for disapproval.
  3.10.5. Post-Mission Crew Rest (PMCR). SQ/CCs shall give aircrew members returning to
  home base sufficient time to recover from cumulative effects of the mission and tend to
  personal needs. PMCR begins upon mission termination. (NA to ANG and AETC).
     3.10.5.1. For missions that keep an aircrew off station 16 or more hours, the SQ/CC shall
     provide 1 hour (up to 96 hours) PMCR for each 3 hours off-station. Do not enter aircrew
     members in pre-departure crew rest until the PMCR period expires.
     3.10.5.2. PMCR is not applicable to continuing missions and MAJCOM/A3/DO may
     suspend PMCR during contingency operations.
     3.10.5.3. OG/CCs (or equivalents) are PMCR waiver authority.
  3.10.6. Not used.
  3.10.7. The lead USAF component will publish MAJCOM/A3/DO-approved crew rest
  criteria in the Exercise or Contingency Operation Order (OPORD), Operation Plan (OPLAN)
  or Concept of Operations (CONOPs).
  3.10.8. The Prime Knight program streamlines the process of getting aircrews from aircraft
  parking ramp into lodging/crew rest. It is only successful when billeting agents receive
  accurate aircrew/mission information in a timely manner.
     3.10.8.1. C2 Agent Responsibilities. A MAJCOM C2 agent will forward information on
     the departing aircrew‘s orders to a POC for the next crew rest location‘s Prime Knight
     function.
     3.10.8.2. PIC Responsibilities. If departing from a location with a C2 agency, ensure a
     C2 agent has accurate aircrew/mission information to forward to the next Prime Knight
     POC. If departing from a facility without a C2 agency, the PIC will call the next crew
     rest location Prime Knight POC to pass aircrew/mission information.
     3.10.8.3. SQ/CC or designated authenticating official shall ensure TDY/Flight orders
     clearly indicate the unit fund cite so that the PIC may make Prime Knight reservations in
     advance. Without a unit fund cite on the TDY/Flight orders, the PIC must make advance
     reservations using a government travel card to participate in the Prime Knight program.
 26                                                     AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


3.11. Alerting Procedures. MAJCOM C2 agents shall establish a legal for alert time with the
PIC and when appropriate, the Medical Crew Director (MCD) of Aeromedical Evacuation (AE)
crews. Whenever possible, C2 agents will inform PICs and MCDs of aircraft status, expected
patient up load time, and other pertinent mission details that will streamline mission launch.
   3.11.1. Aircrew alert time is normally 3+00 hours before scheduled takeoff time (allows 1
   hour for reporting and 2+00 hours for mission preparation). Individual locations may
   increase or decrease this time depending on specific capabilities. OG/CCs may establish
   self-alert procedures for local training missions.
       3.11.1.1. For missions with more than minimum ground time, the PIC may arrange an
       alert time that provides additional preparation time to accomplish the mission. The PIC
       may also accept alerting with reduced preparation time when the mission allows. In all
       cases, the PIC shall coordinate changes to standard alerting times with the appropriate C2
       agency.
       3.11.1.2. Not used.
       3.11.1.3. C2 agents shall not alert an aircrew until the aircraft is in commission or there
       is reasonable assurance that maintenance technicians will complete repairs that allow the
       aircrew time to pre-flight and load the aircraft to meet the target takeoff time.
       3.11.1.4. C2 agents shall not alert outbound crews when inbound aircraft is on A-2 or A-
       3 status until maintenance technicians determine required parts are available and the
       aircraft will be repaired within the target ground time.
       3.11.1.5. Self-Alerts. Crews may self-alert at locations without a C2 agency, but must
       coordinate with controlling C2 agency. The PIC may elect to self-alert on operational
       missions at locations with a C2 agency. Coordinate the alert time with local C2 agents to
       avoid FDP limitations that result from unexpected changes in the mission.
   3.11.2. The aircrew release policy is as follows:
       3.11.2.1. On the aircrew‘s initial entry or re-entry into crew rest, the controlling C2
       agent, or PIC during self-alerts, will establish an expected alert time.
       3.11.2.2. For all missions, the latest allowable alert time is 6 hours after the expected
       alert time. The PIC may extend that window to 8 hours when flying as primary crew or
       12 hours when flying in deadhead status. The controlling C2 agent will not ask the PIC
       to accept more than the 6 hour window. ANG/AFRC aircrew members may extend the
       window as necessary to deadhead to home station to meet the Firm Scheduled Return
       Time (FSRT).
       3.11.2.3. When a C2 agent determines circumstances will not allow for aircrew alerting
       during the legal for alert window, at that time but not earlier than the expected alert time,
       the C2 agent will contact the PIC and establish a new expected alert time at least 12 hours
       from the time of notification.
       3.11.2.4. At the end of the legal for alert window or if the mission risk becomes elevated
       and the aircraft commander determines the overall risk of the mission prohibits safe
       continuation, he/she will contact a C2 agent and establish a new expected alert time.
3.12. Stage Management.
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                27


   3.12.1. Stage Posture. Stages operate on a positive launch principle. C2 agents shall alert
   aircrews using the following priority/hierarchy:
       3.12.1.1. Aircrews that require an emergency return to home station.
       3.12.1.2. De-positioning stage crews will be prioritized by their SRTs.
       3.12.1.3. Aircrews in sequence of arrival time.
       3.12.1.4. If the stage manager returns an aircrew in the stage to crew rest because of a
       mission delay or abort, that aircrew becomes first out when legal for alert.
   3.12.2. Mechanical Stage. A C2 agent may create a mechanical stage when a delayed or
   aborted mission will not resume before that aircrew‘s FDP expires. Aircrews in a
   mechanical stage will be first out when a mission in the same direction transits their location
   while they are legal for alert. A C2 agent may bump an inbound aircrew with FDP to
   complete that mission to cycle aircrews in a mechanical stage. C2 agents should not
   normally establish a mechanical stage for ANG and AFRC crews flying unit-equipped
   aircraft.
3.13. Standby Force Duty. MAJCOM C2 Agents shall task units for Standby Force Duty not
later than 18 hours prior to Legal For Alert time. This allows crewmembers 12 hours of pre-
standby crew rest and 6 hours for aircraft pre-flight duty. When aircrews are unable to complete
all preflight duties within 6 hours of crew show time, provide an additional 12-hour pre-standby
crew rest. If MAJCOM C2 agents are unable to provide 18 hours prior notification, SQ/CC shall
place the pre-standby crew in 12 hour crew rest and follow aircraft generation procedures in
paragraph 3.7.5 to prepare the aircraft for launch. SQ/CC may keep an aircrew in
ALFA/BRAVO status up to 48 hours. MAJCOM/A3/DO may extend this period for
contingencies. After completion of an alert period, launch, release, or re-enter aircrew into 12
hour pre-departure crew rest. OG/CCs may provide additional local procedures for management
of Standby Force Duties.
   3.13.1. ALFA Standby Aircraft Preflight Generation and Security. When tasked, SQ/CC
   shall posture an aircraft and aircrew as an ALFA Standby Force able to launch within 1 hour.
   The following procedures apply to primary aircraft as well as spare aircraft generated for
   ALFA alerts. A maintenance Dash -6 and aircrew Dash -1 preflight must be completed.
   Preflight validity will be in accordance with applicable T.O. After the preflight, the PIC will
   notify the controlling agency. The aircraft will remain in a sealed posture and be referred to
   as ―cocked on alert‖. Documentation of when the aircraft was cocked on alert must be
   placed in the forms. The PIC will ensure the aircraft is secure before entering crew rest.
   Secure all hatches and doors to show unauthorized entry. Close and lock the crew entrance
   door with the key, which will prevent entry without damage to the door or lock. The aircrew
   preflight portion remains valid if performed by one crew, cocked on alert, and launched by
   another crew. Uncocking a generated aircraft is not a standard procedure but may be
   accomplished on a case by case basis. The PIC or a designated aircrew representative must
   be present if access to the aircraft is required. Ensure command and control and the
   controlling agency are notified when uncocking and recocking generated aircraft. Follow-on
   pre-flights done during normal waking hours do not interrupt crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP
   when C2 agent directs the aircrew to launch from crew rest or while performing pre-flight
   (begin CDT/FDP when the aircrew arrived at the aircraft to do the pre-flight).
 28                                                    AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


   3.13.2. BRAVO Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture an aircraft and/or
   aircrew in BRAVO Standby Force to permit launch within 2 hours of unit notification.
   Follow-on pre-flights, if required, interrupt crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP when aircrew shows
   for duty.
   3.13.3. CHARLIE Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture aircrews as a
   CHARLIE Standby Force ready to enter crew rest within 2 hours. Tasked aircrews will be
   legal for alert 12 hours after entering crew rest. SQ/CC may keep aircrews in CHARLIE
   status up to 72 hours. After 72 hours, release aircrews from CHARLIE Standby or enter
   them into 12 hours crew rest for directed mission, training mission, or subsequent Standby
   Force duty.
   3.13.4. Wing Standby Force. OG/CC may place aircrews in Wing Standby status. After a
   12 hour pre-departure crew rest period, aircrews are legal for alert for 12 hours and must be
   able to launch within 2 hours of unit notification. After 12 hours, launch, release, or re-enter
   aircrews in 12 hour crew rest period before subsequent 12 hours Wing Standby duty.
   3.13.5. Post-Standby Missions. On completion of standby duty, aircrew members may be
   dispatched on a mission. If started, post-standby crew rest must be completed before the start
   of pre-departure crew rest. If an aircrew member is dispatched on a mission, compute the
   post-mission crew rest time on standby time plus mission time.
   3.13.6. Post Standby Crew Rest. Aircrew members not dispatched on a mission following
   standby duty will receive post-mission standby crew rest as follows:
       3.13.6.1. If standby duty is performed away from normal quarters, crew rest time is
       computed from this standby time on the same basis as for mission time.
       3.13.6.2. If standby duty was performed in normal quarters, no crew rest time is
       authorized.
3.14. Orientation Flights and Incentive Flights. Refer to DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation
Eligibility, AFI 11-401 and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement.
3.15. Interfly. Interfly is a temporary arrangement between OG/CCs or equivalent to permit the
exchange or substitution of aircrew members and/or aircraft between mobility units to
accomplish flying missions. Interfly will be limited to sp0ecific operations, exercises, or special
circumstances. However, it may be used for events of longer duration such as unit conversion to
another model design series (MDS). AFRC/A3 has delegated interfly approval authority to unit
OG/CCs for active duty/ANG interfly with AFRC and AFRC to AFRC interfly. Units utilizing
this authority will inform AFRC/A3V. NGB/A3 has delegated approval authority to Wing
Commanders for active duty/AFRC interfly with ANG, and OG/CC approval authority for ANG
to ANG interfly. ANG units will ensure appropriate active duty General Officer support staff
has notified the Air Force Directorate of Personnel General Officer Management Office
(AF/DPG) prior to any active duty General Officer flying with their unit. EXCEPTION: AE
crewmembers are exempt from interfly requirements. Conduct interfly operations as follows:
   3.15.1. Aircrew members shall be current and qualified in the MDS, as well as unique
   systems or configuration required to fly the aircraft/mission.
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                              29


   3.15.2. Aircrew members will follow operational procedures established by the lead
   command for the MDS. The Mission Commander or PIC will brief MAJCOM-specific
   items.
   3.15.3. Each affected group commander who commits resources (personnel or aircraft) must
   concur with interfly proposal.
   3.15.4. MDS conversion training.
   3.15.4.1. Units may request an interfly agreement for duration of their conversion. OG/CCs
   will forward interfly requests to individual OG/CCs for approval. Requests will include as a
   minimum a list of effected units, duration of the agreement, and purpose.
   3.15.5. NGB/A3 has delegated authority for interfly agreements to the wing commanders for
   active duty and AFRC interfly with ANG units.
3.16. Mission Essential Personnel (MEP). Procedures and policies regarding MEP are
contained in AFI 11-401 and AMCI 11-208. PICs will ensure personnel traveling in this status
are properly authorized. Crewmembers qualified in mobility aircraft are authorized MEP status
on any mobility aircraft to pre/de-position in support of mobility operations. MAJCOM
designated crewmembers who are assigned or authorized to accompany the normal crew
complement are allowed MEP status.
   3.16.1. Crewmembers in MEP status are not authorized to:
       3.16.1.1. Displace manifested passengers.
       3.16.1.2. Maintain currency and/or log flying time.
       3.16.1.3. Use for transportation while on leave. EXCEPTION: ANG/AFRC Air
       Technicians may be in a civilian leave status while traveling en route to perform in a
       military duty status.
       3.16.1.4. Travel on Special Air Missions/Command Support Mission (SAM/CSM)
       aircraft unless authorized by HQ AF/CVAM through the PIC.
       3.16.1.5. Travel on Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM) when specifically
       restricted by the mission directive.
       3.16.1.6. Travel on Operational Support Airlift (OSA) aircraft unless authorized by Joint
       Operational Support Airlift Command (JOSAC) through the PIC.
   3.16.2. All MEPs require valid travel/flight orders or supporting message authorizing MEP
   status. OG/CCs may authorize MEP status for their mobility aircrews.
   3.16.3. Flight evaluators have priority and will not be displaced by any other MEP. The
   priority for evaluators is MAJCOM, NAF, group, and then squadron level.
   3.16.4. MEPs normally travel in the crew compartment. If the number of MEPs desiring
   travel exceeds the capacity of the crew compartment, the C2 agency will notify the ATOC,
   who in turn will coordinate with the passenger terminal; seats not previously assigned may be
   used for MEPs.
   3.16.5. The PIC, or designated representative, will brief MEPs on seat assignment,
   appropriate mission information, emergency procedures including egress, and armed
 30                                                 AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


   crewmembers. The PIC may assign an MEP aircrew-related duties for which the MEP is
   qualified.
   3.16.6. MEPs will coordinate their travel with the appropriate C2 agency prior to travel.
   They will process through the C2 agency as early as possible but NLT 3 hours prior to
   planned block time.
3.17. Mission Mobility Observers (MMO). MAJCOM supplements or additional directives
may establish programs authorizing senior military and civilian personnel to fly for mobility
mission familiarization. For AMC MMO information reference AMCI 11-208, Tanker Airlift
Operations.
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                31


                                           Chapter 4

                        AIRCRAFT OPERATING RESTRICTIONS

4.1. Objective. Redundant systems may allow crews to safely perform some missions when a
component/system is degraded. The PIC is the final authority in determining the overall
suitability of an aircraft for the mission. The PIC will ensure a detailed explanation of the
discrepancy is entered in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document;
include the following maintenance identifiers to effectively communicate aircraft status.
   4.1.1. Mission Essential (ME). The PIC will designate an item, system, or subsystem
   component essential for safe aircraft operation as ME.
   4.1.2. Mission Contributing (MC). The PIC will designate an item, system, or subsystem
   component, which is not currently essential for safe aircraft operation as MC. These
   discrepancies should be cleared at the earliest opportunity. If circumstances change or
   mission safety would be compromised, re-designate as ME. Do not delay a mission to clear a
   MC discrepancy.
   4.1.3. Open Item (OI). The PIC will designate discrepancies not expected to adversely
   impact the current mission or any subsequent mission as an OI. These items are normally
   cleared at home station.
4.2. MEL Policy. The Minimum Equipment List (MEL) is a pre-launch document that lists the
minimum equipment/systems to operate the aircraft. It is impractical to prepare a list that would
anticipate all possible combinations of equipment malfunctions and contingent circumstances.
Consider equipment/systems with no listed exceptions as grounding items. A PIC who accepted
an aircraft with degraded equipment/systems is not committed to subsequent operations with the
same degraded equipment. PICs are not committed to operations with degraded equipment
accepted by another PIC.
   4.2.1. The PIC shall account for the possibility of additional failures during continued
   operation with inoperative systems or components. The MEL is not intended for continued
   operation over an indefinite period with systems/subsystems inoperative.
   4.2.2. All emergency equipment will be installed unless specifically exempted by mission
   requirements/directives.
   4.2.3. Waiver Policy. A PIC prepared to operate with a degraded MEL item shall request a
   waiver through C2 channels. The PIC shall provide the C2 agent: 1) nature of request, 2)
   individual crew member qualification, 3) mission leg(s) requiring the waiver, and 4) weather
   or other adverse condition, and 5) the governing directive of waiver request to include
   volume, chapter, or paragraph. Initiate waiver requests as soon as possible; plan at least a 1-
   hour waiver process time.
   4.2.4. PICs operating with waiver(s) for degraded equipment shall coordinate mission
   requirements (i.e., revised departure times, fuel requirements, maintenance requirements,
   etc.) with the controlling C2 agency and/or flight manager.
   4.2.5. If beyond C2 communication capability, or when it is necessary to protect the crew or
   aircraft from a situation not covered by this chapter and immediate action is required, the PIC
 32                                                    AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


   may deviate according to paragraph 1.4. Report deviations (without waiver) through
   channels to MAJCOM/A3/DO within 48-hours. OG/CCs shall collect background
   information and submit a follow-up written report upon request.
4.3. Waiver Protocol. Waivers to operate with degraded equipment are granted on a case-by-
case basis. The PIC determines the need for a waiver after coordinating with the lowest practical
level of command. MEL waiver authority is as follows:
   4.3.1. Training Missions. OG/CC or equivalent with mission execution authority.
   4.3.2. MAJCOM Directed Missions. MAJCOM/A3/DO with mission execution authority
   for active duty, AFRC, or ANG units flying MAJCOM-directed missions (includes
   Operational Readiness Inspections). Initiate the request with MAJCOM C2 agency. For
   AMC-directed missions contact HQ AMC/A3VS through TACC. HQ AMC/A3VS
   personnel are authorized on behalf of the AMC/A3 to grant these waivers. USAFE/A3T is
   authorized on behalf of USAFE/A3 to grant these waivers. NGB/A3O is authorized on
   behalf of NGB/A3 to grant these waivers.
   4.3.3. Contingency Missions. DIRMOBFOR (or equivalent) for the agency with C2, if not
   specified in the OPORD/Tasking Order.
   4.3.4. ANG and AFRC Directed Missions. ANG and AFRC maintain C2 and waiver
   authority for ANG or AFRC directed missions prior to mobilization.
   4.3.5. Other Than MEL Waivers. Determine governing source document (i.e. AFI, Flight
   Manual, Maintenance T.O., etc.) to ascertain the waiver authority. Use C2 channels to notify
   the appropriate waiver authority. Waivers of this nature may require an extended response
   time.
   4.3.6. Engineering Dispositions (ED). Dispositions are requested when aircraft are damaged
   and/or established maintenance technical order procedures cannot be followed or do not
   exist. The on-site maintenance authority is responsible for requesting Engineering
   Dispositions. Most EDs allow maintenance to repair the aircraft and return it to unrestricted
   status; dispositions of this nature do not concern aircrews. However, EDs affecting aircrew
   operations require MEL waiver authority approval.
       4.3.6.1. PICs shall coordinate dispositions containing flight restrictions, prohibitions,
       additional operating limits, or modified/nonstandard operating procedures with the
       appropriate MEL waiver authority (see paragraph 4.3).
       4.3.6.2. PICs will not accept dispositions appearing incomplete, in error, or unsafe. Prior
       to rejecting a disposition, the PIC will contact the appropriate MEL waiver authority.
       The waiver authority will attempt to resolve the issue. NOTE: Deviations from the flight
       manual requires approval IAW the flight manual.
   4.3.7. Airworthiness Directives (AD). ADs are the civil equivalent of a Time Compliance
   Technical Order (TCTO). ADs apply to C-21 aircraft. The aircraft‘s Systems Group (SG) is
   responsible to bring ADs to the attention of appropriate maintenance and operations units.
   When an AD is released the aircraft shall comply with the directive.
   4.3.7.1. PICs shall coordinate new ADs containing flight restrictions, prohibitions, additional
   operating limits, etc. with the appropriate MEL waiver authority (see paragraph 4.3).
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                 33


4.4. Technical Assistance. The PIC may request technical support and additional assistance
from their home unit or MAJCOM C2 agency.
4.5. MEL Table Definitions/Column Identifiers. MEL tables are arranged by aircraft system
to provide the PIC a mechanism to determine minimum system requirements. Components are
listed by number installed and minimum required for flight. Requirements are defined by Home
Station Departure/Main Operating Base (MOB) (Column A) and En Route (Column B). Refer to
the Remarks/Limitations/Exceptions column for clarification. AMC and AMC-gained aircrews
will consider Andrews AFB, Scott AFB, and Peterson AFB as MOBs. When transiting a MOB
on a pre-positioning or an active leg of a mission use Column A. When transiting a MOB on a
de-positioning leg use Column B. For example, an Andrews C-21 transiting Scott en route to
Peterson will use Column A. However, when transiting Scott en route to Andrews (de-
positioning) use Column B. NOTE: Column B requirements will not normally be waived when
transiting a MOB on a de-positioning leg. Local training missions, to include off-station trainers,
fall under Column B.
   4.5.1. Remarks/Limitations/Exceptions. Some technical information and procedures are
   contained in this column. This is not all-inclusive; crewmembers shall refer to the flight
   manual and other directives for procedures, techniques, limitations, etc.
       4.5.1.1. One-time Flight Clarification: Normally a Red X discrepancy is downgraded for
       a one-time flight. This condition does not preclude carrying cargo and passengers, unless
       restricted by the authority who downgraded the Red X. The priority is to move the
       airplane to a repair capable facility. PICs must coordinate with appropriate agencies to
       ensure repair capability exists at the destination. One-time flights may include en route
       stops only when necessary to recover the airplane. Example: An airplane departs on a
       gear-down flight from Djibouti IAP and requires an en route fuel stop (Cairo) before
       landing at the nearest repair capable facility, Sigonella NAS.
           4.5.1.1.1. One-time flight to nearest repair capable facility: Flight is limited to the
           nearest (shortest en route time) repair capable base.
           4.5.1.1.2. One-time flight to a repair capable facility: Flight is not restricted to the
           nearest repair capable facility.
       4.5.1.2. Other Mission and Repair Clarifications:
           4.5.1.2.1. Shall be repaired at next repair capable facility: Mission may continue as
           scheduled, item shall be repaired upon reaching a repair capable facility. Designate
           item ME upon reaching repair facility. Once maintenance action is initiated, and it is
           determined repairs are not possible, the PIC will discuss possible courses of action
           with C2 agency to return aircraft to service.
           4.5.1.2.2. Mission dictates requirement: PIC shall consider the entire mission profile,
           not just the next leg. Example: An airplane is departing an en route station with
           repair capability, after engine start the pilot discovers the #1 engine anti-ice is
           inoperative. Icing conditions are not forecasted for the next leg. However, because
           the mission spans several days and repair capability does not exist at the scheduled en
           route stops, the PIC elects to have the item repaired prior to departing.

   4.5.2. Warning and Caution annunciator lights not specifically mentioned in the MEL should
   normally be operative; however, the PIC should use good judgment in determining if the
   mission can proceed with a burned out bulb.
   4.5.3. A PIC may request a waiver to depart from a contract maintenance location if parts are
   available, but the delay would be unacceptable for mission completion.

                              OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

5.1. Checklists. A checklist is not complete until all items have been accomplished.
Momentary hesitations for coordination items, ATC interruptions and deviations specified in the
flight manual, etc., are authorized. Notes amplifying checklist procedures or limitations may be
added to the checklists. Currency of notes is a crewmember‘s responsibility.
   5.1.1. Checklist Inserts. MAJCOM/A3V and the AFMC Flight Manual Manager are the
   checklist insert approval authorities. Send checklist inserts to MAJCOM/A3V, who will in
   turn coordinate with AFMC for approval. All checklist inserts must have a POC. OGVs
   shall approve local in-flight guides and inserts not affecting T.O. guidance and procedures.
   5.1.2. Abbreviated checklists items that do not apply to the unit‘s aircraft or mission may be
   lined out.
   5.1.3. Fanfold Checklists. MAJCOM Stan/Eval approved fanfold checklists are authorized.
5.2. Duty Station. Both pilots shall be in their seats during flight. One of the pilots may be out
of their seat for brief periods to meet physiological needs and crew duties. With both pilots in
their seats, PICs may authorize rest periods for one pilot occupying a primary duty station during
non-critical phases of flight (the other pilot will be awake and alert). Comply with AFI 11-
202V3, oxygen requirements when one pilot is out of the seat.
5.3. Flight Station Entry. Passengers and observers will not be permitted access to primary
crew positions.
5.4. Takeoff and Landing Policy. An aircraft commander, or above, will occupy either the left
or the right seat during all takeoffs and landings (except for Operational Mission Evaluation
(OME) conducted IAW AFI 11-2C-21V2, C-21 Aircrew Evaluation Criteria). The designated
PIC (A code) is not required to occupy a primary position, but still retains overall authority for
conduct of the mission.
   5.4.1. Not used
       5.4.1.1. An IP or AC-certified pilot will make all takeoffs and landings during:
       5.4.1.2. Aircraft emergencies, unless conditions prevent compliance.
   5.4.2. Not used
   5.4.3. Unless the other pilot in the seat is a certified AC or higher, pilots in command (PIC)
   with less than 100 primary assigned aircraft (PAA) hours since AC certification will make all
   takeoffs and landings under any of the following conditions:
       5.4.3.1. Ceiling/visibility less than 300 feet and/or RVR 40 (3/4 SM visibility).
       5.4.3.2. RCR less than 12.
       5.4.3.3. Crosswind component greater than 15 knots.
   5.4.4. DV-2 Missions. All DV-2 or higher missions require an IP or an AC-certified pilot
   with at least 100 hours primary assigned aircraft (PAA) since certification as an AC. An AC-
   certified pilot or higher will make all takeoffs and landings. The waiver authority for the 100
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                 49


   hour restriction is the OG/CC or equivalent with mission execution authority. EXCEPTION:
   Alert launches with DV-2s may be flown with the alert crew; however, comply with AC
   takeoff and landing requirement.
5.5. Landing Gear and Flap Operating Policy. The pilot flying (PF) will command
configuration changes. The pilot monitoring (PM) will verify appropriate airspeed and
configuration prior to echoing the gear or flap actuation command. Normally, the pilot in the
right seat will operate the landing gear. Actuate the landing gear upon command of the pilot
flying the aircraft and acknowledgement by the other pilot. The PM should normally operate the
flaps. Actuate the flaps upon command of the pilot flying the aircraft, acknowledge the flap
setting commanded, and visually confirm the flap gauge indicates the desired setting. Instructors
may operate the flaps as required on training missions.
5.6. Outside Observer/Jump Seat Duties. Available crewmembers will assist in clearing
during taxi operations and any time the aircraft is below 10,000 feet MSL.
5.7. Seat Belts.
   5.7.1. All occupants will have a designated seat with an operable seat belt. Crewmembers
   will have seat belts fastened when occupying a duty position, unless crew duties dictate
   otherwise.
   5.7.2. All crewmembers will have seat belts fastened during takeoff and landing. Fasten
   shoulder harness unless crew duties dictate otherwise. For tactical operations, all
   crewmembers and passengers will have seat belts fastened (unless authorized by the PIC or
   crew duties dictate otherwise). Crewmembers performing instructor or flight examiner duties
   are exempt from seat belt requirements if not occupying a primary crew position; however,
   they will have a seat available with an operable seat belt.
   5.7.3. Litter patients, actual or simulated, must remain secured on litters for takeoff and
   landing.
5.8. Aircraft Lighting. IAW AFI 11-202V3, AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement
on the Ground, and applicable T.O.s.
5.9. Portable Electronic Devices. IAW AFI 11-202V3.
   5.9.1. Do not connect unauthorized equipment (laptop computers, video equipment, food
   preparation equipment, radios/tape players, CD players, etc.) to the aircraft intercom, PA,
   radio systems, or electrical system.
   5.9.2. Aircrew members shall not use uncertified Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)
   or personal devices with RF transmit/receive capability on AMC aircraft carrying hazard
   class 1 explosive cargo at anytime. Prohibited devices include cellular phones, and laptop
   computers/PDAs with wireless capability enabled (i.e. Bluetooth). Aircrew will ensure
   passengers comply with this restriction. Aircrew members may use certified GFE such as
   Portable Flight Planning System (PFPS) laptops and PDAs with infrared transmitters.
       5.9.2.1. Laptops are considered carry-on items for personal use. If not being used for
       patient care, it is permitted to plug laptops into the Spectrum unit as long as it meets the
       Spectrum power consumption requirements and does not interfere with ongoing patient
       care by medical personnel. Laptops used for patient care must be approved by
       appropriate medical authority. The Medical Crew Director (MCD) is the approval

       authority to plug laptops into the Spectrum unit. The Spectrum has two power outlets,
       which provide 115 VAC at 60 Hz, 3 amps max continuous load. EMI compliance is
       required for all laptops IAW AFI 11-202V3.
   5.9.3. Handheld GPS Units. The handheld (HH) GPS or portable GPS units (PGU) listed
   Carry-On Equipment Certification Letter posted on the AMC/A3V website at
   https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/a3v/publications.aspx meet the requirements of AFI 11-
   202V3 and may be used in flight.
       5.9.3.1. The use of HH GPS for moving map display (MMD) is designed as a situational
       awareness tool and its use for CONUS flight is voluntary.
   5.9.3.2. The use of handheld GPS units as an emergency backup for remote or oceanic flight
   is mandatory for UNS 1B equipped C-21 aircraft.
          5.9.3.2.1. The PGU will be used to verify the present position readout of onboard
          navigation equipment. If the FMS position becomes uncertain, compare the PGU
          position to each of the FMS sensor positions. Compare these to the flight plan and
          oceanic plotting chart to determine which is providing the best computed position.
          Use the best computed position in the event an update is required to the FMS.
       5.9.3.3. The PGU will be stowed for take-off and landing unless adequately secured to
       avoid becoming a projectile hazard.
   5.9.4. EMI certification letter for common use carry-on equipment is posted on the
   AMC/A3V website. ASC/ENAD will issue a new letter whenever there is a change
   and AMC/A3V will post the new letters on the AMC/A3V web site as soon as they are
   released: web address is https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/a3v/publications.aspx. Scroll down
   to ―Authorized Electronic Equipment‖ in the right column. The EMI certification letter is the
   first item.
       5.9.4.1. This letter only applies to the listed common use equipment referenced in the
       EMI certification letter. Listed equipment can be used on any mobility aircraft subject to
       limitations contained in the letter. Other portable electronic equipment not listed in this

 NOTES:
 (1) The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land or go-around.
 (2) With weather at CAT I minimums on a CAT I ILS, the pilot may not see the runway
 environment at DH; however, the initial portion of the approach lights may be visible. The
 pilot may continue to 100 HAT with reference to the approach lights only. The pilot may not
 descend below 100 feet above touchdown zone elevation (TDZE)/threshold elevation (THRE)
 using the approach lights as reference unless the red terminating bars or the red side row bars
 are distinctly visible and identifiable.
 (3) The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land, continue (CAT I), or go-around.
 Respond with the intention to land if runway environment is in sight, will remain in sight
 throughout touchdown and the aircraft is in a position for a safe landing.
 (4) If the pilot flying has stated ―landing‖ then this call is not required.
 (5) Refer to stabilized approach criteria in paragraph 5.12.
5.12. Stabilized Approach. Unstable approaches are primary contributors to numerous military
and civilian mishaps. Stabilized approaches are essential for the safe operation of aircraft and
are mandatory. The following criteria define specific parameters that mitigate risk during this
critical phase of flight. This philosophy requires aircrew to take immediate corrective actions to
stabilize the approach when outside designated parameters.
   5.12.1. The following criteria applies to all non-tactical approaches:
       5.12.1.1. At 1000 feet AGL:
           5.12.1.1.1. Aircraft is in approach configuration. Circling configuration is acceptable
           for circling approaches.
           5.12.1.1.2. Airspeed is at the appropriate speed for the configuration and conditions.
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                               53


         5.12.1.1.3. Sink rate is no greater than 1000fpm. Note: Under certain conditions
         (WX, Threats, Terrain, etc.) some IAPs and Tactical Approaches may require greater
         than a 1000 fpm descent rate.
             5.12.1.1.3.1. Non-precision Approaches. Pilots should calculate a constant
             descent gradient profile from the FAF altitude to the VDP (IAW AFMAN 11-
             217). This is considered the safest profile and should be used to the max extent
             possible. During a go-around, ensure descent below the MDA does not occur.
         5.12.1.1.4. All briefings and checklists are complete.
         5.12.1.1.5. Aircraft is on the correct track.
         5.12.1.1.6. Aircraft in the correct bank angle to maintain proper approach track for
         instrument, circling, or visual/tactical approach.
         5.12.1.1.7. Power set to maintain the descent profile at approach speed.
         5.12.1.1.8. If these criteria are not met by 1000 feet AGL, the PM will announce the
         deviation and the PF will take immediate corrective action. PM states ―1000 xxxx,‖
         where ―xxxx‖ equates to a concise description of the unstable characteristic(s) which
         clearly relay to the PF what actions are required to return the aircraft to a stable
         platform. Examples: ―1000, fast,‖ or ―1000, half dot low‖. If criteria are met, PM
         will simply state ―1000.‖
     5.12.1.2. From 500 AGL to the runway, if these parameters are exceeded the PM will
     announce ―Go-Around‖ and the PF will execute a go-around/missed approach. If criteria
     for stable approach are met, the PM will state ―500.‖     EXCEPTION: Reasonable
     allowance will be made to slow from circling airspeed to approach speed on a circling
     approach.
     5.12.1.3. Momentary minor corrections or deviations are acceptable and defined as:
         5.12.1.3.1. Airspeed: +10/-5 kts from target
         5.12.1.3.2. Bank Angle: +/- 15 degrees from target
         5.12.1.3.3. Rate of Descent: +/- 300 FPM from target
  5.12.2. Descent Planning and Energy Management. Aircrews will ensure the aircraft is
  following the planned descent profile. All non-tactical descents should follow a normal
  descent profile IAW AFMAN 11-217 procedures and techniques in the absence of ATC or
  FLIP guidance. All tactical descents should follow published tactical procedures/profiles.
  When unforeseen interruptions alter the planned descent, immediately correct any deviations.
  It may be necessary to hold, request vectors, or take alternate actions in order to comply with
  the planned descent profile.
     5.12.2.1. Training for tactical approaches using alternate stabilized approach criteria is
     permitted under direct IP supervision. This will be accomplished for realistic threats and
     valid training requirements only. Comply with briefing requirements above.
  5.12.3. Visual Transition. It is imperative for aircrews to review the airfield environment.
  Identify key features such as approach light type, airfield lighting, geographic
 54                                                      AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


   layout/configuration of runways, taxiways, ramps, etc. To the max extent possible, this study
   will take place during the crew mission briefing and reviewed again prior to descent.
   5.12.4. Missed Approach/Go-Around. Aircrews will conduct a thorough briefing for
   anticipated missed approach/go-around scenarios. This briefing will include a discussion of
   specific crewmember duties.
   5.12.5. Tactical Approaches. It is recognized the above criteria is not always valid due to
   the type of tactical approach required. In these situations (either real-world or training as
   briefed by Intel/Tactics or attained from other valid threat sources, e.g. GCI, AWACS,
   Tower, etc.) the PF is required to brief the maneuver parameters prior to execution, to include
   when to expect the aircraft to be stable and when to go around. If the threat is known prior to
   departure, the crew will accomplish briefing prior to departure during mission planning. If
   the threat arises during the sortie, the PIC will include the stability requirements as part of the
   arrival briefing.
5.13. Communications Policy. The Air Force does not give a promise of confidentiality to
aircrews regarding their recorded aircraft crew communications. Crewmembers are expected to
maintain a high degree of cockpit professionalism and crew coordination at all times.
   5.13.1. Aircraft Interphone. Primary crewmembers will monitor interphone during critical
   phases of flight. Crewmembers will advise the PIC before checking off interphone.
   Crewmembers will ensure personnel on headset, or within listening distance, are cleared
   prior to discussing classified information over interphone.
   5.13.2. Command Radios.
       5.13.2.1. The PM normally makes all air traffic control (ATC) radio calls.
       5.13.2.2. In terminal areas, all crewmembers (if able) will monitor the command radio
       unless directed otherwise. The PIC shall designate a crewmember to monitor C2
       frequencies on the inbound and outbound legs.
       5.13.2.3. The pilot operating the radios will notify the crew which radio is primary, and
       update the crew when the primary radio changes.
       5.13.2.4. One pilot will record and read back all ATC clearances.
       5.13.2.5. Both pilots will monitor UHF and VHF guard emergency frequencies to the
       maximum extent possible.
       5.13.2.6. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) prohibits the use of
       unauthorized frequencies for interplane, HAVE QUICK, or SECURE VOICE training.
5.14. Crew Resource Management (CRM).
   5.14.1. "Time Out" is the common assertive statement for use by all crewmembers. The use
   of "Time Out" will:
       5.14.1.1. Provide a clear warning sign of a deviation or loss of situational awareness.
       5.14.1.2. Provide an opportunity to break the error chain before a mishap occurs.
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                55


       5.14.1.3. Notify all crewmembers when someone sees the aircraft or crew departing from
       established guidelines, the briefed scenario, or that someone is simply uncomfortable
       with the developing conditions.
   5.14.2. As soon as possible after a "Time Out" has been called, the aircrew will take the
   following actions:
       5.14.2.1. Safety permitting, stabilize the aircraft.
       5.14.2.2. The initiating crewmember will voice their concerns to the crew.
       5.14.2.3. The PIC will provide all other crewmembers with the opportunity to voice
       inputs relative to the stated concerns.
       5.14.2.4. After considering all inputs, the PIC will direct the aircrew to continue the
       current course of action or direct a new course of action.
   5.14.3. Sterile Cockpit. With the exception of cruise flight, conversation below 18,000‘
   MSL will be limited to mission, departure, or approach essential items. Every effort will be
   made to accomplish briefings and appropriate checklists prior to top of descent (TOD).
   Sterile cockpit procedures also apply during taxi.
   5.14.4. Heads-up/Heads-down. Any crewmember that observes both pilots heads-down at
   the same time (other than heads-down instrument flying) shall alert the PF without delay.
5.15. Use of Automation. The PF will announce changes to the level of automation, flight
director and autopilot mode selections, and mode transitions to the maximum extent possible.
   5.15.1. General Automation Procedures. There must be a clear understanding of the Pilot
   Flying (PF) and the Pilot Monitoring (PM) duties at all times. Aircrews are expected to fly
   the aircraft using the highest level of automation, balanced with the requirement to maintain
   basic flying skills. However, pilots are authorized to choose an appropriate level of
   automation consistent with changing flight environments. If the use of automation creates a
   loss of situational awareness or results in task saturation, shift to a less demanding level or
   disconnect the automation entirely and re-establish desired aircraft path and control. Both
   pilots are responsible for ensuring the aircraft is following the desired flight path.
   5.15.2. Verbalize, Verify, and Monitor (VVM) is a closed-loop system of communication
   designed to significantly reduce typical automation selection errors between the PF and PM.
   VVM consists of the following three step process:
       5.15.2.1. Prior to making any changes in the Control Display Unit, Altitude Alerter, or
       FMS the pilot making the entries will VERBALIZE the intended changes.
       5.15.2.2. Both pilots will VERIFY the intended changes prior to execution.
       5.15.2.3. Both pilots will MONITOR the aircraft to ensure the expected performance is
       achieved.
5.16. Transportation of Pets. Transporting pets (dogs and cats) in conjunction with the
sponsor‘s permanent change of station is authorized. Other pets or animals are normally
prohibited, but may be moved according to DoD 4515.13R.
5.17. Alcoholic Beverages. The MAJCOM/A3/DO or NAF/CC may authorize the dispensing
of alcoholic beverages.
 56                                                   AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


5.18. Runway, Taxiway, and Airfield Requirements.
   5.18.1. Minimum Runway and Taxiway Requirements. Minimum runway length is
   5000ft/1525m or 6000ft/1830m for touch-and-go‘s. Minimum runway width is 70 feet.
   Minimum taxiway width is 35 feet. If operationally necessary, shorter runways are permitted
   provided:
      5.18.1.1. A qualified IP or EP performs the takeoff and landing
      5.18.1.2. Operations are limited to daytime. (Applicable OG/CC is waiver authority.)
      5.18.1.3. Takeoff distance does not exceed landing distance or landing distance is less
      than the paragraph 5.18.2 and 5.18.2.1 requirements.
      5.18.1.4. Runway available will not be less than 4,500 feet.
   5.18.2. Runway Length for Takeoff and Landing. Do not takeoff if takeoff distance adjusted
   for RCR exceeds runway available. Minimum runway for a normal landing is landing
   distance corrected for RCR. Minimum runway for a normal landing is landing distance
   based on a threshold crossing height of 50 feet.
      5.18.2.1. Runway Length for Takeoff and Intersection Takeoffs. Normally, the PF will
      initiate takeoffs from the beginning of the approved usable portion of the runway. The
      decision to make intersection takeoffs rests solely with the PIC.
      5.18.2.2. Pilots may accomplish intersection takeoffs provided the operating
      environment (i.e., gross weight, obstructions, climb criteria, weather, etc.) allows a safe
      takeoff and departure. Calculate takeoff performance based on the runway remaining
      from the point at which the takeoff is initiated.
      5.18.2.3. During operations on runways partially covered with snow or ice, base takeoff
      computations on the reported runway surface condition (RSC) or RCR for the cleared
      portion of the runway. A minimum of 25 feet either side of centerline should be cleared.
      If 25 feet either side of centerline is not cleared, compute takeoff data based on the
      uncleared portion up to 25 feet either side of centerline.
      5.18.2.4. Use of Overruns. If approach end overruns are available and stressed or
      authorized for normal operations, they may be used to increase the runway available for
      takeoff. Departure end overruns (if stressed and authorized) may also be used for landing
      if needed.
   5.18.3. Arresting Cables.
      5.18.3.1. Do not land on (touchdown on) approach end arresting cables (does not include
      recessed cables). If the aircraft lands before the cable, the crew should contact the tower
      to have the cable inspected.
      5.18.3.2. Do not takeoff or land over an approach end cable that has been reported as
      slack, loose, or improperly rigged by NOTAM, automated terminal information service
      (ATIS), or ATC.
      5.18.3.3. When conditions permit (aircraft gross weight, runway length, weather, winds,
      TOLD, etc.) and the PIC has considered the potential for damaging the aircraft, make
      takeoff and landings beyond raised cable barriers. If PICs determine they need the entire
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                             57


      length of the runway, use it. Be aware that operations over arresting gear barriers at
      speeds in excess of taxi speed may result in damage to the aircraft.
   5.18.4. Other Airfield Requirements.
      5.18.4.1. Consult with HQ AMC/A3AS (Airfield Suitability Branch) for suitability
      guidance. Airfield certification requirements are detailed in the ASRR.
      5.18.4.2. Aircrews and planning agencies will contact HQ AMC/A3AS for all questions
      pertaining to airfield weight bearing capacity and will review the GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR
      before all off-station operations. HQ AMC/A3 is the waiver authority for the restrictions
      in GDSS/GDSS2 Giant Report and ASRR for AMC and AMC-gained aircraft, unless
      specifically delegated in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 3 or AMCI 11-208. Direct GDSS/GDSS2
      Giant Report and ASRR waiver requests to HQ AMC/A3AS. HQ AMC/A3V is the OPR
      for waivers to airfield restrictions. MAJCOM/A3/DO is the waiver authority for non-
      AMC missions. The PIC is responsible for waiver compliance. Crews will review the
      ASRR via GDDS2 or Air Force Portal. If the crew does not have access to the ASRR
      contact the C2 agency. Consult the ASRR for airfield certification requirements.
      5.18.4.3. Not used.
   5.18.5. RCR Limitations. Use RCR values as prescribed in the aircraft flight manual. If a
   value is not reported, use RCR 12 for wet runways and RCR 6 for icy runways. Conversions
   from other braking action standards to RCR should be according to DoD FLIP documents.
   Normally, RCR values are not reported for taxiways and ramps. During periods of reported
   low RCR, the taxiways and ramps may have an even lower RCR than reported for the
   runway. The runway surface should be considered wet when water on the runway causes a
   reflective glare.
      5.18.5.1. RCR and RSC. The performance charts used to determine braking action are
      based on concrete runways. The RCR value for DRY is 23, WET is 12, and ICY is 6.
          5.18.5.1.1. For operations on wet, ungrooved runways, use RCR designated as ―wet‖
          in the aircraft flight manual for all takeoff and landing data. For operations on
          grooved runways, use reported RCR.
          5.18.5.1.2. Do not use runways with a reported RCR value less than 6.
   5.18.6. Wind Limitations.
      5.18.6.1. Airfields will be considered below minimums for takeoff and landing when
      winds (including gusts) are greater than established below:
          5.18.6.1.1. Maximum operating wind – 50 knots.
          5.18.6.1.2. Maximum tailwind component – 10 knots.
          5.18.6.1.3. Crosswinds – Maximum takeoff and landing crosswind component for
          any RCR 12 or above is 25 knots. Maximum takeoff and landing crosswind
          components, corrected for RCR, are shown in Table 5.5

Table 5.5. C-21 Takeoff and Landing Crosswind Components.

      5.18.6.2. The aircraft must be hangared at wind velocities of 85 knots or greater.
5.19. Aircraft Taxi and Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria and Foreign Object Damage
(FOD) Avoidance.
   5.19.1. Do not taxi an aircraft within 25 feet of obstructions without wing walkers
   monitoring the clearance between aircraft and obstruction. With wing walkers, avoid taxi
   obstructions by at least 10 feet. EXCEPTION: IAW AFI 11-218 aircraft may taxi without
   marshalers/wing walkers at home station along fixed taxi lines which have been measured to
   ensure a minimum of 10 feet clearance from any obstruction and the obstruction is
   permanent. Adjacent aircraft are also considered a permanent obstruction, provided the
   aircraft is parked properly in its designated spot and is not moving. Aerospace Ground
   Equipment (AGE) and vehicles are considered a permanent obstruction, provided it is parked
   entirely within a designated area. Areas will be designated by permanent markings such as
   painted boxes or lines on the ramp or another suitable means.
   5.19.2. When taxi clearance is doubtful, use one or more wing walkers. If wing walkers are
   unavailable, deplane one or more crewmembers to maintain obstruction clearance and
   provide marshaling using AFI 11-218 signals. Use wing walkers or deplaned crewmembers
   to act as an observer while maneuvering on narrow taxiways. During night taxi operations,
   marshalers will have an illuminated wand in each hand. Wing walkers are only required to
   have one illuminated wand. Observers should be in a position to see wing walkers at all
   times (through door or windows) and communicate with the pilot.
   5.19.3. FOD Avoidance. Make every effort to minimize the potential for engine FOD.
   Crews should:
      5.19.3.1. Carefully review airfield layout paying particular attention to taxi routes, turn
      requirements, and areas for potential FOD.
      5.19.3.2. Minimize power settings during all taxi operations.
5.20. Fuel Jettison Procedures.
   5.20.1. Aircrews should consider burning down fuel versus jettison, unless safety of flight
   dictates an immediate jettison (as determined by the pilot in command). Except in the case
   of an emergency, before jettisoning fuel, notify the appropriate ATC or flight service facility
   of intentions, altitude, and location. If available, the PIC will use designated jettison areas,
   except when safety of flight would be compromised.
   5.20.2. For missions tasked by higher headquarters authority, the tasking C2 agency (TACC,
   AMOCC, CAOC, etc.) may authorize fuel jettison when an urgent operational requirement
   dictates immediate recovery/reconstitution of the aircraft and/or aircrew. The tasking C2
   agency may provide fuel jettison instructions in the OPORD, mission directive, SPINS, etc.
   5.20.3. For training missions, the OG/CC may approve fuel jettison when an urgent
   operational requirement exists to expedite recovery of the aircraft and all alternatives have
   been exhausted.
   5.20.4. OG/CCs will establish jettison areas and procedures to minimize the impact of fuel
   jettisoning. Ideally, establish jettison areas at altitudes above 20,000 feet above ground level,
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                               59


   off published airways, avoiding urban areas, agricultural regions, and water supply sources.
   Avoid circling descents. Initiate AF Form 813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis,
   and submit it to the base environmental coordinator.
   5.20.5. All jettisons will be followed up with a detailed report filed by the pilot in command
   immediately after landing using a MAJCOM approved form for unusual occurrence or in
   flight emergency. Submit completed form through unit OGV to MAJCOM/A3V. Unit
   OGVs will retain forms for 6 months. Document all pertinent information, including the
   following items:
      5.20.5.1. Scheduled Duration.
      5.20.5.2. Actual Duration.
      5.20.5.3. Landing Gross Weight.
      5.20.5.4. Computed Stopping Distance.
   5.20.5.5. Recovery Field.
      5.20.5.6. Runway Available.
      5.20.5.7. Jettison Altitude/Location.
      5.20.5.8. Outside air temperature.
      5.20.5.9. Wind direction and velocity.
      5.20.5.10. Jettison Amount.
      5.20.5.11. Reason for Jettison.
      5.20.5.12. Approval Authority.
5.21. Aircraft Speed. IAW AFI 11-202V3.
5.22. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Programs. BASH programs are
centralized unit efforts that provide information cross-feed, hazard identification, and a
consolidated course of action. As a minimum, unit commanders must implement the following
procedures:
   5.22.1. Ensure compliance with the following Bird Watch condition restrictions.
      5.22.1.1. Bird Watch Condition Low - No operating restrictions.
      5.22.1.2. Bird Watch Condition Moderate - Initial takeoffs and final landings allowed
      only when departure and arrival routes will avoid bird activity. Local IFR/VFR traffic
      pattern activity is prohibited.
      5.22.1.3. Bird Watch Condition Severe - All takeoffs and landings are prohibited.
      Waiver authority is local OG/CC or equivalent. Parent MAJCOM/A3/DO waiver is
      required to operate at airfields not controlled by the MAF.
   5.22.2. Commanders establish Phase II of the BASH program during increased periods of
   migratory bird activity. Schedulers shall make every effort to not schedule takeoffs or
   landings from one hour before to one hour after sunrise and sunset during the Phase II period.
   Publish significant bird hazards in FLIP Area Planning (AP) and the IFR Supplement along
   with the associated airfield operating hour restrictions and avoidance instructions.
 60                                                   AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


   5.22.3. When operating at airfields where no BASH program exists, PICs have the authority
   to delay takeoffs and arrivals due to bird condition after coordinating with the appropriate C2
   authority.
   5.22.4. Consider bird migratory patterns during the en route portion of the mission to help
   minimize the potential of an in-flight bird strike. The Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) on HQ
   AFSC/SEF website contains BASH information including regionalized Continental United
   States (CONUS) bird migration patterns, Portable Flight Planning System (PFPS) software
   overlay, and the latest news. The Avian Hazard Advisory system (AHAS) website is another
   source for real time bird hazard information. Both sites may be accessed through the AMC
   aircrew mission planning portal. See AFPAM 91-212, Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH)
   Management Techniques, for additional information.
   5.22.5. Following a bird strike, aircrews should land as soon as conditions permit to have the
   aircraft inspected by qualified maintenance personnel. Bird strike damage cannot be
   accurately assessed in-flight, and undetected damage may result in a complex airborne
   emergency; only qualified maintenance personnel, on the ground, can make reliable damage
   assessments.
5.23. Functional Check Flights (FCFs) and Acceptance Check Flights (ACFs). Perform
FCFs and ACFs IAW T.O. 1-1-300, Acceptance/Functional Check Flight and Maintenance OPR
Checks, specific MDS FCF guidance (-6CF), AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance
Management, and applicable MAJCOM 21-series directives. Crews should only perform tasks
or functions contained in specific T. O. guidance. If requested to perform a non-standard
function, PICs should contact their OG/CC to see if an FCF applies.
   5.23.1. FCF Restrictions. See T.O. 1-1-300 and AFI 21-101.
   5.23.2. The OG/CC, or deployed equivalent, may authorize temporary waivers to FCF
   procedures for aircrew qualification when operationally necessary.
   5.23.3. The OG/CC is responsible for the wing FCF program. Publish additional guidance
   in local supplement to this instruction. The OG/CC may authorize a partial FCF to check
   only those systems disturbed by maintenance, an inspection or modification.
   5.23.4. Conduct check flights within the designated check flight airspace of the base from
   which the flight was launched except when the flight must be conducted under specific
   conditions, not compatible with local conditions and area restrictions. Airspace required for
   FCFs associated with depot maintenance should be coordinated with OGV.
   5.23.5. The decision to approve a combined FCF and ferry flight is the responsibility of the
   MAJCOM/A3/DO.
   5.23.6. The OG/CC will only certify highly experienced instructors as FCF crewmembers.
   The OG/CC will determine FCF crew complement after a thorough ORM assessment for that
   specific FCF flight.
   5.23.7. Ideally, conduct FCFs in day VMC. OG/CCs may authorize a flight under a
   combination of VMC and IMC. Begin the flight in VMC. If the aircraft and all systems are
   operating properly, the crew may proceed IMC through cloud cover to ―VFR on Top‖ for the
   altitude phase of the flight.
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                    61


   5.23.8. If a malfunction occurs during a FCF, the OG/CC may subsequently release the
   aircraft for flight providing the malfunction is not related to the condition generating the
   FCF, and the original condition operationally checked good.
   5.23.9. The OG/CC or deployed MC may authorize temporary waivers to FCF procedures
   for aircrew qualification when operationally necessary. Permanent waivers require
   MAJCOM/A3/DO approval IAW Chapter 1.
   5.23.10. ACFs specify guidelines for accepting depot aircraft and determine compliance
   with contractual requirements.
   5.23.11. In accordance with T.O. 1C-21A-6CF-1, Functional Check Flight Procedures
   (Learjet), conditions requiring an FCF include (but are not limited to) major retrofit
   modifications, removal or replacement of moveable flight control surfaces, major repairs that
   would affect the flying characteristics of the aircraft, adjustment, removal or replacement of
   major components of the flight control system for which airworthiness cannot be verified by
   maintenance operational checks, or removal or replacement of both engines.
   5.23.12. Only FCF crews shall perform high-speed taxi checks. Perform checks IAW the
   flight manual and maintenance T.O. Prepare the aircraft with minimum fuel necessary to
   accomplish the check to limit brake/tire wear, (ensure fuel on board will permit a safe return
   to base should the aircraft unexpectedly become airborne) and turn on the anti-skid system.
   The PIC will calculate takeoff data for the highest speed planned and ensure runway
   available allows sufficient stopping distance for existing conditions without exceeding
   normal brake energy limits.
   5.23.13. A Learjet trained and certified test pilot (i.e. civilian manufacturer) is required to
   perform stall series check flights. If two contract pilots are not available, a qualified USAF
   instructor pilot will complete the crew, but will not perform the stall series. The Learjet test
   pilot will be the PIC for this flight and operations will be conducted IAW Federal Aviation
   Administration (FAA) directives. USAF pilots will seek waivers to applicable AF directives
   as required.
   5.23.14. Flight authorizations for stall flights conducted at contractor locations shall be
   completed by the Government Flight Representative (GFR) for that location.
   5.23.15. Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 12 repair facilities do not have GFRs. For
   stall flights conducted at these facilities, the flight authorization will be completed by the unit
   supplying the USAF pilot IAW AFI 11-401; the unit will place the civilian contractor pilot
   on the flight authorization, with the PIC (―A‖) code. Comply with documentation
   requirements in AFI 11-401.
5.24. Participation in Aerial Events. See AFI 11-209, Aerial Events Policy and Procedures,
and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement.
5.25. Traffic Alert and Collision System (TCAS). It is imperative to follow resolution
advisories (RAs) to obtain aircraft separation computed by TCAS. Failure to follow the
computed RA may increase the probability of a midair collision. Pilots who deviate from an
ATC clearance in response to an RA shall notify ATC of the deviation as soon as practical and
promptly return to the ATC clearance when the traffic conflict is resolved or obtain a new
clearance.

5.26. Radio Altimeter.
   5.26.1. Before departure set the radio altimeter for emergency return. Normally, use the
   height above touchdown/height above aerodrome (HAT/HAA) for IMC, or 300 feet for
   VMC departures.
   5.26.2. Set the radio altimeter to the HAT/HAA during instrument approaches.
   5.26.3. Set the radio altimeter to 300 feet for Visual/VFR patterns.
5.27. Not used.
5.28. Not used.
5.29. Aircraft Recovery from Unprepared Surfaces. Aircrews will not normally attempt to
recover an aircraft after inadvertent entry onto unprepared surfaces not suitable for taxi; ground
crews will accomplish aircraft recovery. Unless an emergency dictates otherwise, aircrews may
only accomplish recovery if there is no aircraft damage, the surface will support the aircraft, and
the PIC has coordinated with appropriate MAJCOM HQ maintenance authorities.
5.30. Mode S. Aircrews will ensure flight ID is set in the transponder for every flight. Flight
ID must match the flight plan exactly, cannot exceed seven characters, and can have no spaces.
5.31. Engine Running Offload and Onload (ERO) Procedures. An ERO may be made if it
will not cause a deviation in scheduled itinerary of more than 30 minutes and all passengers are
available. Controlling agency (JOSAC for CONUS C-21s) approval is required if deviation is
more than 30 minutes early. In all cases, PICs will coordinate with local C2 agency, if available,
when an ERO is conducted. Ensure all participants are aware of engine danger area.
5.32. Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD). Use the AF Form 4040, C-21 Takeoff and Landing
Data to post takeoff and landing data. TOLD computations will be verified by another pilot.
Use of computerized TOLD programs as a primary reference is limited to those approved by
AMC/A3V.
   5.32.1. The electronic TOLD program provided for the C-21A by CAVU Companies has
   been validated and approved for use by AMC/A3V.
5.33. Mobility Aircrew Fall Protection. Aircrew members are prohibited from climbing onto
the upper fuselage or wing surfaces unless there is an operational necessity. When operational
conditions dictate, aircrew members may climb onto wing surfaces. PICs will ensure no other
personnel (excluding qualified ops/maintenance personnel) have access to, or are allowed to,
climb onto the fuselage or wings. EXCEPTION: Aircraft that do not have the ability to anchor
the maintenance safety harness and lanyard are exempt from the harness requirement until a
suitable alternate is available.
5.34. Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP). The Military Aviation Safety Action Program
is an anonymous, self-reporting system modeled after successful FAA/Airline programs to
encourage the voluntary reporting Operational issues and events. It is designed to provide a non-
punitive environment for the open reporting of safety concerns and information that might be
critical to identifying hazardous situations and precursors to accidents. These safety concerns
may be either observed or experienced by the submitter. The goal is to prevent mishaps by
addressing those unintentional errors, hazardous situations and events, or high-risk activities not
identified and/or correctable by other methods or through traditional safety reporting sources.

   6.2.10. AF Form 1199, Air Force Entry Control Card.
6.3. Pre-Mission Actions.
   6.3.1. Before transiting areas outside the CONUS, aircrews will review theater-specific
   information necessary to successfully operate there. The review, at a minimum, should
   include AFI 11-202V3, AFTTP 3-3.C-21, and the following:
      6.3.1.1. Review tasking and itinerary requirements.
      6.3.1.2. Review applicable OPORD, SPINS, Virtual Risk Assessment (VRA), Country
      Risk Assessment (CRA), and FLIP. Obtain and carry this information if required.
      6.3.1.3. Review the FCG for areas of operation (to include classified portion). Obtain
      necessary diplomatic clearances where required.
      6.3.1.4. Review Airspace classification, GDSS/GDSS2, ASRR, Giant Report and Airport
      Qualification Program (AQP) (if available).
   6.3.2. Obtain required customs forms.
   6.3.3. Obtain worldwide FLIP and sufficient communications security (COMSEC) materials
   for the duration of the mission.
   6.3.4. Ensure physiological training, annual physical, immunizations, and flight evaluations
   will remain current for all crewmembers throughout the TDY period.
   6.3.5. Ensure visas have been received, if required.
   6.3.6. Obtain terrain charts for unfamiliar destinations if available.
   6.3.7. Compile sufficient spare forms, flight orders, etc. to cover the TDY period.
   6.3.8. Passenger Restrictions. Release space available seats to the maximum extent possible
   unless overriding safety, legal or security concerns prohibit space available travelers from
   flying on specific missions. The only passengers on missions transporting DVs will be those
   of the official party and those space available passengers authorized by the lead POC for the
   traveling party. Authorization must be approved 24 hours in advance.
      6.3.8.1. Space Available Passengers. For other than revenue and White House missions,
      PICs are authorized to release space available seats on mission legs when no official
      passengers are aboard (positioning and de-positioning legs). Coordinate with C2 agency
      to release available seats to the passenger terminal. In addition PICs will coordinate with
      the Air Terminal representative upon arrival to convey final seat release availability.
      PICs are encouraged to release maximum space available seats subject to the following
      restrictions:
          6.3.8.1.1. Revenue Missions. These are missions for which the using agency
          (typically a government agency other than DoD) is reimbursing DoD for use of the
          aircraft. Space available passengers on revenue missions must be approved 24 hours
 66                                                   AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


           in advance by USAF/ CVAM, theater AMD or JOSAC (as appropriate) and the using
           agency contact officer through unit C2 agencies. This is essential to ensure proper
           funding and reimbursement. Consult C2 to determine mission revenue status if in
           doubt. Congressional Delegations (CODEL) are not revenue missions.
           6.3.8.1.2. White House Support Missions. Space available passengers will generally
           not be permitted aboard White House support mission aircraft without express
           permission of HQ USAF/CVAM. This is normally due to the security status of the
           aircraft, which may include positioning and de-positioning legs. When it is necessary
           to move aircrew members or support personnel on White House support mission
           aircraft, the WHMO will be advised and permission obtained through the unit C2 and
           CVAM. On de-positioning legs space available passengers will usually be permitted
           if the aircraft is no longer required to maintain an upgraded security status.
           6.3.8.1.3. Billing. Space available passengers on revenue missions may be subject to
           being billed commercial first-class airfare by the using agency for the applicable
           route, depending on that agency's policy. If the DV or on-board contact officer
           releases seats, aircraft commander must ensure that any additional financial liability
           for the passengers is specified by the using agency on-board contact officer. PIC will
           ensure passengers understand and agree to any reimbursement conditions prior to
           boarding.
   6.3.9. Ensure the correct aircraft navigation database is loaded or will be carried, as
   appropriate.
6.4. Aircrew Publications Requirements. Primary crewmembers will carry the publications
specified in Table 6.1 on all missions. Units may specify additional publications in their local
unit supplement.
   6.4.1. Although T.O. 1C-21A1, C-21 Flight Manual, is issued in electronic format, the
   primary inflight reference is the paper flight manual. Normally unit Stan/Eval will maintain
   paper flight manuals for use inflight. It is the PIC‘s responsibility to ensure currency and
   availability of paper manual for inflight use.

Table 6.1. Aircrew Publications.

6.6. Aircrew Intelligence Briefing. Aircrews will receive an intelligence briefing that will
emphasize terrorist, enemy, and friendly political and military development in the area in which
they will be flying. Obtain timely intelligence updates prior to entering a specific area of
operations (AOR). In theater, aircrews should receive intelligence updates on initial arrival at a
forward operating location (FOL), or en route stop, and thereafter when significant developments
occur. Report information of possible intelligence value to the local intelligence office as soon
as practical to ensure timely dissemination of mission reports (MISREPs).

Section 6B—Predeparture

6.7. Global Decision Scheduling System 2 (GDSS2) Account. Pilots will obtain a GDSS2
account prior to operating on IFM-planned sorties. Download aircrew departure papers using the
GDSS2 account, at locations without an AMC C2 presence. For operational missions, ensure
GDSS2 account passwords are active prior to departing home station. If there is no GDSS2
access contact the flight manager.
6.8. Flight Crew Information File (FCIF).
   6.8.1. Crewmembers will review FCIF, Volume 1, before all missions or ground aircrew
   duties, and update the FCIF currency record with the latest FCIF item number, date, and
   crewmember's initials.
       6.8.1.1. Electronic signatures, or PEX Sign-Off, may be used on FCIFs.
   6.8.2. Crewmembers delinquent in FCIF review or joining a mission en route will receive an
   FCIF update from a primary aircrew member counterpart on the mission. Instructor pilots
   who fly with general officers are responsible for briefing appropriate FCIF items.
   6.8.3. Crewmembers not assigned or attached to the unit operating a mission will certify
   FCIF review by entering the last FCIF number and their initials after their name on the file
   copy of the flight authorization or file copy of their crew orders. This applies to all
   crewmembers if the electronic sign-in system is not working at show time.
6.9. Flight Crew Bulletins (FCB). Items in the FCB may include local procedures and policies
concerning equipment and personnel generally not found in any other publications.
6.10. Mission Kits. Carry mission kits on all operational missions. Mission kits may have
some items prepositioned on the aircraft. Suggested items include: NOTE: * Indicates

6.12. Briefing Requirements.
   6.12.1. Pre-Departure Briefing Items. The PIC will contact the local C2 agency to confirm
   mission requirements. The PIC and controlling agency jointly share responsibility to identify
   special briefing requirements.
   6.12.2. Pilot in Command Pre-Departure Briefing. Cover all applicable items of the
   operations briefing, including MAJCOM, NAF, unit special interest items (SIIs), CRM, and
   ORM levels and mitigating factors. Brief crewmembers on the specific mission details if not
   previously accomplished. Use a MAJCOM approved briefing guide.
      6.12.2.1. Pilot in Command Enroute Briefing. In the en route system, the PIC will
      ensure that an aircrew briefing is conducted prior to the first sortie of the day. As a
      minimum, brief crewmembers on specific mission details for that day's sortie(s), CRM,
      and the ORM level and mitigating factors for the mission. Complete this briefing prior to
      engine start.
   6.12.3. Specialized Briefing. Use specialized briefings to detail operating procedures or SIIs
   peculiar to various crew positions, and to answer questions relating to those specialties.

   6.12.4. Weather Briefings. The PIC will obtain a briefing on current weather, trends, and
   forecast for the proposed route, destination, and alternates. The PIC will brief primary
   crewmembers on appropriate weather conditions before departure.
       6.12.4.1. Aircrews flying flight-managed sorties will use the weather briefing provided
       with the IFM aircrew departure papers. Local weather flights/agencies may update local
       takeoff weather data, but aircrews, working through their flight manager/dispatcher, will
       use 618 TACC weather operations (or the Operational Weather Squadron (OWS)
       supporting the theater C2 Agency) as the final arbiter for weather-related issues and
       further updates.
       6.12.4.2. On sorties not planned by a flight manager, crews should obtain weather
       information from their local weather flight or the OWS responsible for weather support at
       their location.
       6.12.4.3. If adequate services are not available, and the crew cannot contact their home
       weather flight, OWS, or TACC weather operations, obtain weather through any means
       available prior to mission accomplishment.
       6.12.4.4. Weather information is permitted from US Military weather services, any
       FAA-approved weather source, or any host nation civil or military weather source.
   6.12.5. Buffer Zone. Prior to operating an aircraft within, or adjacent to, an established
   buffer zone, the PIC will ensure primary crewmembers are briefed on current buffer zone
   procedures outlined in appropriate directives.
   6.12.6. Peacetime and Wartime SAFE PASSAGE Procedures. Pilots must be familiar with
   peacetime and wartime safe passage of friendly military aircraft.
   6.12.7. IFM Briefing. PICs will thoroughly review the aircrew departure papers provided
   for IFM sorties. The PIC, or designated representative, will contact the flight manager if
   there are discrepancies with the departure papers or to resolve any questions before signing
   the flight plan.
   6.12.8. Training/Evaluation Briefing.         Before all training/evaluation missions,
   instructors/flight examiners will brief the crew on requirements and objectives for each
   student or examinee.
6.13. Call Signs.
   6.13.1. Training Missions. Aircraft will use the unit static call sign assigned by the parent
   unit.
   6.13.2. Operational Missions. CONUS OSA missions under JOSAC control will normally
   use ―JOSA‖ followed by the last three digits of their mission number. Use call signs
   assigned by OPORD, FRAG, or diplomatic clearance, when required. If no call sign has
   been assigned, use unit static call signs. When flying AMC channel missions and no call
   sign has been assigned, use the ―REACH‖ call sign followed by the last digit of the year the
   aircraft was built and the last 3 digits of the aircraft tail number or as required by diplomatic
   clearance.
   6.13.3. The Reach 01 and 18 call signs are reserved for the AMC/CC and 18 AF/CC.
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                 71


   6.13.4. Aeromedical Evacuation (AE). For actual AE missions, use the call sign ―Evac"
   followed by the five-digit aircraft number (example, Evac 12345) or mission designator.
   Refer to FLIP GP Chapter 4. When the AE portion of the mission is completed, normal call
   signs will be used. This does not alleviate the responsibility to use diplomatically cleared
   call signs when required.
   6.13.5. Search and Rescue. On actual search, rescue, and recovery missions, use the call
   sign "Air Force Rescue" plus the last five digits of the aircraft tail number.
6.14. Instrument Flight Rules. Conduct flight operations under IFR to the maximum extent
possible without unacceptable mission degradation.
6.15. Flight Plan/Data Verification.
   6.15.1. Computer Flight Plan (CFP) Use. CFPs are the official sources of performance,
   navigation, and climatic data, including en route wind information. If stand-alone computer
   based plans are used, each mission segment should utilize best wind data available. Use only
   MAJCOM validated CFPs.
       6.15.1.1. Use CFPs to the maximum extent practical. Flight crews may manually
       compute flight plans. The PIC has final responsibility for flight plan accuracy and
       diplomatic clearance compliance.
       6.15.1.2. Verify CFPs for route of flight and fuel computation accuracy before departure.
       Pass any flight plan discrepancies to the C2 flight planning office. On flight-managed
       sorties, promptly notify the flight manager of any flight plan discrepancies, to ensure the
       correct route of flight is filed with air traffic control. Identify inaccurate CFP winds to
       TACC/XOCZF if the average wind for a route segment exceeds either 30° error in
       direction or 25 knots in speed.
   6.15.2. All waypoint data retrieved from a database should be verified by one or more of the
   following methods:
       6.15.2.1. Latitude/longitude from current FLIP.
       6.15.2.2. Bearing/distance from a flight plan after latitude/longitude are verified for each
       waypoint.
       6.15.2.3. Ground Based NAVAIDs.
6.16. Departure Planning. Use AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217V1, this chapter, and the
appropriate MAJCOM supplements. Regardless of the type of departure flown (IFR/VFR),
review the following (as appropriate): IFR Departure Procedure, instrument approach
procedures, NOTAMS, GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR, and suitable terrain charts. Compute TOLD using
T.O. 1C-21A-1, T.O. 1C-21A-1CL-1, and/or OGV-approved performance data extracts. All
TOLD computations should be verified by both pilots.
   6.16.1. VFR Departures. NOTE: VFR departures will not be flown in lieu of obstacle
   clearance planning.
       6.16.1.1. VFR departures are authorized when there is no authorized IFR departure
       procedure for the airport, when the aircraft cannot depart using one of the IFR departure
       methods contained in AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1, when operational
       requirements dictate (i.e. tactical necessity), or when most of the sortie is planned as a
72                                                  AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


     VFR flight. VFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and terrain are
     avoided.
     6.16.1.2. IAW AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V2 crews are specifically authorized
     to depart VFR without meeting IFR departure procedure restrictions along the planned
     departure route with one engine inoperative while adhering to the following:
        6.16.1.2.1. Utilize radar advisory, monitoring, or control services when practical, and
        ensure flight following by any available means (ie FSS or C2).
        6.16.1.2.2. Consider reducing aircraft gross weight and/or delaying the mission until
        environmental conditions improve.
        6.16.1.2.3. Crews must be knowledgeable of and comply with guidance contained in
        AFMAN 11-217V2.
        6.16.1.2.4. Crews are responsible for terrain and obstacle planning/avoidance and
        must climb to the Minimum IFR Altitude (MIA) as soon as practical.
        6.16.1.2.5. Crews will use all available resources to mitigate risk. This includes (but
        not limited to) supervisors, ORM, aircraft flight manuals, and aircraft commander
        discretion.
        6.16.1.2.6. Operations IAW this authorization are to be used as the last resort when
        the mission justifies the increased risk.
     6.16.1.3. The minimum climb performance for VFR departures is determined by
     ensuring all the following conditions are met:
        6.16.1.3.1. All-engine climb capability ensures obstacle avoidance along the
        departure route.
        6.16.1.3.2. One Engine Inoperative (OEI) climb capability shall ensure departure or
        emergency return route provides obstacle avoidance.
     6.16.1.4. Refer to FLIP for host nation VFR requirements before flying VFR outside of
     CONUS.
     6.16.1.5. When departing VFR, maintain VFR cloud clearances until obtaining an IFR
     clearance and reaching the IFR MEA.
  6.16.2. IFR Departures. Aircrews must use an approved IFR departure method as outlined
  in AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1.
     6.16.2.1. An IFR departure is not authorized at airfields without an instrument approach.
     6.16.2.2. IFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and high terrain
     are avoided. Adhere to screen height/departure end of runway (DER) requirements for
     IFR departure planning (AFMAN 11-217V1). NOTE: Screen height requirements for
     departures depend on the agency that wrote the departure and/or the airfield where the
     departure is being flown. There is no standard or easy way for crews to determine screen
     height requirements. Therefore, when using departures other than those listed below, or
     when any doubt exists about which screen height to use, plan to cross the DER at 35 feet
     (minimum) unless you can ascertain a different screen height requirement from an
     appropriate authority.
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                              73


        6.16.2.2.1. Special Departure Procedure: Published on SDP.
        6.16.2.2.2. USAF/USN produced SID or USAF/USN/USMC airfield: Zero feet.
        6.16.2.2.3. US Army, FAA SID, and Joint Use Airfield within the US: 35 feet unless
        published.
        6.16.2.2.4. NATO Countries (except US and Canada) Military Airports: 35 feet.
        6.16.2.2.5. NATO Countries (except US and Canada) Civil Airports: 16 feet or as
        published.
        6.16.2.2.6. Other ICAO nations: 16 feet or as published.
        6.16.2.2.7. All others: 35 feet unless published.
     6.16.2.3. Aircraft must meet the published climb gradient for the departure runway with
     all engines operating. If no minimum climb gradient is published, 200 ft/nm will be used.
     NOTE: In the event the aircraft is unable to meet the published ALL ENGINE climb
     gradient, download cargo/fuel or delay until more favorable conditions exist.
     6.16.2.4. Use one of the following methods to ensure the aircraft can vertically clear all
     obstacles along the planned departure route with OEI:
        6.16.2.4.1. Special Departure Procedure (SDP). SDPs are MDS-specific OEI escape
        procedures intended only for emergency use. They are applicable after the loss of an
        engine and, where available, will be used for engine-out departure planning. Retrieve
        current SDPs from the SDP website (contact OGV for current username password).
        ‗Ad hoc‘ requests for fields not currently listed may be requested through OGV NLT
        48 hrs prior to scheduled departure. HQ AMC/A3VS authorizes the use of Ad Hoc
        SDPs for a maximum of 7 days after the analysis date.
        6.16.2.4.2. Minimum climb gradient. The TERPS standard minimum climb gradient
        is 200 ft/nm, which is based on the standard obstacle clearance surface (OCS) of 152
        ft/nm plus the required obstacle clearance (ROC) of 48 ft/nm. If an SDP is not
        available, the crew must ensure compliance with any obstacle-based minimum climb
        gradients for the selected departure, with one-engine inoperative. Minimum climb
        gradients may be published as a ‗Trouble T‘ restriction in the IFR Take-off
        Minimums section of FLIP or on a SID. When required for mission accomplishment,
        crews may subtract 48‘/nm from published climb gradients before computing engine-
        out takeoff data. Minimum climb gradients do not take into account low, close in
        obstacles (obstacles or terrain 200‘ AGL and below) which should normally be
        published as a NOTE on the SID or IFR departure procedure (Trouble T).
     6.16.2.4.3. Comply with all climb gradient guidance in AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-
     217V1 for all engines operating (AEO) and one-engine inoperative (OEI).
     6.16.2.4.4. There are no AEO climb charts in T.O. 1C-21A-1, C-21 Flight Manual. All
     engine climb capability will be at least double the charted single-engine climb capability;
     provided flaps are in takeoff configuration, takeoff thrust is maintained and airspeed is
     V2+25 or less.
 74                                                    AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


       6.16.2.4.5. When AEO climb gradient is most restrictive for takeoff (i.e. ATC climb
       gradient), use the obstacle takeoff and climb procedures described in T.O. 1C-21A-1,C-
       21 Flight Manual Section 2.
       6.16.2.4.6. C-21 aircrews are permitted to subtract 48 ft/nm (0.8%) from the published
       climb gradient to compute OEI requirements when the mission priority justifies the
       increased risk. NOTE: If the requirements of 6.16.2.4. cannot be met, download
       cargo/fuel or delay until requirements can be met.
6.17. Weather Minimums for Takeoff use Table 6. 3.

Table 6.3. Weather Minimums for Takeoff.
 MISSION       VIS     REMARKS

 Operational 1000      When less than RVR 1600, but equal to or greater than RVR 1000, the
             RVR       crew may take off if mission priority dictates, provided the runway has
                       dual RVR readouts and displays (minimum RVR 1000 on both) and
                       runway centerline lighting is operational. For any takeoff below 1600
                       RVR, the crew must be fully qualified.


 All others    1600    For runways with more than one operating RVR readout, RVR must read
               RVR     1600 minimum on all.

 NOTES:
 If no RVR readout is available for the departure runway, visibility must be reported to be 1/2
 mile (800 meters).
 When weather is below approach and landing minimums (ceiling or visibility) a takeoff
 alternate is required (See paragraph 6.19.)

6.18. Alternate Planning. Select alternate airports meeting the requirements of AFI 11-202V3.
Choose alternates that best meet mission requirements and conserve fuel; they should not be
within the same terminal area, if terminal forecasts are marginal. Select alternates that are not
restricted by FLIP, FCG, or diplomatic clearances, and are compatible with the mission load and
performance characteristics of the aircraft. The PIC retains final authority in the choice of
alternates; however, selection by support agencies normally should be used if they meet the
above criteria and the aircraft has already been serviced.
6.19. Departure Alternates.
   6.19.1. A departure alternate is required if weather (ceiling or visibility) is below landing
   minimums for the available approach (at departure aerodrome).
   6.19.2. Suitability of Departure Alternates. When a departure alternate is required, the
   aircraft must be capable of maintaining the MEA or minimum obstruction clearance altitude
   (MOCA), whichever is higher, to the alternate using OEI performance criteria. To qualify as
   a departure alternate, the airfield must meet one of the following conditions:
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                     75


       6.19.2.1. For an alternate within 30 minutes flying time, the existing weather must be
       equal to or better than the published approach minimums and forecast to remain so until 1
       hour after takeoff, but in no case forecast to be lower than 200-1/2 (RVR 2400), or;
       6.19.2.2. For an alternate within 1 hour flying time, the existing weather must be at least
       500-1 above the lowest compatible published approach minimums, but not less than 600-
       2 for a precision approach or 800-2 for a non-precision approach, and forecast to remain
       so for 1 hour after ETA at the alternate.
6.20. Destination Requirements (for filing purposes). Plan fuel to an alternate only when 11-
202V3 and AFI 11-2C-21V3 require the filing of an alternate. The forecast destination weather
will be according to AFI 11-202V3 and the following:
   6.20.1. File two alternates when:
       6.20.1.1. The forecast visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than published for the
       available DoD or National Aeronautical Charting Office (NACO) precision approach; or
       6.20.1.2. The forecast ceiling OR visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than
       published for all non-DoD/NGA/NACO approaches. For approaches with no published
       ceiling requirement (for example Jeppesen approaches), the minimum required ceiling
       shall be computed by taking the published HAA or HAT and rounding it up to the nearest
       one hundred feet (or as determined by MAJCOM TERPs review). For example, a
       Jeppesen VOR approach with a published HAA of 642 feet would require a forecasted
       ceiling of 700 feet; or
       6.20.1.3. The forecast surface winds (intermittent or prevailing) exceed limits corrected
       for RCR.
       6.20.1.4. IAW AFI 11-202V3 paragraph 8.7.1.1.1, AMC waives the minimum weather
       for an airfield requiring an alternate to a ceiling of 1000 ft and visibility of 2 statute miles
       when two or more suitable independent precision approaches are available and operable
       for the airport of intended landing at ETA (± 1 hour). This weather minimum includes
       TEMPO and prevailing conditions for intended landing destination within one hour of
       arrival.
           6.20.1.4.1. Qualifying airfield requirements. Major airports with two or more
           separate runways, each with precision approaches operating at the same time qualify
           for the requirement for reduced weather minimums. Multiple precision approaches to
           only one end of the runway do not count. Two ILSs that use the same freq/antennas
           do not qualify as two independent approaches.
   6.20.2. File an alternate, regardless of forecast weather, when the destination aerodrome is
   outside the CONUS. EXCEPTION: OCONUS, intra-theater flights that do not exceed 3-
   hours, comply with basic AFI 11-202V3.
   6.20.3. When filing to a remote or island destination, aircrews may use holding in lieu of an
   alternate airport. In such situations, use 2+00 hours reserve fuel (1+15 holding in lieu of an
   alternate and 0+45 reserve). For remote destinations, reserve and contingency fuel, will be
   computed using consumption rates providing maximum endurance at 20,000 feet MSL at
   destination gross weight. A remote or island destination is defined as any aerodrome, which
   due to its unique geographic location, offers no suitable alternate (civil or military) within 2
 76                                                    AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


   hours of flying time. The forecast weather at the remote or island destination must meet the
   following criteria:
      6.20.3.1. The prevailing surface winds, corrected for RCR, must be within limits at ETA
      and forecast to remain so for 2 hours thereafter, and
      6.20.3.2. The prevailing ceiling and visibility must be equal to or greater than published
      minimums for an available non-precision approach, for ETA plus 2 hours. However, if a
      precision approach is available, the ceiling or visibility may be intermittently below non-
      precision approach minimums (excluding ASR), but not below precision approach
      minimums (for ETA plus 2 hours). NOTE: See Chapter 14 for fuel planning
      considerations to a remote or island destination.
6.21. Adverse Weather.
   6.21.1. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence is prohibited.
      6.21.1.1. Crews should confirm the type of aircraft the forecast turbulence applies to, or
      what type of aircraft reported the encounter, to gain a more accurate picture for their
      route of flight. Turbulence category charts are found in Air Force Weather Agency
      technical note AFWA/TN 98/002, Meteorological Techniques.
      6.21.1.2. The PIC is responsible for ensuring all passengers are seated, with seat belts
      fastened, when areas of moderate or greater turbulence are encountered or anticipated.
      WARNING: Serious injury may occur if passengers do not have their seat belts fastened
      and the aircraft encounters moderate or severe turbulence.
   6.21.2. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe icing is prohibited. Prolonged
   operation, such as cruise flight or holding, in areas of moderate icing should be avoided.
   NOTE: Air Force Weather Agency technical note AFWA/TN 98/002, Meteorological
   Techniques, states that icing may be severe in any type of freezing precipitation. When
   freezing fog, drizzle, or rain are forecast or reported, aircrews should confirm with the local
   weather agency what type/intensity of icing is associated with the freezing precipitation.
      6.21.2.1. Do not takeoff under conditions of freezing rain. Do not takeoff under
      conditions of freezing drizzle except when aircraft has been properly de-iced/anti-iced
      IAW flight manual procedures.
      6.21.2.2. Freezing precipitation, snow, freezing fog, or temperatures below 0°C, may
      cause ice or frost to accumulate on aircraft surface. When an aircraft requires de-
      icing/anti-icing prior to takeoff, refer to the following:
          6.21.2.2.1. Aircrews will only use de-ice and anti-ice fluids listed in the C-21 flight
          manual. Aircrews will be familiar with, and follow all restrictions in the C-21 flight
          manual with respect to anti-ice/de-ice procedures and holdover times.
          6.21.2.2.2. MIL-A-8243 Type I and Type II de-icing fluids provide little anti-icing
          benefit, and therefore have limited holdover times. As a guide, for approved fluids,
          crews may use published holdover times IAW TO 42C-1-2, Aircraft Anti-icing
          Procedures, and AFFSA holdover tables located at the AFFSA/A3OF Flight
          Directives                             Division                              website,
          https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=OO-OT-SA-03.
          The holdover time begins when anti-icing fluid is first applied and the PIC shall use
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                               77


         time, temperature, and dilution of mixture to determine when times are exceeded and
         re-apply fluid if required.
         6.21.2.2.3. In all cases, PICs will ensure a visual inspection of the aircraft is
         completed within 5 minutes of departure.
  6.21.3. Do not fly directly above (within 2,000 feet) thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds.
  If unable to vertically clear thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds by at least 2000 feet,
  avoid them by at least:
     6.21.3.1. 20 NMs at or above flight level (FL)230.
     6.21.3.2. 10 NMs below FL230.
     6.21.3.3. 5 NMs for tactical low-level operations below FL230 provided the outside air
     temperature is at or above 0°C at flight altitude. Avoid gust fronts and winds preceding a
     rapidly moving thunderstorm. CAUTION: Aircraft damage may occur 20NMs or more
     from any thunderstorm. Aircrews must familiarize themselves with information on
     thunderstorm development and hazards. Refer to AFH 11-203, Volumes 1 and 2,
     Weather for Aircrews.
  6.21.4. The use of ground-based radar as a means of thunderstorm avoidance should only be
  used to assist in departing an inadvertently penetrated area of significant weather. It should
  never be considered a normal avoidance procedure. When relying exclusively on ground-
  based radar for weather avoidance, and the ground controller is unable to provide avoidance
  instructions, attempt to maintain VMC by:
     6.21.4.1. Changing routing.
     6.21.4.2. Diverting to alternate.
     6.21.4.3. Declaring an emergency and requesting priority assistance.
  6.21.5. Aircrews should avoid flying in areas of recently dissipated thunderstorms and
  advected clouds (horizontal movement of clouds caused by wind) downwind of
  thunderstorms.
  6.21.6. In order to minimize exposure to thunderstorm hazards when approaching or
  departing an airport in an area where thunderstorms are occurring or are forecast:
     6.21.6.1. Attempt to maintain VMC.
     6.21.6.2. Maintain at least 5 NMs separation from heavy rain showers.
     6.21.6.3. Avoid areas of high lightning potential, i.e. clouds within plus or minus 5,000
     feet of the freezing level or plus or minus 8°C of the freezing level. NOTE: Approaches
     or departures may be accomplished when thunderstorms are within 10NMs providing
     they are not producing any hazardous conditions (such as hail, lightning, strong winds,
     gusts fronts, heavy rain, wind shear, or microburst) at the airport, and are not forecast or
     observed to be moving in the direction of the route of flight (to include the planned
     missed approach corridor, if applicable).
  6.21.7. When performing approaches and landings at locations where temperatures are 0°C
  or below, refer to the Flight Information Handbook (FIH) Section D, Temperature Correction
 78                                                     AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


   Chart, and AFI 11-202V3, Temperature Correction paragraph, to ensure adequate obstacle
   clearance.
   6.21.8. Do not fly into an area of known or forecast moderate or greater mountain wave
   turbulence. Refer to AFH 11-203 for additional information on mountain wave turbulence.
   6.21.9. Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET). National Weather Service in-
   flight weather advisories are not limiting to Air Force aircraft. Contact the nearest military
   weather facility or flight service station for details, if applicable.
   6.21.10. Volcanic Dust Precautions. Aircraft flight operations in areas of forecast or known
   volcanic activity or dust is prohibited. Plan all missions to avoid volcanic activity by at least
   20 NMs.
   6.21.11. Lightning Avoidance. The following conditions are most conducive to lightning
   strikes and prolonged flight in them should be avoided:
       6.21.11.1. Within 8C of freezing.
       6.21.11.2. In clouds or in any intensity of precipitation or turbulence associated with
       thunderstorm activity.
6.22. Operational Risk Management (ORM). ORM is a logic based, common sense approach
to making calculated decisions on human, material, and environmental factors before, during,
and after all operations. USAF policy on ORM is contained in AFI 90-901, Operational Risk
Management. PICs will accomplish ORM worksheets IAW MAJCOM and local guidance as
part of preflight activities.
   6.22.1. Flying units will develop a local ORM program to include personal ORM assessment
   for all missions and accomplished by all crewmembers prior to each flight.

Section 6C—Preflight

6.23. Hazard Identification and Mitigation. After the entire crew is assembled at the aircraft,
the PIC will brief primary mission hazards facing the crew during takeoff and climb-out.
6.24. AFTO Forms 781 Series.
   6.24.1. Review AFTO Forms 781 series before applying power to the aircraft or operating
   aircraft systems. An exceptional release must be signed before flight. A maintenance
   officer, maintenance superintendent, or authorized civilian normally signs the exceptional
   release. If one of these individuals is not available, the PIC may sign the exceptional release.
   Ensure that the DD Form 1896, DoD Fuel Identaplate, and Multi-Service Corporation
   (MSC) card are aboard the aircraft.
   6.24.2. One-Time Flights. An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight with a condition
   that might be hazardous for continued use, provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to
   another station. Refer to T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection,
   Documentation, Policies, and Procedures, for downgrade authority and procedures. AFRC
   crews also see AFI 11-202V3/AFRCSUP1, Aircrew Training. After the maintenance release
   is obtained, coordinate mission requirements with the controlling agency. The PICs
   concurrence is required before the aircraft can be flown.
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                79


   6.24.3. For Red X clearing procedures at stations without maintenance support refer to
   Chapter 12.
6.25. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations. Reference Chapter 12.
6.26. Aircraft Recovery Away from Main Operating Base (MOB). Reference Chapter 12.
6.27. Aircrew Flight Equipment Requirements.
   6.27.1. Oxygen. Oxygen on board for takeoff must be sufficient to accomplish the planned
   flight from the equal time point (ETP) to recovery should oxygen be required (minimum
   1550 PSI).
       6.27.1.1. All C-21 aircraft normally have two emergency escape breathing devices
       (EEBD) and eight emergency passenger oxygen system (EPOS) permanently pre-
       positioned on the aircraft. The EPOSs may be stored in the life support helmet bag when
       no passengers are carried.
       6.27.1.2. On flights carrying passengers, take the appropriate number of EPOSs out of
       the helmet bag and pre-position near each passenger seat. EPOSs will be distributed and
       their use demonstrated before departure.
       6.27.1.3. Aircrew members will comply with the oxygen requirements in AFI 11-202V3.
       6.27.1.4. Crewmembers occupying a crew station will have an oxygen mask connected
       and readily available for use from before engine start until engine shutdown.
   6.27.2. Rafts. On overwater flights, carry a life raft when the planned cruising altitude
   exceeds glide distance to land using a ration of approximately 2 miles per 1000 feet (12:1
   glide ratio). For example, if planned cruising altitude is FL360, a life raft would be required
   if flying more than 72 miles from land.
   6.27.3. Life preserver units (LPUs) or Personal Floatation Device. An aircrew member will
   ensure an LPU is within easy reach of each passenger and aircrew member before takeoff on
   overwater flights (outside gliding distance to land). Ensure the appropriate number and type
   of life preservers are aboard for overwater missions carrying children and infants.
   6.27.4. Anti-exposure suit. Anti-exposure suits will no longer be pre-positioned on AMC
   aircraft. Any unit scheduled to conduct operations above 78 degrees North or below 60
   degrees South (IAW federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 135 Section 135.98, operations
   in the polar area and far part 121, Appendix P, requirements for ETOPS and polar
   operations) will configure the aircraft with the appropriate quantity of anti-exposure suits
   prior to mission execution.
6.28. Fleet Service. Ensure the required fleet service items are aboard the aircraft early enough
to permit inventory prior to engine start.
6.29. Passenger Handling and Cargo Documentation. Reference Chapter 13.
   6.29.1. Passenger Briefing. Use to complete passenger briefing as directed by MAJCOM.
   Follow MAJCOM guidance for posting briefing. This briefing may be placed in a MAJCOM
   approved flimsy.
       6.29.1.1. Passenger briefings will emphasize proper hand placement during activation of
       the EPOS.

      6.29.1.2. Demonstration of onboard Aircrew Life Sustaining Equipment (ALSE) is
      required for all missions carrying passengers. Crews will ensure a demonstration kit is
      available prior to departure.
      6.29.1.3. The baggage runner should be used whenever baggage/cargo is being loaded or
      downloaded from the aft cargo compartment. Use of runner protects the passenger seats
      from damage during the loading process.
6.30. Airlifting Hazardous Cargo.
   6.30.1. AMCH 11-214, AMC Aircrew Hazardous Material Handbook, contains a description
   of the types and classes of hazardous cargo that may be carried. AMC and AMC-gained
   PICs are responsible for ensuring that all procedures contained in AMCH 11-214 are
   complied with when airlifting hazardous cargo.
      6.30.1.1. For more information regarding hazardous materials, refer to AFMAN 24-204,
      Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipment.

      6.30.2.1. Enter "Hazardous Cargo" and the mission identifier or flight number in the
      appropriate section of the flight plan. Use Remarks section of DD175, Military Flight
      Plan, and Other Information section of DD1801, International Flight Plan. Refer to the
      FCG for country specific requirements concerning over-flight when transporting
      hazardous materials cargo.
      6.30.2.2. If possible, plan the flight to minimize overflying heavily populated or
      otherwise critical areas. Approach, landing, and takeoff tracks are excluded.
      6.30.2.3. Prepare a departure message at stations when a C2 center is not available. The
      remarks section of the departure message will include: Class of hazardous material, DoD
      class or division for explosives, net explosive weight (NEW), and gross weight. If
      required, request special handling (e.g., isolated parking, security, technical escort teams,
      etc.).
      6.30.2.4. If estimated time en route (ETE) is less than 1 hour, or if other circumstances
      preclude timely message receipt at destination, notify the next destination of the ETA and
      information listed in paragraph 6.30.2.3. If available, C2 will relay required information
      to next destination.
   6.30.3. C-21 aircraft are authorized to transport the following hazardous materials prepared
   and packaged IAW AFMAN 24-204, Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air
   Shipment.

Very Important Part (VVIP), Forward Supply System (FSS) Shipments, and Courier
Material.
   6.31.1. MICAP, VVIP, sensitive cargo, courier materials, and registered mail moving within
   the normal airlift system are receipted at the on and offload stations using the air cargo
   manifest. For unit moves operated in accordance with Defense Transportation Regulation
   (DTR), Part III, Mobility, classified or sensitive cargo movement is normally manifested
   utilizing the DD Form 1385, Cargo Manifest, or similar automated product (such as CALM
   or AALPS), and will normally be accompanied by a unit courier. However, if
   classified/sensitive unit cargo is offered without an accompanying courier, the DD Form
   1907, Signature Tally Record, must be used.
      6.31.1.1. Defense Courier Service (DCS) couriers coordinating with the PIC are
      authorized to designate officer or enlisted (E-5 and above) crewmembers on military
      aircraft as couriers to escort and safeguard courier material when other qualified
      personnel are not available. Qualified passengers, if carried, are designated before
      designating crewmembers. The following restrictions apply:
          6.31.1.1.1. Primary crewmembers will not be designated couriers without the consent
          of the PIC.
          6.31.1.1.2. Crewmembers on aircraft scheduled to make an extended en route stop at
          a location where DCS couriers cannot provide en route support will not be designated
          as couriers.
   6.31.2. During stops at en route locations supported by DCS stations, DCS couriers are
   required to meet designated couriers, guard and protect the material.
 82                                                     AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


       6.31.2.1. During unscheduled en route stops crewmembers may place courier material in
       temporary custody of the following agencies in descending order of priority.

AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                83


   6.36.1. In-flight harassment or hostile action against aircraft. Aircraft subjected to
   harassment or hostile action by foreign aircraft will immediately contact the nearest USAF
   air and ground voice facility and report the encounter. Include aircraft nationality, type,
   insignia, or any other identifying features; note position, heading, time, speed when harassed,
   and the type of harassment. Request relay of the report to the nearest C2 agency. Also,
   attempt to contact the nearest command post when in UHF and VHF range.
   6.36.2. Other incidents will be reported as indicated in AFMAN10-206, Operational
   Reporting.
6.37. Communications.
   6.37.1. Crews should conduct an HF radio ground check before takeoff if use of the HF
   radio may be required for ATC or C2 communications. Attempt to establish HF contact
   before going out of UHF/VHF range. If unable to establish HF contact with the controlling
   HF station, and an alternate means of relay of ATC information is not available, the aircraft
   should return to the nearest suitable support base.
   6.37.1.1. If all communications are lost with ATC, follow procedures in the FIH and AFTTP
   3-3.38A Combat Aircraft Fundamentals (C-21).
   6.37.2. Pilots shall provide ARTCC position and weather observations when required. If
   unable to contact an ATC agency, attempt to relay through the GLOBAL HF stations.
6.38. In-flight Emergency Procedures. The PIC shall report deviations from directives that
may occur as a result of an emergency according to AFI 11-202V3. Time and conditions
permitting, inform passengers of the situation and intentions.
   6.38.1. Notification of C2 Agencies. When practical after completing the aircraft emergency
   action checklists and associated actions, the PIC shall furnish ATC and appropriate C2
   agencies with a description of the difficulty, assistance required, intentions, and any other
   pertinent information.
   6.38.2. The PIC may initiate a CONFERENCE HOTEL/SKYHOOK when additional
   expertise is necessary. Communications procedures are as follow:
      6.38.2.1. Local Area. Use appropriate UHF or VHF frequencies.
      6.38.2.2. En route. Attempt to establish a phone patch with the nearest or controlling C2
      Center using global HF network, UHF/VHF stations, SATCOM, etc. If unable, aircrews
      are permitted to use ARINC radio service as an additional avenue for phone patch
      connectivity.
      6.38.2.3. Provide the following information when time permits:
          6.38.2.3.1. Description of the situation to include actions taken and intentions.
          6.38.2.3.2. What assistance is being requested.
          6.38.2.3.3. Fuel on board and hours of endurance.
          6.38.2.3.4. Position.
          6.38.2.3.5. Altitude and flight conditions.
          6.38.2.3.6. Number of personnel and DVs on board.

6.39. Need for Medical Assistance. When a person aboard the aircraft requires medical care,
the PIC will notify the station of intended landing in sufficient time so the aircraft may be met by
medical personnel. Notification will include the patient‘s sex, approximate age, and major
complaint.
6.40. Weather Forecasts. It is the pilot‘s responsibility to obtain destination weather prior to
descent. The primary sources are 618 TACC weather operations, OWSs, and USAF weather
flights via pilot-to-meteorologist service (PMSV) or through a USAF aeronautical station. For
aircraft flying in EUCOM AOR (ENAME operations) contact USAFE/OWS at Sembach AB
GE. SOUTHCOM AOR contact 612 SPTS/WX at Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ. The ATC system
can provide weather information to en route aircraft.

Section 6F—Arrival

6.41. Descent. Prior to the top of descent (TOD), the PIC will identify and discuss mitigation of
associated hazards to the penetration, approach, landing, and airfield. Before descent into
unfamiliar areas, pilots will review appropriate terrain charts to increase aircrew situational
awareness of obstructions. Primary crewmembers will not be involved in duties other than
aircraft operations, descent and approach monitoring, and required checklist items from the
initial descent point to landing.
   6.41.1. Night and Marginal Weather Operations. Fly a precision approach, if available, at
   night or during marginal weather. If a precision approach is not available, fly any available
   approved instrument approach. A visual approach may be flown during night VFR
   conditions if an approved straight-in instrument approach to the landing runway is not
   available or operational missions require a tactical approach. NOTE: For AMC aircrews, a
   visual glide slope indicator, VASI, PAPI, etc., is required.
       6.41.1.1. On training/evaluation flights, pilots may fly non-precision approaches or VFR
       traffic patterns (including Tactical Arrivals and Departures (TAAD)) to accomplish
       required training and evaluations. The pilot monitoring will monitor a precision approach
       when practical to enhance safety.
       6.41.1.2. For recovery at home station, pilots may elect to fly a visual or non-precision
       approach, if weather minimums permit.
6.42. Instrument Approach Procedures.
   6.42.1. Aircraft category. The C-21 is a Category "C" aircraft. If approach speeds exceed
   140 KIAS, use Category "D" approach minimums.
   6.42.2. Prior to starting an instrument approach, pilots will confirm their aircraft can comply
   with the missed approach climb gradient requirements established in AFI 11-202V3.
   6.42.3. Weather minimums. Before starting an instrument approach, or beginning an en
   route descent, pilots will confirm the existing weather is reported to be:
       6.42.3.1. At or above required visibility for straight-in or sidestep approaches.
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                            85


         6.42.3.1.1. For PAR approaches, visibility will be no lower than RVR 2400 (730
         meters) or 1/2 mile visibility (800 meters) with no RVR readout available.
     6.42.3.2. At or above required ceiling and visibility for circling approaches.
         6.42.3.2.1. For circling approaches with no published ceiling requirement, the
         required ceiling shall be computed by taking the published HAA plus 100 feet
         rounded up to the next one hundred foot value. (For example, if the HAA is 747 feet,
         add 100 feet to get 847 feet and then round up to the next one hundred foot value
         which would be 900 feet. Ceiling for the approach must be at or above 900 feet.)
         When circling minimums are published, but not by category, circling approach
         minimums will be as published, but in no case lower than 600 feet and 2 miles
         visibility.
     6.42.3.3. Increase the published visibility minimums of an instrument approach by ½
     SM or as noted in NOTAMs, on ATIS, or on the approach plate, when the runway
     approach lighting system (ALS) is inoperative. (This applies only to the ALS itself, not
     to VASIs, PAPIs, and other lights that are not a component of the ALS. Reference FIH
     section B for more ALS information.)
     6.42.3.4. If the ceiling is below the value depicted for published DoD or NACO
     precision approach, but visibility is at or above authorized minimums, the PIC will
     comply with fuel requirements before initiating en route descent, penetration, or
     approach.
  6.42.4. Flight Instrumentation Requirements.
     6.42.4.1. Full flight instrumentation for a Category I ILS, for the pilot flying the
     approach, consists of an attitude indicator (ADI), a course deviation indicator (CDI), a
     means to identify the NAVAID (either aurally or by verifying the correct station
     identifier on the DME indicator), complete differential pressure instruments, and
     heading/compass systems.
     6.42.4.2. Full flight instrumentation for a precision approach radar (PAR), for the pilot
     flying the approach, consists of complete differential pressure instruments,
     heading/compass systems, and an attitude indicator.
  6.42.5. Category I ILS Procedures. Decision height for precision approaches will be as
  published, but no lower than 200 feet height above touchdown (HAT).
     6.42.5.1. ILS Precision Runway Monitor (PRM) Approaches. Both pilots must be
     certified to conduct an ILS/PRM approach. Refer to AFI 11-2C-21V1 for certification
     procedures. Comply with the following operational procedures:
         6.42.5.1.1. Two operational VHF communication radios are required.
         6.42.5.1.2. The approach must be briefed as an ILS/PRM approach.
         6.42.5.1.3. If unable to accept an ILS PRM approach clearance, contact the FAA
         ATCSCC at 1-800-333-4286 prior to departure time to obtain a pre-coordinated
         arrival time. Pilots who arrive at a PRM airport unable to accept PRM approach
         clearance, which did not contact ATC prior to departure, should expect an ATC
         directed divert to a non-PRM airport.
 86                                                 AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


          6.42.5.1.4. All breakouts from the approach shall be hand flown. Autopilots shall be
          disengaged when a breakout is directed.
          6.42.5.1.5. Should a TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA) be received, the pilot shall
          immediately respond to the RA. If following an RA requires deviating from an ATC
          clearance, the pilot shall advise ATC as soon as practical. While following an RA,
          comply with the turn portion of the ATC breakout instruction unless the pilot
          determines safety to be a factor.

   6.42.10. After Beginning Descent or Approach. IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 3 Chapter 8, after
   beginning an enroute descent or published approach, and the weather is reported or observed
   to be below approach minimums, the PIC has the option of continuing the approach to the
   missed approach point (MAP)/DH. Comply with the last assigned clearance until a new or
   amended clearance is received.
       6.42.10.1. Do not continue the approach below minimums unless the runway
       environment is in sight and the aircraft is in a position to make a safe landing.
       6.42.10.2. If the approach is continued, sufficient fuel must be available to complete the
       approach and missed approach, and proceed to a suitable alternate with normal fuel
       reserve.
       6.42.10.3. The PIC has final responsibility for determining when the destination is below
       designated minimums, and for initiating proper clearance request.
   6.42.11. Holding. An aircraft may hold at a destination that is below landing minimums, but
   forecast to improve to or above minimums provided:
       6.42.11.1. The aircraft has more fuel remaining than that required to fly to the alternate
       and hold for the appropriate holding time, and the weather at the alternate is forecast to
       remain at or above alternate filing minimums for the period, including the holding time.
       6.42.11.2. Destination weather is forecast to be at or above minimums before excess fuel
       will be consumed.
6.43. Not used.
6.44. Unscheduled Landings. (Not applicable for USAFE & PACAF) When an unscheduled
landing or crew rest occurs at a base without a passenger facility, the PIC should immediately
advise the appropriate C2 agency and request assistance in arranging substitute airlift for
passengers onboard.
6.45. Maintenance. Complete the AFTO Form 781 after each flight. After landing,
crewmembers debrief maintenance personnel on the condition of the aircraft, engines, avionics
equipment, and all installed special equipment as required. At stations without maintenance
support, when a maintenance requirement exists, the PIC will ensure a thorough debrief is
provided to the C2 agency.
   6.45.1. An entry will be placed in AFTO 781A, "Aircraft Subjected to Salt Spray" (state
   lowest altitude and duration) anytime the aircraft is flown under 1000 feet above sea except
   for takeoffs and landings.
6.46. Border Clearance.
   6.46.1. Normal Operations.
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                              89


     6.46.1.1. The unit dispatching the mission is normally responsible for the border
     clearance of its aircraft.
     6.46.1.2. When support is not available, border clearance is the responsibility of the PIC.
     Duties may be assigned to ground personnel, but the PIC retains ultimate responsibility.
     When a C-21 aircraft is onloaded at a base without an air traffic function, the PIC is
     responsible for ensuring the following:
         6.46.1.2.1. Crewmembers, troops, and passengers possess current passports and valid
         visas, when required.
         6.46.1.2.2. Crewmembers, troops, and passengers have current certificates of
         immunization (shot record).
         6.46.1.2.3. Cargo entry documents are in proper order.
         6.46.1.2.4. Departing or entering the United States through a location where border
         clearance can be obtained.
         6.46.1.2.5. Obtaining border clearance for aircraft cargo, passengers, crew and
         baggage, if required, before takeoff to a foreign area or after arrival from a foreign
         area.
         6.46.1.2.6. Spraying the aircraft (see the FCG and Paragraph 6.47).
  6.46.2. Procedures for US Entry.
     6.46.2.1. En route, the PIC will distribute personal customs declarations (when not
     accomplished by passenger services) to all passengers, troops, and crewmembers. A pilot
     will also brief passengers and crewmembers on customs regulations, and prepare and
     compile necessary border clearance forms for the PIC‘s signature.
     6.46.2.2. En route, notify the C2 agency at the base of intended landing of any change in
     ETA to ensure that border clearance is accomplished as soon as possible after landing.
     6.46.2.3. Obtain a permit to proceed when military necessities require that an aircraft,
     which has landed in the United States for customs clearance, to proceed to another base
     in the US to obtain border clearance. The permit to proceed delays customs inspection of
     cargo, passengers, and crew until arrival at the offload station, and saves intermediate
     offloading and reloading normally required for customs inspection. The permit to
     proceed is valid only to the airport of next landing where the border clearance must be
     completed or a new permit to proceed issued by a customs official. Do not make
     intermediate stops between the issue point of the permit to proceed and destination of
     manifested cargo unless required by an emergency or directed by the controlling C2
     center.
     6.46.2.4. When an aircraft lands for a US border clearance, a US Customs representative
     normally will meet the aircraft to obtain the required documents. Do not deplane
     passengers, troops, or crewmembers unless necessary for safety or the preservation of life
     and property. Do not unload until approved by customs and agriculture personnel or their
     designated representatives. This procedure applies to the initial landing in the US and all
     landings required when operating on a permit to proceed or until all crew, passengers,
     and cargo complete final border clearance.

  6.46.3. Inspections of U.S. Aircraft by Foreign Officials.
     6.46.3.1. Follow USAF policy on status of military aircraft as stated in the FCG. In
     substance, this policy holds that US military aircraft are immune from searches, seizures,
     and inspections (including customs and safety inspections) by foreign officials. In
     addition, PICs must be aware of, and adhere to, any specific FCG provisions for
     individual countries.
     6.46.3.2. If confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should use
     the following procedures.
         6.46.3.2.1. In most cases, search attempts may be halted simply by a statement of the
         PIC to the foreign official that the aircraft is a sovereign instrumentality not subject to
         search without consent of USAF headquarters or the US Department of State officials
         in the country concerned. This should be clearly conveyed in a polite manner so as
         not to offend foreign authorities that may honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have
         authority to search USAF aircraft.
         6.46.3.2.2. If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, the PIC should make
         every effort to delay the search until he or she can contact USAF headquarters
         (through MAJCOM C2) or the appropriate embassy officials. The PIC should then
         notify these agencies of foreign request by the most expeditious means available and
         follow their instructions.
         6.46.3.2.3. If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, pending
         notification to USAF headquarters or the appropriate embassy, the PIC should
         indicate that he or she would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel, flying
         time, and mechanical considerations permit a safe flight) and request permission to do
         so.
         6.46.3.2.4. If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their
         way on board an aircraft, the PIC should state that he protests the course of action
         being pursued and that he intends to notify both USAF headquarters and the
         appropriate American embassy of the foreign action. The PIC should not attempt
         physical resistance, and should thereafter report the incident to USAF headquarters
         and appropriate embassy as soon as possible. The PIC should escort foreign
         authorities if the inspection cannot be avoided.
     6.46.3.3. Other procedures may apply when carrying sensitive cargo or equipment.
     Follow these procedures and applicable portions of classified FCG supplements.
  6.46.4. Exercises and Contingency Operations.
     6.46.4.1. General. Certain airlift missions, which do not transit normal ports of entry or
     exit, require special procedures to expedite compliance with customs, public health,
     immunization, and agricultural requirements. A joint memorandum of understanding,
     between these agencies and MAJCOM establishes certain procedures and waivers.
     6.46.4.2. Implementation. Implementation of the agreement is not automatic. Traffic
     and border clearing agencies implement all or part of the agreement as necessary for each
     operation. Inspection and clearance may be accomplished at the US onload or offload
     base, or at the foreign onload or offload base.

     6.46.4.3. Customs Procedures.
        6.46.4.3.1. Outbound: No requirement. Filing of Customs Form 7507, General
        Declaration (Outward/Inward), is not required unless directed.
        6.46.4.3.2. Inbound. Prepare one copy of the following documents before arrival:
            6.46.4.3.2.1. Customs Form 7507 (Passenger list not required).
            6.46.4.3.2.2. Cargo manifest.
            6.46.4.3.2.3. For troops out of country less than 140 days:
               6.46.4.3.2.3.1. Troop commander's certificate for examination of troop
               baggage.
               6.46.4.3.2.3.2. One copy of the US Customs Baggage Declaration Form for
               each passenger not under command of the troop commander, to include
               observers, support personnel, civilians, news reporters, and crewmembers.
               6.46.4.3.2.3.3. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a customs
               representative will meet the aircraft and accept the troop commander's
               certificate with respect to troop baggage. Individual baggage declarations are
               not required. The troop commander should have inspected troop baggage.
               6.46.4.3.2.3.4. Troops will debark under the observation of the customs
               representative with only a spot check of articles and baggage. The customs
               officer may elect to make a more extensive inspection.
            6.46.4.3.2.4. For troops who are out of the country 140 days or more:
               6.46.4.3.2.4.1. One copy of the U.S. Customs Baggage Declaration Form for
               each passenger. This includes observers, support personnel, civilians, news
               media personnel, and crewmembers. Personnel may use DD Form 1854,

              milk, milk products, vegetables, plants, plant pests, soil samples, animals, meat,
              and animal products can be brought into the United States. All items of troop
              personal gear/cargo are to be cleaned of mud, dirt, sand, and other foreign
              material before being brought aboard the aircraft. Personal gear and equipment
              must be examined for snails and other plant pests to prevent their accidental entry
              into the U.S.
              6.46.4.6.2.2. Before loading, the command responsible for cargo being airlifted
              will clear vehicles and cargo of snails or other plant pests and of all mud and soil.
              6.46.4.6.2.3. When required by agricultural quarantine regulations, the FCG, or
              higher headquarters, the aircraft will receive an aerosol treatment 30 minutes
              before landing.
              6.46.4.6.2.4. On arrival, agricultural inspectors will inspect the aircraft after
              troops have disembarked. Crewmembers will assemble remains of in-flight
              lunches for prompt removal by fleet service personnel.
              6.46.4.6.2.5. Inspectors examine baggage, equipment, vehicles, and cargo as
              offloaded. Any items, vehicles, or cargo found to be contaminated will be held
              for such treatment as the inspector may direct (washing, steam cleaning, physical
              cleaning, or fumigation).
   6.46.5. Military Customs Pre-clearance Inspection Program. All crewmembers will ensure
   compliance with Military Customs Pre-clearance requirements.
6.47. Insect and Pest Control.
   6.47.1. Responsibility. PICs will ensure required spraying is accomplished according to
   AFJI 48-104, Quarantine Regulations of the Armed Forces, Department of Defense FCG, or
   as directed by higher headquarters. Certify the spraying on Customs Form 7507, or on forms
   provided by the country transited. Aircraft should never be sprayed with passengers on
   board. The only exception is when mandated by the FCG.
       6.47.1.1. When spraying is required, use insecticide, aerosol d-phenothrin-2 percent,
       National Stock Number (NSN) 6840-01-067-6674 (or equivalent), to spray the aircraft.

           6.47.1.1.3. Spray the cabin, cockpit, and other spaces accessible from within the
           aircraft after the crew is aboard and after closing all doors, windows, hatches, and
           ventilation openings. CAUTION: If the insecticide label directs disembarkation after
           use, spray before boarding crew or passengers. Close all doors and hatches for 10
           minutes after dispensing and ventilate for 15 minutes before allowing anyone on
           board.
       6.47.1.2. Spray for 105 seconds unless longer periods are specified for the country being
       transited. NOTE: Keep used aerosol cans separate from other trash so they may be
       disposed of safely.
   6.47.2. Responsibility of PIC In-flight. When seeing any insect or rodent infestation of the
   aircraft in-flight, notify the destination C2 center, airfield management operations, or airport
   manager of the situation before landing so the proper authorities can meet the aircraft.
   6.47.3. Procedure at Aerial Port of Disembarkation (APOD). On arrival at an APOD, do not
   open cargo doors or hatches except to enplane officials required to inspect the aircraft for
   insect or rodent infestation. Do not onload or offload cargo or passengers until the inspection
   is satisfactorily completed. This procedure may be altered to satisfy mission or local
   requirements, as arranged by the base air terminal manager or the local C2 organization.

       change.
       6.50.4.3. Advise the PIC and determine whether the missing equipment should be
       recovered or replaced before mission continuation.
       6.50.4.4. Assist, as required, in preparing reports of survey for missing equipment.
       6.50.4.5. When possible, advise HQ AMC/A3TL (or MAJCOM Aircrew Flight
       Equipment office) and appropriate C2 agency (or airport management) before mission
       continuation.
   6.50.5. Additional Equipment. If more equipment is discovered during the preflight than is
   annotated on the AF Form 4076 or AFTO Form 46, annotate the total quantity in the next
   vacant column for the item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is entered above the check
   number of that column.
6.51. Passenger Restrictions.
   6.51.1. No-show passenger baggage or baggage of passengers removed from flight will be
   downloaded prior to departure.
6.52. Airfield Data Reports. Aircrews transiting unfamiliar airfields or airfields where
conditions may adversely affect subsequent flight will:
   6.52.1. Report airfield characteristics that produce illusions, such as runway length, width,
   slope, and lighting, as compared to standard runways, sloping approach terrain, runway
   contrast against surrounding terrain, haze, glare, etc. and previously unknown obstacles,
   airfield markings, or other safety critical items to HQ AMC/A3AS (Airfield Suitability
   Branch).
   6.52.2. Debrief the next C2 center transited.
6.53. Impoundment of Aircraft. If an aircraft is involved in a serious in-flight incident, the
PIC should impound the aircraft immediately after landing IAW AFI 21-10, and contact the
controlling C2 agency for further instructions.
6.54. Wake Turbulence Avoidance. Comply with wake turbulence avoidance criteria.
Acceptance of traffic information, instructions to follow an aircraft, or a visual approach

AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                95


responsibility of providing wake turbulence separation. Refer to FLIP General Planning (GP) for
more information concerning wake turbulence separation.
6.55. Overflying En Route Stops. The C2 agency may approve a request to overfly a
scheduled en route stop (ANG/A3O for ANG-directed missions).
6.56. Classified Equipment and Material. Comply with the following or as directed in
MAJCOM supplement.
   6.56.1. Equipment. When classified equipment is onboard, ensure the C2 center or base
   operations office is aware of the requirement for aircraft security according to Chapter 7 of
   this AFI. At bases not under jurisdiction of the Air Force, ensure the aircraft and equipment
   are protected. AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management, provides specific
   guidance concerning the security of various levels of classified equipment aboard aircraft.
   For classified aircraft components which cannot be removed and stored, lock the aircraft. If
   available, use Ravens to guard the aircraft; otherwise, use guards employed by the host
   country for flightline/airport area control. Do not leave unguarded classified information
   stored in navigation or radio equipment.
   6.56.2. Material. Ensure Communication Security (COMSEC) and other classified materials
   are turned in at destination and receipts are obtained for COMSEC and classified material.
   The on-site C2 center will provide temporary storage for COMSEC and other classified
   materials during en route, turnaround, and crew rest stops. If a storage facility is not
   available, the aircraft gun storage box may be used for material classified up to and including
   SECRET. Encrypted COMSEC will only be transferred to authorized DoD personnel.
       6.56.2.1. Remain overnight (RON) COMSEC Storage – Refer to AFI 33-201,
       Communications Security (COMSEC), for additional guidance. Every effort should be
       made to store classified material in a secure facility (i.e. Base Ops/Command Post) if that
       facility exists. If remaining overnight at a location that does not or cannot provide this
       storage capability, then the following procedures should be used:
          6.56.2.1.1. If carrying a CYZ-10, the key for the CYZ-10 will be removed and
          carried at all times with one of the pilots. Place the CYZ-10 somewhere on the jet not
          in plain view (i.e. under a seat, in a closet, in the baggage compartment.
          6.56.2.1.2. If using a KOI-18 or KYK-13, the entire device may be placed in its
          sealable/tamper resistant pouch and placed in the gun box. The pouch will be locked
          and the key will be kept on the aircrew member. Place the pouch in the gun box.
          6.56.2.1.3. All classified documents (authenticators, SPINS extracts, etc) will be
          folded and locked in the gun box. There should be room on the top shelf of the gun
          box above the location for the gun and ammo clip. The key to the gun box will also
          be carried at all times with one of the pilots. The aircraft will then be locked,
          including the emergency exit. Upon return to the aircraft, crews must inspect the
          aircraft and documents for tampering and report any suspected or possible
          compromise immediately, even if it delays the mission. This guidance is in
          agreement with AFI 31-401 and AFI 33-201,Communication Security (COMSEC).
   6.56.3. Aircrews will ensure that they have an operable Mode 4 when required for mission
   accomplishment. Aircrews will conduct an operational ground test of the Mode 4 (ground
 96                                                    AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


   test assets permitting) before deployment overseas, or as specified in the OPORD or
   contingency/exercise tasking.
   6.56.4. Attempt to fix an inoperable Mode 4 before takeoff. Do not delay takeoff nor cancel
   a mission for an inoperable Mode 4, except when the aircraft will transit an area where safe
   passage procedures are implemented.
   6.56.5. Conduct an in-flight check of the Mode 4 on all missions departing the CONUS for
   overseas locations. Aircrews can request the Mode 4 interrogation check through North
   American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) on UHF frequency 364.2.
   6.56.6. Aircraft with inoperable Mode 4 will continue to their intended destinations. Repairs
   will be accomplished at the first destination where equipment, parts, and maintenance
   technicians are available. In theaters where safe passage is implemented, aircraft will follow
   procedures for inoperable Mode 4 as directed in the applicable Airspace Control Order
   (ACO).
   6.56.7. Ground and in-flight checks of the Mode 4, when conducted, are mandatory
   maintenance debrief items. Crews will annotate successful and unsuccessful interrogation of
   the Mode 4 on all aircraft forms (AFTO Form 781A).
   6.56.8. Aircrews will carry COMSEC equipment and documents required to operate the
   Mode 4 on missions when required for mission accomplishment. Before departing for any
   destination without COMSEC storage facilities, crews will contact their local COMSEC
   managers for guidance.
6.57. High Altitude Airfield Operations. NOTE: The following procedure is for operations at
airfields from approximately 8,000 feet pressure altitude up to 10,000 feet pressure altitude.
Reference the Pressurization System description in Section I, and Emergency Procedures in
Section III, of T.O. 1C-21A-1 for further information.
   6.57.1. Passengers. Passengers should be given a thorough briefing on the pressurization
   abnormalities to expect on arrival and departure. With these procedures, rapid changes in the
   cabin pressure will be experienced. Passengers should be briefed on how to clear their ears
   and warned of problems that may be encountered if they have sinus congestion. They should
   also expect a large volume of noise and hot air if the pressure altitude at the field is greater
   than 9,250 feet.
   6.57.2. Engine Start and Taxi. Engine start should be accomplished with the Pressurization
   Automatic-Manual Switch in MAN. Engine start should be normal at pressure altitudes
   below 9,250 feet. For engine starts above 9,250 feet pressure altitude, start the engines with
   the Bleed Air Switches OFF to prevent emergency airflow into the cabin. N1 and N2 idle
   RPM indications will be higher. Cabin air should be turned ON normally during the Taxi
   Checklist.
   6.57.3. Takeoff.
       6.57.3.1. Pressure altitude less than 9,250 feet: Takeoff with the pressurization system in
       the manual mode, cabin air ON, and the Bleed Air Switches ON. The Cabin Altitude
       light will be on above approximately 8,500 feet pressure altitude. After liftoff, the
       copilot should raise the gear upon command of the pilot. Simultaneously, with the other
       hand, the copilot should use the Up/Dn Manual Control Switch to decrease the cabin
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                 97


     altitude to below 7,200 feet and return the pressurization system to automatic mode by
     placing the Automatic-Manual Switch to AUTO.
     6.57.3.2. Pressure altitude greater than 9,250 feet: Takeoff with the pressurization
     system in the manual mode, cabin air ON, and the Bleed Air Switches OFF. The Cabin
     Altitude light will be on. Pressurization will have to be reestablished after airborne.
     After liftoff, the copilot should raise the gear upon command of the pilot.
     Simultaneously, with the other hand, the copilot should turn the Right Bleed Air Switch
     ON and use the Up/Dn Manual Control Switch to decrease the cabin altitude to below
     9,500 feet. Recycle the Right Bleed Air Switch from ON to OFF and then back to ON to
     reset the Emergency Pressurization Valves. Continue to decrease the cabin altitude to
     below 7,200 feet and return the pressurization system to automatic mode by placing the
     Automatic-Manual Switch to AUTO. Turn the Left Bleed Air Switch ON.
  6.57.4. Approach. Set the Cabin Controller to its maximum and place the Pressurization
  Auto-Manual Switch to manual prior to landing. Use the Up/Dn Manual Control Switch to
  raise the cabin altitude to field elevation. If landing at or above 9,500 feet pressure altitude,
  turn OFF the Bleed Air Switches to prevent emergency airflow.
  6.57.5. Landing. Follow normal landing procedures. At touchdown, expect the primary
  outflow valve to fully open and dump any remaining pressure. During the After Landing
  Checklist, turn the Cabin Air Switch OFF in the normal sequence. The Cabin Safety Valve
  will open and further ensure that the cabin is unpressurized before opening the door.

                                            Chapter 7

                                    AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on aircraft security and preventing and resisting
aircraft piracy (hijacking) of the C-21 aircraft. AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft
Piracy (Hijacking), AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense (FOUO), FAA Notice (FAAN) 7110.422,
Aircraft Hijack and Suspicious Inflight Activities - Response and Notification Procedures, and
specific MAJCOM security publications contain additional guidance. Aircrews will not release
information concerning hijacking attempts or identify armed aircrew members or missions to the
public.
7.2. Security. The C-21 is a ―Protection Level 4‖ resource. Aircraft security at non-United
States military installations is the responsibility of the controlling agency.
7.3. Integrated Defense. The following security procedures will implement AFI 31-101,
requirements for C-21 aircraft:
   7.3.1. The aircraft will be parked in an established restricted area and afforded protection
   IAW AFI 31-101. When the DV is a Code 4 (3-star general or civilian equivalent) or above,
   follow these procedures.
       7.3.1.1. Parking Locations. Park DV aircraft in a prominent area so maintenance
       personnel and security forces patrols can closely monitor them.
       7.3.1.2. Notification Procedures. Establish procedures to inform security forces of the
       arrival, parking arrangements, and departure of all DV aircraft.
   7.3.2. Not used.
   7.3.3. At non-United States military installations, the PIC determines the adequacy of local
   security capabilities to provide aircraft security commensurate with this chapter. If he or she
   determines security to be inadequate, the aircraft will depart to a station where adequate
   security is available.
   7.3.4. The security force must be made aware of all visits to the aircraft. The security force
   POC must be identified to the PIC.
   7.3.5. Locking and Sealing. Lock the aircraft, including the tailcone access door, during a
   ―Remain over night‖ (RON) on non-secure ramps (see paragraph 7.5.1.).
7.4. Not used.
7.5. En Route Security. The planning agency must coordinate with the execution agency to
ensure adequate en route security is available. PIC will receive a threat assessment and en route
security capability evaluation briefing for areas of intended operation prior to home station
departure and should request updates from en route C2 as required. If required, a PHOENIX
RAVEN team will be assigned to the mission.
   7.5.1. The PHOENIX RAVEN team will consist of two US Air Force security force
   members, but may include more depending on security requirements. The team's travel
   status is determined by MAJCOM. The team travels in MEP status and is responsible to the
   PIC at all times. In turn, the PIC is responsible for its welfare (transportation, lodging, etc.).
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                  99


   Ensure security team members receive a mission briefing, aircraft egress/passenger briefing
   (as appropriate).
   7.5.2. Arrival. On arrival, the PIC will assess the local situation and take the following
   actions as required:
      7.5.2.1. Area patrol. Request area security patrols from local security forces. If local
      authorities request payment for this service, use SF 44.
      7.5.2.2. Aircrew surveillance. During short ground times, direct armed crew members to
      remain with the aircraft and maintain surveillance of aircraft entrances and activities in
      the aircraft vicinity.
      7.5.2.3. Inadequate Security. If, in the opinion of the PIC, airfield security is inadequate
      and the PIC determines the safety of the aircraft is in question, the PIC may waive the
      FDP limits and crew rest requirements and depart as soon as possible for a base
      considered reliable. Report movement and intentions to the controlling agency as soon as
      practical. If a departure is not possible, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best of
      their ability. In no case, will the entire crew leave the aircraft unattended. Crew rest
      requirements will be subordinate to aircraft security when the airframe may be at risk.
      The PIC should rotate a security detail among the crew to provide for both aircraft
      protection and crew rest until relief is available. Request security assistance from the
      nearest DoD installation, US Embassy, local military or law enforcement agencies as
      appropriate.
   7.5.3. Entry Control Procedures. Unescorted entry is granted to aircrew members and
   support personnel assigned to the mission who possess their home station AF Form 1199, Air
   Force Entry Control Card, supported by an Entry Access List (EAL) or aircrew orders.
   Aircrew members are authorized escort authority.
      7.5.3.1. Normally, non-United States nationals, such as cargo handlers, can perform their
      duties under escort and should not be placed on the EAL.
      7.5.3.2. Personnel not on the EAL or aircrew orders must be escorted within the area.
7.6. Detecting Unauthorized Entry.
   7.6.1. When parking on a secure ramp, the aircraft will normally be left unlocked/unsealed
   to allow ground personnel immediate access. If, in the PIC judgment, the aircraft needs to be
   locked in order to detect unauthorized entry, then:
      7.6.1.1. Use available aircraft ground security locking devices.
      7.6.1.2. Secure the doors in a manner that will indicate unauthorized entry (e.g., tape
      inside of doors to airframe so that entry pulls tape loose).
      7.6.1.3. Close and lock the door.
      7.6.1.4. Wipe the immediate area around lock and latches clean to aid in investigation of
      a forced entry.
      7.6.1.5. Report any unauthorized entry or tampering to the Office of Special
      Investigation (OSI), security forces or local authorities, and the C2 agency. Have aircraft
      thoroughly inspected prior to flight.
 100                                                   AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


   7.6.2. Security awareness is crucial to effective mission accomplishment. Aircrews must
   always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.
   In addition to normal preflight activities, aircrews must inspect areas of the aircraft not
   covered by normal preflight duties, to include inside inboard main landing gear doors, nose
   wheel compartment, and the aft avionics bay for unfamiliar devices. Report any suspicious
   items to host security forces. Aircrews will maintain a heightened security posture
   throughout all pre-takeoff activities.
7.7. Preventive Measures. Commanders at all levels must ensure preventive measures are
taken to minimize access to the aircraft by potential hijackers. When a C-21 is operating away
from home station, the PIC will comply with this chapter and AFI 13-207, as supplemented.
   7.7.1. Preventive measures include the following: The host station passenger processing or
   manifesting facility should conduct anti-hijacking inspections. Do not board passengers until
   the PIC is fully satisfied with inspection results. In the absence of qualified passenger
   service representatives, the PIC will ensure the anti-hijacking inspection of passengers and
   baggage is accomplished.
   7.7.2. Medical facility commanders are responsible for anti-hijacking inspection of patients.
   When patients are delivered to the aircraft by civilian sources, the aircrew will perform
   required inspections prior to loading.
   7.7.3. During exercises or contingencies in support of combat operations involving the
   movement of large groups of personnel, the unit being supported should manifest passengers
   and perform anti-hijacking inspections.
   7.7.4. Passengers will not carry weapons or ammunition on their person or in hand-carried
   baggage aboard an aircraft. EXECPTION: Special agents, guards of the Secret Service or
   State Department, RAVEN Team Members, and other individuals specifically authorized to
   carry weapons.
       7.7.4.1. Troops or deadhead crewmembers will not retain custody of ammunition on an
       aircraft. They will turn it in to the troop commander or PIC. Troops may carry unloaded
       weapons and ammunition aboard the aircraft during combat operations. When the
       tactical situation dictates (in coordination with the aircrew), weapons may be loaded at
       the order of the troop commander or team leader.
       7.7.4.2. Dummy clips that can be easily identified may be loaded for training at the order
       of the team leader in coordination with the aircrew.
       7.7.4.3. RAVENs will only be armed in-flight on specifically designated missions
       identified on the mission ―frag‖ as ―RAVEN in-flight arming required‖.
   7.7.5. If weapons must be cleared, instruct the individual(s) to:
       7.7.5.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or
       personnel before un-holstering or un-slinging their weapons.
       7.7.5.2. Clear weapons in accordance with standard safety procedures. Ensure troop/PIC
       retains ammunition IAW paragraph 7.7.4.1.
7.8. Preventing and Resisting Hijacking.
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                101


   7.8.1. The Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), has exclusive
   responsibility to direct law enforcement activity related to actual or attempted aircraft piracy
   (hijacking) in the United States. See CJCSI 3610.01A, dated 20 Jun 06.
   7.8.2. In taking action during an aircraft hijacking situation, military forces will act under
   military command within the scope of their duties.
   7.8.3. In the event an aircraft involved in an aircraft hijacking situation is carrying
   documents, equipment, or material that DoD has determined to be highly sensitive, or
   weapons of mass destruction, DoD will provide FAA, and where appropriate, the Federal
   Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with all pertinent information. Where possible, the FAA will
   consult and cooperate with DoD prior to directing any law enforcement activity.
   7.8.4. An aircraft is most vulnerable to hijacking when the aircrew is aboard and the aircraft
   is operationally ready for flight.
   7.8.5. A concerted effort must be made to prevent the hijacking of military or military
   contract aircraft by detecting potential hijackers before they board the aircraft.
   7.8.6. Should preventive efforts fail, any actual attempt to hijack a military aircraft must be
   resisted in a manner appropriate to the situation.
   7.8.7. Since air piracy may be committed by political terrorists or by individuals to whom
   the threat of death is not a deterrent but a stimulus, ordinary law enforcement procedures may
   be ineffective. Thus, successful conclusion of a hijacking situation and apprehension of the
   hijackers may require use of specialized law enforcement techniques and procedures.
   7.8.8. Delaying actions have been most successful in overcoming hijackings without loss of
   life or property.
   7.8.9. In the case of an aircraft carrying passengers, the primary concern is the safety of the
   passengers.
   7.8.10. Assistance to hijacked civil or military contract aircraft will be rendered as requested
   by the pilot in command of the aircraft and the authority exercising operational control of the
   anti-hijacking effort.
7.9. Initial Response. When an act of air piracy involves an Air Force installation or aircraft
within the United States, response will be according to the following guidelines until such time
as FAA assumes active direction of anti-hijacking efforts. Resist all attempts to hijack a military
aircraft. Resistance may vary from simple dissuasion, through deception and subterfuge, to
direct physical confrontation, including the prudent use of weapons.
   7.9.1. The following guidelines should be used to counter a hijacking, actual or threatened,
   while the aircraft is on the ground:
       7.9.1.1. Delay movement of the aircraft to provide time for ground personnel and the
       aircrew to establish communication and execute coordinated resistance actions.
       7.9.1.2. The authority for determining when ground resistance will be discontinued is
       vested in the highest available level of command. When adequate communication cannot
       be established, or when time does not permit, this authority is delegated in the following
       order:
 102                                                    AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


           7.9.1.2.1. MAJCOM commander exercising operational control of the aircraft.
           7.9.1.2.2. MAJCOM commanders in whose AOR the airfield lies.
           7.9.1.2.3. Senior operational commander on scene.
           7.9.1.2.4. PIC in compliance with MAJCOM directives.
   7.9.2. A hijacked aircraft carrying weapons of mass destruction will not be allowed to
   takeoff. Refer to DoD 5210.41M, Nuclear Weapon Security Manual, paragraph 9B(3), for
   additional guidance.
7.10. In-Flight Resistance. After airborne, success in thwarting a hijacking depends on the
resourcefulness of the aircrew. Many variables of a hijacking preclude use of any specific
counter-hijacking procedure. Some key factors should be evaluated before deciding a course of
action to be taken, including the nature of the threat, danger to life or crippling damage to the
aircraft in-flight, destination indicated by the hijacker, and the presence of sensitive material
onboard. Some counter-hijacking actions the aircrew may consider are:
   7.10.1. Engage the hijacker(s) in conversation in an attempt to calm them and to evaluate
   what course of action might be effective.
   7.10.2. Dissuade the hijacker.
   7.10.3. Use facts or subterfuge to convince the hijacker intermediate stops are necessary.
   7.10.4. Propose more favorable alternatives, such as landing in a neutral, rather than a
   hostile, country.
   7.10.5. Exploit any reasonable opportunity to incapacitate or overcome the hijacker
   physically, including the prudent use of firearms.
7.11. Communications Between Aircrew and Ground Agencies. Crews facing a hijacking
threat will transmit an in-the-clear notification of hijacking to ATC. If an in-the-clear
transmission is not possible, set transponder to 7500. If unable to set transponder, or if not under
radar control, transmit a radio message indicating transponder change to 7500. Notify ground
agencies by any means available as soon as practical and follow-up with situation reports as
circumstances permit. Covert signals are no longer to be used per FAA guidance.
7.12. Forced Penetration of Unfriendly Airspace. Refer to FIH for international signals for
air intercept.
7.13. Arming of Crew Members. When crews are directed to carry weapons, one pilot will
normally be armed. All crew members should know who is armed. The following procedures
apply when arming is directed:
   7.13.1. Weapons Issue. Before departing home station, obtain weapons, ammunition, box,
   lock and key. Crew members will be armed according to AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of
   Force by Air Force Personnel and MAJCOM publications. If an armed crew member must
   leave the crew en route, transfer the weapon to another authorized crew member using AF
   Form 1297.
   7.13.2. Wearing of Weapons. Wear weapons in a holster, concealed at all times to prevent
   identifying armed crew members. Do not wear weapons off the flight line except to and
   from the C2, armories, and other facilities associated with aircrew activities. In general, at
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                              103


   overseas locations, weapons are not to be brought off the aircraft. In countries where
   FCG/Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) authorizes such action, every effort should be
   made to keep all firearms onboard the Sovereign US vessel unless appropriately responding
   to a hostile event or being moved to/from storage at an armory. RAVEN weapons are not to
   be brought off the aircraft unless responding to hostile action or being moved to/from storage
   at an armory.
       7.13.2.1. AMC Passenger Terminal Procedures. Armed crewmembers must discreetly
       identify themselves to AMC passenger service personnel upon arrival at security
       checkpoints. One crewmember will present a valid set of crew orders, military
       identification card, and AF Form 523, USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms, authorizing
       the carrying of concealed weapons. Once terminal personnel verify this, they will allow
       the crewmember to vouch for the remaining crewmembers. The entire crew will then
       proceed through the magnetometer without removing objects from their pockets. This
       will prevent passengers from determining which crewmembers are armed.
   7.13.3. Weapons Storage In-Flight. Crew members will be armed before beginning
   preflight, on-load or off-load duties and until completion of all post-flight duties. When no
   passengers are aboard, weapons may be stored in the gun box in-flight after a satisfactory
   stowaway check. Crew members will rearm before landing. Weapons need not be unloaded
   before placing them in a gun box.
   7.13.4. Weapons Storage on the Ground.
       7.13.4.1. Aircrews, including stage crews, will store weapons and ammunition in the
       most secure facility available, normally the base armory.
       7.13.4.2. In the event a secure facility is unavailable:
           7.13.4.2.1. Non-stage aircrews may store weapons and ammunition in the aircraft
           gun box.
           7.13.4.2.2. Stage aircrews should contact C2 for guidance.
   7.13.5. When storing weapons in the gun box:
       7.13.5.1. Weapons should normally not be unloaded.
       7.13.5.2. Inform C2 which crew member has the gun box key.
   7.13.6. Crew members will ensure they are reissued the same weapon until mission
   termination at home station.
   7.13.7. Loading and Transfer of Weapons. Load and unload weapons at approved clearing
   barrels if available. Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer of loaded weapons to another crew
   member; place the weapon on a flat surface.
7.14. Force Protection. Crews must be alert to possibility of terrorist activities at all times.

8.4. AMC Form 97, AMC In-Flight Emergency and Unusual Occurrence
Worksheet. Applies to AMC and AMC-gained aircrews only. The AMC Form 97 is a tool to
notify appropriate authorities of any mishap involving crewmembers or aircraft. PICs shall
complete all appropriate areas of the form in as much detail as possible. When notified, AMC
C2 agents will inform their supervisor/commander to start investigation and reporting activities
IAW AFI 91-204 and Operation Report 3 (OPREP-3) procedures.
   8.4.1. PICs will report crewmember or passenger injury, aircraft damage, or injury/damage
   to another organization‘s people or equipment caused by PIC‘s aircraft/crewmember. At a
   minimum, report the following:
       8.4.1.1. Any physiological episode (physiological reaction, near accident, or hazard in-
       flight due to medical or physiological reasons). These include:
           8.4.1.1.1. Proven or suspected case(s) of hypoxia.
           8.4.1.1.2. Carbon monoxide poisoning or other toxic exposure.
           8.4.1.1.3. Decompression sickness due to evolved gas (bends, chokes,
           neurocirculatory collapse), or severe reaction to trapped gas that results in
           incapacitation.
           8.4.1.1.4. Hyperventilation.

           episode will see a flight surgeon as soon as practical.
       8.4.1.2. A human factors related situation, e.g. misinterpretation of instruments;
       information overload (i.e. tactile, aural, and visual input too fast to permit reasonable
       analysis/decision); aircrew task saturation (i.e. too many responses/actions required in a
       short period of time); or confused switchology (i.e. adjacent switches where actuation of
       wrong switch creates dangerous situation). Anonymous reports are acceptable.
       8.4.1.3. A condition that required engine shutdown, in-flight flameout, engine failure,

  to appropriate MAJCOM agencies. Reportable events include, but are not limited to,
  spectrum interference, interception, fuel dumping, multiple engine failure, hostile fire, injury
  to passenger or aircrew member, etc. This list is not all exhaustive. Most events require C2
  agents to forward OPREP reports to higher headquarters. In all cases, pass the ―who, what,
  when, where, why, and how‖ of the incident to a C2 agency.
     8.5.6.1. The Spectrum Interference Resolution Program, covered in AFI 10-707,
     Spectrum Interference Resolution Program, establishes procedures to combat the effect
     of meaconing, intrusion, jamming, and interference.               PICs who encounter
     electromagnetic interference (EMI) will report the event to the nearest C2 agency as soon
     as practical.

8.6. Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricants (POL) - Aviation Fuels Documentation. This section
prescribes aviation POL (AVPOL) procedures that ensure correct documentation, form and
invoice processing, and program supervision. Use the Multi Service Corporation (MSC) Air
Card for the purchase of aviation fuel and ancillary ground services at commercial airports (and
some military installations) worldwide. The Air Card is authorized for use by all U.S.
government aircraft, state, and local law enforcement aircraft, and some foreign government
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                              109


aircraft. All PICs should plan to use the ―platinum‖ MSC card. In most cases, there will be no
changes when refueling at non-Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) contract locations. The
MSC card is accepted at approximately 4,800 locations worldwide. A list of all MSC-accepting
merchants can be found at https://www.airseacard.com. It replaces the SF 44 at locations that
accept the MSC card.
   8.6.1. Responsibilities. Aircrew and maintenance personnel will be familiar with AVPOL
   procedures and documentation requirements of this chapter. Improper use of the MSC card
   could create financial liability for the purchaser.
   8.6.2. Refuel/defuel USAF aircraft at DoD locations whenever possible. If DoD service is
   not available, purchase fuel from other source(s) in the following priority:
       8.6.2.1. Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) or Canadian into-plane contracts.
       8.6.2.2. Foreign government air forces. NOTE:         DoD FLIP en route supplements
       identify locations with into-plane contracts.
   8.6.3. AVPOL Forms Documentation and Procedures.
       8.6.3.1. The DD1898, Fuel Sale Slip, is the fuel transaction receipt used for purchases at
       other DoD locations, including DESC into-plane contract locations. Log and place the
       DD1898 inside the AF Form 664, Aircraft Fuels Documenting Log. The PIC or
       designated representative shall complete this form. NOTE: If the contractor insists on a
       unique invoice along with the DD1898, annotate the vendor‘s invoice with
       ―DUPLICATE DD1898 ACCOMPLISHED.‖
       8.6.3.2. The AF Form 664, Aircraft Fuels Documenting Log is a tool to log and store all
       AVPOL transaction forms. Record all off station transactions on the front of the form
       and insert the original form inside the envelope. Turn in the AF Form 664, with
       supporting forms, to maintenance debriefing or as directed by local procedures. The PIC
       or designated representative shall complete this form when appropriate.

  AIRCREW OPERATIONS IN CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND
                 NUCLEAR THREAT ENVIRONMENT

10.1. Overview. The proliferation of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN)
weapons and the means to deliver them present serious security threats to the global operations
of air mobility forces. It is reasonable that C-21 crews could find themselves in a CBRN threat
environment in their logistics role of delivering critical cargo/personnel into or out of a
contaminated base; as a primary target due to its role of transporting distinguished visitors (DV);
or simply as part of collateral damage from a CBRN attack. This chapter describes the CBRN
threat, passive defense measures to mitigate that threat, and guidance for ground and flight
operations in a contaminated environment.
10.2. Understanding the CBRN Threat.
   10.2.1. Chemical Weapons. Militarily significant chemical weapons include nerve, blister,
   choking, and blood agents. A key point for aircrew members to remember is that time is on
   your side. The ultra-violet (UV) rays of the sun, high temperatures, and high absorption rates
   of chemicals all decrease their lethality. Most chemical agents will either evaporate or
   absorb into surfaces. For decontamination, cleaning with hot soap and water and/or a 5
   percent bleach solution currently appears to be the best and most practical method of
   removing chemical agents that may remain as a contact hazard on glass, and unpainted metal.
   Currently, the only decontaminate authorized for use on aircraft is soap and water. NOTE:
   Recent tests indicate that as a decontaminated aircraft dries, the absorbed chemical warfare
   agent (CWA) may resurface from painted surfaces causing contact and vapor hazards.
   10.2.2. Biological Weapons. Biological warfare agents (BWA) are normally divided into
   three areas: bacteria (i.e., Anthrax) that live outside the cell, reproduce, and are normally
   susceptible to antibiotics; toxins (i.e., Ricin), that are poisons produced by living organisms
   or plants; and viruses (i.e., Smallpox) that normally require the host of a living cell to survive
   and reproduce. Viruses and toxins do not respond to antibiotics. It is probable that the
   medical community would be the first to recognize that an upsurge in ―flu-like symptoms‖ is
   actually a biological attack. Although BWA are degraded by UV rays, humidity and
   high/low temperatures, some BWA (i.e., Anthrax spores) may have a long life, lasting
   decades under the right conditions. Current immunizations and good personal hygiene help
   prevent infection.
   10.2.3. Radiological Weapons. The radiation dispersal device (RDD), or so-called ―dirty
   bomb,‖ is the typical radiological weapon. RDD is any device that disseminates radioactive
   material without using a nuclear detonation. Key points to remember are that shielding and
   distance are the best defenses against radiation exposure.
   10.2.4. Nuclear Weapons. The threat from a nuclear device is from the initial blast, heat,
   and radiation. In addition, the Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) from a nuclear detonation can
   damage electronic equipment. The best protection is a combination of shielding, distance
   from the blast, and limited time of exposure.
10.3. CBRN Passive Defense Measures. Passive defense measures are those activities
conducted to negate, contain, and manage the effects of a CBRN attack. Passive defense
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                              119


measures include pre, trans, and post-attack actions designed to mitigate the CBRN threat
through contamination avoidance, protection, and contamination control.
   10.3.1. Contamination Avoidance. Contamination avoidance is the most important passive
   defense measure. Techniques for contamination avoidance include: inflight diversion,
   survival launch, and minimizing exposure to contaminated cargo, aerospace ground
   equipment (AGE), and material handling equipment (MHE).
      10.3.1.1. Inflight Diversion. When advised that a destination airfield is under CBRN
      attack or has been contaminated, the aircrew will divert to an uncontaminated airfield, if
      at all possible. Authority to land at a contaminated airfield will be specified in the
      controlling OPORD.
      10.3.1.2. Survival Launch. If caught on the ground during attack warning, every
      reasonable effort will be made to launch to avoid the attack. Upon proper clearances,
      aircrew may launch to survive if they have sufficient fuel and unrestricted, safe access to
      the runway. In practice, this option may only be practical for aircraft that have just
      landed or aircraft at or near the end of the runway. If launch is not possible, shut down
      engines and avoid running environmental control systems.                   Close aircraft
      doors/hatches/ramps, don Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), and seek personal
      protective cover on the base. If time does not permit using base facilities, remain in the
      sealed aircraft for a minimum of one-hour after the attack and/or follow host-base
      guidance.
      10.3.1.3. Avoiding Cross Contamination from AGE, MHE, and Cargo. All formerly
      contaminated equipment and cargo must be marked to facilitate contamination avoidance
      and the use of protective measures. Additionally, the air shipment of formerly
      contaminated cargo requires special precautions and must be specifically authorized by
      the senior transportation commander.
   10.3.2. Protection. When exposure to chemical and/or biological agents cannot be avoided,
   protection provides the force with the ability to survive and operate in a CBRN environment.
   Protection is afforded by individual protective equipment, collective protection, and
   hardening of facilities.
      10.3.2.1. Individual Protective Equipment. The current in-flight protective gear for
      aircrew members is the Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE). The ACDE
      includes the newer Aircrew Eye-Respiratory Protection System (AERPS) above the
      shoulders and the CWU-66/P or CWU-77/P Integrated Aircrew Chemical Coverall
      (IACC). The Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE) consists of the protective mask, C2 series
      canister (or filter element for MCU-2A/P protective mask), and over garment, boots, and
      gloves. The ACDE and GCE provide protection against chemical and biological agents.
      They do not provide blast or radiation protection from an RDD or nuclear detonation.
      The ACDE requires care during donning using "buddy dressing" procedures and Aircrew
      Flight Equipment (AFE) expertise during processing through the Aircrew Contamination
      Control Area (ACCA). NOTE: Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Members (AECM) will
      utilize the MCU-2A series mask.
          10.3.2.1.1. ACDE/GCE Issue. Aircrews will be issued sized ACDE and GCE at
          home station. Aircrews will ensure their ACDE and GCE are available at all times
120                                                   AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


         while in a CBRN threat area. Aircrew members will confirm the mobility bag
         contents and correct sizes.
         10.3.2.1.2. ACDE Wear During Ground Operations. Because aircraft contamination
         is unlikely to occur during flight, ground operations can represent the highest threat to
         aircrew safety. Protection from enemy attacks and exposure to liquid chemical agents
         is paramount. Aircrew should limit activities to essential duties only, and separate
         ground duties from air duties.
      10.3.2.2. Collective Protection. Collective protection provides a temperature-controlled,
      contamination-free environment to allow personnel relief from continuous wear of IPE
      such as the ACDE. The basic concept for most facility collective protective solutions is
      to employ overpressure, filtration, and controlled entry/exit. The intent is to provide rest
      and relief accommodations, as well as provide medical treatment in contamination free
      zone. Crewmembers should avail themselves of facilities, if provided, on the airfield.
      10.3.2.3. Hardening. Permanent and expedient hardening measures are used to
      strengthen buildings and utility systems or provide barriers to resist blast effects. To
      reduce the potential of vapor exposure, personnel should consider the use of facilities
      above the first floor.
  10.3.3. Contamination Control. In the post-attack environment, contamination control
  measures limit the spread of chemical, biological, and radiological contamination through
  disease prevention measures, decontamination, and use of Exchange Zone (EZ) operations.
  Effective contamination control helps sustain air mobility operations by minimizing
  performance degradation, casualties, or loss of material.
      10.3.3.1. Disease Prevention. Up-to-date immunizations, standard personal hygiene
      practices, and the use of chemoprophylaxis are effective biological warfare defensive
      measures.
      10.3.3.2. Decontamination.
         10.3.3.2.1. Inflight Decontamination.           Air washing is a useful inflight
         decontamination technique for removing most of the liquid agent from aircraft metal
         surfaces. However, vapor hazards may remain in areas where the airflow
         characteristics prevent complete off-gassing (i.e., wheel wells, flap wells, rivet and
         screw heads, joints, etc.). Flights of at least 2 to 4 hours are recommended, and lower
         altitudes are more effective than higher altitudes. Fly with the aircraft configured
         (gear, flaps, and slats extended) as long as possible to maximize the airflow in and
         around as many places as possible. Be advised that exterior contamination may seep
         into the aircraft interior creating a vapor hazard for aircrews. Use of ACDE is
         recommended.
         10.3.3.2.2. Limits of Decontamination. Complete decontamination of aircraft and
         equipment may be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. Formerly contaminated
         assets will be restricted to DOD-controlled airfields and not released from US
         government control.
      10.3.3.3. Exchange Zone (EZ) Operations. The AMC Counter-Chemical, Biological,
      Radiological, and Nuclear Concept of Operations (C-CBRN CONOPS) Concept for Air
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                 121


      Mobility Operations in a Chemical and Biological Environment (CB CONOPS) describes
      a method for continuing the vital flow of personnel into a contaminated airfield while
      limiting the number of air mobility aircraft and personnel exposed to the contaminated
      environment. The purpose of the EZ is to minimize the spread of contamination within
      the air mobility fleet, preserving as many aircraft as possible for unrestricted international
      flight. The EZ is an area (located at uncontaminated airfield) set aside to facilitate the
      exchange of uncontaminated (clean) cargo/passengers to a contaminated (dirty) airframe,
      or visa versa, without cross-contamination. Additional information on the EZ is available
      through HQ AMC/A3X.
10.4. Flight Operations.
   10.4.1. Mission Planning. Aircrews must be mentally prepared to face the dangers of CBRN
   weapons. Flight/mission planning must be thorough. Aircraft commanders should
   emphasize ACDE wear, crew coordination, CBRN hazards and countermeasures, inflight
   diversion, plans for onload/offload in the event of a ground attack, and plans for the return
   leg in the event of aircraft contamination. Alternative scenario plans should also be
   considered in the event MOPP conditions change.
   10.4.2. Establishing the Threat Level. Aircrews should monitor command and control
   channels to ensure they receive the latest information concerning the destination's alert
   condition. Diversion of aircraft to alternate "clean" locations may be required, unless
   operational necessity otherwise dictates. The TACC or theater C2 agency (normally through
   the controlling OPORD) will direct aircrew pre-exposure activities such as medical pre-
   treatment for chemical/biological exposure or issue of dosimetry for potential radiological
   hazards.
   10.4.3. Fuel Requirements. Extra fuel may be needed to compensate for altitude restrictions
   as the result of CB agent exposure. During purge periods, the aircraft will be unpressurized.
   Although the aircrew can use the aircraft oxygen systems, passengers wearing GCE cannot,
   thus restricting the aircraft cruise altitude and increasing fuel requirements accordingly.
   10.4.4. Oxygen Requirements. Operating a contaminated aircraft will increase oxygen
   requirements. Aircrew wear of ACDE will require use of the aircraft oxygen system to
   counter actual/suspected contamination. Using the 100 percent oxygen setting offers the
   greatest protection in a contaminated environment. Appropriate oxygen quantity must be on
   board to meet higher consumption rates. Use the aircraft flight manual charts to calculate the
   required quantity.
   10.4.5. Donning Equipment. Aircrew will don ACDE based on the alarm condition (See
   Airman‘s Manual (AFPAM 10-100)). Use the "buddy dressing" procedures. AMC crews
   refer to AMCVA 11-303, AERP Donning Checklist and AMCVA 11-304, ACDE Donning
   Checklist, to ensure proper wear. Crews from other MAJCOMs use MAJCOM approved
   publications. When wearing the ACDE, Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto injectors will be
   kept in the upper left ACDE pocket. If the integrated survival vest/body armor is worn, the
   Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto injectors may be kept in the lower right flight suit pocket.
   This standardized location will enable personnel to locate the medication should an
   individual be overcome by CWA poisoning. M-9 paper on the flight suit will facilitate
   detection of liquid chemical agents and ACCA processing. M-9 paper should be placed on
   the flight suit prior to entering the CBRN threat area or when an alarm ―yellow‖ or higher
 122                                                    AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


   has been declared. When inbound to a CBRN threat area, prior to descent, the aircraft
   commander will ensure crew and passengers don appropriate protective equipment IAW
   arrival destination's MOPP level and brief aircrew operations in the CBRN threat area. As a
   minimum, this briefing will include: flight deck isolation, oxygen requirements, air
   conditioning system requirements, IPE requirements, ground operations, and MOPP levels.
   Aircrew members must determine if the wear of the integrated survival vest/body armor and
   LPUs will restrict dexterity and mobility to the point that it becomes a safety issue. If the
   aircrew deems the equipment to create a safety of flight concern, then the items may be pre-
   positioned (instead of worn) on the aircraft to be readily available to the aircrew.
   10.4.6. Communicating Down-line Support. Pass aircraft and cargo contamination
   information through command and control channels when inbound. This information will be
   used to determine if a diversion flight is required or decontamination teams are needed.
   Report the physical condition of any crew/passengers who are showing agent symptoms and
   whether they are wearing chemical defense ensembles.
10.5. Ground Operations.
   10.5.1. Crew Rest Procedures. Operational necessity may require the aircrew to rest/fly in a
   contaminated environment. If the mission is not being staged by another aircrew or pre-
   flight crews are not available, the aircrew may pre-flight, load, and secure the aircraft prior to
   entering crew rest. The departing aircrew will perform necessary crew preparations and pre-
   flight briefings. Then, they will report to the ACCA for processing and ACDE donning with
   assistance from ALS personnel. If possible, aircrew transport should be provided in a
   covered vehicle. Aircrews should avoid pre-flighting the aircraft prior to departure to
   prevent contamination spread to them and/or the aircraft. As aircrews proceed to fly, they
   will require assistance from ground support personnel in removing their aircrew protective
   overcape and overboots prior to entering the aircraft.
   10.5.2. Onload and Offload Considerations. Extreme care must be exercised to prevent
   contamination spread to the aircraft interior during ground operations, particularly to the
   flight deck area. Reduce the number of personnel entering the aircraft. Contaminated engine
   covers, safety pins and chocks will not be placed in the aircraft unless sealed in clean plastic
   bags. Aircrew members entering the aircraft will remove plastic overboots and overcape
   portions of the aircrew ensemble and ensure flight/mobility bags are free of contaminants and
   placed in clean plastic bags. Prior to entering the aircraft all personnel should implement
   boot wash/decontamination procedures. Aircrew exiting aircraft into a contaminated
   environment will don plastic overboots and overcape prior to leaving the aircraft.
   10.5.3. Communications. Conducting on/offloading operations, while wearing the complete
   ACDE, complicates communications capability. Use the mini-amplifier/speaker or the
   aircraft public address system and augment with flashlight and hand signals, as required.
   10.5.4. Airlift of Retrograde Cargo. Only CRITICAL retrograde cargo will be moved from
   a contaminated to an uncontaminated airbase. Critical requirements are pre-designated in
   theater war plans. Onload cargo will be protected prior to and while being transported to the
   aircraft. If contaminated, protective cover(s) will be removed/replaced just prior to placing
   the cargo on the aircraft. It is the user's responsibility to decontaminate cargo for air
   shipment. The airlift of contaminated or formerly contaminated cargo requires the approval
   of the senior transportation commander.
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                               123


   10.5.5. Passenger/Patients. A path should be decontaminated between the aircraft and the
   ground transportation vehicle to reduce interior contamination when loading/unloading
   passengers/patients. Normally, externally contaminated patients and those infected with
   contagious biological agents will not be transported onboard AMC or AMC-procured
   aircraft. The AMC/CC is the waiver authority to this policy. Other MAJCOMs will
   establish their own policies for transportation of externally contaminated patients and those
   infected with contagious biological agents. NOTE: An altitude below 10,000 feet is
   recommended due to AECM use of the ground chemical mask.
   10.5.6. Physiological Factors. Aircraft commanders must be very sensitive to the problems
   resulting from physical exertion while wearing ACDE. The aircraft commander should
   consider factors such as ground time, temperature and remaining mission requirements when
   determining on/offload capabilities. Individuals involved should be closely monitored for
   adverse physiological effects.
   10.5.7. Work Degradation Factors. Work timetables need to be adjusted to minimize
   thermal stress caused by wearing the ACDE. Aircrews must weigh all factors when
   performing in-flight and ground duties. The following are degradation factors for wearing
   full GCE, and may also be used to represent the Task Time Multipliers for the ACDE. A
   more extensive discussion of this subject is found in AFMAN 10-2602, Nuclear, Biological,
   Chemical, and Conventional (NBCC) Defense Operations and Standards.

   10.5.8. Outbound with Actual/Suspected Chemical Contamination. Once airborne with
   actual/suspected vapor contamination, the aircraft must be purged for 2 hours using Smoke
   and Fume Elimination procedures. To ensure no liquid contamination exists, a close
   inspection of aircrew, passenger ensembles, and cargo will be conducted using M-8 and M-9
   detection paper. Detection paper only detects certain liquid agents and will not detect vapor
   hazards. Above the shoulder ACDE should only be removed if there is absolutely no vapor
   hazard. Be advised that residual contamination (below the detectable levels of currently
   fielded detection equipment) may be harmful in an enclosed space. The aircrew must take
   every precaution to prevent spreading of liquid contaminants, especially on the flight deck
   area. The best course is to identify actual/suspected contamination, avoid those areas for the
   remainder of the flight, and keep the cargo compartments cool. If an aircrew member or
   passenger has been in contact with liquid contaminants, all personnel aboard the aircraft will
   stay in full ACDE/GCE until processed through their respective contamination control area
   (CCA). Upon arrival, the contaminated aircraft will be parked in an isolated area and
   cordoned to protect unsuspecting ground personnel.
   10.5.9. Documenting Aircraft Contamination. When it is suspected or known that an
   aerospace vehicle or piece of equipment has been contaminated with a radiological,
   biological or chemical contaminant, a Red X will be entered and an annotation will be made
   in historical records for the lifecycle of the equipment.
   10.5.10. 10-Foot Rule. The 10-foot rule was developed in order to provide guidance for
   protecting personnel using or handling contaminated resources (such as pallets) or working in
   locations with materials that might retain a residual chemical. The 10-foot rule embodies a
   safety factor that goes beyond current OSD guidance (which allows removal of IPE
   whenever detectors no longer detect a chemical agent vapor hazard). There are two phases
   associated with the 10-foot rule.
       10.5.10.1. Initial Phase. During the initial phase, personnel will remain in MOPP 4
       whenever they stay within 10 feet of the contaminated equipment for more than a few
       seconds. This MOPP level provides personnel the maximum protection from the
       chemical agent as it transitions from a contact and vapor hazard to a vapor hazard only.
       10.5.10.2. Follow-on Phase. In the follow-on phase, personnel will use gloves of a sort
       (i.e. leather, rubber, cloth, etc.) when operating on or handling the contaminated
       equipment. Although a contact hazard is unlikely, relatively small amounts of the agent
       may still be present. The use of gloves will ensure that unnecessary bare skin contact
       with agent residue is avoided.
       10.5.10.3. Table 10. 2 shows times associated with initial and follow-on phases of the
       10-foot rule. To simplify response processes, commanders may choose to use the worst
       case scenario as the foundation for all 10-foot rule actions, i.e., 24 hours for the initial
       phase and all periods of time greater than 24 hours for the follow-on phase.

                                            Chapter 11

                                NAVIGATION PROCEDURES

11.1. General. This chapter establishes procedures and requirements for worldwide enroute C-
21 navigation. It is to be used in conjunction with procedures and requirements set forth in AFI
11-202, Volume 3, AFMAN 11-217, and FLIP. Since airspace and associated navigational aid
equipment capability are rapidly evolving, pilots must maintain an in depth knowledge of current
requirements/policies.
   11.1.1. Prolonged Loss of Contact. Aircrews must ensure they are following proper
   navigation crosscheck procedures to maintain airspace situational awareness.
       11.1.1.1. Aircrews will use navigation charts to identify radio frequency changeover
       points to minimize the likelihood of prolonged loss of communication with ATC/radio
       operators. Additionally, crews must monitor both VHF and UHF Guard to the maximum
       extent possible.
       11.1.1.2. In the event of known or suspected loss of two-way radio capability, follow the
       communications failure procedures published in the FIH.
       11.1.1.3. In cases of suspected loss of contact with ATC, attempt to reestablish contact
       using other aircraft to relay messages to ATC controllers.
11.2. Operations in International/Territorial Airspace. (See FLIP, FCG, and AP, for further
guidance). US Military aircraft and DoD personnel entering another nation to conduct US
government business must have the approval of the foreign government concerned to enter their
airspace. Foreign clearances for US international air operations are obtained through US
officials known as Defense Attache Officers (DAOs).
   11.2.1. There are essentially two types of airspace: international airspace and territorial
   airspace. International airspace includes all airspace seaward of coastal states' territorial seas.
   Military aircraft operate in such areas free of interference or control by the coastal state.
   Territorial airspace includes airspace above territorial seas, archipelagic waters, inland
   waters, and land territory, and is sovereign airspace. Overflight may be conducted in such
   areas only with the consent of the sovereign country.
   11.2.2. Consistent with international law, the US recognizes sea claims up to 12NMs.
   Diplomatic constraints and/or a lack of diplomatic clearances usually result in missions
   operating in international airspace. Therefore, it is imperative sufficient information be
   provided far enough in advance to allow compliance with FCG requirements established by
   the countries concerned. The US does not normally recognize territorial claims beyond
   12NMs; however, specific guidance from certain US authorities may establish limits, which
   differ from the standard.
   11.2.3. Flight Information Region (FIR). A FIR is an area of airspace within which flight
   information and related services are provided. A FIR does not reflect international borders or
   sovereign airspace. Aircraft may operate within an established FIR without approval of the
   adjacent country, provided the PIC avoids flight in territorial airspace.
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                 127


   11.2.4. Aircrews on a flight plan route, which takes them from international airspace into
   territorial airspace, for which approved aircraft clearances were obtained, should not amend
   entry point(s).
   11.2.5. Violations of foreign sovereignty result from unauthorized or improper entry or
   departure of aircraft. Aircrews will not enter into territorial airspace for which a clearance
   has not been duly requested and granted through diplomatic channels.
   11.2.6. ATC agencies are not vested with authority to grant diplomatic clearances for
   penetration of sovereign airspace where prior clearance is required from the respective
   country. Aircraft clearances are obtained through diplomatic channels only.
   11.2.7. In the event an ATC agency challenges the validity of a flight routing or attempts to
   negate existing clearances, PICs must evaluate the circumstances. The normal response will
   be to attempt to advise the ATC agency that the aircraft will continue to planned destination,
   as cleared in international airspace. The key phrase is "in international airspace." Safety of
   flight is paramount in determining mission continuation. Under no circumstances should
   aircrews construe a clearance, which routes their mission over sovereign airspace, which was
   not approved through diplomatic channels before mission departure, as being valid
   authorization.
   11.2.8. Aircrews operating missions requiring unique or specially developed routing will
   normally be briefed at home station, onload station, and/or by the last C2 facility transited
   before performing the critical portion of the mission.
   11.2.9. Aircrews (except on weather reconnaissance missions) normally are not tasked to
   and will not fly "due regard" routings unless coordinated with the appropriate MAJCOM C2
   and specifically directed in the mission FRAG. The "due regard" or "operational" option
   obligates the military PIC to be their own ATC agency to separate their aircraft from all other
   air traffic. If operational requirements dictate, PICs may exercise the "due regard" option to
   protect their aircraft. Aircraft will return to normal air traffic services as soon as practical.
   Refer to FLIP GP for additional guidance on due regard.
11.3. Mission Planning.
   11.3.1. Flight Plan. Cross-check the advanced computer flight plan (ACFP) planned route
   against the route of flight entered on the DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan or DD Form
   1801, DoD International Flight Plan, and the approved diplomatic clearance.
   11.3.2. The C-21 is capable of displaying only magnetic heading information and is
   prohibited from operating in the Area of Magnetic Unreliability (AMU) IAW AFI 11-202
   V3.
      11.3.2.1. There are areas of Canada outside the AMU where NAVAIDS are oriented to
      true or grid north and true tracks apply, even on airways. The C-21 is authorized to
      operate in areas outside the AMU with NAVAIDS oriented to true or grid north, provided
      all aircraft navigation systems are operating properly. A thorough review of navigation
      procedures in higher latitudes in AFMAN 11-217 V1 Instrument Flight Procedures, is
      required prior to flight in these areas.
 128                                                    AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


       11.3.2.2. OG/CC approval is required to operate in areas outside the AMU but above 73°
       North or below 60° South due to limitations of the magnetic variation database in the
       FMS.
   11.3.3. True or grid instrument approach procedures (except RNAV (GPS)) are limited to
   day, VFR only for the C-21.
   11.3.4. RNAV(GPS) approaches based on true or grid are allowed during night or IMC
   provided the printed RNAV(GPS) procedure includes all required magnetic heading
   information, the procedure is in the aircraft database and all other normal RNAV(GPS)
   requirements are met (RAIM, current database, etc.).
11.4. Flight Progress. Use the following procedures for flight progress:
   11.4.1. Remote or Oceanic Flight. All aircrews transiting remote or oceanic areas in UNS-
   1B equipped C-21s will use the procedure outlined below. Accomplish prior to the first
   sortie of the day that will transit an area where GPS is the only means of navigation. UNS-
   1B equipped C-21s are not capable of doing enroute predictive RAIM as required for
   compliance with remote/oceanic navigation requirements. The procedure, while not a true
   predictive RAIM prediction as required by FAA/ICAO regulations, does provide a capability
   to determine satellite coverage, enhancing safety prior to flight in remote/oceanic areas.
       11.4.1.1. Aircrews will download the ―Request for GPS RAIM Predictions‖ form from
       the AMC A3V web site at https://private.AMC.af.mil/a3/A3V/, select ―Pubs‖ link, then
       select ―UNS-1B GPS RAIM Predictions‖ from under ―C-21 Publications‖. Follow the
       directions on the form to contact the Joint Space Operations Center
       (JSPOC). Accomplish this prior to the first flight of the day for all remote/oceanic sorties
       for that day. Allow 30 minutes to process the request. Requests can be made up to 24
       hours prior to the first flight. Predictions are valid for the times requested on the
       form. Crews should add a ±2 hour buffer to allow for early departures and unplanned
       delays. Predictions are valid only for the requested route. The JSPOC reply will indicate
       whether or not suitable satellite coverage is available for the requested
       time/location(s). JSPOC has been provided with criteria for this determination by
       AMC/A3VS. More specific information will classify the reply. If suitable satellite
       coverage will not be available during the planned time(s), delay the mission until suitable
       satellite coverage will be available or change routing.
       11.4.1.2. This procedure will enhance safety by informing an aircrew in advance if
       sufficient satellite coverage for RAIM will not be available over a planned route of
       flight. As RAIM and adequate satellite navigation capabilities are dependent upon many
       factors (antenna integrity, terrain, atmospheric conditions, etc), this is not a guarantee of
       satellite reception sufficient for navigation. This prediction only informs the aircrew that
       sufficient satellites are/are not available.
       11.4.1.3. All crews planning to operate in Atlantic Oceanic Airspace will reference AP2
       and conduct a detailed review of the North Atlantic Minimum Navigation Performance
       Specification (MNPS) Airspace Operations Manual and review the associated FIR
       Oceanic NOTAMS. The MNPS manual is published on behalf of the North Atlantic
       Systems Planning Group (NAT SPG) by the European and North Atlantic Office of
       ICAO. It summarizes regulatory guidance contained in relevant ICAO annexes, such as
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                            129


     PANS/ATM Air Traffic Management (doc. 4444) and NAT Regional Supplementary
     Procedures (doc. 7030) pertaining to operations over the North Atlantic. It is used by the
     majority of worldwide operators in the North Atlantic region and is endorsed by the
     FAA.
        11.4.1.3.1. The MNPS manual also contains many basic principles for good CRM,
        plotting and guidelines for handling contingencies which are common to all regions
        of the world. However, crews must be aware that the manual is specific to the North
        Atlantic and is not the source of information for procedures in every oceanic
        region. Crews will conduct a thorough study of the procedures for the region in
        which they are planned to operate.
        11.4.1.3.2. The ICAO does not publish a separate manual for Pacific or Indian Ocean
        operations.   However, the FAA website contains operational procedures &
        information for other oceanic regions of the world which shall be reviewed prior to
        operating in that airspace. The information can be accessed on the FAA website
        indicated below.
        11.4.1.3.3. In the event that conflicting information is discovered between FLIP and
        the MNPS manual, the MNPS manual takes precedence. Furthermore, the manual is
        amended by FAA NOTAMS which contain the most up to date information and these
        take precedence over all other guidance. Aircrews will review FAA Oceanic
        NOTAMS; specifically section 2 of part 3, ―International Oceanic Airspace Notices‖
        in the notices to airmen found on the FAA website.
        11.4.1.3.4. Relevant documents can be found at:                 FAA NOTAMS:
        http://www.faa.gov/airports_airtraffic/air_traffic/publications/notices (refer to
        part 3. International oceanic airspace notices) and MNPS Operations Manual:
        http://www.nat-pco.org/mnpsa.htm.       Oceanic     and     Offshore   operations:
        http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/enro
        ute/oceanic/
        11.4.1.3.5. Aircrews and mission planners are reminded that area planning
        documents (AP) are not all inclusive and should not be the sole source for flight
        planning, especially for North Atlantic missions. Aircrews identifying erroneous
        FLIP information will comply with general planning, Chapter 11, for submitting
        revisions, changes, or corrections by notifying AFFSA/A3OFA at:
        hqaffsa.a3oia@tinker.af.mil. Crews may also submit an NGA quality feedback
        card (available inside the IFR supplement) or send the information via email to:
        quality@nga.mil.
        11.4.1.3.6. Review T.O. 1C-21A-1 procedures for both normal and abnormal
        operations of the UNS-1B. Areas of emphasis include:
        11.4.1.3.6.1. (1) Use of the ―Inflight Initialization‖ procedure on page 1-462.
        11.4.1.3.6.2. (2) ―Position Uncertain‖ annunciation on page 1-466.
        11.4.1.3.6.3. (3) ―NAV Sensor Accuracy Messages‖ on page 1-546.
130                                                  AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


         11.4.1.3.6.4. (4) Do not bump the GPS anti-spoofing switch when entering or exiting
         the flight deck. This will cause a loss of usable navigation data and aircraft position
         information. The switch should normally be in the ―OFF A/S‖ position.
         11.4.1.3.7. Report all FMS navigation anomalies to unit OGV regardless of location
         or airspace type including CONUS locations. Unit OGVs forward reports to
         MAJCOM Stan/Eval who will forward to AMC/A3VS as lead command.
      11.4.1.4. Prior to flight on oceanic flights, plot the oceanic portion on an appropriate
      chart and compute an Equal Time Point (ETP). PICs shall annotate the chart with the
      mission number, PIC‘s name, and date. If practical, chart may be reused. ACFP is
      currently incapable of calculating ETPS. Guidance on calculating an ETP can be found
      on the Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation AF Portal web page in the flight planning
      section                      at                     HTTPS://WWW.MY.AF.MIL/GCSS-
      AF/USAF/EP/GLOBALTAB.DO?COMMAND=ORG&CHANNELPAGEID=-
      1325640&PAGEID=0
         11.4.1.4.1. Calculating an ETP (PACAF crews will follow PACAF ETP calculation
         guidance).
             11.4.1.4.1.1. Calculating an ETP on an overwater leg is critical to knowing when
             you have reached a point where the time to either turn around and return to a
             suitable emergency airfield or to press ahead to the next suitable landing field is
             the same. Use the data from your CFP to determine distances and wind factors.
             The wind factors shown are the average (AWF) for the entire route and the first
             (WF1) and second (WF2) halves of the flight. Keep in mind the portion of the
             flight between suitable landing fields may not coincide with the first and second
             halves of the flight or your CAT I routing (an alternate may be closer to the side
             of your route). NOTE: The differences in the two-engine normal and single-
             engine LRC profiles are significant. Therefore, special attention during mission
             planning should be given to determining turnaround point if required due to
             engine loss. Initial estimates show the single-engine LRC ETP moves upwind of
             the two-engine ETP by as much as 30%. See Table 11.1 to calculate a two-
             engine ETP.
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                              131


Table 11.1. Two-Engine ETP Calculations.




              11.4.1.4.1.2. You should always perform a ―common sense‖ check after your
              calculations. In the example above, both WFs show a tailwind. Therefore, your
              ETP should be prior to half of the total flight time (i.e. prior to 1.5 hrs in this
              example). This example checks because 1.4 hrs is less then 1.5 hrs.
   11.4.2. Anytime the FMS NAVAID/waypoint database is not current or a pilot-defined
   waypoint will be used for navigation, both pilots will verify waypoint data inserted into the
   FMS prior to selection as the active waypoint. Check both the coordinate information and
   the distances between waypoints against the flight plan.
 132                                                    AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


   11.4.3. Obtain a coast out fix prior to, or immediately upon entering the Category (CAT) I
   Route (see Atch 1 for definition) or over-water segment. Perform a gross navigational error
   check using available NAVAIDS and annotate the position and time on the chart.
   11.4.4. When approaching each waypoint on a CAT I route, recheck coordinates for the next
   waypoint.
   11.4.5. Approximately 10 minutes after passing each oceanic waypoint, record and plot the
   aircraft position and time on the chart, and ensure compliance with courses and ETA
   tolerances.
   11.4.6. If a revised clearance is received, record and plot the new route of flight on the chart.
   11.4.7. Upon return to home station, turn in the charts (copies if reused) and applicable
   computer flight plans to the squadron. Squadrons will retain the charts, computer flight
   plans, and associated materials for a minimum of 90 days.
   11.4.8. Aircrews (except on weather reconnaissance missions) normally are not tasked to
   and should not fly "due regard" routings unless coordinated with the appropriate MAJCOM
   C2 and specifically directed in the mission FRAG. The "due regard" or "operational" option
   obligates the military PIC to be their own ATC agency to separate their aircraft from all other
   air traffic. If operational requirements dictate, PICs may exercise the "due regard" option to
   protect their aircraft. Aircraft will return to normal air traffic services as soon as practical.
11.5. Navigational Aid Capability.
   11.5.1. Comply with AFMAN 11-217V1 and Table 6.3 of this AFI for operations in various
   types of airspace. NOTE: Airspace and associated navigational aid equipment capability are
   rapidly evolving.      Pilots must maintain an in depth knowledge of current FLIP
   requirements/policies.
   11.5.2. Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace. Airspace where RVSM
   is applied is considered special qualification airspace (FL290-FL410). Both the operator and
   the specific aircraft type must be approved for operations in these areas. Refer to FLIP AP
   1/2/3 for theater unique information and the following for RVSM requirements:
       11.5.2.1. Both primary altimeters, at least one autopilot, the altitude advisory system, and
       the transponder, must be fully operational. The PIC will request a new clearance to avoid
       this airspace should any of this equipment fail.
       11.5.2.2. Engage the autopilot during level cruise, except when circumstances such as
       the need to re-trim the aircraft or turbulence require disengagement.
       11.5.2.3. Crosscheck the altimeters before or immediately upon coast out.             Record
       readings of both altimeters.
       11.5.2.4. Continuously crosscheck the primary altimeters to ensure they agree ± 200 feet.
       11.5.2.5. Limit climb and descent rates to 1,000 feet per minute when operating near
       other aircraft to reduce potential TCAS advisories.
       11.5.2.6. Immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails after entry into
       RVSM airspace and coordinate a plan of action.
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                              133


     11.5.2.7. Document malfunctions or failures of RVSM required equipment in the aircraft
     forms.
  11.5.3. Not Used.
  11.5.4. Required Navigation Performance (RNP) Airspace. Airspace where RNP is applied
  is considered special qualification airspace. RNP airspace is being incorporated around the
  world to increase air traffic capacity by decreasing separation requirements between routes.
  Pilots will immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails after entry into
  RNP-10 airspace and coordinate a plan of action. Document in the aircraft forms
  malfunctions or failures of RNP required equipment.
     11.5.4.1. RNP-10. Navigation accuracy is within 10 nm of track 95% of the time. Only
     C-21 aircraft modified with the Universal UNS-1L Flight Management System are RNP-
     10 certified. Remote/Oceanic operation in RNP-10 airspace is authorized provided that
     all required equipment is operational and adequate GPS coverage is available. The GPS
     coverage must be checked using the Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE) software prior
     to departure. If the FDE software verifies satellite availability and the predicted
     Horizontal Integrity Limit (HIL) is within tolerances for the airspace (e.g. less than 10
     NM for RNP-10 airspace), then the flight is authorized. If sufficient satellite coverage for
     FDE is not available or the HIL is greater than airspace tolerances, then the flight is not
     authorized. The flight must be delayed until time when FDE is available and the HIL is
     within parameters. C-21 aircraft with the UNS-1B, although capable, are not certified for
     RNP-10. This is due to the lack of FDE capability.
  11.5.5. Basic Area Navigation (BRNAV) Airspace. The C-21 is approved for BRNAV
  operations and has no BRNAV restrictions. Airspace where BRNAV is applied is considered
  special qualification airspace. BRNAV meets a track keeping accuracy equal or better than
  +/- 5 NM for 95% of the flight time. Minimum equipment to operate in BRNAV airspace is
  an approved GPS with Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) provided that the
  system is monitored by the flight crew and that in the event of a system failure, the aircraft
  retains the capability to navigate relative to ground based NAVAIDs (i.e. VOR, DME, and
  NDB). Pilots will immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails after entry
  into BRNAV airspace and coordinate a plan of action; however, with sufficient NAVAID
  reception, the C-21A may still operate in the BRNAV airspace. Document in the aircraft
  forms malfunctions or failures of RNP required equipment.
  11.5.6. FM Immunity (FMI). The C-21 is equipped with dual FMI VHF navigation
  receivers and is considered fully compliant with no restrictions. Refer to the applicable area
  planning (AP) series for more information concerning FMI operations.
  11.5.7. Precision Positioning Service (PPS). Currently no operational approval exists for the
  use of encrypted PPS for IFR navigation in civil controlled airspace. Crews will use GPS
  standard positioning service (SPS) unless specifically authorized by HQ AMC/A3V.

                 AIRCREW MAINTENANCE SUPPORT PROCEDURES

12.1. General. This chapter contains aircrew procedures not contained in the flight manual,
other portions of this AFI, or other publications.
12.2. Responsibilities. Aircrew may assist the normal maintenance function when critical
contingency tasking dictate their use, provided this action does not impact crew duty and crew
rest limits specified in Chapter 3 of this AFI.
12.3. Authority to Clear a Red X. Pilots are not normally authorized to clear a Red X. If a
situation is encountered where the aircraft is on a Red X and qualified maintenance personnel are
not available to clear it, the PIC may obtain authorization to clear the Red X from the owning
MXG/CC or OG/CC. Other crew members are not authorized to clear a Red X.
12.4. Aircraft Servicing. Aircrew are normally not required to service the aircraft; however,
they are qualified and authorized to perform those aircrew maintenance support tasks found in
this volume. The aircrew performs these tasks only in the absence of qualified maintenance
personnel and is designed for support of the aircraft and its mission while away from home
station. Without exception, the applicable checklists will be used during all refueling and de-
fueling operations.
   12.4.1. Aircraft Refueling. Aircrew members qualified in ground refueling may perform
   refueling duties. Aircrews will only refuel in cases when maintenance support is not readily
   available and the mission would be delayed.
       12.4.1.1. Avoid refueling with JP-8+100 while transiting airfields with JP-8+100
       capabilities. AMC aircraft are not allowed to operate on JP-8+100, except in emergency
       conditions. All JP-8+100 locations are required to maintain a clean JP-8 capability to
       support transient aircraft. If inadvertent refueling with JP-8+100 occurs comply with the
       following:
           12.4.1.1.1. De-fuel the aircraft prior to flight.
           12.4.1.1.2. Make an AFTO Form 781 entry stating ―Caution: Aircraft refueled using
           JP-8+100, preventative measures must be taken when de-fueling.‖
       12.4.1.2. When crewmembers are required to refuel, a pilot will act as the refueling team
       supervisor. Pilots acting as refueling supervisors and panel operators will comply with
       T.O. 00-25-172, Ground Servicing Of Aircraft And Static Grounding/Bonding (ATOS),
       and applicable C-21 series T.O.s.
   12.4.2. Concurrent Ground Operations. IAW T.O. 00-25-172, Ground Servicing Of Aircraft
   And Static Grounding/Bonding (ATOS), C-21 aircraft are authorized to conduct concurrent
   servicing using a deplaned aircrew member as the Chief Servicing Supervisor (CSS). The
   CSS shall ensure aircrew members and servicing personnel accomplish concurrent servicing
   (CS) in accordance with T.O. 00-25-172, Ground Servicing Of Aircraft And Static
   Grounding/Bonding (ATOS),and servicing technical orders. Aircrews performing Dash-1
   preflight inspections or cargo loading concurrent with servicing must have cooperation and
   close coordination with the CSS. The CSS will remain in continuous contact (either hand
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                               135


  signals or voice communication) with fuel servicing team members during the entire
  servicing operation. When the aircrew is at the aircraft, the PIC is responsible for all aspects
  of aircraft operations and shall inform the CSS how aircrew members will participate in
  passenger evacuation/safety. In keeping with the guidelines in T.O. 00-25-172, Ground
  Servicing Of Aircraft And Static Grounding/Bonding (ATOS) ,CSS has authority over all
  phases of CS operations to include personnel participating in the refuel.
     12.4.2.1. Use the following guidelines when CS operations are conducted with
     passengers on board:
         12.4.2.1.1. A current and qualified crew member will be designated the passenger
         compartment monitor (PCM) and shall continuously monitor passengers during CS.
         PCMs will not perform other duties during servicing.
         12.4.2.1.2. Not used.
         12.4.2.1.3. The PCM shall brief passengers on emergency egress, exits, prohibitions,
         and hazards. Passengers will remain seated but will not wear seat belts during CS.
         When possible, conduct this briefing prior to servicing. If servicing is in progress, the
         briefing will be given immediately after boarding.
         12.4.2.1.4. When authorized, passengers may board or exit the aircraft for the
         express purpose of loading for departure or offloading upon arrival. Boarding or
         exiting must be opposite of servicing operations. Once onboard, except for
         emergencies, passengers shall not deplane once servicing commences.
         12.4.2.1.5. Passengers are not required to ground themselves.
         12.4.2.1.6. Passenger representatives will assist the PCM when passengers board and
         exit. Passengers must remain outside the vapor hazard area, the fuel servicing safety
         zone (FSSZ) by 50 feet, oxygen servicing area, and 25 feet from fuel vents during
         servicing. Movement into or within the FSSZ during concurrent servicing must be
         under control of the CSS.
         12.4.2.1.7. The PIC, or designated aircrew representative, or CSS will advise PCMs
         when to evacuate passengers.
         12.4.2.1.8. Unless environmental conditions dictate, the primary emergency exit will
         remain open and stairs in place.
         12.4.2.1.9. The PCM shall set the interior lighting as bright as possible to suit the
         combat environment.
         12.4.2.1.10. The pilot shall ensure cargo loading or unloading does not jeopardize
         passenger safety. Do not load/unload cargo containing explosives, oxygen,
         flammable gases or liquids during CS.
     12.4.2.2. Simultaneous fuel and oxygen servicing is not authorized.
  12.4.3. The following guidance will be used for fuel servicing (refuel) operations only:
     12.4.3.1. Electric and electronic equipment may be left on provided it does not radiate
     energy; but it must not be turned on or off during refueling. Laptops and cellular phones
     are only allowed when outside the FSSZ.
 136                                                   AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


       12.4.3.2. TACANs and radar altimeter must be turned off.
       12.4.3.3. Radar may be in standby but, if time permits, should be turned off.
       12.4.3.4. IFF may be in standby but, if time permits, should be turned off.
       12.4.3.5. FMS may be ―on‖ and may be updated. Do not turn on or off during refuel
       operations.
       12.4.3.6. A ground power unit (GPU) may be used to supply aircraft electrical power.
   12.4.4. Aircrew Dash One Preflight Inspection Requirements.
       12.4.4.1. The aircrew dash one preflight inspection will remain valid until either:
           12.4.4.1.1. 72 hours from the time of inspection, or
           12.4.4.1.2. Another maintenance dash six preflight inspection is performed.
   12.4.5. Fire Protection and Crash Rescue.
       12.4.5.1. A fire bottle, if available, should be positioned near the front of the aircraft
       prior to starting engines.
   12.4.6. Aircrew and Maintenance Engine Runs.
       12.4.6.1. A mixture of aircrew and maintenance personnel will not normally accomplish
       engine runs. When an aircrew member is required to start or run up engines for
       maintenance purposes, the following procedures apply:
           12.4.6.1.1. Maintenance personnel will accomplish all necessary inspections and
           preparations for the engine run. These actions include but are not limited to:
           intake/exhaust inspections, access panel security servicing, and AFTO Form 781
           documentation.
12.5. Aircraft Recovery Away from Main Operating Base (MOB). The PIC is responsible
for ensuring the aircraft is turned to meet subsequent mission taskings. If qualified maintenance
specialists are unavailable, the aircrew is responsible for turning the aircraft to meet subsequent
mission taskings.
   12.5.1. The PIC is responsible for the recovery items including:
       12.5.1.1. Parking and receiving.
       12.5.1.2. Aircraft servicing, including Aircraft Ground Equipment (AGE) usage.

       12.5.1.7. Documenting AFTO 781-series forms.
   12.5.2. In all cases where aircrews must service the aircraft without qualified maintenance
   specialist assistance, comply with the appropriate maintenance T.O.
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                            137


  12.5.3. Aircrews are not qualified to accomplish the required ground inspections. In those
  instances where maintenance personnel are not available, the aircrew will enter a red dash
  symbol in the AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance
  Document, updating current status and enter a red dash symbol and a discrepancy that
  reflects that the applicable maintenance inspection (i.e. preflight, thru-flight, basic post-
  flight) is overdue.

                        CARGO AND PASSENGER PROCEDURES

13.1. General. A pilot coordinates loading or offloading with air terminal operations or the
shipping agency; plans loads; provides in-flight services to passengers; and supervises onloading
or offloading operations.
13.2. Responsibilities for Aircraft Loading.
   13.2.1. AMC Designated Stations:
       13.2.1.1. Aerial port personnel are responsible for selecting cargo and mail for airlift,
       completion of documentation, preparation of cargo for air shipment, and moving cargo to
       and from the aircraft to meet scheduled departure. They will advise the pilot of
       destination, size, weight, and types of cargo (classified, hazardous, etc.) to permit proper
       positioning, coordinate the traffic activities affecting loading and offloading, and assign
       sufficient airfreight loading personnel for cargo loading. Aerial port personnel are
       responsible for safe positioning of material handling equipment and cargo to or from the
       aircraft cargo door, ramp or auxiliary ground loading ramps.
       13.2.1.2. The pilot is responsible for aircraft preflight, load planning (as required) of all
       cargo, preparing weight and balance documentation; operating aircraft equipment;
       tiedown, and checking the cargo against manifests. The pilot supervises and directs
       on/offloading and is responsible for safe movement of cargo into and out of the aircraft.
   13.2.2. At locations without AMC air terminal or traffic personnel, the shipper assumes
   responsibilities in paragraph 13.2.1.1. and provides sufficient qualified personnel and
   handling equipment for loading or offloading. Pilot responsibilities and authority are the
   same as described in paragraphs 13.2.1.2.
13.3. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles. No part of the cargo load will extend over the aisle.
NOTE: All passenger hand carried items must fit under the seat and not obstruct the aisle. Any
item that does not meet this requirement will be secured so as not to obstruct the aisle.
13.4. Not used.
13.5. Passenger Handling.
   13.5.1. Not used.
   13.5.2. Passenger Missions:
       13.5.2.1. Passenger Missions. Maximize seat availability on AMC aircraft. It may be
       necessary for crews to perform passenger service functions at stations that do not have
       this capability. These functions include manifesting, anti-hijacking processing, and
       ensuring visa/passport requirements are met. Contact TACC at DSN 779-0355 or 779-
       0350 if any questions arise such as who may travel to specific locations or passport/visa
       requirements. File a copy of the passenger manifest with the most responsible on-scene
       agency if there is no base operations or other agency responsible for filing the manifest.
       13.5.2.2. A passenger service representative or crew member will assist passengers at the
       bottom of the steps. Make every effort to seat families together.
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                 139


     13.5.2.3. All passengers will be assigned a seat. Passenger may hand carry a Department
     of Transportation approved Infant Car Seat (ICS) aboard the aircraft to use in assigned
     seats. The Infant Car Seat (ICS) will be secured to the seat using seat belts. The pilot in
     command is the final authority in determining if the ICS is adequately secured. NOTE:
     Vest and harness type child restraint systems, and lap held child restraints are not
     approved for use in the aircraft. Adults may hold infants under the age of two in lap for
     any critical phase of flight. In the event of turbulence or an emergency landing, it is
     highly recommended for infants to be secured in an ICS. Sponsors will decide where
     infants will be positioned during these instances.
     13.5.2.4. Every effort shall be made to transport passengers with disabilities who are
     eligible to travel. Passenger service personnel and crewmembers will assist in loading,
     seating, and unloading disabled passengers. Travel may be disapproved by the chief of
     travel at the passenger travel section or the PIC if there is an unacceptable risk to the
     safety of the disabled passenger, other passengers, crew, or if operational
     necessity/equipment or manpower limitations preclude accepting disabled passengers.
     13.5.2.5. Download the baggage of no-show passengers and those removed from a flight.
     In the case of SAAMs or exercise missions at a non-AMC location, coordinate with CRE
     or CRG or deploying unit commanders to decide if the downloading of baggage is
     necessary.
     13.5.2.6. Passenger Operation of Emergency Exits. Prior to each flight, a pilot will
     formulate a passenger emergency egress plan. Only English-speaking, physically able
     adults (defined here as age 15 and older) will be seated next to the emergency exit. The
     intent of this is to ensure those passengers seated next to the emergency exit are aware of
     their duties and responsibilities in assisting the crew during emergency egress.
  13.5.3. Passenger Handling. PICs are responsible for required passenger handling duties.
  Passengers are limited to 30 pounds of baggage unless specific allowance for excess baggage
  is authorized and planned by the controlling agency. Passengers with excess baggage may be
  transported after the PIC determines the aircraft weight limitations and mission requirements
  are satisfied.
     13.5.3.1. Make every effort to enhance passenger comfort.
     13.5.3.2. Accomplish passenger briefings according to aircraft checklist or approved
     briefing guides, and printed passenger information guides IAW AFI 11-202V3. Use
     Passenger briefing checklist insert.
     13.5.3.3. Ensure the highest ranking DV is afforded the seat of preference, and other
     passengers are aware of the DV‘s status.
     13.5.3.4. Release space available IAW paragraph 6.3.8.
     13.5.3.5. All passengers, regardless of age, are required to be assigned their own seat.
  13.5.4. Body Fluid/Bio-Hazard Clean-Up:
     13.5.4.1. Aircrew personnel are the first line of defense when human fluids/waste
     contaminate aircraft. Because of the potential health risk to passengers and crew,
     crewmembers will immediately clean-up, to the best of their ability, all body fluids/waste
     when it does not detract from their primary duties. Crews will request troop

       commanders, team leaders, or traveling companions assist with the in-flight clean-up
       whenever possible. The clean-up will be accomplished using kits provided by fleet
       service and the procedures listed below.
           13.5.4.1.1. Cordon of the contaminated area if possible.
           13.5.4.1.2. Use non-sterile vinyl or nitrile gloves that cover part of the arm.
           13.5.4.1.3. Wear safety goggles or glasses and an N-95 disposable respirator or
           equivalent surgical mask to protect the mucous membranes and inhalation of blood-
           borne pathogens that may exist.
           13.5.4.1.4. Wear disposable coveralls and footwear covers to protect skin, clothing
           and footwear if available.
           13.5.4.1.5. Apply paper towels or other absorbent material to the fluid to absorb the
           fluids and minimize the spill area.
           13.5.4.1.6. Use fluid from clean-up kit.
           13.5.4.1.7. Place all material into bag.
           13.5.4.1.8. Avoid touching the mouth or face area with soiled hands or gloves. Wash
           hands thoroughly with soap and water after cleaning or clean hands with a alcohol-
           based hand gel (at least 60% alcohol) when soap and water is not available.
           13.5.4.1.9. Annotate type of body fluid/bio-hazard cleaned-up and location in AFTO
           Form 781A.
           13.5.4.1.10. When it is not possible for aircrew personnel or passengers to clean-up
           during flight, fleet service will be notified prior to landing.
13.6. Not used.
13.7. Loaded Weapons. Weapons are considered loaded if a magazine or clip is installed in the
weapon. This applies even though the clip or magazine is empty.
   13.7.1. Personnel who will engage an enemy force immediately upon arrival (actual combat)
   may carry basic combat loads on their person. Weapons will remain clear with magazines or
   clips removed until immediately before exiting the aircraft.
   13.7.2. Personnel who will not immediately engage an enemy force will store basic
   ammunition loads in a centralized location, as directed by the PIC, for redistribution upon
   arrival at the objective.
13.8. Weight and Balance. Accomplish weight and balance for this aircraft according to
T.O.1-1B-50, Weight and Balance, and T.O. 1C-21A-1 procedures. The unit possessing the
aircraft maintains the primary weight and balance handbook containing the current aircraft status
and provides a supplemental weight and balance handbook for each aircraft. ABSS is the only
approved software program for automated C-21 weight and balance computations.
13.9. Cargo Validation On/Offloading Procedures. Proper cargo or mail documentation will
accompany each load.
13.10. Procedures for Airlifting Hazardous Cargo.
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                              141

         13.10.4.1.12. Notification of the requirement to contact the next base to be transited
         at least 30 minutes prior to landing. (Such contact is not required for quantities other
         than those in paragraph 13.10.2. and paragraph 13.10.3.).
         13.10.4.1.13. Placard requirements.
         13.10.4.1.14. Escort team requirement, if applicable.
         13.10.4.1.15. Other special handling requirements.
      13.10.4.2. Cargo documentation and loading procedures.
         13.10.4.2.1. The PIC will ensure proper documentation, certification and
         identification of cargo is furnished. AFMAN 24-204(I), Preparing Hazardous
         Materials For Military Air Shipments, contains detailed instructions on packaging,
         marking, labeling, and certification requirements associated with the airlift of
         hazardous materials.     Hazardous materials/cargo not properly packaged and
         documented in accordance with AFMAN 24-204(I), Preparing Hazardous Materials
         For Military Air Shipments, will be rejected for air shipment by the pilot.
         13.10.4.2.2. Hazardous materials/cargo falls into many categories and the utmost
         precautions must be observed when handling or transporting these items. Load all
         hazardous material to permit easy access in-flight without moving other cargo.
         Adhere to the following appropriate safety precautions when loading hazardous cargo
         as appropriate:
             13.10.4.2.2.1. Ventilate the aircraft.
             13.10.4.2.2.2. Placard the aircraft.
             13.10.4.2.2.3. No smoking.
             13.10.4.2.2.4. Fire extinguishers must be available.
             13.10.4.2.2.5. Thoroughly inspect the cargo.
             13.10.4.2.2.6. Stow cargo away from heater outlets.
             13.10.4.2.2.7. Notify medical personnel in case of damage to radioactive

            materials.
            13.10.4.2.2.8. Use protective clothing and equipment.
     13.10.4.3. Flight Planning. Refer to paragraph 6.29.2. for flight planning requirements.
     13.10.4.4. Before engine start. Remove all placards from the aircraft. Provide
     controlling C2 agency parking location, approximate engine start time. Verify fire-
     fighting agency has the following hazardous materials information:
        13.10.4.4.1. Class of hazardous material aboard and the DoD class or division for
        explosive materials aboard.
        13.10.4.4.2. NEW for DoD class or division 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 explosives.
        13.10.4.4.3. ETD.
     13.10.4.5. Before landing. Unless specifically prohibited by the theater commander,
     FLIP, or FCG, contact the agency specified in FLIP/FCG, base operations dispatcher,
     control tower or approach control at least 30 minutes (or as soon as practical) before
     ETA. Inform the agency that ―hazardous materials" are onboard and verify hazardous
     materials/cargo message has been received. Request information is relayed immediately
     to base operations or the civil airport manager, crash and fire protection agency, and other
     support activities. If landing at a United States civil airport without a tower, provide
     information to the nearest FAA flight service station. Transmit the following
     information:
        13.10.4.5.1. Mission number, ETA, class of hazardous material, DoD class or
        division for explosives, net explosive weight (NEW), gross weight, and special
        handling requirements (e.g. isolated parking, security, technical escort teams, etc.).
     13.10.4.6. DoD requires aircraft carrying DoD class or division 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3
     explosives, hazardous class or division 2.3 or 6.1 zone A materials, and munitions to be
     parked in areas isolated from non-associated personnel and facilities. When such cargo is
     aboard, the PIC is responsible for ensuring the cargo is correctly identified to the tower or
     ground control. If the aircraft is not directed to an isolated area, identify the cargo again
     to tower or ground control. When identification is acknowledged, the host is solely
     responsible for selecting the parking area. Should host procedures be questionable,
     submit trip reports or hazard reports as appropriate, to document such occurrences.
     13.10.4.7. The military host is responsible for placarding aircraft. When missions
     operate on non-military bases, the briefing to the PIC will include placarding
     requirements and, if required, placards will be furnished at the on-load base. The shipper
     and receiver must make prior arrangements with the airport manager for shipments of
     hazardous materials requiring placarding. The shipper and receiver are responsible for
     cargo identification, fire fighting procedures, and isolated parking requirements.
     13.10.4.8. Unscheduled Landing Due to In-flight Emergency. Transmit unclassified
     information to the appropriate ATC facility as follows:
        13.10.4.8.1. Nature of emergency and intent to land.
        13.10.4.8.2. Aircraft position and ETA.

                                     FUEL PLANNING

14.1. General. This chapter provides general C-21 fuel planning considerations and procedures.
The planning procedures in this chapter apply to AMC, ANG, and USAFE units on AMC-
tasked, 618 TACC flight managed and 603 or 617 AMD flight managed missions in addition to
local missions flown by AMC units. Missions should be planned at altitudes, routes, and
airspeeds to minimize fuel usage. Publish local procedures in unit supplements to this AFI. Do
not use standard ramp fuel loads except for AE missions.
14.2. Fuel Conservation. It is Air Force policy to conserve aviation fuel when it does not
adversely affect training, flight safety, or operational readiness. Aircrew and mission planners
will manage aviation fuel as a limited commodity and precious resource. Fuel optimization will
be considered throughout all phases of mission planning and execution. Comply with the
following whenever consistent with technical order guidance and safety:
   14.2.1. Fuel Loads. Excessive ramp and recovery fuel adds to aircraft gross weight and
   increases fuel consumption. Do not ferry extra fuel beyond optimum requirements for safe
   mission accomplishment and training objectives.
   14.2.2. Flight Planning. Aircrew and mission planners will optimize flight plans and flight
   routing for fuel efficiency.
   14.2.3. Not used.
   14.2.4. Center-of-Gravity (CG). Load and maintain aircraft at an aft CG whenever possible
   consistent with mission requirements and Flight Manual restrictions.
   14.2.5. Taxi. Consider engine-out taxi when permitted by Flight Manual.
   14.2.6. Departure Planning. Consider use of opposite direction runway to reduce taxi and/or
   expedite departure routing if winds allow.
   14.2.7. Takeoff. Consider a rolling takeoff as well as reduced power when able. This saves
   fuel and engine wear. Clean up on schedule and don‘t delay gear and flap retraction.
   14.2.8. Climb/Descent. In-flight procedures such as climb/descent profiles and power
   settings should also be considered for efficient fuel usage.
   14.2.9. Weather Deviations. Attempt to coordinate for off-course deviation early so gross
   maneuvering is not required.
   14.2.10. Cruise techniques. Attempt to trim the aircraft and match throttle settings whenever
   possible. Fly fuel efficient speeds and altitudes to the maximum extent possible.
   14.2.11. Approach. Fly most direct routing to arrival approach consistent with mission
   requirements.
   14.2.12. Holding. If holding is required, hold clean at the most fuel efficient altitude and
   request a large holding pattern. Hold at endurance or performance manual recommended
   holding speeds, conditions permitting.
   14.2.13. Parking. Consider using shortest taxi route and avoid double blocking when able.
 146                                                    AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


14.3. Fuel Planning Procedures. Aircrew should employ the following aviation fuel
optimization measures without compromising flight safety or jeopardizing mission/training
accomplishment:
   14.3.1. Plan a 45-minute fuel reserve at destination or alternate (when an alternate is
   required).
   14.3.2. Plan fuel to an alternate only when AFI 11-202V3 or AFI 11-2C-21V3 require the
   filing of an alternate.
       14.3.2.1. When only one alternate is required, use the closest suitable airfield meeting
       mission requirements (such as special requirements for hazmat or patients) and 11-202V3
       weather criteria.
       14.3.2.2. If two alternates are required, use the two closest suitable airfields meeting 11-
       202V3 weather criteria and fuel plan to the more distant of the two.
       14.3.2.3. When selecting an alternate, suitable military airfields are preferred if within 75
       nautical miles of destination. (For 618 TACC provided fuel plans, the ACFP default
       distance to an alternate is 75 nautical miles. Consequently, where the alternate is less
       than 75 nautical miles from the primary destination, ACFP will assume that the airfield is
       75 nautical miles away.)
       14.3.2.4. The practice of selecting an alternate in another weather system or selecting an
       alternate based on maintenance capability will not be used.
       14.3.2.5. ACFP will provide a route of flight to the primary alternate if greater than 75
       miles from the destination.
       14.3.2.6. For remote destinations, holding is authorized in lieu of an alternate airport. In
       such situations, use 2+15 hrs reserve fuel (1+15 holding in lieu of an alternate, 0+45
       reserve, and 0+15 contingency fuel).
       14.3.2.7. Alternate selection is ultimately the Aircraft Commander‘s responsibility and
       should include multiple factors including landing fees, diplomatic relationships and
       availability of contract gas. Fuel savings should not compromise mission effectiveness.
   14.3.3. For all missions calculate an additional 15 minutes of contingency fuel to
   compensate for unforeseen circumstances during any phase of flight (i.e. unforecasted
   weather, launch delay, etc). Contingency fuel will not be considered reserve fuel since crews
   may burn some or all of their contingency fuel at any time during the mission. Compute
   using planned destination gross weight at 10,000 feet.
       14.3.3.1. AMC‘s ACFP will calculate reserves and contingency fuel as holding fuel.
       Computer flight plans will have 1+15 holding when combining 0+45 reserve and 0+15
       contingency fuel (for remote destinations ACFP will plan 2+00 holding plus 15 minutes
       contingency).
       14.3.3.2. Reserve and contingency fuel will be computed using consumption rates
       providing maximum endurance at 10,000 feet MSL at destination gross weight. If an
       alternate is required, compute using weight at alternate destination. When computing
       reserve and contingency fuel for remote destinations, use consumption rates providing
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                 147


       maximum endurance at 20,000 feet MSL. If an alternate is required, compute using
       weight at the alternate destination.
   14.3.4. Using all available planning tools (including ACFP) and guidance in this chapter,
   PICs will determine the RRFL.
   14.3.5. Tankering fuel for convenience is prohibited. MAJCOM C2 or TACC-sanctioned
   tankered fuel is deemed operationally necessary, and will be included in the RRFL.
   14.3.6. When there is a conflict between an on-time departure and defueling, the TACC or
   AMD deputy director of operations (DDO) or MAJCOM C2 equivalent will determine which
   takes precedence. The OG/CC will make this determination when serving as execution
   authority for the mission.
14.4. Fuel Requirements. See AFI 11-202V3 and NOTE below. This paragraph implements
standard minimum fuel requirements.
   14.4.1. Required ramp fuel will consist of all fuel required for engine start, taxi, takeoff,
   climb, cruise, alternate/missed approach (if required), descent, approach, transition, landing,
   and fuel reserve (holding fuel). Plan fuel load using computer flight plan or AF Form 70,
   Flight Plan, Table 14.1, and the flight manual (fuel plan not required on local training
   missions remaining within 200 NMs).
   14.4.2. Alternate fuel. Fuel for flight from intended destination to alternate aerodrome at
   optimum altitude and normal cruise speed. Compute fuel, time, and altitude from T.O. 1C-
   21A-1. When holding is required in lieu of an alternate at a remote or island destination,
   compute holding for 2+00 hours using planned destination gross weight at FL200. This
   provides 1+15 minutes holding fuel in addition to the 45 minute reserve requirement. A
   remote or island destination is defined as any aerodrome, which, due to its unique geographic
   location, offers no suitable alternate (civil or military). The forecast weather at the remote or
   island destination must meet the criteria listed in Chapter 6. NOTE: Plan initial arrival
   overhead destination with fuel for holding plus approach and landing or 1,000 pounds,
   whichever is greater. Additional fuel may be added to allow crews some flexibility when
   dealing with unplanned contingencies (e.g. weather avoidance, ATC delays, etc). When
   dealing with unplanned contingencies, crews will still plan to touchdown with fuel reserve
   (minimum). Units may develop standard alternate fuel requirements for local training
   missions; however, these fuel requirements will not be less than those specified in this
   chapter.

                                         OR
Alternate, based on VIS only criteria    Fuel for descent, approach, and missed approach; use
(see paragraph 6.20.) 2                  300 pounds + fuel from destination to alternate using
                                         climb and normal cruise charts
5. Holding 3                             0+45 fuel using holding charts at 10,000 feet. When
                                         holding in lieu of alternate is required (paragraph 6.20.)
                                         use 1+15 holding fuel computed at 20,000 feet
6. Approach and landing                  200 pounds
7. Known holding delays                  Fuel for planned holding when delays are anticipated
NOTES:
(1) Include all planned off-course maneuvering for departure or en route deviations.
(2). When two alternates are required, compute fuel from the destination to the most distant
alternate only.
(3) Minimum fuel required over destination or alternate is fuel for holding plus approach and
landing or 1,000 pounds, whichever is greater.
(4) Compliance with this chart ensures fuel reserve requirements in AFI11-202V3.

   14.4.3. Minimum fuel is 800 pounds. Crews should plan to terminate all missions with not
   less than 800 pounds (when required holding is 1+15 crews should ―plan‖ to land with
   approximately 1,000-1,200 lbs). When operating in FAA airspace, pilots will declare
   ―minimum fuel‖ to the controlling agency when in their judgment the aircraft may land at the
   intended destination with less than these amounts.
   14.4.4. Emergency fuel is 600 pounds. Crews will declare an emergency whenever it is
   determined that they will land with emergency fuel or less.
   14.4.5. Fuel Computations for CAT 1 Routing. When flying along a CAT 1 routing, crews
   should ensure they have enough fuel to complete the flight from the equal time point (ETP).
   Consider worst case recovery with one-engine inoperative or two-engine unpressurized.
   Calculate CAT I fuel reserve as 10% of flight time fuel over the CAT I route/route segment,
   not to exceed 1+00 fuel at normal cruise. NOTE: Crews must also ensure they have enough
   oxygen to continue from the ETP.
   14.4.6. Ballast fuel may be required under certain aircraft configurations to keep the center-
   of-gravity within flight limits. Unless the PIC can accurately determine when it is safe to
   transfer the ballast fuel forward, do not plan on utilizing this fuel during normal operations.
       14.4.6.1. Aircraft commanders will make every effort to work with their flight manager
       to resolve flight plan issues, RRFL.
       14.4.6.2. Aircraft commanders will not add any additional fuel without first discussing
       the reason with their flight manager (FM) and receiving the FM‘s agreement that
       additional fuel is justified.
       14.4.6.3. When an aircraft commander believes the fuel load is insufficient to execute the
       mission they will call the FM to identify and resolve differences. When the aircraft
       commander and FM do not reach agreement, the aircraft commander is the final authority
       for adding additional fuel.
   14.4.7. Local supplements will not dictate ―IAF‖ or ―Top of Descent Fuel‖.
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                149


  14.4.8. Where weather forecast conditions dictate, add only one of the following fuel
  corrections. Thunderstorm corrections are not cumulative. Use the highest applicable
  correction for the forecast of conditions.
     14.4.8.1. Fifteen minutes of fuel at enroute fuel burn rate (approximately 200lbs) if
     forecast thunderstorms are scattered or numerous along the route of flight.
     14.4.8.2. Eight minutes of fuel at enroute fuel burn rate (approximately 100lbs) if
     forecast thunderstorms are few along the route of flight.
     14.4.8.3. Five minutes of fuel at enroute fuel burn rate (approximately 50lbs) if forecast
     thunderstorms are isolated along the route of flight.
  14.4.9. Flight managers will include, in the ACFP, 15 minutes (appr. 200lbs) of East Coast
  hold down fuel for departures from Andrews, Dover, Martinsburg, McGuire, Stewart, and
  Westover. Hold down fuel is added as a departure bias and will be burned at the top of
  climb. Hold down fuel will be annotated on the ACFP as ―Fuel D‖ at the beginning of the
  ACFP and accounted for in the top of climb fuel block on the ACFP.
  14.4.10. Flight managers will include, in the ACFP, 15 minutes (appr. 200lbs) of early
  descent fuel for Andrews, Dover, Martinsburg, McGuire, Stewart, and Westover arrivals
  from the west.
  14.4.11. Early descent fuel is added as an arrival bias and will be burned on the last leg.
  Early descent fuel will be annotated on the ACFP as ―Fuel D‖ at the beginning of the ACFP
  and accounted for in the last leg fuel block on the ACFP.
  14.4.12. Depressurization Fuel: ACFP is currently incapable of calculating depressurization
  fuel. During all flight portions crews will discuss exercising depressurization procedures.
  Crews will calculate the fuel required to a recovery airfield in the event of depressurization at
  the ETP, to determine if additional fuel must be added to the ACFP RRFL. Plan to arrive at
  the recovery airfield with 0+30 minutes reserve fuel at optimal cruise speed for the
  depressurization transit altitude. Transit should be planned at 25,000 Feet MSL when
  passenger supplemental oxygen is available or 10,000 Feet MSL when passenger
  supplemental oxygen is not available.

NOTE: Certain technical information was intentionally omitted or generalized to keep this
chapter unclassified. Users should be aware that written additions to any portion of this
document could cause it to become classified.


17.1. General. Planners and aircrews should reference AFTTP 3-3.38A and AFTTP 3-1.38,
Tactical Employment of OSA/SAM/CSM/DVG (C-21, C-20, C-37, C-32, C-40), for additional
mission planning guidance.
17.2. Not used.
17.3. Tactical Airland Checklists. Amplified checklists applicable to airland operations are
posted on the AMC/A3V web site. In the absence of specific directives, the Combat Entry
Checklist is initiated prior to entering the threat environment. The Combat Entry Point is
determined by theater guidance or known/suspected weapons engagement zone (WEZ). In the
absence of more specific directives, initiate this checklist no later than 30 minutes prior to
entering the threat environment. If the aircraft will depart an airfield within a threat
environment, or will enter the threat environment within 1 hour after takeoff, the checklist should
be run prior to the line-up checklist. The Combat Exit Point is determined by theater
OPORD/SPINS guidance or known/suspected WEZ. Follow MAJCOM guidance for posting
checklist. This checklist may be placed in a MAJCOM approved flimsy.
17.4. Not used.
17.5. Not Used.
17.6. Not Used.
17.7. Approaches. Refer to AFTTP 3-3.38A for tactical approach techniques. Where multiple
options are available, select the approach which best minimizes exposure to the threat while still
allowing a high probability of landing on the first approach. Remain unpredictable.
   17.7.1. The tactical procedures and restrictions described below are detailed in AFTTP 3-
   3.38A and AFTTP 3-1.38. Accomplish all flight maneuvers with strict adherence to aircraft
   limitations as defined in T.O. 1C-21A-1 and this volume. Do not attempt any tactical
   maneuver that is not specifically mentioned in this publication without MAJCOM/A3/DO
   approval.
       17.7.1.1. Plan on intercepting the normal glide path no later than 1/2 mile prior to the
       landing runway, approximately 150 ft AGL. Normally, plan not to exceed 30° of bank
       when configured with flaps and/or gear. If greater bank angles are planned, do not
       exceed 45° of bank and compute stall speed for weight, configuration, and bank angle to
       be flown. Fly no slower than 1.3 times the stall speed for a given configuration.
       17.7.1.2. Although the FLAPS UP/PARTIAL FLAP LANDING checklist is in the
       emergency procedures pages of T.O. 1C-21A-1 and T.O. 1C-21A-1CL-1, Pilot’s
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                               153


       Abbreviated Flight Crew Checklist, it is not considered an emergency to fly a partial or
       no flap landing for tactical or other (i.e. wind shear, etc.) non-emergency operational
       considerations. This includes flying a partial or no flap landing for training.
          17.7.1.2.1. When performing a partial or no flap landing for training, tactical or other
          non-emergency operational considerations, ensure the FLAPS UP/PARTIAL FLAP
          LANDING checklist is accomplished prior to beginning the BEFORE LANDING
          checklist.
       17.7.1.3. The normal overhead pattern is not considered a tactical approach and may be
       flown at night and/or with passengers onboard.
17.8. Arrival Procedures. Consult AFTTP 3-3.38A and AFTTP 3-1.38 for specific
descriptions of the maneuvers listed in Table 17.1 below.
   17.8.1. Flight testing shows the best tactic for the C-21 is to fly at night. A night approach
   with no exterior lights illuminated and all passenger cabin shades closed renders the C-21
   virtually undetectable, even when flying a normal instrument approach.
       17.8.1.1. Not Used.
       17.8.1.2. Night tactics training is permitted with the landing lights turned off. All other
       exterior lights, including the Recognition Light, must be on during night tactics training
       IAW AFI 11-202V3.
          17.8.1.2.1. When flying a tactical approach with the landing lights turned off, the
          landing lights must be turned on when landing is assured. This applies to both
          training and operational missions.
   17.8.2. Passengers are not permitted when performing tactical maneuvers for training or
   currency. This restriction does not preclude performing tactical training maneuvers for
   currency or semi-annual training requirements on operational missions when no passengers
   are onboard (i.e. position/deposition legs).
       17.8.2.1. When performing tactical maneuvers for currency or semi-annual training on
       operational missions, both pilots must be certified and current in tactical maneuvers.

   17.10.1. Flight testing shows the best tactic for the C-21 is to fly at night. A night departure
   with no exterior lights illuminated and all passenger cabin shades closed renders the C-21
   virtually undetectable, even when flying a normal instrument departure.
   17.10.2. The landing lights must be turned on for all takeoffs, for both training and
   operational missions.
   17.10.3. Passengers are not permitted when performing tactical maneuvers for training or

                              AEROMEDICAL EVACUATION

20.1. Not Used.
   20.1.1. This chapter applies to Air Force C-21 Aircrews, AE Aircrews and all management
   levels concerned with operations of the C-21 aircraft. All operators involved in AE missions
   on C-21 aircraft will use this AFI.
   20.1.2. C-21 aircraft may be used for AE transport of ill or injured DOD members and their
   dependents. These AE missions may be directed at any time by C2 agencies. AE personnel
   will utilize the procedures in applicable AFI 11-2AE-V3 series and 41-307, in conjunction
   with this publication, to accomplish the AE mission.
20.2. Operational Control and Reporting of Aeromedical Evacuation Forces.
   20.2.1. HQ AMC is lead command for AE. HQ AMC Directorate of Operations (AMC/A3)
   is the executive agent for operational AE missions.
   20.2.2. Command and control of AE missions is the same as other airlift missions.
   20.2.3. The PIC is a qualified pilot responsible for command and control of all persons
   aboard the aircraft during an AE mission. In matters of flight safety, crew duty waivers, or
   operational considerations, his/her decisions are final. In matters of patient care, decisions of
   the Medical Crew Director (MCD) are final.
   20.2.4. Medical Crew Director. The MCD is a qualified flight nurse responsible for the
   overall supervision of patient care and management of AECMs assigned to AE missions.
   He/she advises the PIC on patients‘ conditions and the use of medical equipment that may
   affect aircraft operations. The MCD is directly responsible for the safety and medical well-
   being of patients on the aircraft and coordinates enplaning and deplaning procedures with
   supporting agencies. In matters of patient care, the decisions of the MCD are final.
20.3. Alerting Procedures.
   20.3.1. At all locations AMC C2 agency will alert the PIC/MCD. The MCD will alert the
   medical crew. The goal is to link the primary PIC, local AMC C2 agency and MCD before
   mission execution.
   20.3.2. When the AE crew is staged separate from the front-end crew, the MCD will contact
   AMC local C2 agency and establish alert, showtime, etc. with the C2 agency. The MCD will
   make every effort to communicate with the front-end crew any mission irregularities prior to
   crew rest. Utilize local AMC C2 agency to leave messages for non-emergency. Crew rest
   will be based on scheduled launch time. Do not violate crew rest.
   20.3.3. The local AMC C2 agency will provide PIC/MCD AE mission information when
   he/she checks on mission status. Local C2 agency will be the link between the AE crews and
   the PIC, thus permitting mission status updates to both parties without interruption of crew
   rest.
   20.3.4. AE mission requirements can change depending on clinical status of patient(s) and
   aircraft availability. There will be occasions when aircraft cannot depart (i.e. MX problems)
 158                                                   AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


   or emergency patient movement that may separate an AE crew from the front-end crew. The
   MCD is responsible for communicating these changes with the PIC and local AMC C2
   agency to de-conflict problems.
20.4. Pilot in Command Responsibilities.
   20.4.1. Establish communication link with the MCD during pre-mission planning and
   throughout the mission.
   20.4.2. Brief the AE crew on the mission, flight plan, flight profile, and current threat (as
   applicable).
   20.4.3. The PIC will fully integrate front-end and Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Members
   (AECM) into single crew through the entire mission to include en route transportation,
   dining, billeting, etc.
   20.4.4. Coordinate with MCD and C2 agencies for cabin altitude/flight restrictions based on
   patient requirements.
   20.4.5. For missions with combined cargo and patients, coordinate with the MCD for
   loading, positioning, and egress considerations.
   20.4.6. Comply with hazardous cargo/passenger restrictions in AFI 24-101, Passenger
   Movement.
   20.4.7. Advise AECMs of intentions to start engines, taxi, itinerary changes, in-flight
   difficulties, and additional responsibilities of the flight crew.
   20.4.8. Transmit load messages and radio transmissions to tasking AE C2 agency as
   requested by the MCD.
   20.4.9. Brief the MCD on additional responsibilities of the flight crew.
20.5. Flight Crew Responsibilities:

   The MCD will be on headset with the PIC during critical phases of flight and during in-flight
   emergencies.
   20.6.5. The CMT is responsible for all ground operations involved with patients. The CMT,
   in coordination with the loadmaster, is responsible for vehicle movement/positioning around
   the aircraft.
20.7. Ground Operations.
   20.7.1. Engines should be shut down during enplaning and deplaning of patients.
20.8. Refueling Operations.
   20.8.1. Refueling normally begins after deplaning patients are off the aircraft and prior to
   enplaning that station's patients.
      20.8.1.1. Simultaneous fuel and oxygen servicing is not authorized.
   20.8.2. Concurrent Ground Operations. Concurrent servicing (CS) is the simultaneous
   servicing of fuel or oxygen with or without patients on board while cargo loading/unloading
   or maintenance operations are being performed.
      20.8.2.1. The PIC and Chief Servicing Supervisor (CSS) shall ensure aircrew members
      and servicing personnel accomplish Concurrent Servicing (CS) per AFI 32-2001 The Fire
      Protection Operations and Fire Prevention Program and TO 00-25-172. The CSS will
      coordinate with all personnel involved prior to beginning concurrent operations.
      20.8.2.2. Prior to starting concurrent servicing, the total number of patients, passengers,
      and crew on board the aircraft will be given to the fire department.
      20.8.2.3. A current and qualified crewmember for the type of aircraft being serviced will
      be appointed as a Passenger Compartment Monitor (PCM) and shall continuously
      monitor patients/passengers during CS. PCMs will not perform other duties during
      servicing.
      20.8.2.4. The PCM will brief patients on emergency egress, exit prohibitions, and
      hazards. Ambulatory patients will remain seated but will not wear seatbelts during CS.
      When possible, the PCM should conduct the briefing prior to servicing.
      20.8.2.5. Loading ramps/stairs are in place for immediate use and exits (excluding the
      overhead escape hatches) are opened for egress.
      20.8.2.6. At least two qualified AECMs (one must be a FN) will remain onboard to
      observe patients and assist patients in the event of an egress.
      20.8.2.7. The PIC, designated aircrew representative, or CSS will advise PCMs and
      AECMs when to evacuate patients.
      20.8.2.8. Patients will not enter or exit the aircraft during servicing. Crewmembers may
      enter or exit the aircraft only when performing essential duties associated with the
 160                                                    AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


       concurrent servicing operation. Individuals must properly ground themselves before
       boarding the aircraft.
       20.8.2.9. If cabin lights, electrical power to operate medical equipment and aircraft inter-
       phone are operating prior to refueling, use may be continued during servicing operations
       provided it does not radiate energy. (Do not turn electronic equipment on or off during
       refueling.) EXCEPTION: Only those systems, switches or electrical circuits needed to
       operate equipment to sustain life, may be turned on and used during refueling.
       20.8.2.10. Activities around the aircraft will be kept to a minimum during the refueling
       process. Onload/Offload patient and passenger baggage prior to or after refueling.
       20.8.2.11. The PCM will set the interior lighting as bright as possible to suit the combat
       environment.
       20.8.2.12. Do not use the on board toilet facilities during servicing.
   20.8.3. CS on the C-21 is only recommended:
       20.8.3.1. If moving a critical patient would increase risk by an additional move off and
       back on the aircraft, or
       20.8.3.2. If there is no suitable location on the airfield to house the patient during the
       refueling, or
       20.8.3.3. If no suitable transportation (ambulance) is available to move the patient from
       the aircraft, or
       20.8.3.4. If the patient would be exposed to inclement weather.
   20.8.4. The aircraft door will be open during all phases of the refueling operation if patients
   remain onboard. External power may be applied and cockpit aeromed switches may be
   placed to the ON position prior to the start of refueling operations. However, medical life
   support equipment can still operate with all aircraft power removed during refueling
   operations.
   20.8.5. As an additional safety measure, the PIC will ensure a fire truck is near the aircraft
   before commencing concurrent refueling and one C-21 pilot must remain at the aircraft at all
   times during the refueling. Stable, ambulatory patients will routinely be deplaned prior to
   refueling if there is a suitable area to provide them shelter.
20.9. Aircraft Configuration.
   20.9.1. On dedicated AE missions, configure the aircraft during pre-flight.
   20.9.2. Litter Support Provisions.
       20.9.2.1. Load planning will be according to theater guidelines for C-21 aircraft.
       20.9.2.2. For patient transportation procedures refer to AFI 11-2AE V3 Addenda A.
   20.9.3. Available litter spaces and ambulatory seating will depend on the aircraft cabin‘s
   mission configuration.
   20.9.4. Therapeutic Oxygen. Unless the aircraft has the Spectrum or other approved system
   installed, therapeutic oxygen is not available and must be brought onboard for patient use. If
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                              161


   needed, use the Patient Therapeutic Liquid Oxygen (PTLOX) system or compressed oxygen
   cylinder.
   20.9.5. Integral patient/passenger emergency oxygen is not available on the aircraft. In the
   event of an emergency, patients and passengers will use the Emergency Passenger Oxygen
   System (EPOS).
   20.9.6. AECMs will have portable oxygen available. A MA-1 walk-around bottle satisfies
   the AECM oxygen requirement for pre-planned flights above FL350. The EPOS or EEBD
   can be used for preplanned flights below FL350 as a primary oxygen source.
   20.9.7. Do not secure aircraft or medical equipment adjacent to an emergency exit in a
   manner that will prevent or impede egress.
   20.9.8. Life Preservers. Use the Adult/Child life preserver for litter patients.
20.10. Passengers and Cargo.
   20.10.1. The PIC, with the concurrence of the MCD, will ensure maximum aircraft
   utilization for passengers and cargo. Passenger restrictions based upon patient considerations
   will be identified when seats are released. The PIC will advise the appropriate C2 agency of
   the number seats available for passengers.
   20.10.2. Cargo and passengers may be carried with patients unless a clear detriment to the
   health and well being of the patient or passengers can be demonstrated. The decision will be
   made by the MCD, considering the need for maximum utilization of the aircraft. Refer to
   AFMAN 24-204, Preparing Hazardous Materials for Air Shipments for hazardous product
   special provisions rating. P4 and P5 rated hazardous material have no AE restrictions.
   Conflicts will be referred to the respective tasking AE command element for decision. Litter
   patients will be positioned forward of cargo pallets. EXCEPTION: If cargo is in place, and
   the PIC and MCD agree, patients may be transported aft of the cargo. The MCD will ensure
   patient egress is not affected by mixed cargo/patient loads.
   20.10.3. Cargo will not be bumped except in unusual/abnormal cases, and only after the
   MCD has coordinated with the PIC and notified the tasking AE command element.
   20.10.4. Do not move ambulatory patients to litters in order to provide seating for additional
   patients or passengers.
   20.10.5. Patient Therapeutic Liquid Oxygen (PT LOX) may be transported for positioning
   and de-positioning AE Crews. A maximum of 25 PTLOX serviced units may be transported
   simultaneously without Hazmat certification. Processing through aerial port is not required.
   If shipping more than six PTLOX containers as cargo, do not cover with plastic. This will
   prevent potential high concentration of oxygen levels. WARNING: Ensure the cargo floor
   is free from any oil or petroleum products.
   20.10.6. AE Movement of Contaminated/Contagious Personnel. It is United States
   Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) policy that patients personnel, or casualties
   with known or suspected contamination from chemical, biological, or nuclear warfare agents
   will not be transported within the aeromedical patient movement system. Decontamination
   must be performed prior to transport to prevent the potential spread of contamination. In rare
   cases, transport may be essential to preserve life or continue critical missions. If such
   transport is deemed essential, all efforts must be made to prevent the spread of
 162                                                     AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


   contamination. In these cases, prior approval must be given by the involved geographic
   combatant commanders, Commander USTRANSCOM, and the Secretary of Defense
   (SECDEF) in consultation with Department of Defense medical authorities.
       20.10.6.1. Patients with known or suspected or highly contagious disease will not be
       transported within the patient movement system. These include infections with any agent
       that may pose a potential threat to national security, require special public health actions,
       and/or have the potential to cause public panic and social disruption. Patients known or
       suspected to be infected with a highly contagious disease should be treated ―in place‖ or
       with minimal transportation to medical authorities. In extreme circumstances there may
       be a requirement to move index cases (approximately two) for evaluation or critical
       medical care. If patient movement is required, prior approval must be given by the
       involved geographic combatant commanders, Commander USTRANSCOM, and
       SECDEF in consultation with medical authorities.
       20.10.6.2. AMC will train and equip AE crews and stage required equipment at key hubs
       to carry out these limited missions for movement of contaminated and contagious
       patients. NOTE: If AECMs are utilizing the MCU-2A ground chemical mask, a FL
       below 10,000 feet is recommended due to reported valve failure during rapid
       decompression.
20.11. Crash/Fire/Rescue.
   20.11.1. Aircraft carrying patient(s) will be provided CFR protection per TO 00-25-172.
   When concurrent fuel servicing with patients/passengers on board a major aircraft rescue and
   fire vehicle will be available to respond within three minutes or as determined by the base
   Fire Chief. NOTE: When servicing with JP-4 or Jet B Fuel, a major aircraft rescue and fire
   vehicle will be positioned at the aircraft. The flight crew will coordinate CFR requirements.
   20.11.2. At non-AMC bases, non-U.S. military bases, and civilian airfields, the controlling
   agency will coordinate the CFR coverage, as necessary. The request for CFR vehicle
   coverage may be denied. This will not prevent refueling operations from occurring.
20.12. AE Call Sign/Use of Priority Clearance. If a medical emergency occurs during flight,
and is determined by the MCD to be an urgent situation, a request for AIR EVAC Priority will
be requested. The PIC may request ―AIR EVAC priority‖ for preferential ATC handling if a
delay will affect a patient‘s well being. AIR EVAC priority will only be used for that portion of
the flight requiring expedited handling. Do not request priority for routine air evacuations to
avoid ATC delays or inconveniences. It is the PIC‘s responsibility to use this option only for
bona fide medical situations that demand priority handling. Use this status judiciously.
20.13. Load Message.
   20.13.1. The MCD will complete an AF Form 3858, C-130/C-141 Aeromedical Evacuation
   Mission Offload Message and coordinate for transmission of patient information to C2 a
   minimum of 30 minutes prior to estimated time of arrival.
20.14. Patient Death In-Flight.
   20.14.1. If a suspected death of a patient occurs in-flight, the planned itinerary will not be
   interrupted if the next scheduled stop is a US military airfield. If the next stop is a civilian
   airfield that does not service a US military medical facility, or a foreign military airfield, that
AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                              163


   stop will be overflown (mission requirements allowing). Coordination with command and
   control is essential.
20.15. SPECTRUM 500-LP (Military Version) Model 2500 US. The Spectrum 500 LP is the
current unit approved for use on C-21 aeromedical evacuation missions. The litter system has
self-contained oxygen, vacuum, compressed air, electrical power and an overhead light. This unit
plugs directly into aircraft power. The aircraft manufacturer will normally install the
SPECTRUM on the right side of the aircraft with the closet removed.
   20.15.1. Specifications.

20.16. Loading Instructions for Neonatal Transport System (NTS) onto SPECTRUM.
   20.16.1. Ensure all loading crew members, including pilot, are briefed and fully understand
   loading procedures and individual responsibilities.
   20.16.2. NTS must be the sled unit. Ensure NTS sled unit is strapped in place, on support
   gurney.
   20.16.3. Loading may require five individuals: one aircrew member to guide unit from
   inside the aircraft, and four individuals to slowly slide unit up ramp from outside aircraft
   (three will usually be the NCCAT team, plus an ambulance or flight crew member). The
   aircraft will be prepared with the SPECTRUM-specific loading ramp placed into the
   appropriate location with bolt in front of ramp inserted into hole at head of the SPECTRUM
   base unit. Ensure the ramp is angled such that it does not touch the sides of the doorway, and
   does not contact the toilet in front of the SPECTRUM unit.
164                                                     AFI11-2C-21V3 24 SEPTEMBER 2010


  20.16.4. If available, the triangular ramp extension should be secured to SPECTRUM unit
  and ramp, extending toward the seat directly across from SPECTRUM unit.
  20.16.5. Remove seat cushions from forward left passenger seat.
  20.16.6. The legs of the ramp must be placed into the steel support stand. The ramp should
  be in the high position (the height is adjustable), such that it is similar in height to the gurney
  at full-up position. The gurney is wheeled into place, with the monitors of the NTS facing
  toward the rear of the plane (the rubber wheel will be at the front left when the gurney is
  pulled up to the ramp).
  20.16.7. Release the support straps of the sled to the gurney.
  20.16.8. The four members of the team will slowly advance the sled up the ramp. The
  gurney may be pulled away when the sled is completely on the ramp. The two members
  closest to the cabin door will exercise caution not to damage the doorframe and left, forward
  seat armrest when loading. The flight crewmember on-board must be obeyed for changes in
  tempo of loading (this will minimize chance of damaging the far inside wall).
  20.16.9. Once stabilized on the ramp, the aft left loading crew member will follow the aft
  end of the NTS into the aircraft to help guide the unit in and lock into the base.
  20.16.10. The flight crewmember will ensure that the sled angles onto the base unit as it
  advances.
  20.16.11. The remaining outside member and loading crew member mentioned in step 9 will
  remove the ramp and supplement lateral support after the NTS sled is securely on the base
  unit.
  20.16.12. The sled should now be secured to the base unit by the spring loaded metal plate
  mechanism on each end.
  20.16.13. The power cord should be inserted into the spectrum power outlet.
  20.16.14. When entire team is loaded, have ramp and lateral stabilizer supplement up and
  placed on board for use at next stop.
  20.16.15. For deplaning NTS, reverse the steps as appropriate.
