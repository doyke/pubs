 Scoring Process:                * NOTE: NO TWO NOMINEES CAN RECEIVE THE SAME SCORE *

   1. When scoring, please review the entire nomination package to ensure you get a whole-package
view.

  2. Score the candidate's package using the 6.5 to 10 point scale. Use of tenths is highly
encouraged (i.e. 6.5, 6.6, 6.7),
     therefore as a board member, distinguish between nominees; no two nominees should
receive the same score.
     Document your score for that candidate on the "score" column above.

   3. Merit Rank Order your candidates. The member with the highest total score is rated #1, next
highest score is #2, etc.
      Document your rank order score on the "merit rank order" column above.
