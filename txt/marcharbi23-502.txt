This volume establishes procedures for processing recoverable and unusable fuel in accordance
with Air Force Policy Directive 23-5, Reusing and Disposing of Materiel, 16 April 1993, and Air
Force Instruction 23-502, Section B, Paragraph 6.3.3, Recoverable and Unusable Liquid
Petroleum Products, 6 April 1994. It applies to all 452d AMW and 163d ARW Maintenance
Units.

1. Generating Activity: The generating activity is responsible for ensuring the recovery of
usable fuel collected within their respective area.

1.1 Units will collect fuel in an approved bowser until proper disposition can be determined.

1.2 At the required interval, deliver the bowser to Building 1270 for laboratory testing and
provide the Fuels Control Center, extension 4188, with the following information:

1.2.1 Bowser identification number.

1.2.2. Owning organization

1.2.3. Point of contact and telephone number.

1.3. Upon the notification of the test results, pickup the bowser for disposition of the product.

1.3.1. If the product is usable, deliver the bowser to the 452d Aerospace Ground Equipment's
(AGE) Facility 437 (Organizational Tank) for draining.

NOTE: Once the responsible unit has been notified that the content of the bowser is reclaimable
for AGE fuel usage, the responsible unit is then required to coordinate the AGE personnel (ext.
2611) to return the fuel to the appropriate AGE tank(s). AGE personnel will monitor its tank
while the responsible unit will monitor the bowser during the transfer of the fuel. Spill kits and
materials must be available and accessible in the immediate area during transfer. Caution must
be taken to prevent spills and/or leakage that may result in contaminated storm water.

1.3.2. If the product is not usable, process as hazardous waste in accordance with the Base
Hazardous Management Plan.

2. Fuels Management Flight: The Fuels Management Flight assists generating activities in
determining the disposition of petroleum products collected in fuel bowsers.

2.1 When notified of a fuel bowser being delivered, the Fuels Control Center (FCC) and the
Quality Control and Inspection Element (QC and I) takes the following actions:

2.1.1. The FCC records the information specified in paragraph 1.2 and advises the QC and I
accordingly.

2.1.2. The QC and I draws the necessary sample, performs the required laboratory tests and
advises the FCC of the test results.

2.1.3. The FCC contacts the generating activity and advises of the test results for subsequent
actions required by paragraph 1.3.

2.2. Fuels Accounting: Upon completion of the recovery of the usable fuel and receipt of AF
Form 1994 from 452 AGR, the generating activity is credited for the amount of fuel recovered.

3. 452 AGE Shop: The 452 AGE shop coordinates with the generating activity for delivery of
usable fuel.

3.1. Assist with draining the bowser into the appropriate organizational tank.

3.2. Prepare an AF Form 1994 for amount of fuel received.

3.3. Forward documentation to Fuels Accounting for processing.
