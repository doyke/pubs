                                    MISSION PLANNING

2.1. Responsibilities. The responsibility for mission planning is shared jointly by all flight
members as well as the ops and intel functions in the unit.
2.2. General Procedures.
   2.2.1. Planning. Accomplish sufficient flight planning to ensure safe mission execution to
   include fuel requirements, map preparation, and takeoff and landing data (TOLD) (USAFE:
   For sorties landing at other than home-station, reference AFI 11-202V3_USAFESUP_I,
   Attachment 4, CONTROL OF FIGHTER/ATTACK AIRCRAFT FOR OFF STATION
   SORTIES/DIVERT). Consider foreseeable safety risks and adopt risk mitigation factors in
   accordance with Operational Risk Management (ORM).
   2.2.2. Standards. The SQ/CC is the approval authority for squadron standards. OG/CC
   may publish and approve group or wing standards. Ops Group Stan/Eval (OGV) will review
   all standards for compliance with AFI 11-series guidance.
2.3. Unit Developed Checklists and Local Aircrew Aids.
   2.3.1. Unit developed checklists may be used in lieu of flight manual checklists (except -25
   checklists) provided they contain, as a minimum, all items (verbatim and in order) listed in
   the applicable checklist.
   2.3.2. Units will produce an aircrew aid that, as a minimum, includes:
       2.3.2.1. Briefing guides (reference Briefing Guide Attachments in this volume).
       2.3.2.2. Local radio channelization and airfield diagrams.
       2.3.2.3. Impoundment procedures, emergency action checklists, and No Radio
       (NORDO)/divert information.
       2.3.2.4. Arresting gear information for divert bases.
       2.3.2.5. Bailout and jettison areas and On-Scene Commander (OSC) checklist.
       2.3.2.6. Cross-country procedures to include: command and control, engine
       documentation, Joint Oil Analysis Program (JOAP) samples, and aircraft servicing.
       2.3.2.7. Other information as deemed necessary by the units (i.e. stereo flight plans, local
       training area diagrams, local area maps of sufficient detail to provide situational
       awareness on area boundaries).
2.4. Flight Material Preparation.
   2.4.1. Mission Data Card. TOLD will be annotated on mission data cards.
       2.4.1.1. The minimum TOLD required is maximum abort speed for expected conditions
       (i.e. dry/wet/icy), rotation/Nose Wheel Lift Off (NWLO)/takeoff speed, takeoff distance,
       single engine rotation/NWLO/SETOS, and normal/heavy weight landing distance.
10                        AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010


        2.4.1.2. The most current version of Technical Orders (TO) 1F-15E-1-1, Flight Manual
        Performance Data USAF Series F-15E Aircraft and 1F-15E-1CL-1 Flight Crew
        Checklist USAF Series F-15E Aircraft are the authorized sources for calculating TOLD.
        2.4.1.3. Pre-calculated or automated (e.g. JMPS) data may only be used for TOLD if
        verified against the information in these TOs.
           2.4.1.3.1. Unit developed tabular data must be verified against the TOs and will
           include a date and signature block of the aircrew verifying it as correct.
           2.4.1.3.2. OPR for certification of TOLD in automated systems is ACC/A8SM. OPR
           for revocation of certification due to TO change is ACC/A3TV. Units will be
           informed of revocation via MAJCOM Flight Crew Information File (FCIF) message.
 2.4.2. Local Area Maps. A separate local area map is not required if the unit aircrew aid
 provides a local area map IAW para 2.3.2.7 (USAFE: on flights from a deployed location,
 each aircrew will have available a local map annotated with designated flying areas,
 emergency airfields, buffer zones, control zones, and restricted or danger areas if this
 information is not available in a deploy-location aircrew aid).
 2.4.3. Charts. Flight Information Publications (FLIP) en route charts may be used instead
 of maps on navigational flights within areas that are adequately covered by these charts.
     2.4.4. Low Altitude Maps.
        2.4.4.1. On all low altitude flights, each aircraft in the flight will contain a minimum of
        one Chart Handbook Manual (CHUM) updated map of the low altitude route or training
        areas. The map will be of a scale and quality that terrain features, hazards, and chart
        annotations are of sufficient detail to allow navigation and safe mission accomplishment.
        2.4.4.2. Annotate time or distance tick marks and headings. Highlight all manmade
        obstacles at or above the planned flight altitude.
        2.4.4.3. Annotate all maps with a Route Abort Altitude (RAA). Compute the RAA for
        the entire route/area at a minimum of 1,000 feet (2000’ in mountainous terrain) above the
        highest obstacle/terrain (rounded up to the next 100 feet) within the lateral limits of the
        route or training area, but in no case less than 5NM either side of planned route.
           2.4.4.3.1. Mountainous terrain is designated by FAR 95.11.
           2.4.4.3.2. When operating outside US domestic airspace any terrain above 3,000 ft.
           MSL will be considered mountainous terrain.
        2.4.4.4. Terrain Following (TF) Flight Map Preparation. In addition to the low
        altitude map requirements listed above:
           2.4.4.4.1. Annotate a Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA) for each leg of the intended
           route of flight. MSA is defined as an altitude that provides 1000 feet of clearance
           above the highest obstacle/terrain (rounded up to the next 100 feet) within 5NM of
           the planned course.
           2.4.4.4.2. Annotate maximum and minimum route structure altitudes if applicable.
           2.4.4.4.3. To ensure maps accurately display planned routes, TF turn point bank
           angles must reflect realistic systems limitations.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010                                                 11


           2.4.4.4.4. In order to verify proper operation of the TF system, TF letdown corridors
           for the primary (and alternate, if applicable) entry points for low level routes will be
           computed and briefed. As a minimum, compute MSA and Recovery Initiation
           Altitude (RIA) as well as values for terrain at 1 NM and command level off.
           2.4.4.4.5. For night TF missions select letdown points that avoid initial descents into
           rugged or mountainous terrain (defined by TO 1F-15E-1 as any vertical change that
           exceeds 900 ft/NM).
   2.4.5. (CONUS Only)Aircrew members flying under VFR or inside MTRs will supplement
   existing mission planning materials (e.g. CHUM, FLIP AP/1B, etc.) with at least one of the
   following:
       2.4.5.1. JMPS (or FalconView if JMPS is not available) chart with the following overlay
       options selected: airports/heliports, airspace boundaries with approach control
       frequencies annotated, airways, MTR, parachute jump, and Special Use Airsapce (SUA)
       boundaries.
       2.4.5.2. Sectional Aeronautical Charts (SAC) (use in flight is not required) and
       1:250,000 low level charts/route books annotated with location and dimensions of class
       A/B/C/D airspace, civil/military airfields and other potential high density traffic areas
       (e.g., parachute activity areas and ultra light/hang-glider/glider sites, etc.) within 5 NM of
       any planned VFR route or MTR.
           2.4.5.2.1. Applicable airfield approach control frequencies in the vicinity of class A,
           B, C, and D airspace will be annotated and briefed on all such flights.
           2.4.5.2.2. In addition, annotate and brief the intersection of other Visual Routes (VR)
           or Instrument Routes (IR) (if applicable) and any other possible areas of conflict.
   2.4.6. Aircrew members flying outside CONUS will follow gaining MAJCOM, theater, or
   host nation guidance on mission planning (USAFE: reference AFI 11-
   202V3_USAFESUP_I, para. 2.1). If no gaining MAJCOM, theater, or host nation guidance
   exists, use the best charts or MPS overlay options available to accomplish the above
   requirements.
2.5. Fuel Conservation. Design procedures for optimal fuel use and efficiency throughout all
phases of mission execution. Incorporate enroute tasks to maximize use of airborne training
opportunities.
2.6. Preflight Brief.
   2.6.1. All flight crewmembers and passengers must attend the flight brief unless previously
   coordinated with unit supervisors.
   2.6.2. Anyone not attending the flight brief must receive, as a minimum, a brief on mission
   events and emergency procedures (EP) prior to step.
   2.6.3. Flight leads/instructors are responsible for presenting a logical brief which will
   promote safe and effective mission accomplishment.
       2.6.3.1. Ensure brief start time provides adequate time to discuss required items and
       accounts for mission complexity. As a minimum, begin briefs at least 1.5 hours before
12                     AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010


     scheduled takeoff. Alert briefs will start in sufficient time to be completed prior to
     aircrew changeover.
     2.6.3.2. Structure the brief to accommodate the capabilities of each flight member.
     2.6.3.3. Ensure contracts, roles, and responsibilities of each flight member are
     established, briefed, and debriefed.
     2.6.3.4. Include mission priorities, significant rules (e.g. Rules of Engagement [ROE],
     Special Instructions [SPINS], Training Rules [TRs]), task management, weather,
     NOTAMs, and EPs.
     2.6.3.5. Ensure a formation deconfliction, blind, and get well plan for every phase of
     flight is briefed and every flight member understands the plan (use para 3.10 as a
     baseline). All flight members are responsible for executing this plan.
     2.6.3.6. Review TOLD and ensure every member of the flight understands it. Place
     particular emphasis on takeoff abort factors during abnormal situations such as short or
     wet runway, heavy gross weights, non-standard cable configurations, and abort sequence
     in formation flights.
     2.6.3.7. Include the following special subjects: radar and visual search responsibilities
     during departure/enroute/recovery, high density traffic areas, mid-air collision avoidance
     both from other military aircraft as well as civilian aircraft.
     2.6.3.8. Include flight responsibilities, proper formation position (to ensure adequate
     wingtip clearance), and aircraft-unique requirements for each phase of flight when
     dissimilar aircraft or aircraft configurations are flown in the same formation.
     2.6.3.9. For missions using Night Vision Goggles (NVG), emphasize proper tuning, use,
     and limitations.
     2.6.3.10. Low Altitude Mission Briefs.
        2.6.3.10.1. Emphasize low altitude flight maneuvering, obstacle and ground
        avoidance, Low Altitude Warning System (LAWS) features and limitations, low
        altitude comfort level, and complacency avoidance.
        2.6.3.10.2. For low altitude training over water and featureless terrain, include
        specific considerations with emphasis on minimum altitudes and spatial
        disorientation.
        2.6.3.10.3. For low-level missions using TF, emphasize proper setup as well as both
        ground and air checks of the TF system, procedures for transitioning from medium
        altitude to low-level TF, and TF maneuvering limitations.
        2.6.3.10.4. For low-level missions using TF in conjunction with NVGs, emphasize
        the inherent limitations of both systems and the necessary maneuvering restrictions
        that each imposes.
     2.6.3.11. Alternate Mission Briefs. Brief an appropriate alternate mission for each
     flight.
        2.6.3.11.1. The alternate mission must be less complex than the primary and should
        parallel the primary mission (e.g. Basic Fighter Maneuvers as alternate for Air
AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010                                                 13


          Combat Maneuvers, Basic Surface Attack for Surface Attack Tactics, Tactical
          Intercepts for Defensive Counter Air).
          2.6.3.11.2. If the alternate mission does not parallel the planned mission, brief the
          specific mission elements that are different.
          2.6.3.11.3. Mission elements may be modified and briefed airborne as long as flight
          safety is not compromised. Flight leads will ensure changes are acknowledged by all
          flight members.
          2.6.3.11.4. Do not fly unbriefed (either on the ground or in the air) missions or
          events.
       2.6.3.12. Briefing Guides.
          2.6.3.12.1. Reference the attachments to this AFI for basic briefing guide examples.
          2.6.3.12.2. Subjects may be briefed in any sequence.
          2.6.3.12.3. Those items published in AFIs, Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and
          Procedures manuals (AFTTP) or unit standards and understood by all participants
          may be briefed as ―st
                              andard.‖
   2.6.4. Multiple Sortie Days.
       2.6.4.1. If all flight members attend an initial or mass flight brief, the flight lead on
       subsequent flights need brief only those items that have changed from the previous
       flight(s).
       2.6.4.2. On multiple-go days when aircraft turn times do not allow follow-on mission
       brief(s) and only the initial flight brief is accomplished for all gos, the following guidance
       applies:
          2.6.4.2.1. Upgrade missions will be flown on the first sortie (second sortie if the first
          is non-effective for weather, maintenance, or airspace availability).
          2.6.4.2.2. Subsequent missions will be of equal or less complexity with no additional
          upgrade training, unless approved by OG/CC.
          2.6.4.2.3. Participants in continuation training (CT) missions may fly their primary or
          alternate missions in any sequence.
2.7. Postflight Debrief.
   2.7.1. All missions will be debriefed.
   2.7.2. All flight debriefs will include, at a minimum, the in-flight execution of flight member
   responsibilities, deconfliction contracts, tactical employment priorities, and task
   management.

                                             Chapter 3

                            NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

Section 3A—Ground Operations

3.1. Preflight.
   3.1.1. Do not carry baggage or equipment in an unoccupied rear cockpit (EXCEPTION:
   Forms and maps may be stowed in the map case).
   3.1.2. The pilot will brief the ground crew as required. Prior to starting, the pilot will get an
   ―okay‖ signal from the rear cockpit occupant. Use operational headsets to the maximum
   extent possible during all engine start and pre-taxi checks as well as when technicians are
   performing tasks on the aircraft. Hand signals may be used as a last resort or if required
   during alert scramble or combat operations.
   3.1.3. In lieu of higher guidance (i.e. theater SPINS) flying units will specify a standard
   setting for the ejection seat radio beacon auto/manual selector switch.
   3.1.4. Select Pressure Breathing (PBG) on all sorties except those using Aircrew Eye and
   Respiratory Protection System (AERPS) or Aircrew Chemical Defense Equipment (ACDE).
   3.1.5. The use of the COMBAT EDGE vest is optional in the F-15E. If aircrew elect to fly
   with the COMBAT EDGE vest they will remove the port plug on the CRU-94 (if installed),
   properly stow the plug during flight to prevent a FOD hazard, then re-install upon completion
   of the sortie.
   3.1.6. During the Before Taxi flight control checks, confirm the proper movement and
   position of the flight control surfaces with the crew chief.
3.2. Ground Visual Signals. When ground intercom is not used, use visual signals IAW AFI
11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movements on the Ground and this volume. All signals
pertaining to operation of aircraft systems will originate with the pilot. The crew chief will
repeat the given signals when it is safe to operate the system. Aircrew should not activate any
system that could pose a danger to the ground crew prior to receiving proper acknowledgment
from ground personnel. The following signals augment AFI 11-218.
      3.2.1. Jet Fuel Starter (JFS) Start: With clenched fist, pilot makes a pulling motion.
   3.2.2. Flight Controls Check: Raise arm, clench fist, and make a stirring motion.
   3.2.3. Brake Check: Hold left or right arm horizontal, open hand and push forward,
   breaking at the wrist (as in applying rudder pedal pressure with feet).
   3.2.4. Digital Electronic Engine Control (DEEC), Improved Digital Electronic Engine
   Control (IDEEC)/Automatic Thrust Departure Prevention System (ATDPS)
   Check: With the fingers and thumb of each hand extended and joined at the tips, open and
   close the fingers and thumbs of both hands simultaneously, simulating nozzle opening and
   closing.
   3.2.5. Target Pod Clear: Extend arm and rotate a closed fist in a circular motion.
   3.2.6. Loss of Brakes While Taxiing: Lower tailhook.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010                                               15


3.3. Taxi and Quick Check/Arming.
   3.3.1. The minimum taxi interval is 150 feet staggered or 300 feet in trail. Spacing may be
   reduced when holding short of or entering the runway.
   3.3.2. Do not taxi during snow or icy conditions until the taxi route and runway have been
   checked for safe conditions. In this case, taxi on the centerline with a minimum of 300 feet
   spacing. The minimum Runway Condition Reading (RCR) for taxi operations is 10.
   OG/CCs may waive this to RCR 8.
   3.3.3. Maximum taxi speed during sharp turns (more than 45 degrees of turn) is 10 knots.
   Above 10 knots the aircraft may skid or depart the three point attitude.
   3.3.4. At non-USAF bases aircrew will make every attempt to coordinate for a rollover/End
   of Runway (EOR) inspection with the host maintenance unit.
   3.3.5. Keep hands in view of ground personnel during quick check, arming, and de-arming
   operations. If the intercom system is not used during EOR checks, the pilot will establish and
   maintain visual contact with the ground personnel to allow the use of visual signals.
   3.3.6. Do not taxi in front of any aircraft arming or de-arming forward firing ordnance.
3.4. Flight Lineup. Flights will line up as appropriate based on weather, runway conditions,
and runway width.
   3.4.1. When separating elements use a minimum of 500 feet spacing between elements.
   3.4.2. For formation takeoffs wingmen must maintain wingtip clearance with their element
   lead.
   3.4.3. If runway width precludes line-up with wingtip clearance between all aircraft in the
   flight, use 500 feet spacing between elements or delay run-up until the preceding aircraft or
   element releases brakes.
3.5. Before Takeoff Checks. After arming and prior to takeoff all flight members will inspect
each other for proper configuration and any abnormalities.

Section 3B—Takeoff and Departure

3.6. Takeoff.
   3.6.1. Do not takeoff if the RCR is less than 12. OG/CCs may waive this to RCR 8.
   3.6.2. On training missions, do not takeoff if the computed takeoff roll exceeds 80 percent of
   the available runway. For single-ship takeoffs, if the single-ship computed mil-power takeoff
   distance exceeds one-half of the available runway, takeoff using afterburner.
   3.6.3. When operating from airfields equipped with a compatible, remotely operated cable,
   ensure the departure end cable is raised for all takeoffs and landings, unless another departure
   end cable is in place.
   3.6.4. Use a minimum of 10 seconds (15 seconds when using afterburners) takeoff interval
   between aircraft or elements.
   3.6.5. Use a minimum of 20 seconds takeoff interval when carrying live air-to-surface
   ordnance (N/A for 20mm ammunition) or when performing a radar trail departure.
 16                       AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010


   3.6.6. Pilots will steer toward the center of the runway at the start of the takeoff roll.
   3.6.7. OG/CCs may approve intersection takeoffs.
   3.6.8. Do not takeoff over any raised web barrier (e.g. MA-1A, 61QS11) or loose/slack cable
   (e.g. BAK-12/13/14).
   3.6.9. Suspected Hot Brake Speeds.
       3.6.9.1. Unit commanders will ensure Suspected Hot Brake speeds are re-calculated
       during Hot Pit or Quick Turn operations.
       3.6.9.2. A takeoff abort made when adequate brake cooling time is not met (usually
       within one hour of landing) can place the aircraft into the Brake Energy Caution Zone
       with brake applications as low as 80 kts (TO 1F-15E-1, Flight Manual--F-15E Section
       5). Use the following guidance:
          3.6.9.2.1. Absorbed energy from landings made one hour or less prior to subsequent
          takeoffs will be added in full.
          3.6.9.2.2. Use a maximum of 20 million foot-pounds to calculate the abort speed
          where suspected hot brakes will be declared.
3.7. Formation Takeoff.
   3.7.1. Formation takeoffs are restricted to elements of two aircraft.
   3.7.2. Elements must be led by a qualified flight lead unless an Instructor Pilot (IP) is in the
   element.
   3.7.3. Aircraft must be within 3,000 pounds of each other and symmetrically loaded.
   Consider symmetrically loaded as those store loadings that do not require an abnormal trim
   or control application to counter a roll or yaw during takeoff and acceleration to climb
   airspeed.
   3.7.4. Do not make formation takeoffs when:
       3.7.4.1. The runway width is less than 125 feet.
       3.7.4.2. The Runway Surface Condition (RSC) is reported as wet, or ice, slush, or snow
       is on the runway. OG/CCs may waive this requirement if the center 125 feet of the
       runway is clear of standing water, ice, slush or snow.
       3.7.4.3. The crosswind component exceeds 15 knots.
       3.7.4.4. Loaded with live air to ground munitions.
       3.7.4.5. Ferrying aircraft from a contractor or Air Logistics Center (ALC) facility.
   3.7.4.6. The computed takeoff roll exceeds 50% of the available runway.
3.8. Initial Join-up and Rejoins.
   3.8.1. Minimum day weather criteria for a VFR join-up underneath: ceiling 1,500 feet,
   visibility 3 miles (5 KM).
   3.8.2. Flight leads will maintain TO climb speeds until join-up is accomplished unless
   mission requirements necessitate a different airspeed.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010                                             17


   3.8.3. Flight leads should limit their angle of bank to 30 degrees for turning rejoins
   immediately after takeoff.
   3.8.4. For further join-up procedures, see para 3.31 (Night) and para 4.2 (Instruments).

Section 3C—Enroute

3.9. Formation, General. Flight leads/instructors are responsible for ensuring contracts, roles
and responsibilities of each flight member are established and executed.
   3.9.1. If any flight member cannot fulfill their basic responsibilities, contracts, or other
   assigned tasks, they will immediately communicate that information to the flight or element
   lead.
   3.9.2. For additional formation considerations, reference AFTTP 3-3.F15E and AFTTP 3-
   1.F-15E, Tactical Employment—F-15E (Secret).
   3.9.3. IMC. In IMC the maximum flight size is four aircraft except when flying in close
   formation with a tanker (refer to TO 1-F15E-1, Section VIII Air Refueling Procedures and
   Allied Tactical Publication (ATP)-56(B), Air-to-Air Refueling).
   3.9.4. Maneuvers. Do not use rolling maneuvers to maintain or regain formation position
   below 5,000 feet Above Ground Level (AGL) or outside of SUA (USAFE: Consider SUA as
   anytime the aircraft is under Basic, Traffic, or Deconfliction Service).
   3.9.5. Signals. Airborne visual signals will be in accordance with AFI 11-205, Aircraft
   Cockpit and Formation Flight Signals. For four-ship flights, formation changes will be
   initiated by radio call when practical. When formation position changes are directed by radio
   all wingmen will acknowledge prior to initiating the change. A radio call is mandatory when
   directing position changes at night or in IMC.
   3.9.6. Recovery. When circumstances permit, flight leads will direct a battle damage (BD)
   check after each mission prior to or during Return to Base (RTB). This check is mandatory
   following the expenditure of any ordnance (including all types of 20mm ammunition) except
   at night or in IMC. Brief deconfliction responsibilities and position change procedures.
   3.9.7. Breakups. Flight leads will not break up formations until each wingman has a
   positive fix from which to navigate (i.e. visual, Inertial Navigation System [INS], Embedded
   GPS/INS [EGI], or Tactical Air Navigation [TACAN])
   3.9.8. Changing Leads. Lead changes require a clear transfer of responsibilities from one
   flight member to another.
       3.9.8.1. Lead changes will be initiated and acknowledged with either a radio call or
       visual signal.
       3.9.8.2. Ensure deconfliction is established before initiating a lead change.
       3.9.8.3. The lead change is effective upon acknowledgment.
       3.9.8.4. All flight members must continue to ensure aircraft separation during position
       changes.
       3.9.8.5. When flying in limited visibility conditions, initiate lead changes from a
       stabilized, wings level attitude.
 18                         AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010


         3.9.8.6. The minimum altitude for a lead change is 500 feet AGL over land or 1,000 feet
         AGL over water (for night see para 3.22.4.2., for IMC see para 4.6)
         3.9.8.7. When conducting lead changes from fingertip, route, spread, or tactical, do not
         initiate lead changes with the wingman further aft than 30 degrees from line abreast.
3.10. Formation Deconfliction.
   3.10.1. General. Apply the following rules for flight path deconfliction during tactical
   maneuvering:
         3.10.1.1. Flight leads will consider wingman/position and ability to safely perform a
         maneuver before directing it.
         3.10.1.2. Trailing aircraft and elements are responsible for deconfliction from the lead
         aircraft and elements. Wingmen and elements will deconflict vertically from the
         lead/lead element to the max extent practical. During low altitude maneuvering (1000’
         AGL and below), wingmen and trailing elements will deconflict above the lead/lead
         element.
   3.10.2. Loss of Visual. Use the following procedures when one or more flight members lose
   visual contact within the formation or between elements:
         3.10.2.1. When any flight member calls "blind", they will initially maneuver away from
         the last known position of the other flight member/element (primarily by altering altitude)
         and await a response. The appropriate flight member will immediately respond with
         "visual" and a position report or "blind".
         3.10.2.2. If the other flight member is also "blind", then the flight lead will take action to
         ensure altitude separation between flight members and elements.
             3.10.2.2.1. The flight lead will specify either AGL or Mean Sea Level (MSL) when
             directing the formation to deconflict and use a minimum of 500 feet altitude
             separation.
             3.10.2.2.2. Avoid climbs or descents through the deconfliction altitude when
             possible.
         3.10.2.3. If visual contact is still not regained, the flight lead will take additional action
         to ensure flight path deconfliction within the flight to include a Terminate/Knock-It-Off
         (KIO) call if necessary. The flight lead should consider scenario restrictions such as
         sanctuary altitudes and adversary blocks when directing deconfliction.
         3.10.2.4. Aircraft will maintain altitude separation until visual and, if necessary, will
         navigate with altitude separation until mutual support is regained.
      3.10.3. Two-Ship. The following rules apply for flight path deconfliction during tactical
      maneuvering of two-ship formations:
         3.10.3.1. The wingman is normally responsible for flight path deconfliction.
         3.10.3.2. The flight lead becomes responsible for deconfliction when:
AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010                                           19


          3.10.3.2.1. Tactical maneuvering places the lead in the wingman's "blind cone" or
          forces the wingman's primary attention away from the lead (i.e. wingman becomes
          the engaged fighter).
          3.10.3.2.2. The wingman calls "padlocked" or ―
                                                       blind‖.
      3.10.3.3. Deconfliction responsibility transfers back to the wingman once the wingman
      positively acknowledges a visual on his lead (except in cases of tactical maneuvering
      where the flight lead is no longer in the wingman’s ―blind cone‖).
   3.10.4. Three/Four-Ship (or Greater). When flights of more than two aircraft are in
   tactical formation:
      3.10.4.1. Formation visual signals performed by a flight or element lead pertain only to
      the associated element unless specified otherwise by the flight lead.
      3.10.4.2. Trailing aircraft and elements will maintain sufficient spacing so that primary
      emphasis during formation maneuvering and turns is on low altitude awareness and
      deconfliction within elements, not on deconfliction between elements.
3.11. Chase Formation.
   3.11.1. Restrictions. Any pilot may fly safety chase for aircraft with a problem or under
   emergency conditions.
      3.11.1.1. Pilots who have successfully completed an Instrument and Qualification
      evaluation may chase as safety observer for aircraft performing simulated instrument
      flight or hung ordnance patterns.
      3.11.1.2. Specialized missions (i.e., Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E), Weapon
      Systems Evaluation Program (WSEP), live weapons delivery, etc.) and training
      conducted IAW AFI 11-2F-15EV1 may be chased by Combat Mission Ready
      (CMR)/Basic Mission Capable (BMC) pilots designated by group or squadron
      commanders.
      3.11.1.3. All other chase events may only be flown by an IP, Flight Examiner (FE), or
      upgrading IP (UIP) under the supervision of an IP.
   3.11.2. Procedures.
      3.11.2.1. A safety observer in a chase aircraft, except IP/FE/specialized mission chase,
      will maneuver in a 30-60 degree cone and maintain nose/tail separation to effectively
      clear and provide assistance.
      3.11.2.2. IP/FE/specialized mission aircraft will maneuver as necessary, but must
      maintain nose/tail separation.
      3.11.2.3. No chase aircraft will stack lower than the lead aircraft when below 1,000 feet
      AGL.
      3.11.2.4. For live ordnance missions, the chase pilot is responsible for maintaining own
      ship frag deconfliction.
 20                      AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010


3.12. Show Formation. Refer to AFI 11-209, Aerial Event Policy and Procedures and
applicable MAJCOM directives for specific rules and appropriate approval levels to participate
in static displays and aerial events.
3.13. Maneuvering Parameters.
   3.13.1. If flight through wingtip vortices or jetwash is unavoidable or inadvertently
   encountered, immediately unload the aircraft to approximately 1 G.
   3.13.2. Do not extend flaps during Air Combat Training (ACBT).
   3.13.3. Minimum Altitudes.
       3.13.3.1. Nose high, low speed recoveries and Aircraft Handling Characteristics (AHC)
       vertical maneuvers: 10,000 feet AGL.
       3.13.3.2. Aerobatics: 5,000 feet AGL.
   3.13.4. Authorized speeds. (CONUS) Below 10,000 MSL (outside SUA or MTRs) fly no
   faster than the maneuvering airspeeds as published in TO 1F-15E-1 (e.g. 300 KCAS unless in
   the radar pattern). In order to aid adherence to this guidance, flight leads and aircrew will
   comply with the following:
       3.13.4.1. (CONUS) Accomplish air-to-air (A/A) systems checks above 10,000 MSL to
       the maximum extent possible.
       3.13.4.2. (CONUS) Accomplish TF checks above 10,000 MSL to the maximum extent
       possible. If TF checks must be accomplished below 10,000 MSL (i.e. due to weather)
       aircrew will minimize the time at higher airspeeds.
       3.13.4.3. Aircrew flying outside the CONUS will follow gaining MAJCOM, theater, or
       host nation guidance on airspeeds (USAFE: Aircrew will operate at airspeeds consistent
       with TO 1F-15E-1, AFTTP 3-3.F-15E, and local guidance). If no gaining MAJCOM,
       theater or host nation guidance exists, use the guidance in this instruction to the
       maximum extent practical.
3.14. G-Awareness Exercise.
   3.14.1. G-awareness exercises will be accomplished IAW AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules
   and Procedures. The Heads Up Display (HUD) will be filmed during G-awareness exercises
   with hot mic in both cockpits.
   3.14.2. During maneuver execution use visual lookout and briefed formation contracts as
   primary means to ensure aircraft deconfliction. Use onboard systems (i.e. FDL) only as an
   aid to situational awareness.
   3.14.3. Do not use G-awareness turns for systems checks or other items that detract from the
   intended purpose.
   3.14.4. Flight leads will ensure the airspace intended for conducting the G-awareness
   exercise is free from potential traffic conflicts. Use Air Traffic Control (ATC) services to the
   maximum extent practical to aid in clearing the airspace. Conduct the G-awareness exercise
   in the following airspace with preference to the order as listed (USAFE: Consider SUA as
   anytime the aircraft is under Basic, Traffic, or Deconfliction Service):
AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010                                             21


       3.14.4.1. SUA (e.g. Restricted or Warning areas, ATC Assigned Airspace, [ATCAA],
       Military Operating Areas [MOA], or MAJCOM-approved large-scale exercise and
       special mission areas).
       3.14.4.2. Above 10,000 MSL outside of SUA.
       3.14.4.3. Inside the confines of MTRs and above 5,000 AGL.
       3.14.4.4. Below 10,000 MSL outside of SUA.
3.15. Radio Procedures.
   3.15.1. Any flight member may make a "Knock-It-Off" or "Terminate" call IAW AFI 11-
   214. A KIO applies to any phase of flight and any type of mission.
   3.15.2. Wingman acknowledgment of flight lead radio calls indicates the wingman
   understands or that the appropriate action is complete or in the process of being completed.
   3.15.3. In addition to the radio procedures outlined in AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217V1
   and V2, Instrument Flight Procedures, and FLIP publications, the following radio
   transmissions are required:
       3.15.3.1. All flight members will acknowledge understanding the initial ATC clearance.
       Acknowledge subsequent ATC instructions as directed by the flight lead.
       3.15.3.2. Gear Checks. Each pilot will report gear down IAW the following guidance,
       but in no case later than crossing the runway threshold:
          3.15.3.2.1. Base turn for overhead patterns.
          3.15.3.2.2. Prior to 3NM final for VFR straight-in.
          3.15.3.2.3. Final Approach Fix (FAF) or glide slope intercept for instrument
          approaches.
          3.15.3.2.4. A wingman or chase ship need not make this call during a formation or
          chased approach.
3.16. Air Refueling. Pilots undergoing initial or recurrency training in air refueling will not
refuel with a student boom operator (does not apply to KC-10). The receiver aircrew will ensure
no student-to-student AR occurs during initial or recurrency training.
3.17. Low Altitude Procedures.
   3.17.1. Formation. Line abreast formation is only authorized at or above 300 feet AGL.
   When flying below 300 feet AGL direct the wingman to a wedge formation position.
   3.17.2. Terrain and Obstacle Clearance.
       3.17.2.1. All obstacle avoidance planning will be based on MSA and RAA as defined in
       para 2.4.4.
       3.17.2.2. If unable to visually acquire or ensure lateral separation from known obstacles
       that could be a factor to the flight, flight leads will direct a climb not later than 3 NM
       prior to ensure sufficient vertical separation IAW with AFI 11-202V3 paragraph 5.10.
       Do not descend back into the low level environment until visual with the obstacle or
       positional awareness dictates it is safe to do so.

   while outside of TF system limits. Sole attention will be placed on re-establishing aircraft
   parameters within TF limits.
   3.18.9. Any intentional maneuvering that will put the aircraft outside of TF limits will be at
   or above the MSA (or RAA if not within 5NM of course) or within the restrictions of para
   3.34 NVG Procedures.
 24                       AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010


   3.18.10. Abnormal Operation during IMC TF. Aircrews who experience failure of any
   portion of the TF system or A/A / A/G radar while flying IMC TF will immediately climb to
   (or above) the MSA (or RAA if not within 5NM of course).
       3.18.10.1. If the failure(s) can be cleared and safe TF regained, TF operations may
       resume.
       3.18.10.2. If the aircraft position cannot be accurately determined, aircrews will
       terminate the low level portion of the mission and execute route abort procedures IAW
       para 3.17.7.
3.19. Fuel Requirements.
   3.19.1. Joker Fuel. A pre-briefed fuel needed to terminate an event and proceed with the
   remainder of the mission.

   3.20.1. Overhead patterns may be flown with unexpended A/G practice ordnance (to include
   inert heavyweight), live air-to-air missiles, and any 20mm ammunition. Overhead patterns
   may be performed at deployed locations with unexpended live ordnance if required by local
   force protection arrival procedures.
   3.20.2. Initiate the break in the first 3,000 feet of the runway or as local procedures direct.
   3.20.3. Execute individual breaks in a level 180 degree turn to the downwind leg at
   minimum intervals of 5 seconds (except IP/FE chase or when in tactical formation).
   3.20.4. Aircraft must be wings level on final at approximately 300 feet AGL and 1 mile from
   the planned touchdown point.
3.21. Tactical Overhead Traffic Patterns. Tactical entry to the overhead traffic pattern is
permitted when:
   3.21.1. Specific local procedures are developed and coordination has been accomplished
   with appropriate ATC agencies.
   3.21.2. No more than four aircraft are in the flight.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010                                             25


   3.21.3. No aircraft are offset from the runway in the direction of the break. The intent is to
   avoid requiring a tighter than normal turn to arrive on normal downwind.
   3.21.4. Normal downwind and base turn positions as well as formation spacing are flown.
3.22. Low Approaches.
   3.22.1. Minimum Altitudes.

   pattern altitude until crossing the departure end of the runway unless local procedures,
   missed approach/climb-out procedures, or ATC instructions dictate otherwise.
3.23. Landing.
   3.23.1. The desired touchdown point is 500-1000 feet past the runway threshold for a VFR
   pattern or 500-1000 feet past the Runway Point of Intercept (RPI) for a precision approach.
   3.23.2. Minimum pattern and touchdown spacing is IAW AFI 11-202V3 as supplemented by
   MAJCOM. F-15A-D and foreign variants are similar fighter type aircraft to the F-15E.
   Increase spacing whenever wake turbulence is anticipated.
   3.23.3. Normally, all aircraft will land in the center of the runway and clear to the cold
   (turnoff) side of the runway when speed and conditions permit.
   3.23.4. Landing Restrictions.
      3.23.4.1. When the computed landing roll exceeds 80 percent of the available runway,
      land at an alternate if possible.
      3.23.4.2. Do not land over any raised web barrier (e.g. MA-1A, 61QS11), or loose or
      slack cable (e.g. BAK-12/13/14)
      3.23.4.3. During the aerobrake portion of a normal, dry runway landing, leave flaps
      down to provide increased aerodynamic drag and normal nose fall.
      3.23.4.4. When the RCR at the base of intended landing is less than 12, land at an
      alternate if possible. If an alternate is not available, an approach end or mid-field
      arrestment is recommended.
3.24. Touch-and-Go Landings. Fly touch-and-go landings IAW AFI 11-202V3, as
supplemented by MAJCOM. Do not fly touch-and-go landings with any of the following:
   3.24.1. Live A/A or A/G ordnance (EXCEPTION: any 20mm ammunition).
 26                       AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010

   3.24.3. Fuel remaining in any external tank.
3.25. Closed Traffic Patterns.
   3.25.1. Initiate the pattern at the departure end of the runway unless directed otherwise by
   local procedures or ATC.
   3.25.2. If executing a formation low approach, a sequential closed may be flown with ATC
   concurrence.
   3.25.3. Plan to arrive on downwind at 200-250 KCAS.
3.26. Back Seat Approaches and Landings. During back seat approaches and landings, the
front seat pilot will visually clear the area, monitor aircraft parameters and configurations, and be
prepared to direct a go-around or take control of the aircraft (as briefed by the rear cockpit pilot)
if necessary.
3.27. Formation Approaches and Landings.
   3.27.1. Normally accomplish formation landings from a precision approach. If not,
   accomplish the landing from any applicable published approach or a VFR straight-in using
   available approach path guidance (VASI, PAPI, PLASI, etc.). In all cases, use a rate of
   descent similar to a normal precision approach.
   3.27.2. CT formation landings must be led by a qualified flight lead unless an IP is in the
   element.
   3.27.3. Do not practice formation approaches with a combined fuel and stores weight greater
   than 10,000 pounds (N/A for FE Chase).
   3.27.4. Aircraft must be within 3,000 pounds weight of each other and symmetrically loaded
   as defined in para 3.7.3.
   3.27.5. Formation landings are prohibited when:
       3.27.5.1. The crosswind component exceeds 10 knots.
       3.27.5.2. The RSC (or primary braking portion of the runway for dual surface runways)
       is reported as wet; or slush, ice or snow is on the runway.
       3.27.5.3. The runway width is less than 125 feet.

       Pilot Weather Category (PWC) in the flight, whichever is higher (except in an actual
       emergency requiring a formation landing).
3.28. After Shutdown Procedures. All flight members will accomplish a post flight walk-
around. The intent of this inspection is to find evidence of birdstrike, lost panels, damaged
ordnance, structural damage resulting from over-Gs, or other in-flight abnormalities.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010                                                 27


Section 3E—Night Procedures

   should be OFF and the position lights ON and not flashing.
   3.29.2. Taxi with a minimum of 300 feet spacing.
   3.29.3. Use the taxi light while taxiing unless it might interfere with an aircraft landing or
   taking off. The taxiing aircraft will come to a stop if the area cannot be visually cleared
   without the taxi light.
   3.29.4. Minimum required operational exterior lighting for night flying operations is:
   landing and taxi light, both wing-root anti-collision lights, both wingtip position lights, and at
   least one of the vertical stab lights, either the Left Vertical Stab (LVS) position light or the
   Right Vertical Stab (RVS) anti-collision light. Substituting a formation light in lieu of a
   wingtip position light is not permitted.
3.30. Night Takeoff.
   3.30.1. During a night formation takeoff, direct brake release and configuration changes on
   the radio.
   3.30.2. Following takeoff, each aircraft and element will climb on runway heading to 1,000
   feet AGL before initiating turns, except where departure instructions specifically preclude
   compliance.
3.31. Night Join-Up.
   3.31.1. Weather criteria for night join-up underneath a ceiling is minimum 3,000 feet ceiling
   and 5 miles (8 KM) visibility.
   3.31.2. After join-up, turn the anti-collision lights OFF, but keep position lights ON except
   for the last aircraft in formation. The last aircraft will keep the anti-collision lights ON
   unless otherwise directed by the flight lead.
3.32. Night Formation Procedures.
   3.32.1. When in trail formation maintain aircraft spacing primarily by instruments, radar,
   Air-to-Air Interrogator (AAI), and timing. If aircraft spacing cannot be ensured, then
   establish altitude separation (1,000 feet minimum). Cross-check instruments at all times to
   ensure ground clearance.
   3.32.2. Do not change lead or wing formation positions below 1,500 feet AGL unless on
   RADAR downwind. Direct lead and position changes using the radio and from a stabilized,
   wings-level attitude.
   3.32.3. Prior to a formation break-up at night, the flight lead will transmit attitude, altitude,
   airspeed, and altimeter setting, which will be confirmed and acknowledged with ―            good
   NAVAIDs‖ by the flight.
   3.32.4. Battle damage checks will not be performed at night without NVGs (see para 3.34.6)

 28                        AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010


   3.33.1. A fully functioning TF system is required to conduct night TF operations (VMC or
   IMC).     In addition to the minimum equipment listed in para 3.18.5, a usable
   Navigation/Forward Looking Infrared (NAV/FLIR) HUD image is required. NVGs may be
   used in place of the NAV/FLIR.
   3.33.2. TF failure prior to low altitude entry: If the TF system fails prior to route entry,
   aircrew may still enter the route and continue the mission either at the MSA (or RAA if
   greater than 5NM from course) or by using NVG Procedures from para 3.34.
   3.33.3. TF failure while low altitude: Aircrews who experience failure of any portion of the
   TF system or NAV/FLIR imagery (or NVGs if used in place of the NAV/FLIR) while flying
   night TF low level will immediately climb to (or above) the MSA (or RAA if not within
   5NM of course) or transition to NVG procedures.
   3.33.4. Climb to MSA (or RAA if not within 5NM of course) when NAV/FLIR
   transmissivity or NVG visibility (if NVG is used in place of the NAV/FLIR) is insufficient
   for use as an aid for terrain avoidance (N/A for IMC TF qualified crews and supervised
   crews in an IMC TF upgrade using IMC procedures).
3.34. NVG Procedures.
   3.34.1. NVGs must be preflight tested and adjusted by the individual in the unit eyelane
   prior to NVG operations.

         3.34.2.3. Remove NVGs prior to initial or the FAF or glide slope intercept.
         3.34.2.4. Flight members will communicate when donning or doffing NVGs. Only one
         crewmember per aircraft will don or doff NVGs at a time.
      3.34.3. NVGs will not be worn in IMC.
   3.34.4. Wingmen will fly no closer than NVG close formation (as defined in AFTTP 3-3.F-
   15E Chap 8).
   3.34.5. NVGs may be worn for tanker rejoins, but will be raised to the up and locked
   position or removed and stowed no later than the pre-contact position.
   3.34.6. Night BD Checks.
         3.34.6.1. Night BD checks are permitted only when wearing NVGs.
         3.34.6.2. The crew performing the BD check will approach with position lights bright
         and steady and beacons on while the aircraft being checked sets external lights to a
         minimum (with at least anti-collision beacons off).
      3.34.7. NVG Abnormal Procedures.
         3.34.7.1. During in-flight emergencies, immediately assess whether the NVGs aid or
         hinder completion of emergency procedures. If they are a hindrance or the emergency
         may deteriorate into an ejection situation, remove and stow the NVGs.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010                                                29


       3.34.7.2. For NVG failure or inadvertent flight into weather while in formation or close

   3.35.1. Normally land from an instrument straight-in approach. Refer to AFI 11-202V3,
   Chap 5, as supplemented, for specific procedures.
   3.35.2. Only perform night formation landings when required for safe recovery of the
   aircraft.

Section 3F—Miscellaneous Procedures

3.36. Change of Aircraft Control. Both aircrew members must know at all times who has
control of the aircraft. Use the statement "you have the aircraft" to transfer aircraft control. The
aircrew member receiving control of the aircraft will acknowledge "I have the aircraft" and
lightly shake the stick. Once assuming control of the aircraft, maintain control until
relinquishing it as stated above. EXCEPTION: If the intercom fails the pilot in the front
cockpit, if not already in control of the aircraft, will shake the stick and assume control of the
aircraft and radios unless otherwise prebriefed.
3.37. Ops Checks.
   3.37.1. Accomplish sufficient ops checks to ensure safe mission accomplishment. Each
   aircrew should monitor the fuel system carefully throughout the flight to identify low or
   trapped fuel or imbalance situations as soon as possible. Ops checks are required:
       3.37.1.1. During climb or at level-off after takeoff.
       3.37.1.2. Prior to each ACBT engagement or intercept. In addition, a check for proper
       operation of all transfer tanks (wing tanks balanced and tank 1 feeding) will be performed
       prior to and between engagements or planned maneuvering above 30 units Angle of
       Attack (AOA).
       3.37.1.3. Prior to entering an A/G range, at least once while on the range if multiple
       passes are made, and at least once after departing the range.
       3.37.1.4. Following Air Refueling.
 30                        AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010


   3.37.2. Minimum Ops Check items are engine instruments, total and internal fuel quantities
   and balance, G-suit connection, oxygen system, cabin altitude, and Overload Warning
   System (OWS).
   3.37.3. In formation flights, the flight lead may initiate ops checks by radio call or visual
   signal and wingmen will respond appropriately. The query and response for ops checks will
   include the following:
         3.37.3.1. Pointer over counter readings (e.g. "13 over 25, externals" or "13 over 18,
         CFTs").
         3.37.3.2. Following external wing tank and CFT fuel consumption, ensure tank one is
         feeding correctly; add a "balanced" call to the normal Ops Check reply when wing tank
         fuel balance checks are required and the difference is no greater than 200 lbs. (e.g. "8
         squared, balanced, tank 1") (EXCEPTION: Total fuel only may periodically be used
         during high demand phases of flight).
   3.37.4. Fighter Data Link (FDL) fuel status will not be used as the primary source of fuel
   checks.
3.38. F-15E Crew Duties. Both crewmembers are responsible for successful sortie completion.
They will perform a crew brief before each flight to ensure an understanding of all aspects of the
mission. Aircrew will reference AFTTPs 3-3.F15E and 3-1.F-15E for a thorough discussion of
F-15E crew coordination. Unless briefed otherwise, the following duties apply. (EXCEPTION:
The restrictions listed in para 3.38.2 may not be altered.)
   3.38.1. General. Brief radar and visual lookout responsibilities, crew coordination, and
   specific duties for each phase of flight.
      3.38.2. Weapon Systems Officer (WSO) Flying. WSOs will not fly during:
         3.38.2.1. Takeoff or landing.

         lower than non-precision approach minimums, the pilot's weather category, or 500' AGL,
         whichever is higher).
         3.38.2.7. Overhead patterns
   3.38.3. Takeoff. The WSO will check the Min go/Max abort speed when required, monitor
   engine and flight instruments, check gear and flaps up prior to their TO speed limits, and
   advise the pilot of any discrepancies.
   3.38.4. Climb/Departure. The aircrew member flying the aircraft will call altimeter setting
   to 29.92 when passing the transition altitude.
   3.38.5. Cruise, Navigation, and Instrument Flight. The WSO will relay aircraft attitude,
   altitude, and airspeed information to the pilot when departing a formation at night or in IMC.

   3.38.6. Air Refueling.
      3.38.6.1. Pilot Responsibilities. Be prepared to immediately use the air refueling
      release HOTAS if an IP/UIP in the RCP is accomplishing the refueling and either the
      RCP air refueling release button on the stick doesn’t work or safety dictates.
      3.38.6.2. WSO Responsibilities. Advise the pilot of boom position and call when boom
      is positively disconnected and clear.
   3.38.7. Instrument Penetrations and Descents.
      3.38.7.1. The aircrew member in control of the aircraft will advise the other crewmember
      of intentions when performing any penetration or approach.
      3.38.7.2. Both crewmembers must confirm the Decision Height (DH) or Minimum
      Descent Altitude (MDA) for an approach, or the RAA and MSA altitudes for descents
      into the low altitude environment.
      3.38.7.3. Both crewmembers will refer to appropriate FLIP publications during the
      holding, penetration and approach.
      3.38.7.4. The crewmember not in control of the aircraft will verbally check altimeter
      settings when passing the transition level.
      3.38.7.5. The crewmember not in control of the aircraft will advise the other
      crewmember when 1,000 feet above any intermediate level off altitude, 100 feet above
      DH or MDA for the approach being flown, or when 1000 feet above the minimum
      altitude during descents into the low altitude environment.
   3.38.8. Pattern and Landing. The crewmember not in control of the aircraft will:
      3.38.8.1. Monitor the pattern with emphasis on engine power, altitude, airspeed, landing
      gear, and flap position.
      3.38.8.2. Visually clear the area.
      3.38.8.3. Monitor ground speed versus runway remaining during the landing roll to
      assess aerobraking effectiveness and available stopping distance.
   3.38.9. After Landing. If an IP/UIP accomplished the landing from the RCP, the pilot in
   the FCP will assume control of the aircraft as briefed by the pilot in the RCP to perform the
   taxiing.
3.39. Identification Friend or Foe/Selective Identification Feature (IFF/SIF). Excessive
Mode 3/A and Mode 4 interrogations can cause ATC to momentarily drop surveillance tracks.
Aircrew may continue to interrogate Mode 3/A and 4 as operational, training, and safety
requirements dictate, but will minimize use in Range While Search (RWS) when pointed at
known high-density traffic areas. Interrogations in the more focused radar modes (e.g. STT,
TWS) have less impact upon ATC operations.

                                            Chapter 4

                               INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES

4.1. General.
   4.1.1. In IMC the Electronic Attitude Director Indicator (EADI) must be used as the primary
   attitude reference by the crewmember flying the aircraft. The F-15E HUD is not certified as
   a Primary Flight Reference (PFR) IAW AFI 11-217V1; therefore, it cannot be used as a sole
   attitude reference.
   4.1.2. The HUD is the primary reference for low level and TF operations.
   4.1.3. Do not use the HUD to recover from an unusual attitude or when executing lost
   wingman procedures except when no other attitude reference is available.
   4.1.4. The F-15E INS and EGI are approved for Enroute Area Navigation (RNAV);
   however, RNAV and GPS approaches are not authorized.
4.2. Takeoff and Join-Up.
   4.2.1. The flight lead must get an appropriate ATC clearance (altitude block or trail
   formation) when a flight join-up is not possible due to weather or operational requirements.
   4.2.2. Formation trail departures must comply with instructions for a nonstandard formation
   flight as defined in FLIP.
   4.2.3. If weather is below 1500 feet ceiling and 3 miles (5 KM) visibility, each aircraft and
   element will climb on takeoff heading to 1,000 feet AGL before initiating any turns, except
   when departure instructions specifically preclude compliance.
4.3. Trail Procedures.
   4.3.1. General.
      4.3.1.1. The flight lead must brief the flight on spacing, configuration and airspeeds in all
      phases of flight that trail formations will be flown.
      4.3.1.2. Flight leads will request non-standard formation from ATC.
      4.3.1.3. ATC instructions to the lead aircraft will be for the entire flight.
      4.3.1.4. Limit all turns to a maximum of 30 degrees of bank.
   4.3.2. Trail Departure.
      4.3.2.1. Reference AFTTP 3-1.F-15E, para 3.6, for Trail Departure techniques.
      4.3.2.2. During trail formations basic instrument flying is the first priority. Strictly
      adhere to the briefed airspeeds, power settings, altitudes, headings, and turn points. If
      task saturation occurs, cease attempts to maintain trail, concentrate on flying the
      instrument departure, and then notify the flight lead. The flight lead will then notify
      ATC.
      4.3.2.3. Each aircraft or element will follow the No Radar Contact procedures until the
      aircraft or element immediately in trail has radar contact and called "tied."
AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010                                               33


     4.3.2.4. Use a minimum of 20 seconds takeoff spacing.
  4.3.3. No Radar Contact.
     4.3.3.1. The flight lead will call initiating all turns. Subsequent aircraft must delay turns
     to maintain the desired spacing .
     4.3.3.2. Each aircraft and element will maintain 20 seconds or 2-3 mile spacing using all
     available aircraft systems and NAVAIDs to monitor position.
     4.3.3.3. During climbs and descents, each aircraft or element will call passing each 5,000
     foot altitude increment with altitude and heading (or heading passing) until join-up, level-
     off, or the following aircraft or element calls "tied."
     4.3.3.4. Each aircraft and element will call initiating any altitude or heading changes.
     Acknowledgments are not required; however, it is imperative that preceding aircraft or
     elements monitor the radio transmissions and progress of the succeeding aircraft and
     elements, and immediately correct deviations from the planned route.
     4.3.3.5. Each aircraft and element will maintain at least 1,000 feet vertical separation
     from the preceding aircraft or element until establishing radar or visual contact except in
     instances where departure instructions specifically preclude compliance. Reduce vertical
     separation to 500 feet if necessary to comply with MSA restrictions.
     4.3.3.6. In the event a visual join-up cannot be accomplished on top or at level-off, the
     flight lead will request altitude separation for each succeeding aircraft or element to meet
     the requirements of the above paragraph.
  4.3.4. Radar Contact.
     4.3.4.1. Each aircraft and element will call "tied" when radar contact is established with
     the preceding aircraft.
     4.3.4.2. Once all aircraft are tied, no further radio calls are required unless radar contact
     is lost.
     4.3.4.3. In flights of three or more aircraft, use all available aircraft systems (i.e. radar,
     TACAN, AAI, FDL, etc.) to ensure that trail is maintained on the correct aircraft.
  4.3.5. En route Trail. Flight leads must brief airspeeds, power settings, and configurations.
  4.3.6. Trail Recovery.
     4.3.6.1. Trail recoveries are only authorized at home station and designated deployed
     locations. Appropriate ATC agencies must approve and local operating procedures must
     address trail recovery procedures. As a minimum, procedures must address each
     recovery profile, missed approach, climb-out, desired and maximum spacing
     requirements, lost contact, and lost communications.
     4.3.6.2. Limit trail recovery to a maximum of four aircraft.
     4.3.6.3. Trail recoveries are authorized when weather at the base of intended landing is at
     or above the highest PWC in the flight or approach minimums, whichever is higher.
     4.3.6.4. Prior to taking spacing the flight lead must do the following:
         4.3.6.4.1. Coordinate the trail recovery with ATC prior to taking spacing.
 34                       AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010


          4.3.6.4.2. Ensure that all wingmen have ‖good NAVAIDS‖ and an A/A radar.
          4.3.6.4.3. Accomplish the spacing maneuver in VMC to the max extent possible.
      4.3.6.5. Once established on a segment of a published approach, each aircraft must
      comply with all published altitudes and restrictions while maintaining in-trail separation.
      4.3.6.6. Unless local procedures establish defined reference points for airspeed and
      configuration changes, the flight lead must direct changes by radio. At flight lead's call
      all aircraft must simultaneously comply with the directed change.
      4.3.6.7. All aircraft must report the FAF or glide slope intercept.
      4.3.6.8. Lost Contact. If contact is lost with the preceding aircraft, the following will be
      accomplished:
          4.3.6.8.1. The pilot will transmit, "Callsign (C/S), lost contact."
          4.3.6.8.2. The preceding aircraft will respond with altitude, airspeed, and heading.
          4.3.6.8.3. If contact is lost while established on a segment of a published approach,
          flight members may continue the approach, but must confirm separation via
          navigation aids.
          4.3.6.8.4. If separation cannot be confirmed, execute missed approach or climb-out
          as instructed by ATC.
4.4. Formation Split-Up.
   4.4.1. Accomplish formation split-ups in VMC to the max extent possible.
   4.4.2. If IMC, accomplish the split-up in straight and level flight.
   4.4.3. Prior to a split-up in IMC, the flight lead must transmit attitude, airspeed, altitude, and
   altimeter setting which will be acknowledged by wingmen. Wingmen must confirm good
   NAVAIDS.
4.5. Formation Penetration.
   4.5.1. Restrict formation penetrations to two aircraft when the weather at the base of
   intended landing is less than overhead traffic pattern minimums.
   4.5.2. If a formation landing is intended, position the wingman on the appropriate wing prior
   to weather penetration.
4.6. IMC Lead Change. During IMC formation flights, do not change leads below 1,500 feet
AGL unless on RADAR downwind.
4.7. Approach Procedures.
   4.7.1. Aircrew will not fly any published instrument approach procedure (e.g. DoD,
   Jeppesen, ICAO) that requires airspeeds less than those specified in the TO.
   4.7.2. The F-15E is Approach Category E. Use Approach Category D minimums at an
   emergency or divert airfield where no Category E minimums are published, provided:
      4.7.2.1. A straight-in approach is flown.
      4.7.2.2. For the final approach segment, the aircraft is flown at 165 KCAS or less.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010                                           35


     4.7.2.3. For the missed approach segment, the aircraft is flown at 255 knots true airspeed
     (KTAS) or less. In those cases where a high density altitude may cause 255 KTAS to
     equal a KCAS below the speeds specified in TO 1F-15E-1, Cat D approaches shall not be
     flown.

   during a practice gun attack against airborne targets.
   5.2.2. Always confirm the status of the gun system prior to flight IAW TO 1F-15E-34-1-1-
   CL-1.
   5.2.3. Simulated A/A gun employment may be performed with a loaded gun provided the
   gun is safed and a trigger check is accomplished. Point the aircraft away from other aircraft
   and inhabited areas during any trigger check.
   5.2.4. Never perform simulated A/A gun employment with a hot gun (one that is not safed
   IAW TO 1F-15E-34-1-1-CL-1). Never perform a trigger check with a hot gun, regardless of
   Master Arm switch position.
5.3. Maneuvering Limitations.
   5.3.1. Minimum airspeed during LOWAT maneuvering is 350 KCAS.
   5.3.2. When configured with three external tanks, aircraft will operate under the LIMITED
   maneuvering category.
   5.3.3. When configured with external wing tanks only (e.g. no centerline fuel tank),
   UNLIMITED maneuvering is allowed once the externals are empty (flight manual
   restrictions still apply).
   5.3.4. Negative-G guns jinks are prohibited.
   5.3.5. When acting as a restricted maneuvering target for low altitude intercepts, the
   minimum airspeed is 300 KCAS.
   5.3.6. A/A tactical maneuvering (ACBT and unlimited or limited maneuvering intercepts) is
   prohibited when wing fuel imbalance results in a 30 unit restriction IAW TO 1F-15E-1 Ch 5
   and Ch 6. When the imbalance is corrected to within TO limits, the briefed mission can be
   continued.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010                                                37

                     AIR-TO-SURFACE WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT

6.1. References. AFI 11-214 contains A/G procedures and restrictions applicable to all aircraft.
This chapter contains procedures and restrictions specific to F-15E operations.
6.2. Simulated Attacks against Off-Range or Manned Targets. May be conducted, to
include use of Master Arm and A/G Master Mode, when carrying practice ordnance under the
following restrictions:
   6.2.1. No live or carted heavyweight inert A/G ordnance, or live A/A missiles are loaded.
   6.2.2. The A/G training mode is used on the Programmable Armament Control Set (PACS).
   6.2.3. Stations loaded with carted practice ordnance are not selected on the training PACS.
   6.2.4. The combat laser may be used only in approved areas.
   6.2.5. Simulated Strafe.
       6.2.5.1. Simulated strafe is defined as the combined use of Master Arm and trigger
       actuation during a practice gun attack against ground targets.
       6.2.5.2. Simulated strafe is permitted with a safed gun, loaded or unloaded, provided a
       trigger check is previously accomplished.
       6.2.5.3. Do not perform simulated strafe (as defined in para 6.2.5.1) with a hot gun
       (loaded or empty).
6.3. Pop-Up Attacks. Abort pop-up attacks if airspeed decreases below 350 KCAS (300 KCAS
above 10,000 feet AGL).
6.4. TF System Delivery Procedures.
   6.4.1. Maximum angle of bank during night recovery maneuvers (from loft or climbing safe
   escape) is 135 degrees.
   6.4.2. When performing weapons deliveries on a range using only TF procedures (e.g.
   NVGs are not used) all maneuvering in the bombing pattern below MSA will be inside TF
   limits.
   6.4.3. TF Loft Deliveries.
       6.4.3.1. TF loft deliveries are instrument maneuvers that exceed numerous TF limits.
       Aircrew will reference AFTTP 3-3.F-15E Chapter 8 for a comprehensive list of delivery
       and recovery procedures and considerations.
       6.4.3.2. The TF loft escape corridor is defined as a 10NM wide corridor centered on
       planned flight path, starting at the planned roll out point and extending for 8NM along the
       egress heading. Aircrew will calculate and annotate both an RIA and MSA for every
       planned escape corridor.
       6.4.3.3. Prior to TF loft deliveries both aircrew will verify accuracy of their standby ADI
       against an EADI and verbalize inter-cockpit ―   ADI up‖.
 38                      AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010


      6.4.3.4. If the TF system fails during recovery, maintain the appropriate minimum
      altitude (RAA, MSA, or NVG minimum) until the TF system recovers.
      6.4.3.5. If at any time during the TF loft delivery or recovery airspeed drops below 300
      KCAS, abort the maneuver and recover to level flight. Direct primary emphasis towards
      aircraft attitude, altitude, and regaining airspeed.
6.5. Night and IMC Surface Attack Range Procedures.
   6.5.1. For night range weapons deliveries, the weather must allow the Range Control Officer
   (RCO) (for a class A range), or a flight member or range personnel (for a class B or C range)
   to clear the target area and spot or score the ordnance impact.
   6.5.2. Multiple weapons deliveries may be accomplished at night and/or during IMC if range
   patterns and procedures that ensure positive aircraft separation are established and briefed.
      6.5.2.1. TF altitude and maneuvering restrictions apply throughout the pattern for TF
      deliveries. If the downwind is flown at MSA or above do not begin a TF descent to the
      planned delivery altitude until in a position to remain within TF limits.
      6.5.2.2. Minimum pattern altitude for non-TF deliveries is MSA or above, range
      restrictions permitting, unless complying with para 3.34 (NVG Procedures).
   6.5.3. For IMC range deliveries through or above the weather comply with the applicable
   Range Orders and the following restrictions:
      6.5.3.1. A fully functional Present Position Keeping Source (PPKS) must be selected for
      delivery. Use of EGI PPKS requires a GPS accuracy of 50' or better and a star to indicate
      blended solution.
      6.5.3.2. Ballistic Ordnance.
          6.5.3.2.1. Use of MN or INS PPKS requires a system altitude update within five
          minutes prior to release.
          6.5.3.2.2. A target direct and minimum of one target offset High Resolution Map
          (HRM) patch maps (1.3 NM or better) are required for radar target designation.
          6.5.3.2.3. Nav target designation will only be used with EGI PPKS. Verify target
          coordinates against published range coordinates to ensure on-range impact.
      6.5.3.3. Inertially Aided Munitions (IAM).
          6.5.3.3.1. Verify Smart Weapons Page target coordinates against published range
          coordinates.
          6.5.3.3.2. Verify weapon navigation solution quality is at least MARGINAL 1 or
          better and no warning messages or weapon DGRD or FAIL cues are on the Smart
          Weapons Page.
          6.5.3.3.3. Release in the IN-ZONE LAR or at the planned DGR if no LAR exists.

                        ABNORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

7.1. General. These procedures do not supersede TO guidance.
   7.1.1. Do not accept an aircraft for flight with a malfunction addressed in the Emergency
   Procedures and Abnormal Operations section of the TO until it has been corrected.
   7.1.2. Do not use a malfunctioning system unless it is required for safe recovery of the
   aircraft.
   7.1.3. Do not continue in-flight troubleshooting of a malfunction after completing TO
   emergency procedures and the aircraft may be safely recovered.
   7.1.4. Fuel Dumping.
      7.1.4.1. Only conduct fuel dumping to reduce aircraft gross weight for safety of flight.
      7.1.4.2. When circumstances permit, dump above 10,000 feet AGL over unpopulated
      areas.
      7.1.4.3. Ensure the dump switch is returned to normal before landing.
      7.1.4.4. After landing, make an appropriate entry in the AFTO Forms 781.
   7.1.5. Do not taxi aircraft with malfunctions that effect the nosewheel steering or brake
   system.
   7.1.6. Flight Control Malfunctions.
      7.1.6.1. For actual or perceived flight control malfunctions, terminate maneuvering and
      take appropriate action.
      7.1.6.2. If the flight control problem was due to crew member or passenger stick or
      rudder interference, the pilot will take appropriate action to ensure no further flight
      control interference occurs.
7.2. Ground Aborts.
   7.2.1. Delayed aircraft may join the flight at a briefed rendezvous point or may fly a briefed
   alternate single ship mission.
   7.2.2. If accomplishing a join-up to spread, route, or fingertip, cease tactical maneuvering
   until the delayed aircraft is joined and all flight members are ready to continue.
   7.2.3. Delayed flight members may join a fight in progress if pre-briefed by the flight lead.
7.3. Takeoff Aborts.
   7.3.1. If aborting the takeoff, clear to the appropriate side of the runway as expeditiously as
   possible based on position within the element. If this is not feasible because of possible cable
   engagement, clear straight ahead.
   7.3.2. As soon as practical, give call sign and state intentions on appropriate frequency or
   frequencies. A "Cable, Cable, Cable" radio call indicates intent for a departure-end
   arrestment.
 40                          AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010


   7.3.3. Lower the tailhook if there is any doubt about the ability to stop on the runway.
   7.3.4. When applying the brakes above 120 KCAS during a takeoff abort or hot brakes are
   suspected declare a ground emergency, taxi the aircraft to the designated hot brake area and
   follow hot brake procedures. See TO 1F-15E-1 Section 3 for list of brake overheat
   considerations.
   7.3.5. Subsequent aircraft will hold position, abort, or takeoff as appropriate to maintain
   adequate clearance.
7.4. Air Aborts.
      7.4.1. If an abort occurs after takeoff, all aircraft will maintain their original ATC call sign.
   7.4.2. Chase emergency air aborts to the field of intended landing. The flight lead will
   determine if a chase is required for non-emergency aborts.
   7.4.3. Abort the mission and land out of a straight-in approach, regardless of apparent
   damage or subsequent normal operation, for any of the following:
         7.4.3.1. Birdstrike or Foreign Object Damage (FOD).
         7.4.3.2. Flight control system anomalies (not including flight control system lights that
         reset IAW TO procedures).
         7.4.3.3. Engine flameout, stagnation, or shutdown.
   7.4.4. If an aircraft experiences an over-G, use the following procedures:
         7.4.4.1. Immediately terminate maneuvering and call up the OWS matrix to analyze the
         displayed parameters.
         7.4.4.2. If level "1" (one) is displayed in any column of the matrix except Mass Items
         (MIT), perform a BD check with emphasis on the overall condition of the aircraft. If no
         abnormalities are noted, the flight lead may continue the briefed mission. If a subsequent
         level "1" or greater over-G occurs, terminate the mission, perform a BD check, RTB, and
         fly a straight-in approach.
         7.4.4.3. If level "1" (one) is displayed in the MIT column, or level "2" (two) or greater is
         displayed in any column of the matrix, terminate the mission, perform a BD check, RTB,
         and fly a straight-in approach.
         7.4.4.4. After landing, document all over-Gs in the AFTO Form 781.
7.5. Radio Failure.
   7.5.1. General. In addition to this volume, individual aircraft experiencing radio failure will
   comply with procedures outlined in FLIP, AFI 11-202V3, Host Nation, and local directives.
   Aircraft experiencing any difficulty or emergency in addition to NORDO will proceed as
   required by the situation.
      7.5.2. Formation.
         7.5.2.1. Close or Route.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010                                           41


        7.5.2.1.1. Flight members who experience total radio failure while in close or route
        formation will maneuver within formation parameters to attract the attention of
        another flight member and give the appropriate visual signals.
        7.5.2.1.2. Terminate the mission as soon as practical and lead the NORDO aircraft to
        the base of intended landing or a divert base.
        7.5.2.1.3. Perform a formation approach to a drop-off on final unless safety
        considerations dictate otherwise.
     7.5.2.2. Other Than Close or Route.
        7.5.2.2.1. If flying other than close or route formation when radio failure occurs, the
        NORDO aircraft should attempt to rejoin to a route position at approximately 500 feet
        on another flight member.
        7.5.2.2.2. The NORDO aircraft is responsible for maintaining clearances from other
        flight members until his presence is acknowledged by a wing rock, signifying
        clearance to join.
        7.5.2.2.3. Once joined, the NORDO aircraft will give the appropriate visual signals.
        7.5.2.2.4. If pre-briefed, the NORDO aircraft may proceed to a rendezvous point and
        hold.
        7.5.2.2.5. NORDO aircraft will proceed to the base of intended landing or a divert
        base upon reaching the minimum fuel required for a NORDO recovery (not below
        BINGO) regardless of rejoin status.
  7.5.3. Surface Attack NORDO Procedures.
     7.5.3.1. Aircrew will reference AFTTP 3-3.F-15E, Chapter 5, for a comprehensive list of
     Surface Attack NORDO procedures for safe flight management.
     7.5.3.2. Jettison of Unexpended Ordnance. If radio failure occurs and circumstances
     preclude landing with unexpended ordnance, accomplish a safe jettison of the ordnance
     provided the following conditions are met:
        7.5.3.2.1. The NORDO aircraft joins on another flight member that has radio contact
        with the remainder of the flight and the RCO (on a manned range).
        7.5.3.2.2. Stores jettison visual signals specified in AFI 11-205 (hold fist at top of
        canopy and make several pumping motions) are relayed to the NORDO aircraft to
        initiate jettison.
  7.5.4. NORDO Recovery.
     7.5.4.1. Go-around.
        7.5.4.1.1. The chase aircraft will go-around, pass the NORDO aircraft, and rock his
        wings.
        7.5.4.1.2. The NORDO aircraft will go-around if in a safe position to do so.
        7.5.4.1.3. If the NORDO aircraft is in formation as a wingman, the lead will initiate a
        gentle turn into the wingman and begin the go-around.
 42                      AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010


       7.5.4.2. Approach End Arrestment.
          7.5.4.2.1. The NORDO aircraft will signal intent for an approach-end cable
          engagement to the chase aircraft by extending the tailhook.
          7.5.4.2.2. The pilot of a non-escorted NORDO aircraft intending to make an
          approach-end cable engagement will fly a straight-in approach flashing the landing
          light on final to signal the tower.
7.6. Severe Weather Penetration. If unavoidable, flight leads should split up the flight and
obtain separate clearances prior to severe weather penetration.
7.7. Lost Wingman Procedures. In any lost wingman situation, immediate separation of
aircraft is essential.
   7.7.1. General Procedures. Upon losing sight of the flight/element lead or if unable to
   maintain formation the wingman will simultaneously:
       7.7.1.1. Transition to instruments.
       7.7.1.2. Execute the applicable lost wingman procedures.
       7.7.1.3. Inform lead by transmitting "C/S, lost wingman."
       7.7.1.4. Flight/Element lead must acknowledge the lost wingman's radio call and, when
       appropriate, transmit attitude, heading, altitude, airspeed, and other parameters necessary
       for safe separation.
       7.7.1.5. When able, obtain a separate clearance.
       7.7.1.6. Observe all published terrain clearance limits.
       7.7.1.7. If a wingman becomes separated and any aircraft experiences radio failure, the
       aircraft with the operational radio will obtain a separate clearance for both aircraft.
          7.7.1.7.1. The NORDO aircraft will squawk code 7600 while proceeding with the
          last known clearance.
          7.7.1.7.2. If an emergency situation arises along with radio failure, the NORDO
          aircraft will turn the IFF to EMERGENCY for the remainder of the flight.
       7.7.1.8. After executing lost wingman procedures, wingman will not attempt to rejoin
       with the flight until the flight lead clears the wingman to do so.
       7.7.1.9. Only practice lost wingman procedures in VMC.
   7.7.2. Two and Three-Ship Procedures (NOTE: For three-ship echelon, refer to four-ship
   procedures.):
       7.7.2.1. Wings-Level Flight (Climbing, Descending, or Straight and Level). Turn
       away using 15 degrees of bank for 15 seconds, then resume original heading.
       7.7.2.2. Turns.
          7.7.2.2.1. Outside the Turn. Reverse the direction of turn using 15 degrees of bank
          for 15 seconds. Continue straight ahead to ensure separation prior to resuming the
          turn.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010                                               43


          7.7.2.2.2. Inside the Turn. Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail separation
          and direct the flight lead to roll out of the turn. Maintain the original turn. The lead
          may only resume the turn when separation is ensured.
       7.7.2.3. Final Approach. Momentarily turn away from lead to ensure clearance and
       execute the published missed approach procedure.
       7.7.2.4. Missed Approach. Momentarily turn away from lead to ensure clearance and
       continue the published or assigned missed approach procedure while climbing to 500 feet
       above missed approach altitude.
   7.7.3. Three-Ship Echelon and Four-Ship Procedures. Number 2 and 3 follow the
   procedures outlined above. Number 4's initial action assumes that number 3 has also gone
   lost wingman:
       7.7.3.1. Wings-Level Flight (Climbing, Descending, or Straight and Level). Turn
       away using 30 degrees of bank for 30 seconds, then resume the original heading.
       7.7.3.2. Turns.
          7.7.3.2.1. Outside the Turn. Reverse direction of turn using 30 degrees of bank for
          30 seconds to ensure separation from lead and number 3.
          7.7.3.2.2. Inside the Turn. Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail separation
          and increase bank angle by 15 degrees. Direct the flight lead to roll out. The flight
          lead will only resume the turn when separation is ensured.
   7.7.4. Fighter – tanker lost wingman procedures are governed by ATP-56(B), Air-to-Air
   Refueling.
7.8. Spatial Disorientation (SD). Conditions which prevent a clear visual horizon or increase
pilot tasking are conducive to SD. To prevent SD, the pilot must increase his instrument cross-
check rate. If SD symptoms are encountered:
   7.8.1. Single Ship.
       7.8.1.1. Concentrate on flying basic instruments with frequent reference to the EADI or
       standby ADI if no EADI is available.
       7.8.1.2. Minimize use of the HUD.
       7.8.1.3. Consider turning on the autopilot or transferring control to the other
       crewmember.
       7.8.1.4. If symptoms persist and conditions permit, fly straight and level until symptoms
       abate.
       7.8.1.5. If necessary, declare an emergency and advise ATC.
       7.8.1.6. It is possible for SD to proceed to the point where the aircrew is unable to see or
       interpret the flight instruments. In this situation, aircraft control may be impossible. If
       this occurs, the aircrew should consider ejecting.
   7.8.2. Flight/Element Lead.
       7.8.2.1. Advise the Wingmen of the disorientation and comply with procedures in
       paragraph 7.8.1.
 44                         AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010


         7.8.2.2. Use the Wingmen to confirm attitude and provide verbal feedback.
         7.8.2.3. If symptoms persist, terminate the mission and recover the flight by the simplest
         and safest means possible.
      7.8.3. Wingman.
         7.8.3.1. Advise lead of the disorientation.
         7.8.3.2. Lead will advise wingman of aircraft attitude, altitude, heading, and airspeed.
         7.8.3.3. If symptoms persist and conditions permit, lead will establish straight and level
         flight for 30-60 seconds.
         7.8.3.4. If the above procedures are not effective flight lead should consider passing the
         lead to the wingman, provided the flight lead will be able to maintain situational
         awareness from a chase position.
             7.8.3.4.1. Change leads while in straight and level flight.
             7.8.3.4.2. Once assuming the lead, maintain straight and level flight for at least 60
             seconds if practical.
         7.8.3.5. If necessary, terminate the tactical mission and recover by the simplest and
         safest means possible.
      7.8.4. Greater Than Two-Ship Formation.
         7.8.4.1. Lead should separate the flight into elements to more effectively handle a
         wingman with persistent SD symptoms.
         7.8.4.2. Accomplish split-up IAW para 4.4 (Formation Split-up).
         7.8.4.3. Plan to keep the element with the SD pilot straight and level while the other
         element separates.
7.9. Armament System Malfunctions.
   7.9.1. General. Aircrew will not attempt to expend ordnance with a known weapons release
   malfunction.
      7.9.2. Inadvertent Release or Firing.
         7.9.2.1. Note switch positions at the time of inadvertent release or firing and provide to
         armament and safety personnel. Record the impact point if known.
         7.9.2.2. Safe the armament switches and do not attempt further release or firing in any
         mode. Treat remaining ordnance as hung and follow hung ordnance procedures during
         RTB.
         7.9.2.3. If remaining stores present a recovery hazard, jettison them in a suitable area on
         a single pass, if practical.
      7.9.3. Failure to Release, Failure to Fire, or Hung Ordnance. Note switch positions and
      PACS settings. If ordnance delivery failed with proper setup, proceed as follows:
         7.9.3.1. Live Bombs.
             7.9.3.1.1. Attempt to release store(s) using an alternate delivery mode.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010                                                   45


         7.9.3.1.2. If unsuccessful, attempt to jettison store(s) using selective jettison
         procedures.
         7.9.3.1.3. Lastly, consider attempting to selectively jettison the pylon if ordnance is
         unsecured or security cannot be determined.
         7.9.3.1.4. All release and fuze settings should be noted, then safe the system.
         7.9.3.1.5. If bombs remain on the aircraft, follow the Hung Ordnance and Weapons
         Malfunction Recovery procedures.
     7.9.3.2. Practice or Inert Bombs.
         7.9.3.2.1. Re-check switch positions and make an additional attempt to expend.
         7.9.3.2.2. If no release occurs, select an alternate delivery mode in an attempt to
         expend.
         7.9.3.2.3. If the secondary release mode fails, bombs from other stations and
         dispensers may be released providing the aircraft remains within symmetrical load
         limits. Upon RTB, follow the Hung Ordnance and Weapons Malfunction Recovery
         procedures.
  7.9.4. Missile Malfunctions.
     7.9.4.1. When abnormal missile launch or erratic missile flight is noted after launch,
     visually inspect the launching aircraft to determine if any damage has occurred.
     7.9.4.2. A missile that fires but fails to depart the aircraft is a hangfire. If this occurs, the
     missile should be closely observed and safety checked by a chase pilot.
     7.9.4.3. A missile that fails to fire when all appropriate switches were selected is a
     misfire.
     7.9.4.4. For either a hangfire or misfire safe the Master Arm switch and follow the Hung
     Ordnance and Weapons Malfunction Recovery procedures.
  7.9.5. Gun Malfunctions.
     7.9.5.1. For a hung or jammed gun immediately cease the delivery and safe the system.
     7.9.5.2. Do NOT attempt to use the gun again or further damage could result.
     7.9.5.3. If the HUD gun cross is on after selecting Master Arm Safe or the gun cannot be
     verified safe, upon landing recover to a designated Hot Gun area.
     7.9.5.4. Follow the Hung Ordnance and Weapons Malfunction Recovery procedures.
  7.9.6. Hung Ordnance and Weapons Malfunction Recovery.
     7.9.6.1. If practical, obtain a chase aircraft and visually inspect the aircraft for damage.
     7.9.6.2. Declare an emergency when carrying hung or malfunctioning live ordnance, to
     include 20mm HEI.
     7.9.6.3. Declaration of an emergency for hung practice or inert ordnance, 20mm TP, or
     live unexpended ordnance is IAW local directives and aircrew discretion.
     7.9.6.4. Avoid populated areas and trail formations.
 46                        AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010


         7.9.6.5. Land from a straight-in approach.
7.10. Post Arresting Gear Engagement Procedures.
   7.10.1. Do not shut down the engine(s) unless directed by the ground crew, there is a fire, or
   safety dictates.
   7.10.2. Raise the tailhook only on the ground crew's signal.
   7.10.3. Do not taxi until directed.
7.11. In-flight Practice of Emergency Procedures.
   7.11.1. A Simulated Emergency Procedure is defined as any procedure that produces an
   effect which closely parallels an actual emergency, such as retarding the throttle to simulate a
   flamed out engine.
   7.11.2. Only practice aborted takeoffs in the simulator, Cockpit Procedures Trainer (CPT),
   or, if the trainer is unavailable, a static aircraft.
   7.11.3. Simulated in-flight loss of both engines is prohibited.
   7.11.4. Practice in-flight engine shutdown is prohibited.
   7.11.5. Emergency Landing Patterns (also refer to AFI 11-202V3).
         7.11.5.1. Field Requirements. Practice of emergency landing patterns at active airfields
         is authorized provided that crash rescue and ATC facilities are available and in operation.
         7.11.5.2. Supervisory       Requirements. IQT        pilots    prior    to    the    initial
         instrument/qualification evaluation require an IP on board the aircraft or in chase. After
         the initial instrument/qualification evaluation, supervision will be an IP/IWSO on board
         the aircraft or in chase. MQT pilots require a SOF in place and an IP or flight lead
         monitoring from the traffic pattern.
         7.11.5.3. Pattern Procedures.
            7.11.5.3.1. Include the type of practice emergency pattern in the gear down call.
            7.11.5.3.2. Practice Single-Engine Go-Arounds.
                7.11.5.3.2.1. Initiate practice single-engine go-arounds in sufficient time to
                ensure the aircraft does not descend below 300 feet AGL.
                7.11.5.3.2.2. Simulated single-engine approaches may descend below 300 feet
                AGL provided the approach terminates in a full stop landing or the go-around
                from a low approach or touch and go landing is performed with both engines.
7.12. Search and Rescue (SAR) Procedures. If an aircraft crashes, immediately attempt to
locate possible survivors and initiate rescue efforts. Expect that the aircrew may initially suffer
from shock or have delayed reactions due to ejection injuries. The following procedures are not
exhaustive and should be adjusted to meet each unique search and rescue situation.
      7.12.1. Knock off maneuvering.
   7.12.2. Establish an On-Scene Commander (usually the wingman of the aircraft that is
   down).
AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010                                            47


   7.12.3. Notify ATC or Ground Controlled Intercept (GCI) of the emergency situation.
   Squawk 7700 if requested by control agency.
   7.12.4. Communicate the emergency situation, aircraft involved, and flight intentions
   immediately to applicable control agencies. Use GUARD (UHF and/or VHF) if necessary.
   7.12.5. Mark the last known position of survivors (and the crash site if practical) using any
   means available (e.g. TACAN, EGI/INS, ATC/GCI, visual references).
   7.12.6. Remain above the highest ejection altitude, if known, or the highest observed
   parachute until determining the position of all possible survivors.
   7.12.7. Deconflict other aircraft assisting in SAR by altitude to preclude midair collision.
   Establish high and low CAPs as necessary to facilitate communications.
   7.12.8. Revise BINGO fuels or recovery bases as required to maintain maximum SARCAP
   coverage. Do not overfly the adjusted BINGO fuel.
   7.12.9. Relinquish SAR operation to designated rescue forces upon their arrival.
   7.12.10. Follow local or briefed procedures.
7.13. Lateral Asymmetry. Reference TO 1F-15E-1, Chapter 5, for restrictions associated with
lateral asymmetries.
   7.13.1. When a fuel imbalance develops that exceeds TO 1F-15E-1 limits for maneuvering
   above 30 units AOA, terminate maneuvering and investigate.
   7.13.2. If the imbalance was caused by a slow feeding CFT, external, or internal wing tank,
   restrict flight operations to instrument procedures, deployment missions, level/climbing
   weapons deliveries, or restricted maneuvering intercepts, until the imbalance is corrected.
   7.13.3. If the fuel imbalance cannot be corrected, terminate the mission. However, the
   events listed in para 7.13.2 may be flown to reduce gross weight.
7.14. Engine Malfunctions. Report all engine anomalies during maintenance debrief.

                             LOCAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

8.1. General. This chapter is reserved for unit local operating procedures. IAW AFI 33-360,
the paragraph method is the only authorized way to supplement an AFI and added material must
be arranged according to the basic publication. Units composed of dissimilar aircraft may
publish guidance in a single, stand-alone local operating instruction (OI) instead of
supplementing this AFI. Added or stand-alone procedures will not be less restrictive than those
contained elsewhere in this volume. This chapter is not intended to be a single source document
for procedures contained in other directives or regulations. Avoid unnecessary repetition of
guidance provided in other established directives; however, reference to those directives is
acceptable when it serves to facilitate location of information necessary for local operating
procedures. This chapter is authorized to be issued to each F-15E crewmember. Units may
supplement the following paragraphs for local operating guidance:
      8.1.1. Section A. Introduction.
   8.1.1. (MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Section A. Introduction. This supplement prescribes
   operating procedures for all F-15E aircrew under the operational control of 366 FW, to
   include all visiting F-15E flying units to Mountain Home AFB (MHAFB). This supplement
   is directive in nature with intent to standardize local procedures while not restricting mission
   accomplishment. When procedures contained in this chapter are more restrictive than the
   basic publication, procedures herein have precedence.
   8.1.2. Section B. General Policy.
   8.1.2. (MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Section B. General Policy.

       authority at a deployed location. An example of when this might be necessary is a
       Category III TOLD situation at a combat airfield.
       8.1.2.1.4. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Required                               Flying
       Equipment. Reference AFI 11-301V1, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program,
       and applicable supplements for requirements. Additionally, wear survival vests
       during wing exercises and on deployment sorties. Wear of survival vests for local
       sorties is optional.
       8.1.2.1.5. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Alternate Missions. Brief alternate
       missions are IAW 11-2F-15EV3. Approved Basic Fighter Maneuvers (BFM) and
       Air-Combat Maneuvers (ACM) alternate mission parameters as listed in the 366 FW
       In Flight Guide (IFG).
          8.1.2.1.5.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) On all missions, instrument
          proficiency approaches may be flown at MHAFB provided the aircraft is not
          loaded with live ordnance (excluding 20 millimeter (mm) gun ammunition). Do
          not perform practice approaches or overhead patterns with live ordnance
          (excluding 20mm).
          8.1.2.1.5.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) MQT aircrew may fly backup
          missions in which they have previously demonstrated proficiency. They may not
          employ single ship (e.g., single bandit in ACM, low altitude tactical navigation)
          unless an instructor or squadron supervisor is in the aircraft. MQT aircrew may,
          however, fly AHC/Instruments single ship with Top 3 approval.
       8.1.2.1.6. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Orientation Flights. Familiarization
       and incentive flights are approved and conducted IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation
       Management, and applicable supplements. Squadron operations supervisor (Ops
       Sup) and pilot will confirm necessary training and paperwork is complete prior to
       briefing the sortie. The pilot will be an experienced pilot as defined in AFI 11-2F-
       15EV1, F-15E Aircrew Training. Pilot will verify/confirm the capability of the
       passenger to complete critical actions. All aspects of the flight must be clearly
       understood by the passenger. Pilots will assess the overall "readiness" of a passenger
       to complete a flight and scale back the flight profile if required.
       8.1.2.1.7. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Schedule                         Changes. Provide
       schedule changes to Wing Scheduling (366 OSS/OSOS) during normal duty hours,
       366 FW/CP (Command Post) during non-duty hours, and Supervisor of Flying (SOF).
       Coordinate with maintenance if necessary. If unanticipated delays preclude a flight
       from making its scheduled airspace times, flight lead should schedule new airspace
       times through Ops Sup to ensure airspace deconfliction from other flights. Aircrew
       may deconflict airspace real time by coordinating with Cowboy Control and flight
       leads of other formations. Squadron Ops Sup is the approval authority for changes to
       the printed schedule. Aircrew will ensure the schedule at the duty desk is accurate for
       briefed mission and routing. Flight leads will inform Ops Sup of changes to the
       briefed mission prior to takeoff. Ops Sup is the approving authority for these
       changes.

            8.1.2.1.8. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Cross-Country/Off-Station
            Training Flight Procedures. Conduct cross-country/off-station training flights IAW
            AFI 11-209, Aerial Event Policy and Procedures, and applicable supplements for
            requirements. Aircrew will reference the procedures outlined in the 366 FW IFG
            after landing at an off-station location.
            8.1.2.1.9. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Visiting Flying Units. Prior to
            flying at MHAFB, visiting flying units will reference the 366 OG/OGV CoP, and
            follow the posted instructions for visiting units. If unable to access the CoP, they
            should contact OGV directly.
            8.1.2.1.10. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Future                          Flight         Lead
            Program. Wingmen who are not yet in the two-ship flight lead (FL) upgrade may
            brief and lead portions of any two-ship mission provided an IP or four-ship FL
            qualified supervisor (CC/Director of Operations (DO)/Assistant DO (ADO)/flight
            commander) is in the element. Similarly, a qualified two-ship FL who is not yet in
            the four-ship FL upgrade may brief and lead portions of any four-ship mission
            provided an IP is in the four-ship (must be an IP in this specific instance). The IP (or
            four-ship FL qualified supervisor in a two-ship) retains overall responsibility for the
            formation.
            8.1.2.1.11. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Local Area Maps. Local area
            maps are not required when flying in the Mountain Home Range Complex (MHRC)
            per AFI 11-2F-15EV3, Chapter 2, since aircrews are required to fly with a current
            MHAFB IFG. A low-level map is not required for low altitude flying in the MHRC
            during daylight hours.

        8.1.3.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Preflight:
            8.1.3.1.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Aircrew will ensure a FOD check is
            performed in front of the aircraft out to the taxi line during preflight.
            8.1.3.1.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) IAW AFI 11-2F-15EV3, 366 OG/CC
            directs that during peacetime training missions, 366 FW aircraft will set their ejection
            seat radio beacon to AUTO, unless specific circumstances, SPINS or other directives
            take precedence.
        8.1.3.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Engine                   Start and     Taxi
        Procedures. Ground procedures are IAW MHAFBI 11-250, Airfield Operations and
        Base Flying Procedures. The following guidance also applies:
            8.1.3.2.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Do not start or taxi an aircraft into
            the parking spot next to an aircraft being refueled.
            8.1.3.2.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) The            countermeasures   dispenser
            (CMD) will be off while on the parking ramp and when ground crew are near the
            aircraft.

         8.1.3.2.3. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Aircrew shutting down an engine in
         EOR or hot pits will have a fire bottle and guard posted prior to restart.
         8.1.3.2.4. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) At night, aircraft with both taxi and
         landing light failure will use a vehicle for escort back to the parking ramp.
     8.1.3.3. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Flight Change Coordination. Flight
     leads will coordinate flight number changes with their respective squadron ops desk.
     Operations will coordinate with applicable agencies and pass changes in tail number,
     departure time, flight plan, and/or range times. If unable to contact the squadron,
     pertinent information may be passed through the Supervisor of Flying (SOF), callsign
     Shotgun, or 366 FW/CP, callsign Raymond 27.
     8.1.3.4. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Dearming            and      After              Landing
     Procedures. Ground procedures will be IAW MHAFBI 11-250. In addition:
         8.1.3.4.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Aircraft taxiing to park will give way
         to aircraft taxiing for takeoff.
         8.1.3.4.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Aircrew will not taxi an aircraft with
         a hung or suspected hung gun at any time other than to clear the runway and taxi to
         the hung gun area.
         8.1.3.4.3. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Aircrew will be responsible for
         aircraft deconfliction while taxiing. It is imperative that aircrew listen on ground
         control for aircraft taxiing out to deconflict. Aircraft taxiing out for departure will
         have priority. Tower will only be responsible for controlling a 100-foot perimeter
         around the runway. Aircrew must call ground control if it is necessary to taxi back to
         park from the ARMING area. Taxi back from arming will use the runway if air
         traffic permits. If experiencing a ground emergency while taxiing back to park,
         transmit callsign, tail number, and position on the airfield to ground control along
         with the nature of emergency. If there is an aircraft emergency while taxiing back to
         park, all other taxiing aircraft will hold position until cleared by ground control to
         proceed. Always give way to emergency vehicles. After completion of the hotpits,
         call for taxi to the active runway with the current ATIS information (IAW normal
         ops). If radio failure occurs during taxi back to parking, turn on taxi light, extend
         speed brake and continue taxiing to park.

  8.1.4. (MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Section D. Flying Operations.
     8.1.4.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Command and Control. Command and
     control of 366 FW flying operations will be exercised by 366 OG/CC through Shotgun,
     Raymond 27 and individual squadron Ops Sups.
         8.1.4.1.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) 366 FW/CP is the primary agency for
         command, control and position monitoring of off-station 366 FW aircraft. Contact
         366 FW/CP upon landing at any base other than MHAFB and pass downtimes, status
         of aircraft, proposed departure time and destination. Additionally, aircrew will
         provide 366 FW/CP and Ops Sup contact information where they can be reached.
52                     AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010


        8.1.4.1.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) During an IFE or unusual
        occurrence, the SOF is the primary command and control agency. Aircrew will
        contact the SOF as soon as time and circumstances permit. Relay nature of
        emergency condition or situation, your intentions, whether any immediate assistance
        is required, and if you anticipate closing the runway. SOF will contact appropriate
        squadron Ops Sup, and if required, direct them to the MHAFB single frequency
        approach (SFA), ultra high frequency (UHF) 271.3, to assist aircrew as necessary
        with checklist and TO 1F-15E-1, Flight Manual, information. Fire chief will also be
        available on the SFA to provide assistance to the aircrew.
     8.1.4.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Wind Restrictions. Aircrews will not
     takeoff when actual steady state surface winds are greater than 35 knots. In addition,
     aircrew will not plan missions to, or fly in areas where steady state surface winds are
     forecast to be greater than 35 knots. Flight leads will terminate missions if steady state
     surface winds are reported greater than 35 knots within their area of operation.
     Terminate training operations over water when steady state surface winds are greater than
     25 knots or wave heights are 10 feet or greater. 366 OG/CC may waive these restrictions
     on a case-by-case basis when operational constraints dictate.
     8.1.4.3. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Takeoffs:
        8.1.4.3.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Formation Takeoffs. IAW AFI 11-
        2F-15EV3, 366 OG/CC authorizes formation takeoffs if runway surface condition is
        reported wet and Airfield Management or SOF declares the center 125 feet of runway
        is clear of standing water, ice, slush and snow.
            8.1.4.3.1.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Do not conduct formation
            takeoffs or formation landings with dissimilar engine types within the 2-ship
            unless an emergency situation dictates otherwise (e.g., do not execute a formation
            takeoff or formation landing if one aircraft has -220 engines, and the other aircraft
            has -229 engines).
            8.1.4.3.1.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Quick                   Climb      Takeoffs.
            Minimum weather to perform a quick climb (maximum performance climb) is
            3,000-foot AGL ceiling, 5 NM visibilities and the ability to recover in VMC. If
            there is any doubt about the ability to recover VMC, aircrew will not perform a
            quick climb.
     8.1.4.4. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Low Level Flying:
        8.1.4.4.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Do not conduct threat reactions
        within a 5 NM radius of obstacles which are above the minimum AGL flight altitude
        (e.g., do not conduct a threat reaction at 500 feet AGL when a 700-foot tower is less
        than 5 NM away).
        8.1.4.4.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) If the Avian Hazard Advisory
        System (AHAS)/Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) condition is forecast or reported as
        severe, low-level flights in that area are restricted to no lower than 4,500 feet AGL.
        8.1.4.4.3. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) IMC TF Operations. Aircrew will
        not conduct IMC TF operations unless specifically qualified or in an approved IMC
AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010                                             53


        TF upgrade. Squadron Ops Sup will notify 366 OG/CC prior to aircrew conducting
        IMC TF.
     8.1.4.5. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Overflight of the City of Mountain
     Home. Overflight of the City of Mountain Home shall be above 10,000 feet MSL, unless
     ATC requirements dictate otherwise.
     8.1.4.6. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Instrument Procedures:
        8.1.4.6.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Do not perform instrument chase
        (i.e., for checkrides, currency or upgrade) at night.
        8.1.4.6.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) When an instrument approach is
        unavailable at night (e.g., R-3203 active and runway 12 in use), aircrew will ensure
        accurate glide path information on final using all available sources including, but not
        limited to, Instrument Landing System (ILS) glide path, runway approach lighting
        systems and PAPIs, and aircraft flight path marker.
        8.1.4.6.3. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Aircrew should avoid VFR flight
        within 30 NM of Boise TACAN within operational constraints. Limit practice
        instrument approaches at Boise Air Terminal to one per sortie unless previously
        coordinated with Boise ATC.
        8.1.4.6.4. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Twin Falls is a non-RADAR facility.
        Aircrew will be on an IFR flight plan when conducting instrument approaches at
        Twin Falls, and be especially vigilant for VFR traffic when practicing approaches
        there. Pilots will contact Twin Falls approach at least 20 miles out for sequencing
        and specify approach request on initial contact. Pilots flying a VFR pattern at Twin
        Falls will fly 7,000 feet MSL on initial, and descend to 6,000 feet MSL on turn to
        inside downwind, unless otherwise coordinated or directed. Breaks are to the south
        unless otherwise directed by ATC. Advise tower on initial contact if planning to
        conduct multiple patterns.
     8.1.4.7. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Fuel Requirements:
        8.1.4.7.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Normal Recovery Fuel.                       Normal
        recovery fuel is 3,000 pounds (the approximate fuel required to VFR divert to Boise),
        4,500 pounds at night. Land with no less than alternate fuel when an alternate has
        been declared, regardless of current weather at the field, unless landing gross weight
        and runway conditions prevent doing so. Notify SOF if this situation arises. Careful
        consideration to pad recovery fuel should be given when combinations of weather
        conditions, landing runway state, Large Force Exercise recoveries and night
        operations are present.
        8.1.4.7.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) TACAN Outage Fuel. If MHAFB is
        carrying Boise as the alternate solely due to the MHAFB TACAN being out of
        service (i.e., weather is not a factor), aircrew may fly to Boise VFR divert fuel if both
        MHAFB and Boise are VFR.
     8.1.4.8. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Diversion and Recall:
        8.1.4.8.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) When an IFR alternate is not
        required, SOF will designate a VFR divert field during flying operations. Boise is the
54                     AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010


        primary VFR divert and is assumed if no other information is distributed. SOF may
        declare other VFR divert options in the following priority: Twin Falls (only to be
        used when weather at both MHAFB and Twin Falls is >3,000/3 NM), Hill AFB,
        Naval Air Station (NAS) Fallon, or Nellis AFB. Hill AFB is the closest divert base
        with arresting gear.
        8.1.4.8.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) If an IFR alternate is required, Boise
        is the primary IFR alternate. Depending on weather, construction, airspace being
        used, etc., SOF may also consider Hill AFB, NAS Fallon, Klamath Falls, Fairchild
        AFB, Great Falls, and Nellis AFB as IFR alternates. Do not use Twin Falls as an IFR
        alternate. Limiting factors at Twin Falls include runway length, no radar approach
        controller (RAPCON) service, limited fire protection, ramp space and runway stress
        factors.
        8.1.4.8.3. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) When required to hold for an
        emergency or runway closure at MHAFB, aircrew will notify the SOF when
        approaching divert/alternate fuel. Upon reaching divert/alternate fuel, aircrew will
        divert if not immediately cleared for an approach into MHAFB. If directed to divert,
        aircrew will contact the SOF, their respective squadron, or 366 FW/CP for
        instructions if required.

  8.1.6. (MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Section F. Abnormal Procedures.
     8.1.6.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) In                 Flight     Emergency        SOF
     Coordination. When time and conditions permit, contact 366 FW SOF, callsign
     Shotgun. SOF monitors UHF 381.1 (primary) and VHF 142.125 (secondary). When
     declaring an emergency, request a change to the 366 FW single frequency approach on
     UHF 271.3, local Channel 13 if desired. The SOF will contact respective squadron Ops
     Sup to meet emergency aircraft on Channel 13 to monitor the emergency and provide
     flight manual assistance as required.
     8.1.6.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Chase Procedures:
        8.1.6.2.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Normally, emergencies are handled
        by elements. Chase aircraft will provide checklist support, flight clearing and ATC
        coordination as required by emergency aircraft.
        8.1.6.2.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) When an emergency aircraft requires
        a cable arrestment, if practical, allow chase aircraft to land first after the emergency
AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010                                             55


        aircraft's final configuration is set and confirmed and no other chase assistance is
        needed.
        8.1.6.2.3. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Aircraft                      experiencing      minor
        problems such as "gear will not retract" on takeoff or repeat level 1 over-Gs, may
        clear chase aircraft off to continue their mission once a visual inspection and checklist
        items are complete, and no other problems exist that would necessitate a chase
        aircraft.
        8.1.6.2.4. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Emergency chase aircraft will
        normally fly on the tower side of runway to not overfly emergency response vehicles.
            8.1.6.2.4.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Aircraft chasing emergencies
            with hung live ordnance will descend no lower than 1,000 feet AGL while
            chasing emergency aircraft.
        8.1.6.2.5. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Non-emergency chase aircraft (e.g.,
        IP chase for landing currency, an FE chase during a checkride) may fly on either side
        of the runway as required for safety of flight, traffic avoidance, or follow-on actions.
     8.1.6.3. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Engine                        Stall/Stagnation. Aircraft
     experiencing an engine stall or stagnation will terminate tactical maneuvering and RTB
     as soon as practical. Accomplish a battle damage check after engine anomaly.
     8.1.6.4. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Fuel Dumping. When an emergency or
     abnormal situation requires fuel dumping to reduce gross weight, advise controlling
     agency of your intentions and inform the SOF when conditions permit.
     8.1.6.5. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Cable Engagement. Notify the SOF at
     the earliest opportunity when anticipating a cable engagement. If you have a missed
     cable engagement/broken cable plan, relay to the SOF. After a successful engagement,
     await further instructions from the 366th Civil Engineer Squadron, Fire Department (366
     CES/CEF) Senior Fire Officer. 366 CES/CEF will instruct aircraft to be shut down and
     towed clear of the runway.
     8.1.6.6. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Landing Gear Extension Anomalies:
        8.1.6.6.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) For gear extension anomalies (e.g.,
        gear not indicating normal down and locked in either cockpit, emergency gear
        extension used, etc.), aircrew will declare an IFE unless they can: (1) obtain normal
        down and locked gear indications in both cockpits; and (2) a visual exterior
        inspection confirms normal gear down indications.
        8.1.6.6.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) If a normal landing is made with
        unsafe gear indication, or if the emergency gear extension is used (except on
        functional check flight (FCF) sorties), upon landing if gear/steering is confirmed
        operational, aircrew may clear the runway. Once in EOR, have maintenance
        personnel pin the affected gear. Aircrew may then taxi to parking. If the nose gear is
        the affected gear, shutdown in EOR and get towed back to parking.
     8.1.6.7. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Icing. Pilots will make a write-up on the
     appropriate AFTO Forms 781 any time aircraft experiences icing. Inspect engines for
     FOD and sign off prior to next flight.

     8.1.6.8. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Lightning Procedures. The terminology,
     "Lightning Warning," indicates lightning is observed within 5 NM of MHAFB.
     Personnel do not work on the flightline during Lightning Warning conditions. When
     Lightning Warning conditions exist, aircrew actions are predicated on the phase of the
     mission.
        8.1.6.8.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Before start:              Do not start.   Seek
        shelter and contact Ops Sup.
        8.1.6.8.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) After engine start: Contact the SOF
        and Ops Sup for further guidance. SOF will coordinate with Ops Sup to either direct
        aircrew to shut down and evacuate, or remain running and wait for storm to pass.
        Ground personnel will likely seek shelter.
        8.1.6.8.3. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) If already taxiing: Continue to EOR
        and contact SOF for further guidance. Do not arm the aircraft.
        8.1.6.8.4. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) In the arming/de-arming area (EOR):
        Aircraft will not be armed by EOR crew. If already armed, hold position until
        reaching emergency fuel, then notify SOF. SOF will notify EOR crew to de-arm
        aircraft. Ground personnel should not connect or utilize ground communication cord
        to talk to aircrew.
        8.1.6.8.5. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) In the hot pit refueling area: Stop
        refueling, hold position and contact SOF.
        8.1.6.8.6. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) In flight: Hold and contact SOF for
        further guidance. Divert if fuel or another situation dictates.

 8.1.8. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Section H.                Functional Check Flight (FCF)
 Procedure.
     8.1.8.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) FCF References. These FCF procedures
     supplement the procedures, requirements and information found in AFI 11-202V3,
     General Flight Rules, AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management,
     and MHAFB supplement; TO 1-1-300, Maintenance Operational Checks and Check
     Flights, applicable Dash 6 TOs, and applicable supplements to the preceding
     publications. AFI 11-202V3 and ACC supplement identifies requirements for local FCF
     procedures established in AFI 21-201, Conventional Munitions Maintenance
     Management, and is not repeated in this document. The intent of the following FCF
     procedures is to provide aircrew specific guidance for the FCF program.
     8.1.8.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) FCF Upgrade:
        8.1.8.2.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) FCF Aircrew Upgrade Requirements.
        Fighter Wing goal is to maintain two full FCF crews (i.e., 2 pilots and 2 WSOs) per
        squadron. Minimum requirements to enter the FCF program are listed in AFI 21-201
        and MHAFB supplement. 366 OG/CC is the waiver authority for aircrew not
AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010                                        57


       meeting the minimum requirements. F-15E FCF qualification is valid for either the -
       220 or -229 engine. F-15E FCF qualification is separate from FCF qualification in
       the F-15SG, and vice-versa, unless waived by 366 OG/CC.
       8.1.8.2.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) FCF Upgrade Flow.                       The FCF
       upgrade should be accomplished in sequential order as listed on the FCF Nomination
       and Upgrade Letter (letter maintained by FCF program office). Minimum items in
       the upgrade include a briefing from FCF officer in charge (OIC) (or Quality
       Assurance (QA)/FCF noncommissioned officer in charge (NCOIC) if OIC is
       unavailable), review of the FCF references listed in this section, plus AFI 11-418,
       Operations Supervision, and MHAFBI 11-250, review of local FCF procedures
       contained in the QA/FCF program office, review of applicable aircraft -6, -6CF, and -
       6 checklist, review and sign-off all active MHAFB FCF read files, pass the MHAFB
       FCF test (passing score is 85%, corrected to 100%), accomplish a full FCF profile in
       the simulator and fly a full FCF sortie. Upgrading FCF aircrew must complete all
       other items in the upgrade prior to flying the upgrade FCF sortie. The FCF OIC in
       coordination with 366 OG/CC may waive FCF sortie for previously certified F-15E
       FCF aircrew. All other items must be completed.
       8.1.8.2.3. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) FCF                    Upgrade        Supervision.
       Supervision for upgrading FCF aircrew (pilot or WSO) during FCF simulator and
       sortie will be an FCF-qualified IP (must have FCF currency), or the wing FCF OIC (if
       a pilot and qualified in the aircraft). If an FCF-qualified IP is not available, 366
       OG/CC may approve, on a case-by-case basis, an FCF-qualified pilot to serve as
       supervision on upgrade FCF simulators or sorties.
       8.1.8.2.4. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) FCF Syllabus. The FCF program
       office maintains the FCF syllabus. The syllabus contains lesson plans for ground
       training, upgrade simulator, upgrade sortie and CT simulator. All FCF aircrew will
       reference this syllabus.
       8.1.8.2.5. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) FCF Upgrade Sortie Requirements.
       Upgrading FCF aircrew will complete all other items in the upgrade prior to flying
       upgrade FCF sortie. The FCF upgrade sortie will include the full FCF profile per -6
       TO. The FCF upgrade sortie may be flown in conjunction with an actual FCF sortie.
       If the FCF profile is incomplete during the sortie, the upgrade sortie may be
       considered complete at the discretion of the FCF IP (upgrade supervision) with
       concurrence from FCF OIC.
       8.1.8.2.6. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) FCF Certification.                      Following
       successful completion of all requirements on the FCF Nomination and Upgrade
       Letter, upgrading FCF aircrew will forward the completed letter to the FCF OIC (or
       QA/FCF NCOIC if OIC is unavailable). The FCF office will begin routing the FCF
       Certification Letter. Aircrew is not FCF certified (qualified) until 366 OG/CC signs
       their respective FCF Certification Letter.
     8.1.8.3. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) FCF Currency:
       8.1.8.3.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) FCF currency applies to both FCF
       flight currency and FCF test currency. Aircrew FCF currencies are outlined in AFI
58                     AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010


        21-201 and MHAFB supplement. Accomplishing an FCF simulator or flying an FCF
        sortie updates FCF flight currency. Aircrew must have FCF currency (both flight and
        test currencies) prior to flying an FCF sortie. 366 OG/CC approval is required to fly
        an FCF sortie if either crew member is out of FCF currency. As soon as practical
        after completing an FCF simulator or sortie, aircrew will notify both FCF OIC and
        QA/FCF NCOIC to update their FCF currency appropriately.
        8.1.8.3.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) FCF aircrew is required to take the
        FCF test annually (i.e., 12-month currency). Aircrew noncurrent with the FCF test
        will not fly an FCF sortie until they successfully pass the FCF test, unless approved
        by 366 OG/CC. The FCF OIC or QA/FCF NCOIC will administer the FCF test.
        8.1.8.3.3. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) FCF aircrew must have demanding
        mission currency (IAW AFI 11-2F-15EV1) to fly an FCF sortie.
        8.1.8.3.4. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) FCF aircrew must be current on all
        active FCF aircrew read-files prior to flying an FCF sortie. To be current, FCF
        aircrew must have read and physically signed off all active FCF aircrew read-files.
        The QA/FCF NCOIC maintains the FCF aircrew read-files and the associated sign-
        off log. FCF aircrew will check with QA/FCF NCOIC prior to flying an FCF sortie
        to ensure they are current on all active FCF aircrew read-files.
     8.1.8.4. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) FCF Sortie Coordination and Procedures:
        8.1.8.4.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) QA/FCF Coordination. Preferably
        the day before the FCF sortie, FCF aircrew will coordinate with QA/FCF program
        office for a time to meet and review applicable aircraft forms. Aircrew will review
        the full aircraft forms and receive a briefing from QA/FCF NCOIC on the
        background of the aircraft and why it is being flown as an FCF. Aircrew will also
        confirm the status of the aircraft, configuration, if jumper cables are installed and the
        availability of external power with QA/FCF NCOIC.
        8.1.8.4.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Daylight Scheduling Requirements.
        IAW TO 1-1-300, Maintenance Operational Checks and Check Flights, conduct the
        FCF sortie during daylight hours. FCF aircrew will not takeoff prior to official
        sunrise and will plan to land no later than (NLT) 1 hour prior to official sunset;
        aircrew will compute a NLT step and takeoff time to comply with these restrictions.
        If the FCF sortie is extended while airborne, aircrew must land NLT official sunset.
        8.1.8.4.3. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Weather and Altitude Requirements.
        IAW TO 1-1-300, FCFs fly in VMC conditions unless waived by 366 OG/CC.
        Weather minimums to fly FCF sortie are 3,000 feet/5 NM. 366 OG/CC approval is
        required to conduct FCFs with flight conditions less than 3,000 feet/5 NM or anytime
        weather must be penetrated to reach VMC conditions. 366 OG/CC may waive
        weather minimums on a case-by-case basis to 1,500 feet/3 NM. Weather minimums
        apply to prevailing and intermittent weather conditions for the planned duration of the
        sortie, plus 1 hour. Aircrew will strive to maintain VMC to the maximum extent
        possible. Conduct all FCF checks in VMC conditions. A minimum of 5,000 feet of
        continuous VMC vertical airspace is required below the aircraft to begin the High
AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010                                         59


       AOA rig check. Additionally, during the High AOA rig check, aircraft must start
       above 15,000 feet AGL and terminate NLT 10,000 feet AGL.
       8.1.8.4.4. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) 366 OG/CC Coordination. Prior to
       flying the sortie, FCF aircrew will notify 366 OG/CC of the FCF flight and pass the
       following information: aircraft tail number, reason for FCF, aircrew names and
       expected takeoff and landing times. If FCF aircrews anticipate encountering any
       weather limitations listed in this section, they will receive 366 OG/CC approval prior
       to stepping onto the aircraft.
       8.1.8.4.5. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) SOF Coordination. Prior to flying
       the sortie, FCF aircrew will notify SOF (or Ops Sup if a SOF is not required IAW
       AFI 11-418) of the FCF flight and pass the same information as was passed to 366
       OG/CC. Additionally, aircrew will pre-brief SOF about specific FCF profile
       requirements that SOF should be aware of, to include taxi and brake checks on
       taxiway alpha, extended checks on the runway prior to takeoff, quick climb and anti-
       skid brake check upon landing.
       8.1.8.4.6. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Aircrew Coordination Briefing.
       Aircrew will brief TO 1F-15E-6CF-1, Acceptance and Functional Check Flight
       Procedures, requirements for FCF sortie and cover steps to be omitted. Additionally,
       crews should brief individual techniques on how they will prepare for actions IAW
       TO 1F-15E-6CL-1, Acceptance and Functional Check Flight Checklist, execute them
       and whether the FCF profile is to be terminated if an actual emergency or other
       situation occurs.
       8.1.8.4.7. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Aircraft Crew Chief Coordination.
       Aircrew will ensure aircraft crew chief and ground personnel are aware of the FCF
       profile ground requirements and pre-brief such as timing the tail hook drop, extra
       flight control checks, and other instances where ground crew personnel assistance is
       required. Operable two-way intercom between aircrew and crew chief is required
       while doing ground checks in the chocks.
       8.1.8.4.8. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Ground and Flight Checks. FCF
       crews will complete preflight external electrical power checks IAW the -6 checklist
       TO. FCF aircrew must ensure they accomplish all normal checklist items IAW the -1
       checklist not included in the -6 checklist. Comply with applicable supersonic
       restrictions for the airspace utilized.
       8.1.8.4.9. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Recording Procedures.                      Aircrew
       should take an 8mm tape and/or a digital video recording system (DVRS) cartridge
       on FCF sorties. FCF aircrew will begin recording prior to taking the runway for
       initial takeoff and record the entire sortie through landing roll-out. Aircrew should
       record the HUD and engine page at all times, except during flight control checks
       when aircrew should record the HUD and EADI at a minimum. As a technique to aid
       in FCF tape review, select NAV master mode to display bank angle in the HUD.
     8.1.8.5. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Off-Station/Deployed FCF Procedures:
       8.1.8.5.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) If a full FCF qualified crew is not
       available, 366 OG/CC, in coordination with the off-station/deployed location
 60                       AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010


            equivalent OG/CC, may issue a temporary FCF certification to the most qualified
            aircrew member(s). The FCF OIC, or most experienced FCF IP or pilot if the FCF
            OIC is unavailable, must thoroughly brief the temporary FCF aircrew member(s) on
            FCF procedures and requirements prior to FCF sortie.
            8.1.8.5.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) FCF aircrew must coordinate for
            airspace considerations to include supersonic and special use airspace to complete
            FCF profile.

    CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, NUCLEAR, AND HIGH YIELD
                   EXPLOSIVE (CBRNE) OPERATIONS

A2.1. General Information. Potential adversary use of CBRNE weapons against a friendly
airfield presents a serious threat to flying operations. Although the most effective way for
aircrews to avoid this threat is to be airborne before these weapons are detonated or dispersed
and then land at a field that has not been contaminated, all personnel must be prepared to operate
from a field that has come under CBRNE attack.
A2.2. Mission Preparation. Be aware of the status of the CBRNE environment at the planned
launch and recovery airfields, potential divert bases, and throughout the area in which the sortie
may fly. Know the current and forecast surface wind direction and on the MOPP level in effect
for relevant sectors of the airfield. Don appropriate aircrew chemical defense equipment
(ACDE) or Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE) to match the appropriate MOPP level (reference
AFMAN 10-100) and carry individual protective equipment (IPE) as required.
A2.3. Stepping to Fly and Aircraft Preflight. This may entail donning ACDE or transitioning
from GCE to ACDE. Take precautions to protect aircrew from injury and or contamination
while in transit from the squadron facility to the aircraft. If possible, transport aircrew in a
vehicle that provides overhead cover (enclosed vehicle). If aircrew travel on foot is unavoidable,
choose a route that takes maximum advantage of available overhead cover (sun shades,
buildings, etc.) to avoid agents that may be settling from the air. If extra aircrew members are
available for preflight duties, consider assigning them to do so wearing GCE. This will allow the
aircrew actually flying to minimize exposure.
   A2.3.1. Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) Prior to Engine Start. If Alarm Red occurs
   during the step or preflight process, take cover and don appropriate MOPP. This may require
   use of the ground crew mask. A hardened aircraft shelter (HAS) provides optimum
   protection, if available. Use caution if entering a HAS that contains aircraft or equipment.
   Close doors after entry. If a HAS or other overhead cover is not immediately available,
   accept the best rapidly reachable cover.
A2.4. Engine Start to Takeoff. If a HAS is available, use it to minimize exposure time by
accomplishing aircraft arming and EOR procedures inside the HAS (if local procedures permit)
and by delaying taxi time as long as possible prior to takeoff.
   A2.4.1. Aircraft Launch to Survive. Units will develop local procedures to provide this
   option to the commander. In general, aircraft may launch-to-survive any time after engine
   start if they have sufficient fuel and safe, expeditious access to a runway. This option may
   only be practical for aircraft that are near the end of runway (EOR) prior to takeoff or that
   have just landed.
   A2.4.2. Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) Prior to Taxi. If in a HAS, the normal
   procedure is to shut down. Ensure ground personnel are aware of the alarm warning, as
   engine noise may preclude effectiveness of normal alert notification procedures. Use hand
   signals if necessary to be sure that ground personnel assume proper MOPP and close HAS
   doors. If not in a HAS, procedures may include launch to survive.
 72                       AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010


   A2.4.3. Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) After Taxi. Units typically establish
   procedures for this contingency depending on whether additional protection is available
   along the taxi route. For instance, if empty HAS are available, taxiing aircraft may be
   directed to shelter there. Ideally, ground crew sheltering in such a HAS would be available
   to assist in normal engine shutdown procedures and to close HAS doors. If protection is not
   available, the best option may be launch to survive. Maintain contact with Command and
   Control (C2) entities (Wing Operations Center, Maintenance Operations Center, Supervisor
   of Flying, etc.) to ensure unity of effort in the overall plan.
A2.5. Takeoff to Landing.
   A2.5.1. Contamination. If Chemical Warfare (CW) agent contamination occurs prior to
   takeoff, flying the aircraft will dissipate the agent to some degree. The greatest dissipation
   will occur during flights at lower altitudes and longer airborne times. Because the agent may
   have entered wheel wells, flaps, etc., consider flying in landing configuration to increase
   airflow to these areas. However, merely flying the aircraft is unlikely to achieve complete
   decontamination.
   A2.5.2. Preparing to Land. Aircrew should remain aware of the status of primary and
   alternate landing locations. Do not attempt to land during Alarm Red situations unless there
   is no other option. Follow C2 directions and either hold or divert. If mission needs prevent
   divert, hold until the Alarm Red (or theater equivalent) has cleared or become an Alarm
   Black. Prior to landing, gain awareness of contaminated sectors of the airfield and of
   current/forecast surface winds. Use this information in conjunction with C2 direction to plan
   a route from landing to engine shutdown. The liquid deposition phase following a CW
   airburst attack can extend up to 1 hour. If landing during Alarm Black, expect a
   contaminated environment and MOPP 4.
A2.6. Landing to Engine Shutdown. Take advantage of any protection available, minimizing
taxi time and distance. Maintain contact with C2 in order to remain aware of unexploded
ordnance and/or damage to airfield movement surfaces. If a HAS is available and local
procedures permit, accomplish aircraft de-arm and EOR procedures there. If Alarm Red (or
Theater Equivalent) occurs between landing and engine shutdown, considerations are similar to
those in para A2.4.
A2.7. After Engine Shutdown. Don appropriate MOPP. If circumstances permit, accomplish
normal post-flight inspection procedures. If the aircraft is not contaminated, close the canopy. If
there is any suspicion of personnel contamination, aircrew will process through an aircrew
contamination control area (ACCA). Accomplish maintenance debriefings under cover to the
maximum extent possible.

                               MASTER ARM PROCEDURES

F-15E/F-15SG: MASTER ARM/PACS GUIDANCE
366 FW F-15E and F-15SG aircrew will comply with the following procedures for PACS set-up,
Master Arm and pickle/trigger operations. The following guidance is intended to enhance what
is identified in AFI 11-2F-15EV3, paragraph 6.2. and AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and
Procedures, paragraphs 4.2.5., 5.1.1. and 5.6.. Adhere to range regulations and restrictions if
more restrictive.
GENERAL
Crews will not initially Master Arm (including trigger checks) over populated areas. Crews will
never load ―simulated‖ ordnance on any station that holds carted munitions.
EXAMPLE #1: Crews may not load a Training PACS Guided Bomb Unit (GBU)-24 on Station
5 if an actual Suspended Utility Unit (SUU)-20 with Bomb Dummy Unit (BDU)-33s is there.
EXAMPLE #2: Crews may load Training PACS GBU-39s on a station where there is an empty
Bomb Release Unit (BRU)-61 because no carted munitions exist.
NO A/G STORES LOADED
No restrictions on Master Arm procedures or pickling.
BDU-33s LOADED
A/A Master Mode (MM):
Aircraft may Master Arm hot and employ simulated A/A ordnance provided:
SUU-20 is deselected in all programs of the Combat PACS.
A/G MM:
Off-Range Attacks:
Master Arm safe, no pickle for attacks over inhabited areas or where unintentional release may
cause injury. Training PACS deliveries may be conducted (Master Arm hot and pickle) over
uninhabited areas provided:
SUU-20 is deselected in all programs of the Combat PACS.
Off-range attacks require sound aircrew judgment and in-flight discipline.
Once SUU-20 is visually confirmed empty, no restrictions.
On-Range Attacks:
Once flight is within the confines of the range as defined by the local AFI 13-212 Addendum A
or supplement, crews may select the SUU in the Combat PACS and perform range authorized
deliveries or leave the SUU deselected and perform Training PACS deliveries on unmanned
targets.
EXAMPLE #1: Attacking an unmanned no-drop site: Training PACS (with SUU deselected in
Combat PACS), Master Arm Hot and cleared to pickle.
 102                      AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010


EXAMPLE #2: Attacking a town or inhabited target: Training PACS (with SUU deselected in
Combat PACS), No Master Arm, No pickle.
HOT GUN (LOADED OR UNLOADED)
A/A MM: Master Arm Safe, no pickle, no trigger.
Air to Ground (A/G) MM: Off-range attacks are prohibited.
COLD GUN (LOADED OR UNLOADED)
Simulated strafe is permitted with a cold gun if a trigger check is previously accomplished.
HEAVYWEIGHT INERT LOADED
Aircraft are required to avoid populated areas to the max extent possible
A/A MM:
Aircrew may Master Arm hot and employ simulated A/A ordnance provided: The flight is
within the confines of a MOA, Air Traffic Control Assigned Airspace (ATCAA), Restricted
Area or other approved area for tactical A/A operations. Stations with actual ordnance are
deselected in all A/G Combat PACS programs and A/G Training PACS is selected.
A/G MM:
Off-Range Attacks: Prohibited.
On-Range Attacks: Once flight is within the confines of the range as defined by the local AFI
13-212 Addendum A or supplement, crews may select the inerts in the Combat PACS and
perform range authorized deliveries or leave the inerts deselected and perform Training PACS
deliveries on unmanned targets. EXAMPLE: MHRC Surface Attack Tactics (SAT) sortie
carrying BDU-50s. Crews will ensure the A/G PACS is setup per the above restrictions. Crews
may Fence In normally and employ simulated A/A ordnance during the ingress/egress. Once the
flight arrives on Saylor Creek Range, they may select the BDU-50s in the Combat PACS.
LIVE LOADED
Aircraft are required to avoid populated areas to the maximum extent possible. The Master Arm
switch must remain in the safe position until within the range boundaries specified by the local
AFI 13-212 Addendum A or supplement, ready for delivery, with intent to expend. Flight leads
are responsible for ensuring flight members receive an airspace brief explaining where aircraft
may be armed hot. In most of the airspace that 366 FW utilizes Utah Test and Training Range
(UTTR), Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR), etc.), only specific portions of the ―    range
complex‖ allow aircraft to be armed-hot with live ordnance. If the AFI 13-212 Addendum A or
supplement does not clarify where aircraft may be Master Armed hot, flight leads will contact
the range manager for guidance.
A/A MM:
Remain Master Arm safe, no pickle, no trigger for A/A engagements until after live ordnance has
been confirmed expended.
A/G MM:
Off-Range Attacks: Prohibited. Aircrew must remain Master Arm safe, no pickle, no trigger,
until within the appropriate range boundaries.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 12 APRIL 2010                                         103


On-Range Attacks: Once flight is within the confines of the range allowing Master Arm hot with
lives, as defined by the local AFI 13-212 Addendum A or verbal confirmation as described
above, crews may select the lives in the Combat PACS and Master Arm hot to perform range
authorized deliveries. Training PACS deliveries are not authorized until lives have been
confirmed expended. EXAMPLE: Red Flag sortie with live GBU-10s. Crews carrying live
ordnance will remain Master Arm Safe until within the appropriate range complex IAW AFI 13-
212 (local Addendum or supplement). Upon entry into that range airspace, ready for delivery
and with intent to expend, crews may Master Arm hot, select the live ordnance in the Combat
PACS and perform range authorized deliveries. No A/A Training PACS employment is
authorized while lives are on the aircraft.
