                        EXTERNAL INTELLIGENCE TRAINING

3.1. Introduction. There are two types of EIT: Aircrew Intelligence Training (AIT) and Force
Protection Intelligence Training (FPIT). AIT will be coordinated with the wing/group tactics
flight or officer. FPIT will be coordinated with force protection (FP) organizations (e.g.,
Security Forces (SF) and Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI)) as defined in AFI
14-119, Intelligence Support to Force Protection (FP). (T-2)
   3.1.1. AIT is EIT provided to the units’ assigned and attached aircrew and operators. Where
   assigned, the Intelligence Weapons Instructor Course or Intelligence Sensor and Weapons
   Instructors Course graduate will be directly responsible for the management of the AIT
   program. (T-3)
   3.1.2. FPIT is EIT provided by the host unit intelligence function to the unit’s SF and other
   FP support agencies (e.g., AFOSI, Civil Engineering). FPIT will be conducted IAW AFI 14-
   119 and supporting documents. When possible, a FP Intelligence Formal Training Unit
   graduate will be responsible for the management of the FPIT program. If the intelligence
   function is not part of the host unit, the tenant unit responsibilities in AFI 14-119 will be
   adhered to. (T-3)
   3.1.3. Training methods can include, but are not limited to briefings, demonstration-
   performance, formal and informal lectures, and academic training sessions. (T-3)
   3.1.4. Training resources can include, but are not limited to threat briefings, current
   intelligence briefings, theater orientation briefings, CDs/DVDs or web-based training
   materials, and weapons system videos. (T-3)
3.2. SIO Responsibilities. The SIO will:
   3.2.1. Establish an EIT program tailored to the unit’s mission, weapons system(s), projected
   wartime/Air and Space Expeditionary Force tasking and base/deployment location(s). (T-2)
   3.2.2. Appoint program manager(s) to oversee AIT and FPIT execution. (T-3)
   3.2.3. Assign only qualified EIT trainers to conduct unsupervised EIT events. AFI 14-2RC-
   135, Volumes 1 and 2 identify specialized training requirements and evaluation criteria for
   EIT trainers. (T-3)
   3.2.4. Ensure written guidance outlines procedures for conducting, documenting, testing,
   evaluating, monitoring and reporting EIT. List specific training objectives for each major
   area of intelligence training and the training method and resources used to satisfy each
   objective. (T-3)
   3.2.5. Coordinate EIT written instructions with all applicable commanders. Written
   guidance will be coordinated with any agency that assists intelligence personnel in providing
   training, as well as, any agency for which intelligence training is provided on a regularly
   scheduled basis. (T-3)
   3.2.6. Develop intelligence training for other base/unit personnel, if appropriate. (T-3)
3.3. Aircrew Intelligence Training.

    3.3.1. The AIT program manager will:
       3.3.1.1. Build an effective training program, including training plans, with input from
       operational squadrons, tactics representatives, aircrew flight equipment (AFE) personnel,
       SF personnel, AFOSI, and Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) specialists,
       as appropriate. (T-2)
       3.3.1.2. Review training objectives for currency prior to the beginning of the training
       cycle. (T-3)
       3.3.1.3. Actively solicit feedback to ensure training objectives are meeting training
       requirements. (T-3)
       3.3.1.4. Conduct trend analysis following each training cycle; document lessons learned
       and apply those lessons during subsequent cycles. (T-3)
       3.3.1.5. Provide a written evaluation of the wing/group AIT program to the appropriate
       commander(s) at the end of each training cycle. The written evaluation will include at a
       minimum: the percent or number of personnel trained; trend analysis (e.g., high miss
       questions, weak areas); and corrective actions taken. Incorporate feedback as applicable.
       (T-3)
    3.3.2. Squadron intelligence personnel will:
       3.3.2.1. Provide input to and execute the AIT program. (T-2)
       3.3.2.2. Provide questions and answers specific to the squadron's mission for the unit
       master question file (MQF). (T-3)
       3.3.2.3. Administer AIT tests at the end of each training cycle. (T-3)
       3.3.2.4. Document AIT provided. Documentation of AIT will include the names of
       personnel receiving training, date training was accomplished, the topic taught, and the
       name of the trainer conducting the training. In addition, they will provide a written
       evaluation of the squadron’s AIT program to the squadron commander and the SIO (see
       attachment 2). (T-3)
    3.3.3. The AIT plan will be specifically tailored to meet unit/mission requirements. Teach
    each item in the AIT training plan at least once during the training cycle. Evaluate the
    objectives for each AIT category with a test. Personnel covered by the training plan will pass
    each test with a minimum score of 85% correctable to 100% via a review of the missed test
    items with an EIT trainer. (T-3)
    3.3.4. Prorate training based on unit contingency operations tempo IAW the appropriate AFI
    11-2MDS, Volume 1. Details of the prorating schedule must be outlined in the AIT Plan
    and/or other written instructions. (T-3)
    3.3.5. Aircrew intelligence training categories include threat knowledge, visual recognition
    (VR), collection and reporting (C&R), and personnel recovery (PR). Include other categories
    based on the unit’s mission as required. (T-2)
       3.3.5.1. Threat Knowledge. Develop specific threat knowledge training objectives
       tailored to the unit mission, local area, deployment base(s), and forward operating
       locations. Concentrate on threats in selected countries with the potential for direct unit
AFI14-2RC-135V3 4 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                  9


       involvement. Refer to attachment 3 for minimum standards for threat briefings. The
       references listed at the beginning of this instruction can be supplemented with other
       classified and unclassified publications (e.g., National Air and Space Intelligence Center
       products, Tactics Bulletins, Tactics Analysis Reports, Country Studies) when developing
       threat knowledge training materials.
       3.3.5.2. Visual Recognition. Develop specific VR training objectives tailored to the RC-
       135 weapons system, mission, base and forward operating locations.                  Include
       enemy/adversary, friendly or neutral weapon systems relevant to the operational
       environment, based on unit mission and operations plan (OPLAN)/concept of operations
       plan (CONPLAN) tasking. Identify key differences between friendly weapons systems
       and threat weapon system look-alikes. Incorporate all aspects/angles, theater specific
       paint schemes, national markings and various configurations. Include examples of
       weapons employment to illustrate how threats might appear when employed (e.g., muzzle
       flashes, smoke plumes, burst patterns). Training should teach aircrew/operators how to
       describe threats they encounter to assist intelligence personnel in positive identification.
       VR training can be limited to aircrew members who have a visual vantage point outside
       the aircraft.
       3.3.5.3. Collection and Reporting. Collection and reporting training will focus on items
       necessary to enable aircrew to initiate aircrew-originated reports to capture perishable,
       critical information of intelligence value (e.g., In-flight Report (INFLTREP),
       Communications Instructions Reporting Vital Intelligence Sightings) and familiarize
       them with the information requirements of the intelligence-generated Mission Report
       (MISREP) and Intelligence Report (INTREP). A critical component of C&R training
       will be the unit’s essential elements of information (EEI). Training will identify and
       describe theater-specific and peacetime reporting requirements.
       3.3.5.4. Personnel Recovery. When assigned, a SERE specialist will conduct PR
       operational support training. The SERE specialist will coordinate PR operations support
       training requirements with intelligence and AFE personnel and document these
       requirements in a memorandum of agreement (MOA). Units without SERE personnel
       will coordinate an MOA with AFE and operations. This category will be omitted if
       intelligence personnel do not provide any PR operational support training to aircrew. If

4. The most commonly missed questions were #5, 8, 13, 14 and 21. After further review of
questions 14 and 21, it is likely these questions were missed because they were poorly worded
and difficult to understand. Questions 5, 8, and 13 focused on the SA-2, SA-6, and MiG-29
respectively. The squadron intelligence section will increase emphasis on these threat systems
during the next training cycle. Attached is a breakout of the test questions and how many times
each question was missed.
