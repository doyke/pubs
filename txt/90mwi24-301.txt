4. Temporary Duty Personnel. The following local policies, concerning TDY personnel have
been implemented to help minimize misuse, better ensure efficient support, and help expedite
misuse investigations.
   4.1. The TDY status of an individual does not necessarily justify the use of a U-Drive-It
   (UDI) vehicle. Justification will always be predicated on need, distance involved, and other
   mission-related conditions.
   4.2. The commercial taxi service of Cheyenne are considered viable transportation options
   unless proven otherwise.
   4.3. Personnel TDY for less than 7 days will normally be supported via methods in 4.2.
   4.4. Personnel TDY for more than 7 days will coordinate support through the sponsoring
   unit’s VCO/VCNCO.
       4.4.1. Personnel without a sponsoring unit will contact 90 LRS/Vehicle Operations
       directly.
   4.5. The sponsoring unit will sign for and assume full responsibility for the vehicle(s) to
   include reported misuse/accident investigations.
   4.6. TDY personnel may travel via GMV to:
       4.6.1. Lodging
       4.6.2. On-base eating establishments only.       Exception:    when performing official
       business outside Cheyenne city limits.
       4.6.3. AAFES facilities
       4.6.4. Places of worship
       4.6.5. Non-appropriated fund facilities.
   4.7. TDY personnel may NOT travel via GMV to:
       4.7.1. Off-base establishments when billeted on-base.
       4.7.2. Private quarters on or off-base.
       4.7.3. On-base eating establishment drive through windows.

       5.1.1. Personal business or pleasure to include on-base eating establishments.
       5.1.2. Transportation between domicile and duty to include dormitories, military
       housing, temporary lodging facilities and off-base private residences.
       5.1.3. Terminal transportation to commercial airports, train and bus stations.

6. Permissible Operating Distance (POD). The POD is that distance from the installation that
GMVs travel before competing with commercial carriers (Ref. DoD Directive 4500.9). The
POD for GMWs at F. E. Warren AFB extends north to Guernsey, WY, South to Colorado
Springs, CO, East to Ogallala, NE and West to Jackson, WY. Travel beyond these limits
requires written justification and authorization prior to commencement of travel. Submit
requests to Vehicle Dispatch for review and final approval by the 90 LRS Commander acting as
the F. E. Warren AFB POD designee IAW DoD Instruction 4500.36R, para C2.2.3.3.4.
7. Off-Base. IAW AFI 24-301, paragraph 3.7.1, personnel conducting official off-base duties
are authorized to stop at off-base establishments in the immediate vicinity of the off-base work
site. This does not include eating or stopping at private quarters. IAW AFI 24-301, paragraph
3.1.1, Attachment 9, rule 5, Official travel to commercial terminals in general is not authorized.
Terminal transportation is only authorized for emergency situations (e.g., natural disasters,
enemy attacks, and large scale deployments) and to fulfill security requirements (e.g.,
transporting prisoners, government issued weapons and movement of personnel in high threat
environments). The result of the terminal transportation analysis reflects the most cost effective
mode to travel to or from Cheyenne Regional and Denver International Airport will be
commercial transportation for up to 6 personnel.
8. On-Base. IAW AFI 24-301, paragraph 3.9.1, the installation commander has approved the
use of GMVs by ICBM personnel enroute to the missile field and emergency response forces
(e.g., law Enforcement and Fire Department) for travel to on-base military facilities when on
duty. The eating establishments personnel are authorized to utilize on F. E. Warren are Chadwell
Dining Facility, Burger King, Shopette, Subway, Cavalry café, BX, Missile Grill, and
NAF/AAFES/DECA operated eating establishments. This does not include private quarters,
dormitories, commissary, automatic teller machines or banks. Such stops are considered
“personal use” of GMVs and are strictly prohibited under all circumstances.
9. Pet Transportation Support: IAW AFI 24-301, paragraph 3.19, each organization must
develop its own local policy directives for the transport of family pets. Commanders should only
allow this pursuant to official business; i.e., PCS. GMVs should be used on a space-available
basis with no detriment to the mission. The family pet must always be under the control of the
owner, either leashed or caged, in order to ensure the safety of the driver and passengers.
Owners will be held responsible for the behavior of their pets and any costs associated to damage
caused by the pet.
