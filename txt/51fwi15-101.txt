                                          Chapter 1

                               GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Introduction. The mission of the 51 OSS Weather Flight (WF) is to provide relevant,
tactical weather support enabling the 51 FW and tenant Osan flying units to execute combat
operations as directed by the Air Component Commander. The WF provides and arranges
weather services to 51 FW and other units assigned to Osan AB, Republic of Korea (ROK). This
document establishes requirements and procedures for areas of weather support that must be
coordinated at the local level to meet mission needs. It consolidates weather support
requirements and procedures for armistice operations and eliminates the need for written
agreements between the weather unit and supported organizations. It does not cover weather
support for Emergency War Orders (EWO).
   1.1.1. The WF provides weather support IAW Air Force Instruction (AFI) 10-229,
   Responding to Severe Weather Events, AFI 15-114, Functional Resource and Weather
   Technical Performance Evaluation, AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations,
   AFMAN 15-124, Meteorological Codes, AFI 15-128, Air Force Weather Roles and
   Responsibilities, AFMAN 15-129V1 and AFMAN 15-129V2. The 17th Operational
   Weather Squadron (17 OWS), located at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii is the
   servicing OWS for Osan AB. The 17 OWS collaborates with the WF to provide weather
   forecasting, advisory, watch, and warning services to Osan AB.
   1.1.2. The WF is the focal point for all tactical weather support to Osan AB and the 51 FW.
   1.1.3. The 607th Weather Squadron (607 WS), headquartered at Yongsan Army Garrison,
   provides full spectrum weather support to Eighth United States Army (EUSA). 607 WS also
   provides headquarters staff weather support to United Nations Command (UNC), Combined
   Forces Command (CFC), and United States Forces Korea (USFK).
   1.1.4. The 607th Combat Operations Division Weather Specialty Team (607 COD/CODW),
   located in the Hardened Theater Air Control Center (HTACC) on Osan AB, supports the
   Korean Air and Space Operations Center with planning weather and Meteorological Watch
   (METWATCH) at the operational level during mission execution. 607 COD/CODW also
   arranges for the armistice weather support requirements for the five 7 AF collocated
   operating bases and provides staff weather support to 7 AF.
1.2. Weather Terms Explained. There are several terms and acronyms used extensively
throughout this document.
   1.2.1. Osan AB, for weather purposes, is defined as the area within a 5 Nautical Mile (NM)
   radius from the center of the runway.
   1.2.2. WF is an umbrella term covering any military weather organization providing direct,
   tactical level support. OSW and WF are used interchangeably throughout this document.
   The WF is ultimately responsible for providing support in three areas:
       1.2.2.1. Airfield Services Element (ASE): Ensuring the base‘s resources is protected by
       issuing observed Watch, Warning, Advisories (WWAs), and overseeing any TAFs that

2.7. Mission Execution Forecast (MEF) Support.
   2.7.1. The WF, through its MWE, provides target acquisition and flight planning data to the
   5 RS, 25 FS and 36 FS based on the daily flying schedule. The MWE works closely with
   pilots and leadership within each squadron to provide this information as part of regularly
   scheduled briefings.     Pilots must coordinate with MWE forecasters for additional
   requirements. MEF slides for the 5 RS, 25 FS, and 36 FS are not amended. However, verbal
   updates are provided to SOF for the 25 FS and 36 FS and to the 5 RS Operations Desk or
   Mobile Officer for changes which could impact their operations. Furthermore, the AMEF is
   amendable and will be updated to all flying customers IAW with duty priorities, paragraph
   1.3. Squadron weather sensitivities are monitored during valid times of briefings (as a part of
   MISSIONWATCH) and are documented in Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).
   2.7.2. The WF has the capability to provide target acquisition data to any 51 FW flying
   customer operating from Osan AB. All attached units will notify the WF at 784-

  of severe weather. Identification of severe weather events that can adversely affect the base
  or cause mission degradation need to be assessed to determine the probability and severity of
  those events. This information is an essential part of the base‘s operational risk management
  process to evaluate and determine the best courses of action. The Severe Weather Action
  Team (SWAT) provides supervision over severe weather events which aids in the evaluation
  of courses of action.
     2.8.1.1. The SWAT will consist of a team leader, additional team members, and either
     the Flight Chief or the Flight Commander, depending upon availability. The 17 OWS
     will contact the WF Flight Commander or Flight Chief if unable to contact the duty
     forecaster. Phone numbers will be maintained in 17 OWS Forecast Installation
     Procedures. The SWAT leader (as identified on the duty schedule) will be called in
     immediately by the WF forecaster, or 17 OWS forecaster if WF forecaster is unavailable,
     whenever any of the following severe weather conditions occur:
         2.8.1.1.1. 17 OWS or WF issues a Watch or Warning for:
             2.8.1.1.1.1. Tornado
             2.8.1.1.1.2. Severe Thunderstorms (Hail>1/2‖ and/or convective gust>45 kts)
             2.8.1.1.1.3. Moderate Thunderstorms (Hail<1/2‖ and/or convective gusts > 35kts
             but LT 45kts )
             2.8.1.1.1.4. Surface winds (> 45 knots)
             2.8.1.1.1.5. Heavy rainfall (> 2‖ in 12 hours) or snow accumulation (> 2‖ snow
             depth in 12 hours)
             2.8.1.1.1.6. Heavy rainfall (> 5‖ in 12 hours)
             2.8.1.1.1.7. Freezing precipitation
             2.8.1.1.1.8. Blizzard conditions
         2.8.1.1.2. The duty forecaster requires help during adverse weather regardless of
         what has or has not been issued as far as warnings, watches or advisories.
         2.8.1.1.3. Osan AB is placed in Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness (TCCOR)
         of 2 or 1.
  2.8.2. Upon arriving at the WF, the SWAT Leader will receive a briefing from the ASE
  forecaster, or 17 OWS installation forecaster if ASE forecaster is unavailable, to include
  what has been issued already, Meteorological Conference or Discussion (METCON) issues
  already discussed with the 17 OWS forecaster, and any other pertinent information. The
  SWAT Leader will then contact the 17 OWS forecaster responsible for Osan AB and discuss
  the situation with them. By communicating regularly and discussing information, the WF
  and 17 OWS will work together as a team to ensure the most effective protection for the
  installation and 51 FW assets.
  2.8.3. The SWAT Leader will respond ASAP to analyze and assess the weather threat. If the
  SWAT determines that the installation is at risk for severe weather, the SWAT Leader will
  call in additional personnel as required and available. The SWAT Leader will also
51FWI15-101 30 AUGUST 2012                                                                 13


  coordinate with the EOC at Bldg 1097 to present weather updates during typhoon season.
  The SWAT Leader will use sound ORM principles to mitigate threats to the installation.
  2.8.4. At TCCOR 3, the SWAT will go on standby. At TCCOR 2, the SWAT will activate
  and send a representative to the EOC as requested for real time weather updates for the 51
  FW/CC.
  2.8.5. The ASE forecaster will remain the lead SWAT forecaster and will assist the SWAT
  Leader as to the duties required.
  2.8.6. SWAT Duties:
     2.8.6.1. The ASE forecaster is the lead SWAT forecaster and will dictate how the shift
     will run. That person will determine who will monitor telephone calls and man the
     radar/satellite position. The ASE forecaster will be free to take observations and
     coordinate all watches and warnings. The ASE forecaster and 17 OWS will routinely
     conduct a conference call to discuss impending weather. The duty forecaster is the ―eyes
     forward‖ for the 17 OWS and communication is key to successful protection of base
     resources.
     2.8.6.2. The duty forecaster will hold a METCON when the SWAT Leader arrives to
     update the leader on the timing of impending weather. This ensures all SWAT members
     know the timing and severity of the weather expected to occur and will help to keep all
     briefings consistent with the forecast. The ASE forecaster will relay the same
     information to the MWE forecasters when they are on duty.
     2.8.6.3. The senior ranking SWAT member will interface with all senior leadership when
     weather updates are required.
     2.8.6.4. Operational Reporting (OPREP).
         2.8.6.4.1. The senior ranking SWAT member will help the Osan Command Center

      2.8.6.5. SWAT Exercises: The WF will complete and annotate, at least annually, a
      SWAT exercise to evaluate the timeliness of notification of personnel and response
      capabilities to severe weather events IAW AFI 10-229, paragraph 2.3.9. Real world
      SWAT implementation will fulfill the training requirement. Prior coordination with the
      17 OWS for a SWAT exercise is recommended (but not mandated) for both units to
      satisfy exercising SWAT procedures.
      2.8.6.6. The WF will provide 17 OWS severe weather reports not normally available
      through standard observations. These include reports from indigenous sources, local law
      enforcement, local news media, and unit personnel. These reports will be passed
      immediately after fulfilling any local distribution requirement (e.g. special or local
      weather observation). If this is not possible, then pass the reports ASAP so the 17 OWS
      can use reports in post-analysis and verification. Pass reports to the 17 OWS Osan
      Installation Forecaster at DSN 449-4127.
2.9. Runway Closure Support. Watches, warnings, and advisories will be issued for both Osan
AB and Suwon AB during periods when the Osan AB runway is closed for an extended period of

                                     OBSERVING SERVICES

3.1. Duty Hours and Contact Information. The Osan WF provides observing services 24
hours a day between 2200L Sunday to 2200L Friday or end of flying operations. There will be a
standby weather forecaster during the limited-duty hours of 2200L Friday to 2200L Sunday. The
weather observer for Osan can be reached at DSN 784-9370/8340. To reach the standby
forecaster during the limited duty hours, please contact the 17 OWS at DSN 449-7935.
3.2. Primary Observation Equipment. The AN/FMQ-19 Automated Meteorological Station
(AMS) will be the primary piece of equipment used to take weather observations at Osan AB.
From here on out the AN/FMQ-19 will be referred to simply as FMQ-19.
3.3. Augmentation of Primary Observation Equipment. There are two processes to augment
a weather observation: supplement and backup. Listed below is a summary for augmentation
procedures. For more specific details, please refer to AFMAN 15-111, Chapter 3.
    3.3.1. Weather technicians will supplement data from the FMQ-19 when the following
    criteria are met:
NOTE: Supplementation is the process of manually adding or editing data to an observation
generated by an automated surface weather observing system (i.e. FMQ-19) that is beyond that
system‘s capabilities. IAW AFMAN 15-111, the weather technician must maintain situational
awareness of current weather conditions and automated surface observations with the knowledge
that flight safety is their highest priority; therefore, they may supplement if flight safety is at risk
because of the system‘s limitations (see paragraph 3.6. for equipment limitations)
        3.3.1.1. Tornadic activity (i.e., tornados, funnel clouds, or waterspouts)
        3.3.1.2. Large hail (Hail≥1/2‖)
        3.3.1.3. Volcanic ash is observed from the airfield.
        3.3.1.4. Visibility, when < 1/4 statute mile (local security forces requirement)
        3.3.1.5. Sandstorms or dust storms
    3.3.2. The WF will back-up the FMQ-19 if the airfield is open, ATC is supporting flying ops
    and the system/sensor(s) is/are not operational or unavailable due to sensor and/or
    communication failure
        3.3.2.1. Weather technicians will backup (edit) the following functions of the FMQ-19:
NOTE: Backup (editing) is the process of manually providing meteorological data and/or
dissemination to an automated weather observation when the primary automated method is not
operational or unavailable due to sensor and/or communication failure.
            3.3.2.1.1. Wind speed and direction
            3.3.2.1.2. Visibility
            3.3.2.1.3. Selected present weather elements and obscurations (see Table 3.1.)

              contractions Cumulonimbus Cloud (CB) for cumulonimbus clouds or TCU for
              towering cumulus clouds to be attached to the appropriate height, (e.g., BKN050
              can be augmented to report BKN050CB).

       3.3.2.2. In the interest of flight safety, when the ceiling is below 3,000 feet and/or
       visibility is below 3 statute miles, weather technicians will frequently verify the
       performance of the FMQ-19 and backup as necessary using manual observing
       procedures. The sensor in question will be logged out. When flight safety is an issue,
       back-up procedures will be implemented first and then the sensor will be logged out.
       ATC is contacted immediately following an equipment outage.

NOTES:

1. Back-up RVRNO Sensor Status and Maintenance Indicator ($) remarks if not provided by the
FMQ-19. There is no back-up required for VISNO (LOC) and CHINO (LOC) remarks if not
provided by system.
2. All Remarks and Additive Data references are provided in AFMAN 15-111, Attachment 3.
    3.3.3. Observations for special criteria will be taken when the FMQ-19 is not capable.
    3.3.4. The weather technician will augment all the applicable weather conditions in AFMAN
    15-111, Tables A2.1. and A3.1.
3.4. Augmentation Observation Site. For augmentation of the FMQ-19, the official point of
observation on Osan AB is the marked area approximately 50 ft north of Bldg 882 on the
Airfield Management Operations (AMOPS) Ramp.
3.5. Augmentation Observation Site Limitations. The following limitations affect surface
observation quality at the manual observation site.
    3.5.1. Hills and buildings obscure the horizon from the southeast through the southwest
    quadrants.
3.6. Equipment Limitations. As with any automated system, the FMQ-19 has the following
inherent limitations:
    3.6.1. Cloud height and coverage are determined by a laser beam ceilometer, which looks at
    a small portion of the atmosphere directly above the sensor. Using a time averaging
    algorithm, it calculates a representative sky condition for the entire celestial dome from the
 18                                                            51FWI15-101 30 AUGUST 2012


   sample of the atmosphere that the sensor reports. The FMQ-19 measures cloud heights
   between 100 and 25,000 feet.
   3.6.2. Visibility is determined at the sensor location, so it may not always be representative
   of the entire airfield. The FMQ-19 cannot report visibility less than 1/4 statute miles.
   3.6.3. The FMQ-19 may not detect all thunderstorm and lightning activity and it cannot
   detect hail, virga, volcanic ash, cloud types, or tornadic activity to include tornadoes, funnel
   clouds, and waterspouts.
   3.6.4. The FMQ-19 may be slow to report accurate sky conditions, visibility, and present
   weather during periods of rapidly changing weather conditions due to the time it takes to
   process its algorithms.
3.7. Basic Weather Watch (BWW)/Cooperative Weather Watch.
   3.7.1. The weather station conducts a BWW when augmenting the FMQ-19; otherwise the
   FMQ-19 has the capability to conduct a Continuous Weather Watch (CWW)which
   eliminates the need to conduct a BWW. In addition to taking and disseminating required
   observations, the BWW requires weather conditions be checked no longer than 20 minutes
   since the last observation to determine the need for a special Aviation Selected Special
   Weather Report (SPECI) observation. Refer to Attachment 3 for specific criteria for SPECI
   observations.
   3.7.2. SPECI observation. A SPECI observation is taken when observed weather criteria
   pass through significant weather thresholds established by AFMAN 15-111 and 51 FW needs
   (refer to Attachment 3). SPECI is disseminated worldwide through the Air Force Weather
   Agency (AFWA), Offutt AFB, Omaha, Nebraska.
   3.7.3. Due to limited visibility to the southeast through southwest, a cooperative weather
   watch will be conducted with ATC Tower personnel to ensure accurate observation of
   conditions that could affect flight safety or local resources.
       3.7.3.1. The Noncommissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC), ASE will train air traffic
       controllers in cooperative weather watch observation techniques. Controllers will be
       trained on reporting tower sector visibility and prevailing visibility when tower visibility
       is less than 4 statute miles (6,000 meters) and different from the surface prevailing
       visibility as well as identifying significant weather events. After completion of training,
       controllers must score at least 70% on a multiple choice test to be granted a limited
       weather observer certification. Results will be recorded on the controller‘s AF Form
       3622, Air Traffic Control/Weather Certification and Rating Record (LRA), and signed off
       by the weather examiner AFI 13-204V3, Air Traffic Control, paragraph 7.5.3.
   3.7.4. When the duty weather technician receives weather reports from ATC personnel,
   pilots, security forces personnel, or any other reliable source., which differ from the last
   disseminated observation, the duty weather technician will evaluate the weather condition
   reports and determine if an immediate augmentation is necessary.
3.8. Dissemination of Observations. Since airfield observations are primarily focused on the
needs of the flying community, the WF uses FMQ-19 or JET as the primary dissemination tool
for observations. If the FMQ-19 or JET is inoperative, observers will first disseminate
observations, by phone, to positions that control local air traffic: ATC Tower, Radar Approach
51FWI15-101 30 AUGUST 2012                                                               19


Control (RAPCON), and the SOF. After positions that control local air traffic have been
notified, observations will be transmitted longline through the Joint Army Air Force Weather
Information Network (JAAWIN) via the internet or by phone notification to the 17 OWS for
dissemination through JAAWIN or JET. Elements of the current observation are also
automatically posted to the Osan Weather Channel, cable channel 12.

               WEATHER WATCHES, WARNINGS, AND ADVISORIES

4.1. Weather Watches and Warnings: General Information. Watches and Warnings are
issued for Osan AB to protect vital base resources from hazardous conditions and to provide
maximum flight safety. The 17 OWS issues all forecast weather watches and warnings. Osan
AB weather station personnel are responsible for ensuring weather watches and warnings are
disseminated in a timely manner. During operations at Suwon AB when the Osan AB runway is
closed, weather watches and warnings will be issued for both Osan AB and Suwon AB. Each
watch and warning is assigned a number following the two-digit number of the current month
(e.g. 06-001 would be the first watch/warning issued in June). Only one Watch or Warning will
be in effect at one time for Osan AB, excluding the lightning watch/warning.
   4.1.1. Weather Watch. Weather watch is a special notice provided to supported agencies
   alerting them of the potential for weather conditions of intensity to pose a hazard to life or
   property. The weather watch can be thought of as a ―heads up‖ that agencies need to
   consider making plans to take required protective actions should an actual WW be issued
   later. All watches are issued within 5 NM of Osan AB based on the criteria listed below in
   paragraph 4.2. Desired lead-time (DLT) is 4 hours or as potential warrants for severe
   weather watches as defined in paragraph 4.2., with the exception of the lightning watch. The
   DLT for the lightning watch is 30 minutes prior to observed lightning.
   4.1.2. Weather Warning. Weather Warning (WW) is a special notice provided to supported
   agencies giving them advance notification of weather conditions of intensity to pose a hazard
   to life or property and expected to directly affect a designated geographical area. Warnings
   will be issued when any of the specified warning criteria listed in paragraph 4.3. are expected
   to occur within 5 NM of Osan AB.
   4.1.3. DLT. (Desired Lead Time) is the amount of advance notice an agency requires prior to
   the onset of a particular weather phenomenon in order to take protective actions. The Local
   Area Network (LAN), listed below are per AFMAN 15-129V1 and Osan AB customer
   requirements. The only warning issued without a DLT is lightning. The Osan duty observer
   will issue this warning when lightning is observed or detected within 5 NM.

Note 2. All forecast warnings for Osan AB will be issued by the 17 OWS unless the WF
determines the threat is imminent and poses a threat to life or property. In this case, the WF will
issue the forecast warning and back brief the 17 OWS ASAP.
Note 3.
Blizzard Condition (per AFMAN 15-129V1, Table 4.1.) is defined as: duration of > 3 hours,
sustained winds or gusts > 30 knots, considerable falling and/or blowing snow, with surface
visibility frequently < 1/4 statute mile/0400 meters (all criteria must be met).

4.2. Dissemination of Watches and Warnings.
   4.2.1. JET is the primary dissemination system for all watches, warnings, and advisories.
   JET can be accessed by any computer on the LAN, by logging into the JET Portal via the
   following link: https://osjet01.osan.af.mil/jetspeed/portal/. Agencies must supply their
   own computer to access the JET terminal via an Internet Browser. If agencies are
   experiencing any issues with the JET Interface, please call the ASE forecaster counter
   immediately at 784-9370/8340. See Attachment 4 for a list of agencies that have access to
   the JET Portal.
   4.2.2. Agencies requiring notification, but not possessing a JET Account must coordinate
   with 51 OSS/OSW to establish an account.
   4.2.3. The WF will use the Osan Weather Channel, cable channel 12, to keep the base
   populace informed of all applicable watches and warnings. As required, command and
   control instructions pertaining to weather watches and warnings will be posted on the
   Commander‘s Access Channel, cable channel 13, via 51 FW/OC.
51FWI15-101 30 AUGUST 2012                                                                      23


   4.2.4. Time permitting, the 17 OWS will call the WF forecaster or Stand-by forecaster prior
   to issuing/extending/canceling a weather watch, warning, or advisory.
4.3. Weather Advisory (WA): General Information. A WA is a special notice provided to
supported agencies giving them notification of mission-limiting, non severe weather conditions
expected to directly affect a designated geographical area. The 17 OWS will issue all forecast
advisories. Observed WAs will be issued by the ASE duty forecaster. An advisory will be
issued when any of the specified advisory criteria listed in Table 4.3. is expected to occur within
5 NM of Osan AB. During Osan AB runway closure operations at Suwon AB, weather
advisories will be issued for both Osan AB and Suwon AB. Each advisory will be assigned a
number following the two-digit number of the current month (i.e. 06-001 would be the first
advisory of June).

                   DISSEMINATION OF WEATHER INFORMATION

7.1. General Information. Assured communications are crucial to the dissemination of
weather information throughout the base. It is incumbent on all weather personnel to ensure
dissemination through timely and proper notifications. Proper situational awareness is
paramount in ensuring the right people are warned of given weather conditions.
7.2. JET. JET is the primary dissemination method used by the WF. JET will display current
observations, forecasts, and watches, warnings, and advisories. Alerts will be sent out to all
users who possess access to the JET Portal.
7.3. Weather Intranet Webpage. The WF maintains a set of WebPages on the intranet. The
location may change without notice due to 51 CS requirements.
7.4. Osan Weather Channel. The Osan Weather Channel is channel 12 on the Osan cable
television system. Current satellite and radar imagery, observations, 5-day forecasts, and
climatology are routinely available. During a severe weather event, additional information
concerning weather notices will be posted, including start and end times. Command and control
instructions pertaining to a given weather event may be found on channel 13, Commander‘s
Access Channel.
7.5. Dissemination of Watches, Warnings, and Advisories. The WF will utilize procedures in
Attachment 4, Table A4.2. for primary dissemination of weather watches, warnings, and
advisories to customers requiring notification (listed in Table A4.1. in Attachment 4). For
backup notification procedures, see Attachment 4, Table A4.3. Additional units may be added to
Table A4.1. through coordination with WF. The Osan Weather Channel is used to communicate
weather watches, warnings, and advisories for all other personnel on base.
7.6. Non-availability
   7.6.1. If the airfield is closed, the observation information provided through the JET Portal
   can be used as the official observation.
       7.6.1.1. If the JET Portal is down and the observations are not being disseminated
       correctly, the standby forecaster will be notified by the OWS IAW the procedures on the
       weekly standby letter.
   7.6.2. When deployed, the WF will coordinate with the 51 LRS to transport the Tactical
   Meteorological Equipment, TMQ-53. It will be determined if a KQ Identifier is needed at
   the deployed location. The KQ Identifier will then be disseminated to the OWS, where they
   will be able to view the observation information via JAAWIN and Air Force Weather Web
   Services (AFWWEBS).
   7.6.3. When the WF is evacuated to the Alternate Observing Location (AOL), the WF will
   contact the OWS notifying them of the evacuation. The WF will transmit an observation
   within 15 minutes of arriving at the AOL, if the FMQ-19 is deemed inoperable.

                              TROPICAL STORM SUPPORT

8.1. General Information. The WF will closely monitor all tropical storms, which may
threaten the ROK (and/or be within 300 miles of the peninsula within 72 hours) and will keep 51
FW/CC and designated key personnel informed of the likely effects of the storm. The tropical
weather information will be emailed to 51 FW/CC and designated key personnel. Specific
support procedures will be IAW PACAFI 15-101, Weather Support for PACAF, and
USCINCPACINST 3140.1X, Tropical Cyclone Operations Manual.
   8.1.1. The WF uses tropical cyclone forecasts issued by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center
   (JTWC). No deviation from the official forecast position, track, movement, maximum wind
   speed, or intensity trend is authorized, IAW AFMAN 15-129V2.
   8.1.2. The WF will tailor official tropical cyclone forecasts for the AMEF, MEF, and other
   forecast products using a locally defined MEF process. Tailoring may include factors such
   as specific local effects such as terrain or relative position to the storm. A tropical update
   briefing is published at 0100, 0900, and 1500L when any Tropical Cyclone lies within
   Latitude 10N-50N and Longitude 160E-105W, as outlined in SOP A5.1.
   8.1.3. 48-hour and 72-hour outlooks (or longer if issued) contain a high degree of
   uncertainty, are for planning purposes only, and are subject to change.
   8.1.4. Tropical Cyclone Threat Assessment Product (TC-TAP). TC-TAP is produced by

                      BACKUP AND EVACUATION OPERATIONS

10.1. General Information. In the event of communication outages or primary work center
evacuation, WF will continue to provide tailored weather support to Osan AB agencies as
outlined in this plan and IAW AFMAN 15-111 and both AFMAN 15-129V1 and AFMAN 15-
129V2.
10.2. Communication Outages. The WF utilizes JET as the primary dissemination tool for
observations, TAFs, WWAs, and 175-1s. If the JET server is down, observers will first
disseminate observations to positions that control local air traffic: ATC Tower, RAPCON, and
the SOF. After positions that control local air traffic have been notified, observations will be
transmitted longline through the JAAWIN. The current observation is also automatically posted
to the Osan Weather Channel, cable channel 12, via the LAN.
   10.2.1. Backup Dissemination of watches, warnings, and advisories. During total JET
   outages, the WF will utilize backup procedures in Attachment 4, Table A4.3. to disseminate
   weather watches, warnings, and advisories to customers requiring notification (listed in
   Attachment 4, Table A4.1.). The Osan Weather Channel is used to communicate weather
   watches, warnings, and advisories for all other personnel on base.
10.3. Power Outages. In the event of primary power loss to Building 882, a power generator
located in Building 883 will provide backup power to the building. The Primary Building
Custodian for Building 882 will interface with 51 CES/CEO.
   10.3.1. In case of catastrophic power outages (backup power is unavailable), the WF will
   relocate to the AOL.
10.4. AOLs.
   10.4.1. In the event Building 882 must be evacuated, the following locations (shown with
   telephone contact numbers), in order of priority, are the alternate observing locations:
       10.4.1.1. White trailer at the base of the tower (DSN 784-0096).
       10.4.1.2. Any other facility or location deemed suitable for observing purposes.
   10.4.2. Alternate observing locations observations will comply with established procedures
   in AFMAN 15-129V2 and AFMAN 15-111 and the WF SOP's.
   10.4.3. The following limitations affect surface observation quality at the base of the tower.
       10.4.3.1. Hills and buildings obscure the horizon from the southeast through the
       southwest quadrants.
10.5. Services Provided. All forecasting and observing services (outlined in Chapters 2 and 3)

Airfield Services Element (ASE)—This element expands the traditional observing function at
the airfield by infusing the elements of the METWATCH and resource protection roles. The
ASE will function as the ―eyes forward‖ for the 17 OWS and in many cases will serve as the
primary point of contact for the collaborative forecast effort to include resource protection for an
installation. The ASE also interfaces with the SOF.
Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA)—AFWA is a field operating agency responsible for all
meteorological services for the Air Force. It includes a strategic weather center at Offutt AFB
NE, providing strategic atmospheric data and strategic analysis/forecast products required by the
regional Operational Weather Squadrons and the WFs worldwide. AFWA provides the
centralized repository for global observations and forecasts that are archived at AFWA and, in
turn, disseminated to DoD weather data users worldwide. In addition to global observations and
forecasts collected from worldwide sources, AFWA collects meteorological satellite data from
multiple sources. Based on global analysis of available data, AFWA creates global analysis and
forecast products to meet the strategic forecast requirements of its customers.
Backup—An augmentation process of manually providing meteorological data and/or
dissemination to an automated weather observation when the primary automated method is not
operational or unavailable due to sensor and/or communication failure.
Desired Lead—Time—The amount of advance notice a supported agency desires before the
onset of a particular weather phenomenon.

Eyes Forward—WF forecasters are the "eyes forward" for the forecasters in the 17 OWS and
integrate weather radar data, meteorological satellite imagery, lightning detection readouts, and
non-standard weather data systems (vertical profilers, mesonet data, etc.) to create an integrated
weather picture and near-term trend forecasts for the OWS. "Eyes forward" yields meaningful
meteorological information not contained in coded observations to the servicing OWS and is an
integral part of the METWATCH for an installation or contingency operating location.
Issue Time—The time when an agency is notified of a watch, warning, or advisory. When more
than one agency is notified, the issue time is the time the last agency is notified. Follow-up
notifications are not considered when determining issue time.
METAR (Aviation Routine Weather Reports)—METAR is a routine scheduled observation as
well as the primary observation code used by the United States to satisfy requirements for
reporting surface meteorological data. METAR contains a report of wind, visibility, runway
visual range, present weather and obscurations, sky condition, temperature, dew point, and
altimeter setting. In addition, coded and/or plain language information may be appended to the
METAR.
METWATCH (Meteorological Watch)—Monitoring aerospace weather for a route, area, or
terminal and advising concerned organizations when phenomena that could effect their
operations or pose a hazard to life or property are observed or about to occur.
Mission Execution Forecast (MEF)—A MEF is a customized weather product providing
terrestrial and space weather data and forecasts for a specific mission, or set of missions. It fully
integrates aerospace weather with the customer‘s tactics, weapon systems, environmental

provide an automated weather support and communications capability to the WF. This system
was replaced with Joint Environmental Toolkit in 2011.
Notice to Airmen—A notice containing information concerning the establishment, condition, or
change in any aeronautical facility, service, procedures, or hazard, the timely knowledge of
which is essential to personnel concerned with flight operations.
Operational Weather Squadron (OWS)—An organization comprised of management,
technician, and training personnel responsible for providing regional weather support. Their
mission is to produce operational-level weather forecast products and services to customers
within their AOR. The 17th Operational Weather Squadron serves as the OWS for the Korean
Theater of Operations.

added to an automated weather observation that is beyond the capabilities of the FMQ-19 to
detect and/or report.

Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF)—A weather forecast for a certain aerodrome, limited to
within 5 NM of the airfield. The format is highly structured IAW AFMAN 15-124.
Weather Advisory (WA)—A special notice provided to a supported agency when an
established weather condition that could effect its operation is occurring or is expected to occur.
Weather Flight (WF)—An umbrella term covering any military weather organization providing
direct operational support at the tactical level. In addition to designated weather units, (OSS
WFs, Weather Detachments and Squadrons, ANG WFs) specialized sections in an OWS (flight
weather briefing or contingency cell) and AFWA (Special Support Operations Branch) also
operate as WFs.
Weather Warning (WW)—A special notice provided to a supported agency when an
established weather condition of such intensity as to effect operations, pose a hazard to life or

                            SPECIAL OBSERVATION CRITERIA

A3.1. General: When augmentation is required, weather technicians will perform a BWW.
During a BWW, the weather observer will recheck weather conditions, at intervals not to exceed
20 minutes since the last observation/recheck, to determine the need for a special (SPECI)
observation when any of the following conditions are occurring or are forecast to occur in the
next hour:
   A3.1.1. Ceiling forms below or decreases to less than 1,500 feet.
   A3.1.2. Ceiling dissipates, or increases to equal or exceed 1,500 feet.
   A3.1.3. Visibility decreases to less than 3 miles (4,800 meters).
   A3.1.4. Visibility increases to equal or exceed 3 miles (4,800 meters).
   A3.1.5. Precipitation.
   A3.1.6. Thunderstorms.
   A3.1.7. Fog.
   A3.1.8. Weather technicians will remain alert for any other changes in weather conditions
   that will require a SPECI observation. Weather technicians will also monitor local area
   observational and forecast products as often as necessary to keep abreast of changes expected
   to affect their AOR.
A3.2. SPECI Criteria. SPECI weather observation criteria are given below.
   A3.2.1. SPECI weather observations will be taken for the following conditions:
       A3.2.1.1. SPECI observations will be disseminated and recorded when the ceiling or
       visibility is observed to form or dissipate below, decrease to less than, or if below to
       increase to equal or exceed the following criteria.
 58                                                            51FWI15-101 30 AUGUST 2012


Table A3.1. SPECI Criteria.




NOTE: FLIP = Flight Information Pamphlet
A3.2.1.2. A layer of clouds or obscuring phenomena aloft is observed below 1,000 feet and no
layer aloft was reported below 1,000 feet in the previous METAR or SPECI observation.
   A3.2.2. Tornado(s), waterspout(s), or funnel cloud(s) will be reported in a SPECI whenever
   they are observed to begin (or first seen), moves or disappears from sight, or ends.
       A3.2.2.1. The ASE will transmit a single element SPECI (locally and longline) for
       tornadic activity and/or volcanic (ash) eruptions.
   A3.2.3. Thunderstorms:
       A3.2.3.1. Begins (A SPECI is not required to report the beginning of a new thunderstorm
       if one is currently being reported. For reporting purposes, a thunderstorm is considered
       to have begun (and occurring) ―at the station‖ when thunder is first heard or detected by
       the FMQ-19 lightning sensor. It may also be considered as occurring when hail is falling
       or lightning is observed or detected in the immediate vicinity of the airfield and the local
       noise level is such that resulting thunder cannot be heard.)
       A3.2.3.2. Ends (15 minutes after last occurrence of thunder).
   A3.2.4. Precipitation:
       A3.2.4.1. Hail begins or ends.
       A3.2.4.2. Freezing precipitation begins, ends, or changes in intensity.
       A3.2.4.3. Any other type of precipitation begins or ends.
NOTE: Except for freezing rain, freezing drizzle, and hail, a SPECI is not required for changes
in type (e.g., drizzle changing to snow grains) or the beginning or ending of one type while
another is in progress (e.g., snow changing to rain and snow).
   A3.2.5. Squall (a strong wind characterized by a sudden onset in which the wind speed
   increases at least 16 knots and is sustained at 22 knots or more for at least one minute).
51FWI15-101 30 AUGUST 2012                                                                  59


   A3.2.6. Wind shifts (changes by 45 degrees or more in less than 15 minutes with sustained
   winds (or gust) of 10 knots or more throughout the wind shift).
   A3.2.7. RVR for the active runway is observed to decrease to less than or, if below, to
   increase to equal or exceed the following criteria:

Table A3.2. RVR Special Criteria




      A3.2.7.1. Report RVR when prevailing visibility is first observed to be < 1SM (1,600
      meters) and again when prevailing visibility goes above 1SM (1,600 meters).
   A3.2.8. When RVR is first determined as unavailable for the active runway, report RVRNO
   (runway visual range not operating), and report RVRNO when it is first determined that the
   RVRNO report is no longer applicable, provided conditions for reporting RVR still exist.
   A3.2.9. Upon notification of an aircraft mishap, the WF will collect and save data IAW
   AFMAN 15-129V2 and AFI 15-128. Because the FMQ-19 automatically prepares and
   archives an observation every minute, the WF is not required to include an aircraft mishap
   remark in the observation. There are no special archive requirements at the WFs with a
   FMQ-19. Dissemination is not required unless FMQ-19 has generated a pending METAR or
   SPECI observation.
   A3.2.10. Miscellaneous:
      A3.2.10.1. Volcanic eruption when first observed.
          A3.2.10.1.1. Report name of volcano, latitude and longitude or direction and distance
          from unit, date/time (UTC) of eruption, size description, approximate height and
          direction of movement of the ash cloud and any other pertinent data.
   A3.2.11. SPECI upon resumption of observing services is not required when in automated
   mode. If not in automated mode, then take, disseminate, and record a SPECI within 15
   minutes after returning to duty following a break in hourly coverage if a METAR was not
   filed as scheduled during that 15 minute period.
A3.3. Supplement Special Criteria. The mandatory supplementary elements that the WF will
report in the body of a SPECI and/or remarks:
   A3.3.1. Supplementing Visibility. When visibility is < 1/4 statute mile.
   A3.3.2. Supplementing Tornadic Activity (+FC/FC): The beginning or ending of a
   tornado(s), waterspout(s), or funnel cloud(s) will be reported in a SPECI.
   A3.3.3. Supplementing Hail (GR). Hail will be reported in a SPECI whenever it begins or
   ends. When hail is supplemented into the body of the report, a remark should be included to
60                                                          51FWI15-101 30 AUGUST 2012


  report the beginning or ending time. In addition, the weather technician should report the
  hailstone size in remarks when hailstones 1/4" or larger in diameter occur. No intensity is
  assigned to hail.
  A3.3.4. Supplementing Volcanic Ash (VA). Volcanic Ash will be reported whenever it is
  observed falling to the ground at the unit. VA is always encoded in the body of the report,
  regardless of the visibility and no remarks are required. No intensity is assigned to volcanic
  ash.
51FWI15-101 30 AUGUST 2012                                                                                           61

                               HEAT STRESS GUIDELINES

A5.1. Heat Stress
    A5.1.1. The wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) is the most useful heat stress index for
    measuring the effect of the environment on individuals. It takes the ambient temperature and
    factors in relative humidity and heat from the sun. 51 AMDS BEE determines the WBGT,
    heat/flag category, and issues heat stress advisories/warnings. The following tables are
    extracted from AFPAM 48-151, Thermal Injury, Attachment 5:

activity. Unacclimatized personnel should not be allowed to perform hard work. If mission
requirements do not allow for suspension, supervisors should carefully observe personnel and
ensure minimum water intake as listed above.

                    FIGHTER INDEX OF THERMAL STRESS (FITS)

A6.1. FITS
   A6.1.1. This index describes the impact a high temperature and dew point temperature will
   have on aircrews. Prior to flight, aircrews limit their ground operations based on the FITS
   zone. The three zones are normal, caution, and danger. An advisory will be issued by the
   WF when in FITS caution or danger.
   A6.1.2. To use the table below, follow the current temperature on the left side of the chart
   until it intersects with the dew point temperature listed at the top of the chart. If the
   intersection point is in the white/green zone, then FITS is ―Normal.‖ If the intersection is in
   the medium grey/yellow zone, then FITS is ―Caution.‖ If the intersection is in the dark
   grey/red zone, then FITS is ―Danger.‖ (The "X" denotes combinations above saturation
   temperature.) The following tables are extracted from AFPAM 48-151, Thermal Injury,

         A6.1.2.2.1. Minimum recovery time between flights is 2 hours (landing time to next
         takeoff time), unless hot refueling.
         A6.1.2.2.2. Limit total ground operations to 45 minutes for fighter aircraft (time
         outside an air-conditioned environment). If exceeded, minimum recovery time is 1
         hour.
         A6.1.2.2.3. Complete a maximum of two aircraft inspections (two exterior
         inspections on initial sorties and one exterior inspection on subsequent sorties).

                                      COLD STRESS

A7.1. Cold Stress
   A7.1.1. Wind Chill is used to describe the lowering of relative temperature due to wind
   speed. Cold injury prevention relies upon minimizing exposure and reducing heat loss by the
   use of proper clothing. Operations in cold regions of the world expose personnel to the
   hazards of cold stress and consequent risk of hypothermia.
   A7.1.2. In accordance with paragraph 3.4. of AFPAM 48-151, Bioenvironmental
   Engineering (BEE) personnel are responsible for the determination of the Wind Chill Index
   zones of risk and determining which colored flags or boards are recommended for display on
   base in order to minimize the risk of cold injury to personnel.
