This manual implements AFPD 10-4, Operations Planning. It provides guidance on Air Force-unique planning aspects not
addressed in Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES) documents and complements JOPES guidance for
Air Force planners at all levels. It is not intended to replace or supersede joint guidance published in JOPES documents. If
there is a conflict between this manual and joint guidance, comply with joint guidance and notify HQ USAF/XOO of the
conflict. HQ USAF/XOO will resolve the conflict and publish new guidance, if required. If there is a conflict between this
manual and guidance from the supported command, the Air Force component command staffs must attempt to resolve the
conflict with the supported command staff. In questions of plan format, Air Force planners are expected to conform to the
supported unified command format. When time permits, conflicts should be reported to HQ USAF/XOO for resolution.
Users of this manual should familiarize themselves with the referenced Department of Defense (DOD) guidance. Send
comments and recommendations for changes to this manual on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication,
through channels, to HQ USAF/XOOW, 1480 Air Force Pentagon, Washington, DC 20330-1480.

                                       FORMAT AND CONTENT OF OPLANS

C1. Purpose. This enclosure provides specific guidance for the format and general content of OPLANs.

C2. Format and Content. JOPES, Volume II, specifies the format for unified and specified command plans tasked by the
JSCP. The format in this enclosure was derived from the JOPES format and contains the Air Force unique planning
information needed in addition to the basic joint planning format. Air Force supporting command plans will adhere to the
basic format used by the unified command it supports, since JOPES may change out of cycle with this publication. This is a
sample which illustrates each element of an OPLAN (annex, appendix, tab, and exhibit) and the letter of transmittal and
other administrative details used to prepare and transmit the OPLANs. A supplement may be used to augment an operation
plan or order of a higher headquarters, but not to modify, change, or nullify any policy, procedure, or instruction in the
basic document.

6.      ( ) TIME TO COMMENCE EFFECTIVE OPERATIONS. In a table, show the time-phased, incremental buildup
of combat forces in the objective area. Show clearly which combat forces must be available in the area of operations before
effective operations can commence. Also, show the elapsed time following an order to implement the plan, when each
significant level of combat force that the plan requires could begin effective operations in the objective area. Base the
listing on the lowest level of force (defined as the smallest force increment which could initiate effective operations). List
successively higher force levels, up to the maximum level called for in the basic plan. List any assumptions applied in
preparing this table which are not specified in the plan. Consider forces to be deployed or employed to be at normal
conditions of readiness when determining time to commence effective operations. For example, assume no advance
preparations except deception and other measures permitted by JSCP. Consider these additional factors and others which
pertain to the specific plan:

       a. ( )     Time required to carry out PSYOP and deception measures as specified in the relevant PSYOP and
deception plan.

       b    ()    Time for preparing and transmitting necessary orders.

could have a direct and significant influence on the operations encompassed by this plan.

             (3) ( )   List the specific tasks of friendly forces, commands, or governmental agencies which will directly
support this plan.

       e.   ()    Assumptions. List the assumptions on which the plan is based.


                                                                        CLASSIFIED BY:

             (1) ( ) List either the conditions most likely to exist, or other conditions over which the commanders have
no control, that are likely to have a significant impact on this plan or supporting plans.

            (2) ( ) List only assumptions which are directly relevant to the development of this plan and supporting
plans, and which express conditions that (should they not occur as expected) would invalidate the entire OPLAN or its
concept of operations.

each level of mobilization.

            (4) ( )    Include any additional assumptions about specific aspects of the operation in respective annexes.

       f.   ()    Legal Considerations. List those legal considerations on which the plan is based.

2      ( ) MISSION. State concisely the task and purpose to be accomplished on execution. This statement should
answer the questions: who, what, when, where, why, and sometimes how. Use the mission of the commander originating
the plan; or the task assigned by the CJCS; or the mission deduced from the Commander’s Estimate based on a task
assigned by the CJCS. If the plan is a supporting plan, indicate the plan that it supports.

3.     ()   EXECUTION.

       a. ( ) Concept of Operations. Preferably, include the entire concept of operations in the basic plan. (Optionally,
because some OPLANs necessarily cover alternative courses of action for carrying out the mission, and others require
considerable detail to convey adequate guidance for the development of supporting plans, the entire concept may be placed
in Annex C.)

            (1) ( ) Commander’s Intent. Describe the commander’s overall intent, and intent by phase. Describe the
desired end state. It should be a concise expression of the purpose of each phase of the operation. It may include how the
posture of units at that end state facilitates transition to future operations. It may also include the commander’s assessment
of the enemy commander’s intent. The commander’s intent is not, however, a summary of the concept of operations.


             (2) ( ) General. Indicate that the concept of operations is derived from the Commander's Estimate of the
situation. State in the concept how the commander intends to carry out the mission. Outline this information in the
concept:

                  (a) ( ) Tell which forces are involved, the time phasing of operations, the general nature and purpose
of operations to be conducted, and the interrelated or cross-service support, coordination, and cooperation necessary to
execute the operations successfully..

               (b) ( ) Include an estimate of the level and duration of conflict to provide supporting subordinate
commanders a basis for preparing adequate supporting plans.

                 (c)   ()   To the extent possible, the plan should incorporate the following concepts of joint operation
planning doctrine:

                       1. Commander’s strategic intent and operational focus.

                       2. Orientation on the strategic and operational centers of gravity of the threat.

                       3. Protection of friendly strategic and operational centers of gravity.

A graphic timeline may be used to assist in describing the various options or phases covered in the concept to include items
such as warning and response times, major deployments, and employment phases. The concept should show how the
initiative will be gained, security against enemy actions will be maintained, and superiority and surprise will be achieved..
If appropriate, reference should be made to Annex A for detailed force requirements. Additionally, if commanders
anticipate sustained armed conflict during execution of the plan, the CONOPS should outline the synchronized employment
of air, land, maritime, space, special operations, PSYOP, and C2W operations in a joint campaign. Acknowledging that
details of campaigns cannot be determined before armed conflict, provide sufficient detail to guide force structure,
organization, and development, and the planning and conduct of preconflict operations.

            (3) ( ) OPLAN Structure. For plans addressing situations that could involve armed conflict, the concept of
operations will include a separate description for each phase of the operation. These phases should include, as applicable,
the following:

                 (a)   ()   Conventional

                            1. Prehostilities

                            2. Lodgment

                            3. Decisive combat and stabilization

                            4. Follow Through

                            5. Posthostilities and Redeployment


                 (b)   ()   Nuclear

                            1. Pre-Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP)

                            2. Trans-SIOP

                            3. Post-SIOP




                                                              3

             (4) ( ) Deployment. Summarize the requirements to deploy forces from their normal peacetime locations to
the area of operations. Include:

                  (a) ( ) Deployments carried out within the command area, as well as deployments of augmentation
forces, and especially anticipatory deployments that may be required to implement and support the plan when directed.

                 (b)   ()   Deployment of rapid reaction forces as a partial implementation of the plan.

                 (c)   ()   Any deception measures needed to provide security, by misleading the enemy and achieving
surprise.

                 (d) ( )    A graphic timeline may be used to assist in describing the various options and phases covered.

            (5) ( ) Employment. Describe how the deployed forces are to be tactically employed in each of the phases
contained in OPLAN structure listed above to include the commander’s intent for each phase. Clearly outline plans for
using nuclear and chemical munitions or agents, if any. Refer to respective appendices of Annex C for: plans for
conducting US Air Force Special Operations; tactical electronic warfare operations; deception operations, PSYOP, SAR,
reconnaissance, and nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) defense operations.

        b. ( ) Tasks. List each task assigned to each element of the command in separate subparagraphs. List each task
as a concise statement of a mission to be performed, either in further planning for the operation or in executing the
Operations Order. Ensure that task assignments include all of the actions the subordinate elements must perform in order
to fulfill the concept of operations.

       c. ( ) Coordinating Instructions. In the final subparagraph, list the instructions applying to two or more
elements of the command that are necessary to coordinate the operation but do not belong in any specific annex. Explain
any terms that relate to the timing of execution and deployments. Also explain other operational terms that appear in the
plan and are not defined elsewhere in the plan or in joint publications.

NOTE: ( ) As a minimum, list all major elements directly subordinate to the headquarters originating the plan. List (and
designate as "support") each organization that directly supports the operation, even though it is not under the operational
command of the component commander. In addition, list each organization to be established specifically to implement the
plan, such as provisional units. The level of detail set forth should be only what is necessary to convey a clear
understanding of the significant forces to be committed to the operations.

NOTES:

(1) ULN--The unit line number uniquely identifies a force requirement. It is made up of:

        (a)      FRN--The force requirement number alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies a force requirement in a plan.

        (b)      FRAG--The fragmentation code is an alpha designator for a subordinate unit, fragmentation, or increment of the requested force.

        (c)      INS--The insert codes is an alphanumeric designator for inserting subordinate units, fragmentation, or increments used to retain original
                     fragmentations of forces when a planned movement requires additional subdivision.

(2)     UNIT TYPE CODE--The UTC is an alphanumeric code from the TUCHA file for the type unit described. If not listed in TUCHA, this may be a
nonstandard code.

(3)     SERV--The parent service code of the force requirement.

(4) DESCRIPTION--The short type name of the force requirement.

(5) PERS--The authorized personnel strength associated with the UTC.

(6) ULC--The unit level code associated with the UTC.

(7) SOURCE--The agency designated to provide the force requirement.

(8) ORIGIN--For planning purposes, this is the station at which the unit is located (in-place) or will most likely become available for deployment.

(9) PORT OF DEBARKATION OR OCEAN AREA-Consists of:

   (a)   MODE--The code for the preferred mode of transportation to the POD or ocean area.

   (b)   LOCATION NAME--The name of the geographic location of the POD or ocean area, or the term "IN-PLACE" for in-place units.

   (c)   CNTRY--The country or state name associated with the location name.

   (d)   LAD--The latest arrival date by which the force must complete unloading at the POD or ocean area.

   (e)   PRI--The desired sequence of arrival (priority) on the LAD at the POD. It should be left blank if the unit is in place. The entry is optional if the unit is going to
             an ocean area or is on call to the POD.

   (f)   AD--Priority add-on is the alphabetic code used to insert a force requirement into the priority arrival sequence without resequencing already assigned priorities.
            This entry is left blank if the unit is in place. The entry is optional if the unit is on call to the POD.

NOTE: A printed TPFFDL is not required to be included with the plan when the TPFDD file is made available to subordinate units through ADP or distributed
printouts.

                                this plan (such as Annex H, Weather Operations). Avoid listing standard documents used
                                in peacetime.

1.     ()   MISSION AND CONCEPT OF INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS

       a. ( ) Mission. State concisely the intelligence mission as it relates to the planned operation. Refer to the
command mission statement in the basic plan. When Annex B is distributed separately, also include the command mission
statement from the basic plan.

        b. ( ) Concept of Intelligence Operations. Outline the purpose of intelligence operations. Summarize the
resources and agencies to be employed in directing, collecting, processing, producing, and disseminating the necessary
intelligence during normal and crisis periods prior to, as well as during execution of the OpOrd.

2.     ()   SITUATION

       a. ( ) Characteristics of the Area. Provide a summary of the physical, economic, political, medical, social, and
psychological aspects and conditions of the area of operations as they may influence the concept of the plan. Don’t repeat
information included in the general situation discussed in the basic plan. Include a sufficient analysis of the area of
operation to permit development of supporting plans. Include complete information or preferably reference documents and
reports which contain required intelligence information.

       b. ( ) Weather and Terrain. Describe the environmental factors such as weather and terrain in the projected

RECONNAISSANCE OPERATIONS TO SUPPORT NUCLEAR OPTIONS (U)

(U)    REFERENCES:               List documents and other plans that have a significant bearing on the conduct of
                                 reconnaissance operations to support nuclear options.

1.       ( ) OBJECTIVE. State what type of information is to be provided through airborne reconnaissance and to whom
(i.e., national-level decision maker, theater-level commander, or weapons employment unit). Briefly identify the airborne
reconnaissance effort required by system, if known, (e.g., TR-1/ ASARS II, U-2/SENIOR SPAN, RC-135/RIVET JOINT) to
support nuclear options. Refer to the basic plan and include information that would affect airborne reconnaissance
operations.

2.      ( ) OPTION DESCRIPTION. Provide a general description of each operation (combination of platform, sensors,
data links, ground stations) to include geographic locations and types of targets (fixed or mobile). Use suboptions within an
option to break down a large number of objective targets into more manageable groups. Use the table format attached to
this tab to provide specific information for proposed individual strikes within an option or suboption. Include an orientation
map for each option indicating DGZs.

3.      ( ) CONSIDERATIONS. Briefly state special considerations or circumstances that affect the employment of
airborne reconnaissance forces in support of nuclear options. Establish response times of airborne reconnaissance assets.
Briefly describe capability to perform missions with organic airborne reconnaissance assets. If, to achieve desired
reconnaissance coverage, the commander will need NCS coordination in tasking national reconnaissance assets, or
overhead or airborne assets operated by the commander of other unified or specified commands or the Director of the NSA,
state that need here.

4.     ()   SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS. Address each of these subjects:

       a. ( )     Execution. Clearly state the airborne reconnaissance execution authority as outlined in the JSCP, Volume
II, Annex C.

                                                                        CLASSIFIED BY:

        b. ( ) Commitment of Forces. Designate or allocate airborne reconnaissance, both standoff and penetrating,
forces to support nuclear options. Refer to guidance for the commitment of reconnaissance assets provided in JSCP,
Volume II, Annex C.

       c. ( ) Tasks. List the detailed tasks to be performed by each subordinate command to support nuclear options.
Include forward basing options when deployed operations are required.

       d. ( ) Timing. Time aircraft sorties to achieve the earliest possible collection of data consistent with sensor
capability, data link capability (if any), aircrew availability, and system survivability. Remember system survivability is a
function of platform, sensor, data link, and ground station survivability.

       e.   ()    Planning Restrictions. Establish appropriate planning restrictions to include over-flight restrictions.

       f.    ( ) Processing. Establish special requirements or procedures for processing mission products once received
by an appropriate ground station or analysis component. Provide approximate number of hours required for processing,
exploiting, and reporting mission products.

       g. ( ) Reporting. Include specific procedures and time lines for reporting airborne reconnaissance information.
Specify that the primary means to report nuclear operations data is through the Joint Reporting Structure as outlined in the
Coordination of Atomic Operations SOP.

       h. ( ) Prestrike Reconnaissance. Specify requirements for, and capability to conduct prestrike airborne
reconnaissance. Recommend tabular format to address airborne system (platform/ sensor combinations) capabilities versus
general categories of reconnaissance data requirements needed to support various nuclear options.

       i.   ( ) Coordinating Instructions. Give information and procedural guidance necessary to coordinate the
airborne reconnaissance effort. Include:

            (1) ( )    Special rules of engagement.

            (2) ( )    Requirements for coordination with national strategic plans or programs.

1.     ()   SITUATION

        a. ( ) Enemy. See Annex B, Intelligence. Define the enemy from a force protection perspective. Outline the
threat throughout the spectrum of the plan--if the threat to the force is criminal at first (during increased tensions or during
deployment), moving through low insurgent/terrorist and terminating during the campaign with open conflict--and define
the threat for each.

       b. ( ) Friendly. See Task Organization. Highlight the assets available to the commander to support his
protection plan. This description will highlight police agencies (SF, OSI, etc.) both military and supporting non-military
(include host nation agencies which will be available for assistance), as well as non-police assets which can assist in force
protection tasks. In each tab, highlight the special troops which may assist the commander deal with that aspect of force
protection (for example, counterterrorist special operations forces--military or SWAT type civilian).

2.    ( ) MISSION. State the force protection mission in terms of the operation. Force protection planning and actions
must be established at the onset. Overall mission success rests on effective force protection operations and structure.

3.      ( ) EXECUTION. Commanders view force protection as a primary building block to mission effectiveness and
execution. The nature of the operation(s), MOOTW to MRC, will affect in-place force protection resources and execution
of portions of the plan. Activities of the adversary (organized combat elements or high-grade criminals) and the developing
threat during the prosecution of an operation call for separate appendices for each "phase" or "contingency" to enhance the
understanding of the plan. Also, detail a plan for force protection from and notification of severe weather events and other
natural phenomena.

       a. ( ) Concept of Operations. Provide the commander’s visualization of the operation, in each phase, and
describe what will be done to protect the force during each.

        b. ( ) Tasks. In separate numbered subparagraphs for each subordinate force protection component of the force,
assign tasks and responsibilities necessary to complete the mission. Describe what to do, not how to do it. Task assignment
must include when and where to perform the task. This brief description will be followed by details in the appropriate tab
to this appendix.

      c. ( ) Coordinating Instructions. Instructions applicable to two or more units are covered in this subparagraph.
Examples include host nation law enforcement coordination and interplay with other support agencies (e.g., Judge
Advocate, Public Affairs).

4.     ()   ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS

     a. Logistics. Describe the special equipment needed for the support of force protection operations. Identify the
command points of contact for detailed information and special equipment funding either here or in the tabs.

       b. ( ) Administration. Describe the measures peculiar to the administration and prosecution of the force
protection plan. If there are documents or guidelines other than common use doctrinal and regulatory material, tell the
subordinate units what they are, where to get them, and when they become effective. Refer to the tabs to implement the
parts of the force protection program as much as possible; reserve this subparagraph for universal information.

        c. ( ) Reports. Describe the command’s requirements for reporting force protection activities and contingencies,
e.g., THREATCON implementation measures, SIR’s, etc. This subparagraph must focus on two way communication--tell
the subordinate units how information will be given to them and in what frequency; and describe what reports are required
and how often from them to the commander. Tell subordinate units how (means of transmission) the commander wants to
get force protection data and how often updates are required. If it is more applicable to outline these peculiarities in each
tab, so state.

5.      ()   COMMAND AND SIGNAL

        a. ( ) Command Relationships. Describe any special relationships that may exist in the calling up of force
protection assets and the times of jurisdiction exchange for resolution of conflict. If command authority does not follow
lines of rank but rather lines of special control, these must be described before the fact. Detailed information will be placed
in the tabs as well. Emphasis must also be given to "appeal authority" needed to resolve differences which may arise in the
resolution of some aspect of the force protection operation (e.g., use of force to neutralize a hostage situation).

      b.     ()   C3 Systems. Identify C3 system requirements for support of the force protection mission and/or refer to
Annex K.

       a.   ()    Enemy. Refer to Annex B.

       b.   ()    Friendly. List other historical documentation efforts of allies, other services, etc., as appropriate.

       c.   ()    Assumptions. List assumptions affecting the plan in addition to those listed below.

             (1) ( ) Historian responsibilities in the theater of operations expand significantly and require increased
manning versus normal peacetime operations. The History function will maintain 24-hour, 7-day per week operations to
support collection and documentation efforts of USAF combat and combat support operations.

           (2) ( ) Historians will deploy as early as possible to the theater of operations. This is critical to the successful
documentation of the early events and decisions that shape the operation.

            (3) ( ) The Artifact Collection Team (ACT) will deploy to theater of operations about 30-40 days into an
operation. Only team members will be involved in the actual collection, catologing, and shipping of artifacts.

       d. ( ) Resource Availability. List resource availability for a specific plan, noting any restrictions on the below
outlined resources.

             (1) ( ) All enlisted (AFSC 3H051 and higher) and officer (AFSC 84H0) historians, active-duty and ARC, are
available to meet mobility requirements. Enlisted 3H031s will not be deployed unless specifically approved by their
MAJCOM/HOs as having the training and experience to function effectively in the deployed environment. Historians tasked
to deploy must possess a TOP SECRET clearance.

                                                                          CLASSIFIED BY:

            (2) ( ) All civilian historians holding Emergency Essential (E-E) positions in the theater of operations will
remain in place or be redeployed within the theater to meet requirements. Historians tasked to deploy must possess a TOP
SECRET clearance.

             (3) ( ) Non E-E civilian historians will be reassigned outside the theater of operations to backfill vacant
positions.

       e.    ()   Planning Factors. List applicable planning factors in addition to the items listed below.

           (1) ( ) Determine wartime manpower requirements for the theater of operations based on the following factors
and formula:

                 (a) ( ) Each wing requires sufficient historians to maintain 24-hour, 7-day a week, collection and
documentation efforts for the duration of the operation.

                    (b) ( ) The workload of the history office is driven primarily by numbers and types of weapon systems as
well as variety and complexity of unit missions. The following matrix uses number of flying squadrons assigned to a unit as
the initial factor in determining number of historians required by the unit. It assumes standard aircraft squadron sizes and a
mix of weapon systems and missions. Adjustments should be based on significant differences with these assumptions. For
example, a unit with 10 squadrons of the same aircraft type/mission would require fewer historians than the matrix calls for,
while a unit with wide range of aircraft types and missions (such as special mission aircraft) might need additional
historians assigned to effectively accomplish the history mission. Deviations from the historian requirements established in
the below matrix will be coordinated with responsible MAJCOM/HO AND HQ USAF/HO (POC: CMSgt Ed Stevens, DSN
754-2170).

                  # Flying Squadrons Assigned Unit                # Historians Required
                                  1                                         1
                                  2                                         2
                                 3-4                                        3
                                 5-6                                        4
                                 7-8                                        5
                                9-10                                        6
                               11-14                                        7
                             15 or more                                     8

                  (c) ( ) AFSC Substitutions: None. Do not substitute civilian historians for military personnel when
establishing deployment requirements, except where civilians are employed within the overseas theater (for example,
PACAF or USAFE) and will remain there.

2.      ( ) MISSION. The Air Force must capture the valuable lessons of war and contingency operations through the
rapid and comprehensive collection and preservation of historically significant documentation. During war and
contingency operations, the primary mission of the historian is to collect documentation, record interviews with key
participants, and prepare reports. Their secondary mission is to provide historical services directly supporting the conduct
of combat and combat support operations. Additionally, it is essential that the Air Force identify, collect, and preserve
artifacts of historical significance from both the friendly and enemy forces.

3.     ()   EXECUTION

        a. ( ) Concept of Operations. Success of history operations are dependent on two primary factors. First, access
to significant events, meetings, documents, etc, regardless of classification or sensitivity. Second, timely collection and
distribution of data to accelerate the analysis process to support senior decision makers. Air Force historians collect,
preserve, evaluate, and interpret evidence to disseminate accurate, complete, and descriptive accounts of operations and
activities for use in planning, operations, doctrine, education, training, and policy and decision making at all levels of
command.

             (1) ( ) Activities. In direct support of combat operations, historians collect, organize, and preserve
documentation required to prepare accurate and comprehensive historical records of combat and combat support activities
and provide historical services as required by commander and staff. To accomplish this, historians must attend meetings
and briefings, review all correspondence (letters, messages, E-mail, staff packages, etc.), review all computerized databases,
correlate collected data, interview key participants, and prepare required historical products. Historians also provide
reference services to the commander and staff.

              (2) ( ) Organization. Specify how historians fit into the organizational structure at all levels. Also explain
their relationship and responsibilities to joint history functions.

             (3) ( ) In-place Forces. Identify locations where in-place historian resources must be maintained in support of
the specific plan.

       b.   ()    Tasks

                  (d) ( ) Coordinates deployment of Contingency Historical Information Preservation (CHIP) Teams.
Attached to the Air Force Component Command (AFCC) headquarters in theater, CHIP teams preserve the record of USAF
combat operations by microfilming or scanning key documents, copying important databases, conducting oral history
interviews, and preparing historical products.

              (e) ( ) Coordinates deployment of Artifact Collection Team. These teams will be attached to the
AFCCer headquarters in theater.

3.      ( ) RESPONSIBILITIES. State that while the overall responsibility for implementing IPSS rests with the
supported commander, the service component commanders perform major actions. Identify responsibilities of component
commanders to make the deficiencies of their units known to the wholesale supplier and service headquarters, obtain IPSS
availability data from the wholesale inventory manager, and coordinate with the supported commander in developing
logistic annex to the OPLAN. Include guidance on responsibilities in the required detail as shown in the example below.

Major Actions or Tasks                                                   Responsible Agency
1. Identify the IPSS 30-day requirements,                                Support commander,

NOTES:

       1     Deficiency in this context is the difference between the supported commander’s 30-day requirements and
materiel that is pre-positioned.

     2    IPSS data, when available, is to replace notional nonunit-related IPSS and movement data with actual IPSS and
movement data.

4.    ( ) LIMITING FACTORS. Describe limitations that could adversely affect resupply regardless of IPSS
procedures.

5.    ( ) ESTIMATE OF MATERIEL REQUIREMENTS. Prepare materiel requirements in the formats shown in Tabs
A through C -- IPSS data covering the supported commander’s first day requirements.

NOTE:       These three tabs are designed to assist logistic planners to determine which critical supplies, as specified by the
supported commanders, must start moving during the first 15 days of CONUS activity to prevent a resupply lag in support
of the implemented OPLAN. It is anticipated that normal requisition procedures and IPSS actions would begin in
approximately 30 days, thereby negating prolongation of the IPSS procedures.

Tabs:
        A--Petroleum (IPSS -- 30-Day Requirements)
        B--Ammunition (IPSS -- 30-Day Requirements)
        C--Major End-Items (IPSS -- 30-Day Requirements)

NOTE:      Tabs A, B, and C are not required in order to submit the OPLAN to CJCS for final review and approval.
However, Tabs A, B, and C must be submitted to CJCS within 90 days of OPLAN submission.

INTERSERVICE AND HOST NATION SUPPORT AGREEMENTS (U)

REFERENCES                List documents necessary to completely understand this appendix, i.e., Joint Pub 1-03.21, JRS,
                          Joint Operation Planning, DOD Instruction 4000.19, Interservice, Interdepartmental, and
                          Interagency Support, and DOD Directive 5530.3, International Agreements.

1.     ( ) GENERAL. State that the purpose of this appendix is to identify specific agreements with host nations or other
services, by base, to provide wartime support either for or by Air Force units. Use this appendix to guide Air Force units
negotiating with other services (e.g., a Memorandum of Agreement) or with host nations (e.g., a Joint Logistics Support
Plan) to provide for wartime support to be furnished for or by Air Force elements. Before negotiation with the host nation is
undertaken, ensure members have permission in accordance with DODD 5530.0 and AFI 51-701. Incorporate information
on agreements which provide wartime support in this appendix.

2.      ( ) CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS. State the responsibilities of the services and host nations which identify and
satisfy support requirements. Emphasize the need to achieve maximum other service support through the use of support
agreements. State the need to define and formalize in agreements, to the extent possible, other service requirements that
would be levied on Air Force units. Likewise, state the need for equally well-defined and formalized agreements on support
that could be provided by other services or host nations to support Air Force units. Where practicable and mutually agreed
upon, wartime support requirements which are included in appropriate reception/base support plans need not be duplicated
in formal agreements.

emergency essential civilians (U.S. and foreign nationals).

2.     ( ) MISSION. State the mission is to ensure the right type and quantity of subsistence is planned and available at
the right time and place to sustain combat and combat support forces.

3.      ()   EXECUTION

      a. ( ) Concept of Operations. Describe the concept of operations that will ensure subsistence support is linked
primarily to combat objectives rather than to cost objectives, and to the extent practical, that subsistence logistics
responsibilities and procedures are the same in war as in peace to provide adequate training and orderly transition in
emergencies.

                                                                         CLASSIFIED BY:

       b.   ()   Tasks. For each area, task appropriate DLA, service or allied elements for:

            (1) ( ) Ordering, inspecting, issuing, and transporting subsistence.

            (2) ( ) Procurement of or establishing subsistence storage.

            (3) ( ) Rotation of PWRMS subsistence.

       c    ()   Responsibilities

             (1) ( ) For each area of the theater where the theater CINC has assigned common item subsistence support
to a component, define the area and identify the dominant component’s overall responsibilities for integrated support.
Include in Tabs A, B, and C to Appendix 8 to Annex D of this plan all support arrangements required for common item
subsistence support operations.

           (2) ( ) In each area and at each echelon from user to source, specify the subsistence support responsibilities
and procedures to include forms to be used (i.e., USAFE, Air Force, Army, Navy, Marine Corps, or DPSC).

             (3) ( ) For each Air Force supported base, list in Tab A of this appendix the quantity of pre-positioned
subsistence war reserve materiel (WRM) at each WRM storage point required to support time-phased deployments pending
resupply. Show the depletion date (PWRS cutoff date) taking into account command overflow and rations deployed with
self-sustaining units. Ensure the TPFDD reflects differences between on-hand stocks and resupply required to alleviate any
PWRMS shortfall.

       d.   ()   Limiting Factors

          (1) ( ) If subsistence support responsibilities and procedures in war are different than those in peace, list
recommended changes.

            (2) ( ) Describe any other factors which may adversely degrade operations of the combat and combat
support forces due to substandard subsistence support.

       e. ( ) Coordinating Instructions. Coordinate this appendix (down, up, and laterally) between staff sections,
organizations, and commands to ensure personnel in all applicable agencies are aware of their responsibilities.

       a. ( ) Concept of Operations. Describe the contracting functions in support of the plan. Where a functional
area designates essential services to be continued during crisis, the contracting office will obtain contractor contingency
plans and work force information in an attempt to provide reasonable assurance of continued performance, and planning
information to activities relying on contract services.

                 (1)      ()      Marshaling. Contracting manpower requirements are based on base population, type of
base (BB/COB/MOB), source availability and distance to travel for items needed from the local economy, and security
measures required at the deployment site. The more austere the destination, the earlier contracting should be scheduled in
the deployment flow.

2.   ( ) MISSION. State concisely the comptroller mission as it relates to the planned operation. Refer to the

3.     ()   EXECUTION.

        a. ( ) Concept of Operations. Summarize the intended course of action and state the general concept for
establishing, conducting, controlling, and sustaining essential comptroller operations. For example:

             (1) ( ) Comptroller, budget, cost analysis and disbursing agent operations will be established at non-MOB
locations with two combat aircraft squadrons; estimated supported population of 2,500.

             (2) ( ) Comptroller, budget, cost analysis, and disbursing agent operations will be established at non-MOB
locations with one combat aircraft squadron; estimated supported population of 1,500.

           (3) ( ) A disbursing agent operation will be established at locations with an estimated population between
500-1,499. Comptroller, budget, cost analysis and accounting support will be provided by the supporting MOB comptroller.


                                                             E-3-2

AFMAN 10-401V2 1 MAY 1998
                                                    CLASSIFICATION

             (4) ( )   A paying agent will be established at non-MOB locations with a population between 100-499
personnel.

           (5) ( ) A "circuit rider" paying agent from the supporting MOB will provide comptroller support to non-
MOB locations with a population between 1-99 personnel.

             (6) ( ) A disbursing pay agent resource (XFFA2) will be deployed from the supporting MOB to non-MOB
locations as required for initial reception and beddown of forces. The disbursing agent will carry the initial operating cash
and funding authority. (This concept helps ensure a continuity of operations exists between the MOB and non-MOB
operating locations.)

             (7) ( ) CONUS Augmentation of Supported Commands. Comptroller personnel to support non-MOB
locations will be deployed from the CONUS directly to non-MOB locations as required. CONUS personnel will be time-
phased to arrive at a location consistent with the force buildup at the location. However, the supporting MOB will provide a
paying agent to each location with a population between 100-499. Therefore, CONUS comptroller personnel time-phased
in to perform paying agent duties will be deployed to MOBs and subsequently assigned to the non-MOB operating location.

        b. ( ) Tasks. The Comptroller Annex to the War and Mobilization Plan, Volume I, (WMP-1) provides
substantively more planning guidance on how to formulate Comptroller actions in real-world OPLANs. Also, AFI 10-213
provides functional guidance. Supported command comptroller planners (i.e. USCENTAF, PACAF, and USAFE) must
develop theater-unique wartime CONOPS plans to define how peacetime operations will transition to wartime operations in
their area of responsibility. The wartime manpower in the comptroller annex to the War and Mobilization Plan, Volume I,
and the Comptroller Wartime Manpower Standard provide a baseline for developing TPFDD requirements. Keep in mind
that the focus planning is to identify the full scope of tasks we must accomplish to support initial and sustained operations
(30 days into the war and beyond).

             (1) MOB-COB Alignments. It is essential that individuals doing comptroller planning know all of the
locations that are aligned to the MOBs and that this alignment is documented in OPLANs. Understanding the total number
of COBs (with or without an on-site comptroller function), that must be supported by the MOB, is essential to accurately
size the MOB’s workload. Similarly, when sizing the workload for a given disbursing agent operation at a given COB you
should establish some workload factor for COB locations (less than 500 personnel) that will be supported by the disbursing
agent.

             (2) Comptroller Planning Guidance. Comprehensive planning requires an assessment of the full range of
tasks that must be accomplished in wartime. In order to properly evaluate the given tasks, the individuals accomplishing
the assessment must: (1) be knowledgeable of the requirements in the functional area being assessed; (2) be familiar with
the Air Staff planning guidance in Annex N to WMP-1; (3) be knowledgeable of the planning guidance in AFI 10-213; and
be familiar with the provisions of the theater’s Comptroller Wartime Concept of Operations (CONOPS). Through close
evaluation of each task, the planner must determine:

                 (a) ( ) Whether the stated task must be accomplished to sustain the mission objective of the plan. (i.e.
The task of vouchering local AFO authorized payments is an example of a peacetime task that will continue in wartime.
The task of preparing local military payrolls is an example of a task that will not be accomplished in wartime IAW AFI 10-
213.)

                   (b) ( ) Whether a variation of the stated task must be accomplished. (i.e. The termination of regular
local payrolls will require an alternate method for paying personnel who previously received paychecks.)

                   (c) ( ) Whether there are any functional tasks that are unique only to wartime that must be
accomplished. (i.e. Assuming the functional responsibility as the on-base banking facility is an example of a wartime-
unique function. Tasks associated with the replenishment of the AFO’s operating cash (bank no longer available) and
distribution of cash to disbursing agents, etc., are other examples of wartime-unique workload.)

       c. ( ) Coordinating Instructions. This subparagraph must include, but not be limited to, coordinating with other
Services which will be affected by this plan.

4.     ( ) ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS. Provide a statement of the administrative and logistic arrangements
applicable to comptroller but not covered in the basic plan or another annex.

       a. ( ) Logistics. Detail, at a minimum, logistic requirements for providing: funding authority, cash, security of
funds, replenishment of cash, comptroller unique forms, supplies, and equipment.

         b ( ) Administration. List, at a minimum, requirements for special reports and other special requirements.
Also, address any theater unique peacetime arrangements which will impact comptroller operations (i.e. In PACAF, the
Army provides all contracting support for American forces in Korea.) Address administration for paying claims against the
U.S. arising from DOD operations according to U.S. law, pertinent military directives, and international agreements.
Address procedures for identifying, recording, and setting foreign currency exchange rates.

5.     ()   COMMAND AND SIGNAL

       a. ( ) Command Relationships. Provide details on comptroller command relationship issues. Specifically,
address chain of command for budget and funding issues if the supported command "chops" to allied organizations or falls
under different organizations in wartime, i.e. USAFE chops to NATO and becomes part of three different allied
organizations. Refer to Annex J.
       b. ( ) C3 Systems. Identify specific comptroller C3 system requirements or refer to Annex K.

1.     ( ) GENERAL GUIDANCE. Base level plans should be prepared as a supplement to MAJCOM plans. Review
the MAJCOM plan under these circumstances. See Joint Pub 0-2 and other references, including interservice support
agreements, for information to include in this paragraph. Add general information on conditions expected to exist which
could affect the achievement of the plan’s objectives if the plan is executed. Describe the main objectives and overall
concept of operations in the context of JA’s mission as stated in WMP-1, Annex P, to provide subordinate offices a clear
understanding of their roles and responsibilities. This is an appropriate place to list the procedures that subordinate offices
must use to request additional manning.



                                                             E-4-2

                                                            C-208

        a. ( ) Legal Support. State what legal support activities will be continued after this OPLAN is executed and any
statutory exceptions affecting support plans. Note that legal support for the base legal office is included in the combat
support element and cannot be tasked independently.

              (1) ( ) Indicate that judge advocate functions will be accomplished on a timely and efficient basis; however,
priority will be given to providing advice to commanders at the AFCC level within the unified command, joint task force, or
other joint organization and at subordinate wing levels. Subordinate legal offices will fulfill all judge advocate functions and
responsibilities, unless otherwise instructed by the AFCC staff judge advocate in consultation with the unified command
staff judge advocate and, normally, with the concurrence of The Judge Advocate General of the Air Force.

             (2) ( ) Ensure that legal support for increased military justice activity is considered. Military judges (Unit
Type Code (UTC) XFFJ1), circuit counsel and paralegal support (UTC XFFJ2), and court reporters (UTC XFFJ4) can be
tasked for deployment to a CINC’s area of responsibility (AOR). Area defense counsel and area defense administrators can
be similarly tasked for deployment (UTC XFFJ2). Refer to procedures for requesting additional personnel in paragraph 1
above.

             (3) ( ) Additional judge advocates can be deployed to augment specific functions; e.g. claims disasters,
aircraft accident investigations, friendly fire incidents, war crimes investigations, environmental matters, procurement
functions; and for any other needed support tasking. UTC XFFJ3 should normally be used for these deployments. This JA-
unique UTC has limitless application and should be used to deploy judge advocates and paralegals into an AOR to support
operations there. This UTC contains one JAG and one paralegal; any MAJCOM can task this UTC as many times as
necessary to ensure the right number of personnel are assigned to a location. Again, refer to paragraph 1 for the procedures
to request these additional personnel, unless directed to use different procedures for the purpose of augmenting certain AOR
offices or functions.

       b. ( ) Assumptions. List the basic assumptions on which legal support planning is based and particularly any
assumptions not contained in the OPLAN’s basic planning assumptions that may influence legal support for the plan. For
example, it may be helpful to include the reason for the deployment; i.e.; is this essentially a peacetime operation; is the
deployment part of a peacekeeping mission pursuant to the UN Charter or other international agreement; is the deployment
an act of individual or collective self-defense against an armed attack; is the deployment initiated to protect US material,
equipment or installations, etc. Inclusion of this information serves to provide a focus for legal considerations (for example,
security assistance implications, legal agreements relevant to the deployment, compliance with the CJCS Standing ROE,
environmental matters, etc.).

2.     ( ) SPECIFIC GUIDANCE. Coordinate with the staff judge advocates of supported unified commanders and
service component commanders to establish responsibility for the scope of legal activities expected from the supporting
command staff judge advocates. For each location in the plan, identify the supporting staff judge advocate office(s) and the
number of personnel assigned. Also identify the supporting base for the area defense counsel and the defense paralegal.
Normally, the supporting base area defense counsel will be in the CONUS. In separate paragraphs, state policies, assign
responsibilities, and cite applicable references and interservice support agreements for the legal activities to be provided,
termed herein as planning factors. The following are suggested minimum requirements. Unique circumstances within an
AOR may dictate exceeding these requirements or the need to eliminate or modify some of them.



                                                             E-4-3

        a. ( ) International Legal Considerations. At a minimum, state: that US forces are required to comply with the
LOAC; that commanders will ensure that personnel under their command are aware of this requirement; whether or not
there is a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) in effect, and if so, describe its pertinent provisions. If not, describe the
status of US forces in the absence of any agreement; that commanders will maximize jurisdiction over US forces and any
civilians accompanying them; which official will have the authority to release military or civilian personnel to foreign
authorities; the reporting requirements for incidents which could result in judicial action by foreign civil authority; that
certain procedures will apply concerning requests for refuge and political asylum and what they are; any other limitations
that host nations’ laws or customs may impose on US forces; that international law may have an environmental component
based on international agreements, customary international law, US policy, and DOD regulations, and how this may affect
the OPLAN.

       b. ( ) Reporting Violations of Law of War. State the channels for making these reports and preserving evidence
documenting violations, including the assignment of responsibility for the preservation of this evidence, what each LOAC
incident report will contain, and, if any occur, the procedures for reporting enemy LOAC violations.

        c. ( ) Operations Law, Rules of Engagement and Targeting. Indicate JA responsibilities with regard to the
following; participation on battle staff and on special planning groups to perform functions related to formulating master
attack plans, selecting targets and making weaponeering decisions, and creating air tasking orders (ATOs); devising and
negotiating operating instructions covering combined forces in air operation, and; crafting and reviewing rules of
engagement (ROE) for air operations and security forces. (At a minimum, ROE should be reviewed by judge advocates for
clarity, consistency, and compliance with international law and to ensure they have been coordinated with the other
Services, the unified command, and the NCA.). JAGs should also determine: when Riot Control Agents (RCAs) can
lawfully be used prior to and during hostilities; what overflight and basing rights exist and those which may need to be
negotiated; how operations in neutral airspace will be conducted; what intelligence oversight and related issues need to be
addressed; and whether there are any environmental considerations that should or must be addressed.

        d. ( ) Claims. Indicate what claims provisions exist in any applicable SOFAs, treaties, and agreements; what
Service if any has single-service claims responsibility per DOD Dir 5515.8; who will be the senior official in-theater for
approving claims, including personal property claims; whether the Service exercising single-service claims authority will
appoint members of other Services to act as foreign claims commissions; what prior approval need be obtained before
appointing these members of other Services as foreign claims commissions; if possible, what will be the geographical area
of responsibility for each commission; that, no matter what Service actually processes the claims, those processing claims
will use the claims regulations, forms, procedures and funds of the Service exercising single-service claims responsibility;
what claims fund cite to use for paying claims; how claims will be recorded in a computerized database when one Service
has single-service claims responsibility; what claims are not payable (e.g., damage caused by enemy action or by U.S. armed
forces in combat); how admiralty claims will be handled; if solatium payments are authorized for that area and how that
program is to work; if there is a "Blood Chit" program, in effect, how this program works; and whether there are any
specific claims issues or problems in the country involved.

        e. ( ) Military Justice. State whether the authority for exercising court-martial jurisdiction in the AOR has been
obtained from the host country or countries. State who will be authorized to convene general and special courts-martial in
the AOR, and who will exercise that authority in the event courts-martial are convened in the AOR (R.C.M. 201(e); AFI
51-201). If convening authority designations or authorizations are necessary, state who will designate or authorize the
convening authorities required (e.g., the unified or specified commander, SECDEF, SECAF, or TJAG). State how
nonjudicial punishment (NJP) actions imposed on Air Force members by commanders of other Services will be handled:
e.g., under what circumstances will interservice NJP be imposed, the member’s rights regarding consultation with defense
counsel, who will handle appeals from interservice NJP, and will designation of appellate authorities by AFLSA/JAJM be
required. State how processing of interservice NJP will ensure that appeals and collateral actions (e.g., UIF, selection record
filing) will be accomplished within Air Force channels. State whether the "in time of war" provisions of the UCMJ apply
(R.C.M. 103(19); Part IV, MCM, 1984); whether the UCMJ applies to US citizens and US permanent resident civilians
accompanying the US Forces in the field during time of war, including DOD contractor personnel (Article 2(a)(10) and
Article 2(a)(11); what the commander must approve to assert UCMJ jurisdiction over a civilian; what arrangements are
necessary for the court-martial and the personnel required; and what confinement facilities will be used).

        f.   ( ) Legal Assistance. State the priority of services, if any, and any limitation on the scope of the program; list
the rules governing marriage between U.S. military members and foreign and host nationals in a host nation and between
members of the U.S. armed forces overseas; identify taxation, SSCRA, Veterans Reemployment Rights Law, and related

such funding; invoking the Food and Forage Act, 41 U.S.C. Section 11; providing NBC (Nuclear, Chemical, Biological)
protective gear to civilians; providing manpower, equipment, and supplies to relieve a civilian population from the burdens
of war; conducting aircraft accident investigations and conducting fratricide investigations involving incidents occurring
between USAF forces, between USAF forces and those of other Services, and between USAF forces and those of allied
services; and the impact of any environmental laws, international or host nation agreements and treaties containing
provisions related to environmental concerns, and other environmental rules, instructions, and guidance, including any
limitations they may create.

     h. ( ) Host Nation Support. Set out what agreements apply. (Note that some of these agreements, such as
SOFAs, MOUs, and exchanges of notes, are or will be classified, that gaining access to them may be difficult, and that US
Embassy personnel may be the best source for this information).

procedures addressed in other annexes of the plan. Detail what, if any, directives govern the treatment of EPWs.
Specifically, some of the issues which should be included are the retention by EPWs of their military ID or other Geneva
Convention ID cards, the legal requirements for transferring EPWs to the custody of foreign powers; whether an EPW
transfer agreement between U.S. and allied governments will be needed; how EPW requests not to be repatriated will be
treated; whether to issue NBC equipment to EPWs; whether to use EPW volunteers to clear mines, perform other dangerous
activities, and appeal to comrades to surrender; whether mail censorship or the ICRC "Blue slip" address system will be

            (4) ( ) Identify Unit Type Codes (UTCs) to be tasked and the number of judge advocate and paralegal
personnel to be provided at each location. See the Manpower Force Element Listing documents for detailed descriptions of
UTCs. It can be obtained from your local DO or LG office.


                 (a) ( ) Judge advocate support is built into a number of UTCs (eg., wing command, group command).
Review all tasked UTCs and ensure appropriate levels of Judge Advocate support are deployed early to provide legal support
to the commander.

                  (b) ( ) Judge Advocate support for special teams and mission, such as special operations forces, may
be built into a number of other UTCs. Check the Manpower Force Element Listing for potential taskings.

                  (c) ( ) Plans should normally identify potential requirements for judge advocate personnel from the
Air Force Legal Services Agency (AFLSA) for military justice needs, including military defense counsel. (Note that
identified AFLSA requirements must be requested from AFLSA. Procedures should be specified here. During exercise
situations, deployment of these assets should be simulated.)

                 (d) ( )    Additional mission support should be identified using JA unique UTCs XFFJ1 through XFFJ4.

            (5) ( )    Identify expected JA personnel shortfalls based on assessment of operational risks;

            (6) ( ) Limiting Factors. (For example, these may include the general nature of the operational area,

the Annex. At least one JAG and paralegal for each location should hit the ground with the operational commander.

                  (c) ( ) Transportation requirements in the AOR. For example sometimes, (though not normally),
military defense counsel may be tasked to support more than one installation. If so, transportation requirements must be
addressed.

                 (d) ( )    Limiting factors. These can include timing and equipment to be shipped both with deploying
personnel and separately.

3.     ()   EXECUTION

       a. ( ) Concept of Operations. State the planned organization of the public affairs function and the expected flow
of authority and information. For example:

             (1) ( ) General. State the expected general organization of activities that will occur during the execution of
this plan and who is responsible for operations and support.

                 (a) ( ) OASD/PA will provide overall Public Affairs policy and guidance and will manage the media
relations program in the CONUS.

                 (b) ( ) The unified command PA will be responsible for all media relations programs in the AOR. A
secondary mission of the unified command PA will be to oversee the internal information and community relations
programs.

                (c) ( ) The Air Force component command PA [FWD] will be responsible for implementing and
managing its AOR internal information and community relations programs, supporting the Air Force Internal Information
program, and coordinating all unified command-directed media support with the units in the AOR.

                   (d) ( ) The Air Force component command PA [REAR] will plan to support the Air Force component
command PA [FWD] staff as directed. As a rule, the rear staff should plan to develop and manage an internal information
program for rear forces and support the Air Force Internal Information program. Through the component command rear
Battle Staff, provide 24-hour support to Air Force component command PA [FWD]; task manpower and equipment from
supporting commands; propose and disseminate cleared Public Affairs guidance and news releases provided by the forward
staff; and coordinate all Air Force component command media and community relations actions with the Air Force
component command PA [FWD].

                   (e) ( ) When release authority is transferred, outline the anticipated flow of authority and information.
For example, all deployed Air Force units will coordinate all Public Affairs activities with the Air Force component
command PA [FWD]. All others will coordinate with Air Force component command PA [REAR]. Information proposed
for release by units not in the AOR but which may impact upon operations in the AOR will be coordinated with the
component command PA [FWD] through the rear staff.

                (f) ( ) Deployed unit PAOs will plan to implement and manage an aggressive internal information
program and support community relations and media requirements as directed by higher authorities.

            (2) ( )    Specific. State specific activities expected to occur during the execution of the plan. For example:

                   (a) ( ) Plan to provide, both to internal audiences and to the general public news media full, factual,
and timely information, consistent with national security and operational considerations. The rules of OPSEC and
COMSEC will be followed. Identify Essential Elements of Friendly Information (EEFI) and coordinate the information
with the drafters of Annex L.

                  (b) ( ) State the minimum unit organic deployment staffing required to execute the plan. For
example, each deploying independent and dependent aviation unit (active component, Air National Guard, Air Force
Reserve) will be prepared to deploy with sufficient organic Public Affairs assets to support the deployed commander.
Anticipated activity will require each unit to deploy with a minimum of one Public Affairs officer and one enlisted. State
AOR augmentation availability.

                  (c) ( ) State who will be responsible for managing the redistribution of PA resources in support of the
operation or exercise in the AOR when it becomes necessary.

                   (d) ( ) Coordinate all Public Affairs programs with appropriate functional areas to achieve command
objectives, e.g. Command, Operations, Logistics, Psychological Operations, etc.

                  (e) ( ) State who will be responsible for coordinating news conferences and releases in the AOR and
in the rear. For example, senior military commanders may conduct news conferences at sustainment bases with approval of
their MAJCOMs, commanders at deployed locations may conduct news conferences with the approval of Air Force
component command PA [FWD].

      b. ( ) Tasks. In separate subparagraphs, concisely list individual tasks assigned to each element of the
supported and supporting command. For example:

            (1) ( )    All Air Force organizations supporting this operation will plan to:

                (a) ( ) Identify Public Affairs personnel and logistical support needs and coordinate as tasked by the
Air Force component command Battle Staff.

                 (b)   ()   Ensure that all Air Force Public Affairs resources entering the AOR contact forward PA staff.

1.      ( ) GENERAL. State the purpose of this appendix. Provide directions on the procedure to use to facilitate public
affairs manning and augmentation. Identify the AOR and support requirements and the sourcing strategy to use to satisfy
the requirements. State any required rotation policy.

2.      ( ) ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS. Provide a list of the equipment required to execute the mission.
Identify the source of the equipment. Deployments to a bare base or other location with no in-place public affairs support
will require different material than a deployment to an established main operating base. Personnel and equipment
augmentation must be detailed, fully coordinated, and included in the TPFDD.

3.     ()   ASSUMPTIONS List all assumptions that will affect the availability of resources. For example:

      a. ( ) While MAJCOMs directly involved in the operation or exercise are primary players, the entire Air Force
PA community can be involved in support of the operation and all their assets are potentially available for tasking.

       b. ( ) MAJCOMs which will be primary sources for support (AMC, ACC, USAFE, PACAF etc.) will not be
tasked to support other CJCS operations (JTF-Bravo, etc.) for the duration of the operation or exercise.

      c.    ()   Within legal constraints, reserve forces (USAFR and ANG) will also be considered a source of PA
support.

       d.   ()   Theater and regional cultural sensitivities are considered when developing overall deployment policy.


                                                                       CLASSIFIED BY:

       e. ( ) MAJCOMs will maintain a credible, continuing PA mission outside the AOR, both at their headquarters
and at subordinate bases. MAJCOMs must also maintain some capability to respond to other world events in addition to
those in the AOR.

      f.    ( ) Sustainment of operations through several rotation cycles will likely exceed the career field’s ability to
support the proposed taskings for in-place assets and "surge capability."

       g.   ()    Additional manning will be "pulled" selectively into the AOR rather than "pushed" automatically from
outside.

of Annexes C and E so that the PAO is always immediately notified of an accident or incident.

4.     ()   ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS

       a. ( ) Accreditation. Include in this paragraph necessary instructions on accrediting NMRs. Include the
purpose for accreditation, ground rules, and procedures for implementation and revocation. State that accreditation of
NMRs is always instituted. State that to preclude terrorist and enemy infiltration, all NMRs, who are provided access to the
AOR, must show association with recognized media by some form of picture identification. Planners should consider
during planning and implementation that particular countries may have their own procedures for admitting NMRs.

       b. ( ) Arrangements for News Media Representatives (NMR). State the arrangements for NMRs accompanying
units. Listed below are examples of standard arrangements used in most DOD plans. Localize the list to fit the AOR and
the command’s ability to provide service. The NMRs are used to these rules so it is best to keep them consistent from one
plan to the next.

         (1) ( ) Facilities. Facilities and logistic support must be provided on a non-interference-with-mission basis,
when commercial facilities are not available. (Coordinate this paragraph with drafters of Annexes D and K.)

            (2) ( ) Inoculations. Correspondents accompanying forces in the field are required to have the same
inoculations required for military personnel participating in the operation. The NMR should have arrived at the JIB ready to
deploy. However, some may still require inoculations. Coordinate the potential requirement with medical personnel.

            (3) ( ) Expenses. In the absence of commercial facilities, messing and billeting may be extended to NMRs
on a space-available basis. Coordinate the requirement for support with the plans services POC and provide an estimate of
the number of NMRs that may need assistance. The expenses must be borne by individual NMRs.

             (4) ( ) Pools. Depending on the tactical situation, it may be necessary to pool NMRs to cover certain
aspects of an operation. Consider the importance of proper pool composition. All types of media must be represented in the
pool but the pool can be no larger than transportation resources will permit. News media participation in the pool will be
contingent on proper accreditation and acceptance of media ground rules. (See TAB A for media ground rules.)

             (5) ( ) Simulated Rank. All accredited media personnel should be extended the privileges of an officer in
the grade of 0-4 for messing, billeting, and transportation. This provision also applies to reserve or retired officers acting as
civilian NMRs regardless of their reserve or retired grades.

            (6) ( ) Daily Briefing. The director of the JIB and each sub-JIB will arrange for a daily, high-level
UNCLASSIFIED briefing by the on-scene commander or his representative. The briefing will outline, as far as possible
and within the bounds of national security, the day’s plans and operations.

            (7) ( ) Communications. Commands at which sub-JIBs are physically located must provide the media with
communications service when commercial facilities are not available. Identify the location of the facilities in the plan.
Commercial news copy must be transmitted by military communications facilities free of charge and in accordance with
procedures in Annex K.

            (8) ( ) Courier Flights. If government communications facilities are not available, the on-scene commander
must plan for an air courier flight each day for forwarding news materials to appropriate processing or news filing points.
Coordinate the requirement with the operations planners.

             (9) ( ) Transportation. The supported commander has a responsibility to provide to authorized media
representatives, military travel into and within the area of operations: (1) when such travel has been approved by
OASD/PA and; (2) when such travel is in connection with assignments to cover an operation and commercial transportation
is not available. The JIB and sub-JIBs must also be provided dedicated local ground and air transportation to enhance
media coverage.

5.     ()   COMMAND AND SIGNAL

        a. ( ) Press Communication Support. Assess the availability of commercial communications assets to NMRs in
the AOR. When commercial facilities are not available, plan to provide military facilities consistent with availability,
mission and current rules of DOD. As a general operating procedure, no attempt is to be made to censor news copy to be
filed over military communications facilities. However, copy filed over military communications facilities must be reviewed
before transmission, and potential violations of military security must be called to the attention of the sender. If the copy is
not redrafted to overcome valid security objections, it is entirely within the prerogative of the commanding officer of the
unit or communication facility to refuse to accept it for transmission. This prerogative may not be exercised to withhold
potentially embarrassing information from the public.

       b. ( ) Security. List precautions required by the presence of correspondents in operating areas. Consider these
and other applicable concerns:

            (1) ( )    Essential elements of friendly information specified in the OPLAN must be protected.

            (2) ( )    Access to operations, intelligence, and other classified areas must be controlled.

            (3) ( )    Security at the source is necessary.

            (4) ( )    No correspondent is cleared for classified information.

13, Visual Information Documentation (VI). Describe in detail the type of public affairs or photographic documentation
materials for public affairs and documentary purposes. (Coordinate documentation requirements with drafters of Annex C).
List provisions for radio, television, film, and taped coverage, including procedures for clearance, reproduction, and
dissemination. Describe plans for acquiring public affairs and visual information documentation of deployment and
redeployment activities.

TAB A TO APPENDIX 3 TO ANNEX F TO USAFE OPLAN 4123-97 (U)
GENERAL GROUND RULES FOR MEDIA (U)

()     REFERENCES          List references necessary to understand this appendix, such as the unified command plan being
                             supported. The following is provided in case no other guidance is available.

1.      ( ) GENERAL. The principle of maximum information flow to the public is to be followed, consistent with safety
of the force and its security.

       a. ( ) The situation in a military operation is such that correspondents may come into possession of information
that has not been released officially under ground rules set forth in this tab. Such information is not to be transmitted or
publicly released until officially released by American or allied release authorities for their own national forces. US military
media accreditation is issued on this condition.

       b. ( ) The movements of correspondents may, at times, be restricted in certain marshaling, staging, and
maneuver areas. These restrictions are to be kept to a minimum, but they may be applied by a commanding officer when the
security of an operation warrants it. Correspondents must be advised of restrictions by the commanding officer or Public
Affairs officers of the unit involved.

       c. ( ) Any violation of the conditions on ground rules by a correspondent is a basis for suspension or
cancellation of accreditation.

2.     ()   GROUND RULES

       a. ( ) Releasing Authority. The commander, or the JIB director if designated by the commander, is the sole
releasing authority for all military information material contained in all media (audio-visual, photography, drawings, etc.)
gathered or produced within the command area of operations.

      b. ( ) Release of Cleared Information. Information cleared for official release is made available to the press
through one or more of these means:

            (1) ( )    Press releases.

            (2) ( )    Press briefings.

            (3) ( )    Call outs.

1.     ()   SITUATION:

       a. ( ) General. This appendix outlines the requirements for an internal information program effort in support of
the Air Force component commander.

       b. ( ) Assumptions. List any assumptions that are essential to planning for an internal information program by
subordinate commanders. For example:

            (1) ( ) There will be a continuing need for the Air Force to provide timely, reliable information to all
operational and support personnel and family members involved in the operation or exercise as well as to those not directly
involved.

            (2) ( )    The AFCC has a responsibility to support Air Force internal information.

           (3) ( )     State whether sufficient assets are available to satisfy program manpower and equipment
requirements.

             (4) ( ) State at what point in time the AFCC PA office will have release authority for all internal products -
print, photo, and electronic.

           (5) ( ) There will be disinformation generated by potential belligerents that a sound internal information
program will thwart.

2.     ( ) MISSION. State in clear, concise terms the desired results of the internal information program activities
undertaken in support of this OPLAN.

                                                                      CLASSIFIED BY:

3.     ()   EXECUTION

       a. ( ) Concept of Operations. Following is a general CONOPS for all Air Force PA planners to use to integrate
internal information requirements into their support plans. The concept will accommodate most situations. The CONOPS
should be used when the operation being supported is expected to last 45 days or longer. Exercises that test a long-duration
operational plan should also test PA internal information planned support. For shorter-duration operations, plan a scaled
down program using organic assets.

             (1) ( ) General. The CONOPS is for a two-pronged approach to provide a comprehensive internal
information program both in the AOR and for all supporting forces and dependents. A team of practitioners will be
provided to the forward PAO by HQ AFNEWS. The team will comprise the expertise to establish and manage a PA network
in the AOR to link all PA offices together. The AFCC will provide organic unit PA support to the internal information
program. The composite team will develop information for release to all internal audiences.

                  (a) ( ) HQ AFNEWS will form and deploy a minimum of one team of Air Force Public Affairs
practitioners who will obtain and forward timely edited and unedited information materials intended for all internal
information sources. The team will consist of one to seven people, dependent upon the situation addressed by a plan. The
command PA planner will have to design the composition of the team and coordinate the results with AFNEWS/II. The
team will be an Operating Location (OL) of AFNEWS/II and will be attached to the Air Force component command PA
office for administrative support. If there is a forward deployed command element [FWD], the OL will deploy to the
location within seven days of the command’s execution of the basic plan. The OL’s objective is to enhance support to the
AOR internal audiences and maximize the flow of information to all other Air Force internal audiences. The OL will
establish communication channels to the other component commands and all Air Force AOR PA activities to ensure cross
feed of information appropriate to all audiences within and from the AOR.

              (b) ( ) When deployed, the OL will coordinate closely with Air Force Internal Information at HQ
AFNEWS, Kelly AFB, Texas in executing the Air Force Internal Information program.

            (2) ( ) Specific. Specific planning guidance will be provided by AFNEWS/II when provided information on
the operation or exercise being planned for. Generally:


                                                           F-5-2

                  (a) ( ) Plan for the OL to operate out of a fixed location collocated with or in close proximity to the
Air Force component command PA [FWD]. The team will arrive in theater with sufficient computer support, photographic,
audio, and video equipment, and supplies to operate for 30 days. After 30 days, support will be provided by the Air Force
component command. Support requirements will be outlined in TAB B to Appendix 5.

                  (b) ( ) The team will obtain material suitable for use in all aspects of Air Force internal information.
Outlets for the material include AOR local PA newsletters, the theater AFRTS network (when established), the theater
newspaper or news letter, Air Force Radio News, Air Force Now, Airman Magazine, AFRTS outlets worldwide, and the Air
Force News Service. Information will be furnished to other participating component commands when appropriate.

                 (c) ( ) AFNEWS/IIO, News Operations, will be the repository for all releasable information for
internal audiences in order to decrease the workload on component command PA rear staff.

                 (d) ( )    Unit PA assets to devote 50 to 60 % of their time supporting the unit and AOR internal
information program.

      b. ( ) Tasks. In separate subparagraphs, concisely list individual tasks assigned to each element of the
supported and supporting command. For examples of specific support requirements refer to AFR 190-2.

()     REFERENCES: List references necessary to understand this tab.

1.     ( ) List in this tab the equipment required for the Internal Information team that is in addition to the standard PA
equipment package. Total equipment requirements will depend on the make up and mission objectives of the team. A list
of equipment must be tailored for each plan being supported. The equipment package will be in addition to the standard
XFFG3 UTC. When developing the list, factor in any known PA-available organic AOR support. The final equipment list
to support the deployment must be coordinated with the deploying team chief. A non-standard UTC must be added to the
TPFDD to provide transportation for the equipment package, or the XFFG3 UTC can be used for this purpose if the weight
and cube of the package will approximate that UTC load.

2.     ( ) Communications equipment compatible with the communications system expected or documented to exist in
the AOR should be identified. Both inter- and intratheater communications must be considered. Computer
communications equipment must match both the AOR unit PA’s and rear organization’s capability for data transfer.
Consider both hardware and software requirements. Advice on the selection of communications and computer equipment
can be provided by HQ AFNEWS/SC.

       f.   ( ) DOD AFRTS Doctrine: In wartime, a timely flow of information and news is essential to prevent rumors
and to keep U.S. forces informed. Armed with the truth, American military personnel will not easily be misled or
demoralized. The availability of radio and television programming in time of armed conflict is often the single most
important factor in boosting the morale of U.S. combat forces.

2.    ()    MISSION. The mission of the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS) is twofold:

        a. ( ) To provide U.S. military commanders overseas and at sea with sufficient electronic media resources to
effectively communicate Department of Defense, service-unique, theater, and local command information to personnel
under their command.

       b. ( ) To provide U.S. military members, DOD civilians, and their families stationed outside the continental
United States with the same type and quality of American radio and television information and entertainment that would be
available to them if they were in the continental United States.

ARMY/AIR FORCE HOMETOWN NEWS SUPPORT (U)

1.      ( ) GENERAL. This appendix will provide direction to local PAOs on how to use Hometown News services.
Hometown News Service can assist in the successful public acceptance of the execution of planned-for activities. The role
of the function is to gain and increase citizen and local community support for the military, the mobilization and the war
effort. Hometown News can positively influence public support in two ways: through its hometown news releases and
through its features production service.

       a. ( )    Hometown news releases (DD Forms 2266) will be handled in accordance with AFPD 35-2, and the
following:

            (1) ( ) Maintain a local record of completed releases to include the date completed, subject, and the date
forwarded to the Hometown News Service.

            (2) ( ) Notify the Hometown News Service of a major change in status (KIA, MIA etc.) of individuals
submitting a release if the change occurs within 10 days of the day the release was forwarded.

       b. ( ) The Hometown News Service Features Teams are tasked to provide print, radio, and television features on
Army and Air Force deployed units and personnel during contingency and war. The features are provided to local news and
entertainment outlets for presentation to the American public. When planning for features teams to document activities for
release to the general public, anticipate the teams to be TDY for one to two weeks in the AOR and needing PAO escort.
Consider the need for transportation, lodging, and the availability of subjects for interviews. The teams will carry all
necessary technical equipment. Coordinate all requirements for features teams with AFNEWS/HN, Kelly AFB, TX 78241-
5000.

combat zone). Focus assumptions on the conditions expected to exist during the execution of the plan. Indicate alternatives
if the situation does not develop as anticipated.

      d.    ( ) Resource Availability. List resource availability. In a deliberate planning environment, notional forces
are apportioned by the JSCP. List in-place resources planned or being considered for use.

      e.     ( ) Planning Factors. Make maximum use of established doctrine. Include the guidance necessary for the
coordination of command and control support by all tasked commands and agencies. Highlight selected policies, doctrines,
or procedures that are in the references but which need particular emphasis. State completely any procedures that have not
previously been published but that are to be followed during the operation. State any deviations from standard practices
which are authorized by the plan. Consider commonly-overlooked requirements such as COMSEC, frequencies, satellite
access, host nation approval, rotation policy, commercialization of tactical capabilities, etc.

3.    ()      MISSION. State the C4 mission in terms of the overall operation. Inform the executing commands of the C4
systems and procedures required to support the operation. Define the broad tasks and the purposes in order to establish a
basis for integrating and coordinating actions to be taken. Attempt to prioritize capabilities required.

NOTE:       The statement of the C4 mission may require several subparagraphs in view of the many aspects of C4 support.

4.   ()     EXECUTION

      a.     ( ) Operational Concept. Describe briefly, in narrative form, how the entire operation is visualized. Place
particular emphasis on those aspects of the basic plan that establish C4 requirements and affect C4 capabilities and
limitations.

      b.    ( ) Tasks. In a separate subparagraph for each subordinate component or other subdivision of the force,
assign individual C4 tasks and responsibilities. Include instructions that apply only to that component or sub-division.
Cover the entire course of action listed in paragraph 5 of the CINC’s Commander’s Estimate, stating the

task and the unit that is to perform it. (Refer to JOPES, Volume I, Chapter 3, for Commander’s Estimate format.) Inform
each organization what must be done to carry out the C4 mission; however, do not specify how each unit should accomplish
its mission. Include the when and where of the respective missions in the task assignment. Include only a brief narrative of
the tasks in this paragraph. Present the details in the C4 system configuration in the appendices. In the final sub-
paragraph, include the coordinating instructions common to all tasks assigned.

     c.     ()    Special Measures

       (1) ( ) Provide a separate subparagraph of information about each special measure or procedure (e.g., chemical
warfare, equipment decontamination, etc.) that is not covered in paragraph 3a or b but that is necessary to support the
mission. An example would be the requirement for Operations Security (OPSEC) and Communications Security
(COMSEC) measures to operate in a secure, anti-jam mode.

        (2) ( ) Include information on C4 operations that are not part of the main effort. Explain who is going to
perform the particular function of special measures, where it will be done, and what responsibilities the C4 unit of the task
force will have in cooperating in the execution of these special measures. Some examples to consider are routing indicator
allocations, frequency plans, electronic identification procedures, etc.

     (3)    ()    Discuss basic considerations for C4 Protection, referring to Appendix 2 for more detailed guidance.

      (4) ( ) Address communications security (COMSEC) in all OPLANs, either as an internal portion of Annex K or
as an appendix. Address specific COMSEC measures and cryptomaterial considerations as a minimum. Refer to Appendix
1 for guidance in writing a COMSEC appendix.

5.   ()     ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS

      a.     ( ) Logistics. Provide broad instructions about logistic support for C4 operations. Direct users to references,
including Annex D and current logistics instructions. Include wartime procedures for maintaining theater-wide C4 systems
that are under contract and those items typically supported by contract maintenance (i.e., small computers, copiers, land
mobile radios, STU-III telephones, etc) during peacetime . Since Annex K may be distributed separately, repeat important
logistics coordination matters here even though they may have been covered in Annex D. Normally limit remarks in this
paragraph to interservice C4 supply and maintenance matters, for example, assignment of logistic or maintenance
responsibilities to a single component, or other cross-servicing arrangements. If the information is very detailed, prepare a
logistics appendix to the C4 systems annex.

      b.     ( ) Administration. Prescribe requirements for C4 administrative records and reports. Include other
necessary guidance which relates to C4 support for joint operations but which is not covered in the topics previously
discussed in this enclosure.

6.   ()     COMMAND AND SIGNAL

     a.    ( ) Command Relationships. Refer to Annex J. Establish systems control (SYSCON) hierarchy. Identify up-
channel and down-channel reporting requirements.

TAB J TO APPENDIX 3 TO ANNEX K TO COMUSAFE OPLAN 4123-97 (U)
RECORD COMMUNICATIONS

1. PURPOSE. To establish procedures for the preparation, transmission and distribution of message traffic.

2. GENERAL. The record communications (message) network is comprised of fixed and tactical facilities. Routing
indicators and address indicator groups (AIG) will be provided by separate message upon execution of this plan.

3. PROCEDURES.

    a. Message Preparation Format. Units will prepare messages using Joint, Army, Navy, Air Force Publication
(JANAP) 128 and United States Message Text Format (USMTF).

       b. Address Indicator Groups (AIG). If an AIG is used, AOC Plans will verify the members of the AIG and
promulgate the AIG; AOC Plans will ensure the AIG stays current. If an AIG is Joint, it should be published five days prior
to effective date. The promulgation message will indicate effective dates of the AIG.

      c. ATO Receipt Acknowledgment Instructions. All ATOs will have the ZFF-4 signal in format line 4. Action
addressee’s servicing base communications center (BCC) will acknowledge receipt of their respective ATO with ZDF-2
service message. Information addressees need not acknowledge ATOs. BCCs are not to wait until all ATO sections have
been received before generating the ZDF- 2 message. The originating station’s BCC personnel will take follow-up action to
ensure timely acknowledgments are received from all action addressees. ATO tracking personnel will telephonically track
all ATOs and re-transmit sections, as necessary. The SYSCON will compile ATO transmission statistics for AFFOR
headquarters personnel.

     d. Message Processing Facility (MPF) and Distribution Office Function.

          (1) Units serviced by the AFFOR MPF/IM: Message originators may deliver messages direct to the AFFOR MPF.
A list of individuals authorized to receipt for messages must be provided to the AFFOR MPF by AFFOR IM (see tab 1).

         (2) Units serviced by BCC/MPF at other locations: Deployed units are responsible for providing the BCC/MPF at
their deployed location a list of individuals authorized to receipt for message (see tab 1).

          (3) Individuals deployed to forward location who may require the use of the local BCC prior to the activation of
the tactical circuits will be required to provide the MPF a letter, signed by his/her commander, authorizing them to pick up
messages. The letter will indicate individual’s name, rank, SSAN, clearance, effective dates, telephone number(s), and any
special instructions such as, who to notify on messages after duty hours, etc.

        (4) To enhance "writer-to-reader" service, it’s imperative recipients respond expeditiously when notified that a
message is available for pickup from the MPF, especially when FLASH and IMMEDIATE messages are involved.
                                                                       CLASSIFIED BY:

        e. Encryption. Record communications will be transmitted by secure mode. Air Force daily crypto changeover
schedules will be established by the ICP manager or net control stations (NCSs). Each NCS will ensure its connecting
terminals are aware of the scheduled changeover time(s).

         f. Backlog Reporting/Resolution.

         (1) The importance of timely processing of ATOs and high precedence messages cannot be
over-emphasized. In addition to the procedures required by this appendix, MPF supervisors are encouraged to establish
firm local procedures to preclude any unnecessary delays in transmitting the ATOs. BCC/MPF supervisors will use
whatever means are available to expedite message traffic. This includes courier service, HF radio operations, and helicopter
support where available.

         (2) The following general procedures apply to all communications facilities:

                   (a) When a potential backlog exists, be prepared to initiate corrective measures immediately. This may
include calling up stand-by circuits, using available alt-route circuits, courier runs, or any other acceptable method that will
effectively reduce message processing times. Significant backlog, as defined in ACP 121 US Sup 1(e), is "a backlog
condition which exists when messages are unduly delayed at any point (e.g., receive bank, transmit bank, service section,
crypto section, transceiver, etc.) within a communications facility because of insufficient available circuit capacity,
personnel or processing equipment, which may require remedial (e.g., alternate routing, augmentation of personnel, airlift,
reporting to higher authority, etc.)."

               (b) Potential backlog situations that cannot be resolved at the local level will be immediately referred to
the SYSCON or Communications Focal Point (CFP) for resolution.

                  (c) When reporting a backlog situation, the following information is required:

                           1. Total number of messages backlogged, by precedence.

                           2. Circuit(s) involved.

                           3. Any other pertinent information concerning the backlog (i.e., action taken to alt-route
                           traffic, etc.).

                  (d) Telephonic follow-up reports will be required each half hour until the backlog condition is cleared.

      g. Record Traffic Summary.

       (1) Each deployed MPF will provide the AFFOR SYSCON with a daily message traffic summary for the period
0001-2400Z. The report will be transmitted NLT two hours after the period ends.

                                                            K-3-J-2

                   (d) Remarks (List any significant message backlogs experienced, explain excessive handling times, or
other significant record traffic items, or "None", as appropriate).

                       NOTE: Average in-station handling time (HT) will be computed for originated
                             messages as time of file (TOF) to time of transmission (TOT).

         (3) Speed of service objective for each precedence is as follows:

         PRECEDENCE                 THRESHOLDS (IAW AFR 700-7)

         FLASH (ZZ)                 As fast as possible (within 10 minutes of receipt)
         IMMEDIATE (OO)             Within 30 minutes of receipt
         PRIORITY (PP)              Within 180 minutes of receipt
         ROUTINE (RR)               Within 360 minutes of receipt

        (4) Other record comm data may be required to assist the AFFOR/A6 staff in
preparing briefings, statistical trend charts, etc.

     h. Physical Protection and Inspection of Secure Areas. When operating a deployed tactical MPF van, the NCOIC or
OIC will designate person(s) on each shift to perform an inspection of the secure areas. The person will inspect all
vulnerable areas to detect any clandestine surveillance devices. Document this inspection and the inspector’s name on the
DD Form 1753, Master Station Log, and retain the log IAW MAJCOM disposition instructions.

      i. Master Station Log Maintenance. All facility supervisors are strongly encouraged to keep very accurate and
explicit records of events that occur regarding their facility and its operation. Lack of precise details regarding outages,
interruptions, equipment problems, etc., has necessitated trying to locate off-duty operators and supervisors. When in
doubt, document. Entries in the logs must clearly show name(s) of person, place, exact times, circuit number (if
applicable), and brief narrative of events.

5. CUSTOMER EDUCATION. Operators in tactical MPFs frequently encounter problems processing messages that are
improperly prepared and/or handled by the customer. Improperly prepared messages contribute to bottlenecks and to
messages being delayed. Some errors commonly committed by originators and typists are: lines of text exceeds 69
characters and spaces, FLASH messages that contain more than 100 words in length, incomplete addressee elements,
originators hold several messages and deliver in bulk to the MPFs, messages not assigned precedence, etc. Compliance
with the following information will help in preventing and eliminating some of the problems encountered by MPF
operators.

      a. Precedence. Some originators assign IMMEDIATE and PRIORITY precedence to routine administrative type
messages. Such abuse of the precedence system causes the message to compete with urgent ones that warrant such
precedence. Originators must refrain from using IMMEDIATE and PRIORITY precedence on routine messages. In
addition, originators should be brief and concise in message text. flash and IMMEDIATE messages should not exceed 100
words. Keep essential information within 100 words, and extract the non-essential information, and send it by ROUTINE
precedence message.

      b. AIG Messages. If participants are going to use an AIG on messages addressed to a tactical MPF, they must
provide the intended MPFs with a list of the addressees contained in the AIG. Otherwise, the MPF will not know to whom
to address outgoing messages or deliver incoming messages. Avoid using AIGs not designated.

      c. Minimize. If you are notified that MINIMIZE is in effect for record communications, do the following: (1)
Review and comply with ACP 121 US Sup 1(e) and 2. Review messages to be released. Are they absolutely necessary to
exercise support during the crisis situation? Can messages be sent by courier or mail instead of electrical transmission?

      d. Special Category (SPECAT). A SPECAT designated message is a classified message identified with a special
project or subject. The SPECAT designator identifies the message as requiring special handling beyond that given to it
because of its security classification. Only personnel in the MPF, administration, and user channels who are properly
cleared and authorized access may handle and view SPECAT designated messages. Direct processing of SPECAT messages
between the releasing or distribution office and the MPF or between the MPF and the addressees is required unless local
conditions call for intermediate handling. Personnel at such intermediate points must be cleared and authorized access to
handle the SPECAT. MPFs have a special access list of personnel who may sign for SPECAT messages. The list will
identify the specific SPECAT designator or code word they are authorized to release or receipt for.
      e. Date-Time-Group Assignment. FLASH precedence messages will be delivered to the MPF as fast as possible after
assignment of the date-time-group (DTG), and IMMEDIATE precedence delivered within 22 minutes. PRIORITY and
ROUTINE messages will be delivered to the MPF within three and six hours, respectively, of the DTG.

     f. Message Preparation Requirements. Whenever possible, messages should be delivered to the MPF on a SARAH
LITE message disk. For a paper message delivered on DD Form 173, the message preparer should:

         (1) Use upper case for all alpha characters.

         (2) Double space all lines.

         (3) Start each line against the left margin and not exceed 69 characters and spaces per line.

         (4) Limit characters in address elements to 45 characters and spaces.

      g. Classification. On paper copy messages, stamp/print the security classification at the top and bottom of each page
of the DD Form 173. If the message is unclassified, UNCLASSIFIED may be typed in the required spaces.

      h. Punctuation. Use punctuation only when necessary for meaning. Do not use punctuation in the address portion of
the message. For punctuation other than the symbols shown in the referenced regulation, use words. Due to teleprinter
limitations, not all punctuation symbols can be electrically transmitted.

      i. Message Bulk File. Bulk filing is a major problem to all MPFs. It is caused by units/activities not delivering their
messages to the MPF as they are drafted and released throughout the day, but holding them for delivery until the end of the
day. Each originator usually feels that his few messages really don’t contribute to the problem; however, when several
offices bulk file, a problem at the MPF can easily occur. The releaser will check each message to make sure it complies
with AFR 700-7. He will ensure prompt release of the message and also seek prompt appropriate delivery of the message to
the MPF. This will ensure MPF’s workload is spread as evenly as possible throughout the business day. Avoid
accumulating and delivering messages for processing at the close of the business day.

6. Receipt for Messages.

     a. To receipt for incoming messages, each staff agency will provide their servicing communications center or
message processing facility (MPF) a letter which includes the following information:

         (1) Name of staff agency/organization.

         (2) Instructions for notification on PRIORITY and above precedence messages.

         (3) Telephone numbers to call for messages requiring notification.

         (4) A list of personnel authorized to receipt for messages up to and including the classification specified.

      b. The MPF will provide telephonic notification to the staff agency’s distribution office. It will be the responsibility
of the distribution office to arrange for message pickup and to make further distribution to action/information offices within
the unit/directorate.

5.    During initial stages of a deployment, sites will be linked together with UHF TACSAT and multi-channel SHF
SATCOM systems. Typical UHF TACSAT nets are listed in tab 2 of this appendix. The SHF SATCOM terminals will be
linked in accordance with traditional Theater Air Control System concepts. In accordance with the Concepts of Operations
for the General Purpose Numbered Air Force Air Operations Center (AOC), the Ground Theater Air Control System, and
the Theater Air Base (TAB) communications, the SHF satellite network will be directly or indirectly linked with the
Langley AFB Reach Back station. The AOC, Air Support Operations Center (ASOC), Control and Reporting Center
(CRC), and Control and Reporting Element (CRE) units will link together in the traditional, ground theater air control
system configuration. The AOC will also be linked to the TAB locations. Initially, wings will deploy forward to a tactical
air base with their own wing initial communications package (WICP). If operations evolve to a sustaining mode, then
combat communications squadrons will deploy C4I systems to augment/replace these initial WICP C4I systems. The
following SHF SATCOM network diagrams typify the initial and sustaining SHF networks needed to support deployed AF
operations; changes will be published to meet the current/evolving situation upon implementation of this plan.

APPENDIX 6 TO ANNEX K TO COMUSAFE OPLAN 4127-93 (U)
VIDEO TELECONFERENCING (VTC) AND COMMUNICATIONS REQUIREMENTS (U)

1. ( ) GENERAL. VTC system managers and major functional users must identify their requirements for deployed VTC in
order to ensure communications systems are capable of supporting the requirements.

    a. () Survey. The video telecommunications requirements process begins with the implementer developing and
distributing a requirements survey.
       The survey should contain the following information:
       - Point of contact (Name, Office, Office, Address, and Telephone Number).
       - Requirement purpose or mission supported
       - Applications (VTC, distance learning, or combination of these).
       - Identify each organization involved in this requirement (Office, Agency, Activity).
       - System security level (Source sensitive, S, TS, SCI high).
       - Modes of operation (two-way video/two-way audio, one-way video/two-way audio, one-way video/one-way audio).
       - System interaction (point-to-point or multipoint).
       - Bandwidth or transmission speed required (broadcast quality-3.3Mbps, 1.5 Mbps, 768 kbps, 384 kbps, 112/128 kbps,
56 kbps).
       - System configuration (studio, portable (roll about/deployable), desktop).

   b. () Feedback. The feedback from this survey will assist the requester in developing a concept of operations
(CONOPs), inclusive of the following:
      - Situation- Introduction, scope, general tasks.
      - Execution- How will the system (s) be used, system locations, fixed or deployable systems, operations specifics,
operation requirements, training requirements, technical requirements, compatibility with existing networks, and
compliance with standards.
      - Administration and Logistics- Logistics support and manpower.
      - Command and Control (C2) - What organization and who in it will provide C2. Common user systems will be
deployed and used in lieu of discrete systems when security and operational considerations permit.

2. ( ) COMMON-USER VTC SYSTEMS. Common user systems provide a secure, acceptable image quality conferencing
capability for most VTC users at deployed locations. The common-user approach permits the deployed commander to
conserve airlift by deploying a single terminal. Communications bandwidth is conserved by dynamic allocation of
bandwidth to the common-user system when conferences are in progress. See Tab A for concept of operations, multipoint
capabilities, and communications requirements.

3. ( ) COMMAND AND CONTROL (C2) AND OPERATIONS VTC SYSTEMS. C2 VTC systems are deployed when
common user systems are expected to be unsuitable or inadequate to support the mission. An example of this include air
operations centers. See Tab B (OPR: Air Force Component Command SC; OCR: DO).

operations and communications requirements in Tab C (OPR: AFCC IN).

5. ( ) TELEMEDICINE VTC. Telemedicine concept and communications requirements may be derived from the joint
theater medical support plan, but should include deploying systems planned to support base-level requirements. Identify
concept and communications support requirements in Tab D (OPR: AFCC SG).

3. ( ) CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS. State how the system will be used in the field, primary users and anticipated
frequency, and whether point-to-point or multipoint conferences will be held. Theater-level planners should include
concept for multipoint conference control. State whether the system will be interconnected with the DOD DCTN system or
other CONUS network. State who will operate and maintain the systems. Provide sufficient detail to enable subordinate
and supporting units to plan interconnectivity.

4. ( ) SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS. State who will provide the terminal equipment for the VTC capability, whether the
equipment is standards-compliant. If a specific proprietary algorithm compatibility is needed to provide acceptable picture
quality with compatible systems over limited bandwidth, identify the algorithm.

5. ( ) CONNECTIVITY REQUIREMENTS. State connectivity requirements in the chart below so communications
planners can design long-haul circuits.

       a. ( ) Concept of Operations. State the general concept of space activities required in support of the forces
assigned to the OPLAN. Describe briefly how the space operations fit into the entire operation. Place particular emphasis
on those aspects of the basic plan that establish space requirements and that affect space capabilities and limitations.

       b     ( ) Tasks and Responsibilities. In separate numbered subparagraphs assign individual tasks and
responsibilities to each applicable component, other subdivision of the force, or agencies that provide support to the plan.
Each of the tasks should be a concise statement of the mission to be performed in further planning or execution of the
overall plan. These task assignments should be of sufficient detail to insure that all elements essential to the concept of the
operation are described properly.

       c. ( )     Coordinating Instructions. Provide necessary guidance common to two or more components, subdivisions
or agencies.

       d. ( ) Space Activities. Identify space activities required to support the OPLAN. Include the following specific
areas as applicable.

            (1) ( ) Communication. Space communications channels which would aid in the exercise of command and
control of military forces. Reference may be made to Annex K, Command and Control Systems for amplifying information.

           (2) ( ) Meteorological and Oceanographic. Meteorologic, oceanographic, geodetic, and other
environmental support information provided by space assets which might affect surface, air, or space activities or assets.
Detailed weather operations should be described in Annex H, Weather Operations.


            (3) ( ) Navigation. Navigational capabilities that would aid the transit of ships, aircraft, personnel or
spacecraft and the determination of course and distance traveled or position location.

            (4) ( ) Surveillance. Surveillance and/or reconnaissance information pertaining to friendly and/or enemy
forces whether performed by space, air or surface assets in or external to the area of operations which would aid in
operations and force positioning.

             (5) ( ) Tactical Warning. Notification of enemy ballistic missile or space weapon attacks which can be
evaluated from available sensor and intelligence sources and could affect the area of operation. Reference may be made to
Annex B, Intelligence for amplifying information.

             (6) ( ) Space Control. Space related activities whether performed by space, air, or surface assets that ensure
friendly forces and deny enemy forces the unrestricted use of space and space assets.

            (7) ( ) Nuclear Detonation. Notification of detected nuclear detonations which might affect the operation
and require evaluation as to yield and location. Reference may be made to Annex B, Intelligence for amplifying
information.

            (8) ( ) Friendly Missile Impact. Notification of friendly ballistic missile launches that might affect the area
of operations and would require warning and predicted impact prior to launch.

             (9) ( ) Enemy Space Activity. Notification of space related activities undertaken by the enemy that would
affect friendly action in the area of operations. These could include notice of enemy reconnaissance of friendly forces by
space assets, such as satellites and manned space stations, which would aid in providing information to the enemy; and/or
hostile space activities taken by the enemy that deny unrestricted friendly access to space, deny the full capabilities of
friendly space assets or restrict friendly surface or air resources required by these space assets. Reference may be made to
Annex B, Intelligence for amplifying information.

4.      ( ) ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS. Provide broad guidance concerning administrative and logistics
support for space operations. Support of mobile or fixed space assets within the theater of operations will be addressed here
or references made to the appropriate annex where this information is available. Reference to Annex D or pertinent
command directives may suffice.


5.     ( ) COMMAND AND SIGNAL. Indicate the difference, if any, between the command channels for the conduct of
space activities and the command relationships established in Annex J. If applicable, state requirements for augmentation
of appropriate headquarters with space operations personnel. Reference should be made to the appropriate section of Annex
J. Provide pertinent extracts of information included in Annex K or the basic plan for the support of space activities.

3.     ()   EXECUTION

       a. ( ) Concept of Operations. Describe in general terms how the medical logistics support is organized and
provided throughout the theater; address medical supply and resupply, biomedical equipment maintenance, and optical
fabrication. Outline the surgeon’s role in the medical logistics support system. Delineate how allocation or cross-leveling of
medical material is accomplished. If a single integrated medical logistics manager concept is operative, describe how it will
support the operation. In addition, if the command has agreements to purchase medical materiel locally, describe the types
of items that could be acquired and assess the reliability of the agreement.

        b. ( ) Tasks. Components’ tasks should include providing for and effectively employing medical materiel
support units to meet their own or joint missions, submitting resupply requests in a timely manner in accordance with
established procedures, and keeping the surgeon apprised of any significant materiel shortfalls. Supporting commands
should be tasked for necessary resupply or transportation support.

        c. ( ) Coordinating Instructions. State that the surgeon should maintain close ongoing contact with those
activities having command over medical materiel support units to obtain up-to-date information on the status of Class 8A
sustainability. Also, describe the need to keep combat commanders informed of medical sustainability posture and what
measures should and are being instituted to alleviate them. Liaison with airlifters and ground transportation agencies may
also be required to arrange a higher priority for distribution of medical materiel. Ongoing coordination with theater
logisticians to ensure adequate priority for medical requisitions is essential.

        c. ( ) Facilities. State in general terms what medical logistics facilities are in-place. Outline generally what
medical logistics units are introduced early in the deployment process to augment existing resources. Also describe how the
overall medical logistics capabilities will be phased into and positioned throughout the theater. Refer to Tab A for locations
of units.

       d. ( ) Policy. Outline the command policies for provision of medical materiel support, minimum essential
accompanying supplies for deploying troops and priorities for use of in-theater medical materiel stocks. Discuss how
requests for CONUS resupply will be submitted. Refer to Annex D for policies on handling and use of captured enemy
medical materiel, theater stockage objectives, and abandonment of materiel; if the medical policy differs, so state--along
with the supporting rationale.

4.     ()   ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS

       a. ( ) Medical Materiel Sustainability Assessment. Describe briefly, as a best estimate, the number of days that
the combat command can be supported with existing theater stocks. Address what effect CONUS resupply will have on
medical sustainability. Identify any critical medical items that are in extremely short supply. Refer to Tab B for a more
detailed assessment of CONUS resupply availability.

      b. ( ) Administration. Identify any reporting and administrative support requirements.

5.    ()   COMMAND AND SIGNAL

       a. ( ) Command Relationships. Outline the chain of command for all theater medical logistics support units;
regional breakouts may be required.

      b. ( ) C3 Systems. Specify by what mode (voice, teletype, MILSTRIP) and in what priority requisitions will be
submitted. Delineate command guidance on level of classification.

       FORMAT AND CONTENT OF CONPLANS (with and without TPFDD) AND FUNCTIONAL PLANS

D1. Purpose. JOPES, Volume II, specifies the format for unified and specified command plans tasked by the JSCP. The
format in this enclosure was derived from the JOPES format and contains the Air Force unique planning information
needed in addition to the basic joint planning format. Air Force supporting command plans will adhere to the basic format
used by the unified command it supports, since JOPES may change out of cycle with this publication. This enclosure
illustrates each element of a CONPLAN or Functional Plan and the letter of transmittal and other administrative details
used to prepare and transmit the plans. A supplement may be used to augment a CONPLAN, Functional Plan, or order of a
higher headquarters, but not to modify, change, or nullify any policy, procedure, or instruction in the basic document.

D2. CONPLAN. A CONPLAN (without a TPFDD) is an operation plan in an abbreviated format that would require
considerable expansion or alteration to convert it into an OPLAN, campaign plan, or OPORD. A CONPLAN contains the
CINC’s strategic concept, Annexes A through D and K, and those additional annexes and appendixes deemed necessary by
the CINC to complete planning. When included, prepare an annex in the same format prescribed for an OPLAN in
Enclosure C of this manual. Include only the detail believed necessary. CONPLANs are generally developed to meet
common type missions that may develop rapidly and require implementation of like action but under markedly different
circumstances (for example, noncombatant evacuation operations). Unless specified in the JSCP, detailed support
requirements are not calculated and TPFDD files are not prepared. These conditions require planning associated with the
warfighting and employment aspects of the plan for a clear understanding of the CINC’s concept of operations. Similar to
OPLANs; phasing, centers of gravity, and commander’s intent enhance a clear understanding of the forces required and
when they have to be deployed to achieve the national objective. A CONPLAN may also be required where the primary
purpose is force movement planning in support of alliances.

D3. CONPLAN with TPFDD. A CONPLAN with TPFDD is the same as a CONPLAN except that it requires more
detailed planning for phased deployment of forces. Detailed planning may be required to support a contingency of
compelling interest and critical to national security but is not likely to occur in the near term.

D4. Functional Plan. Prepare a functional plan using the same format as a CONPLAN without TPFDD. Functional
plans involve the conduct of military operations in a peacetime or permissive environment. These plans are developed for
specific functions or discrete tasks (for example, nuclear weapon recovery or evacuation, logistics, communications, or
continuity of operations) but may be developed to address functional peacetime operations such as disaster relief,
humanitarian assistance, peacekeeping, or counternarcotics.

D5. Model. A CONPLAN is a broad outline of how an assigned mission is to be carried out. Required annexes are
prepared in the same format as annexes for an OPLAN, but only in the detail considered necessary. It includes:

D5.1. All normal elements of an OPLAN with the mission, situation, and concept of operations being fully developed. Other
elements are in summary form. The letter of transmittal and other administrative matters are also the same as for an
OPLAN.

D5.2. A summary of mobility and logistic support requirements.

D5.3. Summaries of existing major constraints concerning forces, movement, or logistic support which would significantly
affect executing the plan.

PLAN SUMMARY (U)

1.     ( ) PURPOSE. Provide a concise description of the purpose to be achieved by implementing the plan. Refer to the
task assignment in the JSCP or other directive that the CONPLAN fulfills. If this is a supporting plan, indicate the plan it
supports including, when applicable, a plan prepared by commanders of allied forces.

2.     ()   CONDITIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION

       a.   ()    Summarize the politico-military situation in which execution of the plan should be considered.

        b. ( ) Include a statement substantially as follows. For example, "This summary provides military decision
makers a brief recapitulation of the major aspects of this plan. It is based on planning factors and estimates available at the
time of preparation, and is subject to modification in the context of a specific contingency. (For CONPLANs without
TPFDDs include the following: Due to the conceptual nature of this plan, detailed time-phased force deployment data may
not be available. Detailed deployment information will be developed based on the current situation at the earliest
opportunity in a developing crisis, preferably during situation development.) The information herein should be reviewed
and, if necessary, updated before a course of action (COA) is adopted in a given situation.. The options and phases outlined
in this CONPLAN are intended to serve as a departure point for detailed planning if the situation requires.”

       c.   ()    Summarize any legal and environmental considerations that could impact on plan implementation.

3.     ()   OPERATIONS TO BE CONDUCTED

     a. ( ) Force Requirements. Summarize the major combat force requirements in terms of assigned forces and
augmentations required from other sources.

        b. ( ) Preconflict Measures. Summarize the preconflict measures to be considered for implementation upon
receipt of strategic warning and prior to M- and D-day. Include planning for activities such as PSYOP, reconnaissance,
selected deployments, and intelligence when these actions are considered essential to accomplish the mission.

                                                                        CLASSIFIED BY:

       c. ( ) Deployment. Summarize the intertheater and intratheater movements of forces required to place the
necessary combat forces in the area of operations. When applicable, include deployments and deception activities that
would be carried out before full implementation of the plan.

        d. ( ) Employment. Indicate the general nature of combat operations to be conducted, including PSYOP, theater
or tactical nuclear operations, C2W and Special Technical Operations (STO). Discuss these operations in the context of the
following five phases of operations: (a) prehostilities, (b) lodgment, (c) decisive combat and stabilization, (d) follow
through, and (e) posthostilities and redeployment. Include in this discussion a summary of the Commander’s intent for
each phase. This discussion should contain a concise expression of the desired end state for each phase. It may include
haw postures of units at each end state facilitates transition to the next phase. A discussion of the Commander’s estimate of
the enemy’s intent may also be included. The Commander’s intent is not, however, a summary of the concept of operations.

      e. ( ) Supporting Plans. List any requirements for supporting plans to be prepared by subordinate and
supporting commands or agencies.

4.       ()   ASSUMPTIONS. List all assumptions. Include the degree of mobilization assumed.

5.       ()   OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS. List major factors that may impede accomplishing the mission.

6.      ( ) TIME TO COMMENCE EFFECTIVE OPERATIONS. Include a table showing the required time-phased,
incremental buildup of combat forces in the objective area. Clearly indicate in the table which combat forces would have to
be available in the area of operations could begin. Also, show in the table the amount of time that would elapse from the
time an order to implement the plan was issued until each significant level of combat force required by the plan could begin
effective operations in the objective area. Report the lowest level of force as the smallest force increment that could initiate
effective operation. List successively higher force levels up to the maximum level called for in the basic plan. List
assumptions applied in preparing this table that are not specified in the plan. In determining the time to commence
effective operations, consider forces to be deployed or employed to be at normal conditions of readiness, that is, assume no
advance measures are taken. Consider also these and other pertinent timing factors:

         a.   ()   Time required to carry out PSYOP, C2W, and STO as specified in the relevant PSYOP. C2W, and STO
plan..

         b.   ()   Time for preparing and transmitting necessary orders.

3.     ()   EXECUTION

       a. ( ) Concept of Operations. Provide enough detail to convey a clear and complete understanding of how the
operation would be conducted from beginning to end. Include the entire concept of operations in this section.

            (1) ( ) Commander’s Intent. Describe the commander’s overall intent, and intent by phase. Describe the
desired end state. It should be a concise expression of the purpose of each phase of the operation. It may include how the
posture of units at that end state facilitates transition to future operations. It may also include the commander’s assessment
of the enemy commander’s intent. The commander’s intent is not, however, a summary of the concept of operations.


             (2) ( ) General. Indicate that the concept of operations is derived from the Commander's Estimate of the
situation. State in the concept how the commander intends to carry out the mission. Outline this information in the
concept:


                  (a) ( ) Tell which forces are involved, the time phasing of operations, the general nature and purpose
of operations to be conducted, and the interrelated or cross-service support, coordination, and cooperation necessary to
execute the operations successfully..

               (b) ( ) Include an estimate of the level and duration of conflict to provide supporting subordinate
commanders a basis for preparing adequate supporting plans.

                 (c)   ()    To the extent possible, the plan should incorporate the following concepts of joint operation
planning doctrine:

                       1. Commander’s strategic intent and operational focus.

                       2. Orientation on the strategic and operational centers of gravity of the threat.

                       3. Protection of friendly strategic and operational centers of gravity.

A graphic timeline may be used to assist in describing the various options or phases covered in the concept to include items
such as warning and response times, major deployments, and employment phases. The concept should show how the
initiative will be gained, security against enemy actions will be maintained, and superiority and surprise will be achieved..
If appropriate, reference should be made to Annex A for detailed force requirements. Additionally, if commanders
anticipate sustained armed conflict during execution of the plan, the CONOPS should outline the synchronized employment
of air, land, maritime, space, special operations, PSYOP, and C2W operations in a joint campaign. Acknowledging that
details of campaigns cannot be determined before armed conflict, provide sufficient detail to guide force structure,
organization, and development, and the planning and conduct of preconflict operations.

             (3) ( ) CONPLAN Structure. For plans addressing situations that could involve armed conflict, the concept
of operations will include a separate description for each phase of the operation. These phases should include, as
applicable, the following: (a) Prehostilities, (b) Lodgment, (c) Decisive combat and stabilization, (d) Follow Through,
(e) Posthostilities and Redeployment


             (4) ( ) Deployment. . Summarize the requirements to deploy forces from their normal peacetime locations
to the area of operations. Include:

                  (a) ( ) Deployments carried out within the command area, as well as deployments of augmentation
forces, and especially anticipatory deployments that may be required to implement and support the plan when directed.

                 (b)   ()   Deployment of rapid reaction forces as a partial implementation of the plan.

                 (c)   ()   Any deception measures needed to provide security, by misleading the enemy and achieving
surprise.

                 (d) ( )    A graphic timeline may be used to assist in describing the various options and phases covered.

            (5) ( ) Employment. Describe how the deployed forces are to be tactically employed in each of the phases
contained in CONPLAN structure listed above to include the commander’s intent for each phase. Clearly outline plans for
using nuclear and chemical munitions or agents, if any. Refer to respective appendices of Annex C for: plans for
conducting US Air Force Special Operations; tactical electronic warfare operations; deception operations, PSYOP, SAR,
reconnaissance, and nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) defense operations.

       b. ( ) Tasks. In separate subparagraphs, assign tasks to each subordinate element which would participate in
the operation. Include requirements for preparing supporting plans and for coordinating interservice support.

of the command) that are required for proper coordination of the operation and are not included elsewhere. In particular,
include terms pertaining to the timing of execution and deployments, and any other operational terms not defined elsewhere
in the plan or in joint publications.

        d. ( ) Operational Constraints. In the final subparagraph, list any operational constraints that would adversely
affect accomplishing the mission and state the impact of each.

4.     ( ) ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS. Estimate the logistics and administrative requirements to support the
plan and constraints expected to exist in the support system. Identify and request, as appropriate, the types of support
required from sources outside the originating command.

                                           THE COMMANDER’S ESTIMATE

E1. Purpose. The Commander’s Estimate, submitted by the supported CINC in response to a CJCS WARNING ORDER,
provides the Chairman with time-sensitive information for consideration by the NCA in meeting a crisis situation.
Essentially, it reflects the supported CINC’s analysis of the various courses of action (COAs) that may be used to accomplish
the assigned mission and contains recommendations as to the best COA. Although the estimate process at the supported
CINC level may involve a complete, detailed estimate by the supported commander, the estimate submitted to the CJCS will
normally be a greatly abbreviated version providing only that information essential to the NCA and CJCS in arriving at a
decision to meet a crisis.

E.2. Crisis Action Planning. During crisis action planning, the supported CINC may choose an existing plan as a primary
reference for COAs as well as request inputs from his staff and component commanders. Because of the short suspense for
inputs, the supported CINC puts out a Commander’s Evaluation Request message in which he summarizes the situation and
his COA planning parameters. The component commanders reply via an OPREP-1 Component’s Evaluation Response
message.

E.3. Deliberate Planning Process. Joint Pub 1-02 defines the Commander’s Estimate (of the Situation) as "a logical
process of reasoning by which a commander considers all the circumstances affecting the military situation and arrives at a
decision as to a course of action to be taken to accomplish the mission." In deliberate planning, it is this document that
clearly states the CINC’s decision and summarizes the rationale for that decision. The Commander's Estimate becomes a
tool to communicate valuable guidance from the CINC to the staff and subordinate commanders. This is not a document to
convince the reader of the wisdom of the selected COA; the CINC has already selected the COA to be developed into a
concept of operations. Rather, it is a summary of the CINC's thought process. As such, it is a valuable planning tool for the
staff and subordinate commanders. The staffs use this guidance to begin work on developing the staff estimates which will
be used to form the Concept of Operations for the tasked OPLAN or CONPLAN.

       a. ( ) Considerations Affecting the Possible Courses of Action. Determine and analyze factors which will
influence the choice of a course of action, and any factors that affect the capabilities of friendly or enemy forces. Consider
these and other pertinent factors. Under each, include a statement of fact (or an assumption), and a deduction of its
probable influence on enemy or friendly actions:

            (1) ( )    Military Geography

                  (a) ( ) Characteristics of the Area of Operations

                        1. ( ) Topography. Factors of relief and drainage, vegetation, surface materials, and similar
characteristics should be given consideration as they affect such elements of an operation as observation, maneuver, fire
support, concealment, cover, air and surface movement, lines of communications, avenues of approach, key terrain, nuclear
and C-B weapons employment, electronic emissions of all types, and unconventional, psychological, and other significant
activities.

                      2. ( ) Hydrography. Included after this heading are the characteristics of offshore sea areas,
approaches to the beaches, currents, tides, the beaches themselves, ports, docks, and similar maritime considerations.

                        3. ( ) Climate and Weather. Extremes of temperature, wind velocities, cloud cover, visibility,
precipitation, and other such factors that can affect military operations must be determined and presented. Sunrise, sunset,
and twilight data are normally given in this subparagraph.

                   (b) ( ) Transportation. Characteristics of roads, railways, inland waterways, and airfields, including
such factors as size, capacity, conditions, and other facts that affect enemy capabilities and friendly COA, are given here.

                  (c) ( ) Telecommunications. Radio, cable, land-line, and other communications facilities in the area
of operations that might aid in the exercise of command over military forces are listed. Facilities considered by this
subparagraph are not those in the organic capability of the opposing forces, but rather those present in the area.

                  (d) ( ) Politics. Political factors include such considerations in political stability, alliances, relations
with other countries, aspects of international law, control over subversion and dissidence, and similar factors that may
influence selection of a COA. Neutrality or non-neutrality of neighboring states in the area is often listed here.

                  (e) ( ) Economics. Economic factors include the organization of the economy and sometimes its
mobilization capacity; the industrial base of the antagonists to support hostilities, finance, foreign trade; and similar
influences as they affect selection of a COA.

                  (f) ( ) Sociology. Social conditions run a wide range from the psychological ability of the populace to
withstand the rigors of war to health and sanitation conditions in the area of operations. Language, social institutions and
attitudes, and similar factors that may affect selection of a COA must be considered.

                   (g) ( ) Science and Technology. Although little immediate military impact may result from the state
of science and technology in a target area, the long-range effects of such factors as technical skill level of the population and
scientific and technical resources in manpower and facilities should be considered in cases where they may affect the choice
of a COA.

                       1. ( ) Strength. Give number and size of enemy units committed and those available for
reinforcement in the area. This is not intended to be a tabulation of numbers of aircraft, ships, missiles, or other military
weaponry. Rather, it is a study of what strength the enemy commander can bring to bear in the area in terms of ground
units committed and reinforcing, aircraft sortie rates, missile delivery rates, unconventional, psychological, and other
strengths the commander thinks may affect the balance of power.

                       2. ( ) Composition. This includes order of battle of major enemy combat formations, equivalent
strengths of enemy and friendly units, and major weapons systems and armaments in the enemy arsenal and their
operational characteristics.

                      3. ( ) Location and Disposition. Geographical location of enemy units, fire support elements,
command and control facilities, air, naval, and missile forces, and other combat power in or deployable to the area of
operations are shown here.

                        4. ( ) Reinforcements. Estimate the enemy reinforcement capabilities that can influence the
battle in the area under consideration. This study should include ground, air, naval and missile forces; nuclear, and other
advanced weapon systems; and an estimate of the relative capacity to move these forces about, to, and in the battle area.

                        5. ( ) Logistics. This subparagraph summarizes enemy ability to support the capabilities with
which they have been credited and included such considerations as supply, maintenance, hospitalization and evacuation,
transportation, labor, construction, and other essential logistic means. Broadly speaking, it is a feasibility test for enemy
capabilities.

                      6. ( ) Time and Space Factors. Estimate where and when initial forces and reinforcements can
be deployed and employed. Such a study will normally include distances and travel times by land, sea, and air from major
bases or mounting areas into the battle area.

                        7. ( ) Combat Efficiency. This subparagraph is an estimate of enemy state of training,

PLAN DESIGNATION SHORT TITLE (U)
CHAPLAIN ESTIMATE OF THE SITUATION (U)

()     REFERENCES: List maps, charts, and relevant documents.

1.     ( ) MISSION. State the operational mission of the command as a whole, and not responsibilities of the Chaplain
Service functional area.

2.     ( ) SITUATION AND COURSE OF ACTION. Planners should use this paragraph to discuss the present situation
and factors that may affect possible courses of action. For example, these and other relevant topics should be discussed:

       a. ( ) Proposed Courses of Action. All courses of action being considered by the commander should be obtained
from the commander’s staff element responsible for plans and operations. Since the chaplain’s estimate must address the
commander’s possible courses of action, several options may be presented.

       b. ( ) Characteristics of the Proposed Area of Operations. Climate, weather, environment, topography, etc.,
often affect the morale of personnel and, in turn, chaplain manpower and equipment requirements.

       c. ( ) Assumptions. The planner should describe each assumption pertinent to the chaplain support
requirements for each course of action. These assumptions should be stated as facts.

        d. ( ) Strength to be Supported. The planner must determine the time-phased strength to be supported. Using
this strength, the planner must then determine the location of chaplains to provide ministry to casualties and operational
and support personnel. The location of Air Force personnel and number of work units determine chaplain support
requirements.

3.      ( ) CHAPLAIN SUPPORT ANALYSIS. The data described in paragraphs 1 and 2 are analyzed to determine how
best to provide chaplain support of the mission. When the analysis is developed, it should show the relative merits of each
course of action with respect to requirements, availability, and limiting factors.


                                                                      CLASSIFIED BY:

                                                                            DECLASSIFY ON:

      a. ( ) Chaplain Locations. Each requirement for a course of action should be analyzed for location of all forces,
medical units, and the availability of chaplain coverage furnished by both US and friendly forces.

            (1) ( )    Force locations

            (2) ( )    Type of Facility and Requirements

            (3) ( )    Friendly chaplain coverage

            (4) ( )    Limiting factors

       b. ( ) Supply Aspects. The logistical needs for each chaplain support site are determined through planner
consideration of three types of location: a permanent support element with a large concentration of forces, the small site
used only as an operational base for site coverage, and bare base operation. In this section, the planner should explain how
supplies and equipment are made available for each course of action.

            (1) ( )    Type of installations or operations requiring support

            (2) ( )    Availability of chaplain supplies and equipment

            (3) ( )    Resupply

            (4) ( )    Limiting factors

       c. ( ) Transportation. This section addresses transportation based on the planner’s thorough knowledge of the
availability of chaplain-assigned vehicles and air support for site visitation.

            (1) ( )    Chaplain staging requirements

            (2) ( )    Air support

            (3) ( )    Limiting factors

       d.   ()   Other Chaplain Support Furnished by Friendly Forces

        e. ( ) Other Limiting Factors. This key section address limitations on chaplain support based on the availability
of the chaplain personnel, faith group requirements, characteristics of area of operations, and time-phased personnel
strength. Any limiting factors not previously discussed that would affect the proposed courses of action should be
presented.

4.      ( ) COMPARISONS OF COURSES OF ACTION. Based on the analysis performed as described in paragraph 3,
this section compares the chaplain support requirements for each course of action.

5.     ( ) CONCLUSIONS. This part of the estimate is used to state the course of action recommended as "best" from
the chaplain’s viewpoint. this section is also used to list all major chaplain support deficiencies that must receive the
commander’s attention and actions needed to correct them.

to ensure the necessary capability is attained. This requires extensive preplanning and coordination with the operations
planners and other support planners. Comptroller planners must have or gain extensive knowledge of the plan’s basic
operational assumptions and requirements. Without assured combat support and combat service support of committed
forces, no combat operation can be sustained.
