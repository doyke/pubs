                                        RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Headquarters United States Air Force. HQ USAF/XOF determines how security forces members
conduct criminal investigations throughout the Air Force.

1.2. Headquarters Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI). HQ AFOSI develops guide-
lines on investigative jurisdiction within the US Air Force. It also manages the USAF Polygraph Program
and provides guidance on the Joint Drug Enforcement Team (JDET) concept.

1.3. Headquarters Air Force Security Forces Center ( HQ AFSFC). HQ AFSFC provides Air Force
security forces commanders with guidance on investigative matters.
    1.3.1. HQ AFSFC compiles information reportable under DoD Directive 5400.12, Obtaining Infor-
    mation from Financial Institutions, and forwards this information annually to SAF/IGX.

1.4. Installation Chief of Security Forces (CSF). The CSF will establish a security forces investiga-
tions section within their squadron to handle incidents and/or crimes as delineated in Attachment 2,
AFOSI and security forces investigative matrix, as established by AFI 71-101, Volume I, Criminal Inves-
tigations. The matrix is to be used as a guideline for decision makers and is not intended to remove dis-
cretionary authority from the CSF or AFOSI commander.

                                               Chapter 2

                       ESTABLISHING AN INVESTIGATION PROGRAM

2.1. Investigative Jurisdiction. Security forces members investigate all crimes, offenses or incidents
falling within their investigative jurisdiction as set forth in Attachment 2 and AFI 71-101, Volume I.
These cases normally do not involve coordination with federal law enforcement agencies and other than
local or host nation forces. Security forces may close out cases AFOSI determines do not warrant further
AFOSI investigation.
   2.1.1. When authorized, security forces provide investigative assistance to AFOSI. The AFOSI
   detachment commander or special agent in charge and CSF jointly make determinations of need.
   2.1.2. Installation CSFs coordinate requests from AFOSI to pick up an ongoing security forces inves-
   tigation. Security forces close out and transfer all case file information and evidence to AFOSI once
   they accept investigative responsibility.

2.2. Credentials. The CSF issues an AF Form 688, Security Forces Investigator Credential, to secu-
rity forces investigators in the rank of senior airman (or civilian equivalent) or above.
   2.2.1. Issue credentials to the graduates of the Military Police Investigator Course, AFOSI Special
   Investigators Course or of an overseas US Army Major Command Military Police Investigators
   Course.
   2.2.2. The CSF may issue credentials to security forces members who the CSF believes have the nec-
   essary technical expertise, formal education and training. Note: In the absence of a qualified investi-
   gator, the CSF may issue credentials to persons with less experience or part-time investigators,
   provided the number of credentials issued does not exceed the number of authorized investigators.
   Formal training for these individuals is the goal.
   2.2.2. (AMC) When the CSF issues credentials to unqualified investigators, every effort should be
   made to send the individual to an acceptable school within 18 months of issuance.
   2.2.3. The CSF ensures security forces investigators carry the AF Form 688 in the performance of
   official duties only. Credentials are valid only as long as the holder is performing investigative duties
   within the issuing unit. The credential expiration date should generally not exceed three years from
   date of issue.
       2.2.3.1. Destroy withdrawn credentials upon change of duty status, assignment or station. Docu-
       ment credential destruction on AF Form 310, Document Receipt and Destruction Certificate,
       and maintain the certificate with other AF Form 688 accountability records. Note: The CSF may
       present an investigator his credentials as a change of duty station or retirement memento. When
       done, the commander must render the credentials unserviceable. Marking the credentials in red
       block letters "INVALID" or encasing them in poured acrylic are two options.
       2.2.3.2. Ensure control and protection of blank credential forms against theft and unauthorized
       use.
       2.2.3.2. (AMC) Store unissued credentials in a locked, steel filing cabinet.

2.3. Uniform Wear. Investigators will wear the military uniform with the security police shield while
performing investigative duties. The installation CSF may authorize wear of appropriate civilian clothes
on a case-by-case basis when uniform wear hinders operations. Do not wear the security police shield
with civilian clothes. When authorized to wear civilian clothes, carry the shield clipped to the inside of the
investigator credential holder.
    2.3.1. Air Force civilian employees assigned as investigators wear the DoD police badge in uniform
    and carry (rather than wear) the badge when performing official duties in civilian clothing. When
    wearing civilian clothes, carry the DoD police badge clipped to the inside of the investigator creden-
    tial holder.
    2.3.2. Wear of civilian attire with the security police shield affixed or embroidered is prohibited while
    on duty. Wear of the security police shield negates the purpose and need for wear of civilian attire.

2.4. Arming. Investigators are normally not armed while conducting investigations unless authorized by
the installation CSF. Blanket authorizations to carry concealed firearms are prohibited. Investigator weap-
ons will be stored in the security forces armory. Comply with AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by
Air Force Personnel, when carrying weapons openly or concealed.
2.4. (AMC) Routine wear of a concealed weapon is prohibited. The CSF must specifically authorize the
carrying of a concealed weapon based on the threat to the investigator.

2.5. Reimbursement. Security forces investigators submit an SF 1164, Claim for Reimbursement for
Expenditures on Official Business, for all reimbursable expenses incurred while conducting an official
investigation. Installation CSFs must preapprove reimbursement for expenses incurred while conducting
an investigation.

2.6. Handling Evidence. Installation CSFs appoint evidence custodians in writing. You must positively
identify and strictly account for evidence to assure admissibility for legal proceedings.
    2.6.1. Investigators must:
       2.6.1.1. Complete an AF Form 52, Evidence Tag, as soon as possible after collecting items of
       evidence, thoroughly describing the evidence and identifying each person who has had custody of
       the item. Multiple and varying types of evidence may be consolidated on one AF Form 52 pro-
       vided the evidence is collected by the same person, at the same place, and as part of the same case.
       Multiple AF Forms 52 are used by numbering them consecutively, i.e., 1 of 3, 2 of 3. Ensure main-
       tenance of the chain of custody.
       2.6.1.2. Mark each item of evidence with the time seized, date seized and initials of the person
       seizing the item. Do not mark items of evidence when doing so would reduce the evidentiary or
       financial value of the item. In those cases, place the item in a sealed bag or container and mark the
       bag or container with the time and date seized and initials of the person seizing the item.
       2.6.1.2. (AMC) When sealing evidence in bags or containers, ensure ID marking appears on both
       the seal/tape and the container (ID should overlap seal/tape and container so the seal/tape could
       not be removed without disturbing the ID mark).
       2.6.1.3. Release evidence to the evidence custodian and/or secure it as soon as practical.
AFI31-206_AMCSUP1_INT 1 AUGUST 2002                                                                   7


     2.6.1.4. Record all evidence in ink in a permanently bound evidence log with consecutively num-
     bered pages. Do not remove pages from the log or erase entries. Do not use correction fluids or
     correction tape. Draw a line through mistakes and initial them.
     2.6.1.4. (AMC) Use a permanently bound logbook with consecutively numbered pages to record
     property transactions. Do not remove pages from the log. Property is entered into the log when
     received by the property custodian and entries are made in the log for each subsequent transaction,
     including final disposition. All entries must be in ink. Correct errors by lining through the error
     and initialing the change. Recommended format for logbooks is:

     Item number
     Report Number
     Date received
     Complainant or Subject
     Seized or obtained from
     Seized or received by
     Tag number
     Description of item
     Location of item; e.g., shelf, bin number
     Transaction date
     Transaction description
     Signature of person accepting or destroying property
     2.6.1.5. Store evidence in lockers, safes or rooms designated solely for that purpose. Designate
     such areas as controlled areas and comply with the requirements of AFI 31-101, The Air Force
     Installation Security Program. Develop procedures to make evidence storage containers or
     rooms accessible only to the evidence custodian(s).
     2.6.1.5. (AMC) As a minimum, ensure your evidence storage rooms meet the following stan-
     dards, in addition to the requirements of AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Pro-
     gram:
        2.6.1.5.1. (Added-AMC) Doors shall be solid hardwood or laminated wood of at least 1 3/
        4-inch thickness. Door hinges shall be located on the interior of the evidence storage room or
        welded, peened or braided to prevent removal.
        2.6.1.5.2. (Added-AMC) Windows and other openings should be kept to a minimum. Win-
        dows should be no larger than the evidence storage lockers. If so, the lockers should be
        lag-bolted to the wall with the bolt heads inside the locking compartment. Windows should be
        covered with blinds and curtains to prevent view of contents from the outside.
        2.6.1.5.3. (Added-AMC) The walls, floor, and roof construction of secure rooms must be of
        permanent construction materials; i.e., plaster, gypsum wallboard, metal panels, hardboard,
        wood, plywood, or other materials offering resistance to, and evidence of unauthorized entry
        into the area. Walls shall be extended to the true ceiling and attached with permanent construc-
        tion materials.

    2.6.1.6. Store firearms and ammunition evidence in approved containers in the security forces
    armory.
    2.6.1.7. Secure controlled substances (other than residue and paraphernalia) stored outside a des-
    ignated evidence room in a GSA-approved Class 5 safe.
    2.6.1.7. (AMC) Secure controlled substances (other than residue and paraphernalia) in a
    GSA-approved Class 5 safe.
       2.6.1.7.1. Weigh controlled substances upon receipt and disposal and record the weight on AF
       Form 52. If the weight is so small as to be negligible, state this on the AF Form 52.
       2.6.1.7.1. (AMC) Weigh evidential or contraband drugs upon receipt and upon release or dis-
       posal. Record the weight on the AF Form 52. The balance scales used for this measurement
       should be calibrated according to the technical orders for that equipment.
       2.6.1.7.2. Storage of drug evidence with military working dog training aids is prohibited.
       2.6.1.7.2. (AMC) The CSF must designate, in writing, drug evidence repositories and primary
       and alternate custodians.
    2.6.1.8. Conduct inventories of all evidence as determined locally, but at least quarterly, and
    inform the CSF in writing of discrepancies. Conduct an inventory when changing evidence custo-
    dians. Document the transfer of custodians in the front of the evidence logbook.
    2.6.1.8. (AMC) Security forces organizations must specify the frequency of property inventories
    in a local operating instruction or regulation. A security forces management representative will
    authenticate the inventory. When conducting the inventory, review written records, to include pre-
    vious audits or source documents against on-hand or disposed evidence. Source documents
    include the AF Form 52 and the evidence ledger. Final disposal entries in the ledger must be veri-
    fied by comparing them to the AF Form 52 filed in the Reports and Analysis Section. During the
    inventory, the evidence custodian ensures that all entries are correct as of the last entry. When the
    inventory is completed, the incoming custodian will assume responsibility for all evidence by
    signing a statement in the front of the evidence logbook, reflecting the change in custody.
    2.6.1.9. Obtain written approval from the staff judge advocate (SJA) before disposing of evi-
    dence. Document final disposition on evidence tags and in the evidence logbook. Have one wit-
    ness present when security forces destroy drugs or other items not returnable to the person from
    which seized. Witnesses must be in the grade of E-7 or higher (appointed by the installation com-
    mander or designee) and may not be assigned to the security forces squadron.
    2.6.1.9. (AMC) The primary or alternate evidence custodian is responsible for destroying drug
    evidence. Witness appointment authority will not be delegated below group commander level. The
    witness will not be assigned to Security Forces and should not be the same person consecutively.
    Annotate the method of how the evidence was destroyed. When coordinating with the staff judge
    advocate (SJA) for final disposition of evidence, the following guidelines are recommended:
       2.6.1.9.1. (Added-AMC) After a case/investigation is completed, evidence/confiscated prop-
       erty shall generally be returned to its rightful owner. All such releases shall be coordinated
       with the installation staff judge advocate (SJA), who will make a determination as to whether
       the property is contraband (e.g., ownership is illegal) and whether the property should be
       released. The SJA shall consult applicable federal, state, and local laws, including but not lim-
AFI31-206_AMCSUP1_INT 1 AUGUST 2002                                                                         9


           ited to 18 U.S.C. 924 and 930. If the property is a weapon, and the owner is alleged to have
           violated state or local law as well as committing an offense within exclusive federal jurisdic-
           tion, it may be appropriate to transfer control of the weapon to state or local police once federal
           action is complete. Such action shall be coordinated through appropriate state and local law
           enforcement officials.
           2.6.1.9.2. (Added-AMC) All contraband items not turned over to civilian law enforcement
           agencies, such as illegal drugs and weapons, will be destroyed.
       2.6.1.10. Send evidence directly to military or state forensic laboratories using AF Form 1880,
       Forensic Examination Request. State-preferred forms may be used when using state facilities.
       AFOSI handles evidence transmittal requiring FBI analysis. Send evidence by way of certified
       mail, return receipt requested.
       2.6.1.11. (Added-AMC) The sensitive nature of evidence and acquired property require it to be
       secured at all times. The following characteristics are recommended for a functional evidence or
       property room:
           2.6.1.11.1. (Added-AMC) The room design should allow for construction of bins and shelves
           for orderly arrangement of evidence and acquired property, or placement of security filing cab-
           inets or safes. Evidence must be physically separated from abandoned or found property if
           located within the same room.
           2.6.1.11.2. (Added-AMC) The overall capacity of the room must be adequate to accommo-
           date the normal amount of evidence and acquired property handled by the organization.
           2.6.1.11.3. (Added-AMC) A refrigerator must be available to store perishable or unstable
           items.
           2.6.1.11.4. (Added-AMC) Secure classified material that is gathered as evidence IAW AFI
           31-401, Information Security Program Management.

2.7. Lost/Found Property. When appropriate, security forces may take custody of private or govern-
ment property not requiring the same degree of legal accountability as evidence. Security forces will gen-
erally not take custody of property (except for weapons) left with another installation agency (for
example, luggage left by passengers at the passenger terminal, personal property left in or around bar-
racks, exchanges and commissaries). MAJCOM directors of security forces should establish guidelines
on conditions and circumstances under which their units accept lost, found or acquired property.
2.7. (AMC) The installation commander will determine when security forces will accept lost, found, or
acquired property from other units or agencies. Local policy will be developed and published in applica-
ble OIs, regulations, or supplements. Included in the local policy will be disposition actions, to include
timelines and diligent inquiries media (e.g., base newspapers, e-mails, electronic bulletin boards, etc.).
   2.7.1. Use an AF Form 52 as a receipt for lost, found or acquired property.
   2.7.2. Use locally developed procedures to log and track this type of property. Use separate books for
   acquired and evidential material.
   2.7.3. Store lost, found and acquired property separately from evidence. Lost or found property may
   be stored in an evidence room; however, it must be clearly separated (i.e., separate bin or shelf) from
   stored evidence.
10                                                      AFI31-206_AMCSUP1_INT 1 AUGUST 2002


     2.7.4. The base property disposal board (subject to installation commander approval) may choose to
     dispose of property in one of the following manners:
     2.7.4. (AMC) The minutes of the property disposal board will list all property presented to the board.
     The board will examine the property and prepare a written and dated inventory of all property, and
     include an estimated fair market value of each item. The installation commander may authorize con-
     tracting with a civilian towing company to have abandoned privately owned vehicles (APOV)
     removed from the installation at no cost to the Air Force, or to sell APOVs outright. The installation
     legal office shall review the proposed disposition of property recommended by the property disposal
     board to insure all legal requirements are satisfied.
        2.7.4.1. Turn the item(s) in to the Defense Reutilization and Management Office (DRMO) in
        accordance with DoD Manual 4160.21, Defense Reutilization and Marketing Manual.
        2.7.4.2. Donate the item(s) to a non appropriated funds instrumentality (NAFI), for example, the
        auto hobby shop.
        2.7.4.3. Donate the item(s) to a military or private charity, for example, Airman’s Attic or, Salva-
        tion Army.
        2.7.4.4. As otherwise directed by the installation commander, for example; destroy, convert to
        government use or through no cost contract with local business/agency (for disposal of abandoned
        vehicles).
     2.7.5. Regardless of disposal option(s) selected, you must still comply with the requirements of
     DoDM 4160.21 regarding identification and notification of owners, and the time frames required for
     holding property before disposition.
     2.7.6. Demilitarize all unclaimed firearms. Do this through turn in to DRMO or through destruction
     procedures found in DoD 4160.21-M-1, Defense Demilitarization Manual. Demilitarize all major
     assemblies to preclude reuse or reassembly with other parts.
     2.7.7. Retain money until the end of the calendar year, until funds exceed limits prescribed by the
     installation CSF, or release it immediately to the local finance office.

2.8. Joint Drug Enforcement Team (JDET). AFOSI, in coordination with the installation CSF and
installation commander, may establish an AFOSI/SF JDET. Once formed, these teams become the focal
point for the Air Force antidrug efforts at the installation level. The local AFOSI detachment commander
and installation CSF determine the type and extent of direct participation JDET security forces have in
AFOSI operations.

2.9. Polygraph Support. Only AFOSI can conduct forensic psychophysiological detection of deception
examinations (FPDDEs) in support of security forces investigations. Request FPDDE according to AFI
71-101, Volume I. AFOSI IOC/XOSP grants approval for this support.

2.10. Field Testing Controlled Substances. If specifically trained, security forces can field-test sus-
pected marijuana, hashish and other cannabis products, as well as phencyclidine (PCP). They may also
field test for the presence of cocaine with the concurrence of the servicing AFOSI detachment. Contact
AFOSI if a suspect substance tests positive for PCP or cocaine.
AFI31-206_AMCSUP1_INT 1 AUGUST 2002                                                                        11


   2.10.1. Determine field testing for other drugs on a case-by-case basis depending on security forces
   and AFOSI responsibility for a particular investigation. Contact the servicing AFOSI office before
   conducting tests not specifically authorized above.
   2.10.2. Security forces may field-test other narcotics discovered during routine police actions at
   installations with no AFOSI presence. The servicing AFOSI detachment may provide specific training
   for these tests.
   2.10.3. You can get field-test training from your local AFOSI unit, or through trained local civilian
   police personnel.
   2.10.4. Training in field-testing for narcotics must address reading and recording of results; safety
   practices, and environmental considerations. Document this training as determined locally.
   2.10.5. Security forces investigations will notify the local AFOSI detachment anytime they are con-
   ducting a drug related investigation.

2.11. Technical Surveillance Equipment. AFOSI is the sole Air Force agency authorized to conduct
interceptions of communications for law enforcement purposes as outlined in DoDD 5505.9, Intercept of
Wire, Electronic and Oral Communication for Law Enforcement, and AFI 71-101, Volume I. This prohi-
bition does not affect administrative telephone monitoring and recording (example: taping of all calls ter-
minating at the law enforcement desk), closed circuit television for monitoring personnel entry to US Air
Force restricted or controlled areas, for monitoring inmates in a corrections facility, nor for overt video or
audio equipment installed in a marked patrol vehicle.
   2.11.1. Security forces investigators may engage in still photographic surveillance. Before engaging
   in any photographic surveillance, the CSF must review the surveillance plan and consult with the local
   SJA to ensure adequate addressing of privacy concerns.
   2.11.2. Security forces personnel may only use video equipment overtly. This could include docu-
   mentation of a crime or accident scene, line up, interview session, etc. Except for installed in-car
   video (paragraph 2.11.), disable the audio pickup of this equipment unless all personnel within record-
   able distance provide written consent. If there is a need to use video equipment covertly, you must
   request assistance from the local AFOSI.

2.12. Interviews. The investigator has no legal power to compel persons to divulge information. How-
ever, you may ask them to disclose what they know. If a witness or complainant refuses, ask the SJA for
assistance.
   2.12.1. Advise individuals suspected of committing a crime of their rights under Article 31, Uniform
   Code of Military Justice, or the Fifth Amendment, US Constitution before interviewing them. Use
   AFVA 31-231, Advisement of Rights, or the AF Form 1168, Statement of Suspect/Witness/Com-
   plainant. Failure to advise suspects of their rights may make their statements inadmissible in judicial
   proceedings. Before any rights advisement, investigators must first determine whether a suspect has
   requested counsel for this or any previous matter. If so, contact the SJA before attempting the inter-
   view. Immediately cease the interview if the suspect asks to consult legal counsel. Make a note in the
   case file that the suspect invoked his/her right to counsel. Coordinate with the SJA’s office if for any
   reason you desire to attempt a later interview.
12                                                         AFI31-206_AMCSUP1_INT 1 AUGUST 2002


     2.12.2. If, after advisement, the suspect still does not understand his or her rights, reread the rights. If
     that does not resolve the problem, seek advice from the SJA’s office. Never threaten, trick or cajole a
     suspect into waiving his/her rights.
     2.12.3. Make every attempt to have a parent present during the rights advisement of a juvenile (under
     the age of eighteen) suspect. Seek SJA advice if you can’t locate a parent or they can’t respond in a
     timely manner. Stop the interview if the suspect (or parent in cases involving juveniles) requests an
     attorney. The suspect may consult with a lawyer and have a lawyer present during the interview. If the
     suspect initiates contact with security forces after requesting a lawyer, contact the SJA for advice
     before asking any more questions.
     2.12.4. Seek the advice of the SJA before interviewing a civilian suspected as the perpetrator of a
     criminal offense. According to the Weingarten Rights, union employees employed by the Department
     of Defense have the right to have a union representative present during questioning. Investigators do
     not need to advise union employees of the Weingarten Rights; however, if a union employee requestS
     a union representative, investigators must cease the interview until the representative is present. Other
     factors bearing on if and how you can interview a civilian include custodial/noncustodial status, loca-
     tion (overseas) and jurisdiction. Immediately cease the interview if a civilian asks to consult legal
     counsel. Make a note in the case file that the suspect invoked his/her right to counsel. Coordinate with
     the SJA’s office if for any reason you desire to attempt a later interview.
     2.12.5. Make every attempt to have two interviewers present during all suspect interviews. You must
     have another interviewer or witness present when the suspect is a juvenile or of the opposite gender of
     the interviewer. Whenever possible, ensure one of the two interviewers (or witness) is of the same
     gender as the suspect.
     2.12.6. Following interviews with Air Force personnel who are the subject of an investigation, secu-
     rity forces investigators will release the individual to his/her first sergeant, commander or supervisor.
     The release must include person-to-person contact between the security forces member and unit rep-
     resentative, be immediate, and be in writing. DD Form 2708, Receipt for Inmate or Detained Per-
     son, will suffice for this purpose.
     2.12.6. (AMC) If the subject is a minor and a military dependent, security forces investigators will
     release the minor to his/her sponsor, parent(s), or other responsible adult. Military dependent spouses,
     who are “subjects” of investigations, will be released to their sponsor. When sponsors are not avail-
     able for direct handoff (e.g., deployment, etc.), the sponsor’s commanders, first sergeant, or supervi-
     sor will be contacted prior to release.
     2.12.7. If any individual appears to be emotional, distraught or stunned following any interview, the
     interviewee will not be allowed to depart alone. The interviewee can only be released to his/her first
     sergeant, commander, supervisor or their designee. They will help ensure the individual receives the
     necessary support to safely handle his or her personal crisis.
     2.12.7. (AMC) Subjects, who are Air Force personnel and appear emotional or distraught following
     any criminal investigative interview, should not be allowed to depart alone. Release such subjects to
     their commanders, first sergeants, supervisors, or their designees, so proper counseling support can be
     provided. The term “Air Force personnel” includes active duty, DAF civilians, and members of the air
     reserve component. In the context of this paragraph, the term “subject” is defined as “a person about
     which credible information exists that would cause a reasonable person to suspect the person may
     have committed a criminal offense, or otherwise make a person the object of a criminal investigation.”
AFI31-206_AMCSUP1_INT 1 AUGUST 2002                                                                           13


2.13. Line ups. You may use physical and photographic line ups in an attempt to positively identify a
suspect. Coordinate line up procedures through the installation SJA to assure admissibility in judicial pro-
ceedings.
    2.13.1. Consult with the SJA if you need to conduct a physical line up. A line up participant is entitled
    to legal counsel only if the participant is in pretrial restraint or has charges preferred against him/her.
    However, if the participant has contacted counsel and desires the presence of counsel, the investigator
    must permit it. Photographic identifications are not "line ups" requiring you to advise the suspect of
    his/her rights to counsel.

2.14. Reports of Investigation (RCS: DD-P&R(M) 1973). For uniformity in reporting under the
Defense Incident Based Reporting System (DIBRS), complete and attach AF Form 3545, Incident Report,
to all reports of investigation (ROI). When an ROI is attached to an AF Form 3545, the narrative portion
of the AF Form 3545 may state “Refer to attached report of investigation.” When writing an ROI, use the
format in Attachment 3 to maintain consistency with reports of other DoD investigating agencies.
    2.14.1. When forwarding completed ROIs and AF Forms 3545 outside security forces channels,
    cover these documents with an AF Form 445, Security Forces Report of Investigation Cover Sheet.
    This cover sheet draws attention to the report and the responsibility on the part of the recipient to pro-
    tect the potentially sensitive information contained in the report.
    2.14.2. Security Forces Notes and Supporting Documentation. All security forces notes and other
    supporting documentation (statements, search authority, evidence tags, etc.) belong to the USAF.
    Retain these items with the original case file (ROI, incident report or accident investigation). Enclose
    these documents in an AF Form 3986, Case File Document Outer Envelope so they are not lost or
    misplaced. For smaller items which are placed in the AF Form 3986, place these items in an AF Form
    3987, Case File Document Inner Envelope, to prevent them from getting lost and also keep them
    together.

2.15. Records Checks. Security forces may access personnel, medical, dental and financial records in
the performance of official investigations. Use the AF Form 686, Substantive Investigations Record
Check Summary, to collect detailed information as required on each subject during the investigation.
Maintain this form with the completed ROI.

2.16. Release of Information. AFI 51-201, Administration of Justice, outlines Air Force policy on the
release of statements, confessions and other forms of information relating to criminal proceedings. Con-
sult the local SJA with questions.

2.17. Informants. The security forces investigations section may gather information through the use of
informants. When used, establish a central informant information file. Maintain complete security over
this file by securing it in a locked file cabinet and limit access to the investigator, CSF, as directed by court
order or as allowed in writing by the informant.
    2.17.1. Maintain all known information on informants, including their background, occupation, atti-
    tude, motivation for cooperation, criminal record (if applicable), reliability and data on each case for
    which the informant has provided information. Also maintain information on each contact with the
    informant. This includes the time and place of each contact, individuals present, information provided
    by the informant, directions or taskings given by the investigator and money spent.
14                                                       AFI31-206_AMCSUP1_INT 1 AUGUST 2002


     2.17.2. The informant file, because of its confidential nature, is exempt from inspections unless spe-
     cifically authorized by the CSF.
     2.17.3. Contact AFOSI if an informant desires to provide information for financial gain, provides
     information not in the investigative purview of the security forces or has access to criminal activity
     that could result in their being threatened or harmed.

2.18. Field Interview Data. AF Form 3907 will be used to record routine contact between security
forces members and the public. Data obtained from the AF Form 3907 should be compared by investiga-
tors against reported criminal activity to obtain possible leads.

2.19. Defense Clearance and Investigations Index (DCII). Indexing security forces investigative sus-
pects and certain witnesses and victims in the DCII will allow their tracking from base to base and allow
security clearance investigators to identify these individuals as potential security risks.
     2.19.1. Within the Air Force, AFOSI is the agency responsible for putting data in the DCII. Security
     forces will provide originals of all completed reports of investigation, AF Form 3545, and DD Form
     1805, Unites States District Notice Violation, for crimes they have investigated as shown in the
     AFOSI and security forces matrix in Attachment 2. AFOSI will be responsible for the filing and stor-
     age of these documents. Security forces will be responsible to answer any freedom of information
     requests made concerning these reports until the copy of the report, maintained in SF Reports and
     Analysis, is no longer available.
     2.19.2. The DCII has a central file search and retrieval capability. Security forces investigators may
     request searches of DCII through their local AFOSI unit. This search discloses any DoD investigative
     files on individuals. Such searches provide valuable investigative leads and background on individu-
     als involved in ongoing investigations or individuals considered for use as informants.

2.20. Air Force Law Enforcement Terminal System (AFLETS). AFOSI special agents and security
forces investigators can make requests for computerized criminal histories through AFLETS. The instal-
lation CSF establishes procedures for AFLETS in accordance with applicable state guidelines.

2.21. Financial Investigations. DoD Directive 5400.12 prescribes the procedures for the DoD to use in
gaining access to financial records maintained by financial institutions (banks, credit unions, etc.). Secu-
rity forces personnel seeking access to an individual’s financial records during an investigation (bad
checks, etc.) must first ask for the customer’s consent. DoD Directive 5400.12, Enclosures 3 and 10
establish the exact format for consent.
     2.21.1. Security forces personnel seeking access to an individual’s financial records during an inves-
     tigation may issue a formal written request for financial records when the records sought are relevant
     to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry. Issue this request only if the customer declined to consent to
     the disclosure of his/her records or if you determine that seeking consent from the customer would
     compromise or harmfully delay a legitimate law enforcement inquiry. Seek SJA guidance before
     using this procedure. DoD Directive 5400.12, Enclosures 4, 11 and 13 establish the formal written
     request format. Strictly adhere to the customer notification procedure and waiting period specified in
     Enclosure 4.
     2.21.2. Security forces personnel may not use administrative subpoena, search authorizations or judi-
     cial subpoena to obtain financial records. Refer the matter to AFOSI if there is a need to use one of
AFI31-206_AMCSUP1_INT 1 AUGUST 2002                                                                         15


   these procedures. Declination by AFOSI to pursue these avenues is not justification for security forces
   personnel to attempt their use.
   2.21.3. You may not transfer financial records obtained under the provisions of DoD Directive
   5400.12 to another agency or department outside the Department of Defense unless the head of the
   transferring law enforcement office or delegate certifies in writing there is reason to believe the
   records are relevant to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry within the jurisdiction of the receiving
   agency or department. Maintain these certificates with the DoD component’s copy of the released
   records.
   2.21.4. Whenever incorporating financial data obtained under DoD Directive 5400.12 into an ROI or
   other correspondence, take precautions to ensure you make no distribution of the reports or correspon-
   dence outside the DoD except in compliance with procedures set forth in Enclosure 8 of DoD Direc-
   tive 5400.12. The report or other correspondence must also contain an appropriate warning restriction
   on the first page or cover. DoD Directive 5400.12, Enclosure 8 provides a suggested restrictive leg-
   end.
   2.21.5. The provisions of DoD Directive 5400.12 do not govern obtaining access to financial records
   maintained by military banking contractors in overseas or other financial institutions in offices located
   on DoD installations outside the continental US, Puerto Rico, Guam, District of Columbia, American
   Samoa or Virgin Islands. In overseas areas it is preferable to obtain access to financial records main-
   tained by military banking contractors by customer consent.
   2.21.6. Access to financial records maintained by all other financial institutions overseas by law
   enforcement activities must comply with local foreign statutes or procedures governing such access.
   2.21.7. All security forces units must collect statistics on requests for access to financial records held
   by financial institutions in accordance with the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978. Specifically,
   any request for financial records made during the course of an investigation, either by a suspect in
   cooperation with investigators or by use of other formal written request, must be reported.
       2.21.7.1. All security forces units must collect the information on DD Form 2563, Department of
       Defense Right to Financial Privacy Act Report and submit the form to the appropriate MAJ-
       COM for consolidation and submission to the HQ Air Force Security Forces Center, Police Ser-
       vices Branch (HQ AFSFC/SFOP), (RCS: DD-DA&M (A) 1538). Instructions for completing DD
       Form 2563 are found in DoDD 5400.12. The report must reach AFSFC/SFOP no later than 1 Feb-
       ruary of each year. Direct reporting units will report directly to AFSFC/SFOP. AFSFC/SFOP will
       consolidate the inputs and provide a report to SAF/IGX. Negative reports are required.
NOTE: Financial institutions are only legally obligated to provide information in response to procedures
that invoke search warrants or subpoenas. Compliance with other procedures (customer consent and for-
mal written notification) is voluntary. If a financial institution is reluctant to release information, consult
with your local staff judge advocate.
       2.21.7.1. (AMC) Submit unit reports on the collection of financial information on DD Form 2563,
       Department of Defense Right to Financial Privacy Act Report, to HQ AMC/SFO no later than
       15 January each calendar year.

2.22. Investigation of Sexual Misconduct. An action authority (normally the suspect’s commanding
officer) evaluates allegations involving only adult private consensual sexual misconduct according to
DoD Instruction 5505.8, Investigation of Sexual Misconduct by the Defense Criminal Investigative Orga-
16                                                        AFI31-206_AMCSUP1_INT 1 AUGUST 2002


nizations and Other DoD Law Enforcement Organizations. Action authorities normally dispose of such
allegations without the investigative services of AFOSI or the security forces. Installation security forces
may not initiate an investigation solely for an allegation of sexual misconduct without a written request
from an action authority except when the allegation involves force, coercion or intimidation; abuse of
position or rank; fraternization; persons under the age of 16; or conduct directly applicable to security
standards for access to classified information.
     2.22.1. Before the initiation of any investigation into sexual misconduct, the CSF should meet with
     the SJA to ensure a security forces investigation of the matter is in the best interests of the Air Force.
     2.22.2. You must limit investigations to the factual circumstances directly relevant to the specific
     allegation.
     2.22.3. Do not initiate an investigation to determine sexual orientation, that is, whether a service
     member is a heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual.
     2.22.4. (Added-AMC) All investigators and security forces leadership must review annually, the pol-
     icies contained in DODI 5505.8, Investigations of Sexual Misconduct by the Defense Criminal Inves-
     tigative Organizations and Other DOD Law Enforcement Organizations; and AFI 31-206, paragraph
     2.22., Investigation of Sexual Misconduct. Document this review locally.

2.23. Victim/Witness Assistance Program (VWAP). According to DoD Directive 1030.1, Victim and
Witness Assistance; and DoD Instruction 1030.2, Victim and Witness Assistance Procedures, identifica-
tion of victims and witnesses is the responsibility of the agency that investigates the crime, e.g., SF, OSI.
The term “investigates” also applies to first responders. These two DoD publications and AFI 51-201,
provide guidance on the implementation of these programs in the Air Force.
     2.23.1. Scope of VWAP. VWAP applies in all cases in which criminal conduct adversely affects vic-
     tims or in which witnesses provide information regarding criminal activity. Pay special attention to
     victims of violent crime, but ensure all victims and witnesses of crime who suffer physical, financial
     or emotional trauma receive the assistance they are entitled to.
     2.23.2. Security Forces Role in VWAP. Security forces members are critical members of a multi-dis-
     ciplinary team. As first responders and investigators, security forces members contribute to the suc-
     cess of other team members (e.g. OSI, SJA, Chaplains) who follow during resolution of the incident.
     2.23.3. Security Forces Goals in VWAP. Security forces goals are more far-reaching than effective
     first response. They are:
        2.23.3.1. Immediate and permanent termination of the harmful act(s).
        2.23.3.2. Favorable resolution of the incident. Incidents are considered favorably resolved when
        offenders have been identified and held accountable, and the victim has been referred to the appro-
        priate agencies for assistance in recovering from the incident.
        2.23.3.3. Recovery of the victim. Complete recovery from an incident is largely dependent on a
        victim’s willingness to participate in the recovery process. Although security forces cannot do the
        actual recovering for the victim, they can ensure the victim is properly treated and informed about
        available resources.
     2.23.4. Providing Information. Every security forces member standing or working a post must carry a
     supply of DD Forms 2701, Initial Information for Victims and Witnesses of Crime. Distribute DD
AFI31-206_AMCSUP1_INT 1 AUGUST 2002                                                                     17


   Form 2701 to any person meeting the requirements of paragraph 2.23.1. When in doubt as to whether
   a person meets the requirements to be issued a DD Form 2701, issue the form. Annotate the AF Form
   3545 whenever a DD Form 2701 is issued.
       2.23.4.1. Provide all victims with reasonable ideas for protection. Examples of reasonable ideas
       for protection would be properly securing homes, work places and property. For victims of domes-
       tic violence or abuse, staying with family members or friends would be an example of a reason-
       able idea for protection.
       2.23.4.2. Brief all victims and witnesses on the four phases of the judicial process (response,
       investigation, prosecution and confinement) and provide them with information on what may be
       expected from them during each phase.
   2.23.5. Security forces, in conjunction with the base SJA, develop a training syllabus for local use
   that includes those items unique to the base and local area as well as any state law and available
   resources that might apply to the victim. This training applies to investigators and other security
   forces personnel as appropriate.
   2.23.6. If necessary, security forces and AFOSI will provide protection or coordinate with other fed-
   eral, state or local law enforcement authorities to protect the victim/witness. Security forces must
   notify the SJA when they identify a victim. This allows the SJA to administer the victim/witness assis-
   tance process.
   2.23.7. Investigators must "flag" incident reports to indicate it is a "victim/witness" case. Adding a
   prefix or suffix to the case number aids the SJA’s auditing process of victim/witness cases.
   2.23.8. The importance of securing the cooperation of victims and witnesses cannot be overstated.
   Our ability to appropriately interact with victims and witnesses is essential to securing that coopera-
   tion. One general thought applies to VWAP scenarios--what good does it do to secure crime scenes,
   collect evidence, conduct interviews, ascertain facts and apprehend offenders if the victim is turned
   off by the process?

2.24. Fingerprinting Military Suspects Under Investigation. DoD Instruction 5505.11, requires an
FD-249, Suspect Fingerprint Card, be submitted on all military suspects under investigation by security
forces for offenses listed in DoDI 5505.11, Enclosure 3, only when such offenses are disposed of by
court-martial or command action by an Article 15.
   2.24.1. Offender criminal history data records required under DoDI 5505.11 will be initiated by pre-
   paring and submitting FD-249 to the FBI. Submit the FD-249 when the commander initiates military
   judicial proceedings or takes action in non judicial proceedings against a military subject investigated
   for an offense listed in Enclosure 3. Submit the FD-249 within 15 days of initiation of military judi-
   cial or non judicial proceedings.
   2.24.2. If final disposition of the proceedings is expected within 60 days, hold the FD-249 and submit
   it with command action taken. If proceedings are expected to take longer than 60 days, submit the
   FD-249 without command action and follow it up with FBI/DOJ Form R-84, Final Disposition
   Report, when action is taken. Do not delay filing the FD-249 past 60 days.
   2.24.3. Approvals of requests for discharge, retirement or resignation in lieu of court-martial and/or a
   finding of lack of mental competence to stand trial shall be recorded as final disposition on either the
   FD-249 or R-84 as appropriate.

     2.24.4. Procedures for obtaining the necessary forms and training are found in DoDI 5505.11.

2.25. Obtaining Bad Checks from AAFES. Security forces investigators obtain copies of bad checks
directly from HQ AAFES, Dallas, TX at HQ AAFES, FA-T-R/C (Check Fraud Section). P.O. Box
650038, Dallas, TX 75265-0038.
     2.25.1. The investigator will prepare the request letter on official letterhead. The letter must contain
     the subject’s name, social security number, and information on the checks required. The investigator
     will also provide their commercial and Defense Switched Network (DSN) telephone numbers along
     with their e-mail address, if possible.
     2.25.2. The investigator must also prepare a self-addressed return envelope (using his/her name and
     address). This return envelope must be either a certified, express mail service with positive controls,
     or registered mail prepaid envelope. This allows for AAFES’s tracking and proof the checks were for-
     warded. NOTE: The retrieval process can take between 45 and 60 days.
     2.25.3. Upon receipt of checks, the investigator will sign them into evidence. Once the checks are no
     longer required as evidence, the investigator will return them to HQ AFFES at the address shown in
     paragraph 2.25.

2.26. Forms Prescribed. AF Form 688, AF Form 310, SF 1164, AF Form 52, AF Form 1880, AFVA
31-231, AF Form 1168, DD Form 2708, AF Form 3545, AF Form 445, AF Form 686, AF Form 3907, DD
Form 2563, DD Form 2701, FD-249, FBI/DOJ Form R-84, AF Form 3986, AF Form 3987.
