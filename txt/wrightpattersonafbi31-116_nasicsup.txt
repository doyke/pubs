                                           Chapter 2

                                   DRIVING PRIVILEGES

2.1. Driving Privileges Requirements.
   2.1.1. Driving a government motor vehicle (GMV) or privately owned vehicle (POV) on
   WPAFB property and within WPAFB federal jurisdiction is a privilege granted by the
   88 ABW/CC. This includes The Prairies and The Woods housing areas and parking lots
   under federal jurisdiction but located in areas where access is not normally controlled.
   Individuals must comply with federal and state laws and all instructions governing motor
   vehicle operation and registration on the installation. Upon request from Security Forces,
   Department of the Air Force Police Officers, or other posted installation entry controllers,
   everyone operating a motor vehicle on WPAFB must produce the following:
      2.1.1.1. Proof of vehicle ownership or current registration.
      2.1.1.2. A valid state, provincial or international driver’s license. WPAFB and the State
      of Ohio honor international driver’s licenses for a period of six months. After six
      months, civilian personnel must apply for an Ohio driver’s license. Military personnel
      may apply for a license from Ohio or their home state or may elect to renew a license
      from another state. Security Forces may deny installation access to drivers whose license
      has been expired, unless extended IAW military exemption provisions afforded by the
      state of license issue.
      2.1.1.3. Proof of current vehicle insurance as required by the State of Ohio.
      2.1.1.4. A valid AF Form 2293, USAF Motor Vehicle Operator ID Card, when operating
      certain types of GMV, See AFI 24-301 for more information.
   2.1.2. Security Forces may deny base access to any vehicle bearing an expired state or
   international license plate or invalid state or international registration.
2.2. Stopping and Inspecting Personnel or Vehicles.
   2.2.1. 50 U.S.C. 797 and DODI 5200.08, Security of DoD Installations and Resources and
   the DoD Physical Security Review Board (PSRB) grant the Installation Commander
   (88 ABW/CC) the authority to stop, inspect, search, and impound motor vehicles at
   installation gates and Air Force restricted areas to ensure the safety and security of all
   personnel and resources.
   2.2.2. Reasons for conducting these activities may include, but are not limited to: increased
   force protection conditions; random vehicle inspections; and when there is reasonable basis
   to believe it is necessary to enforce a traffic regulation or when there is suspicion of criminal
   activity.
2.3. Implied Consent to Vehicle Impoundment.
   2.3.1. As a condition to driving on the installation, drivers consent to the removal and
   temporary impoundment of their POV from exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction if their POV
   is:
      2.3.1.1. Illegally parked:
 8                            WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI31-116_NASICSUP 23 JULY 2014


            2.3.1.1.1. On a street or bridge or is double parked and interferes with the orderly
            flow of traffic.
            2.3.1.1.2. On a sidewalk, within an intersection, on a crosswalk, on a railroad track,
            in a fire lane or is blocking a driveway, so that the vehicle interferes with operations
            or creates a safety hazard to other roadway users or the general public. An example
            would be a vehicle parked within 10 feet of a fire hydrant or blocking the properly
            marked driveway of a fire station.
            2.3.1.1.3. When blocking an emergency exit door of any public place (installation
            theater, club, dining hall, or hospital, etc.).
            2.3.1.1.4. In a “tow–away” zone that is so marked with proper signs.
        2.3.1.2. Interfering with traffic operations.
        2.3.1.3. Interfering with military operations.
        2.3.1.4. Creating a safety hazard.
        2.3.1.5. Disabled by accident or incident.
        2.3.1.6. Left unattended in, or adjacent to, a restricted, controlled, or off-limits area.
        2.3.1.7. Abandoned. Obvious signs of abandonment include but are not limited to: flat
        tires; registration expired for greater than 6 months; excessive fluids under the vehicle; an
        accumulation of debris on the vehicle indicating it has not moved for some time, etc..
        See paragraph 3.6 for more information regarding abandoned vehicles.
     2.3.2. Drivers agree to reimburse an authorized agency or contractor for the cost of towing,
     storage, and disposal should a need arise to remove or impound their vehicle.
2.4. Administrative Process for Suspensions and Revocations.
     2.4.1. Individuals whose driving privileges have been suspended, revoked or otherwise
     restricted or limited by the 88 ABW/CC, his or her designated representative, or any state,
     must not drive a POV or GMV on WPAFB, to include The Prairies at Wright Field and The
     Woods at Wright Field, without first obtaining written permission from the 88 ABW/CC or
     his or her designated representative. Additionally, any person who has had their installation
     driving privileges revoked by an installation commander from another installation (and the
     period of revocation has not ended) must obtain written permission to drive on WPAFB from
     the 88 ABW/CC or his or her designated representative. EXCEPTION: Suspended or
     revoked drivers who live in The Prairies at Wright Field or The Woods at Wright Field
     privatized housing areas may drive to and from their quarters, via the most direct route, and
     park their POV(s) at their quarters provided they meet the licensing requirements of
     paragraphs 2.1.1.2. and 2.1.1.3. Additionally, suspended or revoked drivers who are
     authorized to use the WPAFB Medical Center may drive to/from the Medical Center for
     emergency care or scheduled appointments for themselves or their dependents. Access to the
     Medical Center will be via the most direct route. Individuals must have a copy of the
     scheduled appointment from the Medical Center with them when driving to and from
     scheduled appointments.
     2.4.2. The Installation SJA is designated as the reviewing official for all
     suspensions/revocations (except those issued for preliminary suspension at the time of
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI31-116_NASICSUP 23 JULY 2014                                               9


  apprehension for DUI), with all supporting documentation will be coordinated through the
  installation SJA prior to the package’s approval and presentation to the offender. The
  installation SJA will review the package to ensure the evidence supports administrative
  suspension/revocation of installation driving privileges. This review must occur within three
  duty days of receipt of the package.
  2.4.3. If 88 MSG/CC determines suspension/revocation of driving privileges is not
  warranted, s/he will inform 88 SFS/S5R and the suspension/revocation process will be
  terminated. This decision does not remove any citations from the individual’s base driving
  record.
  2.4.4. After receiving the 88 MSG/CC signed suspension/revocation notification letter,
  88 SFS/S5R will send the letter to the offender’s commander/director and the offender and
  schedule an appointment for the offender to report to 88 SFS/S5R to receive a briefing on the
  suspension/revocation policy and the availability of scheduling a due process hearing. If the
  offender does not contact 88 SFS/S5R within ten (10) business days to schedule the briefing,
  the offender will be added to the Suspensions, Revocations, Barments, and Warrants
  (SRBW) roster in the Security Forces Management Information System (SFMIS), ten (10)
  calendar days from receiving verification that the offender received the letter. Verification
  can be in the form of an email read receipt or other confirmation of receipt. In cases where
  the person is not employed on base or ascertaining a unit of assignment or affiliation is not
  possible, 88 SFS/S5R will mail the memorandum to them via certified mail. 88 SFS/S5R
  will add the offender to the SRBW ten (10) calendar days from the date of signature on the
  PS Form 3811, Certified Mail Domestic Return Receipt, unless the offender has scheduled a
  due process hearing through 88 SFS/S5R.
  2.4.5. To contest a suspension/revocation or to request restricted driving privileges, the
  individual must request a due process hearing within ten (10) business days from receipt of
  the suspension/revocation notice. Personnel requesting a due process hearing will contact the
  88 SFS/S5R at 522-6532. 88 SFS/S5R will schedule the appointment with the 88 MSG
  Command Section. Persons who call the 88 MSG directly will be advised to call 88
  SFS/S5R. Hearings are held in building 10, room 245, Area A. Individuals are responsible
  for planning and arranging leave time to attend the hearing.
     2.4.5.1. Hearing officers will make recommendations to the 88 MSG/CC, who renders a
     decision. The 88 MSG/CC’s hearing decision may be appealed in writing to the
     88 ABW/CV through SJA. The 88 ABW/CV decision is final. Only one appeal may be
     made for a specific suspension/revocation. There is no further appeal process authorized.
  2.4.6. Regardless of status (e.g. active duty, reserve, guard, civil servant, contractor), all
  personnel must, as soon as possible, notify their military chain of command if they are
  involved in an off-base intoxicated driving incident regardless where the incident occurred.
  Unit commanders and directors must immediately notify 88 SFS/S5R when they become
  aware of such an incident. 88 SFS/S5R will prepare a package for legal review to suspend
  the base driving privileges of the person involved until the case is resolved. If an
  individual’s state driver license is suspended, their base driving privilege is automatically
  considered for suspension pursuant to paragraph 2.1.1.2. of this instruction. Reinstatement
  of state driving privileges does not automatically result in the reinstatement of base driving
 10                         WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI31-116_NASICSUP 23 JULY 2014


   privileges. Reinstatement of base driving privileges may be requested any time there is a
   change in circumstances by following the process in paragraph 2.4.5.
   2.4.7. Persons whose state driver licenses have restricted driving privileges who are seeking
   employment on the installation for their work must apply in writing through 88 SFS/S5R, to
   the 88 MSG/CC for installation driving privileges.
2.5. Restricted Driving Privileges.
   2.5.1. An individual must possess a valid state, provincial or international driver license to
   be granted restricted driving privileges on base. The 88 ABW/CV, 88 MSG/CC, or
   88 MSG/CD may grant restricted driving privileges under the provisions of paragraph
   2.5.1.2.
       2.5.1.1. Being granted partial or restricted driving privileges by proper civilian authority
       does not automatically grant driving privileges on WPAFB.
       2.5.1.2. A request for restricted driving privileges may be accomplished at the due
       process hearing or at any other time, to the 88 MSG/CC. Approval of restricted driving
       privileges will be specified in writing and provided to the offender and 88 SFS/S5R.
       Restricted driving privileges may be granted for the following reasons:
          2.5.1.2.1. Mission requirements.
          2.5.1.2.2. Unusual personal or family hardship.
          2.5.1.2.3. Delays exceeding 90 days, not attributed to the person concerned, in the
          formal disposition of an apprehension or charges that are the basis for any type of
          suspension or revocation.
          2.5.1.2.4. When there is no reasonably available alternate means of transportation to
          officially assigned duties. In this instance, a limited exception can be granted for the
          sole purpose of driving directly to and from the place of duty.
       2.5.1.3. Disapproved requests for restricted driving privileges may be appealed to the
       88 ABW/CV. The decision of the 88 ABW/CV is final and cannot be appealed.
       Restricted driving privileges issued during a suspension are revoked if driving privileges
       are later suspended or revoked. Violators may petition for the restoration of all or partial
       driving privileges upon notification of such revocation.
2.6. Extensions of Suspensions and Revocations.
   2.6.1. Any individual discovered driving on WPAFB while their state driver license or
   installation driving privileges are suspended/revoked will have the original period of
   suspension/revocation extended by two years, IAW AFI 31-218_IP, paragraph 2-12.a., unless
   limited driving privileges were granted by 88 MSG/CC. This action does not preclude
   commanders, directors, managers or supervisors from taking additional administrative action
   under the UCMJ or other applicable guidance. Contractor or non-base connected personnel
   in violation of suspension or revocation may receive a barment order under Title 50, United
   States Code, Section 797.

   2.7.2. Individuals who wish to park in other locations must request permission at the due
   process hearing or by requesting permission to do so in writing from the 88 MSG/CC.
   Permission must be approved prior to parking in an alternate location. 88 MSG/CC approval
   will be in writing and provided to the individual and 88 SFS/S5R.
2.8. Reciprocal State-Military Action. If a military member, civilian, or contractor employee
has their installation driving privileges suspended/revoked by the installation commander or their
designated representative, 88 SFS/S5R will notify the licensing authority of the state where a
license is issued as required by AFI 31-218_IP, Paragraph 2-11.c. (2), and AFMAN 31-201v7,

        connectivity, or similar technology that enables one-touch call answering). Using the
        speaker phone feature of a cellular telephone is not considered a hands-free device if
        the phone is being held in the driver’s hand. Additionally, even when using a hands-
        free device, drivers will not manually dial out to place telephone calls while the
        vehicle is in motion. The use of voice recognition technology to dial and place a call
        while in motion is authorized and recommended.
        3.3.1.7.3. The wearing of any other portable headphones, earphones, or other
        listening devices while operating a motor vehicle is prohibited. Use of those devices
        impairs driving and masks or prevents recognition of emergency signals, alarms,

            package containing a detailed request with adequate maps depicting existing
            parking configurations and proposed changes. All packages will be coordinated
            through 88 SFS/S3P, who will submit the coordinated package to 88 ABW/CE for
            final approval.
            3.11.6.4.1.2. The RPBM must obtain the unit commander’s/director’s

            maintaining a listing and diagram of reserved parking slots. To propose changes
            to a facility’s reserved parking plan, the unit commander/director is responsible
            for obtaining the coordination and/or concurrence of all units in the affected
            facility prior to submitting the parking request to 88 ABW/CE.
            3.11.6.4.1.3. The RPBM will evaluate each request and complete an AF Form
            332, Base CE Work Request.          The request will indicate the type of work
            requested, justification with a diagram of the target area and a letter of approval
            from the approving official. This package is forwarded to 88 ABW/CEOS to
            assign a CE work order number. 88 ABW/CEOS forwards the AF Form 332 to
            88 ABW/CEPMP for review. Within 2 weeks, 88 ABW/CEPMP will obtain
            coordination from 88 SFS Police Services (88 SFS/S3P). 88 SFS/S3P will reply
            with a recommendation of approval/disapproval within 2 weeks. If 88 SFS/S3P
            recommends disapproval, the work will not be completed until resolution is
24                        WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI31-116_NASICSUP 23 JULY 2014


            achieved. Upon review and coordination, the AF Form 332 will be forwarded to
            88 ABW/CE for approval/disapproval. Approved work orders will be sent to
            88 ABW/CEOHS for installation. Disapproved requests will be returned to the
            originator. The requestor may appeal disapproval of a request by forwarding a
            letter to the 88 ABW/CE outlining why his/her reserved parking request should be
            reconsidered. The appeal will be reviewed by 88 ABW/CE, who will render a
            final decision.
            3.11.6.4.1.4. The RPBM is also responsible for completing a biennial review of
            the original or updated request. This review shall be documented and kept on file
            with a legible copy of the current AF Form 332 and the diagram that was
            approved by 88 ABW/CE. A complete review must be submitted annually (by 31
            October) to 88 ABW/CE.
  3.11.7. Handicapped Parking. The only vehicles authorized to park in these areas are those

  placards, signs, etc…from other states.
     3.11.7.1. Assigned spaces for handicapped individuals may be granted on a case-by-case,
     and rare basis. Should special circumstances warrant the assignment of a space to an
     individual employee at their primary place of employment, a request will be submitted in
     accordance with paragraph 3.11.6.4., and following paragraphs.               Handicapped
     employees requesting an assigned parking space in order to accommodate their disability
     shall provide the RPBM with a copy of their state issued handicapped parking permit
     with the person’s name and expiration date on the permit. The RPBM will forward the
     request with written justification for the designation. Such requests will be processed in
     accordance with paragraph 3.11.6 4.1. and following paragraphs. Spaces assigned
     under the provisions of this paragraph shall be marked with signage as “ASSIGNED #”
     reserved spaces and they shall be re-validated annually. These spaces shall not affect the
     number of handicapped spaces required at a given facility.

     signage indicating handicapped parking. There may be cases where parking lots/areas
     overlap.    In such cases, the RPBM for each facility will coordinate with
     overlapping/adjoining facility RPBMs to ensure this temporary relocation meets the
     needs of the handicapped workforce of each facility. As soon as possible, but no later
     than the next duty day after stand-off restrictions are terminated, the RPBM will remove
     the temporary signage.

  visiting, rather they go to a place for purpose of inspection, business, duty or travel.
  Employees of a specific building will not park in designated visitor parking for that building
  or nearby buildings if they are not actually visiting. Visitor parking often has imposed time
  restrictions (i.e., 15 minutes, 2 hours, etc.). Visitor parking for public service facilities
  should be located as close to the building entrance/exit as possible.

  3.11.9. General Officer/SES, Colonel/GS/GM-15, and CMSgt Parking. These spaces are not
  assigned to a particular person or position and are utilized on a first-come, first-served basis.

     designed for units with few or no government vehicles available to accomplish the
     mission.
     3.11.15.2. Permits will be issued by 88 SFS Police Services section (88 SFS/S3P) to the
     requestor’s unit and not to a particular vehicle/person. Only permits signed and issued by
     the authorizing 88 SFS official are valid on WPAFB. Permits are issued based on the
     mission needs. To keep the number of permits to a minimum, organizations with fewer
     than 50 people may be issued no more than one permit. For organizations with more than
     50, the maximum number of permits issued will not exceed two percent of the
     organization’s authorized strength. For example, an organization with 201 people
     assigned multiplied by two percent would be eligible for 4.02 (rounded off to 4) permits.
     It is imperative that commanders/directors review the need prior to requesting permits.
     Permits will be issued on a case-by-case basis after review of circumstances surrounding
     the request. At a minimum, all requests must meet the general guidelines listed below.
         3.11.15.2.1. The organization has limited or no authorized government vehicles.

         commander, director, or detachment chief to 88 SFS Police Services (88 SFS/S3P),
         who has program management responsibilities.
         3.11.15.2.3. Individuals may use the pass only when performing government duties
         and not for personal use or convenience. Abuse of the permit will result in immediate
         termination of the permit and the appropriate commander/director will be notified,
         explaining the circumstances for confiscation of the permit.
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI31-116_NASICSUP 23 JULY 2014                                                 27


           3.11.15.2.4. Permits are issued for a one calendar year period, from 1 January to 31
           December.
   3.11.16. Long term parking: To help relieve congestion in base parking areas, a long term
   parking area has been established on Wright Patterson AFB for personnel on deployment,
   TDY and Space A travel. The long term parking area is located at the SE portion (near the
   installation perimeter fence) of the parking lot located on the North side of Pearson Road
   near the intersection of Pearson Road and Buckner Road, Area A. All personnel departing
   for longer than 30 days will use the long term parking area, except those personnel who
   reside in government or leased housing. Those individuals may park their vehicles in legal,
   parking spaces near their quarters. Base employees will not use other base parking lots (e.g.
   adjacent to their duty location) for long term parking.
       3.11.16.1. Personnel desiring to use the long term parking area will complete the
       WPAFB Form 1441, Long Term Parking Area, and submit it to 88 SFS/S2I.
       3.11.16.2. 88 SFS will manage and track vehicles in the long term parking lot.
3.12. Parking Violations: A DD Form 1408 will be completed for all parking violations,
regardless of the violator’s duty status (e.g. military, civilian, etc.). Parking citations will be
charged against the party to whom the vehicle is registered, unless credible evidence is received
that another individual is responsible for the infraction.
3.13. The Parking Warden Program.
   3.13.1. 88 SFS/S5R will manage the installation Parking Warden Program.
       3.13.1.1. 88 SFS/S5R will ensure parking wardens are trained on specific parking
       warden duties. There will be initial training when assigned and remedial training as
       needed.
       3.13.1.2. The 88 ABW/CV is appointed a parking warden for the entire installation. The
       88 MSG/CC, 88 CG/CC, 88 MDG/CC and 88 ABW/CE are appointed parking wardens
       for facilities under their respective control.
       3.13.1.3. The unit commander or director or detachment chief exercising jurisdiction
       over a particular facility or building, will appoint parking wardens (designated military in
       the grade of E-5 or above and Air Force civilian employees in the grade of GS-5 (or
       equivalent) or above in writing to 88 SFS/S5R for specific building/facility parking lots.
       Federal contractors may not be appointed as parking wardens. New appointment letters
       will be sent to 88 SFS/S5R NLT 31 Jan of each year and whenever changes occur (i.e., a
       parking warden or appointing official departs the installation). No more than 5 parking
       wardens are allowed per building/facility. The appointing official will also direct/dictate
       the scope of operations and time spent dealing with parking issues. This is an additional
       duty, therefore parking wardens are not appointed solely to focus on parking, but to assist
       the RPBM in enforcing parking plans and to randomly monitor parking areas or deal with
       illegal parking issues. No one may write a parking ticket without being appointed in
       writing and completing training as specified above. Ticket books are issued to specific,
       trained individuals, not to units or organizations. Tickets may not be shared with other
       parking wardens. If a parking warden departs the installation (retirement, PCS, etc.) or
 28                         WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI31-116_NASICSUP 23 JULY 2014


       otherwise stops performing warden duties, they must return their ticket book to 88
       SFS/S5R.
   3.13.1.4. Parking wardens will follow the same ticket writing procedures as Security Forces
   members. Parking wardens will enforce compliance with this instruction by writing parking
   tickets and/or calling Security Forces to report a vehicle requiring towing, according to this
   instruction. Tickets will be received into 88 SFS/S5R within 5 duty days of the date of issue.
       3.13.1.5. Within 24 hours (or the next business day) of receiving the ticket, the violator
       will contact the parking warden who issued the ticket and provide the information (i.e.,
       name, unit, DOB, etc.) necessary to complete the DD Form 1408. If, during the
       exchange of information, it is evident to the parking warden the ticket should not have
       been issued, he/she will contact the Chief, 88 SFS/S5R, and explain the circumstances.
       Within 3 duty days of notification from the parking warden, the Chief, 88 SFS/S5R will
       investigate the facts and determine if the ticket should be voided. If the Chief, 88
       SFS/S5R determines the ticket should be voided, he/she will notify the parking warden
       and the violator of the decision. Either the parking warden or the Chief, 88 SFS/S5R,
       will retrieve the pink copy of the ticket from the violator, write “VOID” across the front
       of the ticket, ensure the parking warden’s ticket log is annotated to reflect the ticket was
       voided, and ensure all three copies of the ticket are sent to 88 SFS/S5R. If the Chief, 88
       SFS/S5R determines the ticket is valid, he/she will notify the parking warden and the
       violator and normal ticket processing actions begin. If the violator wishes to rebut the
       ticket, the normal rebuttal process begins effective the date of the offense as detailed in
       paragraph 3.14.1.4.1.
       3.13.1.6. Ticketed persons are prohibited from subjecting parking wardens to any
       pressure to void a ticket because of the rank, status, or position of the offender or to make
       any attempt to influence the parking warden into voiding the ticket.
       3.13.1.7. 88 SFS/S5R will closely monitor the conduct of parking wardens. Parking
       wardens who consistently fail to ensure tickets are correctly completed and sent to
       88 SFS/S5R within established timelines or who abuse their authority will be remedially
       trained or have their privileges revoked. 88 SFS/S5R will send a memorandum to the
       appointing official outlining the parking warden’s deficiencies.
       3.13.1.8. Parking wardens will maintain a roster of reserved parking spaces assigned to
       their building/facility and the people authorized to use those slots. Handicapped and
       GMV parking spots are considered reserved parking, but are not typically assigned to any
       one specific person or vehicle.
3.14. Traffic Violation Reports.
   3.14.1. Moving violations. Anyone operating a motor vehicle, including a bicycle, on a
   public street or highway that violates a provision of this regulation has committed a moving
   violation. Except as set out herein, CVB Form 1805, DD Form 1408, and/or AF Form 3545,
   Incident Report, are authorized methods of documenting and/or enforcing the requirements
   of this instruction. Personnel from other installations will be identified and their infractions
   will be forwarded to the appropriate agency for action. 88 SFS/S5R is responsible for
   distribution of information concerning infractions.

        offense involved.
        3.14.1.1.3. Persons receiving a CVB Form 1805 are given the option of forfeiting
        collateral for minor traffic violations. More serious charges require court appearance.

        driving record if they are acquitted or have their citation dismissed by the Magistrate
        Court.
     3.14.1.2. DD Form 1408: Security Forces use the DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic

     3.14.1.4.1. The individual who received the DD Form 1408 must initiate a rebuttal to
     the validity of the 1408 within 5 duty days of receiving the ticket by contacting 88
     SFS/S5R and indicating intent to rebut. Failure to do so will result in the ticket being
     annotated with “Did Not Rebut” and will be loaded into SFMIS and sent out for
     action. If the individual contacts 88 SFS/S5R and initiates rebuttal action within the 5
     duty day window, 88 SFS/S5R will provide detailed instructions on how to conduct
     the rebuttal. The rebuttal package includes a statement from the patrolman or parking
     warden who issued the ticket as well as mandatory comments from the violator’s
     commander (or civilian equivalent), 88 SFS/S5R, and the 88 SFS/CC. The final
     decision rests with the decision-making authority, as stipulated in paragraph 1.2.2.2.
     The entire package must reach the 88 SFS/CC within 14 calendar days of the date the
     ticket was written. After the decision-making authority renders his/her decision, 88

        the DD Form 1408 template indicating the action taken for the violation. Upon
        receipt of the response from the unit, 88 SFS/S5R will close out the “action
        taken” portion of the incident in SFMIS.
        3.14.1.4.1.2. If the rebuttal authority dismisses the ticket, it will be voided from
        the recipients SFMIS history and the no further action is required.
