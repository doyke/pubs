  The EO Office provides service to individuals who believe they have been discriminated against based on their race, color,
    sex (including sexual harassment), religion, national origin, age (40+), disability, genetic information and/or reprisal.

 How to File an Informal Complaint:
 CIVILIAN: To file a complaint, an employee, former employee or applicant for employment must contact an EO Counselor
 within 45 calendar days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory to begin the formal process.

 MILITARY: Military members, retirees, or family members (except for off base employment concerns) may contact the EO
 Office to file an informal complaint. The informal resolution process is available as an alternative to filing a formal military
 complaint. The informal process allows individuals to handle their grievance themselves or through their chain of command.
 Electing to use the informal process does not prevent filing a formal complaint if resolution was not possible at the informal
 process.

 Filing a Formal Complaint:
 CIVILIAN: If a complaint has not been resolved through EO Counseling or Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), a complainant
 may file a formal complaint of discrimination. The EO Counselor assigned to the complaint provides the complainant a Notice
 of Right to File a formal complaint during the final interview. This notice establishes the requirement that formal complaints
 must be filed within 15 calendar days of the receipt of the Notice of the Right to File a Formal Complaint. The EO Counselor
 may assist complainants in filling out the DD Form 2265, Complaint of Discrimination in the federal government. Formal
 complaints are handled by the 42 ABW/EO Office, including interface with the Department of Defense, Investigation and
 Resolution Division (IRD) and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).

 MILITARY: A member may elect to file a complaint of discrimination without using the informal process. To be accepted as a
 formal complaint, allegations of discrimination must have occurred within 60 days of contacting the EO office. The role of the
 EO staff in military formal complaints is to assist the complainant with summarizing, documenting and clarifying allegations.
