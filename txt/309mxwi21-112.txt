     1.2. The 309 MXW CC has in turn, appointed the 309th Maintenance Support Group (309
     MXSG) as the OPR for depot maintenance capacity and utilization measurement.
     1.3. The 309 MXSG CC has in turn, appointed the 309th Maintenance Support Squadron
     (309 MXSS) Industrial Services as the office of coordinating responsibility (OCR) for depot
     maintenance capacity and utilization measurement.
     1.4. The 309 MXSS CC has in turn, appointed the 309th Maintenance Support Squadron
     Engineering Flight (309 MXSS/MXDEA) as the OCR for depot maintenance capacity and
     utilization measurement.
        1.4.1. The 309 MXSS/MXDEA will manage and oversee/coordinate the 309 MXW
        depot maintenance capacity and utilization measurement.
     1.5. The 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (309 AMARG) Workload
     Section (309 AMARG/OBW) will manage and oversee/coordinate the 309 AMARG depot
     maintenance capacity and utilization measurement.
2. 309th Maintenance Support Squadron Responsibilities.
     2.1. The 309 MXSS/MXDEA will appoint a representative in the following sections to be
     the designated 309 MXSG facility point of contact (POC), who will function as a member of
     the 309 MXW facility working group.

     their responsibilities documented in their job descriptions AF Form 1003, Air Force Core
     Personnel Document, as a critical element. The statement will read as follows: As a
     designated group/squadron capacity representative, uses methodologies prescribed for the
     analysis and reporting of Depot Maintenance Capacity and Utilization Measurement in

3. Procedures.
   3.1. Each capacity representative at the group/squadron level will begin the depot capacity
   and utilization measurement process by obtaining a complete list of current/valid RCCs from
   the group resource manager. Each RCC will be further defined using the appropriate
   production shop categories in both DoD 4151.18-H, Appendix 5, and AFMCI 21-140,
   Appendix 2. This list is the foundation for the annual capacity data call as required by HQ
   AFMC/A4D.
   3.2. Each capacity representative will follow the techniques defined in DoD 4151.18-H,
   Paragraph. C3.2, Baseline Capacity Index; to compute the capacity for all production shops
   that perform direct work within their group/squadron. The results of these computations will
   be provided to the WCL. Supplemental guidance and/or templates used for determining
   work positions will be provided as necessary, by HQ AFMC/A4DM.
   3.3. The detailed shop layouts, identifying the equipment, and function of each shop at the
   RCC level will be annotated using the formats prescribed by the WCL.
   3.4. The finished capacity analysis, in the formats required by HQ AFMC/A4DM, will be
   reviewed at the group director level. Final approval will be at the wing level, prior to
   releasing the data call to HQ AFMC/A4DM.
