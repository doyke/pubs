SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This updates AFSOC policies and guidance regarding MPA man-day requirements management.
1. Introduction.
     1.1. The Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA) man-day program is governed by Title 10
     U.S.C., Section 12301(d) (h) and is compliance-oriented. It is a category of active duty
     assets used to provide voluntary Reserve Component support to AFSOC missions. Also
     known as Active Duty for Operational Support (ADOS), these days are allocated for
     operational missions. HQ USAF/A1MP authorizes MPA man-Days to AFSOC to facilitate
     emergent, non-recurring, short-term projects with skilled manpower assets which cannot be
     accomplished by available AFSOC-assigned personnel. Further, these tours are approved for
     the convenience of the government and are not designed to fill gapped billets or pay for
     missions already tasked to or funded to another MAJCOM or Air Reserve Component
     (ARC).
        1.1.1. Steady state days are funded through the active duty MilPERS account for pay and
        entitlements. These man-days typically support non-OCO Contingencies (such as
        responses to natural disasters), nuclear deterrence operations, new & emerging missions,
        non-OCO AEF support (RFF requests), total force initiatives where the active component
        has a shortfall, and short term augmentation (such as mil honors, med continuation or
        staff augmentation).
        1.1.2. Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) man-days are programmed through
        supplemental funding and are used to support requirements requested by Global
        Combatant Commanders in support of OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM.
        1.1.3. Additionally, 10 U.S.C., section 12304b gives service secretaries authority to
        involuntarily recall up to 60,000 reserve personnel in support of pre-planned missions for
        up to 365 continuous days. Unlike existing 12302 (OCO) mobilization authority, the
        12304b mobilizations must be budgeted for in year of execution. The Global SOF
        Campaign Plan sets the baseline for 12304b mobilization requirements.
     1.2. The HAF implemented Program Objective Memorandum (POM) process
     institutionalized a requirements based procedure, where AFSOC works closely with
AFSOCI38-201 7 AUGUST 2014                                                                     3


   commanders to identify valid MPA man-day requirements based on the AFSOC
   Commander’s defined priorities. The list of requirements is sorted based on these
   AFSOC/CC defined priorities and a panel selected by AFSOC/CV consisting of HQ
   AFSOC/A1M, CCR, and CCG will provide a recommendation to AFSOC/CV for final
   apportionment approval.
   1.3. This instruction formalizes AFSOC’s methodology to forecast, plan, program, and fund
   MPA man-day accounts in our budget building process.
2. Purpose.
   2.1. This instruction defines the process, roles, and responsibilities for the management,
   allocation, and execution of the MPA officer and enlisted man-day program.
   2.2. Funds within the MPA allocated for the use of ARC personnel in support of active
   component (AC) missions are referred to as MPA man-days. The overarching purpose for
   MPA man-days is to provide the AF with skilled manpower to temporarily support active
   duty missions when AC capabilities are not available. These MPA man-days are also
   commonly referred to as Active Duty for Operational Support-Active Component (ADOS-
   AC). Use of MPA man-days must always be authorized under Title 10 U.S.C. activation
   statutes and are funded through annual congressional appropriation acts (U.S. Treasury
   "3500" account).
3. Appropriate Use of Man-Days.
   3.1. The overarching purpose for MPA man-days is to provide the Air Force with skilled
   temporary manpower to support Air Force missions when regular component resources are
   not available or sufficient. Commands, Staffs, and Agencies will utilize the MPA man-day
   program to access capabilities within the ARC to support operational missions. (T-1)
   3.2. MPA man-days are used for the following active duty requirement reasons: (T-1)
      3.2.1. Non-OCO Contingencies such as natural disasters, operations involving National
      security and homeland defense.
      3.2.2. Nuclear Deterrence operations.
      3.2.3. Non-OCO AEF support involving Request for Forces (RFF) from tasking
      agencies.
      3.2.4. Short Term Augmentation such as staff and wing augmentation requirements.
      3.2.5. The backfill of active duty AF personnel deployed.
      3.2.6. Short term RegAF projects where use of active duty personnel is not economical.
      3.2.7. Perform operational augmentation to RegAF missions such as SOF airlift support.
   3.3. Tours normally not approved for use of MPA man-days are: (T-1)
      3.3.1. To replace AC personnel on terminal or ordinary leave, routine TDY, or in school.
      3.3.2. To backfill Active Guard/Reserve (AGR) or statutory tour status personnel.
      3.3.3. To accomplish ARC missions, support, or special projects (Reserve Personnel
      Appropriation (RPA) to include organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing or
      training of Reserve components).
4                                                              AFSOCI38-201 7 AUGUST 2014


       3.3.4. To substitute for establishing a valid active duty authorization.
       3.3.5. For the sole purpose of performing additional or routine administrative duties or
       volunteer activities (e.g. CFC Project Officer, air shows, etc.).
       3.3.6. To fill a vacant RegAF position, unfunded RegAF position, or abolished civilian
       position.
       3.3.7. To fill a position/function where RC volunteer is the same person who normally
       performs this duty as a full time Federal Civil Service employee or government
       contractor.
       3.3.8. To meet mission requirements of another Command, Staff, or Agency (e.g. ACC
       MPA man-days cannot be used to support an AETC mission requirement). Exception:
       Centrally managed activities such as Legal and Intelligence.
       3.3.9. To attend upgrade training (e.g. AFSC training (officer or enlisted), formal school,
       PME seminars, technical training, contractor course (e.g. Franklin Quest), or courses
       offered at universities and high schools.
       3.3.10. Exclusively to attend conferences, workshops and seminars, except RC personnel
       filling General Officer positions.
       3.3.11. To participate in exercises unless they are augmenting an active component unit
       or serving as an evaluator.
       3.3.12. To cover vacancies created by active duty reassignment.
       3.3.13. To staff an office or unit when its manning level in the required AFSC exceeds
       90% and there is no "peak period workload".
4. Planning and Programming for Steady State Man-Days and 10 U. S.C. § 12304b
Mobilization Requirements (POM).
    4.1. Steady State POM Process.
       4.1.1. AFSOC implemented a requirements-based process to identify and validate all
       man-day requirements and is linked to the AF planning and programming process. MPA
       man-day requirements are vetted through AFSOC senior leadership for approval and
       linked to resource apportionment decisions. This process ensures validated and approved
       requirements are appropriately funded to support AFSOC requirements and commanders’
       priorities.
       4.1.2. HAF, through HQ AFSOC/A1M, will issue a steady state man-day data call for
       the next POM cycle (i.e. submit FY16-20 requirements in CY 14). AFSOC commanders
       and directors submit requirements based on established AFSOC Commander priorities.
       Each request must clearly describe the active duty task required and linked to an
       AFSOC/CC priority.
       4.1.3. Once submissions from commanders and directors are received, they will be
       consolidated and ranked using the AFSOC/CC prioritized list (attachment 3) and other
       commander directed initiatives that might arise (i.e. known emergent requirements).
       Note: Submissions will be returned if specific justification and requested data is not
       provided.
AFSOCI38-201 7 AUGUST 2014                                                                    5


     4.1.4. The panel will review and assess the prioritized list to eliminate duplicate efforts
     and ensure appropriate use of steady-state man-days. Each requirement will be reviewed
     and recommendations annotated on the listing.
     4.1.5. AFSOC/CV will review the list and consider each recommendation. AFSOC/CV
     is the final approval authority for submission of all man-day requirements to HAF.
  4.2. 10 U. S.C. § 12304b Mobilization Process.
     4.2.1. USC section 12304b gives service secretaries authority to involuntarily recall up to
     60,000 reserve personnel in support of CCDR pre-planned missions for up to 365
     continuous days. Unlike existing 12302 (OCO) mobilization authority; the 12304b
     mobilizations must be budgeted for in year of execution.
     4.2.2. HAF, through HQ AFSOC/A1M, will issue a 12304b requirement data call in
     conjunction with the steady state man-day data call for the next POM cycle. HQ
     AFSOC/A1M will request the AFSOC/OC provide the 12304b requirements for the
     command as the AFSOC/OC receives and coordinates all SOF mobilization/
     demobilization and rescission requests with G-MAJCOMs and the respective AFRC
     components.
     4.2.3. AFSOC/OC, through their own process, will identify combatant commander
     preplanned mission requirements that require mobilization under U.S.C. § 12304b and
     submit the requirements to HQ AFSOC/A1M for submission to the POM through the
     steady state data call. (T-2)
     4.2.4. The data call for 12304b should not duplicate existing man day data calls. The
     12304b input only identifies “pre-planned missions” against which AFSOC may
     determine that a unit mobilization would be required to ensure adequate levels of reserve
     support could be ordered.
     4.2.5. Once the 12304b submission from AFSOC/OC is received, it will be combined
     with the steady state man-day data for the AFSOC/CV’s panel review and submitted to
     AFSOC/CV for review and consideration for submission each recommendation the POM
     cycle: Submissions will be returned if specific justification and requested data is not
     provided.
     4.2.6. The panel will review and assess the prioritized list to eliminate duplicate efforts
     and ensure appropriate use of steady-state man-days. Each requirement will be reviewed
     and recommendations annotated on the listing. (T-2)
     4.2.7. AFSOC/CV will review the list and consider each recommendation. AFSOC/CV
     is the final approval authority for submission of all man-day requirements to HAF.
  4.3. Roles and Responsibilities.
     4.3.1. HQ AFSOC/A1M.
         4.3.1.1. Provide MPA man-day program oversight. (T-1)
         4.3.1.2. Develop specific guidance on appropriate POM submission criteria.
         4.3.1.3. Provide data collection tools to submitting agencies which meets AFSOC
         unique priorities and AF mandatory fields.

AFSOCI38-201 7 AUGUST 2014                                                                  7


5. Budget Year For Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Man-Days.
   5.1. Process.
      5.1.1. AFSOC receives the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance from
      HAF which provides the latest OCO criteria.
      5.1.2. HAF will task AFSOC for a data call to meet the AF Personnel Budget Review
      Committee (PBRC) board. HAF consolidates all MAJCOM inputs and uses a particular
      data format for submission. The data requested is for the next FY. AFSOC commanders
      and directors submit requirements to HQ AFSOC/A1M when tasked via data call to meet
      tasked timelines. Inputs will be based on established OMB priorities such as deployment,
      Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), direct support, and backfill for
      active duty deployed members. (T-2)
      5.1.3. Once submissions from the commanders and directors are received, HQ
      AFSOC/A1M will consolidate the submissions, ensuring each line clearly describes the
      active duty OCO task required for funding and is distinctly linked to an OMB Priority.
      Submissions not meeting these criteria are returned. Additionally, submissions must
      include the number of personnel filling each requirement and the months the
      requirements will be executed.
      5.1.4. HQ AFSOC/A1M develops a recommended prioritization listing based on OMB
      mandated priorities and other commander directed tasks (i.e. - known emergent OCO
      requirements). (T-2)
      5.1.5. The OCO prioritized list is then reviewed and assessed for validity through the
      panel. Each requirement will be reviewed and recommendations annotated on the listing.
      5.1.6. AFSOC/CV will review this list and consider each recommendation. AFSOC/CV
      is the final approval authority for submission of all OCO man-day requirements to HAF.
   5.2. Roles and Responsibilities.
      5.2.1. HQ AFSOC/A1M.
          5.2.1.1. Provide MPA man-day program oversight. (T-2)

          5.2.1.3. Provide data collection tools to submitting agencies which meets OMB
          mandated priorities and AF mandatory fields.
          5.2.1.4. Develop an initial prioritized list of man-day requirements for command
          review.
          5.2.1.5. Submits final AFSOC/CV approved OCO data listing to HAF.
      5.2.2. Commanders and Directors.
          5.2.2.1. Identify OCO requirements that cannot be temporarily met with active duty
          personnel. (T-2)
          5.2.2.2. Ensure data is submitted to HQ AFSOC/A1M in the appropriate format and
          contains a complete requirement description, matched to a listed OMB priority. (T-2)
      5.2.3. Man-Day Functional Managers (FAMs).

           submitted requirements are not duplicated and accurately reflect OMB priorities. (T-
           2)
           5.2.3.4. Monitor man-day budgets in the appropriate proprietary man-day
           management system (CMAS/M4S). (T-1)
        5.2.4. Review and Assessment Panel.
           5.2.4.1. The panel reviews each requirement on the recommended prioritized list
           based on the following criteria; alignment with OMB criteria, potential duplicate
           entries, and appropriate use of man-days (IAW AFI 36-2619 and Appendix A).
           5.2.4.2. Provide recommendations, where appropriate, on those OCO requirements
           which need further AFSOC/CV decision for approval.
        5.2.5. AFSOC/CV.
           5.2.5.1. Reviews requirements on the panel recommended prioritized list and
           considers their recommendations.
           5.2.5.2. Approves the OCO prioritized list either in whole or in part.
6. Steady State and OCO Execution Year.
     6.1. Apportionment Process (following allocation of days by HAF).
        6.1.1. Once HAF allocates man-days based on the processes described in sections 4 and
        5 of this instruction, commanders and directors will have the opportunity to review their
        previously submitted and approved requirements for changed priorities and additional
        mission needs.
        6.1.2. AFSOC commanders and directors submit updated/new requirements to HQ
        AFSOC/A1M. As in previous submissions, these additional inputs will be based on
        established AFSOC/CC priorities (Appendix B). (T-2)
        6.1.3. Once submissions from the commanders and directors are received, they will be
        consolidated and ranked IAW the AFSOC/CC prioritized mission list and other
        commander directed initiatives (i.e. known emergent requirements). Note: Submissions
        will be returned if specific justification and requested data is not provided.
        6.1.4. The panel will review and assess the prioritized list to eliminate duplicate efforts
        and ensure appropriate use of steady-state man-days. Each requirement will be reviewed
        and recommendations annotated on the list.
        6.1.5. AFSOC/CV will review the list and consider each recommendation for
        apportionment of HAF allocated man-days to the appropriate Command Man-day
        Allocation System (CMAS) budget areas.
AFSOCI38-201 7 AUGUST 2014                                                                  9


        6.1.5.1. The command will initially withhold 10% of the steady state budget, officer
        and enlisted man-days, to accommodate emergent requirements that arise between
        quarterly man-day execution reviews. (T-2)
        6.1.5.2. Steady State man-days will be issued only for the next executing quarter
        (Exception: AFRC members on PCS orders filling approved tours over 180 days).
        OCO man-days will be issued for the entire length of the deployment. (T-2)
  6.2. Steady State and OCO Mid-year Review.
     6.2.1. HAF directs a mid-year review for both steady state and OCO man-days.
     MAJCOMs are tasked to justify their balance and identify new requirements for the
     remainder of the FY. AFSOC’s mid-year balance of unobligated man-days and any new
     requirements will be reviewed by HAF to determine if additional man-days are warranted
     for funding, or if AFSOC can reprioritize from within the confines of the remaining
     allocation. In the event AFSOC has excess officer and/or enlisted man-days that cannot
     be executed during the FY, they will be returned to HAF to ensure 100% execution of our
     total allocation.
     6.2.2. As in previous data calls, a task will be sent to commanders and directors
     requesting data on those requirements that have not yet been obligated, usually between
     April and September of the execution fiscal year. This is a bottom up review, without
     regard to whether they are additional or previously authorized requirements. (T-2)
     6.2.3. Once submissions from commanders and directors are received, HQ AFSOC/A1M
     will consolidate the requirements, ensuring each line clearly describes the active duty
     task required for funding and is distinctly linked to an AFSOC/CC priority for steady
     state, or OMB guidance for OCO. Submissions not meeting these criteria are returned.
     Additionally, submissions must include the number of personnel filling each requirement
     and the months the requirements will be executed.
     6.2.4. HQ AFSOC/A1M develops a new recommended prioritization list based on
     AFSOC/CC priorities and other commander directed initiatives (i.e. known emergent
     requirements).
     6.2.5. The prioritized list is reviewed and assessed for validity by the panel. Each
     requirement will be reviewed and recommendations annotated on the list.
     6.2.6. AFSOC/CV will review this list and consider each recommendation. AFSOC/CV
     is the final approval authority for submission of mid-year review man-day requirements
     to HAF.
     6.2.7. HAF will notify AFSOC of the results of the mid-year review, and may approve
     all, some, or none of the requested additional days. If additional days are approved, the
     tasked timeline will account for the command apportionment process, where
     reprioritization may be necessary based on the remaining AFSOC balance.
     6.2.8. AFSOC/CV will communicate the results of the mid-year review to the command.

   6.3. Quarterly Execution Reviews.
      6.3.1. During the months of December, March, Jun, and Sep, HQ AFSOC/A1MW will
      provide commanders, AFSOC directors and the review panel a report illustrating
      AFSOC’s rate of man-day execution for the previous quarter.
      6.3.2. If necessary, the review panel will recommend reapportionment of unexecuted
      man-days to other requirements.
      6.3.3. If applicable, AFSOC/CV will review and approve the reapportionment
      recommendation.
      6.3.4. If reapportionment is approved, AFSOC/CV will communicate them to the
      command.
7. Emergent Requirements.
   7.1. Emergent requirements outside the AFSOC/CV approved prioritization list will involve
   either reapportioning days to the new mission, or requesting additional man-days from HAF.
      7.1.1. Prior to requesting additional days from HAF, an analysis must be made to
      determine if the mission can be supported with AFSOC’s existing man-day balance. If
      the request is for steady state man-days, the withhold balance should be completely
      exhausted prior to contacting HAF for additional days (see figure 7.1 or figure 7.2 for
      OCO).
      7.1.2. HQ AFSOC/A1MW will prepare a report to display under-executed man-days by
      requirement and potential unused days, for advisement to the panel for reapportionment
      recommendation to AFSOC/CV.
      7.1.3. AFSOC/CV will review and approve the recommendation or authorize a request to
      HAF for additional man-days.
          7.1.3.1. The request to HAF will be submitted by HQ AFSOC/A1M and must
          include authoritative documentation for reference, such as a RFF, tasking order, or
          other pertinent orders for the specific AFSOC AFRC capability.

                                OCO USE OF MAN-DAYS:

The overarching purpose for OCO MPA Man-days is to provide the Air Force with skilled
temporary manpower to support the Air Force’s mission in overseas contingency operations.

Appropriate Use:

   1. Active Duty for Operational Support (ADOS) required to meet deployed requirements to
      AOR: ARC members filling a valid unit line number (ULN) for Operation Enduring
      Freedom (OEF).
      AFSOC EXAMPLE: 919 SOW MEMBER DEPLOYING TO FILL A CJSOAC
      REQUIREMENT FOR ONE ROTATION.

   2. ADOS required to support ISR actions. The following three criteria must be met:
        a. ARC members filling a valid ULN in direct support of OEF / OND from home
           station or another intermediate location outside of the AOR (E.G., Predator
           Operators, Distributed Common Ground System, etc.),
        b. The “direct support” relationship should be indisputable,
        c. War-related requirements exceed the AC’s war effort capability.
      AFSOC EXAMPLE: USE OF 2 SOS TO FLY A CAP

   3. ADOS required to support deployment operations, or providing indisputable direct
      support to OEF operations.
      AFSOC EXAMPLE: DIRECT SUPPORT SUCH AS AN OPERATIONS CENTER
      OR UNIT ACTIONS TO SUPPORT A MOBILIZATION

   4. ADOS required to backfill essential AC members who are deployed forward in support
      of OEF: ARC members required to backfill those AC personnel deployed for 365-days or
      more and/or those AC personnel in “one deep positions,” like Commanders or
      Comptrollers.
      AFSOC EXAMPLE: BACKFILL OF AN ACTIVE DUTY MEMBER FILLING A
      VALID ULN

Tours normally not approved:

          a. To man staff positions without direct support specifically tied to OEF
          b. Deployments not classified as OEF or support for other contingencies NOT OEF
          c. Loosely tying a requirement to OCO because a member from the same office is
             deployed

*SPECIAL NOTE FOR OCO MAN-DAYS: BASED ON BUDGETARY RESTRAINTS AT THE
BEGINNING OF EACH FY, HAF MAY DICTATE THAT OCO DAYS ONLY BE USED FOR
DEPLOYMENTS OR RPA OPERATIONS UNTIL SUCH AF-LEVEL REVIEW MAY INDICATE
ALL AF REQUIREMENTS ARE ABLE TO BE FUNDED.
