                                            Chapter 1

                                   REPORTING FOR DUTY

1.1. Overview. The purpose of this AFMAN is to describe the organization, duties and
procedures for flight operations, weapons, vehicles, and communications equipment
requirements. Traditional and non-traditional ground threats could include, but are not limited to,
crime, espionage, hostile surveillance, sabotage, subversion, civil unrest, terrorism,
irregular/unconventional warfare, and conventional warfare. Security Forces provide the
foundation of the Integrated Defense (ID) concept. This section outlines minimum security.
NOTE: Security Forces and ID forces (augmentee personnel should not be included in base
details if their duty schedule is in excess of the majority of the base populace.
1.2. Reporting for Duty. All personnel must report for duty fit and prepared to assume their
assigned post. Each of the following paragraphs addresses areas of concern for members
reporting for duty.
1.3. Maintain appropriate Air Force Physical Fitness and Weight Standards. It is each
Defender’s responsibility to maintain appropriate levels of physical conditioning and weight
control. Security Forces members must be ready, willing and able, at any random moment, to
perform physically demanding tasks under sometimes harsh, unforgiving, unpredictable, and
often life threatening conditions.      Maintaining proper fitness is essential to mission
accomplishment and survivability of our Defenders. Failure to maintain an appropriate level of
physical conditioning can result in adverse administrative action. Information regarding current
fitness standards and required frequency of assessments can be found in Chapter 3 of AFI 10-
248, The Air Force Fitness Program.
1.4. Maintain Proper Qualifications for Assigned Post. Supervisors and their members must
ensure individuals possess all qualifications and certifications to perform duties in their assigned
post. Examples include: vehicle and weapon qualifications and required certifications for
specific duty posts.
1.5. Possess Required Equipment. Supervisors and their members must ensure individuals
possess equipment required for the assigned post. Squadrons should develop and maintain a list
of required equipment for all posts based on their specific mission. Examples include: helmet,
gas mask, restricted area badge, ballistic vest, etc.
1.6. Arming and Equipping Security Forces. Arming will be IAW AFI 31-207, Arming and
Use of Force by Air Force Personnel and AFI 31-101, Integrated Base Defense, MAJCOM
requirements, and as required by the Integrated Defense Council (IDC).
     1.6.1. Minimum Equipment Requirements. Posted Security Forces must be equipped with
     the following:
        1.6.1.1. Whistle

       1.6.1.9. Law Enforcement Equipment (LEE)
       1.6.1.10. Defensor Fortis Load Carrying System (DFLBS)
1.7. Arming and Equipping Support Forces. Staff, recalled or augmentation forces may be
required for some contingencies. When posted, personnel will carry equipment required for the
duty for which they are posted. If the post is not in support of Protection Level (PL) 1, 2 or 3
resources, MAJCOM designates arming and equipment requirements.
1.8. Security Forces Vehicles. Air Provost vehicles are specifically purchased/leased for Air
Provost/police duties. Air Provost sedans should not be used on the flight line if at all possible.
Other vehicle requirements will be in accordance with AFI 31-101, Intergrated Defense and
transportation directives.
   1.8.1. Leasing Security Forces Vehicles. When contracts are negotiated to lease vehicles for
   Security Forces use, ensure the requirement to drill holes for mounting of prisoner cages,
   lights, sirenss, communication equipment and any other specialized items is written into the
   contract. Marking requirements should also be addressed. Ensure marking of security/law
   enforcement vehicles complies with TO 36-1-191
1.9. Fitness for Duty. Security Forces and augmentee personnel must adhere to the following:
   1.9.1. Be mentally alert.
   1.9.2. Abstain from consumption of alcoholic beverages within 8 hours of duty or an
   additional amount of time if the alcohol influences the member’s capability to perform their
   duties.
   1.9.3. Inform supervisor of prescription and non-prescription drugs that might impair duty
   performance.
   1.9.4. Inform supervisor of any mental distractions caused by unusual stress or crisis.
1.10. Security Forces Organization. All Security Forces units have an S-3/operations echelon.
The S-3/operations branch provides the installation with Air Provost, physical security,
corrections, investigations, patrols, entry control, and resource protection. For additional
information refer to AFMAN 31-201, Volume 1, Security Forces History and Organization.
1.11. Security Forces. Installation Security Forces consist primarily of Air Force active duty,
Air Reserve, Air National Guard, and Department of the Air Force Civilian Security Forces
police/guards and when needed, augmentees. Augmentees are personnel identified through the
Intregrated Defense (ID) Duty Program.
   1.11.1. Selection and Use of ID Forces as Security Forces Members. Commanders must
   identify and use only those personnel who are considered highly responsible and completely
   reliable for Security Forces duty. Commanders will monitor ID Forces to assure continued

   reliability. AFPAM 10-243, (ID Forces) Augmentation Duty, contains detailed information
   on selection, training and administration of personnel. EXCEPTION: ANG installations
   must meet the minimum ANG training requirements identified in AFI 36-2225, Security
   Forces Training and Standardization Evaluation Programs.
   1.11.2. Security Forces Qualifications. Airman classification program directives detail career
   prerequisites for Security Forces personnel. ID Duty directives detail prerequisites for
   augmentees.
1.12. Security Forces Composition and Responsibilities. Security Forces support Air Force
operational resources and missions worldwide. On-duty Security Forces response elements are
required for areas containing Protection Level (PL) resources. They form the major capability for
detecting, responding to and neutralizing hostile actions under normal and emergency conditions.
Security flights may vary in size depending upon the mission of the Security Forces. Members of
each flight must know their individual responsibilities and must also have a working knowledge
of all positions within the security flight.
   1.12.1. Flight Commanders. When authorized, an officer will provide oversight of each
   flight. They are responsible for all the flight does or fails to do to include: training and
   equipping personnel and the conduct and welfare of the flight both on and off duty. They
   must know each person assigned to the flight, especially his/her strengths and weaknesses.
   Flight Sergeants assist them in handling time consuming and difficult problems of command
   interest. Flight Commanders must arrive at least 30 minutes prior to the start of their tour of
   duty. Flight Commanders provide oversight of each flight through analysis of the Integrated
   Defense Risk Management Program (IDRMP).
   1.12.2. Flight Sergeants. Flight Sergeants supervise and operate the flight during normal and
   emergency conditions. They are responsible for all the flight does or fails to do. They must
   know each person assigned to the flight, especially his or her strengths and weaknesses. They
   are responsible for the basic operation and administrative functions of the flight. Like the
   Flight Commander, they ensure the proper level of individual and collective training to
   accomplish the flight mission. Flight Sergeants assume the duties of Flight Commanders
   when absent or not authorized. Flight Sergeants’ provide oversight of each flight through
   analysis of the Integrated Defense Risk Management Program (IDRMP).
       1.12.2.1. Flight Sergeants are responsible for preparing and posting duty schedules and
       scheduling leaves.
       1.12.2.2. Preparation for Duty. Flight Sergeants must arrive at least 30 minutes prior to
       the start of their tour of duty. Confer with the Flight Sergeant being relieved, review
       blotters from previous shifts, and get a thorough briefing on the current status of security
       operations. Check the status of vehicles, communications equipment, availability of grid
       maps, checklists and any other equipment personnel will need during their tour of duty.
       1.12.2.3. Post Checks. Flight Sergeants or Flight Commanders should check each sentry
       at least once during their tour of duty.
   1.12.3. Squad Leaders. Squad Leaders are responsible for all the squad does or fails to do.
   Squad Leaders supervise and are responsible for ensuring the collective training of the squad
   and individual training. Training includes on-the-job and proficiency training requirements.
   Squad leaders will supervise squads based upon site-specific Mission, Enemy, Terrain and
AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010                                                        11


  weather, Troops and support available, Time available, Civil considerations (METT-TC)
  factors; thorough analysis of the Integrated Defense Risk Management Process (IDRMP);
  and the ID force’s ability to anticipate, deter, detect, assess, warn, defeat, delay, defend and
  recover.
  1.12.4. Area Supervisors. Area Supervisors are senior ID force members assigned to a
  specific Area of Operation (AO). They direct and manage the area security operation in
  support of PL resources and monitor the well being of forces posted in the area. They must
  check every posted ID force member as frequently as possible. NOTE: In small areas where
  it is not prudent to post a lone individual, the internal or external Special Reaction Team
  (SRT) leader may also serve as Area Supervisor. Area Supervisors will supervise their areas
  based upon site-specific METT-TC factors, thorough analysis of the IDRMP, and the ID
  force’s ability to anticipate, deter, detect, assess, warn, defeat, delay, defend and recover.
  1.12.5. Entry Controllers (ECs). ECs control entry to restricted areas. They perform duties
  in one of the most sensitive positions in the Air Force Installation Security Program. They
  must apply controls that ensure only authorized personnel are admitted to restricted areas.
  They accomplish this using the procedures in Air Force directives and MAJCOM
  supplements.
  1.12.6. Assistant ECs. Assistant ECs may be posted to conduct vehicle and personnel
  searches and assist ECs as needed or required.
  1.12.7. FT Leaders. FT leaders are responsible for all the FT does or fails to do. They
  directly supervise team members. FT leaders are responsible for the collective training of the
  FT and individual training of FT members. Training includes on-the-job and proficiency
  training requirements. FT leaders will supervise the FT based upon site-specific METT-TC
  factors, thorough analysis of the IDRMP, and their ability to anticipate, deter, detect, assess,
  warn, defeat, delay, defend and recover.
  1.12.8. FT. FTs consist of four Security Forces members on one team, or any combination
  of internal and external SRTs, and security patrols who come together to form a FT. FTs
  respond to situations involving protection level resources and may work in smaller teams.
  1.12.9. Security Response Team (SRT). SRTs are required at all installations supporting PL
  1, 2, or 3 resources. Typically, SRTs are response elements consisting of two properly
  trained, armed and equipped ID force members. They provide internal and external security
  response for restricted areas containing protection level resources. SRTs will respond based
  upon site-specific METT-TC factors, thorough analysis of the Intragrated Defense Risk
  Management Planning (IDRMP), and their ability to anticipate, deter, detect, assess, warn,
  defeat, delay, defend and recover.
     1.12.9.1. Internal SRTs. Internal SRTs (ISRTs) may be dedicated to the interior of a
     restricted area, observe assigned resources and provide immediate response to alarms
     generated from Intrusion Detection System (IDS) or personnel and incidents. ISRTs must
     be capable of responding immediately, as defined in the Intregrated Defense Plan (IDP),
     to defeat the adversary before any negative effect against the resource occurs. NOTE: To
     facilitate area coverage and response to alarms, two-person internal SRTs may be
     separated and work as single-person security patrols within their assigned area.

         1.12.9.1.1. Security Patrols. Security patrols (internal SRTs separated into single-
         person response elements) may be dedicated to the interior of a restricted area or an
         individual resource. Security patrols observe assigned resources and provide
         immediate response to alarms generated from IDS or personnel and incidents.
         Security patrols must be capable of responding immediately, as defined in the IDP, to
         defeat the adversary before any negative effect against the resource occurs.
     1.12.9.2. External SRTs. External SRTs (ESRTs) may operate inside or outside of the
     restricted areas to which they are assigned. ESRTs observe assigned resources and
     provide immediate response to alarms generated from IDS or personnel and incidents.
     ESRTs must be capable of responding immediately, as defined in the IDP, to defeat the
     adversary before any negative effect against the resource occurs. NOTE: If approved by
     the Intregrated Defense Counsel (IDC), two-person external SRTs may be separated and
     work as single-person security patrols within their assigned area in order to facilitate area
     coverage and response to alarms. If separated, the two security patrols must join together
     to respond to alarms in the restricted area.
  1.12.10. Close Boundary Sentry (CBS). CBSs are posted to provide security surveillance
  over the boundary of restricted areas or individual resources. IDS performs this function
  when available.
  1.12.11. Immediate Visual Assessment (IVA) Sentries. IVA sentries provide surveillance
  over IDS sectors or zones when closed circuit television (CCTV) systems fail or when an
  alarm monitor can’t see because of poor visibility or blind zones.
  1.12.12. Electronic Security Systems Operator (ESSO). This position was previously called
  the Master Surveillance Control Facility Operator (MSCFO). ESSOs operate IDS equipment
  used to secure protection level resources in restricted areas, dispatch Security Forces to
  alarms and make initial notifications. They must be thoroughly trained in proper operating
  procedures, remain alert to detect any irregularities and respond appropriately when action is
  called for. PL resources are so important that mistakes in attentiveness and unsupported
  assumptions cannot be allowed. They perform the following functions:
     1.12.12.1. Assess exterior IDS by line-of-sight or CCTV.
     1.12.12.2. Act as a subordinate C3 (command, control and communication) control
     center for Security Forces posted during normal operations.
     1.12.12.3. Control entry into structures, alert shelters and individual resources protected
     with IDS when there is not an alarm monitor for the area.
  1.12.13. Alarm Monitors. Alarm monitors are required to monitor IDS systems, dispatch
  Security Forces to alarms and make initial notifications. They may control entry to alarmed
  storage structures, alert aircraft shelters and other facilities protected by IDS and are key
  personnel in the process. Clear thinking, good operating procedures between alarm monitors
  and using organizations and a thorough familiarity with owner unit work routines are
  necessary to maintain efficiency and security. They must be thoroughly trained in proper
  operating procedures, remain alert to detect any irregularities and respond appropriately
  when action is called for.

  1.12.14. Security Forces Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC)/Emergency
  Communications Center (ECC) Controllers (formerly known as Security Forces Controller
  Center). BDOC/ECC controllers direct Security Forces during normal and emergency
  security operations. Persons assigned to this position must be of the highest caliber because
  the job is one of the most demanding and critical in the career field. BDOC/ECC controllers
  have the following responsibilities:
     1.12.14.1. Operate the communications console and equipment.
     1.12.14.2. Implement the security reporting and alerting system, when required.
     1.12.14.3. Plot the locations of all Security Forces and PL resources.
     1.12.14.4. Accomplish required reports and other administrative duties.
     1.12.14.5. Focal point for command, control, and communications for all Air Provost
     functions. Responsible for operating the communications network, monitoring resource
     protection alarms, if an alarm monitor is not posted, and documenting all incidents
     throughout the shift. The BDOC/ECC controller is the primary point of contact for the
     public and takes initial action regarding all reported incidents or emergencies
  1.12.15. Military Working Dog (MWD) Teams. Security of Protection Level resources is
  one of the most important uses of MWD teams. They are key players in a proactive security
  environment and should be used on a recurring basis to enhance detection and deterrence
  capabilities. MWD teams can operate independently or integrate with IDS and posted
  sentries, while providing search, initial response and force multiplier capabilities. MWDs
  should be used in installation security operations in the following ways: NOTE: Unless
  performing observation or listening post duties, MWDs should not normally be placed on
  static posts as this will seriously degrade the dog’s detection capability.
     1.12.15.1. Sweeps of exterior and interior areas of observation and concealment, and
     avenues of approach to installations and restricted or controlled areas. Exterior sweeps
     should be conducted randomly, so as not to establish a pattern and extend beyond the
     immediate area of resources, possibly as far out as 1000 meters. This is dependent upon
     terrain features, physical location of resources and current threat analysis. All exterior
     sweeps which is in exclusive jurisdiction must be coordinated with local police forces.
     Interior sweeps should also be conducted on a random basis.
     1.12.15.2. Conduct random vehicle inspections at installation, restricted area or
     controlled area entry control points using explosive detector dogs.
     1.12.15.3. Use as response elements to enhance internal and external intruder detection
     capabilities.
     1.12.15.4. To clear an area after an emergency response, ensuring all personnel have
     departed.
     1.12.15.5. To conduct sector searches for intruders after they have breached installation,
     restricted or controlled area perimeters.
     1.12.15.6. Conduct sweeps of areas surrounding the hard stands or parking ramps for
     aircraft.
     1.12.15.7. To conduct checks of storage structures.

      1.12.15.8. During recapture or recovery operations, MWDs may accelerate surrender of
      intruders and significantly reduce the chance of collateral damage resulting from
      weapons fire.
      1.12.15.9. During increased Force Protection Conditions (FPCONs) or security
      operations, MWDs can be used with motorized patrols, as distant support sentries and on
      normal day-to-day security and Air Provost posting to enhance detection and deterrence
      capabilities.
      1.12.15.10. Patrol. Increased detection capabilities of the canine are an invaluable tool
      during the hours of darkness or limited visibility.
      1.12.15.11. IAW AFI 31-202, Military Working Dog Program, to facilitate their
      detection specialty explosive detector dogs will be used during bomb threats and random
      antiterrorism measures (RAMs) to search for explosives. Narcotic detector dogs will be
      used to search for illegal drugs.
      1.12.15.12. MWD teams are excellent crime prevention tools. Visibility during daylight
      hours may deter criminals.
   1.12.16. Installation Entry Controller. Regulates vehicle and pedestrian entry and exit at
   assigned posts. Personnel assigned to this duty verify requests for visitor entry; issue visitor
   passes, and enforce the installation traffic code. Entry controllers may search and inspect
   personnel and vehicles, as directed by higher authority. As Air Force ambassadors,
   installation entry controllers play a vital role on Air Force installations. Chapter 4 contains a
   detailed description of the installation entry control function.
   1.12.17. Base Installation Patrols. Base installation Security Forces patrols perform a
   myriad of duties for PL 4 resources and respond to PL 1, 2 and 3 resources, when needed.
   Patrols supervise traffic, investigate accidents, issue citations, and apprehend violators. Base
   installation patrols conduct building checks, funds escorts, and initial investigation of
   incidents not related to traffic. Patrols may assist the S2E/investigations section or AFOSI.
   Do not use installation patrols to perform other duties as this weakens the overall force
   protection posture of the ID program. As a limited resource, installation patrols cannot be
   dispatched to every call from the public. Alternative call-handling procedures should be
   implemented for minor (non-disabling and non-injury) traffic accidents or for minor crimes
   where there is no evidence to be processed. This keeps the patrol free to respond to priority
   calls for service and true emergencies. It also frees up time for patrol personnel to interact
   with their customers and engage in problem-solving efforts. Walk-in reports at the
   BDOC/ECC, report-taking by appointment or report-taking by telephone (patrol member or
   clerical personnel) are examples of commonly-used alternatives to dispatching a patrol for
   every incident reported; mail-in reports and computer on-line reporting may also be used.
   The reporting guideline of the state in which a CONUS installation is located is one method
   of determining when a patrol should be dispatched and when an alternative method may be
   used.
1.13. Air Provost. Manages the wide range of general Air Provost services provided to the
installation. Those sections profiled below pertain to Air Provost:
   1.13.1. Corrections. Provides prisoner confinement, processing, supervision and program
   management.
AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010                                                           15


   1.13.2. Investigations. Primarily responsible for investigating crimes and incidents that
   require more detailed or specialized analysis which do not fall under Air Force Office of
   Special Investigations (AFOSI) purview. This section also maintains overall responsibility to
   safeguard crime scenes requiring release to AFOSI upon arrival on-scene. Investigators
   maintain chain of custody of property taken into evidence and dispose of the property after
   coordination with the staff judge advocate.
1.14. Duty Schedule. Defense Force Commander’s (DFC) determine unit flight schedules
based on unit needs. Normally a four-flight system is used to schedule security force members
for a “6 and 3” (work six days - off three days). Consider the following basic requirements when
developing flight schedules:
   1.14.1. The desired flight schedule is one with 8-hour shifts. However, due to the high
   deployment rate/contingencies, Security Forces may be required to work 12-hour shifts for
   an extended period of time at the discretion of the DFC.
   1.14.2. Flight schedules should provide periods for the completion of proficiency and
   recurring training requirements.
   1.14.3. Flight schedules should provide a schedule to allow members uninterrupted sleep
   while off duty to prepare for their next shift.
   1.14.4. Irrespective of the type of flight scheduling used, it is important that posts and patrols
   be manned according to the post priority listing. Tours of duty and time off should be
   commensurate with effective employment of Security Forces personnel.
   1.14.5. Scheduling. Post the flight duty roster in a prominent place, but consistent with
   sound Operations Security (OPSEC) practices. The duty roster should show the schedule and
   post for at least the next duty day. This advance notice gives each person the opportunity to
   ensure they report for duty in the correct uniform and with the proper equipment and to make
   any other necessary preparations for the post they will have that day.
1.15. Military Standardized Uniforms.
   1.15.1. Security Forces personnel are required to have the specific equipment on their duty
   gear. Local policy may dictate exact location of the above items.
       1.15.1.1. 9mm Handgun. The black Air Force Law Enforcement Ensemble (LEE) will
       be worn with the blue service uniform, battle dress uniform or Airmen’s Battle Uniform
       (ABU). The Olive Drab (OD) green LEE or ABU equivalent, built from standard issue
       OD green web gear (the first aid/utility pouch will be the handcuff case), may also be
       worn with the battle dress uniform. Shoulder holsters are not authorized for Security
       Forces personnel in uniform unless an exception is made in writing by the DFC. This
       exception is normally for personnel who are on medical waiver or who for other
       legitimate reasons cannot wear the standard LEE. These personnel shall wear the Bianchi
       UM84H harness with the M12 field holster. All personnel subject to this exception, will
       complete required training IAW AFI 36-2226. When armed with the 9mm handgun,
       DFCs will mandate at least one non-lethal use of force (Collapsible baton, TASER,
       and/or Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) Pepper Spray) be worn, handcuff with case (have the
       key readily available), radio with case, flashlight, ammo pouch, and first aid kit.
16                                   AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010


     1.15.1.2. M-4 or M-16 Rifle. When armed with an M-4 or M-16 rifle, Security Forces
     personnel are required to have the following equipment: issued rifle, Defense Force-Load
     Carrying System (DF-LCS), non-lethal use of force (Collapsible baton, TASER, and/or
     Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) Pepper Spray), handcuff with case (handcuff key readily
     available), radio with case and flashlight.
     1.15.1.3. MAJCOM/A7S and installation DFC will specify any additional equipment
     requirements. At each installation, uniform and equipment wear will be consistent for all
     Security Forces personnel as required by the type of weapon(s) the member carries.
     1.15.1.4. Mourning Bands. Mourning bands may be worn at the discretion of the DFC.
     1.15.1.5. SF Beret (in garrison): IAW AFI 36-2903, Position headband straight across
     the forehead, 1 inch above the eyebrows. Drape the top over the right ear. Align cloth
     flash above the left eye. Adjust ribbon for comfort, tie in a knot, and tuck inside or cut-
     off. Continue to wear SF shield and beret together while attending professional military
     education and recruiting duties.
        1.15.1.5.1. The SF cloth flash will be sewn (velcro may be used) to the center of the
        stiffener. The SF flash must be clean, ¼ inch above and parallel to the headband.
        Enlisted personnel wear the SF flash with SF insignia. Officers wear the plain (no
        insignia) SF flash, and affix regular size bright metal grade insignia centered on the
        flash. Wear BDU cap when a subdued appearance is required, or while in the field.
        1.15.1.5.2. SF Beret is worn only by SF personnel assigned to officer Air Force
        Specialty Code (AFSC) 31PX and enlisted AFSCs 3P0XX/A/B (or augmentees
        performing security forces duties when authorized by the DFC). EXCEPTION: Do
        not wear the shield with the Mess Dress Uniform. SF personnel working duty-out-of-
        control (i.e., SF member not assigned to a 31PX or 3P0XX billet) will not wear a SF
        beret or shield).
     1.15.1.6. Department of the Air Force (DAF) Guards/Police can refer to IC AFI 36-801,
     Uniforms for Civilian Employees, Chapter 3 for uniform requirements.

                                             Chapter 2

                                           GUARDMOUNT

2.1. Guardmount. Guardmount is a formal military formation and is the first call to duty for
Security Forces personnel. All flight members will draw weapons from the armory and be in
formation at the designated time and place. During guardmount, the flight commander or Flight
Sergeant should accomplish an inspection. Guardmount provides the flight leadership the
opportunity to ensure personnel; (1) are fit for duty, (2) comply with AFI 36-2903, Dress and
Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel, and (3) possess the required equipment and ensure
the equipment is in good working condition. The Flight Sergeant will conduct roll call to
announce and officially assign posts and disseminate information since this is (normally) the
only time the entire flight is together during any given tour of duty. Information disseminated
must include:
   2.1.1. Changes in procedures or new policy.
   2.1.2. Noted discrepancies.
   2.1.3. Upcoming appointments & commendations.
   2.1.4. Pick-up or restriction orders.
   2.1.5. Special emphasis on weapons and vehicle safety.
   2.1.6. Guardmount training.
   2.1.7. Events/incidents from the previous shift.
   2.1.8. Local Terrorist/Force Protection Conditions.
   2.1.9. Current duress words.
   2.1.10. Local information as needed.
2.2. Conducting the Formal Open Ranks Inspection. When tasked to conduct a formal open
ranks inspection, use the following procedures:
   2.2.1. Initial Actions. At the designated time, the Flight Sergeant will order the flight to
   “FALL IN”. The flight will fall in at attention and form three or four ranks (depending on the
   size of the flight) with the squad leaders at the right flank of each rank. The formation should
   be centered on the Flight Sergeant.
   2.2.2. Forming the Flight. The Flight Sergeant assumes a position six paces in front and
   facing the flight and gives the command, “REPORT”. Each squad leader salutes and reports,
   “SIR/MA’AM, FIRST SQUAD (second squad, and so forth) ALL PRESENT OR
   ACCOUNTED FOR” or “SIR/MA’AM, FIRST SQUAD, AIRMAN BROWN ABSENT”.
   The Flight Sergeant returns the salute of each squad leader. After the report, the Flight
   Sergeant gives the command, “PARADE, REST”. The Flight Sergeant then executes an
   about face, comes to parade rest, and waits for the inspecting official. As the inspecting
   official approaches, the Flight Sergeant comes to attention, executes an about face, and
   commands, “FLIGHT, TENCH HUT (ATTENTION)”. The Flight Sergeant then executes an
   about face and remains at attention until the inspecting official is three paces in front of, and
   facing him/her.
18                                    AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010


  2.2.3. Preparing for Inspection. As soon as the inspecting official is in position, the Flight
  Sergeant salutes and reports, “SIR/MA’AM, THE FLIGHT IS FORMED”. The inspecting
  official returns the salute and commands, “PREPARE FOR INSPECTION”. The Flight
  Sergeant executes an about face and commands, “OPEN RANKS, MARCH”. At this
  command, the first squad takes three paces forward, stops and immediately executes a dress
  right dress movement. The second squad takes two paces forward, stops and immediately
  executes a dress right dress movement. The third squad takes one pace forward, stops and
  immediately executes a dress right dress movement. The fourth squad stands fast and
  immediately executes a dress right. As the flight is executing the open ranks movement, the
  Flight Sergeant moves by the most direct route to the right flank of the first squad, one pace
  from, and facing the first squad leader. The Flight Sergeant then aligns the first squad by
  using voice commands only. To look down the front and rear of the squad, the Flight
  Sergeant executes sidesteps to the right and left (do not use arms to aim or weave from side
  to side to align the squads.) After the first squad is aligned, the Flight Sergeant executes a
  left face in marching and moves to the right flank of the second squad (one pace from and
  facing the second squad leader). The Flight Sergeant then aligns the remaining squads in the
  same fashion as the first.
  2.2.4. The Inspection. After the flight is aligned, the Flight Sergeant executes a right face in
  marching. He/she moves to a point three paces to the front of the first squad leader, halts,
  executes a left face and commands, “READY, FRONT”. The Flight Sergeant takes one pace
  forward, then executes a right face, salutes and reports, “SIR/MA’AM, THE FLIGHT IS
  PREPARED FOR INSPECTION”. The Flight Sergeant should now be positioned directly in
  front of the first squad leader. The inspecting official approaches the Flight Sergeant by the
  most direct route and inspects him/her. After inspecting the Flight Sergeant, the inspecting
  official directs the Flight Sergeant to “ACCOMPANY ME”. The inspecting official moves
  past the Flight Sergeant’s left shoulder toward the first squad leader. After the inspecting
  official is past, the Flight Sergeant executes an about face and follows two paces behind. The
  inspecting official moves by the most direct route to a point immediately in front of the first
  squad leader. The Flight Sergeant takes a position two paces behind and facing the
  inspecting official. The Flight Sergeant records any discrepancies noted by the inspecting
  official. The inspecting official inspects each member of the flight, beginning with the squad
  leader in the first rank. As the first squad leader is inspected, the Flight Sergeant gives the
  command, “SECOND, THIRD, AND FOURTH SQUADS, PARADE, REST”. Adjust this
  command based on the number of squads in formation.
     2.2.4.1. Inspecting Other Squads. After inspecting the squad leader, the inspecting
     official exe-cutes a right face in marching. He/she halts in front of the next flight
     member, executes a left face, inspects the next squad member and continues the
     procedure down the first rank. The Flight Sergeant follows the inspecting official by
     marching to a point directly in front of the last person inspected while still facing the
     inspecting official. After the inspecting official inspects the last flight member in the first
     squad, he/she executes a right face in marching, moves to the rear of the first squad by
     the most direct route, and inspects the rear of the squad. The inspecting official does not
     pause while moving along the rear of the squad unless a discrepancy is noted. The Flight
     Sergeant follows two paces behind the inspecting official. As the inspecting official
     approaches within six paces of the right flank of the formation, the second squad leader
AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010                                                          19


       commands, “SECOND SQUAD, TENCH HUT”. The inspecting official, followed by
       the Flight Sergeant, will proceed a few paces beyond the extreme right flank of the
       formation. At that point, he/she will execute a wide turn before reentering the right flank
       of the formation to inspect the second squad. This maneuver accommodates the
       requirement for the Flight Sergeant to remain in position behind the inspector and
       provides room to properly reenter the right flank of the formation.
       2.2.4.2. Completion. As the inspecting official begins to inspect the second squad
       leader, the first squad leader commands, “FIRST SQUAD, PARADE, REST”. Each
       squad leader follows this procedure. After the fourth (or last) squad is inspected, the
       inspecting official marches by the most direct route to a point six paces in front of and
       centered on, and facing the first squad. The Flight Sergeant will follow two paces behind
       the inspecting official and stop three paces beyond the first squad, execute a left face, and
       command, “FLIGHT, TENCH HUT”. The Flight Sergeant then takes one pace forward,
       executes a right face and remains at attention. If the inspecting official has any remarks to
       direct to the Flight Sergeant or the element, he/she does so now. When the inspecting
       official makes remarks, he/she tells the Flight Sergeant to place the flight at ease or
       parade rest. The Flight Sergeant executes an about face, gives the appropriate command,
       executes another about face and assumes the position of the command just issued.
       2.2.4.3. Close Ranks. When the inspecting official completes his/her remarks, the Flight
       Sergeant will come to attention, execute a left-face and give the flight the command,
       “FLIGHT, TENCH HUT”. The Flight Sergeant executes a right face and salutes the
       inspecting official, who returns the salute. The inspecting official orders, “TAKE
       CHARGE OF THE FLIGHT,” executes an appropriate facing movement and departs the
       area. The Flight Sergeant then executes a left face and gives the command “CLOSE
       RANKS, MARCH”. At this command the first squad stands fast. The second squad
       takes one pace forward and halts. The third squad takes two paces forward and halts.
       The fourth squad takes three paces forward and halts. Once the squads complete their
       movement, each squad automatically covers and remains at attention. While this is
       happening, the Flight Sergeant moves to a position six paces in front of, and centered on,
       the flight, and executes an about face. The Flight Sergeant then commands, “PARADE
       REST,” or “AT EASE”. At this point the Flight Sergeant will brief the flight, call roll
       and pass on information pertinent to the coming tour of duty. At the completion of the
       guardmount briefing, the Flight Sergeant commands, “FLIGHT TENCH HUT”. The
       flight comes to attention and the Flight Sergeant commands “POST”. At the command
       “POST,” the flight executes an about-face and members promptly report to their assigned
       duty posts.
2.3. Conducting Guardmount without an Inspection. There may be times when an
inspection is not practical or possible. Nevertheless, guardmount is a formal military formation
that is conducted as out-lined above. The only difference is not conducting the inspection (e.g.,
the flight is still formed, information disseminated and flight posted according to correct
protocol). Conclude guardmount without inspection the same as guardmount with inspection.
2.4. Eagle Eyes. After the 2001 terrorist attacks, the AF initiated a new program called Eagle
Eyes (EE). AFOSI has program oversight; however, Security Forces provides extensive support.
Eagle Eyes is essentially a large “neighborhood watch” program enlisting the eyes and ears of
the entire base community in the war on terror. It does so by educating people on what to
 20                                    AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010


recognize as potential terrorist planning activities and providing a 24-hour hot line to ensure
airmen or citizens who see something suspicious have reporting available. AFOSI and Security
Forces units work the details (how and where to accept incoming calls and how and when
Security Forces personnel relay the information to the local AFOSI unit) of the program at each
base. It is the on duty Flight Sergeant’s responsibility to ensure the flight is aware of these
categories of suspicious activities and knows to report them to AFOSI immediately when
observed or reported by someone else. The following are activities that all Air Force personneles
personnel should focus on recording, then reporting:
   2.4.1. Surveillance. The act of recording or monitoring activities. This may include the use
   of cameras (either still or video), note taking, drawing diagrams, annotating maps, or using
   binoculars and other vision-enhancing devices. Individuals drawing pictures or taking notes
   in an area not normally of interest to a standard tourist or showing interest in photographing
   security cameras, guard locations, or noticeably watching security reaction drills and
   procedures. In this manner, the terrorists intend to determine firsthand the effectiveness of
   search procedures and to gauge the alertness and reaction of security personnel. Terrorists
   conduct surveillance to determine a target’s suitability for attack by assessing the capabilities
   of existing security systems and discerning weaknesses for potential exploitation. Terrorists
   closely examine security procedures, such as shift changes, access control, and roving
   patrols; citizenship of security guards, models and types of locks; presence of closed-circuit
   cameras; and guard dogs. After identifying weaknesses, terrorists plan their attack options at
   the point or points of greatest vulnerability.
   2.4.2. Elicitation. People or organizations attempting to gain information about military
   operations, capabilities, or personnel. Elicitation attempts may be made by mail, fax,
   telephone or in person.
   2.4.3. Tests of Security. Any attempts to measure reaction times to security breaches or to
   penetrate physical security barriers or procedures in order to assess strengths and
   weaknesses. Terrorists may also employ aggressive surveillance by false phone threats,
   approaching security checkpoints to ask for directions, or “innocently” attempting to smuggle
   non-lethal contraband through checkpoints. Clearly, the terrorists intend to determine
   firsthand the effectiveness of search procedures and to gauge the alertness and reaction of
   security personnel.
   2.4.4. Acquiring supplies. Purchasing or stealing explosives, weapons, ammunition, etc.
   This may also include acquiring military uniforms, decals, flight manuals, passes or badges
   (or the equipment to manufacture such items) or any other controlled items.
   2.4.5. Suspicious/Out of Place persons. People who don’t seem to belong in the workplace,
   neighborhood, business establishment, or anywhere else. Includes suspicious border
   crossings and stowaways aboard ships or people jumping ship in port. This also includes:
       2.4.5.1. Multiple sightings of the same suspicious person, vehicle or activity, separated
       by time, distance or direction.
       2.4.5.2. Possible locations for observation post use.
       2.4.5.3. Individuals who stay at bus/train stops for extended periods while buses/trains
       come and go.
AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010                                                       21


     2.4.5.4. Individuals who carry on long conversations on pay or cellular telephones.
     2.4.5.5. Individuals who order food at a restaurant and leave before the food arrives or
     who order without eating.
     2.4.5.6. Joggers who stand and stretch for an inordinate amount of time.
     2.4.5.7. Individuals sitting in a parked car for an extended period of time.
     2.4.5.8. Individuals who don’t fit into the surrounding environment by wearing improper
     attire for the location or season.
     2.4.5.9. Individuals who exhibit unusual behavior such as staring or quickly looking
     away from individuals or vehicles as they enter or leave designated facilities or parking
     areas.
  2.4.6. Dry Run. Putting people into position and moving them around according to their
  plan without actually committing the terrorist act. This is especially true when planning a
  kidnapping, but it can also pertain to bombings. An element of this activity could also
  include mapping out routes and determining the timing of traffic lights and flow.
  2.4.7. Deploying Assets. People and supplies getting into position to commit the act. This is
  a person’s last chance to alert authorities before the terrorist act occurs.
  2.4.8. It is important to highlight that the above surveillance indicators can be recorded
  overtly during the performance of normal Security Forces activities. The intent is to raise the
  awareness of our Security Forces personnel to record and report anything unusual during the
  course of routine Air Provost and security duties. Reporting terrorist surveillance indicators,
  implementing effective security counter-measures and employing overt surveillance

                                SECURITY FORCES FORMS

3.1. AF Form 52, Evidence Tag. Use this form to record receipt or seizure of evidence or other
acquired property. Proper completion of the AF Form 52 ensures a proper chain of custody of
evidence for legal proceedings.
   3.1.1. Use AF Form 52 to record evidential or acquired property transactions. Proper
   completion of this form ensures proper chain of custody of evidence for legal proceedings
   and provides an accurate record of acquired property. The form is made up of two hard stock
   manila cards separated by a piece of carbon paper. The front sides of both copies are printed
   with the same information. The back side of the first copy contains the chain-of-custody and
   the back side of the second copy contains final disposition blocks. One AF Form 52 may be
   accomplished on each item or several items may be recorded on one form. Examples: One
   marijuana cigarette found on the back seat of an automobile would require one form, while
   four marijuana cigarettes found in the glove compartment of the same automobile could be
   placed in a single evidence bag and one form could be completed. The decision to use one
   form per item or to record several items per form is a decision based on the circumstances of
   the acquisition. To provide a record or receipt for the property, the property custodian uses
   permanently bound logbooks, one for evidence and the other for acquired property. The
   property custodian is usually an investigator in the investigations section. They will log the
   evidence or acquired property in when they receive it. This procedure will maintain proper
   chain-of-custody. When property is returned to the owner or otherwise disposed of, the
   person receiving or destroying the property will sign the AF Form 52, which will be retained
   in the Security Forces administration file. When used to record receipt of evidence or
   acquired property, the first copy of the form is affixed to the item and is used to include any
   future entries to ensure chain of custody.

3.6. AF Form 1176, Authority to Search and Seize. A search is an examination of a person,
property or premises to uncover evidence of a crime or to uncover evidence of a criminal intent,
such as stolen goods, burglary tools, weapons or other evidence. A seizure is the taking of such
items by authorities for evidence at a courts-martial or trial. To ensure the search and seizure is
legal and any evidence found is admissible at a courts-martial, AF Form 1176 is used to obtain
authorization for a search and seizure. This form is prepared for the signature of the commander
having search authority over a specific area, property or person to be searched. The commander
may give verbal authority to search only after a probable cause briefing to him/her is
accomplished and the situation warrants immediate search. The commander must sign the AF
Form 1176 (Attachment 14) as soon as possible after oral authorization. Once the form is
signed, Security Forces will retain and place it into the case file. Copies are made and forwarded
based on local requirements. A search authorization is not a search warrant. Search warrants are
an authority to search issued by civilian authorities only.

   search authority is desired. The statement should be written/typed on the back of the AF
   Form 1176 or on bond paper prior to contacting the authorizing commander. The probable
   cause statement should be written/typed exactly as given to the commander. If the
   commander asks further questions after being read the probable cause statement, the
   questions and the Security Force member’s response should be included. This may be used
   as evidence at later courts-martial to verify probable cause for the commander issuing the
   authority to search. (Attachment 15)

person, area under their control or personal possessions. Use this form to obtain the consent in
writing. Also, ensure the suspect and witnesses to the consent sign the appropriate blocks on the
form. When an AF Form 1364 is not available, document the consent on a plain piece of paper
as long as the individual signs it and it contains the time, date, persons and place(s) to be
searched. Ensure the person giving consent reads and fully understands that anything found in

3.10. AF Form 3226, Authority to Apprehend in Private Dwelling - Resident. The MCM,
Rule 302(e) requires written authority be obtained prior to apprehending a person in a private
dwelling. The AF Form 3226 is normally used to document receipt of this authority.
(Attachment 18)
   3.10.1. The Security Forces member requesting this authority will complete the top portion
   of the AF Form 3226. The installation commander or appointed magistrate will sign the
   block reserved for the authorizing official. Rule 302(e) defines “dwelling” as single-family
   houses, duplexes and apartments. Private dwellings DO NOT include living areas in military
   dormitories, tents, field encampments, etc. The form is self-explanatory. Write a Probable
   Cause statement (Attachment 15) on the reverse side of the form, detailing all information
   (facts and circumstances) about the incident.
   3.10.2. Prior written authority is not required if certain exigencies are present, i.e., if
   evidence or a perceived threat exist which could cause damage, harm or loss of life or the
   destruction of evidence would occur if the search wasn’t conducted at that time, etc. In these
   cases, written authority should be obtained the duty day following the apprehension.
   3.10.3. Prepare only one copy and retain it with the case file.
3.11. AF Form 3545(A), Incident Report. Guidelines on required items for the AF Form 3545
are outlined in the Uniform Federal Crime Reporting Act of 1988, which formed the basis of the
National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). Since the inception of NIBRS, two other
Congressional Acts, the Victim’s Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 and the Brady Handgun
Violence Prevention Act, also impacted the amount of data collected. NIBRS requires law
enforcement agencies, including the DoD, to report data to the Department of Justice (DoJ) for
inclusion in the FBI-maintained system. The DoD instituted the Defense Incident-Based
Reporting System (DIBRS), in order to meet the requirements of NIBRS. This is where the very
lengthy and detailed AF Form 3545 (A) comes into the picture. Use the form as a worksheet
while at the scene of an incident. This will ensure all the needed information is obtained.
   3.11.1. OVERVIEW: The form is electronic and should be accessed through the Security
   Forces Information Management System (SFMIS). If SFMIS is unavailable, a hard copy of
   the AF Form 3545 must be accomplished. On this copy, each offender/victim/witness will
   require a separate information page. For example there may be 3 offenders. Each will
   require his/her own information page. To better understand the design of the form, below is
   a broad-brush overview of each page followed by block-by-block instructions on how to fill
   out the form.
       3.11.1.1. PAGE 1, SECTION I and II, INCIDENT and OFFENSE INFORMATION:
       This page documents offense data, i.e. case number, time of incident, location, type of
       criminal activity, etc.

AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010                                                     33


             3.11.1.1.7.1.9.3. C=Conspiracy: Agreement between two or more persons
             to commit a crime.
             3.11.1.1.7.1.9.4. S=Solicit: To entice into illegal action.
             3.11.1.1.7.1.9.5. Bias Motivation Codes: The object of this collection is to
             indicate whether the offender was motivated to commit the offense because
             of bias against a racial, religious, ethnic/national origin, sexual orientation or
             disability group (Refer to bias motivation codes in Section II of the AF
             Form 3545). Because of the difficulty of ascertaining the offender’s
             subjective motivation, bias is to be reported only if investigation reveals
             sufficient objective facts to lead a reasonable and prudent person to
             conclude the offender’s actions were motivated, in whole or in part, by bias.
             While no single fact may be conclusive, facts such as the following,
             particularly when combined are supportive of a finding of bias:
                3.11.1.1.7.1.9.5.1. The offender and the victim were of different racial,
                religious, ethnic/national origin or sexual orientation groups or disability
                status.
                3.11.1.1.7.1.9.5.2. Bias-related oral comments, written statements or
                gestures were made by the offender which indicates bias.
                3.11.1.1.7.1.9.5.3. Bias-related drawings, markings, symbols or graffiti
                left at the crime scene.
                3.11.1.1.7.1.9.5.4. Certain objects, items or things that indicate bias
                were used or left behind, e.g., the offenders wore white sheets with
                hoods covering their faces.
                3.11.1.1.7.1.9.5.5. The victim is a member of a racial, religious,
                ethnic/national origin sexual orientation or disability group that is
                overwhelmingly outnumbered by members of another group in the
                neighborhood where the victim lives and the incident took place. This
                factor loses significance with the passage of time, i.e., it is most
                significant when the victim first moved into the neighborhood and
                becomes less and less significant as time passes without incident.
                3.11.1.1.7.1.9.5.6. The victim is visiting a neighborhood where previous
                hate crimes were committed against other members of his or her racial,
                religious, ethnic/national origin, sexual orientation or disability group
                and where tensions remain high against the group.
                3.11.1.1.7.1.9.5.7. Several incidents have occurred in the same locality,
                at or about the same time and the victims are all of the same racial,
                religious, ethnic / national origin, sexual orientation or disability groups.
                3.11.1.1.7.1.9.5.8. A substantial portion of the community where the
                crime occurred perceives the incident was motivated by bias.
                3.11.1.1.7.1.9.5.9. The victim was engaged in activities promoting his
                or her racial, religious, ethnic/national origin, sexual orientation or
                disability group.
 34                                     AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010


                         3.11.1.1.7.1.9.5.10. The incident coincided with a holiday relating to or
                         a date of particular significance to a racial, religious, ethnic/national
                         origin, sexual orientation or disability group.
                         3.11.1.1.7.1.9.5.11. The offender was previously involved in a similar
                         hate crime or is a member of a hate group.
                         3.11.1.1.7.1.9.5.12. There were indications a hate group was involved.
                         3.11.1.1.7.1.9.5.13. A historically established animosity exists between
                         the victim’s group and the offender’s group.
                         3.11.1.1.7.1.9.5.14. The victim, although not a member of the targeted
                         racial, religious, ethnic/national origin, sexual orientation or disability
                         group, is a member of an advocacy group supporting the precepts of the
                         victim group.
The aforementioned factors are not all-inclusive examples of biased motivation. Reporting
agencies must examine each case for facts that clearly evidence the offender’s bias motivated
him/her to commit the crime. Agencies must be alert to misleading facts, e.g., the offender used
an epithet to refer to the victim’s race, but the offender and the victim were of the same race.
Agencies must be alert to evidence left by the offenders, which is meant to give the false
impression the incident was motivated by bias. Even if the offender was mistaken in the belief
the victim was a member of a racial, religious, ethnic/national origin, sexual orientation or
disability group, the offense is still a hate crime as long as the offender was motivated by bias
against that group. For example, a middle-aged, non-gay man walking by a bar frequented by
gays was attacked by six teenagers who mistakenly believed the victim had left the bar and was
gay. Although the offenders were wrong on both counts, the offense is a hate crime because it
was motivated by the offenders’ anti-gay bias.
EXAMPLE 1: While driving through a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood, a black male
stopped his car to repair a flat tire. A group of Hispanic men leaving a bar across the street
accosted the driver and attacked him with bottles and clubs. During the attack, the offenders
called the victim by a well-known and recognized epithet used against blacks and told him
blacks were not welcome in the neighborhood. This incident would be reported as anti-black
because blacks were not welcome in the neighborhood. This incident would be reported as anti-
black because the victim and offenders are of different races, the offenders used a racial epithet
and the facts reveal no other reason for the attack than the stated one, i.e., to keep blacks out of
the neighborhood.
EXAMPLE 2: A white juvenile male snatched a Jewish woman’s purse and in doing so,
knocked her down and called her by a well-known and recognized epithet used against Jewish
people. The offender’s identity is not known. Although the offender used an epithet for Jewish
people, it is not known whether he belongs to another religious group or whether his motive was
anything more than robbery. Because the facts are ambiguous, agencies should not report this
incident as bias motivated.
EXAMPLE 3: Overnight, unknown persons broke into a synagogue and destroyed several
religious objects. The perpetrators left a large swastika drawn on the door and wrote, “Death to
Jews” on the wall. Although valuable items were present, none were stolen. Report this incident
as Anti-Jewish because the offender destroyed religious objects, left anti-Semitic words and
AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010                                                          35


graffiti behind and theft did not appear to be the motive for the burglary.
EXAMPLE 4: A 29-year-old Asian male was attacked by a 51-year-old white male wielding a
tire iron. The victim suffered severe lacerations and a broken arm. The incident took place in a
parking lot next to a bar. Investigation revealed the offender and victim had previously
exchanged racial insults in the bar, the offender having initiated the exchange by calling the
victim by a well known and recognized epithet used against the Japanese and complaining the
Japanese were taking away jobs from Americans. Anti-Asian/Pacific Islander offense would be
reported based on the difference in race of the victim and offender, the exchange of racial insults
and the absence of other reasons for attack.
EXAMPLE 5: An adult white male was approached by four white teenagers who requested
money for the bus. When he refused, one of the youths said to the others, “Let’s teach this
(epithet for a gay person) a lesson”. The victim was punched in the face, knocked to the ground,
kicked several times and robbed of his wristwatch, ring and wallet. When he reported the crime,
the victim advised he did not know the offenders and he was not gay. The facts are ambiguous.
Although an epithet for a gay person was used by one of the offenders, the victim was not gay,
such epithets are sometimes used as general insults regardless of the target person’s sexual
orientation and in this case the offenders’ motivation appeared to be limited to obtaining money
from the victim. Therefore, the incident would not be designated bias motivated.
EXAMPLE 6: A small neighborhood bar frequented by gays burned down after being closed
for the night. Investigation revealed the fire was deliberately set. The fact that the bar was
frequented by gays may have been coincidental. Therefore, the incident is not reported as bias
motivated. Two weeks later, three white adult males were arrested on a tip from an informant.
They admitted burning down the bar, saying they did it to keep gays out of the neighborhood.
As a result, this incident should now be reported as a bias crime.
EXAMPLE 7: Six black men assaulted and seriously injured a white man and his Asian male
friend as they were walking through a residential neighborhood. Witnesses said the victims were
attacked because they were trespassing in a “black” neighborhood. An Anti-Multi-Racial Group
bias incident should be reported because the victim and offenders were of different races and
witnesses reported the victims were attacked because they were not black.
EXAMPLE 8: Overnight, an auditorium, which was being used by representatives of several
religious denominations to hold an ecumenical conference, was vandalized by unknown subjects.
Extensive damage was caused and statements, such as “There is but one true religion” and
“Down with the nonbelievers,” were spray painted onto the walls. An Anti-Multi-Religious
Group incident should be reported because the offenders clearly evidenced their hostility against
a group representing more than one religion.
                   3.11.1.1.7.1.10. Location/Address: Enter the location and address of the
                   offense, i.e., Rm. 210, Bldg 100, Lackland AFB, TX 78236.
                   3.11.1.1.7.1.11. U.S. State or Possession: Enter “Yes” if the offense occurred
                   in US or its possessions.
                   3.11.1.1.7.1.12. Sector:    Enter the sector of the installation the offense
                   occurred.
                   3.11.1.1.7.1.13. On Uniformed Service Installation:        Enter “Yes” if the
36                                   AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010


                offense occurred on DoD or Coast Guard property.
                3.11.1.1.7.1.14. Location of Offense: Mark the appropriate location. (Self-
                explanatory)
                3.11.1.1.7.1.15. Type of Criminal Activity:       Mark the appropriate block
                (More than one block may be marked).
                3.11.1.1.7.1.16. Illegal Entries: This data element is used only if the offense
                is Burglary/B&E. It is for reporting whether “Force” or “No Force” was used
                by the burglar(s) to enter the structure. A forced entry is where force of any
                degree or a mechanical contrivance of any kind (including a passkey or
                skeleton key), was used to unlawfully enter a building or other structure. An
                unforced entry is one where the unlawful entry was achieved without force
                through an unlocked door or window. If both forced and unforced entries
                were involved in the crime, the entry should be reported as having been
                accomplished through “Force”.
                3.11.1.1.7.1.17. Number of Premises Entered: This data element is used only
                if the crime is Burglary/B&E and the “Hotel Rule” is applicable. In such
                cases, the number (01-99) of structures (premises) entered is to be reported.
                In the Summary Reporting System, the Hotel Rule is applied to only
                temporary lodgings. It states: If a number of dwelling units under a single
                manager are burglarized and the offenses are most likely to be reported to the
                police by the manager rather than the individual tenants, the burglary should
                be scored as one offense. The Hotel Rule may include military living quarters
                with multiple dwelling units. For example, if six BEQs are entered at the
                same time, it should be reported as one incident. The Hotel Rule has been
                expanded to include rental storage facilities, i.e., “Mini-Storage” and “Self-
                Storage” buildings. Therefore, this data element is to be used if the offense is
                Burglary/B&E and either “Hotel/Motel/ Etc”. or “Rental Storage Facility” is
                entered into Location Type. The total number (up to 99) of individual rooms,
                units, suites, storage compartments, etc., entered is to be reported in this data
                element.
                3.11.1.1.7.1.18. Page number: Enter the report’s total number of pages, i.e., 1
                of 8, 1 of 6, etc. Page numbers will depend on the number of offenders,
                victims, witnesses and narrative length.
     3.11.1.2. PAGE 2, SECTION III OFFENDER: This page documents offender
     information. There is only space for one offender. If more than one offender is involved
     in the incident, simply add a record and fill in the information.
        3.11.1.2.1. If there is more than one offender, add a record for additional offenders.
            3.11.1.2.1.1. Suspect: Mark this block if the offender is suspected of a crime (not
            enough probable cause to apprehend).
            3.11.1.2.1.2. Subject: Mark this block if the offender is the subject of a crime
            (enough probable cause to apprehend).
            3.11.1.2.1.3. Offender Identifier: Assigned a sequence number from 01 to 99 to
AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010                                                    37

                3.11.1.2.1.43.1. Alcohol: This data element indicates whether the offender
                was suspected of consuming alcohol. For example, witnesses to an assault

     documents the victim’s, witness’ or complainant’s information. The majority of this page
     is designed for the victims. If using it for a witness or complainant, do not fill in any of
     the victim blocks, just leave them blank. There is only enough space for one victim,
     witness or complainant. If there is more than one victim, witness or complainant, add a
     record.
        3.11.1.3.1. Victim/witness/complainant category:       Mark the appropriate category;

            victimized by it.
            3.11.1.3.1.3. Complainant: Defined as a third party person that didn’t witness the
            crime nor is a victim of the crime. For example, a victim of a crime asks an
            innocent bystander (complainant) to call 911. In this case, the complainant is
            merely reporting a crime they didn’t witness.
            3.11.1.3.1.4. NOTE: A person may seem to fall into two categories when they
            report a crime if they are a victim. For example, a person calls and reports their
            car was stolen from the BX parking lot. It would appear they are a victim and
            complainant since they are reporting it stolen. Always categorize this type of
            person as a victim. Remember complainants are third party personnel that are not

     3.11.1.3.19. Component: Enter Uniformed Service Component; Regular, Reserve or
     National Guard, if applicable.
     3.11.1.3.20. Victim type (VICTIM ONLY): Only one block can be marked for each
     victim. For example, during a bank robbery, the offender pointed a gun at a teller and
     demanded and received money. The robber also pistol-whipped a customer who
     stood in his way as he made his escape from the bank. There were three victims; i.e.,
     the bank, the teller and the pistol-whipped customer. Therefore, their type should be

     sections; property, Security Forces members at incident and administrative disposition.
        3.11.1.4.1. Property description: This data element describes the property that was
        burned, counterfeited, destroyed/damaged/ vandalized, recovered, seized or stolen.
        Refer to table 4 of Section V, AF Form 3545, for the allowable codes.
        3.11.1.4.2. Serial number: Self-explanatory.
        3.11.1.4.3. Secured/unsecured: Enter “S” for secured or “U” for unsecured. This
        data element specifies the level of security of the property.
        3.11.1.4.4. Loss Codes: This data element describes the type(s) of property loss,
        recovery, seizure, etc., which occurred in an incident. (Refer to table 5, section V, AF

        items listed in the property description column. Leave this column blank on:
        Drugs/narcotics, Money, Negotiable Instruments and Nonnegotiable Instruments.
        3.11.1.4.6. Ownership: This data element describes whether the government or a
        private individual owns the property. (Refer to table 6, section V, AF FM 3545 for

        3.11.1.4.7. Value of Property: Enter the total dollar value (up to $999,999,999) of
        the property which was burned (includes damage caused in fighting the fire),
        counterfeited, destroyed/damaged/ vandalized, recovered, seized, stolen, etc., as a
        result of the incident. If the value is unknown, enter one dollar ($1.00) which means
        unknown; i.e., “1” = Unknown. The following guidelines should be used to report
        the value of property:
            3.11.1.4.7.1. Use fair market value for articles subject to depreciation because
            of wear and tear, age or other factors that cause the value to decrease with use.
            3.11.1.4.7.2. Use cost to the merchant (wholesale cost) of goods recovered,
            seized and stolen, dollar etc., from retail establishments, warehouses, etc. In other
            words, use the value representing the actual cash loss to the victim without any
            markup or profit added.
            3.11.1.4.7.3. Use victim’s valuation of items such as jewelry, watches and other
            similar goods that decrease in value slightly or not at all with use or age.
            3.11.1.4.7.4. Use replacement cost or actual cash cost to victim for new or almost
            new clothes, auto accessories, bicycles, etc.
            3.11.1.4.7.5. When the victim obviously exaggerates the value of
            stolen/destroyed/damaged property for insurance or other purposes, common
            sense and good judgment will dictate a fair market value to be placed on the
            stolen items by Security Forces.
AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010                                                      43


          3.11.1.4.7.6. For government property, use fair market value for articles subject
          to depreciation. Use replacement cost for other types of property.
          3.11.1.4.7.7. In most instances, accept the victim’s valuation. The theft of
          nonnegotiable instruments such as traveler’s checks, personal checks, money
          orders, stocks, bonds, food stamps, etc., should be scored but no value recorded.
          Again, “hair-splitting” refinements are unnecessary. Negotiable instruments such
          as bonds payable to the bearer, etc., are valued at the current market price at the
          time of the theft, seizure, etc. Values should be rounded to the nearest whole
          dollar. Often the condition of the property is different at recovery than it was
          when stolen. The market value at the time of recovery should be used even
          though it is less than the value reported at the time of the theft. If the value has
          increased by the time the property is recovered, the recovery value should not
          exceed its value at the time it was stolen.
          3.11.1.4.7.8. If drugs or narcotics were seized in a drug case, no value is to be
          entered into this data element, but the estimated quantity of the drugs/narcotics is
          to be reported. Therefore, when the offense is Drug/Narcotic violations, “Seized”
          was entered into Property Loss/etc, and “Drugs/ Narcotics” was entered into
          Property Description. No value is to be entered into this data element and Drug
          Code, Drug Quantity and Type Drug Measure are to be used instead. However,
          when drugs or narcotics are involved in other types of crime (e.g., they were
          stolen through burglary, robbery, theft, etc. or destroyed by arson) their value is to
          be entered into this data element and Drug Code, Drug Quantity and Type Drug
          Measure are blank.
       3.11.1.4.8. Date recovered (YYYYMMDD): Enter the date the stolen property was
       recovered. Accordingly, this data element is used only if Recovered is entered into
       Data Element Type Property Loss/Etc. If there is more than one date of recovery for
       the same “Property Description,” enter the earliest date. If the recovery date is
       unknown, enter the date of the report.
       3.11.1.4.9. Date returned (YYYYMMDD): When previously stolen property is
       returned, the date of return is entered in this data element. Accordingly, this data
       element is used only if Recovered or Seized is entered into Data Element Property
       Loss/Etc.
       3.11.1.4.10. Drug code: This data element is used to identify the types of drugs or
       narcotics seized in a drug case. Refer to table 7, Section V, AF FM 3545 for drug
       codes.
       3.11.1.4.11. Estimated drug quantity: This data element indicates the quantity (up to
       999,999,999) of drugs or narcotics seized in a drug case. This data element is not
       used when drugs or narcotics were burned, stolen, etc., in connection with other
       offenses, such as Arson, Burglary/B&E, Larceny/Theft, etc.
       3.11.1.4.12. Type drug measurement: This data element indicates the type of
       measurement used in quantifying drugs or narcotics seized in a drug case. This data
       element is not used when drugs or narcotics were stolen, burned, etc. (Refer to table
       8, section V, AF Form 3545 for drug measurement codes).

            3.11.1.4.15.1. Referred to: Self-explanatory
            3.11.1.4.15.2. Number of victims notified (SFAR/S5R USE ONLY):                 Self-
            explanatory
            3.11.1.4.15.3. Number of witnesses notified (SFAR/S5R USE ONLY): Self-
            explanatory
            3.11.1.4.15.4. Distribution: Self-explanatory
            3.11.1.4.15.5. Incident clearance reason (SFAR/S5R USE ONLY). This data
            element indicates why the incident was cleared. If the incident is not cleared by
            “Unfounded “or” Arrest”, then the incident is considered to be exceptionally
            cleared. In a multiple-offense incident, the exceptional clearance of one offense
            clears the entire incident. An incident cannot be cleared exceptionally if it was
            previously or at the same time cleared by an arrest; i.e., if an offender segment
            was or is being submitted. In order to clear an offense by exceptional means, the
            following four conditions must be met: (1) the investigation must have clearly and
            definitely established the identity of at least one offender; (2) sufficient probable
            cause must have been developed to support the arrest, charging and prosecution of
            the offender; (3) the exact location of the offender must be known so an arrest
            could be made; and (4) there must be a reason outside the control of Air Provost
            which prevents the arrest. If blank, this data element will be recorded as “Not
            Applicable”.
            3.11.1.4.15.6. Exceptional clearance date YYYYMMDD (SFAR/S5R USE
            ONLY): If an incident was cleared by exceptional means, enter the date when the
            incident was cleared. If Incident Clearance Reason contains the values A-E, this
            field is required. The clearance date cannot be earlier than the incident date.
            3.11.1.4.15.7. Page number: Enter the appropriate page number.
     3.11.1.5. PAGE 5, SECTION VIII COMMANDER’S ACTION SEGMENT (FOR
     SFAR/S5R AND COMMANDER’S USE ONLY). This page is for the offender’s
     commander. If there is more than one offender, add additional records to this page with
     the offender and victim pages. The commander documents the action taken against the
     offender and forwards to the Reports and Analysis Section.
     3.11.1.6. PAGE 6, NARRATIVE: This page is used to document the narrative and any
     other portions of the form needed. Document the details of the incident; who, what,
     when, where and how. Include attitude at time of apprehension and give details if
     uncooperative. Additionally, use the narrative section to continue any section on the
     form and to further explain the incident. Use of other products in lieu of the narrative
     page is authorized. At the end of the narrative, four lines down, put in the Security
AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010                                                        45

       blank.
3.12. AF Form 3907, Security Forces Field Interview Data. This form is used to record
routine contact between Security Forces members and members of the public in accordance with

walking around the housing area in the middle of the night, this form would be used to record the
contact made with the individual. The form is filled out in one copy and is forwarded to the
Security Forces Investigations Section. The Investigations Section can then compare this form
with reported crimes in the area to develop possible leads or suspects. The form is self-
explanatory. (Attachment 19)
3.13. DD Form 460, Provisional Pass. This form is issued by a Security Forces member to an

       individual to whom the pass is issued must sign the form at the bottom of the reverse
       side, acknowledging the order to report to their commander as soon as possible.
3.14. DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket: This form is issued to an individual who
has committed a moving or non-moving traffic offense. It is prepared in three copies. The
original (white) copy (Attachment 21) is submitted through channels to the violator’s

   3.14.33. Vehicle Defects: Self-explanatory
   3.14.34. The third copy (pink) is given to the violator or affixed to the vehicle if the vehicle
   is unattended. Complete the back of the pink copy before giving it to the violator. This gives
   the violator written reporting instructions. This must be done even if the violator has been
   given verbal instructions. Normally, the back of the pink copy is completed before the back
   of the yellow copy. This prevents the violator from being detained for an unnecessary
   amount of time. Use the following to help with filling out the back of the pink copy:
   (Attachment 23)
      3.14.34.1. Place an “X” in all three of the boxes.
      3.14.34.2. In the second block, write in the telephone number for the Security Forces
      control center in the space provided.
      3.14.34.3. Write under special instructions: patrolmen will write/stamp/place label on
      the back of the pink copy given to the violator the following: “If you wish to rebut this
      citation report to Security Forces Administration and Reports Branch (SFAR/S5R), Bldg
      #XXX, within 5 duty days. If you do not notify SFAR/S5R of your rebuttal request, it
      will be assumed you do not which to rebut the citation”.
      3.14.34.4. If issuing a citation for a “fix-it-ticket”, each violation must be written on a
      separate DD Form 1408.
   3.14.35. File the second (yellow) copy and give the third (pink) copy to the violator or place
   it on the windshield of the unattended vehicle. If there is inclement weather it may be a good
   idea to place the ticket in a plastic baggie.
   3.14.36. The reverse side of the DD Form 1408 is used for transmittal of traffic violations
   through military channels. Ensure the violation indicated on the DD Form 1408 is in
   accordance with AFI 31-204, Air Force Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision, and all required
   information is carefully entered on the form. (Attachment 24)
   3.14.37. Ensure the required information is annotated. If the ticket has administrative errors,
   it will be returned to SFO/S3 for correction. If the ticket needs to be voided, the issuing
   Security Forces member or DFC may do so. No other person has the authority to void a
   ticket.

                                           Chapter 4

                    INSTALLATION ENTRY CONTROLLER DUTIES

4.1. Installation Entry Controller (IEC). As the first point of contact for the public, IECs are
Air Force ambassadors. Visitors to a base often judge the entire installation by IEC appearance
and performance. Normally assigned to the host Security Forces squadron, the IEC is the
installation’s first line of defense against unwanted or illegal entry; ensuring only authorized
personnel are granted access. Proper management of this program requires recognition of the
importance of the IEC.
   4.1.1. Key Qualifications: IECs serve an important role and function. It is critical for the
   IEC to look and act professional while at the same time remaining vigilant to breaches of
   security and other violations of the law. Personnel performing duties as IECs must know and
   display confidence in the enforcement of installation entry control procedures, detection of
   impaired drivers and suppressing theft and pilferage of government property through
   execution of random vehicle inspections. The IEC must reflect exemplary military bearing
   and appearance, professionalism and positive attitude toward the public that exemplify the
   Air Force operating style and tradition.
   4.1.2. To perform their duties properly, IECs must demonstrate a professional and courteous
   demeanor, which reflects Air Force strength and dignity. All communications with the
   public will be characterized by addressing every person as “sir or ma’am,” without
   exception. Slang or “street language” will not be used. Military IECs must give sharp
   military salutes to officers and clear hand signals when directing traffic; civilian police/guard
   IECs will execute clear hand signals when directing traffic. Additionally, they will not eat,
   loiter, smoke, or chew gum or tobacco in the view of the public.
   4.1.3. IECs should ensure they conduct post changeover IAW local procedures. IECs will
   position themselves to maximize their visibility to incoming traffic and to enhance their
   ability to efficiently perform their duties. Whether monitoring single or double lanes of
   traffic, the IEC will stand facing on-coming traffic in a position near the gate house where
   they can be best observed by the driver. While every building configuration differs, the IEC
   will stand in a position slightly in front of and away from the gate building, so as to make
   themselves the most visible to incoming drivers. IECs should not stray too far away from the
   building, as it may become necessary to take cover using the facility or installed vehicle
   barriers. Once a military IEC has identified a person as an officer, assume the position of
   attention, salute and then return to a position of advantage to continue monitoring traffic.
       4.1.3.1. As a vehicle approaches the gate, the IEC will stand at a position to give them an
       advantage, while maintaining visible to incoming traffic. The IEC will signal the vehicle
       driver to stop and he/she will approach the vehicle and request to view the driver’s
       identification. Once the vehicle is stopped, the IEC will ask for entry credentials by
       saying, “Sir/Ma’am, may I see your I.D. card?” The IEC will physically handle the
       identification card while in the “interviewing stance”. The IEC will compare the picture
       on the credential, e.g. DD Form 2, Geneva Convention Identification Card, DD Form
       1173, Uniform Services Identification and Privilege Card, AF Form 354, Civilian
       Identification Card, etc., to the individual and check the card for the required hologram
AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010                                                        53


     symbols. The IEC will then check the expiration date and look at the back of the card to
     ensure the credential is valid. Once the identification has been verified allow the driver
     to proceed onto the installation. This is done by saying, “thank you sir/ma’am, you may
     proceed” or something similar to let the individual know it is ok to proceed. If a vehicle
     driver has no entry credentials, the IEC will address the driver in a friendly, courteous
     manner and inquire their business on the installation. If the individual needs directions,
     information or a vehicle pass, direct them to the visitor center, if one is available. During
     100% I.D. checks, the IEC will check the identification of all personnel in the vehicle
     when applicable. NOTE: Installations and MAJCOMS may implement stricter 100% I.D
     check (e.g. biometrics or 2nd form of identification) criteria as necessary based on RAMs,
     increased FPCONs, etc.
     4.1.3.2. When monitoring two lanes of traffic, IECs will position themselves in the
     center of traffic if a raised platform/protective barrier exists. IECs may stand in the
     centerline between traffic lanes if the DFC feels it is safe to do so. The IEC will stand
     facing traffic, at a position to give them an advantage, yet visible to incoming traffic. If
     no permanent structure exists for IECs to use, e.g. concrete, elevated stands, the IEC will
     wear a reflective vest and place a traffic cone in front of them to help drivers recognize
     them.
  4.1.4. Selection and Training. The foundation for a successful IEC program is solid training.
  IECs should be highly motivated, articulate individuals who display a professional image.
  Initial training should emphasize the ability to communicate with the public and
  professionalism. Establish a training and knowledge enrichment program built on training
  normally received by Security Forces personnel performing IEC duties. This training should
  include, but is not limited to, courtesies, human relations, dealing with the public, dress and
  appearance and a comprehensive knowledge of the installation layout.
  4.1.5. IEC Uniforms. The wear of the military uniform reflects the individual’s pride and
  attitude towards the Air Force, the unit and themselves. The standard uniform for military
  entry controllers will be the Airman Battle Uniform (ABU) or BDU. If wearing BDUs they
  will be pressed and black boots will be highly shined. When blues are worn, weather should
  be taken into consideration when deciding which combination will be used. Highly polished
  black low quarter shoes or boots are authorized. The primary duty uniform for civilian
  police/guard IECs is the dark navy blue uniform shirt with shoulder patches, metal badge and
  metal nameplate, navy blue uniform trousers, polished black footwear, navy ball cap, and
  black duty gear. Additionally, MAJCOM and installation supplements may specify which
  uniform will be worn based on the climatic conditions of their installations. The proper wear
  of these uniforms projects a professional military image and provides for that “all important”
  first impression. Regardless of how many installation entry control points are manned, all
  IECs should wear the same uniform unless the entry control point is open less than six hours
  per day. If an installation gate is open six hours or less per day, the IEC may wear the same
  uniform worn by personnel on other Air Provost posts.
  4.1.6. Antiterrorism. The threats by terrorists are often predicated on surveillance and
  preparations by potential terrorist groups. IECs should be vigilant and be on the lookout for
  tests of security and surveillance by terrorist entities.
 54                                    AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010


       4.1.6.1. If an IEC sees any anomaly, (Refer to 2.4.1) they should obtain as much
       descriptive data as possible. This includes license plate numbers, vehicle description and
       unusual markings or stickers. The IEC should also look for description of the individual
       noting things that are difficult to alter, such as height, eye shape and scars and
       distinguishing marks.
       4.1.6.2. These security test(s) could include vehicle(s) pulling into a base and attempting
       to elicit information about the base, individual(s) taking photographs, and/or drawing the
       installation or parts of the installation.
4.2. Post Reporting. Security Forces members report the status of their post to the senior
person conducting post checks or visits. For post reporting procedures refer to AFMAN 31-201,
Vol 1.
4.3. Installation Entry Point Checks Defined. Per DoD 5200.8-R, Physical Security Program,
April 2007, Air Force installation commanders have responsibility for protecting personnel and
property under their jurisdiction and maintaining order on installations. A key part of that
responsibility is the requirement to prescribe procedures for inspecting persons, their property
and vehicles at entry and exit points of installations. The question of whether a vehicle
examination is an inspection or a search is a legal determination based upon evaluation of the
facts and circumstances surrounding the examination in light of statutory provisions, evidentiary
rules (e.g., Military Rules of Evidence 313-315), and controlling judicial decisions. In this
manual, we avoid use of the term “inspection,” substituting the term “installation entry point
check”. An installation entry point check is the examination of a vehicle without the foundation
for a search. Installation commanders may direct or establish procedures for installation entry
point checks of randomly selected vehicles entering or leaving an installation under their
jurisdiction whether the owner or operator is military or civilian. These random checks are not
based upon probable cause to believe the vehicle/pedestrian contains property subject to search,
but are based on the commander’s authority to protect the security of his/her installation, to
protect government property, and to prevent theft. The Security Forces at the installation entry
point are acting, not in an Air Provost capacity, but as sentinels safe-guarding a military
installation and protecting government property while preventing theft. In foreign countries,
follow the provisions of international agreements.
   4.3.1. To use results of installation entry point checks in military justice actions, it is
   essential Security Forces have no involvement in determining which vehicles to check. The
   installation commander or his/her designee as outlined in AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense,
   determines the selection of vehicles on a random basis. They may use an impersonal
   computer generated product formula, such as every other vehicle, every tenth vehicle, every
   fifth passenger car and every van and truck. The number and frequency of the vehicles
   checked does not affect their randomness. Thus, a check is random even if it includes every
   vehicle that enters or leaves the installation during a selected period. Do not use random
   checks as a ploy to check the vehicle of a particular suspect. Such action is illegal and may
   subject the involved Security Forces members to criminal penalties. It is recommended a
   computerized generated product be used to randomly select times and places for installation
   entry checks.
   4.3.2. The rule against Security Forces selecting vehicles to check does not preclude
   authorizing installation entry controllers to discontinue checking when circumstance warrant
AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010                                                         55


  (e.g., there is a serious traffic jam, an accident or other circumstances which make continued
  checking unsafe or impractical). However, once discontinued, the checks should not be
  restarted. Indicate in the blotter the reason for stopping the checks. Annotate in the blotter
  the reason checks were not conducted. The cancellation of vehicle checks will be authorized
  by the flight commander or Flight Sergeant.
     4.3.2.1. Other circumstances to discontinue a check may be when an AFOSI agent
     advises that the government or civilian vehicle selected for an inspection is in the middle
     of an operation. (Ref para 4.3.3.6.).
  4.3.3. Procedures for Installation Entry Point Vehicle Checks. Normally, at least two
  Security Forces members are present to conduct entry point checks. Before starting an entry
  point check, if the vehicle operator consents, instruct the driver to proceed to a predesignated
  location out of inbound/outbound traffic lanes, turn off engine and direct all other occupants
  to exit the vehicle. When the passengers have exited, ask the driver to open the center
  console, glove compartment, hood and open the trunk and any other locked compartments. If
  permission is refused, advise the person in control of the vehicle that refusal to permit the
  examination may result in the loss of base driving privileges, debarment from the base or
  other actions. If permission is still refused, take action, as appropriate, outlined in 4.3.3.1.
  and 4.3.3.2. Additionally, request a valid driver’s license, state vehicle registration and proof
  of vehicle insurance from the vehicle operator. Members searching a vehicle should take all
  appropriate cautions to ensure they do not damage the vehicle during the search.
     4.3.3.1. Vehicles Entering the Base. If under civilian control, ask the driver or owner for
     identification and advise all occupants they cannot enter the base unless the vehicle is
     examined. Handle vehicles under the control of a military member in the same manner
     or, subject to applicable policies, the vehicle may be examined using reasonable force, if
     necessary. Make a walk-around examination of the vehicle. The Security Forces
     member may discover evidence to use as a foundation for a search. The SJA should be
     consulted if in doubt as to the extent of force authorized.
     4.3.3.2. Vehicles Leaving the Base. Document driver and vehicle identification for
     subsequent action. Make a walk-around examination of the vehicle. The Security Forces
     member may discover evidence to use as a foundation for a search (e.g., contraband or
     government property in plain view). If there is no probable cause for a search, but action
     is deemed necessary to protect operations, property or ensure safety; then order the
     occupants to dismount and open locked compartments of the vehicle. Advise them this
     order is based upon the authority of the installation commander. If this order is not
     complied with, take immediate steps to report the matter to the installation commander or
     to a senior officer delegated this authority. The commander or his/her designee will
     determine what option to use to open and examine the vehicle and its compartments.
     4.3.3.3. If contraband is discovered during the course of examining a vehicle at an entry
     point check, immediately stop the search and apprehend/detain the person involved.
     When civilians are detained, summon civilian police immediately, if applicable.
     Additionally, if any items of contraband, such as unregistered weapons or explosives are
     found, Explosive Ordiance Disposal (EOD) and AFOSI should be contacted and briefed.
56                                    AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010


     4.3.3.4. Entry point checks of persons and vehicles entering/exiting a military installation
     are allowed without permission in accordance with random procedures identified in
     paragraph 4.3.3.
     4.3.3.5. The long-range deterrent value of entry point checks, as well as Security Forces
     community relations, dictates a general rule to apply the same policy to both military and
     civilians. Use of force to examine vehicles under either military or civilian control
     requires discretion in each instance to determine whether this action is warranted by the
     circumstances.
     4.3.3.6. AFOSI agents often utilize civilian clothes and civilian vehicles while working.
     Their job can also entail development of human sources/informants. Situations may
     require AFOSI agents to bring these individuals on base without going through the
     normal entry procedures. While on official business AFOSI Badge and Credentials will
     be acceptable identification and acceptable for entry onto an installation and into a
     controlled area if necessary. Those individuals sponsored by the AFOSI agent will be
     permitted onto the base without having to provide identification. If an SF member
     believes an AFOSI agent is abusing this privilege, he will report this to his Flight
     Sergeant and this will be addressed between the AFOSI and Security Forces senior
     leadership. The AFOSI agent is not to be impeded or detained while the matter is
     resolved, but is to be authorized onto the installation or into the controlled area without
     delay.
  4.3.4. Installation Entry Point Checks of Pedestrians. The policies and procedures covering
  vehicles also apply to pedestrians entering or leaving the base. In view of the limited
  capability of pedestrians to conceal and transport property (when compared to vehicles) and
  the limited facilities for examination of persons at installation entry points, pedestrian checks
  may be excluded from entry point checks. However, if the local situation dictates, personnel
  may be subjected to these examinations. Unless probable cause exists for a search, limit
  checks to examination of hand-carried parcels and exterior garments removed from the
  individual. Always remember safety when conducting entry point checks.
  4.3.5. Military Working Dog Teams. Whenever possible, use military working dog teams to
  enhance installation entry point checks.
AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010                                                        57


                                           Chapter 5

                            INSTALLATION PATROL DUTIES

5.1. Patrol Purpose. Security Forces patrol provides protection for Air Force personnel and
resources. The primary duties of a Security Forces patrol include: protecting personnel and
property, preventing pilferage, supervising road traffic, enforcing traffic laws and regulations,
maintaining good order, furnishing information and directions, community policing, performing
escorts and building checks. Although these duties occur day-to-day and may appear routine,
they must not be accomplished in a haphazard manner. Personnel performing patrol duties must
be constantly alert, as there will normally be little or no warning when an emergency occurs.
   5.1.1. All Air Force installations have a different number of patrols assigned depending upon
   the size of the installation; however, each base will have at least one 24-hour patrol. The
   patrols will be linked with each other and the BDOC/ECC by an intra-base radio
   communications network. If more than one patrol exists on a base, the area of responsibility
   will be clearly defined and adhered to so as to ensure adequate coverage of the base without
   redundancy.
   5.1.2. Response time limits for patrols vary according to the type of patrol and resources
   being protected.
5.2. Patrol Safety. Security Forces members have the greatest amount of contact with the
public in an uncontrolled environment while on patrol. Security Forces members have been
victimized by disregard for their own safety in this environment. Air Force installations have
less violence per capita than society at large. This circumstance can create careless duty
behaviors that demonstrate lax attitudes such as, “It can’t happen here,” or “It can’t happen to
me”. Sadly, both of these perspectives are wrong. Fatal incidents involving Security Forces
validate the testament that, in reality, Air Force installations are mere microcosms of an
increasingly violent society. Security Forces Air Provost duties place Security Forces members
on the front line against violence. BDOC/ECC controllers should evaluate responses and
dispatch back-up patrols as needed. For Security Forces, safety is as paramount as it is for our
civilian counterparts. There is often little warning before an emergency, crisis or attack occurs.
Always remain alert for the unexpected.
5.3. Types of Patrols. The use of a specific type of patrol(s) is tailored to the needs of the
installation. Some situations may call for the use of bicycle or walking patrols while others may
require motorized patrols. Security Forces members may perform any or all of the following
types of patrols:
   5.3.1. Motorized. This method provides mobility and improves the capability to cover a
   large area of the installation while carrying equipment and personnel. Effective motorized
   patrols vary their routes. Do not set a pattern or establish a routine!
   5.3.2. Foot and Bicycle. Assign these patrols to smaller areas on the installation or those
   areas with a higher concentration of resources, population and/or criminal activity. Portable
   radios link these patrols to the control center and other patrols. MWD teams may supplement
   foot patrols. Refer to AFI 31-202, Military Working Dog Program and AFMAN 31-219,
   Military Working Dog (MWD) Program, for details on how to best employ military working
   dog teams.
58                                   AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010


  5.3.3. Reserve. Provide a reserve response capability for emergencies. They may include
  the flight leader, the Flight Sergeant, security back-up force or staff personnel.
  5.3.4. Special Purpose. These patrols usually combine motorized, foot and bike patrols.
  Special purpose patrols support unique events (e.g., distinguished visitor conferences, base
  open house, air shows or unique mission aircraft landings). Other types of patrols that meet
  special purposes include horse and boat patrols.
  5.3.4. (AETC) Special purpose patrols addressed in this supplement include boat patrol
  (Attachment 34 [Added]), bicycle patrol (Attachment 35 [Added]), ATV patrol (Attachment
  36 [Added]), PWC patrol (Attachment 37 [Added]), PT patrol (Attachment 38 [Added]) and
  motorcycle patrol (Attachment 39 [Added]).
     5.3.4.1. (Added-AETC) General Information:
         5.3.4.1.1. (Added-AETC) The Defense Force Commander (DFC) must approve the
         use of a special purpose patrol.
         5.3.4.1.2. (Added-AETC) The installation environmental planning representative
         will advise the installation commander and security forces (SF) of potential
         environmental issues related to implementing a special purpose patrol program.
         5.3.4.1.3. (Added-AETC) Special purpose patrol manning will come from existing
         work force. Do not request or program additional manpower authorizations for this
         function.
         5.3.4.1.4. (Added-AETC) Special purpose patrol program and related operation and
         maintenance (O&M) equipment funding will come from installation O&M funds.
         Equipment selection will be locally determined, based on operating environmental
         and safety considerations.
         5.3.4.1.5. (Added-AETC) The DFC will develop a concept of operations
         (CONOPS) which will address how special purpose patrols will be deployed during
         increased force protection conditions (FPCON). Incorporate the CONOPS into the
         integrated defense plan (IDP).
         5.3.4.1.6. (Added-AETC) Installations will establish an AF IMT 797, Job
         Qualification Standard Continuation/ Command JQS, for special purpose patrol
         training, and document all training received. See prescribing directive AFI 36-2201,
         Volume 3, Air Force Training Program on the Job Training Administration, for
         instruction on completing the form.
     5.3.4.2. (Added-AETC) Safety. Establish special purpose patrol safety procedures.
     Ensure the installation safety office reviews and approves the procedures.
         5.3.4.2.1. (Added-AETC) The senior patrol member will incorporate Operational
         Risk Management (ORM) into daily operations, including ground safety operations.
         5.3.4.2.2. (Added-AETC) Patrol members must wear personal protective equipment
         while on patrol.
         5.3.4.2.3. (Added-AETC) In situations that are not covered by existing directives,
         use ORM to assess associated risks and determine adequate safeguards or procedures
         to manage the risk. Refer to AFPAM 90-902, Operational Risk Management (ORM)
AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010                                                        59


           Guidelines and Tools, for ORM process guidance. Note: ORM may not be used to
           violate directives or other regulatory guidance. Normal waiver or variance procedures
           must be followed. See AFI 91-301, Air Force Occupational and Environmental
           Safety, Fire Protection, and Health [AFOSH] Standards.
       5.3.4.3. (Added-AETC) Maintenance. Installations will develop and fund a care,
       inspection, and maintenance plan to ensure special patrol asset safety and serviceability.
       At a minimum, plans will meet all manufacturers’ recommendations. Technical skills
       required to maintain some special purpose patrol assets are not common to Air Force
       installations, so a local maintenance contract is highly encouraged.
       5.3.4.4. (Added-AETC) Publicity. Solicit Public Affairs (PA) support and use all
       available communication outlets to publicize the program and its positive impact on
       installation security.
5.4. Traffic Patrol. The main purpose of traffic enforcement is to reduce traffic
accidents/congestion. The goal is to enforce the base traffic code sufficiently to ensure the safe
movement of traffic. Use selective enforcement to target areas with a high incidence of traffic
code violations. As the focal point for data collection, the Reports and Analysis Section can help
pinpoint problematic traffic areas. Consider accident and congestion analysis to determine
selective patrolling and enforcement efforts. Guardmount briefings should include selective
enforcement information to include priorities of offenses, times and places. Remember, selective
enforcement does not call for issuing a ticket for each infraction. While the process of selective
enforcement does call for the Security Forces member to correct traffic problems, keep in mind
the patrol person has the discretion to issue verbal or written warnings to correct violations.
5.5. Traffic Services.
   5.5.1. Purpose.    The main purpose of traffic Air Provost is to reduce traffic
   accidents/congestion.
       5.5.1.1. The base traffic code should be enforced at a level sufficient to ensure the safe
       and expeditious movement of traffic. Traffic enforcement should be uniform, consistent
       and based on principles of selective enforcement.
       5.5.1.2. Efforts should be directed toward specific violations.
           5.5.1.2.1. In specific locations.
           5.5.1.2.2. Based primarily on traffic accident/congestion experience.
           5.5.1.2.3. Instituting programs to educate the public regarding traffic regulations
           aimed at identifying specific problems. Publish traffic accident statistics and give
           adequate notice prior to implementing changes in laws or procedures.
   5.5.2. Selective Enforcement. Selective enforcement is used throughout the Security Forces
   career field. Traffic patrolling should be centered on a selective basis taking accident and
   congestion experience into consideration. A desired enforcement quality and deterrent effect
   (which is needed) is gained through proper use of selective enforcement and discretionary
   issuance of violation notices and warnings pursuant to governing directives. Considerations
   for selective enforcement can be as follows:
 60                                    AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010


   5.5.3. Traffic Violations. Violations will be recorded on DD Form 1408, Armed Forces
   Traffic Ticket or CVB Form 1805, Violation Notice, United States District Court, and AF
   Form 3545A, Incident Report, depending upon local jurisdiction and local operating
   procedures.
   5.5.4. Assist Traffic Engineers. Security Forces, when involved in traffic operations, assist
   traffic engineers by reporting hazardous traffic conditions to the BDOC/ECC controller.
   Traffic patrols are in the best position to report:
       5.5.4.1. Defects in the roadway (holes, ruts, or dangerous shoulders).
       5.5.4.2. Lack of proper, damaged, terminated, destroyed or visually obstructed traffic
       control signs or devices.
       5.5.4.3. Lack of properly located or malfunctioning mechanical traffic control devices
       and lighting systems.
       5.5.4.4. Natural or man-caused obstructions (fallen trees and rocks, litter, shrubbery,
       stalled vehicles and electrical wires).
       5.5.4.5. A street that needs a new lane pavement stripe to allow smooth traffic flow and
       prevent accidents.
5.6. Assistance to Motorists.
   5.6.1. Motorist Services. Because of the overall danger to the stranded motorist, Security
   Forces are expected to offer reasonable help at all times to a motorist who appears to be in
   need of aid (when in doubt, stop and offer). This should apply at all hours of the day, but
   particularly during the hours of darkness when hazards are the greatest. Security Forces
   members may be asked to:
       5.6.1.1. Get emergency fuel.
       5.6.1.2. Get roadside service for a breakdown.
       5.6.1.3. Give information and directions.
       5.6.1.4. Give first aid and/or medical assistance.
       5.6.1.5. Report hazardous conditions.
       5.6.1.6. Provide an escort. Provide an escort. Emergency vehicles, particularly
       ambulances, should not be escorted except when the driver of the emergency vehicle is
       not familiar with his/her destination or when proceeding from off base.
   5.6.2. Disabled Vehicle Assistance. To prevent the appearance of preferential treatment to
   commercial organizations, the motorist should choose the organization to provide wrecker or
   roadside service or ambulance service. Explain to the motorist all fees associated with the
   assistance is at their own cost. Do not use the patrol vehicle to push or pull or “jump start”
   any vehicle for the purpose of getting it started. Security Forces members may (using
   discretion) transport stranded motorists to the nearest on-base location where assistance can
   be obtained. Ensure starting/ending mileage and time is called into the control center when
   initiating any transport.
AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010                                                          61


5.7. Use of Emergency Equipment. Use emergency equipment only when directed by a
supervisor or the BDOC/ECC, by the nature of the dispatched assignment or when appropriate
(based on the situation). Remember, the use of emergency equipment is not justification for
unsafe driving and does not automatically give you the right-of-way.
   5.7.1. Emergency (Red/Blue) Lights.
       5.7.1.1. This equipment is used to signal motorists and pedestrians that emergency
       conditions exist and the right-of-way should be relinquished to the patrol vehicle. The
       light is used to signal violators to drive to the extreme right of the roadway and stop. If
       both the Security Forces and violator’s vehicles are parked off the roadway and the patrol
       person and/or violator can stand or walk between the traffic side of their vehicles and the
       roadway, any emergency signal which exhibits light to the rear of the patrol vehicle shall
       be extinguished in order to reduce the accident potential created by its distracting effect
       on approaching drivers and to minimize attracting curiosity seekers to the scene.
       5.7.1.2. Security Forces members cannot safely assume the light will be sufficient to
       assure the right-of-way, even though in most jurisdictions, laws exist giving the right-of-
       way to emergency vehicles when emergency conditions exist. Emergency lights may be
       used in the following circumstances:
          5.7.1.2.1. When stopping traffic violators, although sometimes it may be necessary to
          use the lights and the sirens to stop a violator.
          5.7.1.2.2. When assisting motorists parked/stopped in hazardous locations.
          5.7.1.2.3. When the patrol vehicle is parked/stopped on the roadway.
       5.7.1.3. Security Forces members are responsible for any injuries or damage sustained as
       a result of Security Forces members driving behavior, which reflects a disregard for the
       safety of others.
       5.7.1.4. Use your discretion as approved by local policies.
   5.7.2. Sirens.
       5.7.2.1. The sirens is usually used in conjunction with the emergency lights. Use
       extreme caution when using the sirens. The sirens may have a startling effect on other
       drivers on the road, resulting in erratic and unpredictable driving behavior. Security
       Forces members should be careful in the use of the sirens as it frequently complicates
       traffic problems. Under extreme conditions, such as pursuit at high speeds, the sirens
       should be actuated continuously.
       5.7.2.2. The sirens should also be used to signal violators to drive to the right of the road
       when other means of attracting the violator’s attention have failed.
       5.7.2.3. Security Forces members should use the sirens based on existing traffic and
       roadway conditions and the urgency of the dispatch. For instance, in traveling to the
       scene of an emergency, the sirens should be used at intersections to alert traffic, but is
       sometimes not essential in areas where access to the traffic-way is limited and other
       traffic is minimal.
   5.7.3. Emergency Lights and Sirens. Emergency lights and sirens in combination shall be
   used in the following circumstances:

     5.7.3.1. Pursuit situations.
     5.7.3.2. When responding to an emergency.
     5.7.3.3. If necessary, to request right of way and/or exceed speed limit when responding
     to a crime in progress.
     5.7.3.4. As directed by SF leadership.
  5.7.4. Spotlight. The spotlight should be used:
     5.7.4.1. To aid a patrol when hazardous conditions exist in dealing with known or
     suspected felons. For example, following a traffic stop of a known felon, the spotlight
     should be used to illuminate the interior of the violator’s car so all occupants are kept
     within view and at a distinct disadvantage when looking back toward the patrol vehicle
     and patrol person. In this situation, Security Forces members should exercise care in
     remaining behind the spotlight so he/she is not at the same disadvantage and silhouetted
     by the light.
     5.7.4.2. To illuminate the interior of a violator’s car during hours of darkness.
     5.7.4.3. To find the address of a call being dispatched to.
         5.7.4.3.1. The spotlight should not be used to signal violators to stop due to the
         possibility of temporarily blinding the violator and other drivers from the glare
         created by the spotlight.
  5.7.5. Public Address System.
     5.7.5.1. The public address system is particularly valuable when stopping a traffic
     violator. The desired actions of the violator can be directed from a safe distance,
     minimizing hazards to the Security Forces member.
     5.7.5.2. The public address system is also valuable in directing persons when unusual
     conditions exist, such as when a street is temporarily obstructed, alerting pedestrians to
     hazardous conditions or elements and communicating with other persons concerned with
     relieving the emergency conditions.
  5.7.6. Response Procedures. The patrol is usually the first authoritative official to arrive on
  the scene of an incident. There are many incidents to which a patrol may be directed to
  respond. The patrol person must be thoroughly knowledgeable in correct response
  procedures.
     5.7.6.1. General Information. In response to any incident, the patrol must ensure its safe
     arrival in order to perform the duties assigned. The patrol will then preserve the scene
     and maintain communications with the BDOC/ECC controller and other patrols, giving
     information on the status of the incident.
         5.7.6.1.1. Upon initial response to an incident, ensure the patrol vehicle is properly
         parked. Avoid parking the vehicle where it may block emergency services
         responding to the incident. Additionally, if there is a chance the fire department or an
         ambulance may be needed, do not block their entrance to the scene.
AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010                                                          63


          5.7.6.1.2. Upon arrival, ensure the safety of the scene to preclude further injury or
          accident. After arrival, the patrol will attend to the injured, if any, and preserve the
          scene for evidence.
          5.7.6.1.3. The control center and other patrols should be kept current on the status of
          the situation.
          5.7.6.1.4. Witnesses at the scene will be identified and asked to remain for
          interviews.
5.8. Rules for Pursuit Driving. When engaged in pursuit driving, the patrol person must
remember that the sooner the subject is stopped or apprehended, the less chance there is for an
accident to happen. Remember the patrol must not endanger the public as a result of driving
techniques used in pursuit. For nuclear and chemical resource recovery operations pursuit
driving is exempt from the provisions of this section.
   5.8.1. Pursuit at high speed is justified only when Security Forces members know, or have
   reasonable grounds to believe the violator has committed or attempted to commit a major
   offense. A major offense is one that involves an action or threatened attack which Security
   Forces members have reasonable cause to believe could result or has resulted in death or
   serious bodily injury; e.g., aggravated assault, armed robbery, burglary or arson of an
   occupied building.
   5.8.2. If necessary, and within local constraints, Security Forces patrols are permitted to use
   pursuit driving at moderate speeds to apprehend motor vehicle operators who have
   committed traffic violations, minor offenses or felonies not previously addressed.
   5.8.3. At no time will Security Forces use pursuit driving at speeds that will endanger the
   public or contribute to the loss of control of the vehicle.
   5.8.4. The responsibility for making the decision to pursue an offender and method used
   rests with the individual Security Forces patrol. However, if a pursuit is initiated, the on-duty
   flight commander/sergeant will monitor and may terminate the pursuit at anytime if he/she
   feels it is in the best interest of safety. If pursuit driving is determined to be necessary, the
   following factors must be considered:
       5.8.4.1. The degree of danger to the public.
       5.8.4.2. Experience and training of the pursuit vehicle’s operator.
       5.8.4.3. Weather and road conditions.
       5.8.4.4. Pursuit vehicle characteristics.
       5.8.4.5. Present and potential roadway obstacles.
       5.8.4.6. Facilities located along the pursuit route (e.g., schools, hospital, shopping
       centers, etc.).
       5.8.4.7. Dangerous or potentially dangerous intersections along the pursuit route.
   5.8.5. Pursuit driving.
       5.8.5.1. Using Emergency Lights and Sirens. When the driver of a pursuit vehicle
       increases his/her speed or drives in such a manner as to endanger the safety of others,
64                                   AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010


     patrol persons should turn on the sirens and emergency lights and continuously use both
     throughout the pursuit. The warning effect of the sirens will decrease rapidly as the
     speed of the pursuit vehicle increases.
     5.8.5.2. Radio Procedures.
        5.8.5.2.1. Information. When the pursuit begins, call the BDOC/ECC controller and
        relay the following information:
            5.8.5.2.1.1. Location, direction and speed of travel (update continuously).
            5.8.5.2.1.2. Exact reason for pursuit.
            5.8.5.2.1.3. Vehicle description to include license number and number of
            occupants.
            5.8.5.2.1.4. Traffic conditions.
            5.8.5.2.1.5. Other details that would enable other patrols in the area, as well as
            the BDOC/ECC controller, to assist.
        5.8.5.2.2. Use the radio sparingly and keep the frequency open for the BDOC/ECC
        controller and other units to assist. In the case of a two-person patrol, the passenger
        conducts the radio communications.
        5.8.5.2.3. While transmitting information to the BDOC/ECC controller or other units
        speak as normally and as coherently as possible; ensure you do not shout.
        5.8.5.2.4. When finished, be sure to place the microphone on its hook if this can be
        accomplished safely.
        5.8.5.2.5. Passengers. If carrying other personnel in the car such as prisoners,
        witnesses or suspects do not become engaged in a pursuit. Personnel involved in
        “ride-along” programs must be dropped off at a safe location prior to becoming
        involved in a pursuit.
     5.8.5.3. Assistance.
        5.8.5.3.1. Patrols responding to assist in the pursuit should concentrate on covering
        the streets parallel to the one the pursuit is on, thus creating a “boxing in” effect that
        may discourage the violator from continuing his/her flight.
        5.8.5.3.2. This technique is also advantageous in the event the violator is able to get
        away from the immediate pursuit vehicle or in case the violator abandons his/her
        vehicle to flee on foot. If the violator should abandon his/her vehicle and flee on
        foot:
            5.8.5.3.2.1. Remove the patrol vehicle ignition keys.
            5.8.5.3.2.2. Quickly check the violator’s vehicle for occupants who may have
            hidden in it.
            5.8.5.3.2.3. To the fullest extent possible, give location, a description of the car
            and its occupants, as well as the suspect(s) direction of travel to the BDOC/ECC
            controller.
AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010                                                      65


     5.8.5.4. Maintaining a Safe Distance. During pursuit, a safe distance (five to seven car
     lengths) should be kept between both cars, enabling you to duplicate any sudden turns
     and lessen the possibility of a collision in the event of a sudden stop.
     5.8.5.5. Safety Belts. The use of safety belts in the patrol vehicle is mandatory.
     Likewise, clipboards, flashlight and other loose objects lying in the car can become
     projectiles during a sudden stop so keep them safely secured.
     5.8.5.6. Potentially Dangerous Situations.
        5.8.5.6.1. Because of the potential dangers involved, Security Forces personnel
        should not pull alongside a fleeing motorist in an attempt to force the subject into a
        ditch, curb, parked car or other obstacle.
        5.8.5.6.2. Never pass a violator while in pursuit. The danger of an accident is
        increased and the opportunity for escape becomes greater through quick application
        of the brakes and a sudden turn by the violator.
        5.8.5.6.3. To avoid being apprehended, many motorists take dangerous chances.
        Regardless of the extenuating circumstances, you should not duplicate any hazardous
        maneuvers.
        5.8.5.6.4. In the apprehension of traffic offenders and other violators, a patrol must
        be sensitive to safety. This means you must operate the vehicle in a manner that
        shows consideration for:
            5.8.5.6.4.1. The patrol person’s safety.
            5.8.5.6.4.2. The safety of the violator whom you seek to apprehend.
            5.8.5.6.4.3. Above all, ensure the safety of others who may be using the roadway.
        5.8.5.6.5. Security Forces personnel must recognize and accept the fact that one will
        not be able to successfully apprehend every perpetrator who flees from them.
     5.8.5.7. Use of Firearms. Refer to AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force
     Personnel and local policy.
     5.8.5.8. Use of Roadblocks. Because of the extreme and obvious dangers inherent in the
     use of roadblocks in pursuit situations, it is the policy of the Air Force that setting up
     roadblocks for the purpose of apprehending wanted suspects must not be used when it is
     apparent that innocent persons would be endangered.
     5.8.5.9. Terminating a Pursuit.
        5.8.5.9.1. Security Forces personnel must use their best judgment in evaluating the
        chase and continuously appraise it in deciding whether to continue the pursuit. Never
        let a personal challenge enter into the decision. The patrol should be aware the
        decision to abandon pursuit may be the most intelligent and most professional course
        of action. Stop any chase when the hazards of exposing the Security Forces member
        or the public to unnecessary dangers are high, or the environmental conditions show
        the futility of continued pursuit.
        5.8.5.9.2. It is difficult to describe exactly how a fleeing motorist could or should be
        apprehended, except it must be done legally and safely. It is also difficult to list any
 66                                     AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010


           particular traffic regulations personnel could or should not disregard. Likewise, one
           cannot set a safe, maximum pursuit speed or designate the limit of the number of
           patrol vehicles involved. Security Forces members must use their own judgment,
           their training, overall experience and guidelines in this publication and apply them
           collectively to the existing circumstances.
5.9. High Risk Stops. Anytime you see, follow, stop, or approach a dangerous felon, use the
following guidelines to ensure your safety and that of the public. There are four important things
to remember 1) Never approach an occupied vehicle, wait for a back-up regardless of how long
it takes, use teamwork, and maintain control at all times. 2) Select a good stopping site. 3) Look
for a level area large enough to hold three to four cars and one that is as open as possible. 4) A
well-illuminated area is best at night. Unlock the patrol vehicle passenger side door.
   5.9.1. Some positions for the primary and back-up patrol vehicles are:
       5.9.1.1. The oblique position where the patrol vehicle parks at a 45 degree angle
       perpendicular to the curb line. Center the right front bumper of the patrol car on, and
       approximately 2 car lengths to the rear, of the suspect vehicle. This positioning counters
       suspects who attempt to deploy air bags by backing into and compressing patrol car
       bumpers. It is imperative that the patrol car wheels are turned to the left in the event the
       patrol car is rammed, which will keep the vehicle from striking the patrol exiting on the
       driver’s side. Should you choose an alternative (passenger-side) approach, turn the patrol
       car wheels to the right and exercise extreme caution when advancing on 31 the violator’s
       vehicle. Use this positioning only during daylight hours or in well-illuminated areas.
       During low/no-light periods, the patrol vehicle headlights may impair the vision of
       drivers in oncoming lanes of traffic. Likewise, this position fails to maximize the
       illumination effects of the patrol car lights on the violator’s vehicle. At times of low light,
       request and await a backup while maintaining an increased vigilance and distance
       between vehicles.

Figure 5.1. Oblique Traffic Stop Position.
AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010                                                            67


NOTE: Single file where the back-up vehicle parks directly behind the primary vehicle (front
wheels turned to the left). Use this technique when there is little or no room to pull off the road.

Figure 5.2. Double Abreast Traffic Stop.




NOTE: Double abreast in which the back-up vehicle parks parallel and to the right or left of the
primary vehicle leave about 10 feet between vehicles and turn front wheels to the left). Use this
technique when there is a large pull-off area (e.g., expanded road shoulder, vacant parking lots).

Figure 5.3. Single File Traffic Stop.




NOTE: Primary vehicle parks directly behind the violator (front wheels turned to the left). The
back-up vehicle parks offset left providing security police the safety zone from approaching
traffic.

Figure 5.4. Backup Offset Traffic Stop.




NOTE: Position the primary and back-up vehicles behind the suspect vehicle at a distance of 30
to 40 feet. Use this technique when there is a large pull-off area and there is suspicion of
increased threat from the violator (e.g., felony stop, driver/passenger making sudden
movements).

Figure 5.5. Double Abreast (Increased Distance) Traffic Stop.




   5.9.2. Primary Vehicle Driver. The primary patrol vehicle driver often has the best
   observation point and should therefore give the verbal commands using a public address
   system. Speak slowly and clearly. The backup unit serves as the apprehending and search
AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010                                                       69


  patrol. The backup vehicle driver takes up a position on the front passenger side of the
  primary patrol vehicle. The passenger door may afford some protection. Other back-up
  personnel may assist or direct traffic away from the scene. Follow these steps:
     5.9.2.1. Command the driver and all occupants to place their hands on the headliner of
     the interior roof and leave them there until told to do otherwise. Caution all occupants not
     to make any suspicious or sudden movements. Explain to the occupants in the suspect
     vehicle that you will give them a series of commands and that they are not to take any
     action until you command, “Do it now!” Confirm understanding, for example,
     “OCCUPANTS OF THE VEHICLE, NOD IF YOU UNDERSTAND MY DIRECTION.
     DO IT NOW!”
     5.9.2.2. Next, direct the driver to remove his left hand from the roof, reach across, turn
     off the ignition, and remove the keys. Then extend the left hand, holding the keys, outside
     the window Command the driver to throw the keys back toward the sound of your voice.
     You may, as an alternative, command them to drop the keys directly outside the window
     or that the driver throw the keys outward. Remember, follow each and every step with the
     command, “DO IT NOW!”.
     5.9.2.3. Command the driver to extend his or her hands outside the door and unlatch it
     from the outside door handle. Next, have the driver push the door open with the left foot,
     slowly step outside, and face away from the sound of your voice. The driver-side door of
     the suspect vehicle should remain open. Security police remain in a position of cover at
     all times during this procedure.
     5.9.2.4. Command the driver to turn a complete circle counterclockwise (to his/her left)
     keeping hands as high as possible and elbows locked. As the suspect turns, look for
     weapons. Stop the suspect from turning once he/she is facing away from you.
     5.9.2.5. Instruct the suspect to keep his/her hands high, elbows locked, and start backing
     up toward the sound of your voice. You will direct the suspect back towards your partner,
     ultimately placing the suspect at a disadvantage in the prone position for your partner to
     handcuff. While you direct the suspect back, you will cover the suspect with your
     weapon. Your partner will continue to cover the remaining vehicle occupants. Once you
     verify your partner is ready to handcuff the suspect, you will then cover the remaining
     suspects in the vehicle. The apprehending patrol then becomes responsible for the
     apprehension and control of the suspect.
     5.9.2.6. Remove all occupants from the driver’s side, if possible. After each occupant
     exits, the process begins again. The key is to maintain absolute control over all the
     occupants in the vehicle so that they are always within your sight and within the sight of
     all backup patrols.
     5.9.2.7. As each suspect steps back between the two patrol cars, he or she is stopped just
     behind the curtain of light and just in front of the primary vehicle’s front door. The
     apprehending and search patrol commands the suspect to take a prone position at which
     time he/she is handcuffed.
     5.9.2.8. Suspects will remain face-down on the ground until all are handcuffed and
     searched. Then secure the suspects in security police vehicles.
 70                                       AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010


       5.9.2.9. After securing all occupants approach the suspect vehicle. If possible, use a
       MWD for this purpose. If a MWD is unavailable, consider a ruse, challenging any
       remaining suspects to surrender. On occasion someone hiding in the vehicle has surprised
       patrols. Once you or the MWD have cleared the vehicle, thoroughly inventory all
       contents of the trunk and the interior. Use extreme caution.
5.10. Transporting Personnel. The safety of the Security Forces member must be ensured
when transporting persons in custody. See AFMAN 31-222, Security Forces Use of Force
Manual, for transporting and handcuffing information.
5.11. Response Procedures. The Air Provost patrol is usually the first authoritative official to
arrive at the scene of an incident. There are many types of incidents Security Forces manage.
Regardless of the type of emergency, operate the vehicle with extreme caution. Driving under
emergency conditions does not relieve drivers from the responsibility to drive with due regard
for safety of all persons, nor will these provisions protect the driver from consequences of his/her
disregard for the safety of others. Respond to an incident as Code 1 (Routine), Code 2 (Urgent)
or Code 3 (Emergency). Most often the BDOC/ECC controller will direct the response code.
However, situations will occur requiring the Security Forces member to make the proper
response decision.
   5.11.1. Response Codes. When a call is assigned Code 1, respond by observing all
   applicable traffic laws. Never use emergency lights or sirens for any routine call. If the
   operator becomes aware of circumstances unknown to the dispatching agency, the vehicle
   operator may upgrade the response to Code 2 or Code 3. A call requiring an immediate
   response to a non-life-threatening emergency is normally assigned a Code 2 or “urgent”
   priority. Respond by observing all applicable traffic laws. Use emergency lights for all
   urgent calls. Sirens are not authorized. A call requiring an immediate response to a life-
   threatening emergency or in response to an emergency involving Air Force protection level
   resource is normally assigned an “emergency” or Code 3 priority. The use of emergency
   lights and sirens are normally mandatory; however, use common sense when approaching the
   scene of the emergency. If the emergency lights and sirens put Security Forces, victims or
   bystanders in peril, turn them off at a safe distance from the scene.
   5.11.2. Arriving at the Scene. When responding to any incident, the patrol person should
   mentally prepare him/herself to perform the necessary duties. The primary functions at the
   scene are to preserve the scene, help victims and maintain communications with the
   BDOC/ECC controller and other patrols. Upon arrival at an incident, ensure the patrol
   vehicle is properly parked. Avoid having the patrol vehicle blocked by debris, other vehicles
   or on-scene obstructions. There may be additional units (fire or ambulance) enroute, thus, do
   not block the entrance to the scene. Once the scene is secured:
       5.11.2.1. Assess the situation.
       5.11.2.2. Neutralize hostile situations.
       5.11.2.3. Attend to any injured.
       5.11.2.4. Keep the control center and other patrols informed of the status of the situation.
       5.11.2.5. Identify backup requirements (Security Forces, fire, and ambulance).
       5.11.2.6. Identify witnesses and advise them to remain at the scene for interviews.

       5.11.2.7. Protect and process the crime or accident scene.
       5.11.2.8. Establish a Parking Plan and an Entry Control Point (ECP).
5.12. Funds Escort Procedures. See AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, chapter 25, paragraph
25.5. for guidance.
5.13. Arming Escorts. The commander bases his/her decision to arm escorts based on the local
criminal threat. Give specific consideration to the threat, time of day, route of travel, amount of
funds and backup response/MWD units available. Those personnel armed for the purpose of
escorting funds must comply with AFI 31- 207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force
Personnel.
5.14. Escorts and Fund Carriers. The Integrated Defense Plan (IDP) will establish procedures
to detail the manner in which escorts and fund carriers operate both on and off base. These
procedures should cover the positioning of the escort with relation to the fund carrier while in
vehicles or on foot and the action(s) to take in the event of robbery.
5.15. Escort Procedures. The Integrated Base Defense Council (IBDC), in concert with the
installation DFC, will establish government fund escort procedures. Formalize (document) these
procedures in the Integrated Defense Plan (IDP). Tailor the procedures to the local threat, but
address the following topics in complete detail:
   5.15.1. Fund Activity Process:
       5.15.1.1. Frequent daytime deposits to prevent large cash build-ups.
       5.15.1.2. Vary deposit times.
       5.15.1.3. Address fund storage limits.
       5.15.1.4. Particularly address those activities that repeatedly exceed fund storage limits
       and routinely make deposits at closing as this type of steady routine creates an easy
       opportunity for theft.
       5.15.1.5. Alternative procedures should Security Forces be unable to provide the
       required escort (e.g., contract armored car service).
   5.15.2. Fund courier procedures:
       5.15.2.1. Establish identification and duress procedures with Security Forces in advance
       of fund movement.
       5.15.2.2. Drive a separate vehicle--vary route, time of day and, if possible, approach to
       depository.
       5.15.2.3. Understand Security Forces role--Security Forces do not:
           5.15.2.3.1. Carry funds containers.
           5.15.2.3.2. Provide transportation.
           5.15.2.3.3. Have access to funds.
       5.15.2.4. Establish procedures for off base movement of funds (coordinate with Security
       Forces, civil law enforcement, off base depository)--RECOMMEND armored car service.
   5.15.3. Security Forces procedures:
 72                                     AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010


       5.15.3.1. Whenever possible, augment high value escorts with one armed patrol or one
       MWD patrol, as determined locally by the IDC.
       5.15.3.2. Mark escort vehicles with all emergency equipment (lights, sirens, PA system,
       land-mobile radio, spotlight). Use the following guidelines:
          5.15.3.2.1. Obey traffic codes.
          5.15.3.2.2. Use light bar and sirens only for emergencies.
          5.15.3.2.3. Follow courier vehicle in a manner to preclude association with being
          stopped or trapped together while maintaining constant visual observation (often this
          is nothing more than prudent vehicle separation for the posted speed limit).
   5.15.4. Define communications procedures:
       5.15.4.1. Coordinate escort itinerary (time and place of departure, route, destination and
       estimated time of arrival) off net--recommend in person with BDOC/ECC controller.
       5.15.4.2. Security checks (required at start, periodic and upon successful completion of
       the deposit).
       5.15.4.3. Duress alternatives.
       5.15.4.4. Comm-out (loss of communications with a high value escort should result in
       anti-robbery procedures initiation until status of escort can be determined).
   5.15.5. Develop backup emergency response procedures.
   5.15.6. Conduct periodic Resource Protection (RP) Survey.
       5.15.6.1. Critically analyze physical security measures afforded the depository (lighting,
       access/ visibility, egress/ingress routes, structure and surrounding structure suitability,
       cover and concealment locations).
       5.15.6.2. Develop and coordinate compensatory measures for deficiencies up and down
       the chain (e.g., RP monitor to operations to flight personnel and RP monitor to the DFC
       to the IDC).
       5.15.6.3. Elevate and send deficiencies promptly to the IDC.
   5.15.7. Empower patrols:
       5.15.7.1. Encourage patrols to report deficiencies and recommend countermeasures.
       5.15.7.2. Act on those recommendations.
       5.15.7.3. Reward good ideas.
5.16. Building Checks. One of the Security Forces responsibilities under the Installation
Security Program is to make security checks of buildings, repositories and other areas.
Conducting building checks is an excellent form of proactive crime prevention. Building checks
offer:
   5.16.1. Visibility of Security Forces, on patrol, to the Air Force community.
AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010                                                          73


   5.16.2. A public relations opportunity to meet workers in their environment and provide
   them assurance their professional property will be protected when they are away from their
   duty station.
   5.16.3. Keeps vandals and would-be thieves at bay; uncertain as to when and where Security
   Forces patrols might arrive.
   5.16.4. Provides Air Provost patrols an opportunity to learn building layouts, likely avenues
   of approach/escape, safe and efficient response routes. This benefit applies not only to non-
   duty hours, but will improve response capabilities and enhance “officer safety” when
   answering calls for assistance during duty hours.
   5.16.5. Some of the facilities Security Forces members check house funds, weapons,
   munitions, classified material and drugs. Patrol persons may also have to check supply
   points and areas with high-theft or high-value equipment. Be familiar with the kind of work
   performed in each facility, potential hazards of stored materials (if any), and the exact
   location of resources in the building. Take time to learn as much as possible about the
   facility. Meet the building custodian and discuss his/her concerns—this information may be
   extremely valuable during an incident at the facility. Responding to a crime in progress is
   not the time to learn about a building.
5.17. Building Check Procedure. Each unit normally has a locally produced building check
sheet that lists the facilities and areas Security Forces check. At a minimum, the check sheet
should include annotating the time the patrol person checked the structure and the results of the
security check.
   5.17.1. Personnel may check the same buildings and areas each day, so it is important that
   Security Forces personnel do not set a predictable pattern. Try approaching from a different
   direction each time and do not check the same structures at the same time each day. If the
   routes and times are predictable, someone can easily avoid being caught in the act of
   breaking in or burglarizing. As patrol persons approach, be alert for suspicious vehicles or
   activity. Notify the BDOC/ECC controller when the patrol arrives, before start of the
   security check and once checks are completed.
   5.17.2. As patrol persons approach the building, try to stay out of well-lit areas and stay alert
   for suspicious activity. Fire escapes, rooftops and buildings constructed off the ground or on
   stilts provide perfect hiding places for an intruder to gain access to a building. When
   conducting building checks, look for obvious signs of forced entry such as broken windows,
   pry marks or open doors. Physically check all entrances to the building that the Security
   Forces member can reach. Try to open doors and windows (within reason) and turn door
   handles. For places not within reach, look closely for signs of forced entry. When possible,
   also look inside the building through the windows. Again, try not to establish a routine or
   pattern for checking buildings—be unpredictable and this will increase chances of catching
   someone in the act of breaking and entering.
   5.17.3. If a Security Force’s member finds a building with sign(s) of forced entry, take cover
   immediately at a position to observe the building. Once in a covered position, contact the
   BDOC. Inform the controller of the incident, building number, patrol person’s location and
   any other important facts. The BDOC/ECC controller will dispatch backup patrols and
   contact the building custodian. Do not enter the building until backup patrols arrive. Once
 74                                    AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010


   back up arrives, coordinate a plan of action with the on-scene patrols and the controller. If
   available, use MWD teams to search and clear the building. Once Security Forces have
   cleared the building, the building custodian checks to see whether theft or vandalism has
   taken place or someone merely forgot to secure the building upon completion of the building
   search.
       5.17.3.1. If a Security Force member finds a building unsecure, follow the same
       procedures in para 5.17.3, except, Security Forces should not enter the building until the
       building custodian is on the scene. Once the custodian arrives, Security Forces search the
       building, apprehend any unauthorized persons and remove them from the area. The
       building custodian checks to see whether theft or vandalism has taken place or someone
       merely forgot to secure the building upon completion of the building search.
       5.17.3.2. Accomplish AF Form 3545A, Incident Report, on all unsecured buildings
       which has items missing, signs of forced entry, or a protection level asset.
5.18. Building and Area Searches. The same techniques used for searching buildings (with the
addition of the grid/strip search) can be used when searching areas.
   5.18.1. General Inspection Prior to Search. Before beginning any area search, there are
   certain steps to take.
       5.18.1.1. Make an overall observation of the area to be searched.
       5.18.1.2. Consider the size of the area, terrain and the items or personnel being sought.
       5.18.1.3. Determine the amount of people needed to conduct a search of the area.
       5.18.1.4. Determine the systematic search pattern to use.
   5.18.2. Item-to-Item Search. Enter the scene and go to the first apparent item of evidence,
   visually observe the item, then move to the next closest item. Repeat this process until the
   room or area has been systematically scrutinized.
   5.18.3. Concentric Circle (Spiral) Search. This search is conducted in small outdoor areas
   when patrol persons believe evidence has been dropped or placed a distance from the crime
   scene. The search can be done in a counter-clockwise direction, but the clockwise direction
   is recommended to ensure uniformity. Begin at the crime scene and work outwards. When
   searching a large area, such as fields or woods, conduct the search in ever-widening circles
   from a central point.
   5.18.4. Zone or Sector Search. If a large area such as an office building or warehouse must
   be searched, subdivide the scene into sectors. Assign individuals to each designated sector
   for searching. Start searching the sector or zone in which the incident occurred and work
   outward. The search should be conducted, not only of the area in which the crime or incident
   occurred, but also the area beyond the scene, when possible.
   5.18.5. Strip and Grid Searches. Strip and grid searches are normally used in large outdoor
   areas.
       5.18.5.1. When using the strip search, divide the area into strips approximately four feet
       wide. The search starts at one end and moves back and forth across the area from one
       side to the other.
AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010                                                         75


      5.18.5.2. By following a strip search with another strip search conducted at right angles
      to the first, a grid search (sometimes called the double strip search) is performed. It
      covers the same area twice, helping ensure no areas are missed.
5.19. Crime Scenes. Crime scenes are very fragile and if improperly handled, valuable
evidence may be lost or destroyed.
   5.19.1. As soon as possible, the scene of a crime must be protected. However, do not
   interfere with medical personnel performing their duties.
   5.19.2. Be aware that individuals involved in the crime could still be present at the scene.
   Witnesses and physical evidence, such as fingerprints, footprints and weapons may all be
   present.
   5.19.3. Preserve the crime scene by keeping it in the same physical condition it was at the
   time of arrival of the first Security Forces individual. Do not allow objects to be touched,
   stains to be walked on or footprints or tire marks to be destroyed. If evidence is disturbed, it
   could cause the investigator to reach false conclusions about the crime. Disturbed evidence
   can also cause an investigator to develop false leads that could preclude solving the crime.
   Do not permit the introduction of unrelated materials such as cigarettes or candy wrappers to
   a crime scene. Do not allow anyone to use the facilities within the scene such as telephones,
   toilets or sinks.
   5.19.4. When a crime scene is adequately protected, it allows the investigator to review the
   scene exactly as it was. Continued preservation is necessary to permit the investigation team
   freedom of movement and to guarantee continued protection against destruction or
   contamination of evidence by either authorized or unauthorized persons.
   5.19.5. Initial actions at a crime scene:
      5.19.5.1. After being dispatched to a crime scene, proceed quickly and safely. Observe
      the area en route to the scene and note any suspicious persons and vehicles fleeing or
      loitering around the scene. Upon initial arrival at the scene, contact the BDOC/ECC
      controller and let him/her know patrols have arrived. Advise the controller of the status
      on the scene and request medical aid or backup patrols as appropriate. Immediately, after
      communicating with the controller, take steps to protect the scene. Initial actions should
      include:
          5.19.5.1.1. Recording the date, arrival time and weather conditions.
          5.19.5.1.2. Providing first aid and ensuring arrangements are made for medical
          attention when an injured or deceased person is present. The scene should not be
          disturbed except to have medical aid given to the injured or to have a physician
          examine the deceased victim(s). Be aware of any alterations of the scene. Ensure a
          roster is maintained to determine who has entered and left the scene. This will be
          valuable at a later time when conducting interviews.
          5.19.5.1.3. Apprehend/Detain any suspects or offenders at the scene.
          5.19.5.1.4. Secure the scene by using Security Forces (or other responsible persons)
          to keep curious persons away and to keep witnesses, suspects and victims from
          disturbing anything if the scene is not completely protected.
76                                   AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010


            5.19.5.1.4.1. If required, redirect traffic to prevent any disturbance of the scene
            until a complete examination is made. The body of a deceased victim must not be
            covered until it has been processed for evidence. Covering a body before the
            examination may destroy evidence.
            5.19.5.1.4.2. Act immediately to protect items of possible evidentiary value that
            could be destroyed. Rain, snow and fire are elements that can destroy evidence.
            A piece of canvas can be used to cover impressions in the earth that are exposed
            to rain. Personnel can place a wooden or cardboard box over impressions in the
            snow. A clean, sturdy object/piece of material should be used to prevent cross
            contamination. Also use something sturdy enough that won’t collapse onto the
            evidence itself. Substances that can melt need to be shielded from the sun or
            other heat sources. Items such as food and blood should be covered to protect
            them from contamination.
     5.19.5.2. Notify the local AFOSI, if after examining the scene, the incident is beyond the
     purview of Security Forces. Follow the requirements listed in the Security Forces/AFOSI
     Investigative matrix contained in AFI 31-206, Security Forces Investigations.
     5.19.5.3. Ensure Security Forces members record the names of people at the scene who
     may be witnesses and separate them. Keep a record of all personnel who enter and exit
     the scene utilizing the AF Fm 1109, Visitor Control Log, as soon as feasible. As soon as
     possible, remove them from the immediate area.
     5.19.5.4. Accomplish preliminary questioning of complainant, witness and victim to
     determine the general extent of the crime or incident. Ensure victims, witnesses and
     complainants are given the DD Form 2701, Initial Information for Victims and Witnesses
     of Crime. If Security Forces personnel find they are beginning to suspect someone of
     actually committing the crime, do not forget to advise personnel of their rights prior to
     questioning. If you believe AFOSI will take the lead in the investigation, attempt to
     separate all witnesses, victims and subjects until AFOSI arrives. Do not continue
     questioning the individual until AFOSI agrees to the investigative steps. If there is a
     potential subject identified do not question or interrogate him/her, if at all possible. Do
     not routinely advise the individual of their rights until AFOSI is briefed on the case.
     However, if the subject wants to talk and AFOSI has not arrived, advisement of Article
     31 or Fifth Amendment rights may be necessary. As in all other instances, Article 31
     rights are only required prior to questioning a military member suspected of committing
     an offense and Miranda warnings for civilians are required if the interrogation takes place
     in a custodial setting.
     5.19.5.5. Document all the names of persons officially present. Only those who are
     needed to assist the investigator should be present in the immediate vicinity. If required,
     ask officials not associated with the scene, but of official capacity, to refrain from
     disturbing objects at the scene.
AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010                                                        77


                                            Chapter 6

    BASE DEFENSE OPERATIONS CENTER/EMERGENCY CONTROL CENTER
                              DUTIES

6.1. General Information. Individuals should be selected for their ability to function under
stress, communicate effectively with people, learn and think quickly, use their leadership skills
and for their maturity. The BDOC/ECC controller must have the experience and ability to take
control and direct flight operations when the need arises.
6.2. Major Geographic Locations on Base.
   6.2.1. Prior to being assigned as a BDOC/ECC controller, an individual should be familiar
   with the geography of the base and the location of facilities, including the flight line, if
   applicable. This knowledge is necessary to perform the tasks required.
   6.2.2. All base vulnerabilities should be identified, e.g., sections of base perimeter not
   fenced, areas of poor visibility, isolated areas of base perimeter where entry could go
   undetected, etc. The majority of the vulnerable areas on the base should be identified in
   applicable local documents, (e.g., an installation security plan).
   6.2.3. Problem areas (locations where the crime rate is high or disturbances occur
   frequently) on a base must be well known to the BDOC/ECC controller. It is the
   BDOC/ECC controller’s responsibility to keep abreast of local problems in order to
   effectively use patrols.
6.3. Contact and Use Local Law Enforcement Agencies When Required.
   6.3.1. At each base, there are other law enforcement agencies available to support the
   mission should the need arise. It is important to know when to call each agency for
   assistance. Some local agencies that may be contacted include:
       6.3.1.1. AFOSI. NOTE: If necessary, AFOSI will notify other agencies such as the
       Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
       6.3.1.2. Local/Host Nation Police.
       6.3.1.3. Sheriff’s Department.
       6.3.1.4. State Police/Highway Patrol.
   6.3.2. Prior to contacting other agencies for assistance, the local jurisdiction’s restrictions
   must be determined.
   6.3.3. Many means of communicating with civilian agencies are available.              Standard
   methods used are landlines or radios.
   6.3.4. Memorandums of Agreements between base and civilian authorities should be made
   to expedite assistance and define guidelines to be used. Many off base law enforcement
   agencies have school resource officers who work on military installations. Ensure these are
   addressed in agreements.
6.4. Identify Investigative Jurisdiction.
 78                                    AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010


   6.4.1. The BDOC/ECC controller should be familiar with AFI 31-206, Security Forces
   Investigations Program. This document will assist the investigator in determining
   investigative jurisdiction over a purely military offense by using the investigative matrix.
   6.4.2. The BDOC/ECC controller should be aware of which local law enforcement agencies
   have jurisdiction over civilians who commit offenses within the boundaries of the
   installation. Often times, two or more local agencies may have jurisdiction over incidents
   involving civilians. Local guidelines should be established to assist in determining which
   agency to call for the various types of offenses that may occur. When in doubt contact the
   local SJA for clarification/advice.
6.5. Identify the Legal Jurisdiction. The military always has jurisdiction over UCMJ offenses
committed by military members, anywhere in the world. Local civilian governments have
jurisdiction over civilian criminal offenses committed by military members in the local
community. However, they may also have jurisdiction over offenses committed on a military
installation, depending on the legal jurisdiction of the land on which the installation sits. To
further complicate matters, some installations are a mix of various types. These are the types of
jurisdiction that may apply:
   6.5.1. Exclusive Jurisdiction: The federal government has sole authority to enforce the law
   on the installation. Civilians who commit offenses in areas of exclusive federal jurisdiction
   are cited or detained and handed over to federal civilian authorities, such as a federal
   magistrate, the U.S. Marshal or the FBI.
   6.5.2. Concurrent Jurisdiction: Both the federal and state governments have authority to
   enforce the law on the installation. When there is a conflict, the federal government prevails
   under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution (Art. VI, Clause 2, U.S Constitution).
   6.5.3. Reciprocal/Partial Jurisdiction: Both the federal and state governments have some
   authority, but neither has exclusive power. For example, a state may have retained criminal
   jurisdiction over an installation or part of an installation (housing areas, for example). Again,
   in a conflict, the federal supremacy applies.
   6.5.4. Proprietary Jurisdiction: The U.S. has the same rights as any property owner—the
   U.S. and its personnel on base are treated as tenants, subject to the state law (and federal laws
   that do not rely on territorial jurisdiction, such as espionage, bank robbery, tax fraud,
   counterfeiting, etc). The federal government still maintains sovereign immunity and
   supremacy for inherently governmental functions.
6.6. Communications.
   6.6.1. The base telephone system is used for communications between the BDOC/ECC,
   other base agencies/offices, fixed posts, guard towers, etc. Telephones will be military,
   commercial or field systems.
   6.6.2. Various types of non-tactical radios are used to maintain communications between the
   control center and patrols. The radio is the primary means of communications between the
   control center and patrols.
       6.6.2.1. The base station radio is either a fixed or transportable radio that can be operated
       by either a battery or 110/220 voltage, 50/60 Hz. Operators must be proficient in the
       operation of the radio. The BDOC/ECC controller maintains radio discipline and all radio
AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010                                                         79


      communication in order to sustain an effective radio net on behalf of the on duty flight
      sergeant. Security Forces who use the radio net will use “clear speech” radio procedures
      at all times, with appropriate call signs, keeping the message short.
      6.6.2.2. Ensure the phonetic alphabet (Attachment 2) is used for abbreviations and
      words which are hard to understand.
      6.6.2.3. Ensure procedure words (pro-words) (Attachment 3) are used in radio
      communication to shorten sending time and to simplify clear reception.
      6.6.2.4. The mobile two-way radio is used by vehicle patrols to maintain
      communications with other patrols as well as the BDOC/ECC controller.
      6.6.2.5. Walking patrols, mobile patrols and those individuals on fixed posts use the
      portable hand held radio.
      6.6.2.6. When transmitting members should use the Size, Activity, Location, Uniform,
      Time, Equipment (SALUTE) report format.
          6.6.2.6.1. Size. How many personnel do you observe?
          6.6.2.6.2. Activity. What are they doing?
          6.6.2.6.3. Location. Where are they at?
          6.6.2.6.4. Uniform. What are they wearing?
          6.6.2.6.5. Time. Self explainatory. Either in local or zulu time.
          6.6.2.6.6. Equipment. What weapons, tools, material, etc they have on them?
6.7. Routine Duties.
   6.7.1. BDOC/ECC controllers must be able to take information quickly and accurately as
   well as give information and answer questions. They must be excellent communicators and
   exhibit a positive and professional attitude when dealing with the public. No matter how
   hectic and stressful circumstances become (multiple incidents, hostile telephone callers, etc.);
   controllers must maintain their composure and control of the situation. The need for a
   positive, professional image cannot be over emphasized. BDOC/ECC controllers are
   normally selected by the flight leadership and entrusted with this critical task. BDOC/ECC
   controllers act with the full knowledge and approval of flight leadership. Flight leadership
   retains responsibility for all actions performed on their behalf by BDOC/ECC controllers.
   6.7.2. Dispatching patrols is a very important task of the controller. Knowing the most
   direct routes to incidents as well as hazards is a must to assist patrols. The BDOC/ECC
   controller must know the call signs and dispatch accordingly.
   6.7.3. Keeping track of all patrols is a very important part of a controller’s duties. Knowing
   who is posted on which post and the general area of each patrol are very important when
   dispatches are made.
   6.7.4. The BDOC/ECC controller must always keep the Flight Sergeant and Flight
   Commander informed of all activities, incidents and the status of each.
 80                                   AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010


   6.7.5. Maintaining forms is another duty of the BDOC/ECC controller. Filling out required
   forms and processing them is a massive job that must be done accurately and in accordance
   with governing directives.
   6.7.6. Alarm panel board must be readily visible to the person behind the control desk, but
   not obvious to the public. It is imperative that the BDOC/ECC controller be highly
   knowledgeable of the alarm systems. He/she is responsible for conducting alarm system
   checks and reporting deficiencies. The BDOC/ECC controller will also maintain a list of
   persons authorized to open and close alarmed facilities as well as local authentication codes
   devised and used to verify the openings and closing of such facilities. In addition to the
   authentication codes, the BDOC/ECC controller must have access to duress codes for each
   facility. In case of activation, the BDOC/ECC controller must be familiar with the base anti-
   robbery procedures and use locally devised checklists to ensure adequate response to
   incidents. Fund activities will be given a priority listing. If multiple alarms occur, the
   BDOC/ECC controller will dispatch patrols according to established priorities.
   6.7.7. When the base detention facility is located adjacent to the BDOC/ECC, the
   BDOC/ECC controller may be responsible for monitoring the facility to ensure order and
   health and welfare of the inmates. Local procedures must be developed to assist the
   BDOC/ECC controller in the execution of this duty. The BDOC/ECC controller must be
   versed in detention transfer, release and emergency procedures used locally.
6.8. Emergency Duties.
   6.8.1. Each Security Forces unit should have a locally devised duress code system to
   communicate between posts, patrols and the BDOC/ECC controller to ensure assistance,
   should the need arise. The BDOC/ECC controller must remain alert at all times. Should a
   duress situation arise, it must be handled expeditiously and effectively.
   6.8.2. All bases will have emergency notification/recall procedures. Normally, it is the
   responsibility of the BDOC/ECC controller to implement these procedures during emergency
   situations. Checklists should be devised locally to ensure all essential personnel have been
   notified and/or recalled.
   6.8.3. The BDOC/ECC controller should have a checklist available to cover emergencies
   which could arise within the local area, for example:
      6.8.3.1. Civil disturbance.
      6.8.3.2. Anti-robbery.
      6.8.3.3. Natural disaster.
      6.8.3.4. Bomb threat.
      6.8.3.5. Aircraft accident.
      6.8.3.6. Anti-hijacking.
      6.8.3.7. Mass casualty.
      6.8.3.8. Emergency security operations.
      6.8.3.9. Emergency corrections/detention procedures.

         6.8.3.9.1. Prisoner escapes.
         6.8.3.9.2. Prisoner disorder.
         6.8.3.9.3. Power failure.
         6.8.3.9.4. Fire.
     6.8.3.10. HAZMAT procedures.
     6.8.3.11. FPCON measures.
  6.8.4. An emergency generator will be available for power failures at the control center. The
  BDOC/ECC controller must be familiar with the local operating and test procedures to
  ensure a smooth transition to generator power during failures.

                                            Chapter 7

                                   SUPERVISORY DUTIES

7.1. Qualified to Perform All Duties of Subordinates. Supervisors should be familiar with
and qualified to perform the duties of their immediate subordinates. This allows the supervisor
to accurately assess the requirements of the duty position and to compare them with the skills
and abilities of the subordinate.
7.2. Orient New Personnel. It is the supervisor’s responsibility to orient his/her new personnel
to the unit, its mission and unique aspects of the subordinate’s duty position. The supervisor
should make the effort to make the new subordinate feel welcome and be available to answer
questions.
7.3. Determine Work Priorities. A supervisor must identify critical tasks required and allocate
manpower based on the requirements and necessity of each task. In most Security Forces units, a
post priority chart will be used to allocate manpower. As available manpower declines, posts of
less importance go unmanned before those of higher priority. Similarly, a supervisor must decide
which tasks are to be completed with available manpower.
7.4. Planning and Scheduling Work Assignments/Assign Personnel to Duty Positions . The
supervisor should maintain a record of each subordinate’s qualifications and certifications to
assist in assigning posts. When possible, personnel should be rotated through each post for
which they are qualified in order to maintain proficiency.
7.5. Establish Performance Standards. Supervisors must instill a work ethic in each of their
subordinates and set and maintain the standards that each subordinate will be judged in the
performance of their duties.
7.6. Evaluate Work Performance. Each supervisor is tasked with observing the performance
of their subordinates and relating these observations to established performance standards.
7.7. Counsel Personnel. Supervisors should regularly meet with their subordinates and discuss
with them, any issues involving duty performance. These discussions should cover positive and
negative aspects of the subordinate’s performance. A plan should be developed between the
supervisor and subordinate, incorporating verifiable goals and objectives, to outline how any
deficiencies will be corrected. This should be a continuing process and should not only be
limited to scheduled performance feedback sessions. The supervisor should always be available
to discuss and offer advice to subordinates concerning personal problems. If any particular
problem is beyond the supervisor’s knowledge or expertise, they should make every effort to
refer the subordinate to an appropriate person/agency who can help. Counseling sessions
(positive or negative) should always be documented.
7.8. Initiate Corrective Action for Substandard Performance. If a subordinate demonstrates
substandard duty performance, the supervisor should investigate to determine the cause. Once it
has been determined that a performance deficiency is not the result of lack of training, defective
training or other circumstances beyond the subordinate’s control, the supervisor should initiate
corrective action for sub-standard performance. For minor situations, a verbal or written
counseling should normally be sufficient to correct the problem. In more severe circumstances,
or in cases of repeated deficiencies, the supervisor should consider a verbal or written reprimand.
AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010                                                          83


In serious cases, the supervisor should consult with his/her chain of command and possibly
forward the action to the commander for non-judicial action. Again, it is important to document
all counseling sessions.
7.9. Review and Write Correspondence/Reports. There are numerous documents generated
in a Security Forces unit. These documents include, but are not limited to letters, memorandums,
blotters, incident reports and performance reports. It is the responsibility of supervisors, at each
level, to review correspondence and reports written by subordinates for content, grammar,
neatness and accuracy.
7.10. Conduct Post Checks. On-duty supervisory personnel conduct post checks to ensure
posted personnel are alert and knowledgeable of the assigned duties and responsibilities. Post
checks include an inspection of Security Forces facilities and equipment. Ensure some of the
time is spent getting to know flight personnel. This can be a great time to discover any problems
a subordinate may have.
7.11. Post Visits. Post visits are a means for senior representatives to visit on-duty Security
Forces to verify their job knowledge and performance in their work environment. It is also a
way to inspect facilities, take questions, detect problem areas, detect morale trends, and ascertain
the welfare of personnel. Conduct post visits during both traditional and non-traditional duty
hours.
7.12. Post Reporting. Report the status of the post to the senior person conducting the post
check or visit.
7.13. Conduct Security Forces Guardmount. Guardmount is a formal military formation
conducted at the start of the Security Forces shift. Use guardmount to determine the readiness of
personnel, to include their appearance as well as mental and physical condition. Use guardmount
to conduct roll call, make announcements, security status briefing, weapons inspection and post
assignments. Flight Sergeants should also use guard-mount as a recognition ceremony for
deserving personnel and for training. For procedures on conducting guardmount refer to
Chapter 2 of this manual.

                                          Chapter 8

                                 CUSTOMS OPERATIONS

8.1. General Concepts of Customs Operations. Security Forces must occasionally conduct
customs inspections; therefore it is imperative personnel understand their purpose, method and
complexity.
   8.1.1. General customs law. All personnel, both military and civilian, must comply with
   customs laws when traveling on civilian aircraft. Upon entry to and departure from the
   United States, personnel on military aircraft must, by law, comply with the border clearance
   requirements of various federal agencies. Federal officials perform border clearance
   functions at foreign clearance bases in the United States. However, US Air Force personnel
   may perform customs functions at special foreign clearance bases where specifically
   authorized by HQ USAF. The US Customs Service authorizes DoD customs inspectors
   (referred to as Military Customs Inspectors (MCIs) to assist US Customs officials at regular
   foreign clearance bases. Local agreements with the appropriate regional commissioner of
   customs govern duties of MCIs at foreign clearance bases.
   8.1.2. Definitions.
       8.1.2.1. Customs Territory of the United States (CTUS). The fifty states, District of
       Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico.
       8.1.2.2. Contraband. Material goods, plant and animal products or pests and articles
       prohibited entry into the customs territory of the United States, including controlled
       substances as defined in 21 U.S.C. 812.
       8.1.2.3. Defense Transportation System (DTS). DTS consists of military controlled air,
       land and sea transportation and terminal facilities.
       8.1.2.4. Examination. The process of scrutinizing personal/government property, parcel
       mail and other DoD cargo, including physical opening of baggage, parcels, cartons,
       containers and disassembly of articles (as required) to determine the contents.
       Examination of personnel involves the physical search for contraband.
       8.1.2.5. Inspection. The detailed observation of personal/government property, letter and
       parcel mail and other DoD cargo, noting their markings and other physical
       characteristics. Inspection of personnel involves observation or oral questioning to
       determine the potential for customs violations.
       8.1.2.6. Sterile area. An enclosed or protected area at origin or enroute stop where
       passengers, baggage or cargo are held to eliminate contact with, or intrusion by,
       unauthorized personnel, plant and animal products as well as pests, subsequent to
       customs inspection until embarkation and loading or re-embarkation and reloading on
       transport for movement into the US.
       8.1.2.7. Amnesty box. A suitable slotted receptacle for small packages/items from which
       contents can be recovered only by opening a locking device.
       8.1.2.8. MCI. MCIs may be commissioned officers, warrant officers or enlisted
       personnel with the rank of E-4 and above, and Department of Defense Civilian
AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010                                                      85


      employees (GS-5 and above) who are citizens of the United States. (Exception: enlisted
      Security Forces personnel, regardless of rank, who have satisfactorily completed a US
      Customs-approved training course and work under direct supervision of a
      noncommissioned officer.)
      8.1.2.9. Military Customs Inspection (Excepted) (MCI (E)). Individuals designated to
      perform customs functions by the Commissioner of Customs at US foreign clearance
      bases. MCI(E)’s are not employed overseas and do not function under the auspices of the
      DoD Military Customs Inspection Program.
8.2. Border Clearance Program.
   8.2.1. U.S. Air Force objectives of the border clearance program are to:
      8.2.1.1. Ensure all entry and departure laws and regulations of the US Government
      border clearance agencies and foreign governments are complied with.
      8.2.1.2. Prevent smuggling of narcotics, dangerous drugs and other contraband on DoD
      aircraft and DoD-controlled aircraft and transportation channels.
      8.2.1.3. Perform customs and anti-smuggling inspections and examinations according to
      instruction in applicable publications.
   8.2.2. USAF basic policy is to:
      8.2.2.1. Reduce re-inspections to prevent inconvenience to passengers and crew
      members, whenever possible.
      8.2.2.2. Provide sterile storage areas at all accredited installations.
      8.2.2.3. Ensure personal property and DoD cargo shipments are safeguarded in sterile
      areas until moved.
      8.2.2.4. Ensure containers with personal and DoD cargo are packed/sealed according to
      instructions.
      8.2.2.5. Prevent the flow of narcotics and dangerous drugs through the US Mail.
      8.2.2.6. Ensure all designated MCIs are properly trained and qualified.
      8.2.2.7. Inspect and examine inter- and intra-theater movements when required by the
      theater commander. In-country flights are not inspected except for cause.
      8.2.2.8. Inspect CONUS departing flights enroute overseas if a specific threat is
      identified or to those remote locations where drugs might be transported from the United
      States. Authority to inspect airframes, passengers, crew, baggage and cargo rests with the
      MAJCOM concerned.
      8.2.2.9. Get customs accreditation at all Air Force overseas locations that process
      passengers, baggage and cargo.
      8.2.2.10. Cooperate fully with the theater commander and the US Customs advisor.
      8.2.2.11. Limit the use of drug detector dog teams on passengers and aircrew members
      moving on DoD aircraft to definite threats.
      8.2.2.12. Receive information.
 86                                     AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010


8.3. Customs Duties and Responsibilities. The installation may have a mission involving
customs operations. If tasked, personnel must have an understanding of the background, terms
and inspection procedures for customs duty within the Air Force. On installations, the Chief of
Transportation oversees the customs, border clearance and anti-smuggling programs. Within the
Air Force, the OPR for customs duties is logistics (ILG). ILG has developed a number of AFIs
detailing specific duties and responsibilities by theater of operation. The DFC will ensure
commensurate customs training is available, if required. Coordinate with AFOSI on customs
investigations or suspected anti-smuggling violations. These documents provide the basis of the
information needed; specifically: 3AFI 24-401, Customs—Europe and AFI 24-405, DoD Foreign
Clearance Guide.
   8.3.1. Defense Force Commander:
       8.3.1.1. Ensure the standards and procedures prescribed by applicable 24-series
       instructions regarding Security Forces responsibilities are met.
       8.3.1.2. Ensure MCIs assigned to Security Forces activities are fully trained and
       qualified.
       8.3.1.3. Give required statistical information to the chief of transportation.
       8.3.1.4. Ensure military narcotic detector dogs are used as required by applicable 24-
       series instructions.
       8.3.1.5. Coordinate with AFOSI on US Customs investigations or suspected anti-
       smuggling violations.
8.4. Training and Appointment. Performing MCI duties requires proper training. The US
Customs Service and other border clearance agencies are available to conduct periodic classes to
train Air Force personnel as MCIs. Appointment as customs inspectors is usually made at the
conclusion of each class. A list of appointees is sent to the individual’s base of assignment.
Installation commanders then designate, in writing, those personnel authorized to perform
customs duties.
8.5. Inspection Procedures. During baggage examinations, Security Forces customs inspectors
also inspect for restricted or prohibited items being imported. Any questions concerning such
items must be referred to the nearest US Customs Office for clarification. The DFC, pending
receipt of disposition instructions, must secure confiscated items. The property is recorded on
AF Form 52, Evidence Tag and a chain of custody provided until final disposition is made.
Report minor violations of customs and related laws and regulations on AF Form 3545A,
Incident Report. A copy of this report should be forwarded to the AFOSI and the US Customs
Office. All major violations will be reported immediately. Normally US Customs will refer
these violations to AFOSI for investigation.
   8.5.1. Initial arrival actions. MCIs must meet all aircraft requiring customs clearance on
   arrival and complete the following:
       8.5.1.1. Collect required border clearance forms from the aircraft commander. Clearance
       forms include the following:
           8.5.1.1.1. Customs Form 7507, General Declaration--required for each flight.
           8.5.1.1.2. A flight order--required for crew members.
AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010                                                       87


          8.5.1.1.3. DD Form 1385, Cargo Manifest--required when the aircraft is carrying
          cargo.
          8.5.1.1.4. Passenger Manifest--required when the aircraft is carrying passengers.
          8.5.1.1.5. Permit to proceed if the mission is proceeding to another location where
          the border clearance requirements will be accomplished.
      8.5.1.2. Ensure passengers and crew members are reminded of restrictions concerning
      departures and removal of cargo, baggage and effects before completion of customs
      inspection.
      8.5.1.3. Passengers and crew members must be controlled and segregated from other
      personnel until their baggage has been customs processed.
   8.5.2. Aircraft inspection. After the passengers have been off-loaded, MCIs board the
   aircraft and conduct a brief inspection for baggage or other personal effects that might have
   been hidden or purposely left behind. If items are found, they will be confiscated and an
   attempt made to establish ownership. A drug detector dog team will be used to inspect all
   aircraft arriving from non-accredited areas. Drug detector dog team will inspect flights
   arriving from accredited areas when available.
8.6. Processing Passengers and Aircrews.
   8.6.1. Examination of declaration. One copy of DD Form 1854, Customs Accompanied
   Baggage Declaration, is collected from each passenger or crewmember immediately before
   baggage inspection. Each declaration is examined for completeness. Check the individual’s
   last date of departure from the US against the date of entry to determine the personal
   exemption entitlement. The price or value of all items declared must be in US currency.
   8.6.2. Correction of errors. Before the inspection begins, personnel are permitted to add
   articles to or amend their declarations. An article may be added to the declaration after the
   inspection has begun only if:
      8.6.2.1. No undeclared or undervalued items have been found.
      8.6.2.2. The inspector is satisfied there was no fraudulent intent.
   8.6.3. Assessment of duty. All articles imported into the Customs Territory of the United
   States are subject to customs duty, unless specifically exempted by the tariff laws. These
   laws provide for certain items to be admitted duty free, and, in addition, allow a variety of
   exemptions. MCIs do not assess or collect duties or tax. A US Customs official computes
   the amount of duty to be paid from the customs declaration when it is sent to the appropriate
   US Customs Service Office. Therefore, a legible and understandable declaration must be
   submitted.
   8.6.4. Inspection of accompanied baggage. MCI(E)s conduct an inspection of all
   accompanied baggage and personnel arriving from non-accredited locations. The local US
   Customs inspector establishes what percent of accompanied baggage will be examined by
   MCI(E)s. These inspections should focus on:
      8.6.4.1. Prohibited and restricted articles with particular attention to controlled
      substances, firearms and plant/animal products.
88                                    AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010


     8.6.4.2. Undeclared suitable articles.
  8.6.5. Inspection of personnel by narcotic detector dogs. Detector dogs are not used to
  directly inspect passengers or crew unless there is specific reason to believe controlled
  substances are on board.
  8.6.6. Examination of baggage and personnel. Baggage and personnel are examined from an
  non-accredited location only if:
     8.6.6.1. Undeclared or prohibited items belonging to the individual have been found
     during the inspection.
     8.6.6.2. There is other specific reason to suspect a particular passenger.
     8.6.6.3. An examination is directed by a US Customs official.
  8.6.7. Inspection or examination of civilians. When a civilian objects to being inspected or
  examined, the individual is detained and a US Customs official contacted for instructions.
  8.6.8. Violations.
     8.6.8.1. Minor violations. In dealing with passengers, Customs evaluates and normally
     treats minor and inadvertent violations committed by inexperienced travelers in a lenient
     manner. For example, articles acquired abroad and not declared or undervalued, if their
     importation is not prohibited or restricted, and:
         8.6.8.1.1. Would be duty free and nontaxable if they had been properly declared.
         Such articles may be passed free with a note made on the declaration by the inspector
         that this was done according to 24-series instructions.
         8.6.8.1.2. As a group, the articles have insignificant value.
         8.6.8.1.3. Items would not be totally free of duty and tax if properly declared, but the
         inspector believes that there was no fraudulent intent. Such property may be
         admitted, but fully described on the declaration so that the US Customs official may
         assess appropriate penalties.
     8.6.8.2. Major violations. Any violation that requires personal search, seizure or
     excessive delay of a crewmember or passenger is a major violation. These are cases
     where:
         8.6.8.2.1. The violation involves willful, concealment of articles, labels removed
         from clothing, false or double invoices or the passenger’s own admission.
         8.6.8.2.2. The violation is not established to be willful, but involves a large sum of
         money. For example, the value of the undeclared article or the margin between the
         declared and the real value is such as casts a doubt the declaration was made in error.
         No violation of this type is deemed minor by reason of the wealth of the violator.
         8.6.8.2.3. The violation is of commercial nature, such as for resale or as a business
         gift. The character of the undeclared or undervalued items, the passenger’s
         admission, or other evidence can determine this.
         8.6.8.2.4. The violation involves prohibited articles such as controlled substances.
AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010                                                        89


   8.6.9. Advisement of rights. In all instances where personnel are suspected of having
   committed a customs violation, the suspect will be advised of his/her rights under provision
   of Article 31, UCMJ or the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution, before questioning.
      8.6.9.1. If the case is deemed to be within AFOSI purview, all attempts will be made to
      wait for AFOSI before conducting the rights advisement.
   8.6.10. Detention of personnel and baggage. The question of detaining personnel or baggage
   usually is decided by the seriousness of the offense. In minor violations, personnel and
   baggage normally are dealt with according to paragraph 7.6.8.1. above. Whereas, in cases
   involving major violations, a US Customs inspector is requested to provide instructions for
   the disposition of both the offender and the property in question. As a general rule, contact a
   US Customs official for help.
   8.6.11. Receipts. In all cases where property is detained, an AF Form 52, Evidence Tag, is
   completed properly.
8.7. Assistance of US Customs Inspectors. The US Customs Service has requested that US
Customs officials be contacted in each of the following situations:
   8.7.1. Civilian passengers. For clearance of flights carrying civilian personnel.
   8.7.2. Unapproved aircraft landing. In cases where unapproved aircraft land as a result of
   adverse weather or mechanical difficulties.
   8.7.3. Major violations. In cases where major customs violations are discovered.
   8.7.4. Examination of baggage. In cases where the examinations of baggage is considered
   necessary.
   8.7.5. Procedural questions or doubts.     In cases where questions or doubts exist as to
   procedures.
   8.7.6. Each Special Foreign Clearance Base is provided a list of customs officials who can
   help when needed. In some instances, customs officials may not be able to come to the base;
   however, they can advise Security Forces customs inspectors how to proceed under varying
   circumstances.

                                     COMMUNICATIONS

9.1. Security Forces Communications Requirements. Of all supporting equipment and
facilities used in security operations, the security communications system is one of the most
important. Through this system, voice reports signaling detected events are transmitted to
control centers. This transmission starts Security Forces reaction to threatening events.
Installations supporting protection level resources must have a Security Forces radio net with at
least two frequencies or the system must allow the Security Forces continuous communications
during radio net saturation, jamming or interference conditions.
9.2. Security Forces Radio Net Capabilities. Units must make the best possible use of
systems that provide secure voice capabilities or comply with Data Encryption Standards (DES).
As existing non-DES systems reach the end of their life cycles, units must incorporate DES into
replacement systems. Provide land-mobile radios, base stations and repeaters with an
uninterruptible power source.
9.3. Frequency Requirements. Units must assign and issue radio frequency authorizations
according to AF frequency authorization directives. See AFIs 33-106, Managing High
Frequency Radios, Personal Wireless Communication Systems and the Military Affiliate Radio
System and 33-118, Electromagnetic Spectrum Management, for complete requirements.
9.4. Types of Radios. Intra-base radio systems include the following components:
   9.4.1. Base Stations. Fixed two-way radios, usually located in control centers.
   9.4.2. Base Station Remotes. Fixed two-way radios installed on fixed posts. Remotes are
   basically amplifiers connected to the base station with telephone lines and use the base
   station to send and receive calls.
   9.4.3. Mobile Two-Way Radios. Usually installed in Security Forces vehicles. These radios
   can communicate over great distances in dispersed situations. Some models can be easily
   removed from vehicles, making them mobile-portable radios.
   9.4.4. Portable Radios. Two-way radios, used on walking patrols, SRTs, security patrols and
   fixed posts. These radios can communicate over short distances and are used for most
   normal day-to-day operations.
9.5. Radio Equipment Distribution. Provide radios to Security Forces as follows:
   9.5.1. Give each static Security Forces member a portable or fixed two-way radio.
   9.5.2. Give FTs two two-way radios, one per two people.
   9.5.3. Equip Security Forces vehicles with mobile or portable two-way radios.
   9.5.4. Install direct or hot line instruments at each permanent static post.
   9.5.5. Installations with protection level resources must back up the LMR system with a
   land-line system.
   9.5.6. Ensure units devise manual systems at each installation with protection level resources
   to back up the Land Mobile Radio (LMR) and landline systems.
AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010                                                         91


9.6. Backup Systems. Radio systems can be supported with the following:
   9.6.1. The first backup system is comprised of installation telephone services and field
   systems. The telephone service provides lines for calling on and off the installation,
   connection of special (hot) lines, lines for fixed posts, and Defense Switched Network (DSN)
   capability. Field systems are tactical phone systems, normally manually operated and
   providing service to stations connected to the system. See AFH 31-302, Air Base Defense
   Collective Skills, for available field systems.
       9.6.1.1. Cellular telephones are tools that are very useful. DFCs determine who requires
       use of a cellular telephone.
   9.6.2. The second backup system is comprised of manual signal techniques. These signals
   can be established and implemented at MAJCOM, installation and unit level. These signals
   include hand and arm signals, flashlights, flares, smoke grenades, whistle, and weapon as a
   last resort. NOTE: If weapons are used, they will be pointed in a safe direction so projectiles
   will not jeopardize human life or damage resources.
9.7. Communication Systems. The Security Forces communications system is a critical part of
flight enforcement operations. Through this system, transmit voice reports to the security control
point where enforcement operations are managed. Timely reporting enables prompt reaction to
threatening events. Key components of Security Forces communications include:
   9.7.1. Telephone (base and cellular [if in a vehicle ensure you are using a handsfree device]).
       9.7.1.1. Security Forces commanders publish policies concerning use of cellular
       telephones
   9.7.2. Secure phones.
   9.7.3. Pagers.
   9.7.4. Various radio nets with associated repeaters and trunking systems.
   9.7.5. Computer access to the National Crime Information Center (NCIC).
   9.7.6. Alarm systems.
   9.7.7. 911 emergency telephone systems.
   9.7.8. Hotlines.
   9.7.9. Three rounds fired in rapid succession or host nations requirements
9.8. Radio Procedures. Practice improves message transmission and reception. Security
Forces members must ensure they understand local radio transmission procedures. Proper use of
these procedures will ensure the radio net works well under both normal and emergency
conditions.
   9.8.1. Call Signs. Each post/patrol with a radio is assigned a combination of words and
   phonetics (letters and/or numbers) used to identify the post/patrol. These call signs simplify,
   clarify, and make communications more protected (preclude disclosing individual’s name).
   When contacting another post/patrol, the calling station first identifies the station being
   called, followed by their call sign, for example, “Police One, this is control”. In this example
   the Security Forces control center (Control) is calling Police One (a patrol).
 92                                    AFMAN31-201V3_AETCSUP_I 2 NOVEMBER 2010


   9.8.2. Procedure words (Pro-words) are used in radio/telephone communications to shorten
   transmissions and facilitate message reception (see Attachment 3).
   9.8.3. Clear speech. Security Forces who use the radio should use clear speech procedures.
   Keep the message short and use as few words as possible. EXAMPLE: Base Police: “Police
   One, this is Base Police”. Police One: “Base Police, Police One, at the library, all secure”.
   Base Police: “Police One, contact Airman Jones at Dormitory 431, Room 27, reference theft,
   acknowledge”. Police One: “Base Police, I copy Airman Jones, Dorm 431, Room 27,
   reference theft. Police One, out”.
   9.8.4. Use the phonetic alphabet when accurate communication is critical. Speech
   transmitting techniques used in radio/telephone communications are extremely important.
   Transmit words that are normally difficult to understand in radio/telephone communication,
   abbreviations and groups of letters using the phonetic alphabet. (see Attachment 2).
9.8.5. Duress signals or words, often referred to as codes, are designed for transmission in a
manner that is not noticed by an untrained person, but alerts a Security Forces member receiving
the signal. Use locally developed duress codes for emergency or distress situations.
9.9. Prohibited Radio Practices. When using the radio, Security Forces should know Federal
Communications Commission prohibited practices:
   9.9.1. Use of profane or obscene language.
   9.9.2. Transmission of unnecessary, extravagant, false or deceptive signals.
   9.9.3. Transmissions not in accordance with the limitations of a station license or by an
   unlicensed station. For example, the license granted to Security Forces limits range to 150
   miles and does not allow for transmitting music or commercial radio signals.
9.10. Interference. Interference is natural or man-made radiation of electrical energy that
causes difficulty in reception of signals. Electrical devices such as vehicle ignition systems,
sparking brushes on motors or generators and similar kinds of machines that generate an
electromagnetic field are examples of man-made interference. Natural source interference
occurs in four classifications:
   9.10.1. Atmospheric interference from electrical storms.
   9.10.2. Solar and cosmic interference from eruptions on the sun and other stars.
   9.10.3. Static from charged precipitation particles in the atmosphere.
   9.10.4. Propagation fading from disturbances in the medium through which radio waves
   pass.
9.11. Jamming. Jamming is deliberate interference intended to prevent reception of signals in a
specific frequency band. Transmitting radio waves that obscure or obliterate information
normally received by electronic communications devices constitutes jamming. Jamming disrupts
radio communications and may surprise, confuse and/or mislead radio operators. There are two
basic types of radio jamming:
   9.11.1. Spot jamming is the transmission of a narrow-band signal to interfere with a specific
   frequency or channel.

   9.11.2. Barrage jamming is the transmission of a wide-band signal to interfere with as many
   channels as possible.
9.12. Reports. Report all jamming and interference to the local communications squadron.

   terror or crime that occur along waterfront areas.
   A34.1.2. (Added-AETC) Ensure at least two people perform the boat patrol detail, at least
   one of whom is an SF member.
   A34.1.3. (Added-AETC) SF members who ride along with a U.S. Coast Guard,
   Department of Fish and Game, Maritime Patrol or local sheriff’s department boat patrol will
   act as observers only. SF personnel will not enforce maritime laws or get involved in
   situations that are not directly related to installation force protection.
   A34.1.4. (Added-AETC) According to AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations, locally procured
   boats will not exceed 32 feet in length. Boats longer than 32 feet must be approved by HQ
   AETC/A4R. Submit an AF IMT 601, Equipment Action Request, as directed by AFI 24-301,
   Chapter 5.
A34.2. (Added-AETC) Coordination:
   A34.2.1. (Added-AETC) Each unit will establish a unit operating instruction covering the
   requirements for certification, training, operating environments, restrictions and equipment
   requirements.
   A34.2.2. (Added-AETC) Establish clear jurisdiction and rules of engagement regarding the
   use of force. Note: SF personnel on boat patrol will be armed only for self-defense/defense
   of others.
   A34.2.3. (Added-AETC) Operating procedures must include guidance covering all local
   laws and regulations that are enforced by any state or federal agency with jurisdiction over
   the area.
   A34.2.4. (Added-AETC) Maintain documented agreements (i.e. MOA, Memorandum of
   Understanding) with all appropriate maritime law enforcement agencies operating in the
   same area, such as the U.S. Coast Guard, Department of Fish and Game, or local sheriff’s
   department.
   A34.2.5. (Added-AETC) Ensure the installation staff judge advocate reviews and concurs
   with established procedures.
A34.3. (Added-AETC) Training:
   A34.3.1. (Added-AETC) The boat operator must complete a state or nationally certified
   boating safety course with a focus on safety, operational checks, and water hazards.
   A34.3.2. (Added-AETC) The course must also include boat-handling operations, and
   towing and launching safety procedures (if the boat will be stored on land).
   A34.3.3. (Added-AETC) Units should also take advantage of additional training
   opportunities through local law enforcement agencies.

  Code of Federal Regulations, and equipment required by the state in which the boat is
  operated. Boats should also be equipped with emergency signaling devices such as flashing
  lights, sirens and a public address system.
  A34.4.2. (Added-AETC) Personnel aboard any watercraft being towed by SF boat patrols
  are considered occupants of the boat and must wear an approved life jacket.
A34.5. (Added-AETC) Weapon Safety:
  A34.5.1. (Added-AETC) The M-4, if carried, will be slung over the back or secured in a
  fixed weapons rack mounted to the boat, which is the preferred method due to safety
  concerns. Units must coordinate with the base safety office to determine if carrying the M-4
  is feasible.
  A34.5.2. (Added-AETC) The M-9, if carried, will be securely fastened in an approved
  holster.
