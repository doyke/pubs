                UNIT STAN/EVAL FUNCTIONS AND ORGANIZATION

3.1. Scope. For purpose of this instruction, "unit" includes levels of organization under HHQ
required to establish a stan/eval function. Most units are composed of an Operations Group (OG)
and cyber squadrons/detachments (henceforth in this AFI, “Operations Group” will be
considered any Group-level command, and "squadron" will be used synonymously with
"detachment"). Where there is no parent OG, squadrons will assume duties listed for OGs.
3.2. Operations Group Commander (OG/CC). When circumstances prohibit the OG/CC
from executing these responsibilities, a squadron/detachment commander (Sq/Det/CC) may
assume responsibility for the following functions. This requires a written waiver by the
MAJCOM/A3 (T-2). The OG/CC:
   3.2.1. Directs the conduct of the unit level stan/eval program (T-3).
   3.2.2. Provides manpower to the unit stan/eval function to execute the duties directed by this
   AFI (T-3).
   3.2.3. Designates OGV stan/eval examiners (SEE) (see section 4.2) (T-3).
   3.2.4. Designates additional cybercrew examiners who are not assigned to OGV, when
   necessary, to meet unique unit requirements. Document in the SEB minutes (see Attachment
   4) (T-3).
   3.2.5. Designates, when necessary, stan/eval liaison officers (SELOs) to assist OGV in
   administrative duties (T-3).
   3.2.6. Chairs the SEB (T-3).
   3.2.7. Establishes procedures to implement MAJCOM-mandated stan/eval software, as
   required (T-3).
   3.2.8. Provides waiver authority for weapon system cybercrew examiners to evaluate
   mission/skill sets in which they are not certified (T-3).
3.3. Stan/Eval Organization. The stan/eval function will normally be administered from the
group level (OGV) with the Chief of Stan/Eval reporting directly to the OG/CC. However, when
circumstances prohibit, or if directed by the OG/CC, the Squadron/Detachment may assume
responsibility for this function. This transfer of responsibility will be reserved for units not
collocated with the Group (T-3). The stan/eval function:
   3.3.1. Consists of a Chief of Stan/Eval and at least one examiner per cybercrew position per
   CWS.
       3.3.1.1. The OG/CC may determine if a specific examiner is not required based on unit
       requirements or personnel constraints. This will be indicated in the SEB minutes.
       3.3.1.2. The Chief of Stan/Eval will be a certified examiner in a unit CWS (T-3) and
       report directly to, and be rated by, the OG/CC (or Sq/Det/CC when the function resides
       below group) (T-3).
AFI10-1703V2 15 OCTOBER 2014                                                                  11


      3.3.1.3. Select examiners from the most suitable, highest qualified and most experienced
      personnel (T-3).
   3.3.2. Processes AF Form 4418, Certificate of Cybercrew/Spacecrew Qualification and AF
   Form 4420, Individual’s Record of Duties and Qualifications (T-3).
   3.3.3. Establishes, monitors, and maintains the unit Individual Qualification Folders (IQF)
   program IAW Chapter 8 (T-3).
   3.3.4. Establishes procedures for review and quality control of evaluation documentation (T-
   3).
   3.3.5. Establishes and maintains a trend analysis program IAW Chapter 9 (T-3).
   3.3.6. Conducts SEBs IAW Chapter 9 and ensures SEB minutes are distributed within 15
   calendar days (T-3). OG/CC will determine distribution, which will at a minimum include
   the NAF stan/eval function.
   3.3.7. Establishes unit no-notice program and goals. (T-3) Monitors this program to ensure
   goals set by the OG/CC or SQ/CC are met and unit no-notice evaluations are distributed
   proportionately among positions and types of evaluations (T-3).
   3.3.8. Designs evaluation criteria and submits to NAF for review and approval IAW
   Attachment 3 (T-3). Evaluation criteria require NAF approval prior to implementation.
   3.3.9. Designs Master Question Files (MQFs) for all CWSs assigned to the group and
   submits to NAF for review and approval IAW Attachment 2 (T-3). MQFs require NAF
   approval prior to implementation.
   3.3.10. Develops and documents the SEE training program (T-3), designed to instruct and
   certify SEEs on the proper manner in which to correctly assess cybercrew proficiency as part
   of their role in the Instructional Systems Development (ISD) process. SEE training programs
   must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate NAF stan/eval prior to implementation
   and meet the requirements of Chapter 4 (T-3).
   3.3.11. Monitors the upgrade and objectivity of all SEEs (T-3).
   3.3.12. At least quarterly, advises unit leadership on unit cybercrew qualification status,
   requisite completion, and upcoming expiration dates (T-3). In addition, at least semi-annually
   advises unit leadership on unit trends as well as combined trends across all units under the
   stan/eval office’s responsibility. (T-3)
3.4. Squadron Commander. Supports the group stan/eval program and encourages a positive
climate conducive to successful implementation of the Cybercrew Standardization and
Evaluation Program.

                               CYBERCREW EXAMINERS

4.1. General. The evaluation portion of the Cybercrew Stan/Eval Program is administered by
SEEs at both the group and squadron levels. An examiner who is qualified on more than one
CWS may evaluate more than one position.
4.2. SEEs:
   4.2.1. Will complete appropriate training program documented on AF Form 4420 before
   certification (T-3). A certified SEE conducting the SEE training on another individual does
   not need to be appointed as an instructor. Evaluator trainees will be observed and supervised
   by a certified SEE (T-3). At a minimum the training will consist of: (T-3)
      4.2.1.1. Applicable equipment configuration and scheduling procedures (e.g., simulator
      and on-line equipment configuration, test and evaluation scenario control procedures).
      4.2.1.2. ISD process and procedures.
      4.2.1.3. Construction, conduct, and administration of the written phase of an evaluation.
      4.2.1.4. Construction, conduct, and administration of the performance phase of an
      evaluation.
      4.2.1.5. Observance, at a minimum, of one certified SEE conducting an evaluation.
   4.2.2. Conduct cybercrew evaluations IAW with this instruction. (T-3)
   4.2.3. Maintain MR/CMR status in each position that they will evaluate (T-3). NAF-level
   examiners will only be required to maintain basic mission capable (BMC) status per the
   requirements in AFI 10-1703, Volume 1, Cybercrew Training. (T-3)
   4.2.4. Administer evaluations only in those positions in which they maintain qualification
   and certification. (T-3) Exception: spot qualification (SPOT) evaluations and where
   specifically authorized in applicable MAJCOM guidance.
   4.2.5. Will not administer evaluations outside of their MAJCOM unless specifically
   requested by the MAJCOM stan/eval organization of the examinee and approved by the
   MAJCOM stan/eval organization of the examiner (T-2). MAJCOMs may establish
   procedures in their supplement for CWS cybercrew examiners to administer evaluations
   outside of NAFs/units within their own MAJCOM (see also paragraph 2.3.4).
   4.2.6. Pass an objectivity evaluation administered by the Chief of Stan/Eval or designee
   based on the NAF approved SEE training and certification program. Objectivity evaluations
   can be administered by HHQ personnel IAW paragraph 2.4.2.5.
   4.2.7. Conduct a thorough pre-evaluation briefing and post-evaluation debriefing for the
   examinee and applicable cybercrew members on all aspects of the evaluation.
   4.2.8. Debrief the examinee’s flight commander or operations officer on the results of the
   evaluation. As soon as possible, notify the examinee’s squadron commander (or available
   supervision if the squadron commander cannot be reached) whenever Qualification Level 2
   or 3 (Q2 or Q3) performance is observed (see paragraph 5.4).

                   CYBERCREW QUALIFICATION EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The Cybercrew Stan/Eval Program utilizes cybercrew evaluations to ensure
qualification of cybercrew members and standardization of operations.
5.2. Categories. Cybercrew qualification evaluations are divided into three categories,
(Qualification (QUAL), Mission (MSN), and SPOT), each consisting of two structured phases,
written and performance. (Exception: A SPOT evaluation may only consist of one phase,
depending on its purpose.)
   5.2.1. QUAL Evaluations.
      5.2.1.1. Purpose. Ensure basic qualification in a CWS and/or cybercrew position.
      5.2.1.2. Execution. All cybercrews will complete periodic QUAL evaluation in their
      primary assigned CWS cybercrew positions in accordance with lead command developed
      criteria described in paragraph 2.3.2.1 of this instruction (T-3). QUAL evaluations may
      be combined with MSN evaluations IAW lead MAJCOM guidance.
   5.2.2. MSN Evaluations.
      5.2.2.1. Purpose. To ensure qualification to employ the CWS at the assigned cybercrew
      position in the accomplishment of the unit’s operational and/or designated operational
      capability (DOC) statement missions.
      5.2.2.2. Execution. All cybercrew members maintaining MR/CMR status (IAW AFI 10-
      1703, Vol 1) will complete a periodic MSN evaluation as specified in the applicable lead
      MAJCOM guidance. (T-3)
          5.2.2.2.1. The MSN evaluation should reflect the type and difficulty of tasks required
          in fulfillment of the CWS operational and/or DOC statement missions.
   5.2.3. SPOT Evaluations.
      5.2.3.1. Purpose. Evaluate a specific event or requirement without intending to satisfy
      the requirements of a periodic evaluation and/or an initial evaluation.
      5.2.3.2. Execution. A SPOT has no specific requisites, unless specified in lead
      MAJCOM guidance, but may be no notice (N/N).
          5.2.3.2.1. An examinee may utilize a SPOT evaluation to update a QUAL/MSN
          evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the QUAL/MSN are met.
          5.2.3.2.2. Any qualifying event and/or evaluation not listed in paragraphs 5.2.1
          through 5.2.3 will be documented as a SPOT evaluation. (T-3)
          5.2.3.2.3. Objectivity evaluations will be documented as a SPOT on the AF Form
          4418. (T-3)
   5.2.4. Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used, when applicable, to further describe the
   evaluations listed in paragraphs 5.2.1 through 5.2.3: (T-3)
 14                                                         AFI10-1703V2 15 OCTOBER 2014


       5.2.4.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type in a specific CWS cybercrew
       position.
       5.2.4.2. Requalification (RQ). An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of
       qualification due to:
           5.2.4.2.1. Expiration of a required periodic evaluation. The recheck will be IAW the
           guidance for that periodic evaluation. (T-3)
           5.2.4.2.2. Loss of currency that requires a requalification evaluation (IAW lead
           MAJCOM guidance). In this case RQ SPOT will be used for documentation (T-3).
           The requalification criteria will be as directed by the certifying official and will
           include, as a minimum, those items for which the individual is non-current. (T-3)
           5.2.4.2.3. A failed periodic evaluation. The requalification criteria will be as directed
           by the certifying official and will include, as a minimum, those items for which the
           individual failed the evaluation. (T-3)
           5.2.4.2.4. Loss of qualification due to a commander-directed downgrade (see
           paragraph 5.10). The recheck criteria will be as directed by the commander on the AF
           Form 4418. (T-3)
           5.2.4.2.5. The RQ prefix will not be used to prefix a requalification following a failed
           INIT evaluation. (T-3) No qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not
           possible.
       5.2.4.3. No-Notice.
           5.2.4.3.1. The N/N evaluation program provides commanders a sampling of daily
           cybercrew performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness.
           5.2.4.3.2. A N/N evaluation is one where the examinee is notified of the evaluation at
           or after the beginning of the cybercrew changeover.
           5.2.4.3.3. A N/N cannot be combined with an INIT evaluation. (T-3)
       5.2.4.4. Simulator (SIM). An evaluation where the performance phase requisite is
       conducted in a simulator as defined in lead MAJCOM guidance.
       5.2.4.5. Multiple Prefixes. More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation.
       The applicability of any prefixes to portions of any combined evaluations and the purpose
       for any prefixes (if not obvious by the context of the evaluation) will be explained on the
       AF Form 4418 IAW Chapter 8. (T-3)
5.3. Phases. QUAL and MSN evaluations consist of two structured phases, written and
performance. The written is considered a pre-requisite and must be passed prior to beginning the
performance phase. (T-3) SPOT evaluations may consist of one or both phases depending on
their purpose.
5.4. Qualification Levels. Qualification levels are grades assigned to the overall evaluation.
Individual phases are graded IAW Chapters 6 and 7 and are considered when determining the
overall qualification level. Qualification levels are:
   5.4.1. Qualification Level 1 (Q1). The member demonstrated desired performance and
   knowledge of safety, procedures, equipment and directives within tolerances specified in the
AFI10-1703V2 15 OCTOBER 2014                                                                  15


   grading criteria. This is awarded when no discrepancies were noted, and may be awarded
   when discrepancies are noted if:
       5.4.1.1. The discrepancies resulted in no unsatisfactory (U) grades being given in any
       area(s)/subarea(s).
       5.4.1.2. All discrepancies noted during the evaluation were resolved during the debrief of
       that evaluation.
       5.4.1.3. Passed written exam with score of 90-100 on first attempt.
   5.4.2. Qualification Level 2 (Q2). The member generally demonstrated desired performance
   and knowledge of safety, procedures, equipment and directives within tolerances specified in
   the grading criteria, but:
       5.4.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training was
       assigned.
       5.4.2.2. A non-critical area/subarea grade of U was awarded.
       5.4.2.3. Passed written exam with score of 80 to <90 on first attempt.
   5.4.3. Qualification Level 3 (Q3). The member demonstrated an unacceptable level of safety,
   performance or knowledge. The member is not qualified to perform cybercrew duties.
       5.4.3.1. An area grade of U awarded in a critical area requires an overall Q3 for the
       evaluation.
       5.4.3.2. Failed written exam with a score of <80.
       5.4.3.3. Reference paragraph 7.7 for retest scoring information.
   5.4.4. Exceptionally Qualified (EQ) Designation (Optional). An EQ designation may be
   awarded by the examiner when:
       5.4.4.1. The examinee has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in all portions
       of the evaluation.
       5.4.4.2. The examinee has not failed any part and;
       5.4.4.3. The examinee received a Q1 grade with no discrepancies on all areas/subareas.
       5.4.4.4. The operator passed written exam with a score of 95-100.
5.5. Evaluation Criteria. Evaluation criteria define the performance standards expected of
cybercrews in their accomplishment of the mission. These standards are the measurement against
which crewmembers are evaluated to achieve and maintain their qualifications. Evaluation
criteria in lead MAJCOM-provided guidance will contain areas/subareas required for evaluation
completion (T-3). Attachment 3 gives examples for evaluation criteria.
5.6. Requisites. Requisites are defined as that combination of written examinations,
performance examinations, and other requirements as directed by the appropriate lead
MAJCOM-provided guidance before an evaluation is considered complete.
   5.6.1. Lead MAJCOM-provided guidance will specify requisites for each cybercrew position
   and associated qualifications (T-2).
 16                                                         AFI10-1703V2 15 OCTOBER 2014


   5.6.2. Units that direct additional requisites beyond those specified in the appropriate lead
   MAJCOM-provided guidance must document these within their unit instructions (T-3).
   5.6.3. For multiple qualifications, the evaluation of one requisite may count for separate
   evaluations provided the evaluations occur IAW the provisions of section 5.7.
   5.6.4. Requisites that were valid for a failed examination remain valid.
5.7. Timing of Qualification Evaluations.
   5.7.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations are defined in the respective lead
   MAJCOM-provided guidance but will not exceed the last day of the 17th month after the
   evaluation was successfully completed (T-3).
   5.7.2. Requirements before Permanent Change of Station (PCS)/Temporary Duty (TDY). If
   a periodic evaluation will expire within three months after the proposed departure for a PCS
   to an assignment in the same mission type, or during an upcoming TDY, complete the
   required evaluation(s) before departing for either the PCS assignment or the TDY.
5.8. Failure to Pass a Positional Evaluation.
   5.8.1. Requalification. If a member fails a positional evaluation, a successful RQ must be
   completed within 30 calendar days after the date of the first failure (e.g., for an evaluation on
   20 June, complete the recheck by 19 July) (T-3). For Air Reserve Component (ARC) units, a
   successful RQ must be completed within 90 calendar days after the date of the first failure
   (T-3).
   5.8.2. Restrictions. When called for by this instruction or deemed necessary in the judgment
   of the SEE, the SEE may recommend restrictions be imposed on the examinee until
   successful completion of assigned additional training and/or a recheck. The certifying
   official, or designated representative, makes the final determination.
       5.8.2.1. Restrictions should address the specific phase of operation that requires
       supervision and the criteria for removal of the restrictions.
       5.8.2.2. QUAL Evaluation: Place the examinee on supervised status (see paragraph
       5.8.4) on the system in which the evaluation was administered. For specialized and/or
       multiple qualified cybercrew maintaining qualification for similar duty in multiple
       CWSs, lead MAJCOM-provided guidance may direct supervised status on all systems in
       which the individual maintains qualification.
       5.8.2.3. MSN Evaluation: Place the examinee on supervised status (see paragraph 5.8.4)
       on the system in which the evaluation was administered.
   5.8.3. Status Downgrade. Cybercrew members receiving a Q3 QUAL and/or MSN
   evaluation are non-mission ready (N-MR)/non-combat mission ready (N-CMR) IAW lead
   MAJCOM-provided guidance. Place cybercrew members receiving a failing score on a
   QUAL on supervised status.
   5.8.4. Supervised Status.
       5.8.4.1. If unsatisfactory performance or restrictions require an examinee be placed on
       supervised status, the type of supervisor (i.e., instructor or designated supervisor) will be
AFI10-1703V2 15 OCTOBER 2014                                                                  17


       determined by the squadron commander and/or as specified in lead MAJCOM-provided
       guidance (T-3).
       5.8.4.2. The certifying official determines the restrictions to be imposed on the member.
5.9. Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period.
   5.9.1. If a member fails to complete an evaluation within the period listed in paragraph 5.7,
   the member loses the qualification covered by the evaluation and the restrictions of
   paragraph 5.8 apply.
   5.9.2. Qualification may be re-established by administering a requalification evaluation or
   by completion of the delinquent evaluation. OG/CC or designee may approve waivers to
   preclude the re-accomplishment of completed requisites to complete the evaluation on a case-
   by-case basis.
5.10. Commander-Directed Downgrade. The certifying official may direct a downgrade (Q-
/U) in a specific area/sub-area without disqualifying an individual. Additionally, a certifying
official may direct a downgrade that either removes a qualification or completely disqualifies an
individual. Downgrades may be directed without administering an evaluation using the following
guidance:
   5.10.1. For performance-related cases use for cause only (e.g., breach of weapon system
   discipline, safety, etc.). Incidents do not have to be directly observed by an examiner, but
   may be recommended by an examiner from any CWS/cybercrew specialty.
   5.10.2. For non-performance-related cases involving lapses of judgment significant enough
   to cause a commander to lose confidence in the cybercrew member’s ability to safely operate
   the equipment, do not use a downgrade or disqualification as a substitute for or in lieu of
   appropriate progressive disciplinary measures (e.g., Verbal Counseling, Letter of Counseling,
   Letter of Reprimand, Article 15, etc.). Consult with the supporting Staff Judge Advocate
   office for legal advice in these cases. Use in cases where such incidences directly affect the
   commander’s confidence in the cybercrew member’s ability to safely operate the equipment
   (e.g., lapse in judgment significant enough to cast doubt on the cybercrews decision-making
   abilities on the system).
   5.10.3. For downgrades that either remove qualifications or completely disqualify an
   individual, the affected cybercrew will cease acting in the qualification(s) from which they
   have been downgraded effective with the date the commander initiated the downgrade. (T-3)
   5.10.4. Document commander-directed downgrades IAW paragraph 8.3.2. (T-3)
5.11. Multiple Qualifications. Evaluations in multiple cybercrew positions will be addressed in
lead MAJCOM-provided guidance.
   5.11.1. Documentation. MAJCOMs may authorize certification in more than one CWS for
   crewmembers only when such action is directed by command mission requirements and is
   economically justifiable. This authority cannot be delegated below the MAJCOM level,
   except for the lead MAJCOM, which may further delegate within its command, but not lower
   than wing commander. Document MAJCOM authority for multiple qualifications in the IQF.
   5.11.2. QUAL Evaluations. All members require a QUAL evaluation in each position (T-2).

            CYBERCREW PERFORMANCE EXAMINATION PROGRAM

6.1. Purpose. The performance program measures the skills and abilities of a crewmember
through observation of their performance in a specific cybercrew position.
6.2. General.
   6.2.1. Performance examination management. Unit stan/eval will develop and maintain
   standard performance examination scenarios for each position IAW Attachment 5. (T-3)
   6.2.2. Performance examination scenario reviews. Unit stan/eval will review all steps of the
   performance evaluations for accuracy, feasibility, and correct process steps semi-annually.
   (T-3)
6.3. Grading System.
   6.3.1. A two-step grading system is used to evaluate and document crewmember
   performance.
      6.3.1.1. In the first step, individual grades are assigned against each area and subarea of
      the evaluation criteria established for the appropriate cybercrew position.
      6.3.1.2. In the second step, an overall qualification level is assigned based on a
      compilation of all individual area/subarea grades IAW Chapter 5.
   6.3.2. Performance Areas/Subareas.
      6.3.2.1. Areas/subareas will have a two-tier (Q/U) grading system for critical
      areas/subareas or three-tier (Q/Q-/U) grading system for non-critical areas/subareas in
      accordance with the appropriate lead MAJCOM guidance. (T-3) Discrepancies will be
      documented against the established areas/subareas. (T-3)
          6.3.2.1.1. Q indicates the examinee demonstrated both a satisfactory knowledge of
          all required information and performed cybercrew duties within the prescribed
          tolerances.
          6.3.2.1.2. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area/subarea
          tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the SEE.
          Deviations must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances, jeopardize safety, or be a
          breach of CWS discipline. (T-3)
          6.3.2.1.3. U indicates that performance was outside allowable parameters, thereby
          compromising safety; that deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances adversely
          affected mission accomplishment; and/or that evaluated performance constituted a
          breach of CWS discipline.
6.4. Conduct of a Performance Evaluation.
   6.4.1. The examiner will grade the areas/subareas listed as required within NAF-approved
   evaluation criteria. (T-3)
   6.4.2. In addition to required areas/subareas, the examiner will grade any area/subarea
   observed during an evaluation that was incidental to the task(s) being performed and the
 20                                                       AFI10-1703V2 15 OCTOBER 2014


   examiner observed less than acceptable performance which could adversely impact
   operations or overall safety. (T-3)
   6.4.3. Minor momentary deviations are acceptable, provided the examinee applies prompt
   corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize safety. Consider cumulative
   deviations when determining the overall area/subarea grade.
6.5. Remedial Action. An examinee receiving an area/subarea grade of Q- or U requires
debriefing and/or additional training, as determined by the SEE.
   6.5.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Examiners will explain the discrepancy to ensure that the
   examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or proficiency. (T-3)
   6.5.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by the examiner to remedy
   deficiencies identified during an evaluation.
      6.5.2.1. May include self-study, use of a simulator, supervised operations on the “live”
      network, or operations in a range environment.
      6.5.2.2. Will be complete 30 days following the date of the discrepancy. For ARC units,
      will be complete within 90 calendar days after the date of the discrepancy. (T-3)
      6.5.2.3. If a cybercrew member exceeds the allotted time for completion of additional
      training, the certifying official will review the situation and direct appropriate action.
      Document the circumstances on the AF Form 4420. (T-3)
      6.5.2.4. Document additional training on the AF Form 4418.
      6.5.2.5. Requires a SPOT evaluation of the area(s)/subarea(s) in which additional
      training was prescribed within 30 days of additional training completion. Document
      SPOT evaluation on a separate AF Form 4418.
6.6. Supervised Status Requirement. Place personnel who fail performance examination in
supervised status until successful retesting is completed.
6.7. Re-Evaluation.
   6.7.1. Unit stan/eval will administer an alternate examination upon completion of retraining,
   but no later than the last day of the first month following the date of the discrepancy. (T-3)
   Unit stan/eval will make every reasonable effort to accomplish re-testing prior to the end of
   the crewmember’s eligibility window. (T-3) ARC units will administer an alternate
   examination within 90 calendar days after the date of the first failure. (T-3)
   6.7.2. The authority to extend the time allowed to successfully complete the examination is
   the OG/CC.
AFI10-1703V2 15 OCTOBER 2014                                                                 21

                CYBERCREW WRITTEN EXAMINATION PROGRAM

7.1. Purpose. The examination program measures knowledge, procedures, and other
information for effective operations through the administration of written, computer-based, or
electronic examinations. Poor testing performance on examinations indicates areas requiring
increased training emphasis.
7.2. General.
   7.2.1. Examination Management. Unit stan/eval will develop and maintain a minimum of
   two different examinations for each position, or generate a unique test for each person
   requiring an exam. (T-3)
       7.2.1.1. A closed-book exam is required as a prerequisite to a QUAL or MSN evaluation.
       An open book exam may also be administered as a prerequisite to a QUAL or MSN
       evaluation in conjunction with the closed-book exam. If both an open- and a closed-book
       exam are administered, the scores are considered separately when determining the overall
       qualification level. For example, if the examinee fails the closed-book exam on the first
       attempt, but scores 100% on the open-book, upon passing the closed-book exam the
       highest overall rating allowed is Q-2.
       7.2.1.2. Unit stan/eval will change a minimum of 25 percent of the questions on each
       examination every calendar year. (T-3)
   7.2.2. Examination Reviews. Unit stan/eval will review all MQFs and prepared exams for
   accuracy annually and after any changes in source documents. (T-3) If a complete review
   was accomplished due to a source document change, it may be annotated as the annual
   review.
   7.2.3. Examination Security. Unit stan/eval will maintain positive control of all exams,
   applicable answer sheets, and associated computer-based/electronic media. (T-3)
   7.2.4. Examination Question Sources.
       7.2.4.1. Open Book Exams (Optional). Open book exams will be derived from technical
       orders, manuals, handbooks, or instructions that may not require immediate recall or are
       not regularly referenced. (T-3) Questions will come from publications containing
       information pertinent to the operation and performance of the assigned mission. (T-3)
       7.2.4.2. Closed Book Exams (Required). Closed book exam questions will come from
       MQFs. (T-3) These questions will emphasize system knowledge, time-sensitive
       information, and information required to be immediately recalled for quick responses. (T-
       3)
   7.2.5. End-of-Course Examinations. Formal training units (FTU) administering USAF
   formal school courses listed in the Air Force Education and Training Course Announcement
   (ETCA) database (https://etca.randolph.af.mil/) may use end-of-course (EOC)
   examinations to fulfill the requirements of the open book and closed book requisite
   examinations.
 22                                                        AFI10-1703V2 15 OCTOBER 2014


       7.2.5.1. The MAJCOM stan/eval responsible for the USAF formal training will
       coordinate with AF/A6CF to ensure the EOC examination meets the requirements of this
       instruction and applicable instructional supplements before awarding credit for requisite
       completion. (T-2)
       7.2.5.2. EOC examination test questions do not need to incorporate NAF-approved
       MQFs; however, all questions must reflect the latest changes to all systems and/or
       operational procedures and not conflict with any MQFs.
       7.2.5.3. All EOC examinations that fulfill the requirements of requisite examinations will
       be graded according to this AFI and appropriate lead MAJCOM guidance, and entered on
       the stan/eval qualification documentation. (T-3)
7.3. Grading System.
   7.3.1. The total number of questions on a written exam should be determined by the total
   number of areas graded within the appropriate lead MAJCOM guidance. The minimum
   passing grade for all stan/eval examinations is 80 percent.
7.4. Conduct of Written Examinations.
   7.4.1. For open book exams, examiners will make available to examinees all source
   publications used to generate the exam. (T-3)
   7.4.2. Unit stan/eval will leverage computer-based or electronic examinations when feasible.
   (T-3)
   7.4.3. Unit stan/eval will retain graded exam answer sheets/computer records until the
   stan/eval qualification documentation is completed. (T-3)
7.5. Remedial Action. An examinee receiving a failing grade on a written examination requires
debriefing and additional training (as determined by the SEE) and a retest. Notify the examinee’s
supervisor of the exam failure immediately.
   7.5.1. The examiner will provide instruction concerning the missed test questions to ensure
   the examinee understands the areas/subareas that must be addressed. (T-3)
   7.5.2. Remedial Training. Remedial training will be completed by the examinee with the
   assistance of an instructor, as needed, and may include self-study, use of a simulator,
   supervised operations on the “live” network, or operations in a range environment. (T-3)
       7.5.2.1. Will be complete by the last day of the first month following the date of the
       discrepancy (e.g., for an evaluation on 21 February, remedial training must be
       accomplished by 31 March). (T-3) For ARC units, will be complete within 90 calendar
       days after the date of the discrepancy. (T-3)
       7.5.2.2. If a cybercrew member exceeds the allotted time for completion of remedial
       training, the certifying official will review the situation and direct appropriate action.
       Document the circumstances with a memorandum for record (MFR) to be included with
       the AF Form 4418. (T-3)
       7.5.2.3. Document additional training on the AF Form 4418.
AFI10-1703V2 15 OCTOBER 2014                                                                   23


   7.5.3. In the event of a second failure on an exam, notify the certifying official, who will
   direct required actions to be taken. (T-3) Further examinations will not be administered until
   directed by the certifying official. (T-3)
7.6. Supervised Status Requirement. Place personnel who fail a requisite open book or closed
book examination in supervised status until successful retesting is completed. (T-3) For
personnel who maintain multiple qualifications, supervised status resulting from failure of either
an open or closed book examination applies only to the position for which the examination was
administered.
7.7. Retest.
   7.7.1. Unit stan/eval will administer an alternate exam upon completion of retraining, but no
   later than the last day of the first month following the date of the failure. (T-3) For ARC
   units, will administer an alternate examination within 90 calendar days after the date of the
   first failure. (T-3)
   7.7.2. The authority to extend the time allowed to successfully complete the examination is
   the OG/CC. However, if the eligibility window falls within 30 days, every effort must be
   made to re-examine prior to expiration. (T-3)
   7.7.3. A person failing a written examination must be afforded an adequate study period
   prior to re-examination. (T-3)
   7.7.4. A person failing a written examination may not receive an overall qualification rating
   greater than Q2 after passing the retest.

                                          Chapter 8

                                    DOCUMENTATION

8.1. Scope. Administration of the Qualification Evaluation Program requires accurate and
standardized documentation. The qualifications and authorizations for which a person is to be
evaluated are determined from the unit certification document. The results of evaluations are
recorded on AF Form 4418, which certifies the member’s qualification.
   8.1.1. Record the results of cybercrew evaluations on AF Form 4418. Record the
   chronological history of evaluations for a member on AF Form 4420. Maintain these forms
   in the IQF. (T-3)
   8.1.2. The use of electronic forms is authorized, to include use of electronic signatures and
   wholly electronic IQFs IAW lead MAJCOM guidance. In all instances, computer-generated
   forms must include the same information/data as AF Forms as published on the USAF E-
   Publishing web site. (T-3)
8.2. Electronic Database. Units are highly encouraged to use electronic database files for
record keeping, trend analysis, printing of standard forms, etc. The lead MAJCOM will establish
standards for archiving and assessment of electronic files. (T-2) Units not using an electronic
database will maintain hard-copy records as directed in this instruction. (T-3)
8.3. AF Form 4418, Certificate of Cybercrew/Spacecrew Qualification.
   8.3.1. Purpose. Use the AF Form 4418 as the source document to record and verify the
   qualification of a cybercrew member on a CWS.
   8.3.2. Completion of an AF Form 4418 is accomplished by three individuals; the examiner, a
   final approving officer, and the examinee. Exception: for an AF Form 4418 which documents
   a Commander-Directed Downgrade, only the commander, as the final approving authority,
   and the individual affected sign the form.
   8.3.3. Use a separate AF Form 4418 for all positional phase rechecks. (T-3)
8.4. AF Form 4420, Individual’s Record of Duties and Qualification. The AF Form 4420 is
an index providing pertinent information extracted from all the AF Forms 4418 accomplished for
the member. A computer generated AF Form 4420 may be used as long as cumulative entries are
retained.
8.5. Individual Qualification Folder (IQF). The IQF contains the source documents that
constitute the history of certification for each member. The AF Form 4418 is the source
document used to record certification of a member. A complete history of the AF Forms 4418 in
an IQF is maintained on an accompanying AF Form 4420. Software applications capturing the
same information are authorized provided the unit gains approval by the MAJCOM stan/eval
office prior to use.
   8.5.1. Electronic format IQFs are authorized provided proper security measures, backup
   capability, and sustainment plans are in place. If electronic IQFs are used, the Chief of
   Stan/Eval (or equivalent) will publish guidance on storage and layout. (T-3)
AFI10-1703V2 15 OCTOBER 2014                                                                 25


  8.5.2. Maintaining IQF. Each member who is in a MR/CMR position must have an IQF,
  which includes all AF Forms 4418 and AF Forms 4420. (T-3)
     8.5.2.1. The IQF must be maintained by a stan/eval functional office, normally in the
     organization to which the individual is assigned or attached for operational duties. (T-3)
     8.5.2.2. HHQ personnel on active operational status may have their IQFs maintained by
     the stan/eval function at their assigned stations.
     8.5.2.3. The IQF for personnel in inactive operational status will be maintained within a
     collocated stan/eval office. (T-3)
     8.5.2.4. IQF maintenance will be described in a supplement to this instruction. (T-3)
     8.5.2.5. Individuals assigned or attached to other than USAF units may use the format of
     the service to which they are assigned/attached to document their history of qualification/
     certification.
  8.5.3. Contents of IQF. If the IQF is maintained as a hard-copy record, divide it into two
  sections:
     8.5.3.1. Section I (left side). This section contains AF Form 4420.
         8.5.3.1.1. Place AF Forms 4420 on top of Tab 1 in this section in chronological order
         with the most recent on top. (T-3)
         8.5.3.1.2. If used, file electronic storage media in Section I of the IQF. (T-3)
     8.5.3.2. Section II (right side). This section contains AF Forms 4418 and MFRs for all
     evaluations listed on the AF Form 4420 in Section I.
         8.5.3.2.1. File AF Form 4418s in chronological order with the most recent on top.
         (T-3) Individuals who maintain qualification in two or more positions in the same
         CWS will file AF Form 4418s in chronological order, without consideration of CWS
         or position. (T-3)
         8.5.3.2.2. File MFRs documenting waivers and extensions on top of the affected AF
         Form 4418. When action is complete, incorporate the information contained in the
         MFR onto the affected AF Form 4418 under Examiner Remarks paragraph D,
         Additional Comments and remove the MFR from the IQF. (T-3) File permanent
         MFRs documenting major discrepancies relating to qualification immediately above
         the latest affected AF Form 4418. In cases where the MFR is for other items than
         those found on the AF Forms 4418, they are filed in chronological order with AF
         Forms 4418. MFRs become a permanent part of the IQF only when the major
         discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a later Form
         4418.
         8.5.3.2.3. File MFRs documenting major discrepancies of a particular AF Form 4418
         on top of that AF Form 4418 regardless of the date the discrepancy is discovered. (T-
         3)
         8.5.3.2.4. File MFRs documenting similar discrepancies found on multiple AF Form
         4418s on top of the latest affected AF Form 4418. (T-3)
26                                                       AFI10-1703V2 15 OCTOBER 2014


         8.5.3.2.5. Copies of these source documents may be filed with other organizations for
         evaluation program management.
  8.5.4. Review of IQF. Document the procedures on how to accomplish an initial review and
  how to implement the periodic review of IQFs in the supplemental guidance to this
  instruction. (T-3)
     8.5.4.1. Initial Review. The unit will review the IQF for all newly assigned members to
     establish their currency and qualification prior to their first mission. Document this
     review on the AF Form 4420. (T-3) Review previous AF Form 4420 entries to determine
     all applicable qualifications/certifications of the new assigned/attached member. Then,
     document applicable qualifications/certifications accepted by the gaining unit commander
     on a new AF Form 4420 with “Initial Review” signed by the commander as the last entry.
     (T-3)
         8.5.4.1.1. The unit commander is responsible for establishing the currency and
         qualification of the member as determined from the latest applicable documentation
         in sections I and II of the IQF. Following determination of the currency and
         qualification of the member, the unit maintaining the IQF is responsible only for
         documentation subsequently placed in the IQF.
         8.5.4.1.2. If the IQF of HHQ personnel on active operational status is maintained by
         the stan/eval function at their assigned stations, that stan/eval function will also
         review the IQF prior to operations. (T-3)
     8.5.4.2. Posting Review. The stan/eval function will review each AF Form 4418 when it
     is placed in the IQF to ensure accuracy and completeness. This review will confirm that
     the eligibility period and qualification as documented are correct, all required evaluation
     events and requisites were accomplished within the eligibility period, and that the AF
     Form 4418 contains all signatures and initials within allotted time. (T-3)
     8.5.4.3. Periodic Review. The stan/eval function will review all unit IQFs to confirm
     expiration dates used to track required qualification evaluations are the same as those
     listed in the IQFs. (T-3) The interval between reviews will not exceed the qualification
     period window established by paragraph 5.7. (T-3) Document the periodic review IAW
     instructional supplements. Periodic review of IQFs for personnel in inactive status is not
     required.
  8.5.5. IQF Discrepancies. IQF Discrepancies include those on the AF Form 4418s and AF
  Form 4420.
     8.5.5.1. Categories of Discrepancies. Discrepancies are categorized by their impact on
     qualification/certification and are either major or minor.
         8.5.5.1.1. Discrepancies that alter the qualification/certification of the affected
         member are considered major (i.e., expired qualification).
         8.5.5.1.2. Those discrepancies that do not alter the qualification/certification of the
         affected member are considered minor (i.e., typos, formatting, or misspellings).
     8.5.5.2. Disposition of Major Discrepancies. Document major discrepancies on an MFR
     filed in Section II immediately above the affected AF Form 4418. (T-3) Remove MFRs
     created to document late evaluations, Group CC waivers, etc., from the IQF once the
AFI10-1703V2 15 OCTOBER 2014                                                               27


     information is incorporated onto the completed affected AF Form 4418 under examiner
     remarks paragraph D, Additional Comments. MFRs become a permanent part of the IQF
     only when the major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by
     a later AF Form 4418.
     8.5.5.3. Disposition of Minor Discrepancies. Document minor discrepancies on a non-
     permanent record as defined by supplements to this instruction. The record of minor
     discrepancies ensures standardization of AF Forms 4418, AF Form 4420, and member
     IQFs. (T-3)
     8.5.5.4. Corrections.
         8.5.5.4.1. AF Form 4418. Because it is a source document, the AF Form 4418 may
         not be corrected by use of white-out/over-print or pen and ink alteration of the
         original document. (T-3)
         8.5.5.4.2. AF Form 4420. AF Forms 4420, not being source documents, may be
         altered without restriction to reflect the assignment of the affected member and the
         contents of Section II of the IQF.
  8.5.6. Transfer of IQF. The losing unit will coordinate with the member and the gaining unit
  to transfer the IQF (T-3). The IQF may be either hand-carried by the member or, in the case
  of digital or classified files, transmitted electronically or by appropriate secure means.

          specifically addressed above (or in AFI 33-360 and/or TO 00-5-1), units will ensure
          that the information is current and accessible for concurrent viewing by multiple
          cybercrew members. (T-3)
          9.2.2.4.2. At a minimum, units will maintain the required index and location of
          electronic files in a hard-copy binder in the CIF library. (T-3)
          9.2.2.4.3. Documents in the CIF library will be made available for deployments via
          either electronic or hardcopy means. (T-3)
9.3. Stan/Eval Command Interest Items (CII). CIIs are a tool to train members on training
deficiencies, new systems/procedures, or trends.
   9.3.1. CIIs are emphasis items of existing procedures designed to mitigate or eliminate
   specific risks or trends. CIIs do not add to or amend established procedures. CIIs will be
   based on analysis of risks and trends from a variety of sources. (T-3) They may be issued by
   AFSPC, NAF, or units to address incidents, trends, deployed area operations, or potential
   problems with equipment/procedures. Only the issuing organization may rescind the CII.
      9.3.1.1. The Chief of Stan/Eval, at the discretion of the command authority, establishes
      stan/eval CIIs.
      9.3.1.2. CIIs should not be used as a routine message-passing vehicle; they should only
      be used to draw attention to changes or deficiencies in the certification and qualification
      processes.
   9.3.2. When an item is designated for review and evaluation as a stan/eval CII, the stan/eval
   OPR will assign a CII number. The CII number will be based upon the calendar year and
   numbered consecutively (i.e., I-NOSC CII 98-01, 26 NOG CII 99-01, or RAMSTEIN ESU
   CII 00-01). The OPR will then transmit a CII message to all affected subordinate units. (T-3)
   Note: CIIs may be published locally at any unit that maintains a stan/eval function.
   9.3.3. The message that announces a new stan/eval CII will include applicable checklists and
   procedures, an expiration date, and a statement that identifies units and/or positions for which
   the CII is required. (T-3) Publish CII messages and all pertinent information IAW the CEF
   requirements. Once the CII expires, all unit stan/eval functions shall incorporate the CII
   procedures into the permanent program wherever applicable. (T-3)
   9.3.4. Do not establish a CII for a period longer than one year. (T-3)
   9.3.5. Brief all cybercrew positional and Crew Resource Management/Operational Risk
   Management (CRM/ORM) related CIIs during turnover briefings for the duration of the CIIs.
   (T-3) Mission-related CIIs need only be briefed on those missions for which the CII is
   relevant.
   9.3.6. Units will document CIIs in SEB minutes which will be maintained for historical
   purposes. (T-3)

9.4. Go/No-Go Program. The Go/No-Go program ensures individual cybercrew members are
current, qualified, or adequately supervised to perform operations and have reviewed CIF
Volume 1, Part B prior to crew operations/shift change.
   9.4.1. Units will establish a control system to ensure cybercrew members have completed all
   training and stan/eval items required for duty prior to shift turn over. (T-3)
   9.4.2. The unit commander will appoint a scheduler who will ensure Go/No-Go status is
   utilized for scheduling cybercrew members for operations. (T-3)
   9.4.3. The senior controller from the previous day/shift or unit commander’s designated
   representative will certify the oncoming cybercrew prior to conducting operations. (T-3)
   9.4.4. At a minimum, the Go/No-Go monitor will verify the following (T-3):
       9.4.4.1. The training items from AFI 10-1703, Volume 1 required for cybercrew duty.
       9.4.4.2. The stan/eval testing items required for cybercrew duty from any unit
       supplement to this instruction.
       9.4.4.3. Any mandatory training items not involving cybercrew duty but included at the
       discretion of the commander.
       9.4.4.4. Currency on all CIF (Volume I, Part B) items. Accomplish an initial review and
       certification of all volumes prior to an individual's first operational mission. (T-3)
       Assigned or attached cybercrew members on extensive absence from operational
       missions (90 days or more) will accomplish a complete review of all volumes and
       recertification prior to operations. (T-3)
   9.4.5. Units will define and publish their control system in the unit supplement to this
   instruction. (T-3) Use the Go/No-Go procedures to document the review, certification, and
   acknowledgment of Volume 1, Part B information by assigned, attached, and visiting
   cybercrew members. Volume 1, Part C may be monitored by using Go/No Go procedures at
   unit discretion.
9.5. Trend Analysis Program. Trend analysis refers to the collecting of information to identify
a pattern or predict future events. Each stan/eval function will establish a trend analysis program
to identify, document, report, and recommend corrective action for all negative trends. (T-3) The
trend analysis program is used to identify and track written, positional and periodic evaluation
data for adverse trends. Group stan/eval will publish and define their trends program in a
supplement to this instruction. (T-3)
   9.5.1. Trend Analysis Monitor. The appointed trend analysis monitor will identify, track and
   record questions that are all incorrect (i.e. same question is not missed) or questions that are
   consistently missed (i.e. a question is missed by the majority) and all discrepancies or overt
   consistencies (lack of errors) on positional evaluations to create trend data. (T-3) The trend
   analysis monitor will compile and analyze the trend data on a quarterly basis to determine if
   any adverse, negative, or positive trends exist. (T-3)
   9.5.2. Defining Trends. A positive trend is based on exceptional performance. An adverse or
   negative trend is defined as sustained poor, substandard performance by a group of members
   in a specific evaluation area over a period of time. The number of similar discrepancies
AFI10-1703V2 15 OCTOBER 2014                                                                    31


   required to constitute a trend will vary depending upon the number of evaluations
   administered for a particular position.
   9.5.3. Trend Responses (T-3). If a trend is identified by the above criteria, the trend analysis
   monitor will:
       9.5.3.1. Notify the commander in writing through the Chief of Stan/Eval of the trend
       identification and recommend appointment of OPR.
       9.5.3.2. Research and recommend corrective actions for negative trends.
       9.5.3.3. Assign an Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR).
       9.5.3.4. Identify the suspense date by which corrective actions will be in place.
       9.5.3.5. Follow-up on open trends to verify the actions taken to correct the trend.
       9.5.3.6. Ensure all trends are widely publicized in the unit using read files, bulletin
       boards, newsletters, or other means.
       9.5.3.7. Ensure trends are briefed at the SEB and included in minutes until closed.
   9.5.4. Closing Trends. Trends will only be closed when a subsequent quarterly trend analysis
   indicates the adverse trend no longer exists.
9.6. Stan/Eval Board. An SEB is a forum convened at the group level to review and resolve
stan/eval related issues. Examples include evaluation results, trends noticed during evaluations,
stan/eval manning, waiver/extensions of evaluations, inspection results, and memoranda of
agreement. Group stan/eval will publish and define its SEB program in a supplement to this
instruction. (T-3)
9.7. Disposition of Documentation. Dispose of IQFs and other related material according to
the AF Records Disposition Schedule (RDS), Table 36-12, Rule 02.00, and AF guidance
concerning the protection of Personally Identifiable Information.

                                  EVALUATION CRITERIA

A3.1. The following information provides assistance in developing evaluation criteria:
   A3.1.1. Identify areas/subareas essential for mission accomplishment.
   A3.1.2. Define the area criticality level (Critical (C), Major (M) or Minor (m).
   A3.1.3. Group like tasks/subtasks and consolidate in a comprehensive area/subarea.
A3.1.3.1. Critical Area/Subarea. These are tasks that could result in mission failure, endanger
human life, or cause serious injury or death. Critical areas/subareas have the greatest potential for
extreme mission or personnel impacts and drive the most stringent training and evaluation
program requirements. Critical areas/subareas apply to time-sensitive tasks or tasks that must be
accomplished as expeditiously as possible without any intervening lower priority actions that
would, in the normal sequence of events, adversely affect task performance/outcome.

A3.1.3.2. Major Area/Subarea. These are tasks deemed integral to the performance of other
tasks and required to sustain acceptable weapon system operations and mission execution. Major
areas/subareas drive significant training requirements.

A3.1.3.3. Minor Area/Subarea. These are rudimentary or simple tasks related to weapons system
operations that by themselves have little or no impact on mission execution. Minor
areas/subareas require the least stringent training requirements.

   A3.1.4. For each area/subarea, identify the cybercrew position, Master Training Task List
   items included under the area/subareas, and the grading criteria for evaluation. Critical
   areas/subareas are graded either Q or U and Major/Minor area/subareas are graded with
   either a Q, Q- or U rating. Areas/subareas should also be marked with an “R” if required to
   be included on all evaluations. If not required on both a QUAL and MSN evaluation, precede
   the “R” with a Q for QUAL or M for MSN.
   A3.1.5. Use the sample areas/subareas on the next pages as examples of required formatting
   only.

Table A3.1. (Sample) Critical Area Requirements
 AREA 1: PERFORM EMERGENCY ACTION PROECEDURES (C) - R

                     PERFORMANCE EXAMINATION SCENARIO

A5.1. Use the following guidelines when developing a performance examination scenario (T-3):
   A5.1.1. Unit stan/eval will develop and maintain a minimum of two scenarios per weapon
   system position.
   A5.1.2. Scenarios will be mission based as compared to task oriented. The scenario should
   enable the examinee to move through events as they would normally when executing
   operational duties in the evaluated position.
   A5.1.3. Scenarios will be as realistic as possible. Account for normal cybercrew structures
   and consider evaluating in a cybercrew setting rather than a one-on-one setting.
   A5.1.4. Scenarios will reflect current approved evaluation criteria as well as current
   operations. As operations change, update evaluation criteria and scenarios as required.
   A5.1.5. Scenarios will identify the area(s)/subarea(s) being evaluated, the supporting
   material/people required and any system configurations required.
       A5.1.5.1. Develop supporting inject material at the same time as the scenario and label it
       in a manner that can be easily referenced in the scenario.
   A5.1.6. Scenario developers should anticipate all possible responses (correct or incorrect)
   the examinee could take in response to injects and anticipate any possible safety or security
   concerns.
   A5.1.7. The Group Chief of Stan/Eval will approve scenarios prior to their implementation.
       A5.1.7.1. Unit stan/eval personnel will conduct a dry run on the scenario prior to
       submitting it for approval.
       A5.1.7.2. The scenario will indicate the individual(s) involved in the scenario
       development, the date of dry-run and a signature block for the Group Chief of Stan/Eval.
   A5.1.8. Re-certify scenarios at a minimum annually.
