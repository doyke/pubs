1. Overview. This instruction provides the basic understanding of how the AF DCGS ISSOs
assigned to the 480 ISRW and their appropriate subordinate units will support the AF/A2
designated Authorizing Official for systems associated with the AF Distributed Common Ground
System (DCGS) baseline. In order to maintain information system risk and associated mission
risk at an acceptable level, it is imperative that there is:
   1.1. A clear understanding of the ISSO’s roles and responsibilities.
 2                                                       AFISRAI33-201 5 DECEMBER 2012


     1.2. An unfettered line of communication between the ISSOs and the AO.
2. Chain of Responsibilities. The Air Force, as an Intelligence Community (IC) Element, is
required, per Intelligence Community Directive 503, to apply standards for security certification
assessment, testing, processing and reporting as published, issued and promulgated by the
Intelligence Community (IC) Chief Information Officer (CIO).
     2.1. AF/A2. AF/A2 has delegated IC Element authorities to AFISRA/A6 and designated an
     Authorizing Official within the directorate for AF Sensitive Compartmented Information
     (SCI) systems, Guest SCI systems and Collateral (Top Secret and below) ISR mission
     systems when authorized by National Authorizing Officials.
     2.2. AFISRA/A6. AFISRA/A6 is responsible for Information Assurance guidance, training
     and support to USAF organizations processing, transmitting or storing SCI on ISR systems.
     2.3. Authorizing Official (AO). The AO is responsible for ensuring AF ISR systems have
     the appropriate security controls in place and effectively functioning to mitigate risk to an
     acceptable level in accordance with National security policies, thus assuring these systems
     continue to be authorized to operate in support of ISR missions.
     2.4. Information System Security Officer (ISSO). The overarching role the ISSO performs
     is:
        2.4.1. Implementation of appropriate security controls to maintain information system
        risk and associated mission risk at an acceptable level as determined by the AF/A2
        designated AO.
        2.4.2. Ensuring new installations or upgrades (i.e., software, hardware, system, etc.) to
        AF DCGS are properly assessed and authorized by the AO prior to operation to avoid
        introducing unaccepted risk into the AF DGCS Weapon System.
        2.4.3. Ensuring the implemented security controls are continuously monitored and
        maintained and periodic evaluations are performed for adequacy.
3. Responsibilities.
     3.1. AF DCGS ISSOs will:
        3.1.1. Manage the planning and accomplishment of Assessments & Authorizations
        (A&A) for AF DCGS projects including upgrades, modifications and new capabilities.
        For each project, ensure technical requirements are complete and security documentation
        is available at least 3 duty days prior to Security Control Assessor’s arrival or an
        upgrade/installation begins.
        3.1.2. Develop and maintain site-specific Appendix G of the System Security
        Authorization Agreement (SSAA) for the DCGS Weapon System.
        3.1.3. Prepare and submit AO approval requests for temporary accreditations, such as an
        IATT, in time to avoid project delays.
        3.1.4. Exercise risk management techniques to analyze the site-specific security
        implications of proposed AF DCGS system upgrades and modifications and validate risk
        mitigation strategies against current Intelligence Community security standards. Notify
        the AO of increased risk to the AF DCGS system.
AFISRAI33-201 5 DECEMBER 2012                                                                 3


     3.1.5. Evaluate new or modified software scripts within AO-approved timeframes and
     guidance.
     3.1.6. Perform oversight and compliance activities to ensure implemented security
     controls are monitored and maintained to adequately protect the confidentiality, integrity
     and availability of the AF DCGS enterprise. Examples of activities include vulnerability
     management, auditing, accreditation maintenance, Plan of Action & Milestones
     (POA&M) progress, patch management, security scanning, incident response, etc.
     Justifications for non-compliance will be documented and provided to the AO within 10
     days of discovery; POA&Ms will be established and updated monthly to track progress.
     3.1.7. Support Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) compliance--
     create and update A&A artifacts in the appropriate electronic data repository.
     3.1.8. Report time-sensitive AF DCGS information assurance issues directly to the AO.
     These issues include, but are not limited to, computer incident reporting, script approval,
     and A&A efforts up to and including Approvals to Operate, FISMA reporting, POA&M
     reporting and resolutions.
  3.2. 480 ISRW and associated subordinate units will:
     3.2.1. Designate in writing, to the AF/A2 designated AO, two ISSOs at each core AF
     DCGS site.
         3.2.1.1. Coordinate with the AO with regards to AF DCGS ISSO replacements or
         other administrative actions that impact assignments.
     3.2.2. Provide funding for training and travel in support of responsibilities that fall
     outside the scope of their responsibilities as ISSOs and for which all members of the unit
     are eligible.
     3.2.3. Ensure any supervisory responsibilities and/or additional duties assigned do not
     impact support to the DCGS Weapon System.
  3.3. AF/A2 designated Authorizing Official will:
     3.3.1. Maintain oversight and control over security related matters outlined in the ISSO
     responsibilities section. With regards to these matters, the AO will have direct authority
     over the ISSOs and unfettered lines of communication.
     3.3.2. Provide funding for training and travel required to specifically execute the AF
     DCGS ISSO responsibilities.
     3.3.3. Provide operational input to the immediate rater for use in their performance
     appraisals.

Terms
Assessment & Authorization (A&A)— ICD 503 directs security assessments to no longer be
policy-based (Certification & Accreditation), but rather, risk-based (Risk Management
Framework). Assessment and Authorization are two of the six steps in the total Risk
Management Framework.
Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)— United States legislation that
defines a comprehensive framework to protect government information, operations and assets
against natural or man-made threats. FISMA amended 44 U.S.C. §§ 3541–3549, Information
Security, and was signed into law as part of the Electronic Government Act of 2002. FISMA
assigns responsibilities to various agencies to ensure the security of data in the federal
government. The act requires program officials, and the head of each agency, to conduct annual
reviews of information security programs, with the intent of keeping risks at or below specified
acceptable levels in a cost-effective, timely and efficient manner. The National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) outline nine steps toward compliance with FISMA.
