Supersedes: CFETP 4V0X1, 1 March 2007
OPR: 383 TRS/XUFG (MSgt Scott A. Morehouse)
Certified By: 4V0X1 CFM (CMSgt Lynn E. Lawrence)                                  Number of Printed Pages: 2
                                               Summary of Changes

The CFETP is revised to certification requirements for both the 5-level and 7-level. This change is to add
certification at the 5-skill level to ensure personnel attain certification prior to 5 years of graduation of the
Ophthalmic Apprentice Course. The certification change is to reduce the funding needed to send personnel on
temporary duty order to accomplish the performance test (waived for personnel testing within 5 years of graduation
of the Ophthalmic Apprentice Course). Change in the wording of the 7-level requirements is to eliminate
misinterpretation of deadline for certification. The change for maintenance of the CFETP is to eliminate the
requirement for MSgt-CMSgt, Instructors at the Ophthalmic Apprentice Course, and the Career Development
Course Writer. This eliminates the duplication of proficiency for schoolhouse personnel that must documented
using a faculty folder.
