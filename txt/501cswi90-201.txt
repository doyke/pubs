1. Purpose of the Exercise Evaluation Program (EEP).
   1.1. The 501st Combat Support Wing must be able to rapidly respond to major accidents, natural
   disasters and other peacetime and wartime contingencies. The Wing Commander uses the exercise
   evaluation program and the respective installation EEP to assess the Wing’s and the respective Wing
   installations' capability to perform their respective missions.
2. Program Responsibilities.
   2.1. Each Air Base Group Commander (ABG/CC) within the 501st Combat Support Wing approves
   the yearly exercise schedule and all simulation and provides commander’s oversight of the EEP.
   These schedules will be provided for review to 501 CSW/CC. In addition, each Air Base Group
   Commander will:

        2.2.10.1. Monitoring the composition of each ABG EET appointed by ABG/CC in
        accordance with paragraph 2.1.
        2.2.10.2. Brief newly assigned EET team chiefs on their responsibilities before participation
        in an exercise, but normally no later than 30 days after appointment.
        2.2.10.3. Monitor exercise findings and the completion of corrective actions and provide
        regular updates to 501 CSW/CC.
     2.2.11. When conducting a 501 CSW/CC directed exercise, prepare a Master Sequence of
     Events’ List (MSEL) based on Wing functional inputs to meet exercise objectives. Conduct a
     line-item walk-through of the MSEL with the EET team before the exercise. The MSEL will
     include all exercise inputs, in chronological order. As a minimum, each line item will include the
     event, objective, EET responsible for initiating and monitoring the event, and any other data to
     aid in synchronizing exercise inputs. Ensure that Group EET team chiefs follow this same
     methodology.
     2.2.12. Operational Risk Management (ORM) will be an integral part of exercise planning and
     conduct and will be inspected whenever Wing ―       looks‖ at base exercises are conducted. An
     ORM worksheet will be completed and retained as part of the exercise packet with the MSEL by
     the respective EET team chief for all exercises other those that are seminar based.
     2.2.13. Obtain 501 CSW/CC or CV approval for the use of smoke grenades, smoke generators
     and ground burst simulators (GBS). Ensure the location for use of these items is listed in the

     those simulations authorized in writing by USAFE/IG will be considered for approval.
     2.2.15. Play the role of higher headquarters (HHQ) and host nation functions as appropriate
     during exercises.
     2.2.16. All EET exercise hotwashes within 501 CSW will be conducted within 3 duty days of
     exercise termination.
  2.3. ABG EET team chiefs will:
     2.3.1. Develop base exercise scenarios and annual exercise schedules consistent with the
     requirements of Table 7.1, AFI 10-2501.
     2.3.2. Provide their EET evaluators with areas of responsibility and the checklists for the areas
     they are tasked to evaluate.
     2.3.3. Ensure the assigned areas and events are evaluated with applicable criteria.
4                                                                     501CSWI90-201 27 APRIL 2009


       2.3.4. Compile and prepare after action reports (AAR) for their conducted exercises events in
       the format prescribed in Attachment 3. Provide a copy findings, recommended improvement
       areas and strengths, through ABG/CC to 501 CSW/IG. Document evaluations and write in
       sufficient detail, including reference directives, to assist base Offices of Primary Responsibility
       (OPR) in taking corrective action.
       2.3.5. Maintain a consolidated tracking for all exercise findings to ensure corrective action is
       taken and the finding is closed. This tracking will consist of the following items: Exercise
       number; Date; Finding, to include reference to the standard not met; EET member making
       finding; OPR for Remedial Action; Estimated Completion Date (ECD) for redial action; Date
       Closed; Comments (if warranted). EET members making finding will coordinate with the
       respective OPR and provide input to the EET Team Chief. The EET Team Chief will provide a
       report every 30 days to the respective ABG/CC, copy furnished to 501 CSW/IG, until all
       exercise findings are closed. The EET team chief will actively engage with respective
       Group/Squadron/Flight OPRs identified in the exercise finding in this process.
       2.3.6. Debriefs commanders and wing staff agency chiefs, on exercise results, if requested.
       2.3.7. Determine the number of evaluators for their teams. Ensure evaluators have expertise in
       the areas they are evaluating.
       2.3.8. Ensure EET evaluators in their areas are familiar with current evaluation criteria, unit
       plans and exercise objectives.
       2.3.9. Attend all required EET meetings.
    2.4. EET members will:
       2.4.1. Perform EET duties for the duration of the exercise, including the hotwash and report
       writing or until released by the group team chief.
       2.4.2. Evaluate all exercise events as tasked by their team chief or 501 CSW/IG. Team members
       will not inject ―f
                        ree play‖ events into the exercise; only approved MSEL injects will be used.
       2.4.3. Turn in their completed evaluations to their team chief for the area and event evaluated.
       2.4.4. Attend meetings as determined by the team chief.
       2.4.5. Complete all prescribed EET training in a timely manner and report completion to the
       respective team chief.
3. Exercise Ground Rules and Approved Simulations.
    3.1. The following are general ground rules applicable to all base-wide exercises. Specific ground
    rules and approved simulations for specific types of exercises are listed below.
       3.1.1. EET team chiefs will submit simulation/deviation through their respective ABG
       Commander through 501 CSW/CE for 501 CSW/CC approval using an electronic staff summary
       sheet; see Attachment 2. Normally, only simulations listed by USAFE/IG will be considered for
       approval. Simulations will not be used to resolve conflicts between conflicting or competing
       requirements, nor as a matter of convenience.
       3.1.2. EET members will wear an appropriate identification (evaluator badge, black and white
       vest) and necessary safety gear while performing evaluations. Although EET members must be
       able to move about the exercise area freely, they may only enter areas appropriate to the exercise
       at hand. Classified areas/SCIFs must only be entered during exercises by those personnel
501CSWI90-201 27 APRIL 2009                                                                             5


     appropriately cleared and identified for that level of access. EET members will not use their
     position to help exercise saboteurs or intruders gain access to restricted areas or other facilities.
     3.1.3. Exercise observers will wear an observer badge, issued by the respective EET team chief
     or 501 CSW/IG, and will not interfere in the evaluation or exercise.
     3.1.4. All personnel will be evaluated on the exercise objectives and standards outlined in HQ
     USAFE/IG or other applicable written criteria. The following principles for a successful
     evaluation also apply:
         3.1.4.1. Show me! Performance is the primary focus of any exercise or evaluation. 501
         CSW/CC will direct EET and exercise inspections, using the checklist at Attachment 4, on a
         ―no notice‖ basis.
         3.1.4.2. Mission accomplishment using proven and safe procedures is the end goal.
         3.1.4.3. Safety and security take precedence over all exercise events. EET team members
         will take immediate action to suspend exercise play within their purview if a safety hazard
         occurs and will notify the EET team chief. Play will resume ONLY when the hazard has
         been removed or abated.
     3.1.5. In the event of an actual emergency, exercise play by emergency response teams (i.e., fire
     service personnel, security forces, medical, etc.) will cease until the emergency is terminated or
     released by the Incident Commander (IC) or Emergency Operations Center (EOC) Commander.
         3.1.5.1. Force Protection Conditions (FP). All facilities will post ― Exercise Force Protection
         Condition‖ signs at each entrance. If the installation is in a real world FP condition, both the
         real world and the ―exercise‖ FP condition sign will be posted. During increased exercise FP
         conditions, main base gates will be used to demonstrate increased security measures. Other
         open gates, such as used for local commercial, postal or contract deliveries will usually only
         conduct normal identification card checks commensurate with the real world FP condition
         unless otherwise directed by the ABG commander.
     3.1.6. Giant Voice may be used during local exercises and higher headquarters inspections. The
     respective EET Team Chief will notify the respective Base RAF Commander in writing at least
     seven days in advance of any exercise involving use of Giant Voice, unless otherwise dictated by
     local conditions, practice or memorandum of agreement (MOA). The RAF Commander may
     notify appropriate local community leaders of expected Giant Voice use. Base public affairs
     personnel will also notify the public sector prior to the exercise by contacting local newspapers
     and radio networks.
     3.1.7. All exercise message traffic will be via SIPRNET or NIPRNET and labeled ―
                                                                                    EXERCISE
     ONLY–DO NOT TRANSMIT TO NON-EXERCISE ACTIVITES.‖ Specific exercise written
     or voice message traffic will be preceded and concluded by stating: ―
                                                                         EXERCISE, EXERCISE,
     EXERCISE‖.
  3.2. Exercise Exempt Personnel. As in all exercises, there is a small population of personnel which,
  for various reasons, is not required to respond to exercise events. Exempt personnel should remain
  clear of the exercise play area if possible. They will not assist exercise players by any means. ABG
  commanders will be responsible for deciding who within their groups is exempt. The following
  categories are normally considered exercise exempt:
     3.2.1. Personnel on temporary duty to their base.
6                                                                       501CSWI90-201 27 APRIL 2009


       3.2.2. On-duty military personnel within 30 days of in-processing or out-processing may be
       excused based on their in/out processing schedule. All requests for non-play must be routed
       through the Squadron Commander/Group Deputy Commander.
       3.2.3. Personnel conducting or taking any base testing, overseas orientation, initial relocation
       and retirement or separation briefings. The exempt time will only be for travel to and from the
       testing or briefing site and during testing or briefing.
       3.2.4. Military members conducting/attending classes.
       3.2.5. Civilians: Civilian employees and contractors are not usually exercise participants unless
       deemed emergency essential by the commander; however, they can support exercise events and
       alarm conditions as agreed upon within their position descriptions and contracts.
       3.2.6. Civil Engineers: During snow removal operations, all civil engineers and augmentees
       performing snow removal duties are exempt from exercise participation.
       3.2.7. Security Forces will not respond to exercise injects while performing base entry control
       duties.
       3.2.8. Personnel conducting mission essential activities during exercises.
           3.2.8.1. Some base work centers may, at the discretion of the respective Group Commander,
           have limited, duty-specific exemptions that preclude some facility occupants from
           responding to exercise events. The number of duty-specific personnel who are exempt from
           exercise play must be kept to the minimum necessary to perform mission-essential taskings.
           Commanders may designate positions within the provisions of their exercise instruction.
           3.2.8.2. In all cases, Security Forces (SF) or Incident Commanders (IC) will establish
           cordons where required, but will allow mission-essential personnel and vehicles through as
           directed by the IC.
3.2.8.3. The lead Fire Services EET member will brief the Fire Department Chief at least 30 minutes
prior to exercise start time. This notification will be made irrespective of whether there is Fire Services
exercise play in the scenario. Likewise, if the ABG/SE has not been involved in exercise planning, a
similar notification will be made by the EET Team Chief to ABG/SE.
    3.3. Exercise Exempt Locations. The ABG Commander may, based on mission, exempt certain
    facilities from exercise play on a standing basis or based on exercise scenario. These exemptions
    may be written into the base exercise instruction.
    3.4. Major Accident Response Exercises (MARE) and Natural Disaster Response (NDRE)
    Exercises.
       3.4.1. Cordons and Winds. Exercise cordons will be announced. Real-world winds will be used
       for all MAREs. NDREs will use scenario-specific weather injects, coordinated through 100
       OSS/OSW. Limit all activities, such as establishment of entry control points and on-scene
       control points, halting traffic, etc., to within the installation perimeter.
       3.4.2. Emergency response vehicles will respond to exercises using lights without sirens.
    3.5. Enemy Attack Response Exercises (EARE). Exercise attacks may be initiated with smoke
    machines, smoke pots, GBSs or input cards. Exercise participants will respond to exercise injects
    using procedures in the AFMAN 10-100, Airman’s Manual, and local procedures. Roving EET
    members may be used to evaluate individual protective actions in response to alarm signals and may
    request individuals to demonstrate proficiency in any of the tasks listed in the Airman’s Manual.

      3.5.1. CBRN Defense Equipment:
          3.5.1.1. Reference AFI 10-2501 Table 8.1. ABGs will use CBRN defense equipment within
          the limits of their resources.
      3.5.2. Exercise Casualties and Fatalities. The follow general guidelines will be used within
      exercises:
          3.5.2.1. Personnel that receive a ― minor injury‖ inject will return to duty upon release by
          medical authority or EET evaluator.
          3.5.2.2. Personnel that receive ―   seriously injured or killed‖ injects will be simulated as
          medically evacuated. They will be removed from the exercise for the remainder of their shift
          and may come back to the work center only after the unit has taken the appropriate backfill
          actions and after approval of unit EET member.
          3.5.2.3. All personnel ―
                                 killed in action‖ will be processed in accordance with AFI 34-242,
          Mortuary Affairs Program, Chapter 12.
          3.5.2.4. Retrieval of exercise deceased remains by mortuary affairs or local medical
          personnel from the designated CCP will be simulated unless specifically directed within the
          MESL or by the Group or Wing Commander. Completion of DD Form 2064, Overseas
          Death Certificate, 1 April 1977, by medical personnel will also be simulated.
      3.5.3. Post-Attack Reconnaissance (PAR) and Base Recovery After Attack (BRAAT):
          3.5.3.1. Digging for unexploded explosive ordinance (UXO) holding areas, UXO trenches,
          decon water run-off, etc. will be simulated by an outline of sandbags (or cordon of ribbon)
          and identification signs indicating the location.
          3.5.3.2. Tone-down and denial plans will not be implemented; however, units will develop
          written procedures based on the threat in the exercise scenario and must be able to brief
          procedures to EET evaluators.
      3.5.4. Blackout Procedures:
          3.5.4.1. For vehicles and equipment, place a single strip of 2-inch masking tape marked
          "Blackout" on all appropriate areas.
          3.5.4.2. For facilities, complete a full blackout of 1 window and the main entrance with
          whatever appropriate materials are on hand. The remaining facility entrance and windows
