                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. This instruction establishes responsibilities and operating procedures for vehicle
operations on Eglin AFB and Duke Field airfields. Airfield driving is for official use only
with maximum attention paid to safety and accident prevention. Drivers may not deviate from
procedures or principles set forth in this instruction except in the interest of safety. Airfield
safety is paramount. Conscientious and safe driving can prevent most accidents.
1.2. The goal of the Airfield Driving Program (ADP) is to maintain a safe environment for
flying operations. Motor vehicles on the airfield -present a clear and definite danger, both to
aircraft and ground personnel. Carelessness, haste and disregard for established safety standards
are the primary sources of aircraft-vehicle incidents.
1.3. The standards set forth in this instruction apply to all motor vehicles on the airfield as
well as unit-owned/operated bicycles.
1.4. This instruction does not address every possible airfield driving scenario. Contact
Airfield Management (AM) to resolve any questions or for any required clarification.

following procedures:
   5.13.1. Pedestrians are authorized on the airfield for official business in support of the flying
   mission.
   5.13.2. At Duke Field, no pedestrian movements are authorized on perimeter road without
   coordination from AM
   5.13.3. Walk facing oncoming traffic.
   5.13.4. Do not sit or recline on the ramp in such a manner that interferes with normal ground
   vehicle and aircraft operations.
   5.13.5. Do not enter the CMA without two-way radio contact and approval from the tower.

      Control Stop Signs are located at the approach end of Rwy 12 on perimeter road. These
      two devices mark the boundary of the ILS critical area. When the RED light is steady,
      you must STOP and yield for approaching aircraft. When the light is blinking, you must
      STOP and look both ways before proceeding. See Figure 5.1

      5.14.1.4. Crossing of Second and Barrancas Street on the taxiway leading to the Climatic
      Hangar Area. The traffic light will be utilized for all aircraft, equipment, and vehicles
      (such as tugs, tractors, etc) whose forward movement is insufficient to allow for an
      expeditious crossing. Other vehicles will refrain from using the light unless unacceptable
      delays are encountered before a safe crossing is possible. Vehicles approaching the light
      on the street will be allowed a safe distance in which to stop. When the street traffic has
      been stopped and the intersection is clear, proceed with the crossing. All vehicles will
      utilize the designated crossing area; the vehicle operator is responsible for ensuring the
      traffic light is turned off when crossing has been completed. Pedestrians and personnel
      on bicycles are permitted to cross at this intersection, but they may not use the light. See
      figure 5.4

                                           Chapter 6

               CONTROLLED MOVEMENT AREA AND PROCEDURES

6.1. Eglin CMAs
   6.1.1. The Eglin CMAs consist of Rwys 19/1 and 12/30, overruns, all taxiways between the
   runways and the VFR hold position markings, and the grassy infields between the runways
   and 100ft from the runway edge.
   6.1.2. Airfield Drivers must stop and hold at the "INST/ILS" marking/sign on Twy V.
6.2. Duke Field CMA. The Duke CMAs consist of Rwy 18/36, ALZ, overruns, all taxiways
between the runways and the VFR hold position markings and the grassy infields between the
runways and 100ft from the runway edge.
6.3. Procedures
   6.3.1. Vehicle operators with identified color vision impairment will not be assigned duties
   requiring access into the controlled movement area.
   6.3.2. Vehicles operating in the controlled movement area must use rotating beacon lights or
   hazard/warning flashers IAW T.O. 36-1-191.
   6.3.3. Pilots operating aircraft will not escort vehicles on/across the runway.
   6.3.4. Tower is the only controlling agency authorized to approve vehicles on or across the
   runway/CMA.
   6.3.5. All personnel will use perimeter roads to the maximum extent possible. Limit vehicle
   traffic crossing the runway to those performing mission essential duties and only to an
   absolute minimum. Vehicles crossing the runways will do so at one of the intersections
   below unless operational necessity dictates otherwise. During non-emergency situations only
   cross the runway if duties dictate, otherwise use access roads whenever possible.
      6.3.5.1. Authorized runway crossing points at Eglin are Twys D, H, and J.
      6.3.5.2. Authorized runway crossing points at Duke are Twys C, D, and F.
   6.3.6. Vehicles operating in the CMA on a daily basis should have a permanent radio
   mounted in the vehicle to communicate with the tower. A hand-held radio should only be
   used as a backup or when communication is required outside the vehicle. Note: Conduct an
   operational test of the radio before entering the airfield.
6.4. Radio Communications
   6.4.1. Radio communications are a critical link in the ATC system. The single most
   important element in communicating with the tower is to understand instructions. It is
   essential to acknowledge each radio communication with controllers by using the appropriate
   call sign.
   6.4.2. All vehicles operating in the controlled movement area will maintain direct two-way
   radio communications with the tower at all times unless being escorted by another vehicle
   who is maintaining two-way radio communications. Personnel working outside the vehicle
EGLINAFBI13-213 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                  31


   must have a hand radio or have someone in the vehicle monitoring communications at all
   times.
   6.4.3. Observe proper radio discipline at all times. Transmissions will be brief, clearly
   spoken and include only information pertinent to the situation. All instructions received will
   be repeated by the vehicle operator for verification before taking any action. If in doubt, ask
   the tower to repeat the transmission.
   6.4.4. In the event radio communications have been lost with the tower, exit the runway and
   controlled movement area immediately. Communications must be restored before returning
   into the CMA/runway. Signs that you may have lost communications with the tower are:
      6.4.4.1. If the tower is using light gun signals then, outside the CMA, the driver should
      turn the vehicle toward the tower and start flashing the vehicle headlights and wait for the
      controller to signal with the light gun.
      6.4.4.2. Tower will flash the runway edge lights on and off to alert vehicle
      operators/pedestrians on the runway that there is a problem and/or emergency that
      requires them to exit the runway immediately.
      6.4.4.3. All vehicle operators/pedestrians must exit the runway immediately. Contact
      tower or AM immediately, advise when off the runway, and include any pertinent
      information that might affect safe runway operations. If not able to communicate with
      tower or AM via radio, use other means of communication such as a cellular phone
      (when available). Report the incident to AM immediately.
   6.4.5. Brevity is important, therefore, radio transmissions must be kept as brief as possible.
   However, controllers must know what you want to do before they can properly carry out their
   control duties. Conversely, the vehicle operator must know exactly what the controller wants
   them to do.
   6.4.6. Vehicle operators must maintain vigilance in monitoring air traffic control radio
   communications frequencies for situational awareness, especially when operating on an
   active runway.
   6.4.7. Listen before transmitting. If someone else is talking, the keying of another
   transmitter      will be ineffective and will probably override/block out the other receiver
   causing the other vehicle operator to repeat his or her call.
   6.4.8. The tower controller will not issue or use conditional instructions (blanket approval)
   when authorizing vehicles to enter the runway for the purpose of an airfield inspection/check
   or other airfield operation. See FAA JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control for additional
   information.
6.5. Radio Techniques
   6.5.1. Think before keying the transmitter. You must know exactly what you need to say
   before you say it.
   6.5.2. The microphone should be very close to your lips and, after pressing the “microphone
   button”, a slight pause may be necessary to be sure the first word is transmitted clearly.
   Speak in a normal, conversational tone.
 32                                                     EGLINAFBI13-213 1 AUGUST 2013


   6.5.3. When releasing the microphone button, wait a few seconds before calling again. The
   controller may be looking for you on the airfield, transmitting on a different frequency, or
   scanning the runway to enable your request.
   6.5.4. Be alert to the sounds or the lack of sounds in the receiver. Check your volume,
   recheck your frequency, and make sure that your microphone is not stuck in the transmit
   position. Frequency blockage can, and has, occurred for extended periods due to
   unintentional transmitter operation. This type of interference is commonly referred to as a
   “stuck mike,” and controllers may refer to it in this manner when attempting to correct the
   problem.
   6.5.5. Be sure that you are within the performance range of your radio equipment and the
   ground station equipment.
6.6. Phraseology
   6.6.1. Vehicle operators must contact the tower each time they proceed onto or leave the
   CMA. Before proceeding into a CMA, vehicle operators must advise the controller of three
   things: WHO you are, WHERE you are, and WHAT your intentions are. Vehicle operators
   must always acknowledge all communications so Ground Control and other persons know
   that the message was received. Vehicle operators must always give aircraft and ground
   control transmissions priority unless an emergency exists. VHF/UHF transmissions are
   reserved for the primary use of aircraft and tower personnel.
   6.6.2. A typical runway crossing transmission sequence is as follows:
          VEHICLE OPERATOR: “EGLIN GROUND, FOUR TWO THREE.”
          TOWER: “FOUR TWO THREE, EGLIN GROUND.”
          VEHICLE OPERATOR: “GROUND, FOUR TWO THREE, REQUEST TO
          CROSS RUNWAY ONE NINE AT TAXIWAY GOLF.”
          TOWER: “FOUR TWO THREE, CROSS RUNWAY ONE NINE AT TAXIWAY
          GOLF, REPORT WHEN OFF.”
      6.6.2.1. Always read back instructions verbatim before taking any action and allow time
      for correction, if misinterpreted. If you are unsure what the controller has transmitted, or
      if you do not understand an instruction, you MUST ask the controller to “SAY AGAIN”.
      Good communication only occurs when each party knows and understands what the other
      is saying.
               VEHICLE OPERATOR: “GROUND, FOUR TWO THREE
               UNDERSTANDS APPROVED TO CROSS RUNWAY ONE NINE AT
               TAXIWAY GOLF. WILL REPORT WHEN OFF.”
      6.6.2.2. Vehicle operator visually scans the runway prior to entry, and then proceeds
      across the runway.
               VEHICLE OPERATOR: “GROUND, FOUR TWO THREE IS OFF
               RUNWAY ONE NINE AT TAXIWAY GOLF.”
               TOWER: “FOUR TWO THREE, ROGER.”
EGLINAFBI13-213 1 AUGUST 2013                                                            33


      6.6.2.3. If vehicle operators are issued hold short instructions, they are required to
      provide a read back to the tower.
               TOWER: “FOUR TWO THREE, EGLIN GROUND, HOLD SHORT
               RUNWAY ONE NINE AT TAXIWAY GOLF.”
               VEHICLE OPERATOR: “GROUND, FOUR TWO THREE, COPY
               HOLDING SHORT RUNWAY ONE NINE AT TAXIWAY GOLF.”

6.7. Phonetic Aviation Alphabet. Because some letters have similar sounds, like B and P, the
international aviation community uses the following words to reduce confusion. For example,
Twy B would be referred to as Twy Bravo on the radio. See Table 6.2 for Phonetic Aviation
Alphabet:

6.8. Call Signs for Vehicles That Operate in CMA
    6.8.1. Vehicle drivers and/or pedestrians operating on the CMA must use a distinct call sign
    (e.g., Airfield 1, Chief 1, Sweeper 1, TA 1, etc.) coordinated by the wing ADPM to avoid
    different agencies using similar names (e.g., Airfield 1, Airfield Lighting, Airfield Sweeper,
    etc.) or confusing call sign. Note: Do not use a call sign that is also a part of ATC
    phraseology such as “Taxi”.
    6.8.2. For standardization, AM personnel will only use the radio call signs listed below.
       6.8.2.1. Airfield Manager (Airfield – 1).
       6.8.2.2. Deputy/Assistant Airfield Manager (Airfield – 2).
       6.8.2.3. NCOIC, AM, NCOIC, AM Training and AM Ops personnel or civilian
       equivalents (Airfield 3, 4, 5, etc.).
    6.8.3. For other airfield drivers, see Table 6.3. Vehicle Call Signs. TWI 33-101 and 919
    MXG OI 21-101 have additional call signs.

       AIRFIELD MARKINGS, SIGNS, AND RUNWAY/TAXIWAY LIGHTING

7.1. Airfield Signs and Markings
   7.1.1. There are two types of airfield signs, mandatory and informational.
      7.1.1.1. Mandatory signs, such as a rwy hold sign, must be followed. These signs are
      recognizable by their white inscription on a red background. See Figure 7.1

Figure 7.1. Mandatory Signs




      7.1.1.2. Informational signs indicate a specific location or destination, and/or provide
      useful information, such as taxiway designations/directions. Informational signs have
      black inscription on a yellow background or the inverse of this color scheme. See Figure
      7.2.

Figure7.2. Informational Signs




   7.1.1.3. Visual Flight Rules (VFR) hold line. The VFR hold line marking marks the
   boundaries of the controlled movement area. This marking consists of two solid six-inch
   wide yellow lines and two dashed six-inch wide yellow lines running across each taxiway at
   least 100 feet from the runway edge. Entering this area without clearance from the control
   tower will cause an aircraft on approach or takeoff to abort. You must hold short and receive
   permission from the tower prior to entering the runway, and notify the tower when you exit
   the runway. See Figure 7.3
 38                                                     EGLINAFBI13-213 1 AUGUST 2013


Figure 7.3. VFR Hold line




   7.1.1.4. Instrument Hold Line. Airfield Drivers must stop and hold at the instrument hold
   lines on Twy Victor during inclement weather. Tower will advise when this area is active.
   See Figure 7.4

Figure 7.4. Instrument Hold Line




7.2. Runway/Taxiway Lighting
   7.2.1. Runway edge lights are white. See Figure7.5

                                            Chapter 8

         REPORTING, ENFORCEMENT AND VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES

8.1. AM, unit commanders, unit ADPMs, and SFS personnel have authority to
suspend/revoke airfield driving privileges.
8.2. All personnel operating on the airfield -are responsible for identifying airfield driving
violations and notifying AM immediately. The Eglin/Duke wing ADPM, unit commander,
and unit ADPMs must all be notified in writing anytime airfield driving privileges are
suspended/revoked. This notification will be made within 24 hours or the next duty day of the
alleged incident, whichever occurs first.
8.3. Controlled Movement Area Violation (CMAV). A CMAV is an airfield violation caused
by aircraft, vehicles, or pedestrians entering the CMA without specific control tower approval.
This definition also includes runway incursions. A runway incursion is a CMAV event that
involves the incorrect presence of an aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface
designated for the landing and take-off of aircraft. For the purpose of this instruction, the
protected area is the same as the CMA. Runway Incursions are further classified into three
operational categories (Operational Error, Pilot Deviation, and Vehicle/Pedestrian).
   8.3.1. Anyone who witnesses a runway incursion/CMAV event will immediately notify the
   control tower, AM, and if possible stop the individual outside of the CMA until AM arrives
   on scene.
   8.3.2. Individuals crossing any Runway/ALZ hold lines at Eglin/Duke without approval
   from the tower will immediately:
       8.3.2.1. Lose both their government vehicle and airfield driving privileges for a
       minimum of 30 days. See Table 8.1
       8.3.2.2. Be suspended in the ADTP. They must re-accomplish all required initial Airfield
       Driver’s training from step 2. Unit ADPM will notify their unit commander and wing
       ADPM when suspending airfield driving privileges in the online ADTP. The unit ADPM
       will use Attachment 10 to request restoring an individual’s airfield driving privileges.
   8.3.3. AM will use the Eglin/Duke Airfield Driving Violation Incident Report, Attachment
   11, for obtaining statements from individuals and/or witnesses involved in airfield driving
   violations/incidents.
   8.3.4. The AOF/CC, SE, and wing ADPM will work as a team to assign all runway
   incursions an operational category. The AOF/CC will ensure these classifications are
   annotated in the recommendation section of the AF form 457, USAF Hazard Report or
   narrative section of the AF form 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR).
   8.3.5. AOF/CC will notify MAJCOM AO within 24 hours of a CMAV/HATR incident.
   8.3.6. The Eglin/Duke wing ADPM is responsible for taking immediate actions to correct
   any identified systematic problems and ensuring interim control measures are applied until
   permanent corrections are made.
EGLINAFBI13-213 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                    41


   8.3.7. The Eglin/Duke wing ADPM and SE must inspect the unit ADP of personnel that
   commit a runway incursion as a part of the investigation. Emphasis will be placed on how
   the unit trained the individual and their compliance with the ADI. The results will be
   reported to the unit commander.
   8.3.8. Runway Incursions and CMAV events must be reported to 96 TW/SE as outlined in
   AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports, Ch 6.
      8.3.8.1. Runway Incursions that involve aircraft/flight operations (unauthorized vehicles
      crossing a rwy while an aircraft is landing/taking off) require an AF form 651. The
      Eglin/Duke tower will forward to AOF/CC for processing with 96 TW/SE.
      8.3.8.2. For specific incidents of runway incursions and other controlled movement area
      violations that did not involve aircraft/aircraft operations, the AF form 457 will be used
      and reported to the Eglin/Duke Airfield Manager. After collecting all information, the
      Eglin/Duke wing ADPM will forward AF form 457 to AOF/CC for processing with 96
      TW/SE.
   8.3.9. The AF form 651 and/or AF form 457 must include the following information in the
   narrative section:
      8.3.9.1. Individual’s information (e.g., rank, job title, organization, TDY, or base
      assigned).
      8.3.9.2. Individual’s experience working on or near the airfield and date trained.
      8.3.9.3. If individual was authorized on the airfield and/or CMA.
      8.3.9.4. If individual completed all training required to operate a vehicle on the airfield.
      8.3.9.5. Approximate location where the CMAV occurred (e.g., runway/taxiway
      intersection, distance from threshold or overrun etc.).
      8.3.9.6. The wing ADPM will maintain a copy of the AF form 651s/457s, actions taken;
      results and supporting documentation in accordance with Air Force RDS, Table 13-06,
      Rule 15.00 (see AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Program and AFMAN 91-223,
      Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports). A copy of the final runway incursion report
      will be obtained from SE and/or MAJCOM.
   8.3.10. CMAV events must be briefed at the AOB.
      8.3.10.1. Provide a detailed description of each incident to include: What, When,
      Where, and How, type vehicle/aircraft involved and action taken to prevent a
      reoccurrence.
      8.3.10.2. Highlight any trends (e.g., annual/biannual chart showing upward or downward
      incident rate as applicable)
8.4. Non CMA Violations (e. g., careless driving, vehicle accidents, not yielding to
aircraft). See Figure 8.1
   8.4.1. Immediately report all non-CMAV events to AM Ops.
   8.4.2. AM Ops will, verify/update the violator’s information on the ADP Violator Log,
   respond to the airfield, issue the appropriate consequences IAW table 8.1., and forward
 42                                                    EGLINAFBI13-213 1 AUGUST 2013


   paperwork to the Eglin/Duke wing APDM. For violations not covered in table 8.1., the
   violator will be escorted to Base Ops to complete attachment 11. The Eglin/Duke
   AFM/wing ADPM will issue the appropriate consequences.

areas.
Controlled Movement Area (CMA)—As defined in Airfield Operation Instructions, any
portion of the airfield requiring aircraft, vehicles and pedestrians to obtain specific Tower
approval for (normally via two-way radio contact with the tower). Controlled Movement Areas
include but are not limited to areas used for takeoff, landing and as required taxiing of aircraft.
Note: This definition is used in lieu of "movement area" as defined in the FAA Pilot Controller
Glossary. Also called CMA.
Controlled Movement Area Violation (CMAV) Event—an airfield infraction caused by
aircraft, vehicles, or pedestrians entering the control movement area without specific Tower
approval. This definition includes runway incursions and infractions caused by communication
errors. Refer to AFMAN 91-223 paragraphs 1.3.1.8. for reportable HATR reporting procedures
and 1.3.1.9. for reportable CMAV events.

vicinity of the airport and on the airport movement area.
Major Command (MAJCOM)—For the purpose of this instruction, includes all USAF
MajorCommands plus the Air National Guard Readiness Center, Air Force Reserve Command,
Direct Reporting Units, and Field Operating Agencies.
Negative—No, or permission not granted, or that is not correct.
Out—the conversation is ended and no response is expected.
Over—my transmission is ended; I expect a response.
Parking Ramp/Apron—Areas where aircraft are parked, loaded and unloaded and serviced
between flights. Vehicles and aircraft operate in close proximity in these areas, so it is vital to
maintain a safe distance between your vehicle and aircraft. Always yield to aircraft and never
drive under an aircraft or its wings. Slow speed and extreme caution are required in these areas.
Perimeter Road—a road around the runway perimeter designed to connect the access roads.
Precision Obstacle Free Zone—A section of airspace above an area beginning at the runway
threshold, at the threshold elevation, and centered on the extended runway centerline.
Privately Owned Vehicle (POVs)—A vehicle that is owned or leased by a private party.
Proceed—Authorization to begin/continue on approved routes.
Ramp—either concrete or asphalt (depending on the weight of the aircraft and the sub-base of
the ground beneath) used to park aircraft or equipment.
Read Back—Repeat my message back to me.
Restricted Area—an area on the airfield designated for the use by aircraft/equipment requiring
security protection level. Marked with signs prior to entering, Red Lines will indicate the
boundaries.
Roger—I understand and have received all of your transmission.
Runway—a defined rectangular area on an airfield prepared for the landing and takeoff of
aircraft.
Runway Hold Line—a designated boundary intended to protect the runway environment.
Found at the point where a taxiway and runway intersect.
Runway Incursion—Any occurrence at an aerodrome involving the incorrect presence of an
aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-
off of aircraft. For the purpose of this instruction, the protected area is the same as the CMA.
These are further classified into three operational categories:

1) Operational Error (OE)—a failure of the air traffic control system that results in loss of
separation.
2) Pilot Deviation (PD)—the action of a pilot that results in the violation of Tower instructions,
AFIs and/or FARs.
3) Vehicle/Pedestrian Deviation (V/PD)—any entry or movement on the controlled movement
area by a vehicle (including aircraft operated by non-pilots) or pedestrian that has not been
authorized by Air Traffic Control.
Say Again—used to request a repeat of the last transmission. Usually specifies transmission was
not understood or received.
Stand By—used by controllers indicating a pause while other duties of a higher priority are
attended to. Also means to standby for clearance/approval.
Taxilane—ramp space between rows of parked aircraft used to maneuver aircraft to and from
parking spots and taxiways.
Taxiway—a paved surface for taxiing aircraft from parking ramp to runway.
Unit—for the purpose of this AFI, the term unit is equivalent to a Squadron, also known as the
basic unit in the USAF organizational structure. Squadrons are usually made up of several
flights (typically four), and commanded by a field grade officer.
Wake Turbulence—A phenomenon resulting from the passage of an aircraft through the
atmosphere. The term includes vortices, thrust stream turbulence, jet blast, jet wash, propeller
wash, and rotor wash both on the ground and in the air.
Wing Commander—the individual with ultimate responsibility for operating the airfield.
Without Delay—with a sense of urgency, proceeds with approved instructions in a rapid
manner.
Words Twice—Communication is difficult. Please say every phrase twice.
