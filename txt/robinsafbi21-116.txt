distance for taxiing aircraft in paragraph 2.3; adds equipment storage locations in paragraph 3;
adds requirements for supervisors in 5.3, adds Attachment 1 and updates Attachments 2 and 3.
1. Responsibilities.
     1.1. The 402d Aircraft Maintenance Group (402 AMXG) is responsible for coordination of
     depot aircraft movement and parking on the WR-ALC ramp.
     1.2. The 402 AMXG has the responsibility for the daily management of depot aircraft
     movement, parking, and engine operation on the WR-ALC ramp through coordination with
     Airfield Management Operations (AM Ops). 402 AMXG will review and coordinate
     annually this instruction with 402 MXW Safety Office (402 MXW/SE), Operations Support
     Squadron (78 OSS), Civil Engineering Group (778 CEG), and all aircraft squadrons to ensure
     that designated locations continue to meet regulatory guidance.
     1.3. The Aircraft Maintenance Operations Center (AMOC) will provide oversight and
     document the coordination of ALC high-risk maintenance activities such as, confined space
     entry, jacking, crane operations, etc.
     1.4. The airfield manager is responsible for other aircraft parking areas. Using or servicing
     agencies having parking spot preferences for transient aircraft must coordinate with AM Ops.
     The Airfield Manager, or designated representative, is the final approval authority for all
     transient aircraft parking. NOTE: All transient aircraft will be parked on an authorized
     parking spot unless approved by the airfield manager.
2. Aircraft Movement
     2.1. Towing Operation Procedures. All aircraft maintenance tows require prior coordination
     with the AMOC. When contacted, the AMOC will coordinate the aircraft movement with
     the 402d Aircraft Maintenance Support Squadron (402 AMXSS).
     2.2. The AMOC will coordinate with AM Ops on all tows that utilize or block active
     taxiways and runways.
     2.3. Aircraft are authorized to taxi from the following parking locations: F1, F2, F3, F4, F5,
     F6, F7, F8, F9, and building 131. Ensure no fuel servicing or maintenance operations are in
     process on adjacent aircraft before starting engines. Aircraft adjacent to a jacked aircraft on
     spots F2–F8 will be repositioned in the taxilane prior to engine start. Aircraft will not taxi
     within 100 feet of any aircraft performing fuel service or maintenance. Ensure jet blast/prop
     wash from taxiing aircraft does not affect adjacent aircraft or maintenance operations.
3. Aircraft Parking Designations, Equipment Storage Locations, and Restrictions.
     3.1. Aircraft parking locations, equipment storage locations, and maintenance restrictions are
     shown by position and organization in Attachment 2, Parking Designations, Equipment
     Storage, and Restrictions, and Attachment 3, WR-ALC Parking Ramp (drawing #
     X200714563). Parking spaces may be utilized by agencies other than those listed in
     Attachment 2 after coordination through the AMOC and approval from AM Ops.
4. Engine Operation Procedures.
     4.1. Coordination. All maintenance engine operation requests will be coordinated through
     the AMOC. The requesting agency will provide location, aircraft serial number, mission
     design series, reason, duration, and initial run status to the AMOC. The AMOC will
ROBINSAFBI21-116 12 APRIL 2011                                                                   3


   coordinate with AM Ops and the Fire Department and provide the requesting agency with
   final approval or disapproval. Prior to operating the aircraft engine, the engine operator will
   notify Robins Tower of the aircraft location, engine run start time, and continue to monitor
   until completion the tower frequency using the aircraft radio. Upon engine shut down, the
   engine operator will notify the tower and AMOC of engine run completion.
   4.2. Noise Abatement. Engine runs other than preflight are to be completed by 2200L.
   During the quiet hour periods (2200-0600), engine runs above idle speed are prohibited
   unless approved by the appropriate authority. For all ALC units, the WR-ALC Commander
   is the approval authority as currently required by RAFBI 13-203, Air Traffic Control and
   Airfield Operations. Engine runs of this nature must be kept to an absolute minimum.
   AMOC will contact the WRALC Commander, if required, and AM Ops, briefing the start
   time, reason, duration, and the location of the aircraft prior to operating the engines. AM
   Ops will notify Robins Tower of approved engine operations.
   4.3. Engine runs conducted at idle speed do not require WR-ALC Commander’s approval.
   However, engine operations at idle speed still require coordination with the AMOC, who will
   notify AM Ops and the Fire Department of the engine operation.
   4.4. If the engine operation location is not listed in Attachment 2, coordinate with AM Ops
   through AMOC to assure minimum specified distances are maintained between engine runs
   and other aircraft to minimize the impact of jet/propeller blast on other operations.
   Compliance with the distancing criteria in the weapon system specific technical data is
   mandatory.
5. Hazardous Operations
   5.1. Confined Space Operations. Anytime personnel enter a permit-required confined space
   refer to 402 MXWOI 91-25, Confined Space Entry, and the 402 Master Entry Plan (MEP).
   5.2. Fuel Cell Maintenance
      5.2.1. Primary Fuel Repair. Contact the AMOC when fuel maintenance is to be
      performed at a primary fuel repair location identified in Attachment 2. Supervisors will
      provide AMOC the aircraft serial number and location of the maintenance.
      5.2.2. Alternate Fuel Repair. All parking locations can be considered alternate fuel
      repair locations after approval. Supervisors will contact the AMOC to coordinate and
      gain approval for fuel maintenance at an alternate fuel repair location. Supervisors will
      provide AMOC the requested fuel maintenance location, aircraft serial number. AMOC
      will coordinate with Base Fire Department, 402 MXW Safety Office, AM Ops,
      Environmental Management, and Bioenvironmental Engineering prior to granting final
      approval or disapproval for alternate locations.
   5.3. Jacking Operations. Supervisor will contact AMOC and/or pro super for permission to
   perform aircraft jacking operations outside. No aircraft jacking is permitted on F1 and F9,
   and jacking on F2–F8 may only be authorized when no other approved locations are
   available. Jacking on F-row (flight prep area) should be limited to tire removal and
   replacement, all other requests require pro super authorization and must be coordinated
   through AMOC. Aircraft adjacent to a jacked aircraft on spots F2–F8 will be repositioned in
   the taxilane prior to engine start. Supervisors will familiarize themselves with the appropriate
 4                                                       ROBINSAFBI21-116 12 APRIL 2011


     technical order for the aircraft involved. Supervisors will provide AMOC and/or pro super
     the aircraft serial number, parking location, duration the aircraft will be on jacks, and if
     sufficient tie downs are available. Ensure the location has sufficient tie-downs or limit the
     time an aircraft can be on jacks in case of wind. Supervisors will obtain a weather report
     before jacking. When specifications for wind velocity for a particular aircraft are not
     available, maintenance personnel will accept a velocity of 15 miles per hour as the safe
     maximum for outside jacking operations as required by AFOSHSTD 91-100, Aircraft Flight
     Line-Ground Operations and Activities. Once AMOC/pro super concurs, they must contact
     AM Ops for final concurrence.
     5.4. Crane Operations. Supervisors will provide AMOC the aircraft serial number and
     parking location prior to commencing, and upon completion, of any crane operation.

     6.1. Prescribed Forms:
         No forms prescribed.
