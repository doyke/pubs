This instruction implements AFPD 90-4, Relations With Congress, by providing guidance and procedures
for Air Force Reserve personnel who interact with members of Congress. This publication does not apply
to programs within the active component or Air National Guard.



1. HQ USAF Responsibilities:
   1.1. Reserve Policy Integration Division (HQ USAF/REI):
       1.1.1. Develop, coordinate, and provide information on Air Force Reserve legislative program.
       1.1.2. Ensure accuracy and consistency of all Air Force Reserve information intended for Con-
       gress.
       1.1.3. Maintain information concerning Air Force Reserve and Air Force key issues, key mes-
       sages, and white papers.
       1.1.4. Keep senior staff advised of legislative and Congressional budgetary issues.
       1.1.5. Provide guidance on an appropriate schedule of events for Congressional visits.
   1.2. Public Affairs Division (HQ USAF/REL):
       1.2.1. Provide guidance on media coverage.
       1.2.2. Monitor compliance of photographs during Congressional visits with Office of Legislative
       Liaison (SAF/LL) or Office of Budget and Appropriations Liaison (SAF/FML).

2. HQ Air Force Reserve Command and HQ Air Reserve Personnel Center, O ffices of Pub lic
Affairs Responsibilities:
   2.1. Monitor the execution of a Congressional visit.
   2.2. Assist with senior staff responsibilities, as appropriate.

3. Senior Staff (or Designated Representative) Responsibilities:
   3.1. Arrange visits with members of Congress. Invitations may be for specific events or an open invi-
   tation at the legislator’s convenience (see Attachment 2, Attachment 3, and Attachment 4). The
   invitation should not offer transportation (unless prior approval has been granted by SAF/LL). If a
   Congressional member is not available, invite the key local staff person or military legislative assis-
   tant. Senior staff should be proactive in scheduling visits to Congressional member’s district, state, or
   Washington DC offices to coincide with business conducted in the vicinity.
       3.1.1. For specific events comply with AFI 90-401, Air Force Relations With Congress, guide-
       lines which require providing SAF/LL the signed invitation and explanatory cover letter 60 days
       in advance of the visit or event (info HQ USAF/REI, SAF/FML, and either HQ AFRC/PA and
       appropriate NAF/CC or HQ ARPC/PA). These offices will keep senior leadership informed as
       necessary. Include subjects of significant interest or contention. The advance notice is especially
       important when it involves a request to provide transportation for the legislator. If 60 days notice
       is not possible, call SAF/LL to determine the best method of invitation.
       3.1.2. When a Congressional member or staffer accepts an open invitation to visit your unit,
       ensure HQ USAF/REI is aware of the pending visit (info SAF/LL, SAF/FML, the appropriate
       NAF commander and either HQ AFRC/PA or HQ ARPC/PA). HQ USAF/REI may assist or offer
       advice and will keep senior leadership informed as necessary. Likewise, you should advise of any
       subjects of special interest or contention to HQ USAF/REI (see Attachment 5).
       3.1.3. Coordinate with host base commander, Protocol Office, and Public Affairs on visits, if
       applicable.
       3.1.4. Use Suggested Agenda for Congressional Visit (see Attachment 6) when planning the visit
       schedule.
       3.1.5. Notify local Military Affairs Committee and professional military organizations of Con-
       gressional visits.
       3.1.6. Notify Congressional members within the local district when Congressional members from
       outside the district are invited to visit.
       3.1.7. Complete a summary of visit or interaction and provide to HQ USAF/REI with an informa-
       tion copy to HQ AFRC/PA. An example of the type of information requested is on the HQ USAF/
       RE Congressional Interaction Feedback Survey, RCS HAF-REI (AR9719) (see Attachment 7).
       NOTE: This report is designated emergency status code D-Immediately discontinue reporting
       data requirements during emergency conditions. Also discontinue reporting during MINIMIZE.
   3.2. Coordinate written correspondence and verbal contact with members of Congress and their staffs
   to HQ USAF/RE Deputy with information copies to HQ USAF/REI and AFRC/CV or HQ ARPC/CC.
   3.3. Distribute pertinent Reserve information to include unit newspaper, activities, and ceremonies to
   Congressional member’s district offices on a recurring basis.

4. Legislative Liaison Guidance. The success of Air Force Reserve programs and missions depends on
Congressional support. Therefore, effective communication with Congress is essential. It is important that


                                                 2
we as representatives of the Air Force Reserve increase congressional awareness of the Air Force
Reserve’s role in our national security.

5. Briefing Topics. Whenever possible, use “hands-on” demonstrations rather than formal briefings to
display unit mission capabilities. Avoid long detailed briefings to Congressional members and their staff
which focus on the "nuts and bolts" of daily operations; this kind of information is better provided in fact
sheets. Instead, emphasize the AF Reserve basic mission, the organizational mission, economic impact,
number of jobs provided, dollar value of hardware and real estate, local Reservists who are prominent in
the community, and important issues. Remember you cannot ask for help or lobby on any issue, only
report the facts and state the mission requirements. Do not represent your own personal interests.
Always provide honest answers and do not promise anything you can’t deliver. Also, do not disclose
classified information or locally sensitive information on changes in the status of Air Force units, instal-
lations and industrial facilities, without the consent of the Secretary of the Air Force. Include in any brief-
ings or discussions, the following:
   5.1. Wing mission briefing.
   5.2. OPTEMPO and PERSTEMPO update.
   5.3. The cost effectiveness of the Air Force Reserve.
   5.4. Air Force Reserve Key Issues (located on the internet at http//www.afres.af.mil/).
   5.5. Emphasize overall Reserve, as well as local unit, ground, and flying safety record.
   5.6. Level of local organization support for active component.
   5.7. Facts on how congressional actions have locally affected the Reserve or your organization.

6. Handouts. Senior staff should provide visiting members of Congress and their staffers fact books con-
taining pertinent information on their unit and the Air Force Reserve. Fact sheets are available from the
unit Public Affairs Office, HQ AFRC/PA and HQ ARPC/PA, or the internet at http//www.afres.af.mil/.
Commanders should consider providing the following information as deemed appropriate for the visit:
   6.1. United States Air Force Reserve Fact Sheet.
       6.1.1. Air Force Reserve Facts and Figures.
       6.1.2. Women in the Air Force Reserve Fact Sheet.
       6.1.3. Air Force Reserve Historical Milestones Fact Sheet.
   6.2. Organization history or fact sheet.
   6.3. Contingency/humanitarian support participation point paper.
   6.4. Environmental issues point paper.
   6.5. Local economic impact point paper (use AFRC/FM data).
   6.6. Local community relations/community involvement point paper.
   6.7. Training by-products point paper.

7. Mementos/Gifts. As with other distinguished visitors it may be appropriate to provide a visiting mem-
ber of Congress with some modest memento that complies with regulatory guidance. Unit or Air Force

                                                  3
Reserve specific items such as ball caps, pens, decals, notepads, bumper stickers, coasters, coffee cups,
patches, organizational plaques, T-shirts etc., may be appropriate. Do not purchase special items as a
one-time gift. A good rule of thumb is that any item you have on hand and normally would give to a dis-
tinguished visitor is appropriate, however, consult with your servicing Judge Advocate to ensure compli-
ance with regulatory guidance. The presentation should be made at the end of the visit.

                     SUGGESTED AGENDA FOR CONGRESSIONAL VISIT
- Congressional party arrives at organization unit/base and is met by Senior Staff.
- Non-sectarian prayer breakfast or professional organization hosted lunch.

when possible and appropriate under governing policies and procedures.
- Inspect equipment and discuss related issues.

TIPS:
   • Review Congressional member’s biography and identify his or her concerns. Biographies are
      available from the Internet at http//www.access.gpo.gov/.
   • Be considerate of your visitors. Schedule refreshments and break times. Avoid overscheduling.
      Keep briefings interesting and focused, and stay on time.
   • You only have a limited amount of time available, so carefully plan what essential information the
      member should receive and the most effective way it should be presented.
   • If the schedule supports a social activity such as a meal, commanders should consider having a
      cross-section of the member’s constituency present. The member should be informed of those
      attending the social activity
   • Notify local Military Affairs Committee and professional military organizations (such as Reserve
      Officers Association, Air Force Association, etc.) of Congressional visits. They may be in a posi-
      tion to contribute facilities and resources for the event. Use civic tours to reciprocate and gain
      community support for the Reserve Activity.
   • Closing commander comments should include thanks for support in the past or state that you look
      forward to future support. Express appreciation for support of HQ AFRC/CC and encourage
      member to meet the Commander in Washington.
   • When preparing for the visit consider flightline greetings, welcome marquee, facility clean-up,
      security escorts and bomb sweeps, static displays, reserved parking and special communications
      requirements. Schedule visits during UTAs, IDTs or other Reserve duty when possible.
