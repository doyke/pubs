SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.         Updates
functional names and office symbols throughout publication.
1. Background. The majority of the solid waste generated at Yokota Air Base (AB) is
incinerated. This method of disposal is not common on Air Force installations, and requires
special handling of all solid waste. The procedures in this instruction are based on the unique
conditions at Yokota AB.

Terms
Collection Station—A designated place on an installation where refuse may be conveniently
and efficiently assembled and stored in a container for collection. Recyclable materials are
separated from non-recyclables at this point.
Contract Waste—Waste generated by contracts. Contractors are required to haul waste off base
and dispose of it IAW Japanese regulations.
Debris—Burnable and non-burnable waste, such as ashes, waste materials generated by
construction, maintenance or repair work, and leaves and tree trimmings.
Garbage—Animal and vegetable waste generated by handling, preparation, cooking, and
serving of foods.
Hazardous Waste—Any waste that requires greater handling care during disposal than other
waste. Examples are toxic, poisonous, corrosive, irritating, radioactive, biologically infectious,
explosive, or flammable waste that presents a significant hazard to human health and the
environment. Excluded from this definition are domestic sewage sludge, household wastes and
medical wastes. Refer to Yokota AB Hazardous Waste Management Plan for further guidance.
Household Hazardous Materials or Waste—Products used around the home that contain
hazardous substances. Such products may include paints, stains and varnishes, car and
household batteries, cleaners, aerosols, adhesives, motor oil, and pesticides. The used or leftover
contents of such products may create a potential risk to people and the environment.
Pollution Prevention (P2) and Hazardous Material Management Process (HMMP) Cross
Functional Team (CFT)—The team discusses QRP, Hazardous Waste Management,
Opportunity Assessment, Energy Conservation, and Hazardous Material Management Process.
QRP—A recycling program that distributes proceeds pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2577 and requires
concerted efforts to:
 6                                                                 374AWI32-7001 2 MAY 2012


 Divert or recover scrap or waste from waste streams.
 Identify, segregate, and maintain the integrity of the recyclable materials to maintain or enhance
the marketability of the materials. If the program is administered by a DoD Component, a QRP
includes adherence to a control process providing accountability for all materials processed
through program operations.
Recyclable Materials—Materials that have been or would be discarded, and that may be reused
after undergoing some type of physical or chemical processing. Recyclable materials do not
include ships, planes, or any discarded material that must undergo demilitarization or demolition
prior to sale. Refer to Attachment 2 of this instruction for detailed categories of recyclable
materials.
Recycling—The process by which recovered materials are transformed into usable products.
Refuse—Garbage, debris, discarded solid materials, and other waste, including those generated
by commercial, housing, and community activities. However, refuse does not include
explosives, incendiaries, classified material, radioactive material, and liquid waste.
Solid Waste—Garbage, refuse, sludge, and other discarded materials, including solid, semi-
solid, liquid, and contained gaseous materials resulting from industrial and commercial
operations or community and residential activities. Solid Waste also contains household
hazardous items. It does not include solids or dissolved material in domestic sewage or other
significant pollutants in water resources, such as silt, dissolved or suspended solids in industrial
wastewater effluent, dissolved materials in irrigation return flows or other common water
pollutants.
Solid Waste Management—The purposeful and systematic control of storage, collection,
transportation, processing, and disposal of solid waste.
Source Separation—The separation of solid waste at generation point by the generator.

                            YOKOTA RECYCLING PROGRAM

A2.1. Solid Waste Categories. Solid wastes are separated into five categories: recyclables,
paper products, household hazardous waste, bulky waste, and non-recyclables. The more
recyclables that are separated at the source, the more economical it is to recycle. All items
should be put in a bag or box. Each bag or box can contain a mixture of items from one
category. For example, "Recyclables" such as glass, cans, and metals can be put in one bag or
box. For more information, call the 374 CES/CEAN at 225-5271.

tape per United States post office guidelines. If the cartridge was used for "Official
Governmental Business," take it to your orderly room or Post Office (call the 374 CS Base
Information Transfer Center [BITC] [374 CS/SCXM] at pick up desk or 225-8707).
