the State of NM. The focus will always be on the child’s safety, and involved parties will be
sensitive to the traumatic nature of such actions. After hours, contact the CYFD for assistance

removed from the home. These procedures shall be outlined in the MOU between KAFB and

Potentially Disqualifying Information (PDI) will be reported to the Competent Medical
Authority (CMA) and then forwarded to the unit CC. If a family with a PRP member is enrolled
in the New Parent Support Program, FAP staff will consult with CMA to determine if reporting
is required, on a case-by-case basis. The current Mental Health Flight FAP PRP checklists will
be followed.
