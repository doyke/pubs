SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.


1. General.
   1.1. Radioactive materials and ionizing radiation producing devices have many beneficial uses in
   industrial applications, construction, armament development/testing and research. Such materials and
   equipment may be directly or indirectly hazardous to personnel by virtue of their potential to cause
   serious biological damage to body tissues and organs, and are of significant concern with respect to
   protection of the environment. Federal regulations set specific limits for exposure to ionizing radiation
   (or dose equivalent), which include keeping all exposures ALARA. When the term “base” is used in
   this instruction, it includes all areas under Travis control or jurisdiction unless otherwise noted.

Terms
Abnormal Exposure—An exposure received in any monitoring period that, if continued at the same rate
would exceed the limits specified in 10 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Determine an abnormal
exposure dose equivalent by dividing the applicable (stochastic or nonstochastic) annual limit by the
number of monitoring periods during the year. For stochastic exposures, an abnormal exposure is 417
TRAVISAFBI48-105 4 AUGUST 2004                                                                         11


millirem (mrem) [4.2 milliSievert (mSv)] for any monthly monitoring period and 1250 mrem (12.5 mSv)
for any quarterly monitoring period.
ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) Program—A set of management and administrative
actions taken to reduce personnel radiation exposures to as low as reasonably achievable. The ALARA
concept was developed in response to scientific evidence that suggests that no level of ionizing radiation
exposure is totally risk free.
ALARA Action Level—Locally established radiation exposure limits for personnel dosimetry results
that are less than the Air Force established criteria used to flag exposures that are above normal, higher
than expected or could potentially result in an abnormal exposure if trends continue. Informal
investigation is conducted by permit RSO to determine the specifics of the exposure, such as change in
workload, tasks, or position. Results are reported to the Radiation Safety Committee.
Area TLD Monitor—Person assigned by the unit or section responsible for enforcing OI/STDs of the
TLD program for that unit or area.
TLD -Thermoluminescent Dosimeter—The personnel dosimeter is used to indicate a close
approximation of the exposure dose to ionizing radiation to ensure exposures are maintained ALARA.
The badge contains a thermoluminescent dosimetry packet. The packet is exchanged monthly or quarterly
depending on the area where an individual works.
Pregnant Worker Action Level—Personnel dosimetry result which, if continued for the term of
pregnancy, would exceed the 500 mrem/9 month’s exposure limit for the fetus. This equates to
approximately 55 mrem on a monthly TLD.

   accompany the Agreement State license. The license must either specifically list the installation or
   grant approval for work at temporary job sites anywhere in the United States where the NRC or
   Agreement State has jurisdiction.
NOTE: Operations on property that is not exclusive federal jurisdiction will need to pay reciprocity.
Likewise, State licensees may not work on Air Force or other installations where exclusive federal juris-
diction exists unless pre-coordinated and reciprocity is paid to the NRC.
   EXCEPTION: Contractors using generally licensed materials (e.g., certain NITON Lead Paint Ana-
   lyzers) and DoE or DoE prime contractors operating in accordance with 10 CFR Part 835 do not
   require an NRC license or NRC Form 241. However, Base RSO must receive written certification
   from DoE organizations or DoE prime contractors that they are exempt from NRC license require-
   ments.

                CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS UNDER AF RAM LICENSES

A4.1. Contractors organizations performing services involving use of RAM or ionizing radiation produc-
ing device (RPD) under the auspices of the an AF permit or using AF owned equipment.

A4.2. Contractor shall maintain all occupational health support to employees, specifically use of person-
nel dosimeters, health risk assessment measurement except those pertaining to public dose or AF/govern-
ment employee exposure, occupation health physicals, training and personal protective equipment such as
lead aprons. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis when coordinated and approved by 60
AMDS/SGPB.

A4.3. Contractor shall appoint and obtain Unit RSO training for an individual in their organization to
serve as Unit RSO.

A4.4. Contractor will maintain permit folder as described in Unit RSO training and in USAF RM permit.
Specifically, contractor will ensure records are maintained in an orderly fashion as required by permit and
kept on hand as required by AFI 40-201 Attachment 11, and must include:
   A4.4.1. Inventories with explanation for all changes between inventories.
   A4.4.2. Shipment paperwork. Ensure no RM shipments are accepted unless the Base RSO has con-
   firmed you can accept them, they are not leaking, and that they confirm to Department of Transporta-
   tion regulations. (EXCEPTION: shipping documents are not required on the base proper.)
   A4.4.3. Leak test results or letters referencing such results.
   A4.4.4. Confirmation of annual training.
   A4.4.5. Letters of Appointment for Unit and Permit RSO signed by the permit holder.

A4.5. In addition to local inspections, the Air Force level agencies must inspect permit holders for com-
pliance with statements made in their permit application, conditions listed on the permit, Air Force direc-
tives and instructions, and applicable NRC and DoT regulations in 10 CFR and 49 CFR. The NRC may
also conduct no-notice inspection and enforces administrative actions, fines, and criminal penalties
against the Air Force or individuals as described in 10 CFR Part 2, Rules of Practice for Domestic Licens-
ing Proceedings and Issuance of Orders. Appendix C, General Statement of Policy and Procedure for
NRC Enforcement Actions, describes NRC’s enforcement policy and the various enforcement options
NRC may exercise.

A4.6. Therefore, at least one contract monitor will complete radiation safety officer training to ensure
competence in review of permit compliance. This training may be obtained through a civilian course or
the AF RSO on-line training course B6RSOM, DITIS Registration #77700150 through the Base Educa-
tion Office.

A4.7. Contract monitor will incorporate permit requirements into contract performance audits.
