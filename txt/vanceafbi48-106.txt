This instruction implements AFPD 48-1, Aerospace Medical Program, and establishes the
procedures and responsibilities for the 29 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) 1910.1200, Hazard
Communications. This standard requires that each work area maintain the following: hazardous
chemical inventory, Material Safety Data Sheets on all items included in the hazardous materials
inventory, a list of all non-routine tasks involving hazardous materials, and a description of any
contracted services involving the use of hazardous materials. It applies to all Air Force civilian
and military personnel whether assigned as permanent party or in transition (i.e., TDY). Ensure
that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and are disposed
of in accordance with the Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Air
Force         Records          Disposition         Schedule        (RDS)          located        at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cft.         Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF
Form 847, Recommendation for Change to Publication; route AF Form 847 from the field
through the VAFB Publications and Forms Manager. (AF Form 847 is prescribed in AFI 11-
215, USAF Flight Manuals Program [FMP]. Refer to that publication for guidance on filling
out the form.)
