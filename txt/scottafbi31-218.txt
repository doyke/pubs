                                             Chapter 1

                                         INTRODUCTION

1.1. Program Management. The Scott AFB Vehicle Traffic Code is hereby established and
applies to all vehicles and vehicle operators within the geographical limits of Scott AFB, Illinois.
Non-uniform law and ordinances are a source of inconvenience and hazard to motorists and
pedestrians, which contribute to traffic snarls, accidents, and congestion; increase the
administrative burdens of government agencies, and even more important raise serious barriers
to mobility and commerce. In recognition of these problems and in the National Committee on
Uniform Traffic Laws and Ordinances, there should be one comprehensive traffic law that does
not conflict, duplicate, nor cover any matter adequately encompassed in a state vehicle code
provision. Certain exclusions to the foregoing policy are necessary to be included in this
instruction for compliance with current military directives, and where necessary, to lend local
emphasis for safety and efficient highway travel. However, any revision of this instruction must
include thorough consideration of all existing rules, directives, and command policy to the
degree that essential functions are properly synchronized and reflect reasonableness and
uniformity where possible. Other traffic ordinance, new or revised, enacted by the State of
Illinois that is not specifically cited will be effective on the date of enactment or publication as
provided by the State of Illinois. The invalidity of any provision of this instruction shall not
affect the validity of the remainder of this instruction. Nothing in this instruction shall be
construed to conflict with existing military directives. Where conflict exists, military directives
will govern.

   AFB. The devices complete a self-test to determine if they are operational or not. Preventive
   maintenance is conducted by the Illinois State Police. If for any reason the device is non-
   operational it must be sent back to the manufacturer for repair.
   4.27.2. The person was lawfully stopped on the installation while in control or driving a

                                           Chapter 5

               DRIVING RECORDS AND THE TRAFFIC POINT SYSTEM

5.1. Driving Records. The AF Form 1315, Accident Report or local program will be used to
record vehicle traffic accidents, moving and parking violations, suspension or revocation actions,
and traffic- point assessments involving military and civilian personnel, their family members,
and other personnel operating motor vehicles on Scott AFB.
   5.1.1. Suspension/Revocation of Driving Privileges. (See Attachment 7 of this instruction.)
   5.1.2. Point assessment for moving violations. (See Attachment 8 of this instruction.)
5.2. Traffic Citation Rebuttal Procedures. The action authority for traffic citations is
delegated to the unit commander of the alleged offender. The unit commander will annotate
action taken, if any, on the traffic citation. This policy does not restrict first sergeants from
performing and signing for action taken on the traffic citations of enlisted members of the unit
who choose not to rebut the citation. Members who rebut citations will prepare a written
statement detailing the circumstances surrounding the issuance of the citation and why he/she
believes the violation should be dismissed. If the unit commander agrees, the commander will
forward information to the security forces, reports, and analysis section. Reports and analysis
personnel will obtain a written statement from the patrol person issuing the citation and forward
the information to the 375 SFS/CC. If the 375 SFS/CC feels the citation was in error, the process
will end there. However, if the 375 SFS/CC feels the citation should stand, all information will
be forwarded to the installation military magistrate, who will in turn, determine the guilt or
innocence. The magistrate will be the final authority.
5.3. Non-moving Violations. The provisions listed below apply to citations issued by security
forces via DD Form 1805, DD Form 1408, and DD Forms 1408 issued by parking wardens.
Non-moving citations issued outside the jurisdiction of Scott AFB are not considered under the
accumulative provision listed below. When the operator is unidentified, the registered owner
will be cited for the nonmoving violation, unless a written statement is provided within 5
workdays from the date of the citation by the registered owner that another individual was
operating the motor vehicle and concurrence of that individual is reflected on the written
statement. In this case, the 375 SFS/CC will evaluate the citation and cite the responsible
individual. For GOVs, the responsible identified operator will be cited under this paragraph.
The following mandatory administrative actions, in addition to any appropriate disciplinary
action by the respective commander, will be taken when persons subject to this instruction have
accumulated the number of nonmoving violations indicated during a 12-month period.
   5.3.1. Third nonmoving violation: Suspended from driving on base for 30 days.
   5.3.2. Fourth nonmoving violation: Suspended from driving on base for 6 months.
   5.3.3. Fifth nonmoving violation: Suspended from driving on base indefinitely.
   5.3.4. First handicap violation: Warning letter sent to the individual concerned.
   5.3.5. Second handicap violation: 60-day suspension of on-base driving privileges.
   5.3.6. Third handicap violation: 1-year suspension of on-base driving privileges.

   5.3.7. It is the responsibility of the vehicle operator to ensure all occupants are using seat
   belts and/or child restraint devices. Failure to use seat belts and/or child restraints while the
   vehicle is in motion will result in the following actions against the vehicle operator:
       5.3.7.1. First offense: Mandatory counseling by assigned unit.
       5.3.7.2. Second offense: 30-day suspension of on-base driving privileges.
       5.3.7.3. Third offense: 6-month suspension of on-base driving privileges.
       5.3.7.4. Fourth offense: 1-year revocation of on-base driving privileges.
       5.3.7.5. Security force units has developed local procedures to develop a Parking
       Warden program. Parking Wardens must be delegated by individual unit commanders, in
       writing, for participation in the program. SFAR/S5SC will obtain a letter with the current
       monitors and maintain the letter on file. The letter should specify a minimum of one
       primary and alternate in the grade of E-5 or above. Parking Wardens are the
       commander‗s representative to issue citations for parking violations in areas under the
       control of their commander. Wardens will issue parking tickets via DD Form 1408.
       5.3.7.6. Parking wardens will be trained by security forces personnel on the correct way
       to complete DD Forms 1408. The main difference between a DD Form 1408 issued by a
       security forces member and one issued by a parking warden is the special instructions on
       the back of the pink copy that directs the violator to contact the parking warden who
       issued the ticket instead of SFS/S5R. It is important that parking wardens include how or
       where they can be reached by the violators. When contacted by the violator, the parking
       warden will fill in any missing data in sections 1-10. Tickets that are incomplete, over
       30-days old or were written by personnel not designated as parking wardens will not be
       processed and will be returned to the unit with no action taken by security forces.
   5.3.8. Vehicle operators are prohibited from using cellular phones while operating a motor
   vehicle without the use of a hands-free device. This stipulation includes text messaging
   which is defined as any action involving reading from or entering data into any handheld or
   other electronic device, including for the purpose of SMS texting, e-mailing, instant
   messaging, obtaining navigational information, or engaging in any other form of electronic
   data retrieval or electronic data communication. Failure to comply with this rule while
   driving will result in the following actions against the vehicle operator:
       5.3.8.1. First offense: Mandatory counseling by assigned unit.
       5.3.8.2. Second offense: 30-day suspension of on-base driving privileges.
       5.3.8.3. Third offense: 6-month suspension of on-base driving privileges.
       5.3.8.4. Fourth offense: 1-year revocation of on-base driving privileges.
5.4. Moving Violations. The following actions will be taken on the accumulation of identified
number of points:
   5.4.1. Accumulation of six to 11 Traffic Points. An advisory email will be forwarded with
   read receipt to the individual through his/her unit first sergeant. The unit commander or
   civilian supervisor will counsel the individual on the penalties that could be imposed on
   them.
SCOTTAFBI31-218 12 JULY 2012                                                             39


  5.4.2. Accumulation of 12 or more traffic points. When 12 or more traffic points are
  accumulated within 12 months (1 continuous year), the person‘s driving privileges will be
  suspended for a period of 6 months.

                                           Chapter 6

                    IMPOUNDING PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLES

6.1. Abandoned Vehicles. A POV is deemed abandoned if left unattended for a period of 5
days. Note: If a vehicle is in the long-term parking lot with the appropriate security forces
paperwork displayed in the windshield it is not considered abandoned UNLESS it is 10 or more
duty days after the owner was supposed to have returned and the owner has not made contact
with security forces to request an extension.
   6.1.1. Once the vehicle has been identified as abandoned, DD Form 1408 will be issued.
   The pink copy will be affixed to the vehicle. If after 72 hours, the vehicle has not moved or
   the owner/operator has not contacted a law enforcement official, a DD Form 2504,
   Abandoned Vehicle Notice, will be placed in the protective plastic, along with DD Form
   1408. An additional 72 hours will be given to the owner/operator to remove the vehicle or
   correct the violation. The instructions listed on DD Form 2504 must include contacting SF
   Investigations who is the focal point for abandoned vehicles. The original and second copy
   of the DD Form 2504, the yellow and white copy of the DD Form 1408, along with a Law
   Enforcement Agencies Data System printout, will be given to Investigations for further
   processing.
   6.1.2. Removal. Investigations will accomplish a DD Form 2505, Abandoned Vehicle
   Removal authorization, and a DD Form 2506, Vehicle Impoundment Report. A final attempt
   to contact the owner will be made via certified mail. If the certified mail is returned, the on-
   call tow company will be contacted and arrangements for the tow will be made.
   6.1.3. If the owner is identified after his/her vehicle is towed, that owner will be responsible
   for the necessary expenditures to the tow company in order to retrieve his/her vehicle.
   6.1.4. If the current location of a POV hinders safety, mission requirements, or tow-away
   zone, and must be relocated without delay, make all feasible attempts to locate the
   owner/operator of the vehicle. If contact cannot be made, the 375th Logistics Readiness
   Squadron or a commercial towing company will be contacted to tow the vehicle to a
   specified location. All costs for the towing and any damage caused to the vehicle will be
   incurred by the owner of the vehicle.

6. Excessive parking and other non-moving violations as covered under paragraph 2.5.1.1.1. of
this instruction.
Notes:
1. When imposing a suspension or revocation because of an off-installation offense, the
effective date is the same as the date of civil conviction or the suspension or revocation date of
state or host nation driving privileges. This effective date can be retroactive.
2. No points are assessed solely for revocation or suspension actions. Except for implied
consent violations, base revocations on a conviction by a civilian court, military court-martial,
and nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the UCMJ or a separate hearing as otherwise
addressed in this instruction. If revocation for implied consent is combined with another
revocation, such as 1 year for intoxicated driving, revocations may run consecutively (total of 24
months) or concurrently (total of 12 months). Apply the Installation Commander‘s policy
systematically and not on a case-by-case basis.
