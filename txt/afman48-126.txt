                                           Chapter 1

                                  PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Purpose. This Manual establishes a process to provide equipment standards and equipment
modernization for the BE career field. Establishing common BE equipment standards across the
AF will minimize logistics support and training requirements. This process will provide a
logical path to improved equipment management and allow the Air Force to maximize the
execution of program funds.
1.2. Objectives.
   1.2.1. Consistent delivery of a common set of mission capabilities across all BE
   flights/elements in both garrison and deployed environments.
   1.2.2. Establishment of a common process that will ensure all equipment actions impacting
   the BE career field are coordinated and approved by the Associate Chief, Bioenvironmental
   Engineering (AF/SG3PB).
   1.2.3. Capitalize on the Unit Type Code (UTC) and Allowance Standard (AS)-driven
   standards where available.
   1.2.4. Reduce training required when Airmen change stations and deploy.
   1.2.5. Reduce the approval and processing time as well as costs associated with the purchase
   of new equipment.
1.3. Components.
   1.3.1. Equipment Standards. Establishment of common equipment standards allows trained
   BE professionals to execute capabilities through a common set of equipment without the
   additional burden of training on “local” equipment sets. This also supports the BE strategic
   objective of “garrison = deployed” by allowing BE personnel to deliver a common set of
   mission capabilities worldwide. This Manual does not change the UTC or AS management
   processes, but incorporates them into a common process to ensure all equipment actions
   impacting the BE career field are coordinated and approved by AF/SG3PB. UTC and AS
   equipment form a baseline or foundation for equipment standards.
   1.3.2. Modernization. This Manual will establish a modernization process for equipment
   upgrade/replacement efforts when existing equipment is no longer capable of supporting BE
   capabilities. Specific considerations for upgrade/replacement can be found in AFI 41-201.
   The modernization process must also consider the entire Doctrine, Organization, Training,
   Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) spectrum. It also
   applies to equipment that is being replaced due to exceeding its recognized service life (life-
   cycle).
1.4. Scope. BE flights, elements, and program offices that work with Defense Health Program
(DHP) funded equipment and 886H/deployable UTC allowance standard equipment will follow
the requirements of this Manual and SEL when purchasing, upgrading, replacing or increasing
capabilities of BE equipment.

                                        PROCEDURES

3.1. Guidance. BE Flights/Elements will request equipment on the SEL. Flights/Elements can
nominate equipment for replacement due to age, technology advancement, or mission change.
Flights/Elements that wish to nominate equipment for consideration shall use the process
described in this Manual. Migration to a common set of equipment standards is expected to occur
mainly through attrition. Although the goal is for all BE Flights/Elements to have the same
equipment, there is no specified acquisition authority or funding stream identified for a
wholesale replacement of operational in-garrison equipment. Flights/Elements will continue to
use current serviceable equipment until replacement is required. Over time, the BE enterprise
will move to a single set of common equipment standards.
3.2. SEL. The SEL identifies equipment designed to enable flights/elements to meet a
capability. The SEL is a list of BE equipment common to UTC and 886H allowance standards
and the in-garrison DHP equipment inventory. The list is approved for the request of equipment
to meet BE mission requirements.
   3.2.1. The SEL will include the following data elements: national stock number (NSN) (if
   available), manufacturer and model/part number, device code and level of applicability (AF-
   wide, UTC, or Allowance Standard), estimated cost, salient characteristics, and contract
   number (if available).
   3.2.2. SEL data will be used to populate appropriate data fields in DMLSS, TIGERS and/or
   AF Forms 601, Equipment Action Request, for equipment ordering.
   3.2.3. BE Flights/Elements are authorized to locally request consumables, parts, supplies,
   software, and/or accessories that directly support the equipment items on the SEL.
   3.2.4. BE EWG will include equipment identified in support of a UTC or the Home Station
   Medical Response (HSMR) 886H AS on the SEL.
   3.2.5. The      SEL      will   be   maintained    on    the          BE     SharePoint      site
   (https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-SG-AF-06/default.aspx).
3.3. Procedure for Adding New Items to the SEL. The procedure for adding new equipment
items to the SEL is outlined below. Refer to the equipment nomination process diagram at
Attachment 4.
   3.3.1. Nomination. BE Flight/Element Commanders will nominate new equipment items to
   their MAJCOM/SGPB. The MAJCOM/SGPB will utilize internal processes to determine if
   the nomination is a reasonable proposal prior to approving and forwarding the nomination to
   the BE EWG. Nominations will be made on the equipment purchase nomination template
   (Attachment 2). Nominations originating above base-level should follow the same path to
   ensure sufficient level of review is accomplished.
       3.3.1.1. Literature Review. A literature review will be completed by the individual
       nominating the equipment item prior to submission to the MAJCOM/SGPB for
       consideration. This step includes conducting online research, as well as contacting the
       manufacturer directly to obtain the technical specifications, capabilities and limitations of
8                                                            AFMAN48-126 15 AUGUST 2014


       the item. The literature review will be included as an attachment to the nomination
       template which is submitted to the MAJCOM/SGPB.
       3.3.1.2. Rationale. Nominated equipment must be accompanied by a strong supporting
       rationale as to why the existing equipment cannot meet requirements or how the proposed
       new equipment might substantially increase BE operational capabilities. The rationale
       must also describe how the proposed item will fill a specified capability gap.
    3.3.2. Submittal. If the MAJCOM/SGPB agrees with the nomination and confirms that
    equipment on the current SEL cannot meet the stated need, he/she will approve the
    nomination and forward it to the BE EWG.
    3.3.3. Evaluation. BE EWG members will conduct needed research to arrive at an informed
    opinion of the nominated item. An operational review of new equipment must accompany
    items being evaluated to replace existing equipment. Testing/evaluation could be the
    responsibility of several different offices depending on the level required. It is the
    responsibility of the BE EWG to determine the level of testing/evaluation required for each
    nominated item. The results of all evaluations conducted will be made available to relevant
    parties at all echelons. During the evaluation process the BE EWG may consider the initial
    literature review completed by the individual prior to nomination, MAJCOM
    recommendations, a technical evaluation by USAFSAM/OE, a utility evaluation by a field
    unit, an Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) or all of the above.
       3.3.3.1. Market Research. Market research can be conducted at multiple levels of
       consideration. The research will provide market data which could include but is not
       limited to: analysis of available technologies, COTS/Government off-the-shelf (GOTS)
       equipment available, manufacturer business model analysis, and cost/benefit analysis.
       3.3.3.2. Technical Evaluation. Technical evaluations involve analysis of an equipment
       item’s capabilities, limitations and its ability to provide a high level of confidence in the
       data provided. This type of evaluation should also determine the equipment’s salient
       characteristics if not yet determined. This type of evaluation will be conducted by
       USAFSAM/OE.
       3.3.3.3. Utility Evaluation. A utility evaluation of an equipment item determines its
       ability to fill the stated capability gap, to include a determination of its potential
       effectiveness and suitability in performing the mission. It is a characterization of the
       equipment item based on its ability to meet mission Tactics, Techniques and Procedure
       (TTP) requirements and human performance factors in the planned or expected
       operational environment. This type of evaluation is normally conducted by the Pilot unit
       for UTC items. For items not associated with a UTC, a volunteer unit will be solicited to
       perform this testing.
       3.3.3.4. OT&E. An OT&E is conducted in as realistic an operational environment as
       possible to estimate the prospective item's operational effectiveness, suitability, and
       operational capabilities. In addition, OT&E provides information on organization,
       personnel requirements, doctrine, and tactics. Traditionally this level of testing is
       accomplished through a testing agency such as: Air Force Medical Evaluation Support
       Activity (AFMESA), Air Force Operational Testing Center (AFOTEC), or similar
       organization.
AFMAN48-126 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                     9


  3.3.4. Approval/Rejection Process. The majority of the BE EWG should be in agreement
  with a decision prior to making a recommendation to the BCB. Once the BE EWG has
  concluded its review, the items recommended for inclusion on the SEL will be presented to
  the BCB. This presentation can take place within the context of the next scheduled BCB
  meeting, or through other appropriate venues as necessary. The BCB will review the BE
  EWG recommendation(s) and pass an “approve” or “reject” recommendation to AF/SG3PB
  for final decision. Two possible recommendations to AF/SG3PB are expected:
     3.3.4.1. The item is deemed inappropriate to meet the stated need (i.e., rejected).
     Justification for rejection should be provided upon request.
     3.3.4.2. The item is recommended for approval as a replacement or an addition to the
     SEL.
  3.3.5. Equipment Removal Procedures. There are numerous reasons an equipment item may
  be nominated for removal from the SEL. Such circumstances could include but are not
  limited to: age of the equipment, cost of maintenance, technology advancement,
  replacement, no longer supported by the manufacturer or no longer needed to support BE
  capability execution. Other considerations are outlined in AFI 41-201. Removal of
  equipment from the SEL will follow the same basic procedures outlined in paragraph 3.3,
  however all steps of the process may not be deemed necessary. The BE EWG will determine
  which steps can be omitted in the process.
  3.3.6. Documentation. Once an item is approved or disapproved for the SEL, the BE EWG
  will save all documentation presented during the equipment nomination process in an
  electronic historical file for future reference. Documentation should be maintained for a
  piece of equipment for not less than three years after it is denied for inclusion on or removed
  from the SEL.
