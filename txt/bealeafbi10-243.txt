SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Significant revisions
include the addition of responsibilities for squadron commanders, servicing manpower office
representative, 9 RW/CCE, supervisors, augmentees, and provide specific guidance for those
additional responsibilities. Revisions also clarify both the WAP activation process and
Installation Command Center Directive (ICCD) dissemination procedures. Additional revisions
direct the WAP Manager to maintain “fair share” quotas which will no longer be published in
this instruction and establish parameters for tenant unit participation in the WAP.

    2.14. Augmentees.
       2.14.1. Augmentees requiring specialized and/or advanced training will have
       retainability for a minimum of a year.
BEALEAFBI10-243 12 FEBRUARY 2014                                                              9


      2.14.2. Augmentees are responsible for notifying the ARPO and their supervisor, if their
      eligibility to perform the requirement is affected due to PCS, deployment, or any other
      circumstances.
      2.14.3. Augmentees are responsible for retaining any training, qualification or
      certification documentation.
      2.14.4. Augmentees are responsible to maintain a professional attitude while functioning
      as an augmentee.
      2.14.5. Augmentees must become familiar with responsibilities and expectations to
      perform the specific functions.
3. Augmentation Requirements.
   3.1. Establishing and Implementing Augmentation Requirements.
      3.1.1. Local needs and conditions will be used to determine requirements. Augmentees
      are used primarily to support temporary, short-term workload surges during wartime,
      contingency, natural disaster, and exercise situations. Sustained use of augmentees will
      not be used to offset normal manpower shortfalls. Attachments 3 through 15 of this
      instruction identify functional areas supported by the WAP and identify requirements
      such as job description, training, and justification.
      3.1.2. The ARPO will identify processes requiring augmentation and train augmentees to
      perform those duties.
      3.1.3. Security Forces, Contamination Control Area (CCA), ICC/Crisis Action Team
      (CAT) Admin, Cargo Deployment Quick Fix Team, Readiness Support Team (RST),
      Emergency Operations (EOC) Admin, and Deployment Control Center (DCC) Admin
      taskings require individuals with extensive training prior to a required activation of the
      WAP.
      3.1.4. A pool of individuals larger than actual requirements will be trained and
      monitored by each group to ensure the required number of individuals is available despite
      AEF rotations, TDYs, leaves, etc.
      3.1.5. Taskings will be rotated between units every 6 months during longer augmentation
      requirements.
   3.2. Quotas.
      3.2.1. The goal of this process is to ensure quotas assigned are based on an accurate
      reflection of resources available.
      3.2.2. Group “fair share” quotas will be based on each group’s percentage of available
      personnel and will be established using a formula agreed upon by the ARB (Figures 3.1.
      and 3.2). Quota numbers are adjusted to offset decimal place results in computations.
 10                                               BEALEAFBI10-243 12 FEBRUARY 2014


Figure 3.1. Group’s “Fair Share” Quota Computation.




Figure 3.2. SFS Augmentation.




Figure 3.3. Group Number Available.




         3.2.2.1. The number of requirements and the quotas associated with the requirements
         will be looked at on an annual basis by the ARB.
         3.2.2.2. If there is a significant change in a group’s number of “availables”, forward
         the change to 9 RW/XP for re-computation.
         3.2.2.3. Quotas are levied against the groups. When a requirement is activated it is
         the group’s responsibility for meeting the quota.
      3.2.2.4. Quotas will be maintained by the WAP Manager and available on the 9 RW/XP
      SharePoint.
      3.2.3. Exemptions.
         3.2.3.1. Average number of deployed personnel. To ensure that each unit’s quota
         takes into account that at any given time there are personnel serving outside the base,
         the unit availability numbers will reflect actual manning less an average number of
         personnel TDY, based on the deployment history from the previous year. The ARB
         chairman will approve the final number of exempted personnel by group.
         3.2.3.2. Functionally Employed Personnel. Individuals already performing the tasks
         as part of their functional responsibilities (i.e. SFS personnel for Security Forces
         Augmentation).
         3.2.3.3. Regulatory positions that preclude the performance of additional duties as
         defined by their functional instruction.
         3.2.3.4. Personnel already tasked to support contingency/exercise functions.
         Individuals cannot be available for two taskings to support a particular contingency or
         exercise. For example, a person tasked for SFS augmentation cannot also be tasked
         for Deployment Control Center (DCC) admin.
BEALEAFBI10-243 12 FEBRUARY 2014                                                               11


          3.2.3.5. Variations for the Formula. In some cases, quota assignments are made on a
          practical basis rather than a strict quota. In those instances, they have been annotated
          in attachments 4,7,9,and 13 of this instruction. For example, 9 MSG assumes
          responsibility for providing Readiness Support Team personnel. In exchange,
          adjustments are made to their quota in other augmentation areas.
   3.3. Activation.
      3.3.1. When a situation arises requiring activation of a particular WAP process, the
      ARPO of the functional area to be augmented will draft a request and route it through the
      group commander for validation on the way to the 9 RW/CC as the approval authority
      (Figure 3.3.).
      3.3.1.1. The request will identify the requirement being activated, functional POC,
      numbers of personnel to be tasked and reporting instructions for tasked augmentees.
      Sample requests can be found in Attachment 16 (single request) and Attachment 17
      (multiple requests).
          3.3.1.2. This request must be made as soon as possible.

Figure 3.4. Process for Activation of Requirements.




      3.3.2. If implementation is approved, the ICC/CAT will transmit the ICCD. If the ICC is
      not activated, the 9 RW/CCE or 9 RW/BCP will transmit the approved request depending
      on current circumstances.
          3.3.2.1. The ICCD will be distributed to group commanders and superintendents, 9
          RW/DS and, if applicable, Group Control Centers (GCC) and tenant units.
          3.3.2.2. The ICCD will contain information for individuals on where to report, whom
          to report to, as well as any special reporting instructions.

     3.3.3. Group Superintendents will assign a quota to each squadron as appropriate to meet
     the group’s tasking.
     3.3.4. Unit Augmentation Coordinator will appoint personnel to fill the quota assigned
     by their group and forward the list of individuals to the group for compilation.
     3.3.5. Group Superintendents will compile squadron input and forward to the supported
     group. Courtesy copy the ARPO and the WAP Manager.
     3.3.6. Individual squadron shortfalls should be re-tasked within their group. If a group
     cannot meet their augmentee quota due to personnel shortages, the total shortfall will be
     identified to 9 RW/CV who will, in coordination with the WAP Manager re-task those
     positions as required.
     3.3.7. Augmentees for Security Forces, CCA, CAT, Cargo Deployment Quick Fix Team,
     RST, EOC, DCC and other augmentations that require advanced training will be recalled
     from the unit’s list of trained personnel.
     3.3.8. Groups assigned quotas for “just in time” functions will select individuals at the
     time of activation and provide them with reporting information.
  3.4. Tenant Unit Participation.
     3.4.1. 940 WG Participation.
        3.4.1.1. The 940 WG will normally support augmentation for the 9 RW during
        “combined wings” Phase I and Phase II exercises and inspections. Available
        augmentation support will be determined on an annual basis and presented to the
        9 RW during the ARB.
        3.4.1.2. 940 WG augmentation is subject to real world constraints; therefore, it will
        be a set quota when able and not determined by the fair share formula.
        3.4.1.3. Close coordination and scheduling with the 940 WG is required to ensure
        availability of personnel and funding to meet the augmentation needs.
     3.4.2. 548 Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance Group (548 ISRG) Participation.
        3.4.2.1. The 548 ISRG will support augmentation for the 9 RW when able.
        Available augmentation support will be determined on an annual basis and presented
        to the 9 RW during the ARB.
        3.4.2.2. 548 ISRG augmentation is subject to real world constraints; therefore, it will
        be a set quota when able and not determined by the fair share formula.
     3.4.3. All Beale AFB tenant units are encouraged to participate in and receive benefits of
     the installation augmentation program.

(7) individuals will be on each shift to cover two 12-hour shifts per day. Four (4) in the grade of E-5
through E-6 are required as NCO Admin Coordinators and 10 in the grade of E-1 through E-6 are
required as Administrators. Team members should have good communication and computer skills.
Due to the high visibility, high demand, and dynamic environment all Augmentee candidates will be
interviewed by the ICC Manager or CAT Director prior to being accepted. Appointees should not
have conflicting emergency/contingency duties, nor be expected to PCS within 12 months. A
SECRET security clearance is required.

TRAINING: Advanced training will be provided by the primary ICC Manager, CAT Director or
Deputy. In-processing and obtaining the required credentials will precede training and typically
takes 15-30 days. Upon selection the Augmentee will be given an in-processing form from the ICC
Manager. Post in-processing initial training will consist of one full day or two half-days. Recurring
proficiency training will take place once a month for approximately two hours.

JUSTIFICATION: Positions ensure smooth execution of command and control of the installation
during any crisis, contingency, or disaster.

(CDF).

DESCRIPTION: Provide a team of trained personnel to ensure the proper physical preparation
of aircraft cargo and the ability to assist units in corrective actions.

REQUIREMENTS: A maximum of twenty individuals are required to support 24-hour shift CDF
operations. Two E-6’s, four E-5’s, and 14 E-1 through E-4’s build up the team.

TRAINING: Advanced intensive Cargo Pallet Build-up and Preparation Training are required
for all augmentees as well as some Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to be provided by 9
LRS (except steel-toed boots which are to be provided for by the tasked unit). The training is
approximately three hours long and is valid for 12 months.

JUSTIFICATION: Existing 9th Support Division personnel are required to man all aspects of
the cargo deployment process. However, additional personnel are required to ensure proper cargo
preparation prior to equipment entering 9th Support Division’s CDF. These personnel will help
ensure there is sufficient time to fix problems as they arise, preventing cargo frustrations from
simple errors.

OPR: 9 CES/CC

AUGMENTATION DUTY: RST

DESCRIPTION: The RST augments the Emergency Management (EM) Flight during peacetime
conditions. Team members perform selected, critical emergency management operational tasks
where EM manning is insufficient. The team members work under EM flight supervision and
assist in the performance of CBRN monitoring, Toxic Industrial Chemical (TIC) monitoring,
major accident response and Emergency Management Control Center duties.

REQUIREMENTS: Eight persons are needed to ensure 24-hour coverage. Four persons are
needed for one, 12-hour shift. Appointees should be in the grade E-4 to E-6. Appointees should
not have conflicting emergency/contingency duties, nor be expected to PCS within 12 months.

TRAINING: Advanced training for RST will be provided by 9 CES/CEX. Training will be
extensive and may entail off-site training funded by HQ ACC/A7XX. At a minimum, RST
members will receive 16 hours of initial training and four hours quarterly. Additionally,
members gain proficiency through exercise participation.

JUSTIFICATION: Due to the limited manning of the 9 CES/CEX flight, as well as the many
tasks required of Emergency Management personnel during disaster and emergency operations,
it is nearly impossible for the Emergency Management Flight to accomplish all of these tasks
internally. References for establishing and training the teams are found in AFI 10-2501, para.
6.6.6., AFMAN 10-2507 Ch 4.

NOTE:
The requirement is for eight (8) E-4 through E-6, all others will be exempt for determining
quotas. 9 MSG will take responsibility for filling all Readiness Support Team augmentee
positions due to full exemption from filling CCA management and operations augmentation.

                         SHELTER MANAGEMENT TEMPLATE

Figure A9.1. Shelter Management Template.
OPR: 9 CES/CC

AUGMENTATION DUTY: Shelter Manager

DESCRIPTION: A shelter program assures a protective program is available to protect the base
population from the effects of war and disaster. Shelter managers are vital to meeting the
peacetime emergency and wartime responsibilities of the Wing's full spectrum threat response
program. They provide management of shelter occupants during shelter activation and are
responsible for radiological exposure control procedures within their shelter. During disasters
that require relocation of base or local community personnel into shelters, shelter managers
provide overall management and coordinate shelter requirements with the Wing Installation
Control Center (ICC) and outside relief agencies.

REQUIREMENTS: 16 FGO’s and 16 SNCO’s are needed to operate eight shelters on a 24-hour
basis. Both wartime and natural disaster shelters would not be activated simultaneously;
however, worst-case scenario would require eight natural disaster shelters to support evacuation
and sheltering of base personnel as well as reception of flood refugees due to local flooding.

TRAINING: Just-in-time training is required prior to shelter activation. Training will be
provided by 9 CES/CEXM. Training is approximately two hours long and is valid for 20
months.
