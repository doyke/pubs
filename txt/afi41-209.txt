Medical Logistics provides equipment, materiel, services, and information to the Air Force (AF)
medical mission.

This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 41-2, Medical Support. It
provides guidance for establishing and operating medical logistics support for Air Force Military
Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and other activities. This instruction applies to all Air Force, Air
Force Reserve and Air National Guard (ANG) activities with an assigned Medical Supply (FM)
account as defined by AFI 23-111, Management of Government Property in Possession of the
Air Force, Attachment 2. It does not apply to non-FM account supported medical units except
where stated otherwise. This AFI may be supplemented at any level, but all supplements that
directly implement this publication must be routed to AFMOA/SGAL for coordination prior to
certification and approval. Refer questions and suggested improvements to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; send AF
Form 847 to AFMOA/SGALO, DMLC Building, 693 Neiman Street, Fort Detrick, MD 21702-
5006 (email: afmoa.sgalo@us.af.mil). Tier waiver authorities are defined in AFI 33-360,
Publications and Forms Management. The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in
this publication are identified with a Tier number (T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3) following the compliance
statement. See AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, Table 1.1 for a description of
the authorities associated with the Tier numbers. Submit requests for waivers through the chain
of command to the appropriate Tier waiver approval authority, or alternately, to the Publication
OPR for the non-tiered compliance items. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual
 2                                                                                              AFI41-209 6 OCTOBER 2014

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised. As part of the transition to the new AF Inspection
System (AFIS), this AFI was streamlined to prioritize mission and inspection compliance
requirements. The rewritten AFI reduces the compliance burden on field units and provides
Wing Commanders flexibility in tailoring their inspections to local conditions. The AFI also
identifies Tiered waiver authorities in accordance with AFI 33-360. Most “how to” information
was removed in order to allow Wings maximum flexibility to accomplish mission requirements
guidance included in this AFI. Separate chapters for Vehicle Control and Linen Supply were
removed and key responsibilities for these functions were included in Chapter 1, General and
Administrative.

6.27. Accountability and Financial Reporting of Investment Equipment.
   6.27.1. Assets defined as investment (capital) equipment are required to be accounted for
   and reported for capitalization and depreciation IAW with SFFAS No. 6. Depreciation data
   is automatically calculated by DMLSS and forwarded to the General Accounting and Finance
   System-Rehost during end-of-month processing. (T-0).
   6.27.2. Determination of acquisition cost. Original acquisition cost includes all costs
   incurred to bring the equipment into service for its intended use. These costs include
   amounts paid to vendors, transportation to point of initial use, handling and storage costs,
   interest costs paid, direct/indirect production costs, installation costs, and all surcharges paid.
   Credits received from vendors for existing assets do not affect acquisition cost (i.e., if
   equipment costs $10,000 and a $1,000 credit is received for turn-in of existing equipment,
   the acquisition cost for the new item will be established as $10,000). (T-0).
      6.27.2.1. For medical expense equipment, the acquisition cost will include the total unit
      price plus AFWCF/MDD surcharge. This cost is accurately populated in DMLSS in the
      EM record when the receipt is processed. (T-0).
      6.27.2.2. For OP equipment and high cost medical expense equipment centrally procured
      by AFMOA, the acquisition cost will include the total contract price plus contracting
      agency surcharge and/or AFWCF/MDD surcharge. AFMOA/SGAL will notify MTF
      MEMOs of total acquisition costs prior to receipt. (T-0).
      6.27.2.3. For medical systems, ensure the major component (end item) includes the total
      calculated acquisition cost. Acquisition costs for component items should be established
      in DMLSS as $0.01. (T-0).
      6.27.2.4. The original acquisition cost will not be adjusted without the prior approval of
      AFMOA/SGAL. (T-1).
   6.27.3. The equipment acquisition date (in service date) is the date the title for the equipment
   passes to the AF. In most instances, the acquisition date for non-installed equipment is the
   date the equipment was physically received and signed for by Medical Logistics (i.e., proof
   of delivery date). For installed equipment, it is the date of acceptance. (T-0).
   6.27.4. Leased or rented equipment.
      6.27.4.1. Acquisition price.
          6.27.4.1.1. Capital leases. A capital lease should be recorded at the lower of either:
          (1) the net present value of minimum lease payments, excluding that portion of the
          payments representing administrative costs paid to the lessor; or, (2) the fair market
          value of the leased property when the lease began. Capital leases should be
          depreciated over the life of the lease or the depreciation term, whichever is shorter.
          (T-0).
          6.27.4.1.2. Operating leases. The equipment acquisition price for operating leases is
          zero. Title for this equipment remains with the lessor and will not be depreciated.
