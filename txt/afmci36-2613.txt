                                            Chapter 1

              ACQUISITION PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

1.1. Background. The Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) was signed
in 1990. Its purpose is to improve the effectiveness of the acquisition workforce and thereby
improve the acquisition process. The DAWIA requires the Department of Defense (DoD) to
establish a process through which the acquisition workforce would be recognized as having
achieved professional status through certification. Certification confirms an individual meets the
minimum mandatory education, training, and work experience requirements established for an
acquisition position. In addition to meeting certification requirements, personnel must establish
tailored plans for continuous learning to increase functional proficiency, maintain currency,
increase cross-functional competencies and keep pace with initiatives in the Acquisition
Technology and Logistics (AT&L) environment. The continuous learning plan can be
incorporated into the Individual Development Plan (IDP). DAWIA requires the designation of
acquisition positions, establishes standards to be met by individuals in acquisition positions in
the DoD specified career categories, and creates an Acquisition Corps.
1.2. Implementation of DAWIA. APDP is the Air Force instrument to implement DAWIA.
Air Force APDP policy can be found in AFI 63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle Management.
HQ AFMC/A1 is designated by AFMC/CC as the focal point for AFMC management and
oversight of the program. Management of APDP includes, but is not limited to, the following:
     1.2.1. Designate APDP managers. APDP managers are designated at the MAJCOM, centers
     and sites and will have the responsibilities as outlined in Chapter 2.
     1.2.2. Acquisition position management. The objective of position management is to ensure
     acquisition positions are identified and managed IAW Air Force policy. Accurate APDP
     position identification and requirements are fundamental to creating a workforce with the
     right education, training, and experience to successfully execute the mission. This requires a
     thorough understanding of Air Force APDP.
     1.2.3. APDP certification. The certification process is automated for personnel requesting
     certification through the Air Force ACQ Now Certification tool. The Under Secretary of
     Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD/AT&L) prescribes the levels of
     certification and the minimum training, education, and experience requirements for
     certification in each career category. The Defense Acquisition University (DAU) Catalog
     (http://icatalog.dau.mil/) lists the Core Certification Standards (required for DAWIA
     certification) for each of the APDP career categories in the Certification and Core
     Development Guides. AFMC personnel who meet certification standards must request
     certification    through     the    Air   Force     ACQ      Now      Certification  tool.
     (https://www.atrrs.army.mil/channels/acqnowcert/student/logon.aspx?Caller=1)
     1.2.4. Certification Training Withdrawals and No-shows. AFMC will follow DAU and
     Secretary of the Air Force/Acquisition Training Office (SAF/ATO) policies and processes
     for certification training withdrawals and no-shows. The policies can be found at:
     http://www.dau.mil/studentInfo/Pages/student_info.aspx                              and
     https://www.atrrs.army.mil/channels/acqnow/.
AFMCI 36-2613 5 NOVEMBER 2014                                                             5


  1.2.5. Acquisition records management. Acquisition records management is essential to
  ensuring acquisition personnel records are accurate and updated in a timely manner for
  experience coding, course completions, certifications, System Program Office (SPO)
  experience, and Acquisition Corps membership. The automated tools for certification and
  DAU course registration use the official records in the Army Training Requirements and
  Resources System (ATRRS) and Acquisition Career Management System (ACMS) to
  determine eligibility for DAU course registration and qualifications for certification.
  Automated management tools depend on accurate records in the Defense Civilian Personnel
  Data System (DCPDS) and Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS). Adjudications
  approved by MAJCOM APDP Functional Managers and updated in ACMS do not flow into
  DCPDS or MilPDS.
  1.2.6. Reporting. Certification rates, Acquisition Corps qualifications, and personnel
  delinquent in certification are monitored and reported to AFMC leadership as specified in
  Chapter 8. Corrective actions, including training plans and waivers, must be initiated for
  delinquent personnel as outlined in Chapter 6.

                        ACQUISITION POSITION MANAGEMENT

3.1. Acquisition Position Designation. Supervisors, through the CSF (or designated Senior
Functional), recommend designating positions as acquisition IAW Air Force and DoD policy.
Reference the Air Force step-by-step process for designating and coding acquisition positions
and      the    AT&L      PCDs     that    define     the    functional      career     categories
(http://icatalog.dau.mil/pcds.asp). A position is considered acquisition if the duties are greater
than 50% acquisition related.
3.2. Acquisition Position Coding. Acquisition positions are coded by position career category,
level, criticality, and special assignment (if KLP). The coding is based on the occupational
series/Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) of the position identified in the Air Force position
coding matrix, the AT&L PCDs, and the guidelines outlined in the acquisition position
level/criticality matrix located on the Air Force APDP Portal. A position may only be coded
with one acquisition career category code. This coding is reflected in MPES for both military
and civilian positions. If the employee is not assigned to the position correctly in MILPDS or
DCPDS, it will impact the employee’s ability to complete certification or meet Acquisition
Corps requirements.
   3.2.1. Civilian position descriptions should be annotated with any coding change, date
   changed, and the appropriate Other Significant Facts statement depending on the criticality of
   the coded position to which assigned (Attachment 2).
   3.2.2. Civilian acquisition over hire positions will not have a manpower position to emulate.
   Overhire positions will be created in DCPDS by following the manpower guidance for
   Position Indicator, Career Category, Career Level, and Special Assignment. Supervisors,
   through the CSF (or designated Senior Functional), recommend civilian acquisition over hire
   position additions/changes.
   3.2.3. There are four acquisition fields in MPES. An Authorization Change Request (ACR)
   may be used to code military and civilian positions in the MPES through the servicing
   manpower office. The fields and codes are identified in the MPES Acquisition Coding Table
   and include the following:

Table 3.1. Acquisition Fields in MPES
  Code      Description
  FAQ 1     APT (required field) for criticality (Codes 2, 3, 4, or 6) (Codes 3&6 require
            SAF approval)
  FAQ 2     APC (required field) (Codes A, C, D, E, H, I, K, L, P, R, S, T, & W)
  FAQ 3     ACL (required field) (Codes 1, 2, 3, and 9 (Interns only))
  FAQ 4     SAA (only for KLPs) (Codes A, B, C, D, E, F, L, N, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X)
   3.2.4. The codes are the same in DCPDS as in MPES, but the field descriptions vary slightly.
   The APDP Coding Sheet identifies the fields that can be coded. It is used to request changes
   in current position coding in DCPDS by AFPC. The fields in DCPDS are:
 12                                                     AFMCI 36-2613 5 NOVEMBER 2014


Table 3.2. Acquisition Field Descriptions in DCPDS
 Acq Position Indicator (required field) for criticality (Codes are same as above)
 Acq Position Career Category (required field) (Codes are same as above)
 Acq Career Level (required field)(Codes are same as above)
 Acq Special Assignment (only for KLPs) (Codes are same as above)
3.3. Acquisition Position Coding. To be APDP certified, an employee must have APDP
"coded" acquisition experience recorded in MilPDS/DCPDS, or experience adjudicated by the
MAJCOM APDP Functional Manager (Chapter 7) and annotated in ACMS. The Center APDP
Functional Manager is responsible for the career category of the position being coded and
provides guidance.
   3.3.1. Military Coding. Acquisition coded experience for a military member is gained when
   they are assigned to acquisition-coded positions. Changes to position coding will be
   determined by unit management and processed via an ACR by the manpower office.
   Military members may have existing coded or non-coded experience adjudicated by the
   appropriate MAJCOM APDP Functional Manager. Caution should be exercised when
   changing existing coding since it may result in the loss of a previous certification. Current
   position coding in MPES can only be changed by the servicing manpower office.
   3.3.2. Civilian Coding. Current APDP position coding does not flow from MPES to update
   DCPDS for civilians. Civilian requests for a coding update/change to the current position
   must be submitted to AFPC on an APDP coding sheet. An APDP coding sheet must be
   submitted with any Request for Personnel Action (RPA) or non RPA action to identify the
   APDP coding of the position.
3.4. Duty History Coding. Experience coding cannot be changed without the approval of the
MAJCOM APDP Functional Manager as outlined in the experience adjudication process in
Chapter 7. Once experience is coded and used toward certification, it cannot be re-coded in
another functional category or used toward certification in another functional category. If the
previous coding was used to meet a general acquisition experience requirement, it can also be
used toward the specialized acquisition experience required for certification. Recoding
Exception: With the implementation of two certifications (BUS-FM & BUS-CE) that separated
from one joint certification (BCEFM) in Oct 09, individuals with the BCEFM certification were
allowed to recode their pre-Oct 09 experiences after review by the SAF/FMC Review Panel (per
page 3 of the implementation memo). Their prior FM experiences were reviewed to determine
which of the new categories the experiences best fit. Thus, individuals may keep their old FM
certification even if experience adjudications were made to reflect no acquisition time in that
older certification. All experience requirements after Oct 09 must be properly reflected in the
individual’s record to receive certification.
   3.4.1. Updates to duty experience that do not require proof of adjudication are as follows:
       3.4.1.1. If the military member's current position is coded in MPES (assignment area of
       the ACMS brief) the duty experience can be coded, unless the member is an Individual
       Mobilization Augmentee (IMA).
       3.4.1.2. When a determination is made to remove coding from a current position, the
       employee will retain all APDP coded experience up until the coding is actually removed.
       Military positions must first have a duplicative duty history entered into MilPDS by the
AFMCI 36-2613 5 NOVEMBER 2014                                                             13


     MPS, effective from the time the coding is to be removed. Once this is completed in
     MilPDS, the coding can be removed by manpower in MPES. Civilian position coding
     must be removed by manpower in MPES and a Request for Personnel Action (RPA) must
     be submitted to Civilian Personnel to create a new duty history entry beginning from the
     time the coding is to be removed.
     3.4.1.3. SAF/AQH maintains the list of civilian occupational series and military duty
     AFSCs that are, by definition, acquisition and must be APDP coded.
 14                                                                                           AFMCI 36-2613 5 NOVEMBER 2014


                                                                        Chapter 4

                                                       APDP CERTIFICATION

4.1. Certification Qualifications. The DAU iCatalog (http://icatalog.dau.mil/) contains a
guide containing the core certification standards for each APDP functional category. Employees
do not need to be currently assigned to an APDP coded position to be certified, but must be able
to meet all certification standards. Note: Employees not currently assigned to an APDP coded
position will be a lower training priority than those requiring training for their current position.
4.2. Certification Grace Period. Under DAWIA, employees have a grace period (generally 24
months) following assignment to a coded position to be certified for the category and level of the
position they’re assigned. If an employee is not certified within the grace period, an approved
position requirements waiver is required to remain on the coded position. Supervisors will
initiate a position requirements waiver for employees who are within 6 months of their GPE date
and do not have confirmed reservations in the required certification courses. The waiver requires
the establishment of a training plan for the employee to meet the requirements. Supervisors will
also initiate a position requirements waiver if employees are within 6 months of their GPE date
and will not complete the certification requirements before a new DAU catalog is issued. Center
APDP Functional Managers will ensure personnel have approved position requirements waivers,
when required (Chapter 6). If the civilian GPE date is incorrect in DCPDS, the MAJCOM
APDP Functional Manager can request AFPC update the Date Level Certification Due field in
DCPDS to reflect the correct date. Military GPE dates are calculated based on assignment date
and cannot be changed manually.
4.3. Certification Documentation. Employees must request certification in the Acq Now
Certification                                                                               tool
https://www.atrrs.army.mil/channels/acqnowcert/student/logon.aspx?Caller=1. If the ACQ
Now system cannot be used to process a certification request, the certification must be manually
approved/disapproved by SAF/AQ. Figure 4.1. illustrates the process for manual certifications.

                         CRITICAL ACQUISITION POSITIONS

5.1. Critical Acquisition Positions and Key Leadership Position Requirements. Personnel
assigned to CAPs, including KLPs, are required to meet the acquisition corps membership
requirements IAW Air Force policy prior to assignment; otherwise, a position requirements
waiver for assignment to the position must be approved. This waiver must be input into the
AT&L Waivers system by the gaining unit at the time of assignment. KLPs and deputy program
managers of ACAT II programs must also meet the statutory requirements prior to assignment or
require an approved position requirements waiver prior to assignment.
   5.1.1. Personnel assigned to CAPs must sign a 3-year tenure agreement prior to assignment.
   Personnel assigned to Key Leadership Positions must sign a tenure agreement for 4 years or
   to the closest program milestone prior to assignment. If not otherwise stipulated by the
   Program Executive Officer (PEO), the KLP tenure period will default to 4 years. Supervisors
   will provide a copy of the tenure agreement to the employee and file it in the Supervisor’s
   Employee Work Folder (971 Folder).
   5.1.2. If the incumbent of a CAP or KLP is moved from the position prior to the tenure
   agreement end date, an approved CAP tenure waiver is required prior to reassignment
   (Chapter 6). The acceptable deviations from a CAP tenure agreement can be found on the on
   the Air Force APDP Portal. The exceptions do not apply to KLPs. The tenure waiver must
   be entered into DCPDS/MilPDS before the assignment can be made effective. The Special
   Assignment field should only be populated if the position is a KLP.
   5.1.3. Reassignment Nature of Actions (NOAs) resulting from an organizational realignment
   or pay system conversion that do not change the position duties and program effort or
   function do not require a new tenure agreement. The employee will remain on the existing
   agreement, if applicable.
   5.1.4. Reassignments. The PEO or their designated representative is given authority to
   determine the need for a new tenure agreement when an individual is reassigned from a non-
   KLP CAP within the PEO portfolio to another non-KLP CAP within the same PEO portfolio.
   In such cases, a new tenure agreement is not required. The employee will remain on the
   original tenure agreement. The employee supervisor will file the PEO approval in the
   Supervisor’s Employee Work Folder (971 Folder) and submit a copy to the MPS with the
   assignment action.
   5.1.5. Temporary Promotions and Details. No tenure agreement is required for a temporary
   promotion or detail. However, a waiver at the time of assignment is needed if the CAP
   requirements have not been met. If the assignment becomes a permanent promotion, the time
   on the temporary assignment is credited toward the tenure period. Personnel temporarily
   promoted or detailed from a position requiring tenure do not need a tenure waiver.
   5.1.6. Acquisition Corps. The Defense Acquisition Corps is a cadre of acquisition
   professionals who have met minimum DoD and statutory DAWIA requirements for filling
   CAPs. Qualification requires meeting specific education, training, experience, certification
   and grade requirements. The Air Force brings military personnel into the corps automatically

  when they meet all of the requirements. When the automatic update does not occur, HQ
  AFMC/A1 will work with MPS to update MilPDS. Civilians no longer need to submit
  documentation for membership in the corps. Personnel records are reviewed by SAF/AQ
  quarterly and then updated to reflect corps membership in the systems of record. Members
  who believe they meet corps eligibility/membership requirements, but it is not reflected in
  their ACMS records should contact their Center APDP Functional Manager.

                     ACQUISITION POSITION/TENURE WAIVERS

6.1. Waiver Process. All waivers are initiated by the supervisor and processed through the
Center APDP Functional Manager. Waivers must be initiated on DD Form 2905, "AT&L
Workforce Position Requirements or Tenure Waiver," which is generated using the AT&L
Workforce                                   Waiver                                 System
(https://www.atrrs.army.mil/channels/atlwaivers/admin/logon.aspx).
   6.1.1. Position Requirements Waivers. The gaining supervisor must initiate a position
   requirements waiver whenever an individual to be assigned to a CAP does not meet
   acquisition corps requirements or statutory requirements. The waiver must be approved by
   the Center Executive Director prior to assignment and submitted to the personnel office with
   the assignment action for input into DCPDS/MilPDS. PEOs and Program Managers (PMs)
   who are assigned to KLPs have six months from the date assigned to complete the Executive
   Program Managers Course (PMT 402), otherwise a position requirements waiver is required
   to remain on the position. The Service Acquisition Executive (SAE) is the approval
   authority for KLP position requirements and tenure waivers.
   6.1.2. Delinquent Certification. Personnel are considered delinquent when they are not
   certified within the grace period allowed by Air Force to meet the position certification
   requirements. Personnel who exceed this GPE date must be moved to a non-coded position
   unless an AT&L position requirements waiver has been approved outlining the individual’s
   training plan and timeframe to achieve the required certification. Center APDP Functional
   Managers will ensure personnel have an approved position requirements waiver prior to
   exceeding the GPE date. Personnel assigned to level 3 positions require a position
   requirements waiver prior to assignment if they cannot be certified within the allotted grace
   period.
      6.1.2.1. Delinquent Continuous Learning (CL) Points. Personnel are considered
      delinquent when they have not met the CL standard. If they remain delinquent for more
      than two months they will not be eligible for acquisition commander/director positions;
      and will not be eligible for special acquisition career development programs or AF
      acquisition awards without an approved waiver.
   6.1.3. Tenure Agreement Waivers. CAP and KLP tenure agreements may be waived. The
   tenure waiver releases the assigned individual from the tenure agreement. The losing
   supervisor initiates the tenure agreement waiver, DD Form 2905, if personnel are reassigned
   prior to expiration of the tenure agreement.
   6.1.4. Non-CAP Position Requirements Waiver Approval Authority. The center commander
   may delegate, to the CSF (or designated Senior Functional), the authority to
   approve/disapprove non-CAP position requirements waivers for personnel who do not meet
   the certification requirements of their position at the end of the grace period following
   assignment to the position. Non-CAP waivers must be approved by an O6/GS-15 or higher.
   6.1.5. Critical Position Requirements Waiver Approval Authority. The Center Executive
   Director approves/disapproves all CAP requirements waivers. The CSF (or designated
   Senior Functional) will coordinate on all CAP requirements waivers. All CAP requirements

  waivers, except waivers for new hires, will include coordination by the responsible
  MAJCOM APDP Functional Manager prior to sending to Center Executive Director for
  approval.
  6.1.6. Senior Contracting Official Position Requirements Waiver. Approval authority for
  position requirements waivers for senior contracting official positions will be delegated IAW
  Air Force policy.
  6.1.7. Waiver Tracking. Center APDP Functional Managers will monitor the status of
  personnel assigned to CAPs to ensure waivers and tenure agreements have been submitted
  when required.
  6.1.8. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring employees meet position requirements IAW
  the timelines documented in approved waivers. Supervisors will ensure justification and a
  training plan is included on all position waivers.

                                ADJUDICATION PROCESS

7.1. Experience Adjudication. An employee’s prior employment may include acquisition
experience which may be added to their official personnel records through the adjudication
process. The employee must submit a request to the Center APDP Functional Manager (or
review authority), along with any supporting documentation (e.g. OPRs/EPRs, position
descriptions (PDs), functional checklists, appraisals, resumes, and/or letters from former
supervisors), to have prior experience adjudicated as acquisition. The Center APDP Functional
Manager (or review authority) will review the adjudication package for appropriate supporting
documentation. The employee record should also be reviewed to ensure the experience to be
adjudicated was not previously used toward certification which required specialized experience.
If the series/AFSC does not meet the allowable coding guidance, there is no series assigned to
the prior experience, or the employee was performing acquisition duties outside their official
duties, the employee may still request adjudication of the experience if valid documentation of
the experience is provided.
   7.1.1. If the request meets the above criteria, the Center APDP Functional Manager (or
   review authority) will forward the request for approval to the MAJCOM APDP Functional
   Manager for the career category for which the coding is being requested. The MAJCOM
   APDP Functional Manager will review the supporting documentation and determine if the
   duties performed were greater than 50% acquisition duties as required by the functional
   checklist or PCD. If the experience to be adjudicated is currently coded in another functional
   career category, the MAJCOM APDP Functional Manager must coordinate the
   recommendation to change the position coding with the other affected MAJCOM APDP
   Functional Manager. This coordination must occur before the adjudication is approved and
   the record updated. For contracting, the above process will be accomplished prior to
   forwarding the experience adjudication request to SAF/AQC for approval.
   7.1.2. If the MAJCOM APDP Functional Manager approves the adjudication request (or in
   the case of contracting, concurs with the request subject to SAF/AQC final approval), he/she
   will notify the Center APDP Functional Manager via e-mail. The Center APDP Functional
   Manager is responsible for notifying the employee of status and final resolution of the
   adjudication request.
   7.1.3. HQ AFMC personnel will work directly with the MAJCOM APDP Functional
   Manager for the career category for which the coding is being requested.
7.2. Records Correction. The process for correcting an employee’s acquisition record is the
same as experience adjudication.
7.3. System Program Office (SPO) Experience Adjudication. Credit for SPO experience is
determined by the MAJCOM APDP Functional Manager for Program Management, based on an
employee request for a records review. This request should be submitted to Center APDP
Functional Manager (or review authority) for processing. The Center APDP Functional Manager
(or review authority) will forward the request to the MAJCOM APDP Functional Manager for
Program Management. If approved, the record is updated via the ACMS adjudication tool for
 20                                                    AFMCI 36-2613 5 NOVEMBER 2014


civilians and MilPDS for military personnel. Civilian position location codes "L" or "M" are no
longer used to automatically determine SPO experience.
7.4. DAU Course Fulfillment Adjudication. MAJCOM APDP Functional Managers
adjudicate requests for DAU course fulfillment IAW Air Force policy and input via ACMS once
approved. Blanket Air Force course fulfillments are input into DCPDS and MilPDS by
SAF/AQH and do not require adjudication.

                                        REPORTING

8.1. Background. AFMC manages APDP by monitoring compliance with DAWIA using
reporting tools. Periodic status of certification and acquisition corps qualifications must be
reported to AFMC management as stated below. The results of these reporting processes are
incorporated in the AT&L annual reporting requirements to Congress.
8.2. Certification and Acquisition Corps Qualified Metrics. Certification and acquisition
corps qualified metrics for the command are generated from the Acquisition Metrics Snapshot
report. The backup data in the report identifies personnel who are not properly certified or not
acquisition corps qualified, as outlined below. Center DPs must report these metrics to center
commanders quarterly.
8.3. Reporting Responsibilities.
   8.3.1. HQ AFMC/A1. Provide quarterly command-wide delinquency status updates to
   AFMC/CC. The data used to create the metric is generated from the quarterly acquisition
   metrics report mentioned in paragraph 8.2. The quarterly acquisition metrics report will be
   distributed to MAJCOM APDP Functional Managers and Center APDP Managers by the
   10th day of the new quarter.
   8.3.2. MAJCOM APDP Functional Managers.                  Distribute the quarterly delinquent
   certification status to the Center Senior Functional (or designated Senior Functional).
   8.3.3. Center DP. Provide Center-wide delinquent certification status to the center
   commander on a quarterly basis.
   8.3.4. Center APDP Functional Managers. Work with first-level supervisors to determine
   reasons for certification delinquency. Report quarterly to the MAJCOM APDP Functional
   Manager.
   8.3.5. First Level Supervisors. Working through the chain of command, report reasons for
   overdue certification to the Center APDP Functional Manager.

        1. You are receiving this email because you are assigned to an APDP coded position
        and you are not currently certified for the acquisition career category and level required
        by your position. DoD certification requirements are located in Appendix B at
        http://icatalog.dau.mil/ . Personnel assigned to APDP coded positions have a 24 month
        grace period from the date assigned to the coded position to get certified or to secure an
        approved Position Requirements Waiver which outlines a plan for meeting the
        certification requirements. Your 24 month grace period expiration (GPE) is listed in
        the information above. The acquisition certifications that are reflected in the personnel
        system for you are displayed above.

        2. Acquisition personnel are responsible for ensuring their official records are accurate
        and reflect the most current APDP information as this may affect acquisition workforce
        statistics, your training opportunities, and career progression. The information above
        shows how your position is coded in both the manpower and personnel systems. It is
        imperative that you are coded correctly. Your acquisition coding should be identical in
        both systems. The exception is if you are on a civilian overhire position, you will only
        be coded in the personnel system. If the coding between personnel and manpower is
        not identical, please inform your supervisor.

        3. The Acquisition Career Management System (ACMS) is the Air Force official site to
        review your acquisition record. You can access your ACMS brief at
        https://w20.afpc.randolph.af.mil/afpcsecurenet20/CheckPortal.aspx . The position
        coding guidance is located at

     If you have questions regarding your certification, position coding, or GPE date, please
     contact your supervisor. Your supervisor may contact the center APDP POC with any
     additional questions.

               Please provide a copy of this notice to your supervisor.
