This instruction implements AFPD 40-1, Health Promotion, and establishes guidelines for the Public
Access Defibrillation (PAD) Program for Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance
Agency and its associated units located in San Antonio, TX, hereafter collectively referred to as “AF ISR
Agency.” This response plan describes how the AF ISR Agency PAD Program will be conducted and how
AF ISR Agency personnel will respond to an acute cardiac event. This guidance also describes the place-
ment and maintenance of automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) used in the unit PAD program. AEDs
will be placed in various locations within AF ISR Agency based on medical and facility guidelines. Prior
to arrival of medical personnel, these devices can be employed by trained personnel to revive individuals
who have suffered an acute cardiac event. This instruction identifies responsibilities, maintenance, quality
assurance, and documentation requirements. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publi-
cation to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for
Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of

2. Background: The federal government has mandated that AEDs be placed in “all” federal government
buildings. Specific guidelines (locations and timelines) for implementation of this directive were dele-
gated to the users. The Commander, 37th Training Wing, has overall responsibility for the Lackland PAD
Program and has delegated to the Commander, 59th Medical Wing, the responsibility of ensuring the
Lackland PAD Program meets proper medical objectives and to provide the professional guidance for
program medical administration. The 59 MDW/CC, in turn, appointed, in writing a Medical Director and
a Training Program Coordinator for the Lackland PAD Program. AF ISR Agency has been designated as
a unit that will have AEDs. The 59 MDW/Medical Director will assist Lackland AFB units, including AF
ISR Agency, to ensure the Lackland PAD program complies with the federal mandate and that AF ISR
Agency personnel receive training in the use of the AED during basic life support (BLS) training courses.

3. Responsibilities:
    3.1. After being appointed in writing by the unit commander, the PAD Site Coordinator serves as a
    liaison between Lackland AFB units having AEDs and the Lackland PAD Program Medical Director.
    The PAD Site Coordinator for AF ISR Agency will be the agency surgeon (AF ISR Agency/SG). In
    addition to serving as a liaison, the AF ISR Agency PAD Site Coordinator will:
       3.1.1. Be trained and maintain certification, at a minimum, in BLS/AED operation.
       3.1.2. Ensure that AF ISR Agency lay rescuers/responders (LRR) are trained and maintain current
       certification in BLS/AED. Ensure that the AEDs are properly maintained.
       3.1.3. Ensure that all required inspections and maintenance actions for AEDs at AF ISR Agency
       are accomplished in accordance with the manufacturer’s manual.

   guidelines and facility management guidance.
   4.2. Monitoring and Maintenance AED status:
      4.2.1. Before installation of a specific AED unit, the facility manager in coordination with the unit
      commander will designate the individual(s) who will have the responsibility to inspect the AED
      on a daily basis to ensure the unit is operational. A log (see Attachment 2) documenting the
      required inspections will be placed with each AED. When the battery life or service indicator is lit,
      the individual performing the inspection will replace the battery, if indicated. If there are any prob-
      lems with replacing the battery, or if the service indicator remains lit, the individual will notify the
4                                                                  AFISRAI40-101 4 AUGUST 2008

       tenance will assist AF ISR Agency in any maintenance beyond the AF ISR Agency Site Coordina-
       tor’s ability to accomplish.

5. Response and Post-Response Actions:
    5.1. Any unusual event, including a suspected acute cardiac event, will result in an “event alarm”
    within AF ISR Agency facilities: due to the unique nature of security requirements in all buildings
    occupied by AF ISR Agency personnel, specific personnel are immediately notified in the case of any
    unusual event, including a “man down” event. These specific personnel are located in various loca-
    tions, depending on the specific building, but include: the operations centers, the watch floors, the
    entry control points, and/or the facility managers. Upon notification of a “man down,” AF ISR
    Agency LRRs will be expected to immediately respond to the location, taking with them the nearest
    AED.
    5.2. In the event of a suspected acute cardiac event, the LRRs will immediately telephone “911” if
    that has not already been done. In addition, the 37 SFS/Desk Sergeant (210-671-2018) will also be
    notified to facilitate ambulance access to AF ISR Agency and medical personnel to the victim once
    inside the facility.
       5.2.1. LRRs will then begin initial BLS and operation of the AED within the scope of their train-
       ing.
       5.2.2. The LRRS will continue with BLS until emergency personnel arrive on site. 37 SFS per-
       sonnel will assist emergency responders in gaining access to the site.
    5.3. Post-Response Actions:
       5.3.1. Following the use of the AED, the LRR operating the AED will wipe the pads clean accord-
       ing to the manufacturer’s recommendations (instructions inside the manual which will be kept
       with the AED).
       5.3.2. The LRR operator will replace the electrodes and reconnect them to the AED.
       5.3.3. The LRR operator will return the AED to its original location.
       5.3.4. The LRR will ensure that the AED is in operating condition and that consumables are
       re-ordered.
AFISRAI40-101 4 AUGUST 2008                                                                             5


      5.3.5. The LRR operating the AED will complete the Events Summary Sheet (Attachment 3) and
      forward it to the AF ISR Agency Site Coordinator (AF ISR Agency/SG) immediately following
      the event.
      5.3.6. The AF ISR Agency Site Coordinator will verify that the AED is back in its original loca-
      tion, that it is in good working order, and that consumables have been replaced.
   5.4. The Lackland PAD Program Medical Director must receive and approve the AF ISR Agency
   PAD Program Response Plan (this operating instruction) prior to AF ISR Agency obtaining an
   AED(s) and implementing the AF ISR Agency PAD Program.

6. Quality Assurance:
   6.1. The AF ISR Agency Site Coordinator will forward all Event Summary Sheets to the Lackland
   PAD Program Medical Director within 24 hours for review.
   6.2. The Lackland PAD Program Medical Director will conduct a review of all event summary sheets
   to assess quality of care, to ensure that procedures were followed in accordance with federal and state
   law, and to provide AF ISR Agency with appropriate feedback. This documentation will be handled in
   accordance with 10 USC § 1102.
