1. Incident Response Structure:
     1.1. Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS) Structure:
        1.1.1. AFIMS will be implemented by the following bodies: Crisis Action Team (CAT),
        Emergency Operations Center (EOC), Incident Commander (IC), Emergency
        Communications Center (ECC), Fire Alarm Communications Center (FACC) and all
        Emergency and First Responders. This collective capability is termed the Disaster
        Response Force (DRF).
        1.1.2. During real world response and normal operations, all incident response and
        support functions will be handled by the host installation organization for Hill AFB (75
        Air Base Wing), and directed support agencies.
        1.1.3. During Operational Readiness Exercise’s (ORE) or Operational Readiness
        Inspections (ORI), the 419 Fighter Wing will run all incident response structure for
        exercise purposes only.
        1.1.4. The EOC will operate as the C2 support element that directs, monitors, and
        supports the installation’s action before, during, and after an incident. The EOC provides
        a flexible and scalable capability, tasked to provide support and coordination. During
        ORE/ORI the EOC will form using Emergency Support Functions (ESFs) as shown in
        Table 1.

           fill this EOC representative tasking. Other units may be tasked to provide EOC
           representatives as situations require. The unit EM Quarterly Report is the mechanism
           for EOC appointments supporting OREs/ORIs.
           1.1.5.3. Units listed in Table 2 are required to maintain a Unit Control Center (UCC)
           capability to support response operations and their EOC representatives. The UCC
           does not need to be operational during normal day-to-day business, but it must be
           able to activate during OREs/ORIs to support to the EOC.
           1.1.5.4. Organizations tasked in Table 2 to provide EOC representatives will have a
           minimum of two personnel (one primary and one alternate) assigned. The 419 FW
           Readiness and Emergency Management Flight will conduct initial and refresher
           training for EOC appointees as required. The EOC appointee will be thoroughly
           knowledgeable with the unit’s assets, capabilities, and functional response tasking. If
           the appointed representative is not the unit commander, he/she must have sufficient
           authority to commit unit resources as directed by the EOC Director or CAT Director
           and must be authorized to fill the EOC tasking in place of the unit commander.
           1.1.5.5. IAW AFI 10-2501, the EOC Director is the MSG Commander or other
           senior representative designated.    The EOC Director provides support and
           coordination for emergency response to incidents. Additionally, the EOC Director
           will provide the CAT Director with regular updates during responses involving the
           EOC. Before leaving the EOC, the EOC Director must appoint and brief a
           replacement. IAW AFI 10-2501, the replacement must meet the same training
           requirements as the EOC Director.
           1.1.5.6. IAW AFI 10-2501 the EOC Manager will be the EM Flight Officer or
           Superintendent and will be trained IAW AFI 10-2501, Chapter 6. During periods of
           minimal manning, or as otherwise directed by the EOC Director, a 3E9 Non-
           Commissioned Officer (NCO) will fill this tasking. The EOC Manager assists and
           serves as an advisor to the EOC Director, providing information and guidance related
