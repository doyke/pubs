SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Throughout the
pamphlet, a new criterion has been implemented due to the rewrite of several publications and
the new supplements of Air Force Global Strike Command.
7.4. Safety briefings will be given to all personnel upon entering a licensed location. Briefings
will include, at a minimum, hazard class/division of greatest hazard present, any applicable
electromagnetic radiation (EMR) hazards, and evacuation distances/assembly point in the event
of an emergency.
7.20.1. Explosives hazard class division (HC/D) 1.3 or higher will not be carried into public
areas except when responding to an incident where the items are required.
7.26.2.2. Explosives Ordnance Disposal (EOD) will provide training on an annual basis to
personnel whose duties require them to initiate simulators or smoke producing munitions.
Simulator munitions training must include a supervised hands-on evaluation following approved
classroom academic instruction.
7.26.2.3. All persons trained to initiate simulator munitions, including EOD-certified trainers,
will receive an AF Form 483, Certificate of Competency, listing qualified munitions. A current
AF Form 483 is required before receiving, handling or initiating simulator or smoke producing
munitions. Also, all personnel must have explosive safety training prior to handling explosives.
7.26.3. Ensure at least one serviceable 2A:10BC (or greater) fire extinguisher is available for
immediate use.
7.26.4.1. If operations are conducted in a high traffic area, block off the area to ensure personnel
do not come closer than the minimum safe separation distances in AFMAN 91-201.
7.27.4. (Added) Store simulator munitions in properly licensed locations in accordance with
AFMAN 91-201. Do not exceed designated quantities or types listed on the AF Form 2047.
7.27.5. (Added) All transportation of munitions will be in accordance with AFMAN 91-201.
7.27.5.1. (Added) Do not transport more than 10 ground burst simulators at any one time in
government contracted rental vehicles. Notify the fire department of make, model, registration
and license number of all rental vehicles transporting simulators. Do not transport munitions in
privately owned vehicles.
7.27.5.2. (Added) Use the most direct route when transporting simulator munitions. Do not
leave munitions unattended in vehicles. Do not refuel vehicles while carrying simulator
munitions.
7.31.1. (Added) Barksdale AFB does not have a flight line munitions holding area. Every effort
must be made to deliver munitions to an aircraft awaiting upload as close to the loading time as
possible. In the event the aircraft cannot be loaded, an empty aircraft parking location properly
sited for explosives may be used to temporarily stage the munitions. Senior munitions managers
and squadron weapons loading supervisors will make every effort to ensure staging time is kept
to a minimum prior to loading. Remove munitions from the flight line as soon as possible after
downloading. Ensure the following guidelines for munitions delivery to the flight line are
followed:
AFMAN91-201_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALEAFBSUP 29 SEPTEMBER 2010                                           3


7.31.1.1. (Added) The total net explosive weight (NEW) will not exceed the maximum
allowable for that site. Follow the guidelines in Attachment 8.
7.31.1.2. (Added) Munitions will not be staged on the flight line for more than 24 hours.
Position the munitions as close to the center of the parking location as possible. Do not park
explosives loaded trailers between aircraft wingtips unless inter-magazine distance can be
achieved. Contact the 2 BW/SEW for appropriate calculations as needed.
7.31.1.3. (Added) Munitions Control will notify the Fire Alarm Communication Center when
munitions are staged and removed from the staging area. Provide the location and highest fire
symbol for the hazards involved.
8.12.2. (Added) The following are designated primary and alternate on-base explosives

 A8.1. All blank spaces on the matrix represent 20,000 lbs NEW. Use the Table moving from
 left to right. To figure the maximum NEW for a given spot, find the row with the CAPA number
 you intend to load and follow it to the point where it intersects with itself (blank). If there are no
 aircraft parked on the adjacent CAPAs the max NEW is 20,000 pounds. If there is an aircraft in
 the CAPA to the left or right, follow the row until it intersects with that CAPA. This is the
 maximum NEW for the site you intend to load. If there are aircraft parked in both to the right
 and the left of the CAPA you intend to load, the maximum NEW will be lower of the two
 numbers to left and the right of the blank. EXAMPLES:
        A8.1.1. If you intend to load CAPA 2 and there is no aircraft on CAPA 1 or CAPA 3, the
        maximum NEW for CAPA 2 is 20,000 lbs.
        A8.1.2. If you intend to load CAPA 2 and there is an aircraft on CAPA 1 only, your max
        NEW for CAPA 2 is 12,311 lbs. If there is an aircraft on CAPA 3 only, your max NEW for
        CAPA 2 is 13,053 lbs.
        A8.1.3. If there aircraft on CAPA 1 and 3 the maximum NEW for CAPA 2 is 12,311 lbs (the
        lower of the two numbers).
 A8.2. CAPA 8 and CAPA 9 may be loaded with 23,000 lbs NEW when there are no aircraft
 present on adjacent CAPAs. Contact 2 BW Weapons Safety Office for additional guidance.
 A8.3. The max NEW for CAPA 4 will be 6,000 lbs when CAPAEX is in use.
