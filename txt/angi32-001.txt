This Air National Guard Instruction (ANGI) implements the Training Site program which
provides Civil Engineers and Force Support Squadrons (FSS) the opportunity to accomplish
contingency and AFS skill level hands-on training requirements that cannot be obtained through
home station training due to complexity of tasks, uniqueness of equipment, and cost of Air
Force-wide implementation to maintain the highest state of readiness possible. It also outlines
and applies the roles and responsibilities of the Air National Guard Installation and Mission
Support Director (NGB/A7), Air National Guard Civil Engineer Readiness Division
(NGB/A7X), Air National Guard Services Division (NGB/A1S), Air National Guard Civil
Engineer Unit Commanders (CC), Rapid Engineers Deployable Heavy Operations Repair
Squadron Engineers (RED HORSE) Squadron Commanders (RHS/CC), Base Civil Engineer
(BCE) and Air National Guard Force Support Squadron Commanders. It will assist commands at
all levels to identify military training and resource requirements to accomplish the completion of
civil engineer contingency and AFS skill level training. This instruction further implements and
establishes criteria In Accordance With (IAW) Air Force Instruction (AFI) 10-201, Status of
