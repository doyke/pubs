1. Roles and Responsibilities
   1.1. The Judge Advocate General (TJAG), AF/JA, develops, coordinates, and executes JA-
   SLRP and essential procedural guidance for managing and implementing JA-SLRP.
 2                                                                AFI51-1302 17 MARCH 2014


     1.2. The Professional Development Directorate, Office of The Judge Advocate General,
     (AF/JAX):
        1.2.1. Manages and administers the program;
        1.2.2. Verifies and inputs judge advocate’s eligibility requirements;
        1.2.3. Verifies and certifies that first-year applications and subsequent reapplications are
        complete and meet all requirements;
        1.2.4. Verifies payment amounts;
        1.2.5. Approves payment; and
        1.2.6. Prepares and processes payment vouchers.
     1.3. Legal Information Services, Air Force Legal Operations Agency (AFLOA/JAS),
     develops, maintains and updates the JA-SLRP System on Federal Legal Information Through
     Electronics (FLITE).
     1.4. Judge Advocates.
        1.4.1. Judge advocates must review this instruction before requesting counseling from
        their supervisor or AF/JAX. JA-SLRP is not an entitlement and is contingent on funding
        and on TJAG’s approval.
        1.4.2. While AF/JAX attempts to contact all judge advocates who become eligible for
        JA-SLRP, each judge advocate is responsible for confirming their JA-SLRP eligibility
        with AF/JAX and for monitoring their eligibility deadlines.
        1.4.3. Judge advocates are responsible for ensuring JA-SLRP payments are properly
        reported and taxed as income. A Supplemental W-2 recording the withholding is sent to
        applicable judge advocates. Judge advocates must request the Supplemental W-2 if one
        is not received by the end of January of the following year. Failure to receive the proper
        tax documentation does not relieve a judge advocate from tax liability.
        1.4.4. Judge advocates must provide the necessary documentation to meet the eligibility
        criteria. AF/JAX may request additional documentation in certain cases. Failure to
        provide requested documentation may make judge advocates ineligible for JA-SLRP.
2. Eligibility
     2.1. Judge advocates who meet the requirements in this instruction and who apply within
     their applicable eligibility windows as outlined in Table 4.1 are eligible for JA-SLRP.
     2.2. Completed Year of Service. Each completed year of service refers to a judge advocate’s
     first, second, and third years of AFJAGC service. Judge advocates become eligible for JA-
     SLRP after completing their first, second, and third year of AFJAGC service, beginning the
     day after that year’s anniversary of their Extended Active Duty (EAD) date as a judge
     advocate for eligible direct appointees, with and without prior service, and Reserve Officer
     Training Corps (ROTC) graduates, date designated as a judge advocate for eligible Excess
     Leave Program (ELP) judge advocates, or effective transfer date for eligible intraservice and
     interservice transfers.
AFI51-1302 17 MARCH 2014                                                                       3


  2.3. Eligibility Criteria. Judge advocates must meet the following requirements for each
  completed year of AFJAGC service:
     2.3.1. Be an active duty Air Force officer;
     2.3.2. Be qualified, designated, and serving as a judge advocate, as defined in Title 10
     United States Code Section 801 and Title 10 United States Code Section 8067;
     2.3.3. Be serving in an initial AFJAGC active duty service commitment (ADSC) of at
     least four years;
     2.3.4. Do not become eligible for Judge Advocate Continuation Pay (JACP) or other
     bonus during the qualifying year of service, regardless of whether that bonus is applied
     for or not;
     2.3.5. Have a qualifying loan in accordance with paragraph 2.6; and
     2.3.6. Maintain the highest levels of ethical, professional and personal conduct and legal
     proficiency. Acts or omissions that constitute a failure to adhere to these standards may
     result in disqualification from JA-SLRP eligibility.
  2.4. Restrictions. Judge advocates are ineligible for JA-SLRP, if they:
     2.4.1. Attended Judge Advocate Staff Office Course (JASOC) prior to Class 2010-A,
     unless they accessed as an Air Reserve Component (ARC) judge advocate, attended
     JASOC initially as an ARC judge advocate and subsequently entered active duty as a
     judge advocate after 1 October 2010.
     2.4.2. Are eligible for JACP or other bonus during JA-SLRP eligibility, regardless of
     whether they apply for the bonus.
     2.4.3. Entered AFJAGC under the Funded Legal Education Program (FLEP). However,
     if a judge advocate initially attended law school under the ELP, but completed law school
     under the FLEP, that judge advocate may be eligible for JA-SLRP payments for a period
     equal to the number of years the judge advocate attended law school under the ELP.
     These judge advocates must also meet the eligibility criteria outlined in paragraphs 2.2,
     2.3 and 2.6.
     2.4.4. Accessed as an interservice transfer and served as a judge advocate prior to the
     interservice transfer.
     2.4.5. Previously separated or transferred from active duty AFJAGC.
     2.4.6. Previously received pre-commissioning compensation under Title 10 United States
     Code Sections 2106, 2107 or 2107a or financial assistance under Title 10 United States
     Code Sections 2173, 16301 or 16302, until that service obligation is completed. Once
     that obligation is completed, judge advocates may be eligible for JA-SLRP.
     2.4.7. Previously received financial assistance under Title 10 United States Code 2171.
  2.5. ADSC. Judge advocates who participate in JA-SLRP must be serving in their initial
  AFJAGC ADSC, of at least four years, and must complete their initial ADSC on active duty
  in AFJAGC. Participation in JA-SLRP does not result in an additional ADSC, however,
  judge advocates who separate prior to completing their initial four years may not be entitled
 4                                                                AFI51-1302 17 MARCH 2014


     JA-SLRP. Judge advocates become eligible for JA-SLRP after completing first, second and
     third years in AFJAGC.
     2.6. Eligible Loans. The following educational loans are eligible for repayment:
        2.6.1. Any loan made, insured, or guaranteed under part B of Title IV of the Higher
        Education Act of 1965 (Title 20 United States Code Section 1071, et seq.);
        2.6.2. Any loan made under part D of such title (the William D. Ford Federal Direct
        Loan Program, Title 20 United States Code Section 1087a, et seq).;
        2.6.3. Any loan made under part E of such title (20 USC § 1087aa, et seq.); or
        2.6.4. Any loan incurred for educational purposes made by a lender that is:
            2.6.4.1. An agency or instrumentality of a State;
            2.6.4.2. A financial or credit institution (including an insurance company) that is
            subject to examination and supervision by an agency of the United States or any
            State;
            2.6.4.3. A pension fund approved by the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel
            and Readiness for the purposes of this program; or
            2.6.4.4. A non-profit private entity designated by a State, regulated by such State,
            and approved by the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness for the
            purposes of this program.
     2.7. Existing Loans. Only loans in existence on a judge advocate’s EAD for direct
     appointees and ROTC graduates, date designated as a judge advocate for ELP or effective
     transfer date for eligible intraservice and interservice transfers are eligible for JA-SLRP.
     2.8. Consolidation. Eligible loans that are consolidated or restructured after the eligibility
     dates may also be eligible for JA-SLRP. Only the eligible judge advocate’s educational loans
     qualify for repayment under JA-SLRP. If a judge advocate consolidated, or consolidates, his
     or her educational loan(s) with another person’s (e.g., a spouse’s) educational loan(s), only
     the eligible judge advocate’s portion of the resulting consolidated loan qualifies for
     repayment under JA-SLRP. The eligible judge advocate must provide documentation that
     clearly establishes what part of the remaining unpaid principal is attributable to the judge
     advocate’s educational loans. If the judge advocate is not able to establish which portion of
     the consolidated loan is attributable to the judge advocate’s eligible student loan debt, the
     consolidated loan will not qualify for repayment under JA-SLRP.
     2.9. Good standing. Only educational loans that are in good standing, as defined by the
     lender, are eligible for JA-SLRP. Judge advocates may defer or forbear loan payments, as
     long as the loan remains in good standing with the lender.
     2.10. Loan Obligation. Eligibility for JA-SLRP does not relieve judge advocates from
     continuing to satisfy their loan obligations.
3. Payments
     3.1. Program Maximum. Eligible judge advocates may not receive more than $65,000.00 in
     total JA-SLRP payments. Those payments are divided among three years and will not
AFI51-1302 17 MARCH 2014                                                                       5


   exceed $21,666.67 for each of the first and second years of AFJAGC service and $21,666.66
   for the third year of AFJAGC service.
   3.2. Statutory Maximum. In addition to the program maximums described in paragraph 3.1,
   JA-SLRP payments are limited to 33 1/3 percent of a loan’s outstanding unpaid principal or
   $1,500.00, whichever is greater, for each completed year of service, unless the unpaid
   principal balance is less than $1,500.00. In that case, a JA-SLRP payment cannot exceed that
   loan’s remaining unpaid principal balance.
   3.3. Adjusted Unpaid Principal Balance. For AFJAGC Service Years 2 and 3 JA-SLRP
   payments, the amount that is withheld in income tax from the prior AFJAGC service year(s)
   payments is part of the total JA-SLRP disbursement for prior year(s) and must be subtracted
   from the verified remaining unpaid principal balance prior to calculating the AFJAGC
   Service Year 2 and Year 3 JA-SLRP payment. See Figure 3.1.
   3.4. Maximum Yearly Payment. A judge advocate’s JA-SLRP payment each year will be no
   more than the lesser of the program maximum or the statutory maximum.
   3.5. Multiple Loans Priority. For judge advocates with multiple loans, each eligible loan is
   reviewed in prioritized order. Judge advocates must determine their loans’ priority each year.
   For eligible loans with JA-SLRP payments less than the program maximum, those individual
   JA-SLRP payments will be added until their sum reaches the program maximum. See Figure
   3.2.
   3.6. Payment Method. JA-SLRP payments are made directly to the judge advocate’s
   educational loan lender or holder. Payments will not be made to the judge advocate.
   3.7. Federal and State Income Tax Liability. JA-SLRP payments are subject to federal and
   state income taxes in the year they are made to the lender. A percentage of each loan
   payment will be withheld as federal income taxes, reducing the amount paid to the lender.
   The full amount of the payment, however, counts toward the maximum program and
   statutory limitations described above. Figure 3.1 explains the impact of federal income tax
   withholdings on JA-SLRP payments in subsequent years. Judge advocates are responsible for
   complying with state requirements to report and pay taxes on JA-SLRP payments. State
   taxes are not withheld from JA-SLRP payments.
   3.8. Interest. After a JA-SLRP payment is applied to a judge advocate’s educational loan,
   interest on the remainder of the educational loan shall accrue as specified by the judge
   advocate’s lender.
   3.9. Post-9/11 GI Bill. For each year of service a judge advocate accepts JA-SLRP, that year
   of service does not count as qualifying active duty service for Post-9/11 GI Bill eligibility.
   Each completed year of service refers to a judge advocate’s first, second, and third years of
   AFJAGC service. See Department of Defense Instruction 1341.13, Post-9/11 GI Bill and AFI
   36-2306, Voluntary Education Program.
Figure 3.1. Example of JA-SLRP Payment Calculations over 3 Years


JA-SLRP Payment at the end of AFJAGC Service Year 1: The judge advocate’s lender verifies
an educational loan has a remaining unpaid principal of $90,000.00 at the conclusion of the
judge advocate’s first year of AFJAGC service. The program maximum is $21,666.67. The

statutory maximum for this $90,000.00 balance is $30,000.00. Since the statutory maximum
exceeds the program maximum, the judge advocate’s JA-SLRP benefit will be the program
maximum of $21,666.67. $5,416.67 (25%) is withheld and the lender receives $16,250.00.

JA-SLRP Payment at the end of AFJAGC Service Year 2: This example assumes the judge
advocate’s educational loan was in deferment or forbearance during the second year of AFJAGC
service and the judge advocate did not make any payments on the educational loan. The judge
advocate’s lender verifies the educational loan has a remaining unpaid principal of $73,750.00
(AFJAGC Service Year 1’s verified remaining unpaid principal of $90,000.00 less JA-SLRP
Year 1’s lender payment of $16,250.00). The $5,416.67 withheld in income taxes from the
AFJAGC Service Year 1 JA-SLRP payment is part of the total JA-SLRP disbursement for
AFJAGC Service Year 1 and must be subtracted from the verified remaining unpaid principal
prior to calculating Year 2 JA-SLRP payment. Therefore, the adjusted verified remaining unpaid
principal is $68,333.33 ($73,750.00 less $5,416.67). The program maximum is $21,666.67. The
statutory maximum for this $68,333.33 balance is $22,777.78. The statutory maximum exceeds
the program maximum, so the judge advocate’s JA-SLRP benefit will be the program maximum
of $21,666.67. $5,416.67 (25%) is withheld and the lender receives $16,250.00.

          2    $73,750.00       $21,666.67    $22,777.78     $5,416.67       $16,250.00


JA-SLRP Payment at the end of AFJAGC Service Year 3: This example assumes the judge
advocate’s educational loan was in deferment or forbearance during the third year of AFJAGC
service and the judge advocate did not make any payments on the educational loan. The judge
advocate’s lender verifies the educational loan has a remaining unpaid principal of $57,500.00
(AFJAGC Service Year 2’s verified remaining unpaid principal of $73,750.00 less AFJAGC
Service Year 2’s lender payment of $16,250.00). As in the JA-SLRP Year 2 calculations, the
federal income tax withholding from JA-SLRP Years 1 and 2 disbursements must be subtracted
from the verified remaining unpaid principal prior to calculating Year 3 JA-SLRP payment.
Therefore, the adjusted verified remaining unpaid principal is $46,666.66 ($57,500.00 less the
federal income tax withholding for AFJAGC Service Years 1 and 2 of $10,833.34). The
program maximum is $21,666.66. The statutory maximum for this $46,666.66 balance is
$15,555.55. Since the program maximum exceeds the statutory maximum, the judge advocate’s
lender will be paid the statutory maximum, less the federal income tax withholding. $3,888.89
AFI51-1302 17 MARCH 2014                                                                       7


(25%) is withheld in taxes and the lender receives $11,666.66.

Summary: The judge advocate’s student loan in this example started at a remaining unpaid
principal of $90,000.00. The judge advocate was eligible for JA-SLRP payments totaling
$58,888.89. The lender received $44,166.66 and $14,722.23 was withheld for federal income
tax.


Figure 3.2. Example of JA-SLRP Year 1 Payment Calculations with Multiple Loans
Year 1 JA-SLRP Payment with Multiple Loans: The judge advocate’s lenders verify five
eligible educational loans with remaining unpaid principals of $2,000.00, $6,000.00, $12,000.00,
$500.00 and $60,000.00, respectively, at the end of the judge advocate’s first year of AFJAGC
service. The judge advocate decides to prioritize his or her loans for repayment in that same
order listed. Each loan JA-SLRP payment is then calculated in order until the statutory or
program maximum is met, whichever is sooner.
The first JA-SLRP payment is calculated for Loan 1. JA-SLRP payment is $1,500.00 since
$1,500.00 is greater than $666.67, or 33 1/3 percent of $2,000.00. The lender receives $1,125.00
and $375.00 is withheld for taxes, assuming a 25% tax rate. Since the statutory maximum is
$1,500.00 for Loan 1 and less than the program maximum of $21,666.67, Loan 2 may be
considered.
The Loan 2 JA-SLRP payment will be 33 1/3 percent of $6,000.00 or $2,000.00, with $1,500.00
paid to lender and $500.00 withheld for taxes. Since the sum of the two loan payments is now
$3,500.00 ($1,500.00 plus $2,000.00) and still below the program maximum of $21,666.67,
Loan 3 may be considered.
The Loan 3 JA-SLRP payment will be 33 1/3 percent of $12,000.00 or $4,000.00, with
$3,000.00 paid to the lender and $1,000.00 withheld for taxes. Since the sum statutory
maximum for Loans 1, 2 and 3 is $7,500.00 ($1,500.00 plus $2,000.00 plus $4,000.00) and still
below the program maximum of $21,666.67, Loan 4 may be considered.
The Loan 4 JA-SLRP payment will be $500.00 since the unpaid principal balance is less than
$1,500.00, with $375.00 going to the lender and $125.00 withheld for taxes. Since the sum
statutory maximum for Loans 1-4 is $8,000.00 ($1,500.00 plus $2,000.00 plus $4,000.00 plus
$500.00) and still below the program maximum of $21,666.67, Loan 5 may be considered.
For Loan 5, 33 1/3 percent of $60,000.00 is $20,000.00. But since the sum of the statutory
maximum for Loans 1-5 is $28,000.00 and exceeds the sum program maximum of $21,666.67,

4. Application Process
     4.1. Eligibility Window. Judge advocates who meet the eligibility requirements in
     paragraph 2 must review Table 4.1 to determine their eligibility window.
        4.1.1. Judge advocates, who fail to submit an application for payment each year during
        their eligibility window, will be ineligible for that completed year of service’s JA-SLRP
        payment, as well as any future JA-SLRP payments.
        4.1.2. Declination will result in ineligibility for the completed year of service, as well as
        any future JA-SLRP payments.
        4.1.3. Judge advocates must apply during their JA-SLRP eligibility window prior to
        receiving payments for the first year, as well as re-apply during their application window
        for the second and third years of completed service.

Table 4.1. Annual Application Eligibility Windows.

    advocate for eligible ELPs, or effective
    transfer date for eligible intraservice and
    interservice transfers and extending for 90

    interservice transfers and extending for 90
    calendar days thereafter
  4.2. Application. Judge advocates apply for JA-SLRP through the JA-SLRP System located
  on FLITE. Each yearly application or re-application must include:
     4.2.1. Proof of AFJAGC professional responsibility in the form of a certificate of
     professional responsibility for that year or a history of professional responsibility that
     includes that eligibility year;
     4.2.2. Promissory note or other equivalent document for each loan; and
     4.2.3. Signed and completed DD Form 2475, DoD Educational Loan Repayment
     Program (LRP) Annual Application, or lender verification memorandum for each loan.
     See Attachment 2.
  4.3. Routing. JA-SLRP applications submitted in the JA-SLRP System are forwarded
  directly to AF/JAX through FLITE. AF/JAX reviews verification memoranda and/or DD
  Form 2475s after they have been uploaded into JA-SLRP on FLITE and verifies that
  applications are complete and that eligibility is met. Incomplete applications will be returned,
  through the JA-SLRP System, to judge advocates with a notice to provide the missing data.
  4.4. Approval. Upon approval of the applications, judge advocates will receive a JA-SLRP
  System notification of the approval. The judge advocates’ notifications will include a link to
  the decision reports, which will detail payment information.
  4.5. Appeals. The Director, Professional Development Directorate, is the appellate authority
  for JA-SLRP eligibility and payments.
     4.5.1. Each judge advocate will have an opportunity to appeal the total JA-SLRP
     payment and/or individual lender disbursements through the JA-SLRP System on FLITE.
     If the judge advocate does not appeal, the judge advocate must indicate this decision in
     the JA-SLRP System, as all further processing of JA-SLRP payments is suspended until
     the judge advocate elects whether or not to appeal.
     4.5.2. If AF/JAX determines that a judge advocate is ineligible for a JA-SLRP payment,
     AF/JAX will deny the application. Upon denial, the JA-SLRP System will automatically
10                                                            AFI51-1302 17 MARCH 2014


     notify judge advocates of the denial and provide them an opportunity to appeal the denial
     through the JA-SLRP System on FLITE.
  4.6. Lender Verification. During their eligibility window each year, judge advocates must
  obtain from their lenders verification of their educational loan’s unpaid principal balance.
  Refer to Table 4.1 for eligibility windows. Judge advocates must submit either a signed and
  completed DD Form 2475 or a signed and completed lender verification memorandum
  (Attachment 2) for each loan. A separate form or memorandum is required for each loan and
  each loan holder or lender and must be submitted when applying.
     4.6.1. If submitting a DD Form 2475, judge advocates must complete Sections 2 and 3 of
     the form. They must also check “Active Duty LRP” for the Loan Program and list their
     own mailing address and fax number in Section 1, a., to ensure that the form is returned
     to them directly and in time to qualify for payment. The judge advocate’s staff judge
     advocate, deputy staff judge advocate, functional supervisor or AF/JAX signs Section 1,
     b. The lending institution completes Section 4.
