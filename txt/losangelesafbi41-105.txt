re-designated as the PAD program. Paragraph 1 was added and numbering sequence updated.
This revision replaces 61st Air Base Wing (61 ABW) with 61st Air Base Group (61 ABG), 61st
Medical Group (61 MDG) with 61st Medical Squadron. Paragraph 2.1 and 2.2 was added to
describe the responsibilities of the SMC/CV and Group/Squadron Commanders, SMC Directors,
and Tenant Organizations respectively. IAW SMC/JA review, paragraph 2.5 was revised to
clarify laws and regulations used as references for this publication. The roles and responsibilities
of the medical director (paragraph 2.5 and its subparagraphs), the program coordinator
(paragraph 2.6 and its subparagraphs), Site Coordinators (paragraph 2.7 and its subparagraphs),
and Targeted Responders (paragraph 2.8 and its subparagraphs) were expanded and a special
note was added about funding of replacement supplies and equipment. Paragraphs 3, 4, 5, and 6
were added. Paragraph 2 was renamed Routine Maintenance and moved to paragraph 8.
Paragraph 4 was renamed PAD Equipment and Supplies, moved to paragraph 7 and the
equipment list revised. Paragraph 3 was moved to paragraph 9 and additional requirements
added regarding ongoing evaluation and monitoring of compliance with this policy. Attachment

     targeted responders should follow Heartsaver PAD treatment protocols.
     2.8.3. Complete LAAFB IMT-7 and forward to the site coordinator immediately after the
     PAD is used.
3. PROCEDURES:
  3.1. Post-event Assessment:
     3.1.1. Ensure the completed LAAFB IMT-7 is faxed/scanned to the PAD program
     coordinator within 24 hours of the PAD being used. The purpose of this form is to
     document the use of the PAD and provide information on the event to the medical
     director and program coordinator for review.
     3.1.2. Remove the PAD from service and sequester to protect event data. Place a sign
     over the temporarily missing device box with directions to the closest functioning PAD.
4. EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS AND EVALUATION:
  4.1. To validate skills of the site coordinators and the targeted responders, mock cardiac
  arrest exercises requiring adult CPR and use of the PAD will be conducted quarterly by the
  PAD program coordinator. These quarterly mock exercises may be conducted in conjunction
  with base exercises, and sections may be targeted randomly. It is therefore imperative that
  each site coordinator regularly performs a self-assessment in response to a cardiac emergency
  event, proper use of the PAD and completion of the event summary.
  4.2. Feedback will be provided either on the spot or at the end of the exercise to the site
  coordinator, the targeted responders of the section tested.
  4.3. Major deviations may require retraining of site coordinator/targeted responders and
  reevaluation within 3 months of the mock cardiac arrest exercise. NOTE: An example of a
  major deviation include but not limited to failure to clear area before delivering a
  recommended shock.
5. TRAINING/RE-TRAINING:
  5.1. Site coordinators and targeted responders are expected to obtain training in adult CPR
  and use of PAD through a nationally recognized organization every 2 years.
  5.2. Training in adult CPR and AED can be arranged through the 61 MDS Education and
  Training Office by calling: 653-6673.
6. PROCUREMENT:
  6.1. Replacement of the PAD, batteries, cables, equipment and supplies will be funded by
  the assigned unit (i.e., the site coordinators unit will fund this requirement).

    6.2. PADs are considered medical equipment and must be prescribed for use by lay
    responders. Procurement of PADs must be approved by the medical director prior to release
    of the PAD to the unit.
    6.3. The 61 MDS BMET must be consulted to determine the PAD model and type to ensure
    the procuring unit is aware of all procedures to purchase and maintain the PAD and
    associated supplies and equipment.
    6.4. Requesting PAD Replacement: Replacement PADs will be requested through the PAD
    program coordinator.
    6.5. Requesting PAD Placement in a New Location: Units that request a PAD program and
    placement of the PAD may request evaluation placement by a written request to the 61
    MDS/CC (E-mail is acceptable) providing justification. The 61 MDS/CC will evaluate the
    proposed area (population at risk, logistics of maintaining personnel qualifications, and PAD
    maintenance), consult with the PAD program coordinator and make recommendations to the
    61 ABG/CC. New PAD purchases and supplies will be funded by the requesting unit.
7. PAD EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES:
    7.1. The PAD will be maintained in a location arranged by the program coordinator, the
    medical director and the site coordinator. It will not be moved to a new location without the
    consent of the 61 MDS PAD program coordinator. The PAD and associated supplies will be
    kept in an alarmed wall cabinet.
    7.2. The following equipment will be purchased and stored with the PAD:
       7.2.1. Adult PAD pads – 2.

Terms
Automated External Defibrillator—is a portable electronic device that automatically diagnoses
the potentially life threatening cardiac arrhythmias of ventricular defibrillation and ventricular
tachycardia in a patient, and is able to treat them through defibrillation.
Defibrillation—the application of electrical therapy which stops the arrhythmia, allowing the
heart to reestablish an effective rhythm.
Public Access Defibrillator—the deployment of automatic external defibrillators in public
facilities for the use by laypersons to provide early intervention to victims of cardiac arrest.
