                                 PROGRAM ELEMENTS

1.1. ADSCs (General). ADSCs fulfill two very important functions. They assure the Air Force
and the taxpayers receive an appropriate return for their investment of money and/or time in
training, education, and bonuses. This includes training not provided by the Air Force. Law
establishes some ADSCs; policy establishes others. ADSCs also communicate to Air Force
members the periods of obligated service they must complete before becoming eligible to
separate or retire from active duty.
   1.1.1. The Air Force establishes ADSCs for all active duty members who participate in
   ADSC-incurring events. As such, it is imperative that ADSCs and associated policies in this
   instruction be clearly communicated by responsible officials and fully understood by Air
   Force members.
   1.1.2. Officers in the grades of colonel and below and all enlisted personnel incur ADSCs
   when they complete all or a portion of ADSC-incurring events.
   1.1.3. Members usually serve new ADSCs concurrently with existing ADSCs. However,
   members serve ADSCs for Funded Legal Education Program/Excess Leave Program
   (FLEP/ELP) (Table 1.1.), Educational Leave of Absence (ELA) program (Table 1.1.) and
   health professions officer education/training (Table 1.2.) after fulfilling all previously
   existing initial ADSCs and in accordance with special pays which require a contractual
   agreement as prescribed by ASD(HA).
   1.1.4. An ADSC does not establish and is independent of a date of separation.
       1.1.4.1. Enlisted personnel serve on active duty in accordance with their enlistment
       contracts.
       1.1.4.2. Officers usually serve indefinite active duty tours by appointment of the
       President and must request release or discharge from their appointment from the
       Secretary of the Air Force. Needs of the Air Force may require continued service beyond
       an ADSC.
   1.1.5. Time spent in an excess leave status does not count toward fulfilling ADSCs.
   1.1.6. An ADSC is not affected by a change in member’s duty AFSC.
       1.1.7. ADSCs incurred for training will become effective upon graduation date or
       completion of required training for specialty (i.e. award of aeronautical rating).

NOTES:
1. The following provisions apply:
a. The ADSC for Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) will be 10 years effective for those entering UPT
on or after 1 October 1999. The ADSC will be served upon graduation and will run concurrently with
any other ADSC. The United States Air Force Academy classes of 1998 and 1999, and Air Force
Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) cadets commissioned in Fiscal Year (FY) 1998 and 1999
who were categorized as pilots at EAD entry, will incur an ADSC of 8 years (versus 10 years) upon
completion of UPT.
b. All manned or unmanned pilots, navigators, and air battle managers who began aviation service after
30 September 1997 will not incur any additional Advanced Flying Training (AFT)/Instructor
Qualification ADSCs which extend beyond 6 or 10 years as applicable, of continuous or cumulative rated
service. Rated service begins at the completion of training and awarding of wings for the rated specialty.
They will still incur Permanent Change of Station (PCS), Professional Military Education (PME), and
other non-AFT related ADSCs.
c. Rated officers who crossflow/retrain into another rated career field (e.g., an air battle manager who
crossflows/retrains as a navigator or manned or unmanned pilot), crossflow/retrain to a different weapons
system (basic qualification) or aircraft airframe will incur the full ADSC for that training even if that
ADSC extends beyond the officer’s 6th or 10th year of rated service.
2. Upon formal withdrawal or elimination from the program, members incur an ADSC of two years, or
the ADSC for completion of the program, whichever is less. ADSC will be updated from projected
graduation date of course with ADSC code 33. (Exception: AFROTC cadets who withdraw or eliminate
incur the ADSC set out in AFI 36-2011, Air Force Reserve Officer
Training Corps. USAFA cadets who withdraw or eliminate incur the ADSC set out in AFI 36-2020,
Disenrollment of USAFA Cadets. OTS cadets who withdraw or eliminate incur no ADSC IAW AFI 36-
2013, Officer Training School (OTS) and Airman Commissioning Program.
3. FLEP/ELP ADSC begins upon completion of any other unfulfilled ADSC, (e.g., EAD). Additionally,
no portion of the education period (including legal internship) may satisfy any existing ADSC.
Exception: The ADSC for initial PCS to Law School is fulfilled during the education period.
4. FLEP students who withdraw or eliminate must serve one year for each year, or part thereof, of
participation in the program. ELP students who withdraw or eliminate must serve one month for each
month of participation in the program.
5. Excludes ―low-cost‖ and ―no-cost‖ PCS. Exception: Permissive and Humanitarian PCS still incur an
ADSC. Humanitarian PCS ADSC may be reduced to a six-month commitment if a hardship condition
exists after PCS move. Members may request adjustment of ADSC through their MPS assignments
section. Members who retrain in conjunction with a CONUS-to-CONUS assignment or who PCS as part
of a force-structure/unit move may have their ADSC reduced to a one year commitment if the member is
ineligible to obtain the required retainability.
6. Examples of federally-sponsored fellowships include, but are not limited to, Secretary of Defense
Corporate Fellowships, National Defense Fellowships, RAND Research Fellowships, White House
Fellowships, Legislative Fellowships, Council on Foreign Relations Fellowships, and National Security
Fellowships.
7. Upon approval by AFIT Civilian Institution Programs office in coordination with AF/A1DL, members
may accept merit-based fellowships, scholarships, and grants sponsored by a corporation, fund
foundation, or educational institution (as prescribed by Title 1. U.S.C. 2603) if it will qualify the member
to fill a potential Air Force requirement. Education in this category includes, but is not limited to,
Olmsted Scholarships, Rhodes Scholarships, Lincoln Lab Grants, Draper Fellowships, and National
 10                                                                        AFI36-2107 30 April 2012


Science Foundation Research Fellowships. Participants in the Olmsted Scholarship Program incur an
ADSC equal to three times the length of training spent in graduate study in a foreign country, effective
upon completion of this assignment.
8. ROTC students who accept extended scholarship entitlements serve an additional ADSC for EAD
equivalent to the length of the entitlement extension, per DoDI 1215.8.
9. AFIT students who are attending AFIT on a part-time basis will not incur an ADSC for completion of
AFIT courses.
10. ABMs attending initial qualification training fall under rules 14 & 15. ABMs attending
requalification training fall under rule 16.
11. For AFIT students attending civilian institutions, this ADSC will normally begin upon graduation.
However, failure to complete a thesis or dissertation is not considered formal elimination or withdrawal if
all requisite coursework has been completed and will not excuse a member from serving the full
prescribed ADSC.
12. This rule is in effect for officers entering this training after 11 Mar 02.
13. For promotion to the grades of E-7 and E-8, an ADSC will only be incurred for selectees with more
than 18 years of total active federal military service (TAFMS). Promotion to the grade of E-9 will incur
an ADSC regardless of TAFMS. Demotion action does not automatically relieve an enlisted member of
an ADSC previously incurred for promotion.
14. ADSC information for training courses are listed in the Education and Training Course
Announcement (ETCA) website at (https://etca.randolph.af.mil) or via the Oracle Training
Announcement (OTA) database within MilPDS.
15. Members selected for in-unit or unit funded courses will still incur any applicable ADSC for those
courses. For courses not updated in OTA, the base MPS will forward HQ AFPC/DPTO the member’s
name, SSAN, course ID, class start date and class graduation date. HQ AFPC/DPTO will create an AF
Form 63 for the ADSC event.
16. Applies to Combat Rescue and Special Tactics officers (CRO/STO) who enter initial qualification on
or after 1 May 2007. The ADSC for CRO will be associated with AETC course L3ABPIT231 0P4A
(Pararescue Apprentice Course). The ADSC for STO will be associated with AFSOC course AFSOC
Advanced Skills Training (AST).
17. ADSC will be 4 years with the following exceptions:
a. For those individuals eligible for retirement on 1 August 2009, no additional service is required.
b. For those individuals who have an approved retirement date after 1 August 2009 and before 1 July
2010, no additional service is required.
c. For those individuals eligible for retirement after 1 August 2009 and before 1 August 2010, 1 year of
additional service is required.
d. For those individuals eligible for retirement on or after 1 August 2010 and before August 2011, 2 years
of additional service is required.
e. For those individuals eligible for retirement on or after 1 August 2011 and before 1 August 2012, 3
years of additional service is required.
18. A service member is considered to be "retirement eligible" if he or she has completed 20 years of
active Federal service or 20 qualifying years as computed under 10 U.S.C. Section 12732. Personnel who
applied, on or before 1 August 09, for Post-9/11 GI Bill transfer of educational benefits have an ADSC
start date of 1 August 09. Personnel applying after 1 August 2009 will have an ADSC start date on the
date the transfer application was submitted.

their first major weapons system.
21. Pilots who cross-train without a break in flying between AETC non-Major Weapons System aircraft,
after completing initial training do not incur any additional commitment.

NOTES:
 The ADO’s for all health care provider special and incentive pays, and accession and retention bonuses
which require contractual agreements, shall be in accordance with Chapter 5 of Chapter 37, USC, and as
prescribed by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs under guidance of DODI 6000.13
1. Members who withdraw or eliminate incur an ADSC of 2 years or the length of time in training,
whichever is greater, not to exceed the ADSC for program completion.
2. Members who withdraw or eliminate incur an ADSC of 3 years or the length of time in training,
whichever is greater, not to exceed the ADSC for program completion.
3. Do not use any part of the educational or training program period to satisfy any existing ADSC.
4. Members serve this ADSC after fulfilling all previously existing educational or initial accession
ADSCs.
5. Obligation is 1 year for each year of scholarship with minimum of 2 years obligation for MC/DC, or
minimum 3 years obligation for other Corps, then 6 months for each 6-month increment thereafter
concurrent with minimum term of service requirement. Extensions of training (beyond original approved
completion date) will also result in ½ year of each ½ year extension or portion thereafter.
6. Clinical Fellowships may authorize sub-specialization suffix to the parent (primary) 4-digit AFSC
upon completion of the clinical fellowship program, OR fellowship training may be limited to only a
single 3-digit AFSC career field. Non-clinical Fellowships do not provide sub-specialization suffix to the
parent (primary) 4-digit AFSC upon completion of the non-clinical fellowship program, OR fellowship
training may be open to more than one 3-digit AFSC career field.
7. Required to fulfill 3 year minimum term of service
8. For AFIT students attending civilian institutions, this ADSC will normally begin upon graduation.
However, failure to complete a thesis or dissertation is not considered formal elimination or withdrawal if
all requisite coursework has been completed and will not excuse a member from serving the full
prescribed ADSC.
1.3. Advising Members of ADSCs. The Force Support Squadron (FSS) (or delegated
authority) advises members of ADSC commitments and documents acceptance of ADSCs (see
paragraphs 2.5. and 2.6. for health professions officers and judge advocates).
    1.3.1. The AF Form 63 formally documents the member’s knowledge and acceptance of the
    ADSC. For some ADSC-incurring events, a different form of documentation may be
    prescribed. (See paragraph 1.3.2). In the case where a formal notification procedure is not
    followed due to administrative error or oversight, it is each Air Force member’s
    responsibility to know what ADSC they will incur before entering into any associated event.
    Failure to be notified or complete an AF Form 63 (or other prescribed documentation)
    does not relieve the member of the ADSC.
    1.3.2. The following ADSC-incurring events require documentation other than the AF Form
    63:
        1.3.2.1. Entry on Extended Active Duty (EAD) (AFROTC cadets see AFI 36-2011,
        paragraph 3.2.1.7; USAFA cadets, see AFI 36-2019, paragraph 3.12).
        1.3.2.2. Permanent Change of Station (PCS) (see AFI 36-2110, paragraph 2.28).
        Exception: AF Form 63 is required only for members - officer and enlisted - moving
        CONUS-to-CONUS and then only if they are or will become eligible for retirement
        before completing the associated ADSC. In these cases, the AF Form 63 is not to be used
 14                                                                 AFI36-2107 30 April 2012


      as the official assignment notification but should be signed by member within 7 calendar
      days of official notification.
      1.3.2.3. Accepting special and incentive pays (Health professions, see AFI 41-109, or
      Aviator Continuation Pay, see AFI 36-3004, paragraph 2.2.2).
      1.3.2.4. Changing competitive categories (see AFI 36-2106, Attachment 2).
      1.3.2.5. Tuition Assistance (see AFI 36-2107, paragraph 2.7).
      1.3.2.6. Participating in education or training programs listed in Table 1.1. or Table 1.2
      (see AFI 41-117, paragraph 31.1.15).
      1.3.2.7. ADSC-incurring events affecting enlisted personnel. AF Form 63 is required
      only if the member is or will become eligible for retirement before completing the ADSC
      (see AFI 36-2606, paragraph 4.1.1).
      1.3.2.8. Enlisted promotion to E-7, E-8 and E-9 will be documented on a Promotion
      Statement of Understanding (PSU) regardless of member’s TAFMSD.
      1.3.2.9. Rated specialty begins at the completion of training and award of
      wings/aeronautical rating. ADSC is documented within commissioning contract or initial
      rated selection.
1.4. Retainability. Members who accept an ADSC-incurring event must have or obtain
retainability to serve the ADSC required for the event.
   1.4.1. Enlisted members who lack the necessary retainability must obtain it, if eligible,
   through reenlistment or extension. When an enlisted member cannot obtain the retainability
   for an ADSC-incurring event, the Military Personnel Section (MPS) or Education Service
   and Human Resource Flight (DPH) must notify the selection authority and the member may
   apply for a waiver of retainability or Controlled Duty Assignment requirements (AFI 36-
   2110, paragraphs 2.29. and 2.43). Enlisted members who decline to obtain retainability must
   document that decision on AF Form 964, PCS, TDY, or Training Declination Statement (AFI
   36-2110, paragraphs 2.27.2).
   1.4.2. Any officer who has not applied for separation or retirement, and does not have
   sufficient retainability for the ADSC-incurring event, must apply for a sufficient waiver (AFI
   36-2110, paragraphs 2.30.2.).
AFI36-2107 30 April 2012                                                                     15

Section 2B—Procedures

2.12. Completing an AF Form 63 (OPR: FSS).
   2.12.1. Counsel the member on the ADSC using AF Form 63 provided by HQ AFPC/DPTO.
      2.12.1.1. If a member is selected for an ADSC-incurring event and an AF Form 63 is not
      received within 5 duty days from HQ AFPC/DPTO, the MPS must request an AF Form
      63 from HQ AFPC/ DPTO via email to afpc.dpsipadscpolicy@randolph.af.mil.
      2.12.1.2. To decline the ADSC, the MPS suspends all processing for the ADSC-
      incurring event and completes the following actions.
          2.12.1.2.1. The MPS contacts HQ AFPC/DPTO immediately.
          2.12.1.2.2. The MPS Chief then signs Section III and includes an ADSC declination
          statement (see paragraph 2.16) in the remarks section of the AF Form 63. The MPS
          will establish a suspense for members to submit a separation or retirement application
          within 7 calendar days of assignment notification (IAW AFI 36-2110).
          2.12.1.2.3. The MPS updates the assignment availability code for enlisted members
          to reflect mandatory separation or retirement at the end of the current enlistment
          contract (IAW AFI 36-2110). Exceptions: Those applying for separation or
          retirement via the vMPF self-service applications, the in-system application
          automatically updates the assignment availability code. If the member is declining
          PCS only and signs an AF Form 964, PCS, TDY or Training Declination Statement,
          an AF Form 63 is not required.
   2.12.2. The MPS distributes copies of the AF Form 63 as follows:
      2.12.2.1. Forwards a signed AF Form 63 to HQ AFPC/DPTO; faxed or emailed copies
      will be accepted and are encouraged. Scanned copy of AF Form 63 may be sent via
      email to: afpc.dpsipadscpolicy@randolph.af.mil. These copies replace the need for the
      original to be mailed.
      2.12.2.2. Gives the member a copy.
      2.12.2.3. Retains original or a copy of the AF Form 63 in a 90-day transitory file.
 18                                                                AFI36-2107 30 April 2012


2.13. Updating the ADSCD and ADSC Reason (RSN) Code (OPR: HQ AFPC/DPSIP, HQ
AFPC/DPTO, and FSS).
   2.13.1. HQ AFPC/DPTO updates MilPDS with ADSCD and ADSC Reason Code for all
   members (except health professions and judge advocate officers) upon receipt of completed
   AF Form 63 or other ADSC documentation. Exception: HQ AFPC/DPTO will update
   ADSCD for the Air Force Intern Program (AFIP) or PME regardless of competitive category.
   Also, HQ AFPC/DPTO will update AFIT ADSCD for judge advocate officers. ADSCD
   begins upon graduation or completion date of training or education, unless otherwise stated.
   ADSCD for CAP positions begin upon duty effective date. ADSCD for rated specialty begins
   at the completion of training and awarding of wings/aeronautical rating.
   2.13.2. If course graduation date changes or the member does not complete the training, the
   MPS will contact HQ AFPC/DPSIP to adjust ADSCD.
   2.13.3. When adjusting a person's service dates to account for lost time (e.g., confinement),
   HQ AFPC/DPSIP will adjust the ADSCD upon receipt of AF Form 2098, Duty Status
   Change, from HQ AFPC/DPSOTED by adding one day for each lost day. HQ AFPC/DPSIP
   will also adjust ADSCDs by adding one day for each day of excess leave.
   2.13.4. The OPR for ADSC MilPDS updates is:
       2.13.4.1. HQ USAF/JAX for Judge advocate officers who participated in the Excess
       Leave Program.
       2.13.4.2. HQ AFPC/DPAM for Health professions officers.
2.14. Verifying the ADSCD on receipt of a notice of establishment or change of ADSCD
Report on Individual Person (RIP) (OPR: FSS).
   2.14.1. Ensure the ADSCD is correct on the RIP. If incorrect contact HQ AFPC/DPSIP.
   2.14.2. Ensure supporting documents are archived in ARMS. If the documentation is not on
   file, the current servicing MPS should immediately advise member of the ADSC and the
   requirement to document it.
   2.14.3. Give the RIP to the member if the ADSCD is correct and the documentation is in
   ARMS.
2.15. Missing Documentation (OPR: FSS). When a member’s personnel records do not
contain an AF Form 63 or other required ADSC acknowledgment for a specific ADSC-incurring
event in which the member participated, the current servicing MPS takes the following actions:
   2.15.1. Contact HQ AFPC/DPTO to determine if HQ AFPC has a copy of the
   documentation.
   2.15.2. If no copies of the documentation are found:
       2.15.2.1. Advise the member using documentation provided by HQ AFPC/DPTO.
       2.15.2.2. When the member in-processes PCS or on temporary duty (TDY) without an
       AF Form 63, contact HQ AFPC/DPTO to issue a Category One Processing Discrepancy
       (see AFI 36-2102, Base-Level Relocation Procedures) to the losing MPS. If the gaining
       MPS allows the member to enter the ADSC-incurring event without requesting an AF
AFI36-2107 30 April 2012                                                                     19


       Form 63, HQ AFPC/DPTO will also charge the gaining MPS with a Category One
       Processing Discrepancy.
2.16. Declining an ADSC (7-day Option). A member who declines the ADSC for PCS or
training must request separation or retirement within 7 calendar days of notification (Excludes
Health Professions Officers sponsored for education in Table 1.2). The MPS Chief is the
briefing official in Section III of the AF Form 63 and will enter the following statement in the
Remarks Section: ―I advised this member concerning the ramifications of declining to accept the
ADSC and the requirement to submit a separation or retirement request. Member has been
advised that if he/she declines but does not establish a DOS or retirement date under the 7-day
option provision (see AFI 36-2110, Assignments), and attends the ADSC-incurring event, he/she
will still incur the associated ADSC.‖ Exception: Officers may decline PME in-residence
without establishing a DOS. Do not document officer PME declination on an AF Form 63.
Refer to HQ AFPC/DPAPE annual PSDM for further guidance on proper officer PME
declination procedures.
   2.16.1. Members who establish a separation or retirement date under the 7-day option policy
   as an alternative to accepting an ADSC, who subsequently complete the ADSC incurring
   event based on needs of the Air Force, are not obligated to serve beyond their established
   DOS or retirement date unless they withdraw their DOS or retirement. Those who decline an
   ADSC and establish a DOS or retirement date must serve all existing ADSCs before
   separation or retirement unless an early release is approved.
2.17. Refusing to sign an ADSC Acknowledgment Form or Statement (Upon Selection for
an ADSC-Incurring event). Members who are properly advised of an ADSC cannot therefore
avoid an ADSC by refusing to sign the AF Form 63 or other acknowledgment statement.
Members who do not establish a DOS or retirement date under the 7-day option and attend or
enter into the ADSC-incurring event are considered to have constructively accepted the ADSC.
2.18. ADSC Waivers. The Secretary of the Air Force or his/her designee may, in appropriate
cases, waive an unfulfilled ADSC when requested by a member in conjunction with applying for
separation or retirement (see AFI 36-3207, Separating Commissioned Officers, AFI 36-3208,
Administrative Separation of Airmen, and AFI 36-3203, Service Retirements).
2.19. Failure to Complete the ADSC for Education, Bonus, or Similar Benefit, Title 37,
U. S.C., Section 303a(e) or Section 373.
   2.19.1. Members incurring an ADSC on or after 1 April 2006 who fail to complete their
   ADSC are subject to recoupment, unless waived by the Secretary, of a prorated portion of the
   cost of educational assistance, financial bonus, or benefit (see AFI 36-3207, Separating
   Commissioned Officers and AFI 36-3203, Service Retirements).
   2.19.2. Members remaining on active duty do not have the option of reimbursing the
   government in lieu of fulfilling an ADSC. Exception: Members who must repay TA in full
   as directed by the government (incomplete/failing grade, class dropped, etc.) may request
   removal of the ADSC. MPS or ESO will confirm recoupment action and coordinate with HQ
   AFPC/DPSIP to remove ADSCD from member’s records.
2.20. Resolving an ADSC discrepancy (Formal Review Process) (OPR: HQ AFPC/DPSIP
or FSS). It is vital members and the Air Force quickly resolves ADSC issues surfaced by the
member, record reviews, or other means. The FSS does not make the final decision on ADSC
 20                                                                   AFI36-2107 30 April 2012


issues (see paragraph 2.20.2.). The OPR should, however, advise members of the information
discovered.
   2.20.1. FSS ensures the review of the member’s record is complete and as a minimum
   complete the following actions:
      2.20.1.1. Review Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) RIP.
      2.20.1.2. Review ARMS for source documents related to MilPDS RIP (AF Form 63,
      Training Allocation RIP, Statement of Understanding or similar document, and PCS
      Notification RIP).
      2.20.1.3. Contact Flight Management Office (FMO) for record of all flying training the
      member has completed. Verifies AFT ADSC in MilPDS is consistent with FMO record
      of flying training.
          2.20.1.4. Contact ESO to verify all ADSCs for tuition assistance are properly
          recorded.
      2.20.1.5. Ensures ARMS contains the appropriate AF Form 63 or other acknowledgment
      and, if missing, follows the steps in paragraph 2.14.
      2.20.1.6. FSS sends the results of the audit to HQ AFPC/DPSIP and requests a review
