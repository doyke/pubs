2. General Information Regarding Airfield Facilities.
   2.1. Runway(s) and Taxiways. The Thule Air Base (BGTL) Airport Reference Point
   (ARP) is located at geographical coordinates 76 31 52.33N 068 42 11.38W. Magnetic
   variation is not applied at Thule AB. All NAVAIDs, runways, instrument approaches,
   vectors and winds are aligned to true north. Non-standard airfield markings are required due
   to arctic conditions. The airfield is painted white with red runway, taxiway and apron
   markings.
      2.1.1. Runway 08/26 is 9,997 feet by 140 feet and made of asphalt. Runway overruns
      are 240 feet by 140 and made of asphalt.
4                                                        THULEABI13-204 27 AUGUST 2014


       2.1.2. Taxiways Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie are 75 feet wide and made of asphalt. Due to
       the slope of the airfield and potential for accumulation of snow and ice, Greenland
       Contractor Airfield Manager (GC/AMO) will determine daily availability of Taxiway
       Charlie.
       2.1.3. Field elevation is 251 feet. Note: Airfield Diagram Depicting Runway/Taxiway
       Designations, runway length, width and surface type, Field Elevation/Gradient,
       Designation of Primary Instrument Runway, Depiction of Critical Areas, Intersection
       Departure Distances, and Instrument Hold Lines (INST) is depicted in (Attachment 2).
    2.2. Runway Selection Procedures. For primary runway operations, aircraft will land
    Runway 08 and depart Runway 26. Any deviation from this procedure requires prior
    coordination with Air Traffic Control (ATC).
    2.3. Control of Ground Traffic in the Controlled Movement Area (CMA).
       2.3.1. The CMA consists of the runway and any surface within 150 feet of the runway
       edge. Additionally, the first 1,500 feet of Taxiway Alpha from Runway 08 becomes a
       CMA when the ceiling is 800 feet or less, and/or the visibility is 2 miles or less, and
       Airfield Management will respond IAW para 1.24.1.1. This extra precaution is necessary
       to ensure the instrument landing system (ILS) glideslope critical area is not penetrated
       due to inability to identify precautionary markings during aircraft arrival operations. This
       additional CMA provides protection for the ILS glide slope critical area when
       ceiling/visibility values are below required minimums (see Attachment 2).
       2.3.2. When the Terminal Radar Approach Control in Cab (TRACAB) is open, entry to
       the CMA is gained by contacting Thule Ground on the Tower Net. Vehicles must
       maintain visual contact with the tower and remain alert to light gun signals. When the
       TRACAB is closed, entry to the CMA is gained by contacting GC/Airfield Management
       Operations (AMOPS) on the Ramp net during airfield opening hours and GC/Service
       Call net during all other times. Direct two-way radio communication via these FM Nets
       must be maintained until out of the CMA. English shall be the only language used on the
       Tower Net.
          2.3.2.1. Vehicles without a radio are required to have an escort with two-way radio
          communication with the tower while on the airfield. The escort vehicle is responsible
          to gain CMA entry approval before any vehicle enters the CMA, must remain with
          the escorted vehicle(s) until exit and shall not report out of the CMA until all vehicles
          have exited. The escort vehicle shall use his approved call sign and then indicate the
          number of vehicles being escorted; for example: If Chief2 was escorting six vehicles
          to the fire training area, transmit: “GROUND, CHIEF2 PLUS SIX, REQUEST TO
          CROSS RUNWAY 26 AT TAXIWAY BRAVO.”
          2.3.2.2. Communication-out procedures. In the event that communication with
          vehicle traffic on the airfield is lost, the TRACAB will immediately recall all vehicles
          from the CMA using the following methods.
              2.3.2.2.1. Ground may use light gun signals to control ground traffic in the CMA.
              2.3.2.2.2. All vehicles in the CMA, except for vehicles under escort, are required
              to display AFVA 11-240 (Figure 1).
THULEABI13-204 27 AUGUST 2014                                                                 5


Figure 1. Light Gun Signals




      2.3.3. Procedures for Recalling Personnel from the CMA:
          2.3.3.1. When directed by the tower to exit the CMA, personnel will immediately
          exit via the closest available taxiway and remain at least 150’ from the runway.
          2.3.3.2. In the event it becomes necessary to recall personnel from the CMA and
          radio contact cannot be established, ATC shall use the following methods to re-
          establish contact:
             2.3.3.2.1. Use the appropriate light gun signals (Figure 1).
             2.3.3.2.2. Cycle the runway lights alternately from the highest intensity to the
             lowest, repeating as necessary, until all personnel and equipment are removed
             from the CMA.
             2.3.3.2.3. As a last resort contact AMOPS and request a radio-equipped vehicle
             be dispatched to establish contact.
      2.3.4. When airfield construction exists, GC/AMO will coordinate with the AOF/CC to
      establish a “free zone” so that construction teams can travel into a designated portion of
      the CMA without requesting permission from ATC. GC/AMO will coordinate with
      TRACAB and all applicable agencies if a “free zone” is needed. All “free zones” will be
      established and coordinated IAW the Thule AB Integrated Defense Plan.
      2.3.5. Movement Area. The movement area includes the runway and overruns,
      Taxiways Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie and all aircraft parking areas. Any vehicle operating
      on the movement area must obtain airfield drivers training and possess a valid AF IMT
      483, Certificate of Competency.
   2.4. Airfield Lighting Systems. During the period of 15 Sep - 14 May, airfield lighting
   shall be operated continuously to prevent freezing (dates may be adjusted due to weather
   conditions by GC/AMO).
          2.4.1.1. High Intensity Runway Lights (HIRL).
          2.4.1.2. Distance Remaining Markers.

           2.4.1.3. Threshold Lights and Runway End Lights.
           2.4.1.4. Standard High Intensity Approach Lighting System and Sequenced Flashing
           Lights (ALSF-1). The ALSF-1 is available for Runway 08 only.
           2.4.1.5. Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) Lights. PAPIs are installed for
           Runway08 only.
           2.4.1.6. Taxiway Edge Lights.
           2.4.1.7. Rotating Beacon. Due to after-hours Air Greenland helicopter operations,
           the rotating beacon operates 24 hours a day on top of South Mountain.
       2.4.2. When TRACAB is closed, airfield lighting shall be operated IAW the following
       procedures:
           2.4.2.1. Airfield lighting personnel shall be responsible for operating airfield lighting
           from the vault.
           2.4.2.2. When airfield lighting personnel are not on the airfield, airfield lighting
           control at the vault shall be in the "TRACAB" position.
       2.4.3. GC/AMO shall perform a check of all airfield lighting systems 30 minutes prior to
       airfield opening.
       2.4.4. When notified of an airfield lighting outage, GC/AMO or AMOPS shall notify the
       TRACAB and Airfield Operations Flight Commander (AOF/CC) of the outage,
       coordinate with Service Call to repair the effected system, and issue a Notice to Airman
       (NOTAM).
    2.5. Permanently Closed/Unusable Portions of the Airfield. Taxiway Delta (the first
    1,000’ is available for aircraft use when hazardous cargo is on the aircraft), all other
    pavement south of Runway 08, Strategic Air Command Ramp, Cluster Pits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6
    and parking spots 1-4 are closed to aircraft operations.
    2.6. Aircraft Arresting Systems. None available.
    2.7. Parking Plan/Restrictions. AMOPS will establish transient aircraft parking. Note.
    GC/AMO and AOF/CC have final approval over parked aircraft.
       2.7.1. Summer Season (15 May – 14 Sep). Aircraft will not park inside hangars due to
       weakening caused by ice/permafrost melt.
       2.7.2. Winter Season (15 Sep – 14 May). Aircraft will be authorized use of Hangar 7 and
       8 in the priority order, according to Table 1:
THULEABI13-204 27 AUGUST 2014                                                                   7

5 All other aircraft to include foreign governments
Note: Due to possible structural damage to hangars and aircraft, the hangar doors will remain
closed when winds exceed 30 knots.

   2.8. Air Traffic Control Facilities: Operating Hours and Designated Airspace
      2.8.1. Published operating hours (controlled airfield) are 0800L – 1600L Monday
      through Friday. Closed any other time including Saturday, Sunday, and all U.S. federal
      holidays. On duty TRACAB personnel will be in the facility 30 minutes prior published
      opening hours.
          2.8.1.1. Outside of published hours, TRACAB personnel shall open the facility 30
          minutes prior to all departures and 60 minutes prior to all arrivals. TRACAB shall
          close 15 minutes after the last departure aircraft has exited Thule airspace or the last
          arrival aircraft is parked with engines shut down, whichever is later. During standby
          operations personnel must be able to return facilities to operations within 45 minutes
          of being notified.
      2.8.2. Air Traffic Control On-Call Procedures:
          2.8.2.1. AOF/CC or TRACAB Complex Chief Controller (CCC) will assign on-call
          status to provide service to operations that occur outside normal TRACAB hours of
          operation instead of staffing the facility continuously.
          2.8.2.2. Controllers assigned on-call/standby status must meet/maintain all medical
          requirements in accordance with AFI 13-204v3, until released by the AOF/CC or
          CCC.
      2.8.3. Organizations forecasting operational requirements for services outside published
      airfield operating hours must submit their request to AOF/CC at least three days prior to
      the requested date of service. AOF/CC determines manning availability and validity of
      the request.
      2.8.4. Thule airspace, as defined in paragraph 2.1 of this publication, becomes
      uncontrolled whenever the TRACAB is closed and is not authorized for aircraft
      operations, unless a waiver is granted.
      2.8.5. A minimum of four (4) qualified controllers will be available for duty on Thule
      AB at all times. Manning may be reduced to a minimum of three (3) qualified controllers
      available for duty during emergency leave situations, with approval from the SPTS/CC
      and AFSPC/A3SR notification.

  the TRACAB and appropriate agencies.
     2.17.1. Normal RSC is reported as either dry, wet or “slush on runway.”
     2.17.2. When the runway is reported wet, use caution and expect a RCR 18 or less due to
     painted surface. Use Caution: High potential for hydroplaning exists. Note: Wet = A
     RSC where visible water is the only form of moisture on the runway surface.
     2.17.3. When slush is on the runway without snow or ice then the RSC will be reported
     as “slush on runway” (Do not report an RCR). When water or slush is present on an ice
     covered runway, report the predominant RSC and determine the RCR or use the value 12,
     whichever is lower.
     2.17.4. When ice or snow is present RCR's values will be established in accordance with
     the following chart:

           FALCON, etc.) require scheduled ATC support. When the TRACAB is open for
           limited hours to accommodate special operations, the PCAS will be checked as part
           of the opening checklist.
       6.1.2. Secondary Crash Net (SCN). The SCN originates in AMOPS and is activated
       whenever the PCAS is activated, an airfield emergency is reported by alternate means, or
       when notified that an emergency has been terminated.
           6.1.2.1. The SCN is connected to the stations listed in table 7:

        6.1.2.2. The SCN shall be activated for the daily check within 30 minutes of the
        PCAS daily check, or as soon as practical thereafter.
        6.1.2.3. BDOC is the alternate activator of the SCN. They shall activate it only when
        requested by AMOPS, TRACAB, 821 ABG/CC, or AOF/CC. In addition to daily
        testing conducted by AMOPS, BDOC shall test the net on the first Tuesday of each
        month at 0830 local or as soon as practical thereafter. Results of the check shall be
        forwarded to AMOPS.
  6.2. Emergency Response Procedures.
     6.2.1. Aircraft emergencies shall be handled in accordance with FAAO JO 7110.65 and
     locally developed checklists.
     6.2.2. At a minimum, GC/AMO and Fire Department shall respond to emergencies. The
     Senior Fire Official is the Incident Commander (IC). Other agencies respond as required
     by the IC or AOF/CC.
     6.2.3. If the emergency aircraft Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) is verified to be greater
     than 30 minutes, all response units shall remain at their duty stations and wait for further
     information.
        6.2.3.1. TRACAB shall reactivate the PCAS when the aircraft ETA is 15 minutes.
        At the time of the second call, agencies shall dispatch appropriate personnel and
        equipment to their assembly points.
     6.2.4. AOF/CC shall contact the GC/AMO and the Alarm Center as necessary for recall
     of required personnel, and instruct AMOPS to activate the secondary crash net, if
     required.
     6.2.5. The IC shall advise TRACAB when an emergency on the airfield has been
     terminated.
        6.2.5.1. TRACAB shall relay emergency termination time to AMOPS.
     6.2.6. Ground Handling of Aircraft and Vehicles During Emergencies. The IC does not
     have UHF/VHF dial-up capability; therefore Ground Control must relay all
     communications between the IC and pilot.
        6.2.6.1. Handling of Aircraft.
            6.2.6.1.1. Aircraft that declare an in-flight emergency cannot terminate the
            emergency on their own, once on the ground. All emergencies will be evaluated
            and terminated by the IC.
            6.2.6.1.2. TRACAB will direct aircraft experiencing an emergency with a
            specific handling location (hot brakes, hazardous cargo, etc) to the appropriate
            spot on the airfield. Note: Moving an aircraft with suspected or confirmed hot
            brakes can make the condition worse. Any aircraft with suspected or confirmed
            hot brakes that desires to hold position shall be permitted to do so.
        6.2.6.2. Handling of Vehicles.
            6.2.6.2.1. Ground Control shall broadcast an alert on all frequencies, including
            FM nets that an emergency is in progress and the ETA for in-flight emergencies.
18                                                     THULEABI13-204 27 AUGUST 2014


             An additional broadcast shall be made when the emergency aircraft is next to
             land.
             6.2.6.2.2. Responding vehicles must have ATC approval to enter or cross the
             runway. Normally the IC will be the only fire department vehicle communicating
             with Ground Control and will use the escort procedures described in paragraph
             1.3.2.1.2. of this publication.
             6.2.6.2.3. All vehicles and personnel not involved in the emergency response
             must give way to emergency vehicles and withdraw from the emergency area.
             6.2.6.2.3.1. Any required cordons must be initiated by the IC and relayed to
             Ground Control.
             6.2.6.2.4. If possible, emergency response vehicles should not block other aircraft
             in the vicinity of the emergency.
  6.3. External Stores Jettison Area Procedures. The jettison area is located on the THT
  264T radial between 20 and 30 DME, 5 NM either side of the radial. All aircraft will contact
  ATC for directions and coordinate pilot’s intentions after external stores jettison.
  6.4. Fuel Dumping. The fuel dumping location is between the THT 264T and 274T radials
  between 40 and 50 DME, between FL 180 and FL 190. All aircraft will contact ATC for
  directions and coordinate pilot’s intentions after fuel dumping.
  6.5. Hot Brake Area and Procedures.
     6.5.1. Landing Runway 08. Turn left at end of runway onto Taxiway Alpha and hold as
     instructed.
     6.5.2. Landing Runway 26. Turn right at end of runway onto Taxiway Alpha and hold as
     instructed.
     6.5.3. Pilots suspecting hot brakes shall notify TRACAB. TRACAB shall direct the pilot
     to the nearest hot brake area and activate the PCAS.
     6.5.4. If TA discovers hot brakes after the aircraft has been parked, the aircraft will shut
     down, evacuate the area, and TRACAB shall be notified. TRACAB shall activate the
     PCAS.
     6.5.5. The Fire Department or TA shall determine if hot brakes exist.             The Fire
     Department shall remain at the aircraft until the emergency is terminated.
         6.5.5.1. Any required cordons must be initiated by the IC and relayed to Ground
         Control.
     6.5.6. If hot brakes are not detected the Fire Department or TA shall notify the
     TRACAB. Once the IC terminates the emergency, TA will lead the aircraft to its parking
     area.
  6.6. Abandonment of Aircraft. The bail-out area is overhead Thule AB. If possible ATC
  shall request the number of people on board the aircraft. The pilot shall set the aircraft
  heading east and trimmed to crash over the ice cap.
THULEABI13-204 27 AUGUST 2014                                                                 19


     6.6.1. Approach Control shall monitor the aircraft on radar and obtain a fix on the
     approximate crash area. A good bearing and distance from the ASR should be attainable
     using the cursor and strobe on the radar display. If possible convert this location to crash
     grid coordinates.
     6.6.2. Local Control shall immediately activate the PCAS to announce a bailout. Relay
     the number of people on board if known. Local Control must then make every attempt to
     visually locate parachutes and see where they land. Direct the emergency response to
     those sites via the FM Nets.
  6.7. Crash Locator Beacon Signal/Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) Response
  Procedures.
     6.7.1. Søndrestrøm FIC is responsible for initiating all search and rescue efforts in
     Greenland.
     6.7.2. Testing of emergency beacons is restricted to three audio sweeps within the first 5
     minutes of each hour. If testing is required at times other than during the first 5 minutes
     of each hour, AMOPS and ATC must be notified prior to, and upon completion of, the
     testing.
     6.7.3. When receiving an emergency ELT signal outside the authorized test period,
     TRACAB shall:
         6.7.3.1. Notify AMOPS, Søndrestrøm FIC, and Reykjavik OACC advising them of
         the ELT frequency (121.5, 243.0, or both) involved.
         6.7.3.2. Make appropriate notifications when the source of the signal is located or the
         signal terminates. Note: Unless another indication of an aircraft emergency or
         accident has been received, an ELT signal shall not require the activation of the
         PCAS.
  6.8. Hung Ordnance Procedures. Aircraft landing with hung ordnance shall rollout to the
  end of the landing runway and keep the nose pointed runway heading until the ordnance can
  be pinned and/or returned to a safe condition, as determined by the on-scene commander.
  6.9. Wind Limitations on Control Tower and ASR antenna.
     6.9.1. The structural limitation of the control tower has been determined as 165kts. The
     windowpanes have not been evaluated for strength. Therefore, the tower will be
     evacuated when the sustained wind velocity reaches 60 knots or gusts reach 80 knots,
     similar to procedures at other Air Force control towers worldwide.
     6.9.2. ASR Operation in High Wind.           The antenna will be powered off, or
     “freewheeled”, when closing the facility and whenever sustained or gusting winds reach
     50 knots. The antenna may also be “freewheeled” at WS/SC discretion for forecasted
     winds.
         6.9.2.1. In an emergency situation the antenna may continue to operate outside of the
         “freewheel” wind limits. The WS/SC will advise the CCC or AOF/CC, and
         Communications Management Office (NCMO) whenever this occurs.
         6.9.2.2. Winds to determine the “freewheel” of the ASR antenna will be taken from
         the antenna alarm wind indicator.

             time the movement shall resume. TRACAB shall take the appropriate action
             based upon the length of delay anticipated.
      8.9.3. Transient aircraft to be loaded, unloaded, or serviced with hazardous cargo on
      board shall be parked at a location as determined by GC/AMO or AOF/CC.
      8.9.4. The owner of the hazardous material shall ensure the appropriate placards are
      displayed.
      8.9.5. Priorities. Explosive movements shall be scheduled so as not to conflict with
      handling of Air Mobility Command (AMC) aircraft. However, once in progress, all
      explosive movements shall be given PRIORITY over routine aircraft and vehicular
      traffic.
THULEABI13-204 27 AUGUST 2014                                                                 25


     8.9.6. Any agency desiring to move explosives, from or to the airfield, shall coordinate
     with AOF/CC, 821 ABG/SE, 821 SFS, and AMOPS at least 24 hours in advance.
     Provide the following information: estimated start time, class, quantity, line number,
     origin, name of crew leader, destination, and route. A properly placarded vehicle and
     certified handler are required to transport explosives
  8.10. Night Vision Device (NVD) Operations. Thule AB is not an airfield with reduced
  lighting configurations and therefore does not meet the criteria established in AFI 13-204v3
  for NVD use in terminal airspace.
  8.11. Local Aircraft Priorities. Tower will provide priority ATC service to aircraft in
  accordance with FAAO JO 7110.65 and the following local priorities.
     8.11.1. Aircraft carrying Distinguished Visitors, Code 7 or above, as defined in the DoD
     Flight Information Publication General Planning guide.
     8.11.2. Thule contracted support aircraft (Air Transport International and Air
     Greenland).
     8.11.3. Transient aircraft nonessential missions.
  8.12. Lost Communications Instructions. IAW published ILS approach plates, “In the
  advent of loss communication upon reaching 9000 aircraft are to proceed to HUXEL via own
  navigation, after 1 turn in holding execute the ILS approach.”
  8.13. Standard Climb-Out Instructions. There are no local climb out instructions at
  Thule. Any aircraft not making a full stop landing shall execute the published missed
  approach until reaching the MVA.
  8.14. Opposite Direction Take-Offs and Landings. Opposite direction procedures apply
  to all aircraft regardless whether or not the aircraft is operating VFR or IFR. All verbal
  coordination      will     include    the    phraseology      “OPPOSITE      DIRECTION
  ARRIVAL/DEPARTURE, RWY 08/26”.
     8.14.1. Arrival versus arrival. TRACAB shall not allow an arriving aircraft to proceed
     closer than 15 mile final until a proceeding opposite direction arrival has landed or turned
     to avert on the missed approach.
     8.14.2. Arrival versus departure. TRACAB shall not allow an arriving aircraft to proceed
     closer than 15 mile final until a proceeding opposite direction departure has crossed the
     departure end, and is established on a course diverging by at least 45 degrees from the
     reciprocal of the final approach course.
  8.15. Breakout/Go Around/Missed Approach Procedures. There are no break out/go-
  around procedures at Thule. Any aircraft not making a full stop landing shall execute the
  published missed approach until reaching the MVA.
  8.16. Civilian Aircraft Operations. AFI 10-1001, Civil Aircraft Landing Permits, governs
  civil aircraft landings. The 821 ABG/CC is the approval authority for civil aircraft landings
  for aircraft that meet the requirements in AFI 10-1001.
  8.17. Civil Use of Military Navigational Aids (ATCALS). Unless Emergency Security
  Control of Air Traffic (ESCAT) is initiated, all Thule ATCALS are available for civil use as
  an aid to navigation. Practice approaches are not authorized.
26                                                     THULEABI13-204 27 AUGUST 2014


  8.18. Weather Dissemination and Coordination Procedures. Upon notification from
  weather forecasters, ATC shall broadcast all on and off base hazardous weather warnings to
  all aircraft under their control.
  8.19. Airfield Snow Removal Operations.
     8.19.1. Program Overview: CDRL CEO-7, Snow & Ice Control/Removal Plan,
     establishes procedures and responsibilities for continuing airfield operations after severe
     arctic weather.
     8.19.2. During snow removal operations at least one snow removal vehicle (normally
     Snow Bird4) shall be in radio contact with ATC on the Tower Net and is responsible for
     all snow removal vehicles operating on or near the runway.
     8.19.3. ATC’s authorization for the controlling snow removal vehicle to enter the
     runway is also authorization for the controlling vehicle to bring other snow removal
     vehicles on and off the runway as needed. When instructed to depart the runway, the
     controlling vehicle shall be responsible for ensuring that all snow removal vehicles are
     off the runway. The controlling vehicle shall report off the runway, and state “ALL snow
     removal vehicles are off the runway.” Note: If vehicles are entering the runway for
     reasons other than snow removal (i.e., crossing the runway to transport equipment), the
     lead vehicle in contact with the TRACAB must request permission for his vehicle and the
     additional vehicles that will follow; for example: If Mach 4 was escorting two vehicles
     across, transmit: “GROUND, MACH 4 PLUS 2, REQUEST TO CROSS RUNWAY 26
     AT TAXIWAY BRAVO.”
  8.20. Bird/Wildlife Control.
     8.20.1. Program Overview: 821 ABG Plan 91-212, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard
     (BASH), establishes procedures and responsibilities for minimizing potential wildlife
     hazards to aircraft operating on and around the airfield.
     8.20.2. Program Oversight. 821 ABG/SE is the OPR for the BASH Program, and as such
     shall work closely with AOF/CC and GC/AMO on all BASH matters that pertain to the
     airfield. Management of the BASH Program is conducted via the Bird Hazard Working
     Group (BHWG) which meets in conjunction with the AOB.
     8.20.3. Anyone working on the airfield that observes bird/wildlife activity in the vicinity
     of the airfield shall immediately notify AMOPS at ext 2717.
  8.21. Bird Watch Conditions (BWC). In many situations, aircrew awareness that
  increased bird activity exists will be sufficient action. However, some situations will require
  positive actions to reduce the potential for bird strike such as delaying takeoff or landing.
  Aircrews will determine their own course of action after considering the recommendations of
  821 ABG/SE and GC/AMO.
     8.21.1. Thule BWCs are defined in 821 ABG Plan 91-212. GC/AMO is the final
     authority for changing BWCs.
     8.21.2. ATC will inform all aircraft of observed and/or reported bird/wildlife activity.
     8.21.3. ATC will inform AMOPS of any suspected or confirmed bird strikes.
THULEABI13-204 27 AUGUST 2014                                                                  27


  8.22. Airfield Photography. The 821 ABG/CC has delegated photography permissions to
  the 821 SPTS/CC, AOF/CC or GC/AMO with the exception of PL-1 resources.
  8.23. Wind Cone Requirements. Wind Cones are not available or required at Thule AB,
  due to the required maintenance, replacement expenses, low traffic volume and the fact that
  practice/multiple approaches are not authorized at Thule AB. Air Traffic Control provides
  the wind direction and velocity to landing and departing aircraft. Winds can reach excessive
  velocity and coupled with the extreme temperatures wind cones become easily damaged,
  which could lead to false readings. Aircraft should use extreme caution during critical
  phases of flight when high winds are issued by air traffic control or forecasted by weather.
  8.24. Drinks, Smoking and Smokeless Tobacco Use. Drinks may be consumed inside
  vehicles, but the empty containers must be disposed of properly. Soda cans are prohibited
  outside of the vehicles on the airfield. Glass bottles are prohibited on the airfield, with the
  exception of sample kits. Smoking and the use of smokeless tobacco on the airfield is
  prohibited, including inside vehicles. Tobacco is only to be used in designated tobacco use
  areas.
  8.25. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Prevention.
     8.25.1. Wear of Hats and Restricted Area Badges. Personnel will not wear hats on the
     airfield, except as noted. Wear of the winter watch cap is authorized and may be worn
     during aircraft operations, when using the following procedures: Ear
     defender/communication headsets devices can be worn over the watch cap or a jacket
     hood will be used over the watch cap. The watch cap must be firmly set on individual’s
     head, ensured by pulling watch cap down over the ears, to prevent it from inadvertently
     coming off, and posing a FOD hazard. The wear of a ball cap style hat during daylight
     operations is authorized when it is secured with a lanyard to prevent a FOD hazard.
     Restricted area badges and passes will be secured with a lanyard or arm band with
     protective cover. Note: When conducting official protocol duties on the airfield, the
     senior officer present, or his/her representative, will consider risk factors including
     weather and proximity to operating aircraft engines, and dictate if hats are to be worn for
     a particular occasion (this does not include baggage and aircraft support personnel). No
     individual wearing a hat, regardless of position or rank, will pass within 25 feet of an
     operating engine.
     8.25.2. Organizations with personnel operating on the airfield must ensure newly
     assigned personnel receive a FOD prevention orientation/familiarization briefing prior to
     beginning work on the airfield. The newcomers’ FOD briefing will be documented by
     the responsible organization.
     8.25.3. Personnel operating on the airfield will take an active part in the daily policing of
     the airfield for foreign objects to reduce the potential of damage to aircraft. Facilities
     adjacent to aircraft parking ramps, taxiways, or engine run areas, as well as any shops or
     hangars used for aircraft/component maintenance, will be policed by the owning
     organization. Particular attention to securing dumpster lids during high winds must be
     addressed by each facility manager.
     8.25.4. Personnel will be constantly alert for any form of FOD during all phases of a job.
     Special attention must be given to small items of debris, such as safety wire, bolts, nuts,
28                                                    THULEABI13-204 27 AUGUST 2014


     screws, etc. Loose materials of this kind will be placed in FO containers during the
     normal course of job performance. After the job is complete, a final check of the entire
     work area will be conducted and all foreign objects removed.
     8.25.5. Aircraft/weapons safety pins will not be placed on or left unsecured on aircraft
     parking ramps/movement areas at any time. At no time will aircraft forms be left
     unsecured on the ramp or any external area of the aircraft.
  8.26. Tools on the Airfield. Personnel will not use or possess personal tools in any aircraft
  maintenance area or on the airfield. Personnel will follow guidance established in AFI 21-
  101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, for the Tool Control program. All
  questions or concerns regarding tool use on the airfield will be directed to the Airfield
  Manager or Airfield Operations Flight commander.
