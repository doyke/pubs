This instruction implements AFPD 36-8, Employee Benefits and Entitlements and Work/Life
Programs, 10 February 2009, and AFI 36-807, Weekly and Daily Scheduling of Work and
Holiday Observances, 21 June 1999. This instruction provides guidance and procedures for
supervisors and civilian employees needed to participate in the alternate work schedule (AWS)
program. This instruction applies to all AFRS civilian personnel; however, division chiefs,
branch chiefs, division deputies, and superintendents are excluded from participation in
compressed work schedules. Section chief participation is at the determination of the respective
division and branch chiefs. Ensure all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this
publication are maintained according to AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed
of according to the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule available at
https://www/my.af.mil/gcss-af61/afrims.afrims. A glossary of references and supporting
information used in this instruction is at Attachment 1.

1. Purpose. The purpose of this instruction is to implement AWS options to include
compressed work schedules (CWS) or flexible work schedules (FWS).
2. Core Hours. Core hours are 0730 to 1100 and 1300 to 1630, Monday through Friday. Lunch
period observances are between 1100 and 1300, Monday through Friday.
3. Responsibilities. Commanders and division chiefs reserve the right to:
   3.1. Determine participation within their unit based on mission requirements, customer
   support, and individual work load. Consideration of positions that are minimally manned
   where employees interact with customers outside the organization should be evaluated to
   determine any adverse impact on the division or squadron.

    3.2. Set up or change any work schedule to: (Note: Prior to making work schedule changes,
    contact AFRS Civilian Personnel Management Office, if request is not initiated by
    employee.)
       3.2.1. Ensure adequate employee coverage to meet the operational demands of mission
       requirements.
       3.2.2. Provide adequate customer support.
       3.2.3. Accommodate individual workloads.
       3.2.4. Address the work schedule of an employee covered by an AWS (CWS or FWS)
       program while on temporary duty to a duty station using another schedule--either
       traditional or AWS. Management may allow the employee to continue using his or her
       permanent duty station schedule (if suitable) or require the employee to conform to the
       operations schedule at the temporary duty station.
    3.3. Temporarily suspend compressed or flexible work schedules to meet peak or unusual
    mission demands.
    3.4. Limit participation for new employees requiring close supervision, members scheduled
    for formal training, employees with documented performance or attendance deficiencies, and
    employees with documented misconduct who would require close supervision.
    3.5. Modify or terminate the AWS program (CWS and/or FWS) for individuals or groups of
    employees at any time, without any further negotiations.
4. Tours of Duty and/or Program Parameters for the Alternate Work Schedule Program:
    4.1. CWSs are fixed schedules. Individuals participating in the compressed duty program
    have no provisions for flexibility in reporting or quitting times. Employees will work their
    assigned schedule each day. Lunch periods will be between 1100 and 1300 for the
    established timeframes as addressed in paragraph 4.1.2. Lunch periods in excess of the stated
    timeframe in the option approved will be charged annual leave. Exception: Attendance at
    official functions (for example professional association luncheons, farewell or retirement
    luncheons) approved by the immediate supervisor in advance of the event.
       4.1.1. Tour of duty for employees authorized and voluntarily participating in the CWS
       program is listed in Table 1, as approved by the supervisor.
