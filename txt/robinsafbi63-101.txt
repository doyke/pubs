This publication implements AF Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS)
Mandatory Procedures (MP) 5301.9001(b) and Informational Guidance (IG) for MP
5301.9001(b). This Robins Air Force Base Instruction (RAFBI) establishes processes and
procedures for the implementation of an independent acquisition review process through the use
of a Multi-functional Independent Review Team (MIRT). The MIRT consists of a team of
multi-functional subject matter experts (SMEs) who will assist acquisition teams and the
Clearance Approval Authority (CAA) by validating acquisition strategy and events at the Critical
Decision Points (CDPs) during the acquisition process. The applicable CDPs to be reviewed are
specified in the AFFARS MP 5301.9001(b), paragraph 3.2, and may be found at:
http://farsite.hill.af.mil/reghtml/regs/far2afmcfars/af_afmc/affars/MP5301.9001(b).htm#To
pOfPage. For the purposes of this instruction the CAA is the Director of Contracting, WR-
ALC/PK. This instruction specifically establishes the MIRT’s roles and responsibilities,
membership, process and procedures associated with MIRT activities. This RAFBI applies to all
military and civilian and contractor personnel assigned to or attached to WR-ALC and to all
competitive acquisitions $50M and over (unless the CAA makes a determination to include
competitive acquisitions that are under $50M and/or any non-competitive acquisition). Refer
