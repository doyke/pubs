SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. The major
changes to this instruction will help RWG members facilitate requests and reduce outside unit
coordination for authorizations. The OPR’s office symbol has changed from 51 LRS/LGRX to
51 LRS/LGRDX.
1. General. The RWG was created IAW USFKR 95-5, Armistice Deployments to Republic of
Korea (ROK) Air Bases and Airfields, paragraph 2.1 and 2.2, to coordinate the logistical
requirements of proposed deployments to Osan AB. The 51 FW/CC is the approval authority for
deployments to Osan AB. This authority is delegated down by the 51 FW/CC to the RWG

with the exception of higher headquarters directed deployments.
2. Missions Requiring Coordination. Non ROK units flying aircraft or deploying ground
forces to Osan AB that intend to remain overnight, operate from or make use of Osan AB
facilities must have prior coordination and approval from the RWG chairperson.

     4.2. The 51 LRS/LGRDX flight is identified as the RWG OPR and will act as the facilitator
     for RWG administrative support. Units deploying to Osan AB will use their local Osan AB
     Point of Contact (POC) to coordinate all other requirements to include billeting, subsistence,
     aerospace ground equipment, vehicles, fuel, workspace, and munitions support requirements
     if required.
     4.3. The Airfield Manager (51 OSS/OSAM) is approval authority for all airfield use and will

   medical representative is required to attend NLT 45 days prior to all 7 AF major exercises.
6. Procedures:
   6.1. The RWG meets once a week and 51 LRS/LGRDX will prepare the RWG agenda and
   are also responsible for staffing all formal support requests to include designating tracking
   numbers, recording support decisions and notifying local POCs on status of 51 FW Form 21.
   6.2. Meeting minutes will be sent by the RWG Coordinator to each RWG member and local
   POC.
   6.3. All 51 FW Form 21 will be filled out by requesting unit POC and provided to 51
   LRS/LGRDX NLT 60 days prior to proposed deployment (IAW USFKR 95-5, para. 3-3).
   All applicable information must be filled out by the requesting unit POC and incomplete
   requests will be returned to unit with no action taken until complete request is returned to 51
   LRS/LGRDX. This request will contain, as a minimum, the following information:
      6.3.1. Deploying unit identification.
      6.3.2. Purpose of the deployment. Include the identification of the units being supported.
      6.3.3. Requested deployment dates, to include prepositioning and departure.
      6.3.4. Requested deployment base and alternates if the preferred base is not available.
      6.3.5. Number and type of aircraft. Provide estimate if information is not finalized.
      6.3.6. Range, drop zone, landing zone, and/or space zone requirements, takeoff times,
      times over target, and recovery times. Identify additional operating ABs (other than the
      bed down base) if required.
      6.3.7. Special needs or considerations associated with the unit or aircraft.
      NOTE: Deployment requests received between 30 days and 60 days before the requested
      deployment date may not allow sufficient time to coordinate the required support and
4                                                        51FWI10-402 21 NOVEMBER 2012


       services. If requests are received later than 30 days before the deployment date, they may
       be disapproved with little prior notice to the requestor because they do not meet ROK Air
       Force requirements.
    6.4. All units deploying to Osan AB will identify a local POC who must attend the RWG
    weekly meeting in order to represent unit’s request. If the local POC does not attend, the
    request will be placed on hold until the POC can attend.
       6.4.1. The local POC will coordinate with 51 LRS/LGRDX and applicable RWG POCs
       for all requested support and RWG number. Prior to arrival, incoming units should not
       contact supplier directly but use their Osan POC for all questions involving support from
       supporting units. To obtain Prior Permission Required (PPR) from 51 OSS/OSAM, unit
       must reference the approved RWG number.
       6.4.2. All Osan AB POCs must ensure all incoming units complete the flight line driver’s
       training/orientation, if required, prior to operating a vehicle on the flight line.
    6.5. All fighter/fighter type aircraft requests will be coordinated through the RWG prior to
    being presented to the 51 OG/CC or designated representative.
