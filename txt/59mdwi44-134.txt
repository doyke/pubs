SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major
changes include change of physician responsibilities and the deletion of inpatient requirements.
1. General.
   1.1. A dangerous patient is defined as a person who threatens to injure self or others, or to
   destroy property.
 2                                                          59MDWI44-134 21 JANUARY 2014


     1.2. Suicidal thoughts, plans, or behavior indicate suicidal risk. Patients at risk for suicide
     may or may not verbalize suicidal ideation.
2. Procedures.
     2.1. Minimize Risk. Use the least restrictive measures necessary to maintain staff and
     patient safety.
        2.1.1. Dangerous patients are to remain under constant direct observation at all times,
        including when using the restroom.
        2.1.2. Use a private room designated for dangerous patients that is free of dangerous or
        sharp objects, medications, or any other items that could be used to injure self, others or
        destroy property.
        2.1.3. If necessary, the individual clinic/nursing unit can organize and utilize a response
        team for a show of force to encourage the patient to refrain from threatening or physically
        assaulting others.
        2.1.4. Unrestrained, Violent Patients. Protection of staff is paramount. Do not attempt
        intervention without adequate assistance. If the patient is out of control and you
        intervene, protect yourself. For example, if you are in the same room as the patient, you
        may exit the room until adequate staff is available for support.
            2.1.4.1. Allow patient to maintain distance between him/herself and staff.
            2.1.4.2. Allow patient to express his/her thoughts and feelings.

            Codes and Alarms, as appropriate. Calling Hospital Automated Resource Protection
            Systems (HARPS) can also initiate a Security Forces response.
            2.1.4.5.1. Within Reid Clinic, initiate Code Green or Code White per 59 MDWI 41-
            125, as appropriate. Call Security Forces at 671-0911 for response.
            2.1.4.6. If patient attempts to leave, allow him/her to do so to prevent harm to you,
            others, or to himself/herself. Notify hospital security by radio or phone, 292-6070.
            Do not hang up the telephone until HARPS tells you to. Provide HARPS with a
            complete description and identification of the patient and situation, such as: How
            departure was made, direction patient was headed or last seen, what patient was
            wearing, etc.
     2.2. Transport and Disposition Safety.

            transportation to the San Antonio Military Medical Center (SAMMC) Emergency
            Department (ED).

           preferably SAMMC.
       2.2.2. Non-violent, Suicidal Patients Refusing Mental Health Services.
           2.2.2.1. Active Duty. During duty hours (0730-1630), active duty patients, including
           basic trainees, who refuse evaluation or hospitalization, may be referred for an
           Emergency Commander Directed Evaluation by their commander. Commanders
           should contact the appropriate military outpatient Mental Health (MH) clinic to

           SAMMC ED.
           2.2.2.2. Non-active duty (retired, dependent or civilian patients). Patients determined
           to be a danger to themselves or others but refusing hospitalization, comply with
           Section 2.1. of this document and refer to the MH clinic for assessment. If patient
           refuses the MH consult, make arrangements per Bexar County procedures. These
           procedures must be coordinated through the Bexar County Mental Health Office
           (210-335-2536).      Transportation is provided by the Bexar County Sheriff's
           Department. Contact the MLC office if there are any questions or concerns. If
           necessary, law enforcement should be contacted as well
              2.2.2.2.1. Uncooperative, non-active duty patients (retired, dependent, or civilian
              patients) who are determined not to be a danger to self or to others will not be
              detained or hospitalized if they refuse evaluation.
       2.2.3. Violent, Unrestrained Patients.
           2.2.3.1. HARPS or a staff duty officer during non-duty hours should be consulted for
           medically cleared belligerent patients who refuse to leave.
       2.2.4. Violent, Restrained Patients. Any restrained or handcuffed patients brought to the
       Urgent Care Center (UCC) by law enforcement may be psychotic, suicidal, or homicidal.
       UCC personnel should defer these patients to SAMMC for active duty personnel or to the
       nearest accepting emergency department for civilians.
3. Responsibilities.
   3.1. Non-Mental Health Physician:
       3.1.1. It is recommended that the primary physician or on-call resident contact the
       Mental Health Clinic to evaluate any patient who verbalizes suicidal thoughts, especially
       those whose behavior indicates dangerous or suicidal/homicidal intent. If evaluation by a
       mental health provider is deemed necessary, the patient must be escorted per Section 2.2
       of this instruction. The MH Squadron will have an on-call provider after duty hours for
       telephonic consultations. In most cases, per AFI 44-172, Mental Health, the provider
       will not come to the WHASC for a face-to-face evaluation after duty hours nor will the
       on-call provider talk to the patient over the telephone.

    4.2. As with adult patients, special care will be taken to ensure the least restrictive measures
    will be utilized to maintain staff and patient safety. If available, Child Psychiatry at the MH
    clinic can be contacted for assistance.
       4.2.1. Non-adult patients will not be admitted or transferred to the adult inpatient
       psychiatry ward at SAMMC. Medically stable, non-adult patients will be transferred, if
       necessary, to a civilian inpatient unit appropriate for children. Procedures are the same as
       with adult patients, with the following exceptions:
           4.2.2.1. In Texas, a child may consent to counseling for suicide prevention, chemical
           addiction or dependency, or Sexual, physical, or emotional abuse. Counseling can
           take place with or without parental consent.
           4.2.2.2. Pediatric patients, age 16 or 17, may voluntarily be transferred to an inpatient
           psychiatric hospital without parental consent.

           16 or 17 who are dangerous and non-voluntary for admission cannot be admitted by
           their parents. They require a court order for non-voluntary commitment. Contact the
           MH clinic for assistance.
           4.2.2.4. Pediatric patients aged 15 and below can be transferred and admitted to a
           psychiatric hospital by their parent(s), regardless of child’s desire.
           4.2.2.5. If the parents refuse admission for a dangerous child age 15 years or
           younger, a court ordered commitment might be necessary. See Chapters 571-578 of
           the Texas Health and Safety Code Contact Psychiatry or Medical-Legal for
