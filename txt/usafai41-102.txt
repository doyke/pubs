This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 41-1, Health Care Programs
and Resources, 15 April 1994. It establishes policy for emergency medical standby services,
structure, staffing, management oversight, utilization, functional control, and healthcare
standards for Department of Defense (DoD), United States Air Force (USAF) and/or United
States Air Force Academy (USAFA)-approved events. It sets the standards for the minimum
required staffing, skill level and onsite capabilities based on event risk, forecasted attendance,
environmental and security threat. The scope of this instruction is to minimize injury/illness,
prevent additional injuries/illness, aid in rescue, provide first aid and assess evacuation needs.
This instruction should be used with current editions of the Accreditation Association for
Ambulatory Health Care manual and published standards of Sport Medicine, National Collegiate
Athletic Association (NCAA) Division 1 directives, National Registry of Emergency Medical
Technicians and other national professional organizations as appropriate. This instruction
applies to all active duty Air Force, Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard, USAFA Cadets and
civilian medical components when and where USAFA event activities are performed. The
instruction supports other approved Operational Plans, Operational Orders, Medical Contingency
Response Plan (MCRP), NCAA Division athletic healthcare directives or USAFA Command
Surgeon (USAFA/SG) clinical judgment. This instruction provides a framework for reviewing
and revising Operational Plans and Operational Orders requiring emergency medical standby
support. This instruction is the recommended guidance for all events including Operational
Plans and Operational Orders and should be considered the medical support plan for all
emergency medical standby support. Refer recommended changes and questions about this
publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using Air Force (AF) Form 847,

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction has been renumbered from United States Air Force Academy Instruction
(USAFAI) 41-202 to USAFAI 41-102 to align with the implementing Air Force Policy Directive
(AFPD) and a section for “On Field Physician Coverage for Competing Athletes” was added.
1. Responsibilities. The USAFA/SG is responsible for ensuring appropriate medical support
for all USAFA and 10th Air Base Wing (10 ABW)-sponsored events based on their risk
category. USAFA/SG will review and approve procured medical support purchased or acquired
by Non-Department of Defense (Non-DoD) agencies for events occurring on USAFA with the
exception of those events coordinated by and for the District 20 School System. Support may
come from the 10th Medical Group (10 MDG), Cadet Emergency Medical Technicians (Cadet
EMTs), American Medical Response (AMR) contracted Ambulance Service and/or via contract
from the agency sponsoring the event.
     1.1. USAFA/SG delegates review and approval to the 10th Medical Group Chief of Staff
     (USAFA/SGH) or 10th Medical Group Chief of Aerospace Medicine (USAFA/SGP) in
     his/her absence.
     1.2. USAFA/SG appoints an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) Director and an
     Emergency Response Coordinator (ERC) in writing.
        1.2.1. The EMT Director is responsible for ensuring Cadet EMTs involved in providing
        medical support at USAFA events are trained, certified, and practice within the National
        Registry of Emergency Medical Technician’s scope of practice. The Director will also
        ensure that USAFA event coverage requiring Cadet EMTs has been validated with this
        instruction and approved by the USAFA/SG or designee.
     1.3. USAFA agencies requesting emergency medical standby support for events held on
     base will coordinate directly with the ERC. The ERC will review the request and determine
     the required emergency medical standby coverage based on the risk assessment matrix
     (Figure 1) contained in this instruction with the exception of events sponsored by the District
     20 School System.
     1.4. Non-DoD agencies will be required to procure emergency medical standby support for
     their events in accordance with USAFA/SG event risk assessment (Figure 1) and USAFA/SG
     emergency medical standby support manpower matrix (Figure 2). USAFA/SG reserves the
     right to review license, certifications and contracts of all procured emergency medical
     standby support by Non-DoD agencies holding events on USAFA.
2. Risk-based Emergency Medical Standby Support for Audience/Spectators. All events
must be approved and coordinated by 10 Air Base Wing/Plans/Programs (ABW/XP). Medical
support is based on the risk to the event spectator. Medical support for the athlete is an
independent medical assessment and is addressed in paragraph 3 of this instruction. USAFA/SG
USAFAI41-102 10 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                  3


is the approving authority for medical support for any event on USAFA. USAFA/SG is the final
approving authority to modify the number of medical staff required and type (AFSC) required at
said events.
   2.1. Risk assessment is based on three areas: spectator demeanor, crowd size and event
   environment. Spectator demeanor is the single largest part of the assessment accounting for
   more than 50% of the risk assessment and produces the greatest number of medical calls.
   Overall crowd size with consideration of event durations is displayed in the USAFA/SG
   event risk assessment matrix (Figure 1).       The last determining factor is the event
   environment that encompasses the weather, terrain and altitude. These three areas combined
   will determine the risk assessment as HIGH, MODERATE or LOW. At his/her discretion,
   USAFA/SG may consider historical injury/illness data to determine the risk level of an event.
   2.2. HIGH RISK – High risk spectator event is UNLIKELY on USAFA as it is not usually
   within acceptable USAF standards and/or behavior. EXAMPLES: Events that are alcohol
   centered such as Oktoberfest; protests sponsored by hate groups with the intent to riot;
   activities with extreme sexual overtones or events with a known history of associated drug
   use or causing injuries such as rock concerts with “mosh pits” or motorcycle races.
       2.2.1. If an event is approved and the assessment is of a high risk, the USAFA/SG will
       determine the medical footprint. It is likely that USAFA/SG will require direct assistance
       from other base agencies to assure that medical response can be delivered safely,
       effectively and within acceptable guidelines. EXAMPLE: Armed security teams and
       Fire Rescue units. Upon request from the USAFA/SG, these units would provide
       assistance to the medical response teams and would respond with the medics to every
       medical assistance request.
   2.3. MODERATE RISK – These events are those with large groups (greater than 1,000
   attendees) that are not in a seated venue, or large groups that are exposed to extreme weather
   (greater than 85 degrees or less than 40 degrees) for the duration of the event, seated or non-
   seated. This would include large groups that will require transportation to multiple venues or
   walking more than 2 miles to the next venue site. Also included are large citizen sporting
   events (non-athlete, greater than 1,000 attendees) like 5K/10K runs for charity. Lastly, this
   category includes groups that have approved Distinguished Visitor (DV) status or sensitive
   overtones. EXAMPLES: Some football games held at Falcon Stadium during inclement
   weather, Parents’ Weekend, or other outdoor mass assemblies.
   2.4. LOW RISK – These events have greater than 2,500 attendees that are seated and/or
   indoors. For outdoor seated events, if weather is less than 85 degrees or more than 40
   degrees for the duration of the event it will be considered LOW RISK. Groups (greater than
   2,500 attendees) that are at a single venue and walking less than 2 miles would also be LOW
   RISK. EXAMPLES: Family concerts or indoor sporting events, unit events under command
   and control of a squadron commander or military conferences and/or educational gatherings.
   This category would include most football games based on projected attendance and weather.

3. Risk-based Emergency Medical Standby Support for Participating Athletes. The
USAFA Athletic Department (AD) will provide a National Athletic Trainers’ Association
(NATA) Certified Athletic Trainer (CAT) to cover the designated athletic home events. A 10
MDG provider may assist the CAT in athletic event medical coverage upon the request of AD.
     3.1. At the request of AD, USAFA/SG will review the need for on-scene contract ambulance
     coverage for high-risk sports. Beyond ambulance support, the USAFA/SG will not provide
     any additional medical support for USAFA intercollegiate athletes unless specifically
     requested by AD. The sports listed below in paragraph 3.2 have been designated high risk
     based on the NCAA 2005-2006 Sports Medicine Handbook.
         3.1.1. AD will coordinate ambulance support for all High Risk Sports through the 10
         MDG Events Coordinator. Any additional provider support requests for High Risk
         Sports will also be coordinated through the 10 MDG Events Coordinator. For any
         cancellation or changes of events after duty hours AD should contact AMR On-Duty
         supervisor at (719) 636-2333.
         3.1.2. Special Events, such as, but not limited to ABW and CW formations, changes of
         command, graduation, parades, basic cadet training, etcetera, will be applied to the risk
         assessment and support manpower matrices to determine appropriate medical coverage.

5. Emergency Medical Standby Support Requirements Beyond Capability of 10
MDG. Cost of medical support that is directed by USAFA/SG for the health and safety of
spectators that is beyond the 10 MDG’s capabilities is paid by the event sponsor. 10 MDG
support for said events is based on surge or excess capacity and does not override other mission
requirements.
6. Competent Medical Authority. All medical care rendered during events will be assessed by
a competent medical authority. The 10th Aerospace Medicine Squadron (10 AMDS) Cadet
EMT Medical Director will be the competent medical authority for Cadet EMTs. The 10
MDG/SGH or SGP will be the competent medical authority for all others.
     6.1. The USAFA/SG has the right to approve or disapprove all emergency medical standby
     support procured by USAFA agencies when requirements exceed 10 MDG capabilities. The
     USAFA/SG may also disapprove any medical support procured by Non-DoD agencies when
     the support is not deemed adequate or licensure and certification are not current or not
     provided for review.
USAFAI41-102 10 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                  7


7. On Field Physician Coverage for Competing Athletes.
   7.1. On field coverage for NCAA events will be provided by a core of USAFA Team
   Physicians and Training Room staff. This group of medical providers will be dedicated to
   provide care for the competing athletes in accordance with NCAA guidelines. Guidance
   regarding events requiring onsite physician and Athletic Trainer coverage are provided in the
   NCAA Handbook, and NATA statement “Recommendations and Guidelines for Appropriate
   Medical Coverage of Intercollegiate Athletics”.
   7.2. A core of team physicians will be designated and appointed by USAFA/SG with the
   principal responsibility for treating and coordinating the medical care of the intercollegiate
   athletes.
   7.3. Team physicians will be selected in accordance with the Team Physician Consensus
   Statement (AAFP, AAOS, ACSM, AMSSM, AOSSM, AOASM).
      7.3.1. Team Physician Consensus Statement: The principal responsibility of the team
      physician is to provide for the well-being of individual athletes – enabling each to realize
      his/her full potential. The team physician should possess special proficiency in the care
      of musculoskeletal injuries and medical conditions encountered in sports. The team
      physician also must actively integrate medical expertise with other healthcare providers,
      including medical specialists, athletic trainers and allied health professionals. The team
      physician must ultimately assume responsibility within the team structure for making
      medical decisions that affect the athlete’s safe participation.
      7.3.2. Team Physician selection requirements are detailed in the Team Physician
      Consensus Statement and include specifically: Doctor of Medicine (MD) or Doctor of
      Osteopathic Medicine (DO) in good standing with an unrestricted license to practice
      medicine, possess a fundamental knowledge of emergency care regarding sporting
      events, be trained in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), have working knowledge of
      trauma, musculoskeletal injuries and medical conditions affecting the athlete, specialty
      board certification, formal training in sports medicine during orthopedic residency or
      formal fellowship training in sports medicine. Currently this includes orthopedic
      surgeons and Sports Fellowship trained Primary Care providers assigned to the 10 MDG.
   7.4. A Head Team Physician will be selected from the core group of team physicians and
   appointed by USAFA/SG. Selection criteria for Head Team Physician include Fellowship
   training in Sports Medicine and experience as fellowship trained sports medicine provider.
      7.4.1. The Head Team Physician will provide oversight to the core of team physicians as
      well as function as the primary liaison between the AD training room staff and the team
      physicians. He/She will also be responsible for assigning the team physicians
      responsibilities including team responsibilities and event coverage.
