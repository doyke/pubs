DOVERAFBI21-107 18 September 2014                                                            3


     will be in writing for the purpose of financial accountability and coordinated through the
     unit’s Resource Advisor.
     3.3.5. Develop a system of inventory and control.
        3.3.5.1. Units are encouraged to use TCMax or other MAF approved tool control
        software to conduct and document inventories for all tools and equipment. For those
        sections using manual tracking, tools/equipment will contain a Master Inventory List
        (MIL), and a locally developed Missing/Removed Tool Log.
            3.3.5.1.1. MILs will list the complete inventory of the kit and, if applicable,
            location of tool/item. All items attached/fastened to a tool box by lanyard will be
            annotated on the MIL (e.g. locks, FOD pouches, MIL pouches) as a line item with
            the intent of accountability. Toolboxes, trays, shadowing foam and MILs need
            not be annotated on the MIL.
  3.4. CTK Custodians will:
     3.4.1. At a minimum, conduct and document 90-day inventories for all items utilized on
     the airfield or within maintenance facilities (sealed kits are exempt until the seal is
     broken) unless alternate methods for inspection and inventories have been approved in
     writing by the owning Sq CC not to exceed 180 day intervals. Complete inventories will
     be accomplished and documented annually, and when the primary CTK custodian
     changes.
     3.4.2. Ensure all tools are marked and readily identifiable by squadron and shop CTK
     identifiers.
        3.4.2.1. World Wide Identification Designators (WWID) and CTK identifiers are
        developed by owning units and approved for use by 436MXG/QA. Units will use
        only the approved designators in Attachment 2. Designators not approved by QA or
        not listed in Attachment 2 are not authorized.
     3.4.3. Ensure spare and consumable tools are controlled at all times and inventoried to
     prevent fraud, waste, and abuse by locking them in a secure place and keeping them
     separated from issued tools.
     3.4.4. Expendable tools such as apex bits and consumable tools such as safety wire
     spools, along with HAZMAT items, will be accounted for and will be turned in to the
     CTK custodian for proper disposal, with the exception of tooling with self-contained
     oil/hazmats. All CTKs that have HAZMAT materials will have appropriate Safety Data
     Sheets (SDS) available in the workcenter.
     3.4.5. Secure and track all broken tools in a controlled, lockable area, until they are
     processed for disposal. Contents must match the tracking log. Ensure that all etchings
     are completely removed from broken non-repairable tools prior to removing them from
     the CTK for disposal. CTK custodians will document all removed/broken CTK items on
     the MIL and in the applicable tool control software.
     3.4.6. At no time will the same person sign out and sign in their own CTK(s) or
     equipment. NOTE: Self-service electronic tool cabinets that verify accountability of
     each tool do not fall under this requirement. In sections with minimal personnel or a
 4                                                     DOVERAFBI21-107 18 September 2014


        single person on shift, utilize the squadron production superintendent or neighboring
        section supervisor to conduct turn-in inventories.
     3.5. Users will:
        3.5.1. Perform a visual inventory of all tools and equipment when issued for use, at the
        completion of a job or task, and when returned to the tool storage area.
        3.5.2. Ensure only individual equipment items purchased by the unit are used in work
        centers and on the flightline.
        3.5.3. Identify individual equipment Items (e.g., ear defenders, reflective belts, etc.) with
        minimum first initial, last name, and last four of the individuals social security number
        (SSN). The individual’s employee number may be used in lieu of the last four of the
        individual’s SSN.
4. Rags/Absorbent Material Control:
     4.1. Rags will be issued in sets or otherwise be individually accounted for when issued, at
     the completion of each task, before leaving the work site, and at turn-in. Each work center
     will determine their issue size based on usage and workload. Rags will be accounted for at
     the end of each shift by CTK personnel. All rags not accounted for will be treated as a lost
     tool and will be reported. Cheesecloth is considered a rag; however, paper products/paper
     towels are not considered rags. Rags should be uniform in size and color.
     4.2. Absorbent material, once used in the workplace, will be disposed of properly in
     accordance with all applicable regulations, instructions, and standards.
5. Lost Tool Procedures:
     5.1. Report lost or missing tool/equipment items, within the airfield or aircraft maintenance
     facilities to the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC)/Air Transportation Operations Center
     (ATOC) at 677-5436 immediately. Use the Lost Tool Report, Attachment 3. Agencies
     outside of the MXG should immediately contact the Command Post at 677-4201.
     5.2. If a tool/item is lost on, or believed to be lost on an aircraft, notify the Flight Line
     Production Superintendent/Duty Officer and MOC/ATOC immediately. MOC/ATOC will
     notify 436 MXG/QA. Agencies outside of the MXG should immediately contact the
     Command Post. After an initial search of the work area (not to exceed one hour or at the
     discretion of squadron supervision) a Lost Tool Report will be initiated. The MOC/ATOC
     will issue a Red X job control number on the aircraft involved.
     5.3. If an item/tool is discovered missing after an aircraft has blocked, initiate the normal
     lost tool procedures. Notify MOC/Command Post and the appropriate production
     superintendent immediately. MOC will notify the aircraft commander/ next station of
     arrival, as well as 436/512 MXG/CC and Command Post.
     5.4. The person who issued the item/tool will initiate a Lost Tool Report through the affected
     CTK Support Section. All 436 MXG reports will be maintained electronically in the MXG
     Lost Tool Database on the shared drive G:\436AW\436MXG\QualityAssurance\Group Lost
     Tools.
        5.4.1. 436 MXG Lost Tool Reports will be posted to the database no later than the end of
        the effected duty shift to ensure all pertinent information is gathered and reported.
DOVERAFBI21-107 18 September 2014                                                              5


      5.4.2. In the event of a database failure, use the Lost Tool Report as an interim report.
      When utilizing the alternate form, fill in all required information and forward the report
      to MXG/QA (Fax # 5609) and squadron CTK monitor. The squadron CTK monitor will
      input the report into the MXG Lost Tool Database and reference the assigned control
      number once the database is recovered.
   5.5. If an item/tool is lost and no aircraft are involved, notify the Production
   Superintendent/Duty Officer/Command Post or equivalent immediately. After an initial
   search of the immediate work area (not to exceed one hour or at the discretion of squadron
   supervision) a Lost Tool Report will be initiated and forwarded to the 436 MXG/QA office
   within 24 hours.
   5.6. Aircrew will account for all tools and equipment dispatched to the flight line (e.g.,
   flashlights, knives, etc.). If an aircrew member discovers a tool missing and it cannot be
   located after an initial search, the aircrew member will enter a Red X in the AFTO Form
   781A with a description of the tool and a specific last known location, and notify the
   Production Superintendent to enter the item into the MXG Lost Tool Database. Additionally,
   an AMC 97, AMC In-Flight Emergency and Unusual Occurrence Worksheet, will be
   submitted to Flight Safety.
   5.7. If an Aircrew Flight Equipment member discovers a tool missing and it cannot be
   located after an initial search, the person who lost the tool will notify the Production
   Superintendent and Aircrew Flight Equipment supervision immediately.
   5.8. Any time a tool is found, contact the Production Superintendent/Duty Officer or
   equivalent with the type of tool, etching number, and location where the tool was found. 436
   MXG personnel will contact MXQA. QA will update the database status for that item (when
   applicable). The tool can then be returned to the work center or tool room it was issued from.
6. Warranted Tool Program:
   6.1. CTK custodians will manage warranty tools and equipment in the same manner as other
   tools. All tools under warranty will be replaced with another warranted tool using the GPC
   process. CTK custodians will establish controls to ensure damaged/unserviceable tools are
   de-etched, secured and accounted for until processed by the vendor.
7. 436th Maintenance Group:
   7.1. Tool Control: TCMax will be used as the primary means for accountability, tracking
   and control of tools and equipment stored and issued. AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue
   Receipt, may be used in addition to TCMax for increased accountability or as a TCMax
   backup.
   7.2. Only the Pro-Super or Expediter will authorize on-site turnover of tools. When tool kits
   must be exchanged between mechanics at the job site, the inventory shall be accomplished
   prior to turning the kit over to the next person with both parties present. Upon completing
   the inventory, the person being relieved will hand carry the AF IMT 1297 (Temporary Issue
   Receipt) to the CTK monitor to transfer accountability of the tools or equipment in TCMax.
   7.3. 436 MXG/QA will coordinate on all procedures for locally manufactured tools for
   aircraft use not authorized in specific technical data. Procedures are defined in MXGOI 21-
   20, Local Manufacture.
 6                                                     DOVERAFBI21-107 18 September 2014


     7.4. Crash Damaged or Disabled Aircraft Recovery (CDDAR): All CDDAR equipment will
     be stored in Hangar 714, the Aero Repair Shop (Maintenance Squadron). Aero repair
     personnel are responsible for the maintenance and timely inspection of all CDDAR
     equipment and equipment trailers.
        7.4.1. CDDAR trailer/vehicle and items similar to those normally stored in a CTK (i.e.
        tools/test equipment) will be annotated IAW AFI 21-101, AMCSUP I, and will be
        tracked utilizing TCMax or other approved MAF tool control software. Additionally,
        maintenance and inspection actions will be tracked through MIS G081 system, AFTO
        Form 95, and AFTO Form 244, as required. All equipment will be readily accessible and
        kept serviceable at all times.
     7.5. Point of Use (POU) Trailer:
        7.5.1. To provide timely access to composite tool kits, the following policy will be
        implemented to ensure accountability, management and oversight of CTK section Maxi
        Kits and POU trailers on the flight line. Maxi Kits will be permanently located in each
        maintenance POU trailer. Each trailer will maintain separate maxi-kit binders and a
        binder listing for the trailer’s overall contents.
        7.5.2. The owning CTK section is charged with the maintenance and correction of CTK
        discrepancies. The CTK section will also inspect and recertify the POU trailer and Maxi-
        Kits every 30 days. During this inspection, tools will be inspected individually to ensure
        “tool mixing” between kits does not occur. In the event of a lost tool or item, follow
        established procedures.
        7.5.3. The CTK representative will sign out required POU trailer and Maxi-kit toolbox,
        in TCMax, to the individual assuming custodial responsibility. A complete and thorough
        inventory will be conducted at this time by the individual. All discrepancies will be
        identified at this time prior to assuming responsibility of the trailer, Maxi-kit toolbox and
        contents. The Shift Chief or Dock Chief will inform the technician(s) of POU location.
        7.5.4. At shift turnover, a thorough kit inventory will be conducted by the team
        leader/technician of the off-going shift with the designated team leader/technician of the
        oncoming shift.      When all equipment is accounted for, the on-coming team
        leader/technician will sign the kit in for the off-going team leader/technician on the
        Inventory and Control Log book.
8. Other Agencies.
     8.1. Depot teams, factory representatives, contract field teams, and other agencies that work
     on aircraft or unit equipment will follow guidance listed in this instruction. MXG/QA
     representatives will brief the agencies on proper procedures for tool and equipment control
     prior to work starting and will monitor throughout for compliance.
9. Multiple Work Centers and/or Multiple Support .
     9.1. Work centers are limited to a single tool room where tools and tool kits will be issued
     and controlled from a single location in a work center. Non-aircraft maintenance work
     centers without a specific dedicated tool room space will utilize available space as required
     with tool storage and organization designed to facilitate control and accountability
     centralized within existing facility space.
DOVERAFBI21-107 18 September 2014                                                             7


10. Decentralized Locations.
   10.1. Units may wish to store oversized CTKs or equipment outside of a designated tool
   room when size makes it impractical to store within. In these situations, all other
   requirements (e.g., control, use, accountability, etc.) are identical. The CTK custodian must
   ensure all program requirements meet the intent of AFI 21-101 (and applicable MAJCOM
   supplements) and this instruction.
