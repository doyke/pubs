       1.2.3.3. Except when otherwise mandated, designate the training level to which each API 6 crew-
       member will train. Upon request, provide HQ ACC/A3Y with a list of Basic Mission Capable
       (BMC)- and Combat Mission Ready (CMR)-designated staff crewmember positions. Review pro-
       grams and manning position designations annually.
       1.2.3.4. Forward supplements to this volume and other supporting documents to MAJCOM OPRs
       for review and approval. Review supplements each training cycle.
    1.2.4. Squadron (SQ) supervision will:
       1.2.4.1. Ensure adequate continuity and supervision of individual training needs, experience, and
       proficiencies of assigned and attached crewmembers.
AFI11-2RQ-4V1 3 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                         5


     1.2.4.2. Ensure review of training and evaluation records of newly assigned crewmembers and
     those completing formal training to determine the training required for them to achieve BMC or
     CMR and to ensure compliance with provisions of this volume.
     1.2.4.3. Ensure RAP missions are oriented to developing basic combat skills or practicing
     employment that simulates conditions anticipated in the unit mission. Provide guidance to ensure
     logging of only effective RAP missions as RAP sorties. See Attachment 2 for RAP mission defi-
     nitions.

     qualification versus familiarization.
     1.2.4.5. Determine utilization of BMC crewmembers.
     1.2.4.6. Determine how many and which BMC and CMR crewmembers will carry special capa-
     bilities or qualifications.
     1.2.4.7. Identify supervision levels required to accomplish required training, unless specifically
     directed.
     1.2.4.8. Assist the wing and group in developing the unit training programs.
     1.2.4.9. Monitor currencies and requirements for individual assigned and attached crewmembers.
     1.2.4.10. Ensure crewmembers only participate in sorties, events, and tasks in which they have
     adequate preparation, training, and currency.
  1.2.5. ACC squadrons will submit the following training reports:
     1.2.5.1. Four-Month Reports. ACC squadrons will submit a training report to HQ ACC/A3Y
     every four months during the training cycle (due 31 May, 30 Sep, and 31 Jan) covering the periods
     Jan-Apr, May-Aug, and Sep-Dec. Squadrons may submit out-of-cycle reports at anytime if head-
     quarters assistance is required to prepare for Designed Operational Capability (DOC) or Air and
     Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) tasking. The reports will consist of:
         1.2.5.1.1. An email memorandum summarizing results or unresolved issues since the last
         report, current training plan summary, and significant shortfalls and/or limiting factors (LIM-
         FACS) affecting training. Report only significant shortfalls and/or LIMFACS of events or sor-
         ties that affect 15% or greater of the squadron’s crew force. Include possible solutions or
         specific assistance required if able. HQ ACC will attempt to rectify or minimize noted short-
         falls or LIMFACS while the training cycle is under way. Shortfalls occur when required mis-
         sion training tasks are not accomplished due to shortages of equipment, etc. Example:
         squadron’s ability to complete training requirements is limited due to a shortage of sensors.
         LIMFACS are factors, constraints, restrictions, etc. that degrade training effectiveness. LIM-
         FACS may include support hardware and software. Example: squadron’s ability to accomplish
         sensor training events is limited due to the lack of ranges.
         1.2.5.1.2. Filled out squadron training health slide (attachment to email memorandum) sum-
         marizing critical training issues.
         1.2.5.1.3. Complete both the email and the training health slide IAW the guidance and exam-
         ples at the web site https://totn.acc.af.mil/xoya/DOY_RAP/. As low-density, high-demand
6                                                                AFI11-2RQ-4V1 3 FEBRUARY 2007


           assets, RQ-4 units are not aligned with an AEF pair. The RQ-4 training cycle is aligned with
           the AEF cycle.
       1.2.5.2. End-of-Cycle Reports. ACC squadrons will submit an end-of-cycle training report.
       Units will report all deviations from the training requirements in this volume or the RAP tasking
       memorandum, after proration, to ACC/A3Y at the end of the AEF cycle. Include in the report any
       training requirements waived by the Operations Group Commander (OG/CC). Combine and sub-
       mit the end-of-cycle report with the cycle’s last four-month report. Email the end-of-cycle training
       reports to ACC/A3Y. For the end-of-cycle training report format, see Attachment 4, Training
       Shortfall Report.
    1.2.6. Individual crewmembers will:
       1.2.6.1. Hand carry all available training records to assist the gaining unit in assessing qualifica-
       tions and training requirements.
       1.2.6.2. Be responsible for completion of training requirements and currencies within the guide-
       lines of this volume.
       1.2.6.3. Ensure they participate only in ground and flying activities for which they are qualified,
       current, and prepared.

1.3. Training. Training programs are designed to progress individual crewmembers from Initial Qualifi-
cation Training (IQT) or Re-qualification Training (RQT), to Mission Qualification Training (MQT), and
finally to Continuation Training (CT).
    1.3.1. IQT and RQT provide the training necessary to initially qualify or re-qualify crewmembers in
    a basic position and flying duties without regard to the unit’s mission. Upon completion of IQT or
    RQT, the crewmember attains Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) status. BAQ is a prerequisite for
    MQT. Except for general officers above the wing level, BAQ is not a long-term qualification status.
    Waiver authority for any crewmember, other than general officers, to remain BAQ is MAJCOM/A3.
    Refer to Chapter 2 for formal training requirements.
    1.3.2. MQT provides the training necessary to initially qualify or re-qualify crewmembers in a spe-
    cific position and flying duties to perform the missions assigned to a specific unit. Crewmembers
    maintain BAQ status until they complete MQT. Completion of MQT or a Formal Training Unit (FTU)
    instructor course is a prerequisite for BMC status. Completion of MQT is a prerequisite for CMR sta-
    tus. Refer to Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 for MQT requirements.
    1.3.3. There are two aspects of CT. The first consists of crewmember training in basic flying skills.
    These skills (Non-RAP requirements) ensure safe operation of the aircraft. The second consists of
    specific mission-related training required to accomplish the unit’s assigned missions. RAP is the CT
    program designed to focus training toward needed skills. Specific RAP instructions are issued by each
    MAJCOM via a RAP Tasking Memorandum. Refer to Chapter 4 for CT requirements.
    1.3.4. RAP is the CT program designed to focus training on capabilities needed to accomplish a unit’s
    core-tasked missions. With completion of IQT or RQT and MQT, a crewmember is trained in all the
    basic missions of a specific unit, unless a specific exception is provided in Chapter 3. Units then
    assign the crewmember to either a CMR position or a BMC position.

     1.3.4.1. CMR. The minimum training required for crewmembers to achieve and maintain qualifi-
     cation and proficiency in all of the primary core missions tasked to their assigned unit and weap-
     ons system.
     1.3.4.2. CMR Positions. All combat-coded unit API 1 and 2 positions, flying squadron com-
     mander (SQ/CC) and squadron operations officer (SQ/DO) positions are designated CMR posi-
     tions. OG/CCs may designate wing or group API 6 positions not assigned to the flying squadron
     as CMR. (EXCEPTION: If a unit is over-manned, the SQ/CC may elect to train the front line of
     their Unit Manning Document (UMD) crewmembers to CMR and designate the overage BMC. In
     this case, give priority to inexperienced crewmembers with at least 50%, if available, designated
     CMR.) CMR crewmembers maintain proficiency and qualification in all core missions of their
     assigned or attached flying unit. CMR crewmembers maintain currencies that affect CMR status,
     accomplish all core-designated flight training (sorties and events), and complete all mission
     ground training. Failure to complete this training or maintain these currencies results in regression
     to non-CMR (N-CMR) status unless waived by appropriate authority. While N-CMR, crewmem-
     bers may perform missions (including exercises and contingencies) in which they are current and
     qualified similar to BMC crewmembers at the discretion of the SQ/CC.
     1.3.4.3. BMC. The minimum training required for crewmembers to achieve and maintain famil-
     iarization in all primary missions (BMC crewmembers may maintain full qualification and profi-
     ciency in some missions) tasked to their assigned unit and weapons system.
     1.3.4.4. BMC Positions. All group or wing crewmember positions not designated by the OG/CC
     as CMR are designated BMC positions. Assign BMC designations to crewmembers whose pri-
     mary job performance is wing supervision or staff functions that directly support the flying opera-
     tion or are FTU instructors or operational test crews. However, these crewmembers provide
     additional sortie generation capability, either in place of or in addition to, the personnel assigned
     to the flying squadrons. BMC crewmembers maintain familiarization with all unit core missions.
     They may also maintain proficiency and qualification in some of the unit core missions. For those
     missions in which they maintain familiarization only, BMC crewmembers must be able to attain
     proficiency and qualification in 30 days or less. BMC crewmembers accomplish all mis-
     sion-related ground training designated by their attached SQ/CC. BMC crewmembers may deploy
     and participate in any mission for which they are proficient and qualified, without additional train-
     ing, as determined by the SQ/CC. Failure to complete BMC-required training results in regression
     to non-BMC (N-BMC) status. While N-BMC, crewmembers may not perform RAP training sor-
     ties without supervision (per paragraph 1.4.4.) until a SQ/CC approved re-certification program is
     complete.
     1.3.4.5. N-CMR/N-BMC. Crewmembers who regress to N-CMR or N-BMC status will accom-
     plish a program to regain CMR or BMC status IAW paragraph 4.7.1.2.
     1.3.4.6. Specialized Training. Specialized training is training in any special skills that are not
     required by every crewmember, but are necessary to carry out the unit’s assigned missions. Spe-
     cialized training consists of upgrade training as well as CT to maintain proficiency and qualifica-
     tion in unit-tasked special capabilities and missions. Normally, units will accomplish specialized
     training after a crewmember achieves CMR or BMC status. Specialized training requirements are
     usually in addition to CMR or BMC requirements. Unless otherwise specified, crewmembers in
     CMR or BMC positions may hold special capabilities and/or qualifications as long as they accom-
     plish any additional training requirements.
8                                                                 AFI11-2RQ-4V1 3 FEBRUARY 2007


1.4. Training Concepts and Policies:
    1.4.1. Units will design training programs to achieve the highest degree of combat readiness consis-
    tent with flight safety and resource availability. Training must balance the need for realism against the
    expected threat, crewmember capabilities, and safety. This volume provides training guidelines and
    policies for use with operational procedures specified in applicable flying and operations publications.
    1.4.2. ACC Training Support Squadron (TRSS) will develop and validate training programs when
    and where tasked by HQ ACC/A3. Other MAJCOMs may submit requests for training program sup-
    port to the HQ ACC/A3. Once validated, these requests will be prioritized and tasked to ACC TRSS.
    Designated test units may develop syllabi to upgrade operational test crewmembers in support of spe-
    cific test plans. The OG/CC approves these syllabi and submits them to ACC TRSS.
    1.4.3. Units will design training missions to achieve combat capability in squadron-tasked roles,
    maintain proficiency, and enhance mission accomplishment and safety. RAP training missions should
    emphasize either basic combat skills or scenarios that reflect procedures and operations based on
    employment plans, location, current intelligence, and opposition capabilities. Use procedures and
    actions applicable to combat scenarios (e.g., appropriate use of code words, authentication proce-
    dures, combat tactics, safe recovery procedures, tactical deception, in-flight reports, threat reactions,
    intelligence briefing and debriefing).
    1.4.4. Unless specifically directed, the SQ/CC determines the level of supervision necessary to
    accomplish the required training. Mission objectives that include introduction to tasks or instruction to
    correct previous discrepancies may require an instructor.
    1.4.5. Training will include use of aircrew training devices as much as possible.

1.5. RAP Policy and Management:
    1.5.1. The crewmember training cycle is 20 months and is aligned with the AEF cycle. Units will
    complete training requirements during the appropriate training cycle unless specifically excepted.
    1.5.2. Each RAP qualification level (BMC or CMR) is defined by a total number of RAP sorties, bro-
    ken down into Non-RAP (basic-proficiency) sorties and RAP (mission-oriented) sorties.
    1.5.3. The total number of RAP sorties is the primary factor for maintaining an individual’s qualifica-
    tion level. The breakout of sortie and mission types is a guideline to follow as closely as possible, but
    minor variances are authorized. Variations in sortie and mission types may be a basis for regression as
    determined by the SQ/CC. The SQ/CC determines qualification in a mission after considering MAJ-
    COM guidance and the individual’s capabilities.
    1.5.4. An effective RAP training sortie requires accomplishing a mission profile. For training mis-
    sions, accomplishing a mission profile includes completion of at least one RAP event, as listed in the
    RAP Tasking Memorandum and defined in Attachment 2. Operational reconnaissance missions
    count towards RAP sortie requirements.
    1.5.5. The SQ/CC’s first priority is to train all designated crewmembers to CMR.
    1.5.6. Progression from BMC to CMR requires:
       1.5.6.1. A one-month lookback at the higher sortie rate.
       1.5.6.2. Qualification in core missions and events required by CMR.
AFI11-2RQ-4V1 3 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                           9


      1.5.6.3. Confirmation that the progressed crewmember can complete the prorated number of sor-
      tie and event requirements remaining for CMR by the end of the training cycle.
      1.5.6.4. Completion of mission-related ground training, including a current verification.
      1.5.6.5. SQ/CC CMR certification.
   1.5.7. SQ/CCs determine and assign crewmembers that will train for and maintain special capabilities
   or qualifications. Normally, accomplish specialized training in addition to baseline CMR or BMC sor-
   tie and event requirements.
   1.5.8. CMR and BMC crewmembers will fly the required monthly sortie rate. If unable, refer to para-
   graph 4.7., Regression.
   1.5.9. End-of-cycle training requirements are based on the crewmember’s experience level on the last
   day of the current training cycle.
   1.5.10. New units may fly crewmembers in CMR positions at the BMC rate until one month prior to
   the operationally-ready date if the utilization rate will not support CMR sortie rates. Fly CMR crew-
   members at a CMR rate for the month prior to initial operational capability date.

1.6. RAP Training Sortie Program Development:
   1.6.1. RAP sortie and event requirements (see Attachment 2 for definitions) apply to CMR and BMC
   pilot and sensor operator (SO) crewmembers as well as those individuals carrying special capabilities
   or qualifications and are IAW the RAP Tasking Memorandum. The standard sortie requirements in
   Table 1.1. establish the minimum number of RAP sorties per training cycle for inexperienced
   (INEXP) and experienced (EXP) BMC and CMR levels of training. The RAP Tasking Memorandum
   takes precedence over this volume and may contain updated sortie or event requirements not yet
   incorporated in Attachment 2.

Table 1.1. Total RAP 20-Month Cycle Sortie Requirements.
                                                 BMC (INEXP/EXP)               CMR (INEXP/EXP)

RAP Sortie Lookback (1-Month)                      3/2            4/3            6/4              8/6
RAP Sortie Lookback (3-Month)                      9/6           12/9          18/12           24/18

   1.6.2. Non-RAP requirements are in addition to RAP requirements. These sorties and events ensure
   maintenance of basic crewmember skills. Crewmembers may log non-RAP events on RAP sorties
   provided there is no affect on RAP sortie effectiveness. Unit flying hour programs contain sorties for
   crewmembers to accomplish their minimum non-RAP requirements.
   1.6.3. Consider collateral or cost-of-business sortie requirements when developing unit flying hour
   programs. These sorties do not directly relate to combat employment or basic skills training but are
   necessary for accomplishment of day-to-day unit operations. Functional check flights and ferry flights
   are in this category. RAP training does not require these sorties. For the annual training cycle, the
   MAJCOM allocates units a block of sorties, adjusted for local conditions and circumstances, for these
   purposes.
10                                                                 AFI11-2RQ-4V1 3 FEBRUARY 2007


     1.6.4. Unit flying hour programs contain a number of attrition sorties that compensate for non-effec-
     tive training sorties. Log a non-effective sortie when not accomplishing a major portion of valid train-
     ing for a planned RAP or non-RAP training mission due to poor weather, air aborts, etc. In order to
     allocate accurate numbers of attrition sorties to unit flying hour programs, it is essential that units
     appropriately log non-effective sorties.

1.7. Training Records and Reports:
     1.7.1. Units will maintain crewmember records for individual training and evaluations IAW AFI
     11-202V1, AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, and AFI 11-401, Aviation
     Management.
     1.7.2. Units will track the following information for all crewmembers (as applicable):
        1.7.2.1. Ground training.
        1.7.2.2. Requirements and cumulative accomplishment of individual sorties, RAP and Non-RAP
        sorties, sortie types, and events for the training cycle.
        1.7.2.3. RAP sortie requirements and accomplishments using one-month and three-month run-
        ning totals for look-back.
        1.7.2.4. Currencies.
     1.7.3. Units may fill in Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) with either the date of the
     last FTU equivalent accomplished, or the unit mission-certification date.

1.8. Mission Recording. Crewmembers should use and assess all available training documentation on
all missions.

1.9. Crewmember Utilization Policy:
     1.9.1. Commanders will ensure wing-, group-, and squadron-assigned crewmembers (API 1s, 2s, and
     6s) fill authorized positions IAW unit manning documents. In addition, commanders will ensure
     proper designation of status for wing-, group-, and squadron-assigned crewmembers. The overall
     objective is that crewmembers perform operationally related duties. Supervisors may assign crew-
     members to valid, short-term tasks (escort officer, Flying Evaluation Board, mishap board member,
     etc.), but must continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of crew tasking, flying profi-
     ciency, currency, and experience. For inexperienced crewmembers in the first year of their initial
     operational assignment, supervisors will limit non-flying duties to those related to operational activi-
     ties.
     1.9.2. Commanders must ensure that RQ-4 crewmembers assigned duties are commensurate with
     their level of assignment. Units may assign the following duties required by various publications to
     CAF squadron-level crewmembers (API 1s and 2s): tactics officer, programmer, flight safety officer,
     supervisor of flying, mobility and contingency plans officer, training officer (except ARMS documen-
     tation), SQ standardization and evaluation liaison officer, squadron life support officer, electronic
     combat officer, and other duties directly related to flying operations. API 1 or 2 crewmembers will not
     be attached to wing or group staffs or man wing or group staff positions unless total wing, group, and
     squadron RQ-4 crew manning is 100 percent or better. In some instances, such as squadron-assigned
     flight safety officers, units may attach API 1 or 2 crewmembers to the wing. Commanders will assure
AFI11-2RQ-4V1 3 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                        11


   wing-and-above staff crewmembers (API 6s) perform duties justified in MAJCOM manpower stan-
   dards documents and fill positions authorized in UMDs.
   1.9.3. Crewmembers will not perform long-term duties that detract from their primary duties of train-
   ing for or performing the unit flying mission.

1.10. Sortie Allocation Guidance:
   1.10.1. Inexperienced crewmembers should receive sortie allocation priority over experienced crew-
   members. Crewmember experience level definitions are in Attachment 1, Terms. Priorities for sortie
   allocation are as follows:
      1.10.1.1. Formal Training Units. Formal syllabus training, instructor upgrade training, instruc-
      tor CT, authorized staff personnel not performing instructor or flight examiner duties.
      1.10.1.2. Operational Units. Squadron-assigned CMR, squadron-assigned MQT, wing- or
      group-assigned CMR, wing- or group-assigned MQT, BMC, and BAQ.
      1.10.1.3. USAF Weapons School (USAFWS), and Test and Evaluation Squadron Units.
      Requirements directed by MAJCOM, training required to prepare for assigned projects and task-
      ing, BMC training requirements that cannot be accomplished on primary missions.
   1.10.2. Wing or group crewmember authorizations are IAW unit manning documents.
   1.10.3. For wings consisting of both FTU and operational units, at least one of the following will
   maintain formal instructor pilot (IP) status in the RQ-4: Wing Commander (WG/CC), Wing Vice
   Commander (WG/CV), OG/CC, Operations Group Deputy Commander.
   1.10.4. Above-wing-level (API-8) and test unit crewmember authorizations are IAW AFI 11-401 and
   MAJCOM guidance. Above-wing-level and test unit crewmembers will fly the BMC rate; however,
   do not require them to complete BMC-specific missions and events or meet monthly lookback
   requirements. They will accomplish non-RAP requirements within their BMC number of sorties.
   Crewmembers assigned or attached to ACC/IGS as API-6 will maintain RAP currencies and lookback
   per API-8 guidance. Units should provide assigned crewmembers adequate resources to maintain
   minimum training requirements; however, the support will not come at the expense of the flying
   squadron’s primary mission. If units cannot meet attached crewmember requirements, they must
   request relief IAW AFI 11-401, as supplemented. Units requiring flying hour adjustments for attached
   crewmembers must request program changes IAW MAJCOM instructions.
   1.10.5. There is no maximum sortie requirement for CMR crewmembers. Table 1.2. defines the min-
   imum and maximum sortie requirements for other crewmembers. On occasion, unique and/or valid
   operations may require a crewmember to fly more than the maximum number of sorties authorized;
   however, this may impact training of other crewmembers.

1.11. Waiver Authority:
   1.11.1. Unless specifically noted otherwise in the appropriate section, waiver authority for require-
   ments of the RAP Tasking Memorandum and for all provisions in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 of this
   volume is the OG/CC. Unless specifically noted otherwise in the appropriate section, the waiver
   authority for all other provisions of this volume is MAJCOM/A3 or equivalent.

     1.11.2. Units will forward requests for waiver to this volume directly to MAJCOM OPR and provide
     their Numbered Air Force (NAF)/A3 with an information copy. Waivers from other than MAJCOM/
     A3 will include the appropriate MAJCOM OPR as an information addressee. All waivers will include
     HQ ACC/A3Y as an information addressee.
     1.11.3. Waivers to this volume are valid until the end of the current training cycle or earlier if the
     approving official cancels the waiver in writing. Waivers to this volume extending beyond the end of
     the unit training cycle must be resubmitted at the start of each subsequent training cycle.

                                                Chapter 2

                                         FORMAL TRAINING

2.1. General. This chapter outlines the conduct of formal training. Formal training includes IQT, RQT,
MQT, instructor upgrade training, and senior officer training. Normally, individuals complete formal syl-
labus course training at the FTU. In exceptional circumstances, when FTU training is not available within
a reasonable time period, operational units may conduct IQT, RQT, MQT, instructor, and senior officer
formal training IAW provisions of this chapter using appropriate USAF training course syllabus tracks,
flow programs, and requirements.

2.2. Approval and Waivers:
   2.2.1. MAJCOM/A3 is the approval authority for operational units to conduct formal training and is
   the waiver authority to change syllabus requirements for formal training conducted by operational
   units. Forward waiver requests through MAJCOM OPR.
   2.2.2. The MAJCOM commander is the approval authority for non-formal course IQT for colonel
   selects and above conducted at the unit to which the officer is assigned or attached.
   2.2.3. Units will use appropriate channels when requesting approval to conduct formal training at
   other than the FTU. The requests will include the following:
       2.2.3.1. Justification for operational unit training in place of FTU training.
       2.2.3.2. Summary of individual’s flying experience.
       2.2.3.3. Date training will begin and expected completion date.
       2.2.3.4. Requested exceptions to formal course syllabus, with rationale.

2.3. Prerequisites. Course prerequisites and time limitations are IAW this instruction, the appropriate
formal course syllabus and Air Force Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA) at site
https://etca.randolph.af.mil/, USAF Formal Schools. Individuals arriving at the FTU without all prereq-
uisites met or waived may be denied entry into training.

2.4. Ground Training. Units may tailor ground training to individual background and experience or
peculiar local conditions. Use available and current reference materials such as AFTTP 3-1V9, Tactical
Employment--RQ-4, instructor guides, and audiovisual programs as supporting materials to the maximum
extent possible. Accomplish simulator missions in an approved RQ-4 aircrew training device (ATD).

2.5. Flying Training:
   2.5.1. Mission sequence and prerequisites will be IAW the appropriate formal course syllabus flow
   chart and supervision requirements.
   2.5.2. Crewmembers must complete training within the time specified by the approved syllabus. Fail-
   ure to complete training within the specified time limit requires notification through channels to MAJ-
   COM/A3 with crewmember’s name, rank, reason for delay, planned actions, and estimated
   completion date.
14                                                                AFI11-2RQ-4V1 3 FEBRUARY 2007


     2.5.3. Formal course syllabus mission objectives and tasks are minimum requirements. The SQ/CC
     may authorize incorporation of additional training events into the program, based on student profi-
     ciency and background. Additional training due to student non-progression is available within the
     constraints of the formal course syllabus. SQ/CCs may add discretionary additional training sorties as
     required.
     2.5.4. Successful completion of formal course training requires the upgrading crewmember to com-
     plete a flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2, and AFI 11-2RQ-4V2, RQ-4--Crew Evaluation Criteria.

2.6. Initial and Mission Qualification Training. Qualifies new crewmembers in the RQ-4. The sylla-
bus covers IQT and MQT

2.7. Re-qualification Training. Re-qualifies non-current RQ-4 crewmembers.

2.8. Instructor Upgrade Training. Qualifies selected crewmembers for instructor duty. The minimum
requirements for crewmembers identified by the SQ/CC to upgrade to instructor are listed below. OG/CCs
may waive selected instructor prerequisites. Instructor candidates will complete the Instructor Upgrade
Training course as defined in the RQ-4 Pilot and SO Instructor Syllabus and the Air Force ETCA at site
https://etca.randolph.af.mil/, USAF Formal Schools.
     2.8.1. Instructor Pilot Upgrade (IPUG) Training. Pilots selected for IPUG must have:
        2.8.1.1. 1000 hours total pilot flying time (not including Specialized Undergraduate Pilot (SUPT)
        or Joint Undergraduate Navigator Training (JUNT) time) of which 150 hours are primary aircraft
        inventory (PAI) (not including "other" time), or
        2.8.1.2. 500 hours PAI (not including "other" time), or
        2.8.1.3. Previous instructor qualification and 100 hours primary aircraft inventory (PAI) (not
        including "other" time).
     2.8.2. Instructor SO Upgrade (ISOUG) Training. SOs selected for ISOUG must have 250 hours
     PAI (not including "other" time).

2.9. Senior Officer Formal Training:
     2.9.1. All formal training courses for senior officers (colonel selects and above) will be conducted at
     the FTU unless waived IAW paragraph 2.2. above.
     2.9.2. Senior officers must meet course entry prerequisites and will complete all syllabus require-
     ments unless waived IAW syllabus directives.
     2.9.3. Senior officers trained at the FTU at their assigned base are in formal training status and they
     will turn over their unit duties to appropriate deputies or vice commanders until training completion.
     MAJCOM commander is the approval authority for exceptions to this policy.

                              MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. General. MQT is a training program that upgrades newly assigned crewmembers to BMC or CMR
to accomplish the unit mission. RQ-4 MQT is primarily an FTU program conducted as a part of formal
syllabus IQT or RQT courses. Some operational unit training (unit-specific qualifications, initial chemical
warfare (CW), and verification) is required to complete MQT. In unusual circumstances, MQT training
normally accomplished at the FTU may be accomplished with OG/CC approval at the operational recon-
naissance squadron. Operational units will ensure MQT sorties and/or events not accomplished during
IQT or RQT are completed prior to declaring the individual BMC or CMR. Units may tailor their MQT
program for all crewmembers, based on current qualification, experience, currency, documented perfor-
mance, and formal training.
   3.1.1. Crewmembers will complete all operational unit MQT training requirements plus initial verifi-
   cation and initial CW training (ICWT) within 120 calendar days. The 120-day timing starts on the
   crewmember’s first duty day at the gaining operational unit. If the crewmember elects to take leave
   prior to entry into MQT, the timing begins after termination of the leave. SQ/CC certification is
   required for BMC or CMR status. SQ/CCs may certify individuals to BMC or CMR who have com-
   pleted MQT training through a mission flight evaluation prior to completion of initial verification and
   ICWT. Failure to complete the initial verification and ICWT within the 120 calendar days will result
   in regression to N-CMR or N-BMC until qualification is complete. Notify MAJCOM/A3 if training
   exceeds 120 calendar days.
   3.1.2. Crewmembers in MQT will not fly in Flag-level exercises. The OG/CC will determine MQT
   crewmember participation in other exercises.
   3.1.3. Units will establish currency and frequency dates by the date the event or sortie was last accom-
   plished regardless of training status.

3.2. Ground Training:
   3.2.1. Units will develop blocks of instruction covering areas pertinent to the mission as determined
   by the SQ/CC. Units may credit training accomplished during IQT or RQT toward this requirement.
   3.2.2. CMR pilots transferring from another MAJCOM will complete theater-specific ground training
   before flying unsupervised. The ground training will include theater-specific portions of instrument
   refresher course. MQT academics may incorporate this training requirement.
   3.2.3. For initial verification, each crewmember (not required for BMC) will demonstrate a satisfac-
   tory knowledge of the squadron’s assigned mission to a formal board. The SQ/CC establishes the
   board composition. Desired board composition is SQ/CC or SQ/DO (chair), tactics, intelligence, and
   plans representatives. Suggested briefing guide is at Attachment 3.

3.3. Simulator Training. In the event MQT was incomplete at the FTU, units will ensure crewmembers
complete appropriate mission qualification simulator training and evaluation to address the incomplete
syllabus requirements prior to declaring individuals BMC or CMR. Accomplish simulator training in an
approved RQ-4 ATD. See paragraph 3.5. for CW simulator requirements. Squadron commanders are
16                                                                AFI11-2RQ-4V1 3 FEBRUARY 2007


responsible for developing unit- and theater-specific MQT simulator training based on typical squadron
mission requirements.

3.4. Flying Training. In the event MQT was incomplete at the FTU, units will ensure crewmembers
complete appropriate mission qualification flying training and evaluation to address the incomplete sylla-
bus requirements prior to declaring individuals BMC or CMR. Squadron commanders are responsible for
developing unit- and theater-specific MQT flying training based on typical squadron mission profiles.
     3.4.1. MQT flying training requires a squadron supervisor or instructor unless specified otherwise.
     3.4.2. If more than 14 calendar days elapse between sorties, the SQ/CC may authorize an additional
     review sortie before continuing in the program.
     3.4.3. If not previously accomplished in the MQT portion of IQT or RQT, a mission evaluation will
     be conducted IAW AFI 11-202V2, AFI 11-2RQ-4V2, and local standardization and evaluation
     instructions.

3.5. Chemical Warfare. Accomplish IAW MAJCOM guidance. The intent of CW training is to integrate
crewmember training with other functional areas (maintenance, intelligence, security, etc.) required to
conduct combat operations in a CW environment. CW training is applicable to all assigned or attached
CMR and BMC crewmembers deployable to chemical high-threat areas.
     3.5.1. Initial CW Training. ICWT provides initial crewmember qualification and proficiency in the
     overall use of CW protective ensemble and familiarizes crewmembers with combat capabilities while
     wearing CW equipment. Crewmembers who completed ICWT in previous RQ-4 tours are not
     required to accomplish or complete the ICWT simulator.
     3.5.2. Ground Training. All crewmembers will complete CW training IAW, AFPD 10-26,
     Counter-Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Operational Preparedness, AFI 10-2501, Full Spectrum
     Threat Response (FSTR) Planning and Operations, and MAJCOM supplements. Accomplish the fol-
     lowing training prior to the first ATD with CW gear:
        3.5.2.1. Physiological effects and first aid of chemical agents and protective gear.
        3.5.2.2. Equipment orientation and fitting of full CW ensemble. The full CW ensemble for RQ-4
        crewmembers is the standard ground crew chemical protective suit, the MCU-2A/P chemical pro-
        tective mask fitted with a communications microphone, and the aircrew 7mil chemical protective
        gloves.
     3.5.3. ICWT Simulator. Conduct a CW simulator mission in full CW ensemble. The mission will
     consist of a reconnaissance mission profile, emergency procedures, and doffing of simulated contam-
     inated equipment IAW and including current shelter processing procedures.
     3.5.4. CW Certification. SQ/CCs will certify crewmembers as CW qualified upon the completion of
     all initial ground and ATD training.
     3.5.5. CW CT Requirements. Units may credit the initial CW ATD mission toward current training
     cycle CW CT requirements.
AFI11-2RQ-4V1 3 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                         17

                                   CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. General. This chapter and the current RQ-4 RAP Tasking Memorandum outline ground and flying
training requirements for CMR, BMC, and BAQ crewmembers. Units must ensure crewmembers qualify
IAW AFI 11-202V1, AFI 11-202V2, and AFI 11-2RQ-4V2. Crewmembers must complete IQT to fly in
BAQ status, MQT or FTU instructor upgrade to fly in BMC status, or MQT to fly in CMR status.

4.2. Ground Training. Crewmembers will accomplish ground training IAW the Ground Training and
Currencies table in the current RAP Tasking Memorandum. Waiver authority for each event is IAW the
specified reference directive. Where discrepancies exist, the reference directive takes precedence. Units
may credit ground training accomplished during IQT and MQT toward CT requirements for the current
training cycle. Chapter 5 contains specialized programs with both flying and ground training require-
ments.
   4.2.1. Mobility Training. These items are required for mobility units or units that generate in place.
   The following paragraphs and the Ground Training and Currencies table in the current RAP Tasking
   Memorandum delineate required frequencies, references, and affect on CMR or BMC status, mobility,
   or grounding for required mobility ground training:
       4.2.1.1. Chemical Warfare. Units will develop training plans and scenarios for CW training
       based upon anticipated tasking in a wartime environment. Disaster preparedness and intelligence
       personnel will coordinate on and support the CW training program as necessary. Conduct CW CT
       primarily through exercise scenarios complementing the unit’s wartime training from small- to
       larger-scale exercises of sufficient duration to simulate chemical attack survival. Squadrons may
       incorporate CW scenarios into other unit exercises; however, commanders must give careful con-
       sideration to temperatures and the increased demands placed on personnel operating in CW gear.
       Crewmembers will participate in the following annual CW ground training events:
           4.2.1.1.1. Donning the full CW ensemble.
           4.2.1.1.2. Doffing of the CW ensemble using current shelter processing procedures.
           4.2.1.1.3. Understanding the physiological effects of chemical agents and applying the appro-
           priate first aid IAW AFI 36-2238, Self-Aid and Buddy Care Training.
           4.2.1.1.4. Explosive ordnance recognition computer-based training is prerequisite.
       4.2.1.2. Intelligence. Closely align the intelligence training program with the unit tactics and
       electronic combat (EC) training program. The OG/CC determines the focus and extent of aca-
       demic training. Align intelligence academic training with projected wartime tasking, threats, and
       unit equipage. In addition to threat knowledge, crewmember intelligence training will include:
           4.2.1.2.1. Current Intelligence. Current Intelligence is mandatory and will cover significant
           military and political developments (including threat updates) in the squadron’s mission areas
           of interest.
           4.2.1.2.2. Intelligence Oversight Program. Units will conduct this annual training IAW
           Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5240.1-R, Procedures Governing the Activities of
18                                                                AFI11-2RQ-4V1 3 FEBRUARY 2007


            DOD Intelligence Components that Affect United States Persons; and AFI 14-104, Conduct of
            Intelligence Activities, paragraph 7.
            4.2.1.2.3. Unit Intelligence Training. Use guidance contained in AFI 14-104, AFI 14-105,
            Unit Intelligence Mission and Responsibilities; and MAJCOM guidance to develop and man-
            age unit intelligence training programs. The OG/CC determines testing requirements for intel-
            ligence training.
     4.2.2. Crewmember Training. The following paragraphs and the Ground Training and Currencies
     table in the current RAP Tasking Memorandum delineate required frequencies, references, and affect
     on CMR or BMC status, mobility, or grounding for required crewmember ground training:
        4.2.2.1. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM). Units will establish CRM CT IAW AFI
        11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program. CRM training builds upon the
        basic crew management skills taught in SUPT or JUNT and the FTU. Each crewmember will par-
        ticipate in one session every 24 months. Units will track the training in ARMS. Failure to attend
        CRM training results in grounding (waiverable by OG/CC). Briefings and debriefings will include
        the core curriculum of CRM training IAW AFI 11-290 and the appropriate MAJCOM Supplement
        to AFI 11-290. The instructor CRM course may be used to satisfy the 24-month requirement.
        4.2.2.2. Instrument Refresher Course. IAW AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Program
        (IRP), and MAJCOM supplements (pilots only).
        4.2.2.3. Mobile. The training program that qualifies pilots for and maintains their currency to per-
        form the mobile duties associated with the safe aircraft launch and recovery. The mobile pilot is a
        safety observer for aircraft ground operation. The mobile pilot provides the Launch and Recovery
        Element (LRE) and Mission Control Element (MCE) pilots with a view of how the aircraft is
        behaving during taxi, takeoff, and landing. Units will establish initial and continuation training
        requirements for pilot mobile qualification.
        4.2.2.4. Situational Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT) and Instructed SEPT (INSTR
        SEPT).
            4.2.2.4.1. SEPT training is not an evaluation, but a review of abnormal and emergency proce-
            dures and aircraft systems operation and limitations during realistic scenarios. Crewmembers
            should present a situation and discuss actions necessary to cope with the malfunction and carry
            it to a logical conclusion. Squadron special interest items should be emphasized. Incorporate
            the following elements into squadron SEPT training programs:
               4.2.2.4.1.1. SQ/CC and SQ/DO involvement in the selection of a monthly SEPT topic.
               4.2.2.4.1.2. Develop SEPT scenarios using RQ-4 mishaps and incidents as baseline cases.
               4.2.2.4.1.3. Discuss at least one major subsystem emergency procedure (EP) during the
               SEPT session.
               4.2.2.4.1.4. Accomplish at least one SEPT each six months with an instructor or SQ super-
               visor.
            4.2.2.4.2. Accomplish SEPT training each calendar month. Failure to accomplish SEPT train-
            ing by the end of the month will result in grounding until subsequently completed.
AFI11-2RQ-4V1 3 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                        19


        4.2.2.4.3. Accomplish SEPT training in small groups in order that all crewmembers partici-
        pate to the fullest extent and share equal time responding to emergency situations. An ATD
        may be used for an SEPT, if available. SEPTs may be accomplished one on one.
        4.2.2.4.4. Completion of an ATD EP profile satisfies the monthly SEPT requirement. Instruc-
        tors or Flight Examiners (FE) administering the EP profile also satisfy their monthly SEPT
        requirements.
        4.2.2.4.5. FTU student SEPTs satisfy the monthly SEPT requirement for the instructor admin-
        istering this training.
     4.2.2.5. Tactics and Electronic Combat Academic Training. Units will establish an academic
     training program to satisfy MQT and CT tactics and EC requirements. Each training cycle requires
     tactics and EC academic training. Units may use audiovisual programs in place of academic
     instruction. Academic instructors should be USAFWS graduates, be trained by wing or squadron
     tactics personnel, or have attended the applicable academic portions of school such as the Combat
     Air Platforms Employment Seminar, if possible. Instruction and tests should include (as applica-
     ble), but are not limited to:
        4.2.2.5.1. AFTTP 3-1V1, General Planning and Employment Considerations; AFTTP 3-1V2,
        Threat Reference Guide and Countertactics; and AFTTP 3-1V9.
        4.2.2.5.2. Sensor tasking and cross-cueing procedures. Include internal, external, and ad-hoc
        taskings.
        4.2.2.5.3. Lessons learned covering employment planning, employment considerations
        including RQ-4 weapon system logistics (MCE, LRE, bandwidth, etc), and future employment
        options. Include high-altitude aircraft deconfliction procedures.
        4.2.2.5.4. Threat reviews focused on platform-specific considerations and the MCE threat
        avoidance tools. Include system-specific threat avoidance and retrograde options and proce-
        dures with emphasis on current Special Instructions (SPINS). Discuss combat air patrol con-
        siderations.
        4.2.2.5.5. Authentication and safe passage procedures.
        4.2.2.5.6. EC training to enhance crewmember ability to conduct operations in an electronic
        environment. Units will design EC ground training programs to cover topics relevant to RQ-4
        employment. EC training will cover the hierarchy, capabilities, limitations, and potential for
        exploitation of military communications link systems. Include jamming effects on communi-
        cations links, imagery, and the Global Positioning System. The OG/CC determines testing
        requirements for EC training.
        4.2.2.5.7. On-scene commander procedures.
     4.2.2.6. Theater-Specific Ground Training. A thorough review of Central Command (CENT-
     COM), European Command (EUCOM), Northern Command (NORTHCOM), Pacific Command
     (PACOM), and Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) baseline, daily, and weekly SPINS; the Air
     Control Plan; the Air Tasking Order; airfield and airspace Notices to Airman for routine use and
     approved divert airfields; and any other theater-specific guidance necessary for safe and effective
     aircraft employment.
     4.2.2.7. Verification:
20                                                                AFI11-2RQ-4V1 3 FEBRUARY 2007


            4.2.2.7.1. Continuation verification updates crewmembers on their squadron’s wartime mis-
            sions. Each crewmember will participate in a squadron initial or continuation verification
            every 18 months as a briefer, board member, or seminar participant. Crewmembers who par-
            ticipate in a unit deployment to a tasked theater of operations may receive credit for continua-
            tion verification.
            4.2.2.7.2. Although BMC crewmembers are not required to accomplish an initial verification
            and/or participate in continuation verifications, they may do so to facilitate future upgrade to
            CMR status, at the discretion of the SQ/CC.
     4.2.3. Air Force Awareness Program Training. This training is required for all Air Force person-
     nel. The Ground Training and Currencies table in the current RAP Tasking Memorandum delineates
     required frequencies, references, and affect on CMR or BMC status, mobility, or grounding for
     required Air Force Awareness Program ground training.
     4.2.4. Ground Currencies. The Ground Training and Currencies table in the current RAP Tasking
     Memorandum delineates required frequencies, references, and affect on CMR or BMC status, mobil-
     ity, or grounding for required ground currencies.
     4.2.5. Simulator Training. Accomplish training in an approved RQ-4 ATD.
        4.2.5.1. The Non-RAP 20-Month Cycle Requirements table in the current RAP Tasking Memo-
        randum depicts the minimum ATD training requirements. ATD sorties require instructor supervi-
        sion in order to satisfy annual requirements. Units may authorize crewmembers to conduct
        unsupervised simulator sorties for individual proficiency provided there is no interference with
        scheduled training. Unsupervised simulator sorties do not satisfy annual requirements. Units
        should determine additional CT training device supervision requirements based on expected
        employment tasking, training device capabilities, and mission training objectives.
        4.2.5.2. Units will develop scenarios that cover contingencies, fault codes, and pilot terminal area
        procedures. In addition, units will develop mission scenario requirements based on expected
        employment tasking and training device capabilities. Scenarios should place emphasis on training
        not readily attainable during daily flying activities. Units will review scenarios annually and
        update as required.
        4.2.5.3. Crewmembers may receive credit for training accomplished in special devices such as
        higher headquarters (HHQ) directed simulator test support, etc., if approved by the SQ/CC.
        4.2.5.4. Each crewmember will accomplish an ATD training sortie in full CW ensemble once each
        training cycle. Within the mission profile, practice doffing simulated contaminated equipment.
        CW ATD missions complement existing ATD mission profiles. CW missions do not increase ATD
        requirements.
        4.2.5.5. Accomplish EP missions in an ATD.
     4.2.6. Sensor Operator Imagery Interpretation Training. Sensor Operators who are Air Force
     Specialty Code 1N1X1s must maintain core competency knowledge, skills, and abilities as career
     imagery interpreters. Use assigned MAJCOM Command Intelligence Personnel Training Program
     (CIPTP), and the 1N1X1 Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) to develop and manage
     SO 1N1X1 skill-level and continuation training. Prioritize and focus the 1N1X1 CFETP and CIPTP
     training programs to expected theaters of operation. This 1N1X1 career field training does not affect
     CMR status.

     4.3.6. Airspace Procedures Training. Units will develop airspace and instrument flight rules aca-
     demic programs applicable to worldwide RQ-4 operations. Units will include theater-specific airspace
     procedures in their pre-deployment spin-up training programs. Units will include a course on flight
     operations in adverse weather conditions with emphasis on RQ-4 limitations and capabilities in the
     theater-specific academic training.
     4.3.7. Electronic Combat. The objective of EC training is to enhance crewmember ability to con-
     duct operations in an electronic environment. Flying training missions typically should include
     EC-oriented operations and considerations. Units must make every effort to maximize effective use of
     limited assets as well as instill awareness and actions appropriate to the EC environment.

4.4. Special Categories:
     4.4.1. Flight Surgeon. Flight surgeons may participate in continuation training missions as observ-
     ers. Units will develop appropriate continuation training mission orientation programs for assigned
     flight surgeons.
     4.4.2. Above-Wing-Level Crewmembers:
        4.4.2.1. Mission Directed Training (MDT) for HHQ personnel (other than that conducted in sup-
        port of a formal inspection) requires coordination with the supporting unit. MAJCOM Division
        Chiefs and NAF/A3 are the reviewing authorities for assigned personnel. They will:
            4.4.2.1.1. Coordinate with the supporting agency to ensure maintenance of appropriate ARMS
            data and provide that data IAW AFI 11-401.
            4.4.2.1.2. Review assigned crewmember accomplishments and currencies prior to authorizing
            participation in MDT. Provide specific currencies to the host squadron.
            4.4.2.1.3. Determine crewmember qualifications to participate in squadron scenarios for
            MDT.
            4.4.2.1.4. Provide each crewmember with written documentation specifying the authorized
            sortie types and events the crewmember may fly. Above-wing-level crewmembers who fly
            with only one unit may receive this from their attached unit commander.
AFI11-2RQ-4V1 3 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                            23


       4.4.2.2. HHQ flying personnel maintaining BMC status are exempt from academic ground train-
       ing, CW training, and special training programs within authorized mission areas.
       4.4.2.3. Crewmembers will:
          4.4.2.3.1. Review accomplishments and currencies for accuracy.
          4.4.2.3.2. Submit qualification and authorization documentation to the supporting SQ/CC or
          operations officer prior to flying with that squadron.
          4.4.2.3.3. Evaluate the demands of each mission scenario and ensure that they do not exceed
          their ability and proficiency.
       4.4.2.4. With the concurrence of the OG/CC, instructor-qualified crewmembers may perform
       instructor duties provided they have qualification and currency for the applicable missions and
       events.

4.5. Multiple Qualification and Currency:
   4.5.1. MAJCOM/A3 may authorize qualification in more than one mission design series (MDS) for
   crewmembers only when command mission requirements direct such action and dual qualification is
   economically justifiable. MAJCOMs cannot delegate this authority. Unless required for unit mission
   accomplishment, commanders must not permit crewmembers qualified in primary mission aircraft to
   maintain qualification in support aircraft.
       4.5.1.1. Submit multiple qualification requests through command channels to MAJCOM/A3. All
       requests must contain full justification. Units will provide multiple qualification approval to the
       appropriate host base aviation management office. Do not authorize flight accomplishments until
       aircraft assignment is updated in ARMS.
       4.5.1.2. Individually authorized multiple qualifications are valid as long as the individual remains
       assigned to the specific position and aircraft unless rescinded by MAJCOM/A3.
   4.5.2. Multiple qualification is not appropriate for senior wing supervisors of units with different
   types of aircraft. WG/CCs will qualify in only one of their wing’s aircraft. Either the WG/CV or OG/
   CC should qualify in another of the wing’s aircraft (not the one selected by the WG/CC). Wings will
   comply with MAJCOM policy on senior supervisor familiarization flights.
   4.5.3. Crewmembers qualified in multiple aircraft will satisfy at least 50 percent of the sortie require-
   ments of their primary aircraft in that aircraft. If crewmembers are CMR, they will meet all RAP sortie
   and event requirements of the primary aircraft. In addition, crewmembers will fly an equitable distri-
   bution of training requirements in each MDS to fill their non-RAP requirements.
   4.5.4. Crewmembers qualified in multiple aircraft will fly at least once each 45 days in each aircraft.
   They will comply with all other currency requirements for each aircraft.
   4.5.5. Crewmembers must complete conversion training IAW an approved syllabus.

4.6. Currencies, Re-currencies, and Re-qualification:
   4.6.1. Currency. Table 4.1. defines currency requirements for all RQ-4 crewmembers. If a crew-
   member loses a particular currency, the individual may not perform that sortie or event except for the
24                                                             AFI11-2RQ-4V1 3 FEBRUARY 2007


     purpose of regaining currency as noted. Instructors may log events for currency when performing
     instructor duties.

2. Supervision level for re-currency over 60 days is an IP or instructor sensor operator (ISO) current in
   the sortie. No instructor required for re-currency less than 60 days.
3. Prerequisite is the appropriate theater-specific (CENTCOM, EUCOM, NORTHCOM, PACOM, or
   SOUTHCOM) ground training.
4. Supervision level for re-currency is an IP or ISO current in event.
5. Non-currency for 61-180 days requires a re-currency flight with an instructor. Non-currency for 181
   and more days requires a flight evaluation.
6. Crewmembers must be current in this event to fly unsupervised. Pilots performing employment mis-
   sions in the MCE are not required to have LRE currencies. Pilots performing start, taxi, takeoff, and
   landing duties at a forward LRE site are not required to have MCE currencies.
7. Crewmembers and instructors may update currency or obtain re-currency (Note 4 applies) in an
   ATD. Crewmembers and instructors may update this currency or obtain re-currency once in an ATD
   and then the next update must be an actual event.
8. MCE pilot may log this event if logging primary time for the event.

   4.6.2. Re-currency. Crewmembers require re-currency whenever they exceed a currency require-
   ment in this volume.

      cable to the type of training in which delinquent. Training annotated as affecting CMR status will
      require regression to N-CMR until accomplishing appropriate training as specified by SQ/CC.
      Training identified as not affecting CMR status does not require regression from CMR, although it
      may result in grounding until completing training. The duration of grounding and status of sortie
      lookback will determine the effect on CMR status.
      4.6.2.2. Unless otherwise specified, the SQ/CC determines supervisory requirements pertaining
      to re-currency.

     4.6.3. System Re-currency. Loss of both LRE takeoff and landing currency and MCE approach cur-
     rency requires the following action (timing starts from the last LRE taxi and takeoff, LRE landing, or
     MCE approach currency event):
        4.6.3.1. LRE – 31-90 (46-90 for Experienced) Days. Regain LRE takeoff and landing currency.
        Supervision level is an instructor qualified and current in the sortie.
        4.6.3.2. MCE – 46-90 (60-90 for Experienced) Days. Regain MCE approach currency. Supervi-
        sion level is an instructor qualified and current in the sortie.
        4.6.3.3. 91-135 Days. Same as paragraph 4.6.3.1. and 4.6.3.2. above, plus instructor supervised
        ATD including:
            4.6.3.3.1. For CMR crewmembers: tactics, normal, and emergency procedures.
            4.6.3.3.2. For BMC crewmembers: normal and emergency procedures.
        4.6.3.4. 136-180 Days. Same as paragraph 4.6.3.3. above, plus qualification and tactical written
        examinations and emergency procedures evaluation (EPE).
        4.6.3.5. 181 or More Days. Sorties, events, and ATDs as determined by the SQ/CC plus qualifi-
        cation and tactical written exams, EPE, and qualification and mission flight evaluation.
     4.6.4. LRE Takeoff and Landing Re-currency. Pilot is still current in the MCE. Loss of takeoff and
     landing currency in the LRE only requires the following action:
        4.6.4.1. Regain LRE takeoff and landing currency. Supervision level is an instructor qualified and
        current in the event.
        4.6.4.2. SQ/CC determines sortie and event training requirements to regain currency.
     4.6.5. MCE Approach Re-currency. Pilot is still current in the LRE. Loss of MCE approach cur-
     rency only requires the following action:
        4.6.5.1. Regain MCE approach currency. Supervision level is an instructor qualified and current
        in the event.
        4.6.5.2. SQ/CC determines sortie and event training requirements to regain currency.
     4.6.6. Loss of and Re-qualification to Instructor Status. Decertify instructors if:
        4.6.6.1. They fail a flight evaluation. To regain instructor status, the instructor must successfully
        complete a flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2RQ-4V2.
        4.6.6.2. They fail a qualification, instrument, or tactical examination. To regain instructor status,
        the instructor must successfully accomplish the written exam.
        4.6.6.3. Their instructor currency expires. To regain status, see Table 4.1.
        4.6.6.4. They become non-current in an event or sortie that causes removal from CMR or BMC
        status and the SQ/CC deems that loss of currency is of sufficient importance to require de-certifi-
        cation. If the SQ/CC does not elect this option or if the instructor becomes non-current in events or
        sorties which do not require removal from CMR or BMC status, the individual may retain instruc-
        tor status, but the instructor will not instruct in that event or sortie until regaining the required cur-
        rency.
AFI11-2RQ-4V1 3 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                          27


4.7. Regression:
   4.7.1. CMR or BMC Regression for Failure to Meet Lookback. If crewmembers do not meet
   RAP lookback requirements throughout the training cycle, SQ/CCs may regress them to N-CMR or
   N-BMC status, as applicable, remove them from a CMR manning position, or initiate action to
   remove them from active flying status.
       4.7.1.1. Failure to meet one-month RAP or contingency operations sortie lookback requires a
       review of the crewmember’s three-month sortie history. If the crewmember meets the three-month
       lookback, the crewmember may, at SQ/CC discretion, remain CMR or BMC. Failure to meet the
       three-month lookback will result in regression to N-CMR or N-BMC status as appropriate, or the
       SQ/CC may place the crewmember in probation status for one month. If the SQ/CC chooses pro-
       bation, the only way to remove a crewmember from probation and preserve the current status is to
       reestablish a one-month lookback at the end of the probation period. (See Figure 4.1.)
       4.7.1.2. CMR or BMC crewmembers regressed to N-CMR or N-BMC for lookback must com-
       plete a SQ/CC-approved re-certification program to return the crewmember to CMR or BMC
       standards. Upon completion of the re-certification program, the CMR or BMC crewmember also
       must meet the subsequent one-month lookback requirement prior to reclaiming CMR or BMC sta-
       tus. Units may credit the sorties and events accomplished during the re-certification program
       toward the individual’s total and type sortie and event requirements for the training cycle as well
       as for the monthly sortie requirement.
       4.7.1.3. Lookback computations begin following SQ/CC designation of the crewmember to BMC
       or CMR. The crewmember must maintain one-month lookback until establishing a three-month
       lookback. If a new CMR or BMC crewmember fails to meet one-month lookback while establish-
       ing three-month lookback, SQ/CCs may apply probation rules as described in paragraph 4.7.1.1.
       In addition, one-month lookback starts the first full month of CMR or BMC status.
   4.7.2. Unqualified Crewmember Evaluations. Handle crewmembers who fail a qualification,
   instrument, or mission evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2. Crewmembers will regress to N-CMR or
   N-BMC as applicable. These crewmembers will remain N-CMR or N-BMC until successfully com-
   pleting required corrective action, a reevaluation, and are re-certified by the SQ/CC.
   4.7.3. Failure to Maintain Flying Standards. If a qualified crewmember demonstrates lack of pro-
   ficiency or knowledge during CT (not related to a flight evaluation) the SQ/CC may elect to regress
   the individual to N-CMR or N-BMC as applicable. These crewmembers will remain N-CMR or
   N-BMC until successfully completing corrective action as determined by the SQ/CC, an evaluation if
   required, and are re-certified by the SQ/CC.

4.8. End-of-Cycle Requirements. Crewmembers who fail to complete sortie and/or event requirements
of this volume by the end of the training cycle may require additional training depending on the type and
magnitude of the deficiency. Refer to paragraph 4.9. to determine if the unit may prorate some of these
requirements. In all cases report training shortfalls IAW paragraph 1.2.5.
   4.8.1. Crewmembers who fail to meet the total annual RAP sortie requirement may continue CT at
   CMR or BMC as determined by lookback. The SQ/CC will determine if these crewmembers require
   additional training.
28                                                                   AFI11-2RQ-4V1 3 FEBRUARY 2007


     4.8.2. Crewmembers who fail to meet annual non-RAP sortie and/or event requirements may con-
     tinue CT at CMR or BMC as determined by lookback. The SQ/CC will determine if these crewmem-
     bers require additional training.
     4.8.3. Failure to meet RAP sortie-type requirements will result in the following:
         4.8.3.1. Regression to N-CMR or N-BMC if the SQ/CC determines that the sortie-type deficiency
         is significant. To regain CMR or BMC, the crewmember will complete all deficient sortie types.
         Units may count these sorties against the total requirements for the new training cycle.
         4.8.3.2. Continuation at CMR or BMC if the crewmember maintains total RAP sorties and look-
         back and the SQ/CC deems the sortie type deficiencies insignificant.
     4.8.4. Failure to accomplish sorties required for special certification or qualification will result in loss
     of that certification or qualification. The SQ/CC will determine re-qualification requirements.

4.9. Proration of End-of-Cycle Requirements. At the end of the training cycle, the SQ/CC may prorate
all training requirements when duties not to involve flying, emergency leaves, non-flying temporary duty
(TDY) or exercises, and combat contingency deployments preclude training for a portion of the training
period. Do not consider normal annual leave as non-availability. Units may consider extended bad
weather that precludes the unit from flying for more than 15 consecutive days as non-availability. The fol-
lowing guidelines apply:
     4.9.1. Only use proration to adjust for genuine circumstances of training non-availability, not to mask
     training or planning deficiencies.
     4.9.2. Base proration on cumulative days of non-availability for flying during the training cycle. Use
     Table 4.2. to determine the prorated number of months based on cumulative calendar days of
     non-availability. Determine the prorated number of training events based on the prorated number of
     months.

AFI11-2RQ-4V1 3 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                         31


  4.9.3. If a crewmember is non-available for training and loses currency requiring a tailored re-quali-
  fication training program plus a flight evaluation IAW paragraph 4.6.3.4., then the crewmember’s
  training cycle starts over at a prorated share of the remaining months in the training cycle following
  completion of the re-qualification training and flight evaluation.
  4.9.4. An example of proration for non-availability is that Captain Jones took 17 days of emergency
  leave in January and then attended in-residence Squadron Officers School (SOS) from March through
  April for 56 consecutive calendar days. Capt Jones’ SQ/CC authorized a total of two months (17 days
  emergency leave plus 56 days at SOS equals 73 cumulative days) of proration from his training.
  4.9.5. Round prorated numbers resulting in fractions of less than 0.5 to the next lower whole number,
  but prorate no requirement below one.
  4.9.6. Consider newly assigned or converted crewmembers and crewmembers who achieve CMR or
  BMC after the 15th of the month to be in CT on the first day of the following month for proration pur-
  poses. Units may prorate events and sorties for the remainder of the training cycle. Crewmembers
  must complete a prorated share of RAP sorties in CT.
  4.9.7. SQ/CCs may prorate a crewmember’s last month on station prior to departing permanent
  change of station (PCS) provided they do not exceed one month’s proration. Units may consider indi-
  viduals departing PCS CMR for reporting purposes for 60 days from date of last flight, or until loss of
  CMR currency, port call date, or sign in at new duty station.
  4.9.8. Contingency operations may have a positive or negative impact on a unit’s CT program, as
  emphasis is on supporting the actual contingency. A potential lack of training opportunities while
  deployed may place a burden on the unit, forcing the unit to accomplish the majority of its CT pro-
  gram in a reduced period of time at home station. Units may log sorties flown during contingency
  operations as RAP sorties or contingency operations sorties. The following proration procedures pro-
  vide flexibility in accomplishing the unit’s CT program:
     4.9.8.1. RAP Sorties During Contingencies. Because the training quality of missions flown at
     contingency locations may vary considerably, units may log sorties flown at contingency locations
     that provided valid training as RAP sorties. Events accomplished on these sorties count toward
     RAP event requirements, and units may not prorate these sorties and events upon return to home
     station.
     4.9.8.2. Contingency Operations Sorties. If missions flown at a contingency location do not
     provide valid RAP training, log the missions as Contingency Operations sorties and do not count
     them toward annual RAP requirements. Units may use Contingency Operations sorties for look-
     back purposes. RAP events logged during Contingency Operations sorties do not count toward
     annual RAP requirements, but may update currencies. After returning from contingency opera-
     tions where Contingency Operations sorties are logged, units will prorate RAP sorties and events
     for the period of time each individual was deployed. In addition, units may prorate for the deploy-
     ment preparation and deployment recovery time where MAJCOM reduces home station flying.
     4.9.8.3. Post-Contingency Proration. Upon return from contingency operations, compute prora-
     tion by calculating the total proratable sorties for the entire deployment, and then subtracting the
     number of valid RAP sorties. The result is the allowable sortie proration. Negative numbers equal
     zero. Prorate events at SQ/CC discretion based on the events accomplished during valid RAP sor-
     ties.

4.10. Regaining CMR or BMC Status:
     4.10.1. If a crewmember loses CMR or BMC status due to failure to meet the end-of-cycle event
     requirements, re-qualification is IAW paragraph 4.7.
     4.10.2. If a crewmember loses CMR or BMC status due to failure to meet lookback IAW paragraph
     4.7., the following applies (timing starts from the date the crewmember came off CMR or BMC sta-
     tus):
        4.10.2.1. Up to 90 Days. The crewmember must complete a SQ/CC directed re-certification pro-
        gram IAW paragraph 4.7.1.2. In addition, the crewmember must regain all RAP event currencies.
        The SQ/CC will approve any other additional training prior to re-certification to CMR or BMC.
        4.10.2.2. 91-180 Days. Same as 4.10.2.1. above, plus qualification and tactical written examina-
        tions.
        4.10.2.3. 181 Days and Beyond. Sorties, events, ATDs, and ground training as determined by the
        SQ/CC, plus qualification and tactical written exams, EPE, and qualification and mission flight
        evaluation. The individual’s training cycle will start over at a prorated share following completion
        of the flight evaluation.

4.11. Lookback, Regression, Proration, & Re-qualification Process Example. Captain Smith is an
experienced CMR crewmember with a one- and three-month lookback requirement of four and twelve
RAP sorties respectively. On February 3, Captain Smith flew an MCE Mission sortie prior to departing
for a non-flying TDY staff tour for two months. Captain Smith reported back for flight duty on 6 April.
What is Captain Smith’s status throughout the TDY and on return to flying duty?
     4.11.1. The SQ/CC wanted to list Captain Smith as a countable CMR crewmember for reporting pur-
     poses throughout the TDY. Therefore, on 1 March, Captain Smith’s Flight Commander (FLT/CC) per-
     formed the mandatory one-month lookback (February). Captain Smith only flew three RAP sorties,
     failing the one-month lookback. The FLT/CC then performed a three-month lookback (Dec, Jan, and
     Feb). This three-month lookback showed that Captain Smith flew only ten sorties for the period. Had
     Captain Smith flown two more sorties, the SQ/CC could continue him at CMR. However, with ten
     sorties, Captain Smith did not meet the three-month lookback for a CMR crewmember. The SQ/CC
     could regress Captain Smith to N-CMR, but instead elected to put him on probation, still carrying him
     as CMR.
     4.11.2. The SQ/CC carried Captain Smith on one month’s probation during March. On 1 April, Cap-
     tain Smith’s one-month lookback (March) was zero sorties. The SQ/CC must now regress Captain
     Smith to N-CMR. When Captain Smith returns on 6 April, the SQ/CC must place him in a re-certifi-
     cation program. Upon completing this program, Captain Smith must then reestablish a one-month
     lookback by 1 May. Failing to reestablish a one-month lookback by 1 May forces the unit to report
     Captain Smith N-CMR one more month until the next lookback process on 1 June.
     4.11.3. If Captain Smith had returned on 22 March while still being carried in probationary CMR sta-
     tus, he must fly four RAP sorties to recapture a one-month lookback and achieve removal from proba-
     tion. If Capt Smith was non-current for LRE takeoff and landing, he must fly a non-RAP LRE sortie
     with an instructor to regain LRE takeoff and landing currency before flying MCE sorties to build
     lookback.
AFI11-2RQ-4V1 3 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                       33


  4.11.4. At the end of the training cycle, the SQ/CC prorated two months of Captain Smith’s total
  requirements. In spite of this proration, Captain Smith was deficient in RAP sorties. The SQ/CC could
  regress Captain Smith to N-CMR, if deemed significant. After he accomplished the tailored re-certifi-
  cation program (the deficient sorties), the SQ/CC re-certified Captain Smith to CMR. The sorties
  flown for CMR re-certification count for the new training cycle.

                                                 Chapter 5

                                       SPECIALIZED TRAINING

5.1. General. This chapter outlines duties and responsibilities for units to upgrade, qualify, and maintain
proficiency and currency for special capabilities and special qualifications. These capabilities and qualifi-
cations are in addition to core missions for the unit and do not apply to every crewmember assigned or
attached to the unit.

5.2. Pre-Deployment Training. Conduct this training prior to deploying in support of contingency oper-
ations (if time permits) or exercises. The objective of this training is to ensure crewmembers’ ability to
conduct all missions in support of expected tasking. For contingency operations, units are responsible for
contacting appropriate gaining command to determine expected mission tasking. For exercises, units are
responsible for referring to appropriate exercise plans (EXPLAN) and contacting appropriate exercise
points of contact prior to deployment to determine expected mission tasking. Refer to MAJCOM/A3 exer-
cise and joint training division for the current list of exercises and EXPLANs. Prior coordination ensures
unit preparation for the appropriate tasking and allows the responding OG/CC to tailor spin-up training
for the theater, threat, and tactics for the assigned task. The SQ/CC is responsible for implementing
spin-up training, prosecuting the required missions, and determining the specific requirements necessary
to reach the desired level of proficiency. Units will place emphasis on training needed for missions not
accomplished in daily operations. Conduct spin-up training IAW all applicable instructions.
     5.2.1. Attached and Augmenting Crewmembers. Crewmembers not assigned to the deploying
     squadron must receive spin-up training as determined by the deploying SQ/CC. This requirement
     applies to all attached crewmembers (OG, WG, HQ staffs, etc.), and all crewmembers augmenting
     from other squadrons (operational or FTU). The objective of this spin-up training is to ensure attached
     and augmenting crewmembers are proficient to conduct all missions in support of expected tasking.
     The deploying SQ/CC determines the amount of spin-up training required for each attached and aug-
     menting crewmember based on the individual’s level of proficiency, currency, qualification, experi-
     ence, etc. For augmenting crewmembers, once the augmented SQ/CC determines the amount of
     spin-up training, the augmentee’s SQ/CC is responsible for ensuring spin-up training accomplish-
     ment.
     5.2.2. Ground Training. All applicable crewmembers will complete academic training prior to
     deployment. Units will brief contingency or exercise SPINS, Rules of Engagement (combat) or Train-
     ing Rules, and command and control. Programs will emphasize deployment airfield capabilities, lim-
     itations, approach procedures, and hazards. In addition, cover area environment (weather) and unique
     operating procedures. The local Weather Flight can assist with weather-unique training. MAJCOM
     intelligence organizations will assist the unit’s intelligence functions in the development of threat
     assessments, training materials, and expected collection tasking.
     5.2.3. Flying Training. Tailor spin-up training to ensure all deploying crewmembers are proficient,
     current, and qualified in all expected mission tasking.
     5.2.4. Responsibility. OG/CCs are responsible for ensuring all participating crewmembers are ready
     to deploy and are proficient to conduct all missions in support of expected tasking.

5.3. Forms Prescribed. None.

Terms
Aircrew Training Device—A training device used to prepare aircrew members for the actual
performance of flight duties. The official categories for ATDs are Flight Simulators, Flight Training
Devices, Aircraft System Trainers, and Other (for those that do not fall into the first three categories).
ATDs are cockpit familiarization trainer, cockpit procedures trainer, operational flight trainer, part-task
trainer, and weapon system trainer to name a few.
Attrition Sortie—A sortie planned and launched as a RAP training sortie, Non-RAP sortie, or collateral
sortie, that, due to some circumstance (weather, in-flight emergency, maintenance, etc.), fails to
accomplish the planned mission. It is imperative that units log these sorties properly. Improper accounting
of these sorties will result in improper sortie allocation, stresses to the unit schedule, and negative impacts
to the quality of unit training programs.
Basic Aircraft Qualification—A status of a crewmember who has satisfactorily completed training
prescribed to maintain the skills necessary to fly unit aircraft or operate mission systems. The
crewmember must perform at the minimum frequency necessary to meet the most recent sortie and flight
standards set for the weapon system. The crewmember will carry BAQ only until completion of MQT.
BAQ is not a permanent qualification except for general officers above the wing level, and any other
crewmembers specifically authorized by MAJCOM A3. BAQ crewmembers will not perform
RAP-tasked combat events or sorties without instructor crewmembers or SQ supervisor supervision.
Basic Mission Capable—The status of a crewmember who has satisfactorily completed training (MQT)
prescribed for full qualification to perform the basic unit operational missions, but does not maintain
CMR status. Crewmembers accomplish training required to remain familiarized in all, and may maintain
qualification and proficiency in some, of the primary missions of their weapon system and unit. These
crewmembers may also maintain special capabilities.
Contingency Operations Sortie—A mission flown at a contingency location which does not provide
valid RAP training and does not count toward annual RAP requirements. Units may use Contingency
Operations sorties for lookback purposes. RAP events logged during Contingency Operations sorties do
not count toward annual RAP requirements, but may update currencies.
Combat Mission Ready—A status of a crewmember who has satisfactorily completed training (MQT)
prescribed for full qualification to perform the basic unit operational missions, and maintains qualification
and proficiency in these missions. All squadron-assigned crewmembers, squadron commanders,
operations officers, and OG/CC-designated wing- or group-level positions will maintain this qualification
level. EXCEPTION: If a unit is over-manned, they may elect to train the front line of their UMD to CMR
with the overage designated as BMC. Units must select inexperienced crewmembers for approximately
50% of their CMR positions.
AFI11-2RQ-4V1 3 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                         41


Continuation Training—Training to maintain proficiency and improve crewmember capabilities to
perform unit missions and crewmember proficiency sorties not flown in formal syllabus missions, tests,
or evaluations. Applicable to CMR and BMC crewmembers.
Currency—The minimum frequency required to perform an event or sortie safely.
Data Analysis Workstation (DAWS) Trainer—A part-task trainer that operates independently of the
ground station. DAWS trainers are used to train SOs on the fundamentals of target collection and provide
hands-on training with the mission collection software.
Emergency Procedures Evaluation—An evaluation of crewmember knowledge and responsiveness to
critical and non-critical EPs conducted by an FE in an ATD, or the MCE. An EPE may be administered
orally if an appropriate training device is not available.
Experienced Crewmember—
   Pilots:—An experienced pilot has: 500 hours PAI, or 1000 hours total pilot flying time (not including
   SUPT or JUNT time) of which 150 are PAI. PAI does not include "other" time.
   SOs:—An experienced SO has 250 hours PAI.
Initial Qualification Training—Training to qualify a crewmember in basic aircraft flying duties without
specific regard to the unit’s operational mission. The minimum requirement for Basic Aircraft
Qualification status.
Instructor Upgrade Training—Training to qualify a crewmember to perform instructor duties.
Mission Qualification Training—Training required to achieve a basic level of competence in unit’s
primary tasked missions. This training is a prerequisite for CMR or BMC status.
Pilot Stand Alone Trainer—A pilot part-task trainer that operates independent of the ground station.
Most elements of flying the airplane and emergency procedures training may be accomplished, but the
system lacks the ability to conduct mission training.
Primary Aircraft Inventory—Aircraft authorized for performance of the operational mission. The PAI
forms the basis for allocation of operating resources including manpower, support equipment, and
flying-hour funds. The operating command determines the PAI required to meet their assigned missions.
Proficiency—Demonstrated ability to successfully accomplish tasked event safely and effectively. For
purposes of this volume, proficiency also requires currency in the event, if applicable.
Situational Emergency Procedures Training—A discussion and review of abnormal and emergency
procedures and aircraft systems operations and limitations based on realistic scenarios.
Specialized Training—Training in specialized tactics or flight responsibilities such as instructor, etc.
Units may conduct this training in MQT or CT, as required.
Squadron Operations Supervisor—The squadron Operations Supervisor must be filled by the
operations officer, assistant operations officers or senior flight commanders deemed qualified by the
squadron commander and approved by the OG/CC. Squadron commanders can always fill the Operations
Supervisor position, if available. See AFI 11-418.
Tactical Deception—Any activity designed to mislead the enemy operational commander by
manipulating, distorting, or falsifying evidence, thereby inducing the enemy to act in a manner favorable
to our interests or desires (see AFI 10-704, Military Deception Program).

             GLOSSARY OF SORTIE, EVENT, AND CURRENCY DEFINITIONS

A2.1. Sortie Definitions:
   A2.1.1. Non-RAP Sorties (Pilots only)
       A2.1.1.1. Collateral Sorties. These sorties do not directly relate to combat employment or basic
       skills training but are necessary for accomplishment of day-to-day unit operations. Ferry flights,
       functional check flights (FCF), Operational Check Flights (OCF) are in this category. RAP and
       non-RAP training does not specify requirements for these sorties. For the training cycle, the MAJ-
       COM allocates units a block of sorties, adjusted for local conditions and circumstances, for these
       purposes.
          A2.1.1.1.1. FCF Sortie. An FCF sortie is a maintenance sortie that is necessary to validate
          major maintenance performed on the aircraft. FCF sorties are normally flown following major
          phase inspections.
          A2.1.1.1.2. Ferry Sortie. A sortie that is used to reposition the aircraft for operational or
          maintenance purposes.
          A2.1.1.1.3. OCF Sortie. An OCF sortie is a maintenance sortie that is necessary to check a
          component and/or sub-system of the aircraft.
       A2.1.1.2. LRE Sortie. An LRE sortie is any sortie accomplished from the Launch and Recovery
       Element. Minimum requirements to log an LRE sortie are: At least one hour of primary time, a
       takeoff and departure or a landing. Instructors may also log an LRE Sortie while conducting
       upgrade training provided they meet the above requirements.
   A2.1.2. Pilot and Sensor Operator Non-RAP ATD Sorties:
       A2.1.2.1. CRM SIM. A simulator training event that focuses on CRM. Emergency procedures
       may be accomplished during this simulator in order to facilitate the CRM process.
       A2.1.2.2. CW SIM. Simulator sortie in which Pilot and/or SO perform duties while wearing the
       full CW ensemble as described in AFI 11-2RQ-4V1, Para. 3.5.
       A2.1.2.3. EP SIM (Pilot Only). A simulator training event that focuses on the proper application
       of procedures and techniques during an emergency procedure scenario.
       A2.1.2.4. EP SIM (SO Only). A simulator training event that focuses on the SO’s role during the
       proper application of procedures and techniques during an emergency procedure scenario.
       A2.1.2.5. System SIM. Any simulator sortie which does not involve emergency procedures (e.g.
       IQT, and difference training.
   A2.1.3. RAP Sorties. MCE Sorties are RAP sorties. Total individual twenty-month RAP sorties are
   tracked for sortie lookback. When logging MCE Sorties, the training tracking program automatically
   increments a RAP sortie.
       A2.1.3.1. MCE Mission Sortie. MCE Mission Sorties are combat mission scenario profiles that
       relate to unit’s DOC statement requirements. Minimum requirements to credit an MCE Mission
       Sortie are an intelligence scenario, combat mission planning, threat evaluation, and sensor execu-
44                                                                  AFI11-2RQ-4V1 3 FEBRUARY 2007


        tion. In addition to the above requirements, a minimum of two hours of primary flight time in the
        MCE is required to credit an MCE Mission Sortie. The SQ/CC or SQ/DO may approve the log-
        ging of an effective sortie with less than two hours of primary time on a case by case basis. MCE
        Mission sorties are normally scheduled for four hours primary time. Instructors may also log an
        MCE Mission Sortie while conducting upgrade training provided they meet the above require-
        ments.
        A2.1.3.2. One-month Sortie Lookback. Total individual RAP sorties that are tracked for a
        30-day time period. This lookback is used to assess individual progress in achieving the Total Sor-
        ties (minimum) required for the 20-month training cycle.
        A2.1.3.3. Three-month Sortie Lookback. Total individual RAP sorties that are tracked for a
        90-day time period. This lookback is used to assess individual progress in achieving the Total Sor-
        ties (minimum) required for the 20-month training cycle
        A2.1.3.4. Total Sorties (Tot Srtys). Total individual RAP sorties required for the twenty-month
        training cycle.

A2.2. Events. Unless otherwise specified in the event descriptions, units will determine the necessary
parameters for fulfilling and/or logging tasked events. Listed events are for fulfilling tasked requirements.
In the absence of guidance, units determine the content of tasked events and how often to log them.
Events are defined as accomplishing a specific type of reconnaissance employment performed during a
sortie or accomplishing a specific training element, function, or task (e.g. Comm Link Configuration).
     A2.2.1. Pilot Non-RAP ATD Events:
        A2.2.1.1. Contingency 1 (C1) Lost Communication. A C1 is a return to base, approach, and
        landing that is accomplished without any available command and control links with the aircraft.
        The aircraft flies a preprogrammed route to a landing when command and control communica-
        tions to the aircraft are lost for a pre-designated amount of time. The pilot is responsible for ensur-
        ing that all airspace is kept clear and that all necessary personnel and agencies are made aware of
        the aircraft’s situation and predicted flight path.
        A2.2.1.2. Contingency 2 (C2) Return to Base (RTB). A C2 is an autonomous or pilot com-
        manded condition which brings the aircraft to a landing at a selected airfield usually due to the loss
        of a redundant aircraft system. An approach that is accomplished as a result of a C2 event occur-
        ring on the aircraft wherein the aircraft executes an RTB in a C2 state.
        A2.2.1.3. Contingency 3 (C3) Emergency Landing. A C3 is an approach that is accomplished
        as a result of an engine-out condition or other critical aircraft system fault that results in an engine
        shutdown at the initial approach fix. An emergency approach initiated either engine-on or
        engine-out.
        A2.2.1.4. Contingency 4A. A contingency 4A is an autonomous or pilot commanded missed
        approach and go-around.
        A2.2.1.5. Contingency 4B. A contingency 4B is an autonomous or pilot commanded takeoff
        abort.
     A2.2.2. Pilot Non-RAP Events:

     when performing instructor duties.
     A2.2.2.3. Holding. Holding consists of using the Suspend command to establish a holding orbit.
     A2.2.2.4. Landing. Landing phase of flight and normal post-mission duties logged in the LRE.
     MCE pilot may log this event if logging primary time for the event.
     A2.2.2.5. Taxi and Takeoff. Taxi and takeoff procedures consist of normal pre-launch duties in
     the LRE and aircraft taxi, takeoff, and departure.
  A2.2.3. Pilot RAP Events:
     A2.2.3.1. GOTO, Override Command. A GOTO is a navigation command that returns the air-
     craft to autonomous steering by directing the aircraft to a pre-defined point along the flight path.
     Override steering commands provide the ground station control of the aircraft heading or track,
     airspeed, altitude, and vertical velocity.
     A2.2.3.2. Initial Scheme of Maneuver (SOM). The initial SOM is the plan that establishes the
     methods by which the target deck is collected. The initial SOM is completed prior to takeoff.
     A2.2.3.3. Route Plan (AFMSS). Event requiring a pilot to create mission plan from takeoff to
     landing, to include one C3 Approach, using the Air Force Mission Support System (AFMSS)
     flight planning program.
  A2.2.4. SO Non-RAP ATD Events:
     A2.2.4.1. Integrated Sensor System (ISS) Preflight. A test of the ISS to ensure it is functioning
     within design parameters and limitations.
  A2.2.5. Sensor Operator RAP Events:
     A2.2.5.1. Electro-Optical (EO) and Infrared (IR) Point Target (PT TGT). Point Target mode
     on the EO and IR Collection Planner is designed to capture a series of EO or IR spot images of the
     same target in rapid succession.

     designed to capture an infrared image of a large swath of land area.
     A2.2.5.4. Mission Planning. The tasks performed by the SO prior to mission execution. These
     include devising a SOM for the aircraft, importing the target deck into DAWS, building a target
     tracker, preparing MCE and Global Hawk Operations Center workstations, and conducting the tar-
     get prosecution segment of the mission brief.
     A2.2.5.5. Moving Target Indicator (MTI). A collection mode on the Synthetic Aperture Radar
     (SAR) Planner designed to search large areas for moving targets.
46                                                                AFI11-2RQ-4V1 3 FEBRUARY 2007


        A2.2.5.6. SAR Point Target (SAR Pt Tgt). A mode on the SAR Collection Planner designed to
        capture a series of SAR SPOT images of the same target in rapid succession.
        A2.2.5.7. SAR Wide Area Search (Search C, M, H). A search mode on the SAR Collection
        Planner that collects SAR imagery of a swath of land area in Coarse, Medium, or High resolution.

        LRE. MCE pilot may log this event if logging primary time for the event. MCE pilot does not
        require LRE landing currency to control the aircraft for an MCE landing; however, MCE approach
        currency is required.
        A2.3.1.3. LRE Instructor Duties. An LRE event logged by an instructor when performing
        instructor duties during a sortie, or a portion thereof. The instructor qualification is required and
        used for the mission itself or a mission element. Examples include upgrade sorties, updating lost
        currencies, etc. Evaluators will log this event on evaluation sorties.

shortfalls: NOTE: Detailed instructions on preparation of an official Air Force memorandum can be
found in AFMAN 33-326, Preparing Official Communications.


MEMORANDUM FOR ACC/A3Y                                                                               Date
FROM: xx RS
SUBJECT: xx RS Training Shortfall Report
     1. Summary of Previous Report Results and Issues. (Use paragraph one to provide a brief sum-
        mary of unresolved issues from previous report.)
     2. Past 4 Months (Status and Issues). Each squadron shall provide a PowerPoint slide encompass-
        ing the four months since the last report. Slide template is available from https://totn.acc.af.mil/
        xoya/DOY_RAP/. Use paragraph two to expand on Critical Issues, LIMFACS and Shortfalls,
        AEF Training Issues, or Get Well Plan areas of the required slide, or to report any items of special
        interest not covered by the slide template. If current slide information does not require more detail
        in paragraph two, simply state “All data reported on required slide. No expanded details to
        report.” Critical issues may include, but are not limited to, any of the following conditions:
        a. MQT is averaging more than 120 days (per person) to complete.
        b. Upgrades are less than 50% of desired number to maintain a productive training environment
           commensurate to train to RAP standards.
        c. Experience level drops below 40%.
        d. Squadron Commander considers RAP training health in poor condition.
        e. Average sortie count falls to more than two below requirement for lookback month.
        f. Current or projected taskings (real world tasking, exercises, etc.) pose a significant negative
           impact on squadron’s ability to train to RAP standards.
        g. Training effectiveness of AEF or contingency mission sorties is considered poor.
        h. Aircraft modification programs or upgrades pose a significant negative impact on squadron’s
           ability to train to RAP standards.
        i. LIMFACS, shortfalls or other training problems can be considered a trend or condition which,
           if unchecked, has the potential to become a critical condition. For example, if the squadron is
           unable to accomplish sensor CT events due to a shortage of sensors, a shortfall exists that if
           unresolved could deteriorate to a critical condition affecting MQT, upgrades, or RAP training
           health.
     3. Commander’s Comments: This is an open forum for specific concerns regarding the squadron’s
        training health. Examples include non-critical resource issues or those the commander feels could
AFI11-2RQ-4V1 3 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                    49


      affect RAP training. Provide a projection of the squadron’s ability to accomplish 20 month RAP
      requirements. Comments to improve the training reporting system are also voiced here.
