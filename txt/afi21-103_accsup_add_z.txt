1. General. The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW AFI 21-103. MESLs lay the ground
work for reporting the status of aircraft capability. They list the minimum essential systems and
subsystems that must work on an aircraft for it to perform specifically assigned unit wartime,
training, test or other missions. Mission Ready Available (MRA) is used in readiness Status of
Resources and Training System reporting only and denotes Mission Capable (MC) aircraft

capable of being configured for a contingency mission in accordance with COMACC
OMNIBUS Plan.
     1.1. Notes. Qualifying notes are used to define aircraft exceptions and help explain complex
     degraded mission systems such as suspension equipment.
     1.2. Status. Aircraft status for generation and deployment: The goal is to generate or deploy
     Fully Mission Capable (FMC) aircraft, recognizing status actually achieved may be less than
     FMC. A Not Mission Capable (NMC) aircraft may be deployed provided it is safe for flight
     and can be configured and generated to MRA status at an employment site.
     1.3. Generation. All ACC units will generate, or deploy and regenerate, using ACC MESLs.
     Major Command differences in MESLs are acknowledged. Upon actual deployment to
     another MAJCOM theater, the gaining MAJCOM has the responsibility to resource and
     specify the unit's requirements and resource the differences in support/mission equipment.
     1.4. Reading the MESL. A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by work unit
     code (WUC) against the Full Systems List (FSL) and all applicable Basic Systems List (BSL)
     across the page. Each unit's Design Operational Capability (DOC) statement determines
     applicability of BSL columns. The aircraft MESLs incorporate all ACC assigned aircraft;
     therefore, it is important to compare only those columns listed in the MESL that are
     applicable to the unit's assigned aircraft. For example, units with CC (combat) coded aircraft
     would determine and report status using only the FSL and BSL columns related to their DOC
     statement. Units with TF (training) coded aircraft would determine and report status using
     only the FSL and TNG columns, and units with CB (test) coded aircraft would determine and
     report status using only the FSL and TST columns. Units with multiple coded aircraft will
     ensure status is reported using the MESL columns appropriate to the individual aircraft
     assignment code. For T-38A coding refer to Table 1.
