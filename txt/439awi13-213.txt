                                            Chapter 1

                                           GENERAL

1.1. Applicability. All personnel operating a vehicle on the airfield at Westover ARB, must be
familiar with local airfield driving procedures as outlined in this instruction, and must have a
valid AF Form 483, Certificate of Competency, endorsed for airfield driving.
1.2. Environment. Vehicles are required on the airfield to support operations and maintenance.
Although government owned vehicles (GOVs) provide the bulk of required vehicle support,
some situations require augmentation by privately owned vehicles (POVs). Vehicle traffic
greatly amplifies the potential for collisions, injury, foreign object damage (FOD) to aircraft, and
security incidents. Positive control of vehicles and vehicle operations is imperative.

       with engines running or about to start.

Figure 4.1. Caution 1.




       4.1.5.3. Most golf carts are not equipped with speedometers, so extra care should be used
       to ensure speed limits do not exceed 15 mph.
       4.1.5.4. Carts must be equipped with headlights and taillights when operating during
       periods of darkness and/or inclement weather.
439AWI13-213 13 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                   13


   4.1.6. Airfield Speed Limits. Note: Emergency vehicles may exceed the speed limits only
   when responding to an emergency. Use lights and sirens; however weather conditions and
   safety are the utmost importance in responding to any emergency.
      4.1.6.1. Westover ARB Aircraft Parking ramps-15 mph maximum.
      4.1.6.2. Taxiways—25 mph maximum.
      4.1.6.3. Airfield Access Roads/Bypass Roads and Perimeter Roads—15 mph maximum.
      Note: The grass area at the approach end of any runway is off limits to vehicles. Only

      the tower informs the operator to expedite off the runway due to arriving/departing
      aircraft or other situation that requires the runway to be free of vehicles, the ground
      vehicle operator will depart the runway immediately at the nearest taxiway and at a safe
      speed.
      4.1.6.7. Vehicle Parking areas-15 mph maximum.

Figure 4.2. Caution 2.




   4.1.7. All Airfield access points are marked with FOD signs. All ground vehicle operators
   will stop and check tires for FOD prior to entering any portion of the airfield. When motor
   vehicles are operated on unpaved surfaces, rocks may become lodged between dual wheels
   and gravel may stick in the tire treads. For this reason, paved access roads will be utilized for
   all vehicles transitioning to and from the airfield whenever possible. Security Forces vehicles
   responding to alert conditions are exempt; however, all-terrain vehicles will remain clear of
   the airfield unless mission essential. Ground vehicle operators will stop and check tires for
   FOD prior to entering any portion of the airfield. If there is excessive debris that cannot be
   immediately cleaned up, the driver will contact base operations via FM radio using the ramp
   net (call sign ―Airfield Ops‖) or landline (557-2951/2917) and request a sweeper.
   4.1.8. Taxiways. Used by aircraft to get to and from the parking ramp/apron and the runway.
      4.1.8.1. Ground vehicle operators will not drive on the taxiway centerline unless they are
      specifically checking the pavement condition or checking for FOD. Normally, the only
      vehicles that will drive on the centerline are Airfield Management vehicles (AFLD 1/
      AFLD 2 and AFLD 3, Follow-Me vehicles, and the airfield sweeper (Sweeper 1).
14                                                      439AWI13-213 13 SEPTEMBER 2011


     4.1.8.2. Ground vehicle operators will drive on the far right-hand side of the taxiway in
     reference to the vehicles direction of travel. Emergency response vehicles may travel on
     the near right-hand side, but safety and caution will be observed.
     4.1.8.3. Taxiing Aircraft:
         4.1.8.3.1. Follow Me vehicles are the only vehicles authorized to operate in front of a
         taxiing aircraft. No vehicles will cross between the Follow Me vehicle and an aircraft
         taxiing.
         4.1.8.3.2. At night, vehicle headlights will be turned off when a taxiing aircraft
         approaches a vehicle from the front; parking lights will remain on. Vehicles with
         daytime running lights will avoid pointing the lights at moving aircraft. The
         responsibility to avoid aircraft rests with ground vehicle operators and, if necessary,
         reverse course to quickly move out of the way. Only as a last resort should the vehicle
         be driven off prepared surfaces to ensure adequate wingtip clearance for the aircraft.
         4.1.8.3.3. Rules for operation of vehicles around aircraft:
             4.1.8.3.3.1. Will not cross a taxiway or cross in front of an approaching aircraft
             that is within 200 feet or until the aircraft has passed by at least 200 feet (F4, F15,
             F16, F18, A10), 350 feet (KC135, B52, B1, E3, C141, C17), 500 feet (C5, E4,
             KC10, Boeing 747).
             4.1.8.3.3.2. Will remain at least 100 feet away from any helicopter with its rotors
             in motion.
             4.1.8.3.3.3. Will yield the right-of-way to emergency response vehicles with
             rotating lights or flasher in motion.
             4.1.8.3.3.4. Will yield the right-of-way to any vehicle already operating on a
             taxiway they wish to enter or cross.
     4.1.8.4. Operators of a disabled vehicle will not leave the vehicle unattended on taxiways
     or runways. The operator must use the ramp net or signal another driver for assistance. In
     the event of an emergency the vehicle may be pushed off the paved surface. The driver
     will contact Base Operations or the Control Tower and report the disabled vehicle and
     location, to assist getting the disabled vehicle off the airfield, especially the parking
     aprons, taxiways, and runway.
  4.1.9. Tire chains/studded tires may only be employed on airfield pavements after obtaining
  coordination/approval from Airfield Management, Safety and Civil Engineering. Requesting
  agency will conduct an operational risk assessment with the above agencies when evaluating
  the need for tire chains to minimize pavement damage and FOD hazard. Vehicles with
  studded tires are not authorized to operate on the airfield.
  4.1.10. Operators will avoid driving over in-ground fuels to prevent damage to the pit covers
  and vehicle tires.
  4.1.11. Smoking is prohibited on the airfield in other than designated areas. Smoking areas
  on the East Ramp are defined in the Westover Circle of Safety Pamphlet.
  4.1.12. Jet Blast Areas and distance requirements are outlined in the Westover Circle of
  Safety Pamphlet.
439AWI13-213 13 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                15


4.2. Operating In or Across the CMA. Direct two-way radio contact with the Control Tower
is mandatory for any vehicle operating in the CMA.
   4.2.1. If radio contact is lost or suspected lost while operating in the CMA, operators will
   monitor the tower for light gun signals while immediately exiting the CMA. Repeated
   changes in intensity of runway lights signifies a need from the tower to communicate with
   the driver either by radio or light gun signal, and is an indication to immediately exit the
   CMA. If radio failure is known or suspected, proceed to Airfield Management and brief them
   on the incident.
   4.2.2. To enter or cross the CMA, the following procedures will be followed:
      4.2.2.1. Contact the control tower and receive permission. Upon receiving permission,
      repeat the control tower’s instructions verbatim before proceeding. (See Attachment 2,
      Radio Phraseology, for additional guidance and proper phraseology.)
      4.2.2.2. If equipped, top-mounted rotating emergency lights/flashers must be in operation
      while in the CMA. Vehicles not equipped with top-mounted emergency lights may use
      dash or grill mounted lighting. As a minimum, the hazard lights will be turned on.
      4.2.2.3. Personnel in the CMA must constantly monitor their two-way radio for
      instructions from the control tower.
      4.2.2.4. When finished operating in the CMA, contact the tower and report off. Note 1:
      Personnel requiring access in the CMA that do not have two-way radio contact with the
      tower must be escorted. The escort must be authorized to drive on the airfield, be familiar
      with CMA procedures, and have direct two-way radio contact with and approval from the
      control tower prior to entering the CMA. Note 2: Only the control tower may grant
      permission for ground vehicle operations in the CMA—permission may not be requested
      or granted from any other source. Three-way relayed messages to the control tower are
      prohibited. Operators must be in direct radio contact with Tower on CE, Ramp, and
      Security or Maintenance nets. All personnel will maximize the use of perimeter road for
      access to the far side of the airfield. No one will attempt to access the runways without
      first contacting airfield management for permission. Traffic across the runways will be
      kept to an absolute minimum.
4.3. Runway Hold Lines.
   4.3.1. Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Hold Line and Instrument (INST) Hold Line (see
   attachments 8 and 9). VFR hold lines are located on taxiways N, Y, F, R, G, PAD19, PAD23,
   PAD33 and at the intersection of runways 15/33 and 05/23. VFR hold lines consist of four
   lines—two solid yellow and two dashed yellow lines—extending across the width of the
   taxiway/runway. All aircraft, ground vehicles and pedestrians must stop at the hold lines,
   have direct two-way radio contact with, and receive approval from the control tower prior to
   crossing this line to enter the runway.
4.4. Airfield Emergencies.
   4.4.1. Ground vehicle operators will yield the right-of-way to all emergency and fire/crash
   vehicles with emergency flashers/rotating lights in motion.
   4.4.2. Ground vehicles not in direct support of the emergency will remain clear of taxiways,
   the runway, and airfield access points until the emergency is terminated.

4.5. Control Tower Light Gun Signals. All government vehicles operating on the airfield
must be equipped with a tower light gun signal decal. These decals may be obtained from
http://www.faa.gov/runwaysafety/ or http://afpubs.hq.af.mil (AFVA 11-240, Control Tower
Light Signals) or Airfield Manager.
4.6. Vehicle Parking and Operations Near Aircraft.
   4.6.1. Do not back vehicles toward an aircraft without a spotter and pre-positioned chocks.
   Note: Vehicles (maintenance, contractors, mowers, etc.) operating near obstacles on the
   airfield such as taxiway/runway guidance signs, instrument landing system equipment,
   approach lights, etc., will use extreme caution, and in the case of backing up towards these
   obstructions use a spotter to avoid damage to the vehicle and costly equipment.
   4.6.2. Do not drive vehicles between aircraft and fixed or mobile objects when there is less
   than a 25-foot clear zone without a spotter present.
   4.6.3. Vehicle operators who must park the vehicle on the airfield will leave the vehicle
   unlocked, engine off, parking brake set, and transmission in park and in the appropriate white
   boxes. The operator will leave the keys in the ignition when leaving the vehicle unattended.
       4.6.3.1. Park so that the direction of travel, either forward or backward, will not be
       toward any part of the aircraft.
       4.6.3.2. Always park the vehicle so the driver has a clear view of the aircraft (in
       accordance with AFMAN 24-306, Chapter 25 and AFOSHSTD 91-100, Chapter 6).
   4.6.4. All aircraft ground equipment (AGE) equipment will be secured in accordance with
   appropriate Technical Orders or Air Force Instructions.
   4.6.5. Use caution when operating near aircraft with engines running or about to start. See
   Westover ARB Circle of Safety pamphlet for further guidance.
   4.6.6. No vehicle will park in front of hangar doors. This area must be kept clear for aircraft
   towing operations and a minimum 25’ wing-tip clearance must be maintained.
4.7. Routes of Travel. Passenger buses and other large vehicles are prohibited from using
taxiways to travel the length of the airfield, with the following exceptions:

         REPORTING, ENFORCEMENT AND VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES

6.1. General. Gross or repeated violations of safety or Airfield driving rules, or an overall
demonstrated lack of ability on the part of the certificate holder will result in a suspension of
airfield driving privileges, surrender of the certificate, or revocation of the certificate. Units will
provide specific information (who, what, when, where, how) for trend analysis. Note: The Unit
Commanders, ADPMs (for unit assigned personnel), AM and SF personnel can temporarily
suspend airfield driving privileges.
   6.1.1. The AFM or designated representative is authorized to confiscate AF Form 483 and/or
   airfield POV passes from any individual violating the provisions of this instruction.
   6.1.2. The AFM or designated representative is authorized to revoke airfield-driving
   privileges of individuals violating the provisions of this instruction or performing unsafe acts
   on the airfield. A revocation memorandum will be sent to the offender’s unit commander
   with a courtesy copy sent to the OG/CC and AOM.
6.2. Suspension. Any supervisor in the driver’s chain of command may suspend a driver’s
certificate. All suspensions will be reported to the airfield driving program manager and airfield
manager. Failure to complete annual refresher training (or if there is no documentation of annual
training) is cause for competency card suspension.
6.3. Surrender. All certificate holders will surrender their AF Form 483 upon request by the
unit airfield driving program manager and/or Airfield Management personnel. Surrendered
certificates will be forwarded to Airfield Management. Airfield drivers who PCS, separate, retire,
or no longer need their certificates should turn them in to the unit airfield driving program
manager for disposal.
6.4. Revocation. AF Form 483 may be revoked by the unit airfield driving program manager,
airfield manager, AOM, or designated representative. Once revoked, another certificate will not
be reissued without the explicit approval of the airfield manager. The Host Wing Commander
may reinstate airfield driving privileges in writing to perform mission essential duties following
suspension/revocation of base driving privileges. Authority must not be delegated.
6.5. Violations of this airfield driving instruction within a 12-month period will carry the
following penalties: See Attachment 12, Corrective Actions for Violations.
   6.5.1. First Violation: See Attachment 12, Corrective Actions for Violations
   6.5.2. Second Violation: 1-year suspension of airfield driving privileges.
   6.5.3. Third Violation: Permanent suspension of airfield driving privileges.
   6.5.4. CMA Violations/Runway Intrusions are the most serious violations resulting result in
   an automatic 30-day suspension of airfield driving privileges.
       6.5.4.1. For CMA/runway intrusions that have an adverse impact on flight operations
       (arrivals, departures, etc.), an AF Form 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR), will
       be submitted to 439 AW/SE within 24 hours of incident. All CMA violations will be
       documented in the AOB minutes.

                       POVS ON THE AIRFIELD AND POV PASSES

8.1. General. POV access to the airfield without a Temporary Pass or Permanent POV pass
issued is prohibited. No other means will be used to authorize POV access. The AFM will issue,
and strictly control airfield POV passes, to ensure the total numbers of passes issued are kept to
the absolute minimum. POV operation on the airfield is discouraged for several reasons (e.g.,
security, safety, FOD, liability) and will be kept to the absolute minimum. POV access to the
airfield requires a pass be issued from Airfield Management.
8.2. POV passes are requested/issued and validated at the being of the Fiscal Year.
   8.2.1. The requesting official will:
   8.2.2. Request Permanent Airfield POV passes, from the Airfield Manager or designated
   representative.
   8.2.3. If approved for a Permanent POV pass will be placed on the drivers’ side dash so it is
   clearly visible. Place the temporary vehicle pass in the same manner as the Permanent pass.
   When vehicles are not being operated on the airfield, remove the pass(s) from the dash.
   8.2.4. Use the POV pass for official business only.
   8.2.5. In writing, re-certify the need for a POV pass annually.
   8.2.6. Return passes to the Airfield Manager for accountability when they are no longer
   needed due to permanent change of station (PCS), reassignment, separation, or sale or
   disposal of vehicle. Note: Passes are issued for a specific vehicle(s). Do not interchange
   them between multiple vehicles.
8.3. Commanders and Key Personnel. Individuals requesting permanent POV passes will
complete a request memorandum obtained from the AFM. The Airfield Manager reviews the
valid need to respond to the airfield in their POV for mission related reasons. A pass is issued to
an individual and is to be used for that individual’s specific vehicle and license plate number.
The pass will be returned when the individual no longer requires airfield access with the POV.
Request for a vehicle pass must be endorsed by the individual’s unit commander.
8.4. Deployed/Transient/TDY Personnel. Use of POVs and rental vehicles on the airfield for
deployed unit missions, inspection teams, etc., may be authorized by the Airfield Manager or
designated representative on a case-by-case basis. Deployed/Transient/TDY Personnel must have
a valid AF Form 483 from their home station prior to driving on the Westover ARB airfield.
Additionally, they will be briefed by the sponsoring/host unit on the airfield layout and proper
procedures prior to driving on the airfield. An airfield diagram and Light Gun signal chart will
remain in the vehicle at all times.
8.5. Government Vehicles. All mission support GOV, GSA vehicles, and special purpose
vehicles are authorized on the airfield. These are easily recognizable as GOV/GSA vehicles and
are not required to display any special identification.
8.6. Non-Government Vehicles.

  8.6.1. Construction Contractors. Contractor vehicles working construction or repair projects
  on the airfield will be authorized access only by the Airfield Manager or designated
  representative. The Airfield Manager or designated representative will brief contractors on
  control and safety requirements and acceptable routing at pre-construction meetings. POV
  passes (if issued) will be turned in at the end of the project(s).
  8.6.2. Mission Contractors. The 439 CONF/LGC will provide justification for access to the
  airfield to the Airfield Manager. Upon approval from the Airfield Manager, a pass will be
  issued for the period of the contract. Passes will be returned to the Airfield Manager when no
  longer needed or when the contract ends. The 439 CONF/LGC shall ensure all airfield
  construction contracts include the requirement for the contractor personnel to receive training
  on airfield driving and safety within 5 days before starting to work.

439AWI13-213 13 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                   27


Airfield Operations Flight Commander (AOF/CC) or Airfield Operations Manager
(AOM)—Responsible for the overall operation/services provided by the airfield operations flight
in support of the wing-flying mission and in compliance with USAF and FAA guidelines.
Base Operations—A facility located near the airfield that provides aircrews with flight plan
processing and planning services.
Controlled Movement Area (CMA)—The runways, taxiways, and other areas of an airport
which are utilized for taxiing, air/hover taxiing, takeoff, and landing of aircraft, exclusive of
loading ramps and parking areas (see Attachment 7, Controlled Movement Area Map). Radio
contact must be established with and specific approval must be received from Westover ground
control when operating on the CMA; additionally, all vehicle operator requirements for airfield
driving privileges are mandatory. If two-way radio contact is lost on the on the runway
immediately exit, then face the tower and flash head lights, Tower will respond with Light Gun
Signals. Note: Any other method of communicating with the control tower for clearance on or
into the CMA or to cross/enter runways, especially cellular telephones, is prohibited. Cellular
telephones do not constitute ―TWO-WAY RADIO‖ communications.
Controlled Movement Area Violation (CMAV) Event—An airfield infraction caused by
aircraft, vehicles, or pedestrians entering the control movement area without specific control
tower approval. This definition includes runway incursions and infractions caused by
communication errors. There are three categories, Operational Error, Pilot Deviation, and
Vehicle/Pedestrian)
Foreign Object Debris (FOD)—Any debris on the airfield that can cause damage to an aircraft.
A few examples are tools, plastic packing materials, rocks, discarded parts from maintenance
activities, etc. Any of these objects can shred internal parts if sucked into a jet engine and can
become deadly projectiles. FOD can create an extremely hazardous and costly situation during
taxiing, takeoff, and landing; therefore, it is imperative that everyone on the airfield be alert to
FOD and removes it immediately.
Government Owned Vehicle (GOV)—Any vehicle, including bicycles, wholly owned or leased
by the U.S. government. Note: Rental vehicles authorized on military orders will be considered a
GOV; however, operators must obtain a temporary POV pass to driving on the airfield.
Parking Ramp/Apron—Areas where aircraft are parked, loaded and unloaded, and serviced
between flights. Vehicles and aircraft operate in close proximity in these areas, so it is vital to
maintain a safe distance between your vehicle and aircraft. Always yield to aircraft and never
drive under an aircraft or its wings. Slow speed and extreme caution are required in these areas.
POV Pass (Permanent)—Issued and controlled by the Airfield Manager authorizing non-
military vehicles to operate on the airfield for a 1-year time period. These passes are usually
issued to individuals with authorization requiring access to the airfield.
POV Pass (Temporary)—Issued and controlled by the airfield manager or designated
representative authorizing non-military vehicles to be temporarily operated on the airfield. POV
pass will be placed on the dashboard of the vehicle on the driver’s side and returned when no
longer needed or expired.

Privately Owned Vehicle (POV)—Any vehicle, including bicycles, not owned or leased by the
U.S. government. The terms ―Privately Owned Conveyance (POC)‖ and ―Private Motor Vehicle
(PMV)‖ are interchangeable with POV.
Restricted Area—Any area containing protection level resources; Protection level resources are
collected into defined areas and controlled using a single security control system. Personnel
requiring entry into these areas must possess an AF Form 1199B, Restricted Area Badge.
Runway Incursion—Any occurrence at an aerodrome involving the incorrect presence of an
aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-
off of aircraft. For the purpose of this instruction, the protected area is the same as the CMA.
These are further classified into three operational categories:
1) Operational Error (OE)—A failure of the air traffic control system that results in loss of
separation.
2) Pilot Deviation (PD)—The action of a pilot that results in the violation of ATC instructions,
AFIs and/or FARs.
3) Vehicle/Pedestrian Deviation (V/PD)—Any entry or movement on the controlled movement
area by a vehicle (including aircraft operated by non-pilots) or pedestrian that has not been
authorized by Air Traffic Control.
Taxilane—Ramp space between rows of parked aircraft used to maneuver aircraft to and from
parking spots and taxiways.
Taxiway—A paved surface for taxiing aircraft from parking ramp to runway.
Unit—For the purpose of this AFI, the term unit is equivalent to a Squadron, also known as the
basic unit in the USAF organizational structure. Squadrons are usually made up of several flights
(typically four), and commanded by a field grade officer.
Visual Flight Rule (VFR) Hold Line—VFR hold lines are located on taxiways N, Y, F, R, G,
PAD19, PAD23, PAD33 and at the intersection of runways 15/33 and 05/23. VFR hold lines
consist of four lines—two solid yellow and two dashed yellow lines—extending across the width
of the taxiway/runway. All aircraft, ground vehicles and pedestrians must stop at the hold lines,
have direct two-way radio contact with, and receive approval from the control tower prior to
crossing this line to enter the runway. Note: Vehicle visor placards are highly encouraged and
recommended for use in airport vehicles to serve as a quick reference guide to identify airport
signs    and      markings.     Check   the   Runway       Safety    Office    web     site    at
http://www.faa.gov/runwaysafety/ for information on how to obtain copies for unit vehicles, or
stop by Base Operations to obtain a copy.
Wing Airfield Driving Program Manager—The civilian or military individual selected by the
squadron/unit commander to administer the organization’s vehicle program, to include operation
of vehicles on the airfield and associated training.
Wing Commander—The individual with ultimate responsibility for operating the airfield.

                                  RADIO PHRASEOLOGY

A2.1. General. When driving on the CMA, clear and proper communication is vital. Both you
and the air traffic controller must ensure that your communications are understood.
   A2.1.1. Never assume anything.
   A2.1.2. Always ask for assistance if you have any doubt about whether to proceed.
   A2.1.3. If the instructions you receive from the tower controller are unclear, ask that they be
   repeated by stating, ―Say again.‖
   A2.1.4. If there is anything about the instructions you do not understand, ask for further
   explanation.
   A2.1.5. Always repeat or ―read-back‖ your instructions to the tower controller.
A2.2. Radio Communication Procedures.
   A2.2.1. Use a two-way radio capable of communicating with the tower. Normally, airfield
   vehicles are tuned in to the ramp net. Each vehicle must have a unique call sign identifying
   the vehicle. Each unit’s vehicle control officer determines all call signs. An updated call sign
   list will be forwarded to the AFM at least annually.
   A2.2.2. Think about what you are going to say before calling the tower.
   A2.2.3. Know and use proper phraseology. (Refer to the Aviation Phraseology and Aviation
   Alphabet at the end of this section.) Never use Citizen’s Band lingo or law enforcement ―ten‖
   codes.
   A2.2.4. Use the proper sequence in calling the tower. Before you start talking, make sure no
   one else is already talking. Then key your microphone and do the following:
      A2.2.4.1. State whom you are calling and identify yourself by using your vehicle call
      sign. Example: ―Westover Ground, AFLD One.”
      A2.2.4.2. Wait for the tower controller to respond. Be patient, the controller is
      communicating on several nets and maybe busy. When the controller responds, ―AFLD
      One, Westover Ground,‖ state where you are and where you want to go. Example:
      ―AFLD One on Pad 23. Request access onto the active runway.‖ Note: The order in
      which you state where you are and where you want to go is unimportant. You can easily
      state where you want to go and where you are located instead. For example, ―AFLD One
      requests access onto the runway from Pad 23.‖ The important thing to remember is both
      pieces of information are required—where you are and where you’re going.
      A2.2.4.3. Wait for the controller’s response. The controller will either approve or deny
      your request, or give you modified instructions. Example: ―AFLD One, proceed onto the
      runway. Report when off.‖
      A2.2.4.4. Always read back instructions from the tower. Example: ―AFLD One
      proceeding onto the runway. Will report when off.‖ The phrase ―clear‖ shall never be
      used by personnel operating vehicles on the CMA.

        UNIT AIRFIELD DRIVING PROGRAM SELF INSPECTION CHECKLIST

A4.1. General. Surveillance is one of the cornerstones of a strong, viable airfield driving
program. Unit airfield driving program managers will use this guide as a management tool to
determine the status and compliance of their airfield driving program. The assessment should
focus on the program’s integrity, compliance, and support. As a minimum, this guide will be
completed annually or within 30 days of a program manager (primary and/or alternate) change.
Airfield management personnel (OSAA) will use this checklist when inspecting unit airfield
driving programs.

Note: The items listed above are required and will be maintained in the UADPM binder. Airfield
driving program managers are encouraged to use all available resources to make Westover ARB
airfield the safest in AFRC and in the Air Force. For example, although not required, it is
recommended the program manager ask as many questions as he/she feels necessary to ensure the
individual truly knows/understands the layout of the airfield and driving procedures. Airfield
management personnel may ask verbal questions prior to issuing AF Form 483 and could, at their
discretion, deny issuing this form if they feel the individual is not ready to drive on the airfield.
