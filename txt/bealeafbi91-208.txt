Safety Standards. This instruction outlines the procedures and assigns the responsibilities
ensuring positive actions exist to reduce the hazards to personnel and resources during the
parking and loading/unloading of explosives loaded aircraft. It outlines procedures for
conducting field training exercises where explosives are used. It applies to all 9 RW, associate,
deploying, reserve units conducting such activities on Beale AFB and 9 RW personnel involved
in such activities on the installation. This instruction applies to 9th Reconnaissance Wing (9
RW), 9th Support Division (SDS), 9th Maintenance Group (MXG), Beale Command Post
(BCP), 9 RW Safety (SE), 9 RW Public Affairs (PA), 9th Operations Support Squadron Airfield
Management (OSA, OSAA) and 9th Security Forces (SFS) (SFOL). Refer recommended
changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility using the

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This is reserved for summary of changes
 2                                                                BAFBI91-208 6 December 2010


1. Definitions
     1.1. Aircraft Explosives Cargo Parking Area. Any area, commonly called a hot cargo pad
     (HCP), specifically designated for parking aircraft loaded with transportation-configured
     explosives cargo, or those being loaded, unloaded, or awaiting loading. Beale AFB aircraft
     explosives cargo parking area is designated as HCP#1 on taxiway F and the Combat Aircraft
     Parking Area (CAPA1); see Attachment 3 Maps and the 9 RW Master Aircraft Parking Plan.
     1.2. Combat Aircraft Parking Area (CAPA). Any area specifically designated for parking
     aircraft loaded with combat configured explosives, or those being loaded, unloaded or
     awaiting loading.
        1.2.1. Beale AFB combat aircraft parking area is designated as Taxiway M, located at
        the north end of the airfield adjacent to the “hammerhead”; See Attachment 3 Maps and
        the 9 RW Master Aircraft Parking Plan.
     1.3. Quantity-Distance (QD).The quantity of explosive material and distance separation
     relationships that provide defined levels of protection. The relationships are based on levels
     of risk considered acceptable for specific exposures and are tabulated in applicable QD
     tables. These separation distances do not provide absolute safety or protection. Greater
     distances than those in the QD tables should be used if practical.
     1.4. Explosives-Loaded Aircraft. An aircraft is considered “Explosives-Loaded” when it
     carries munitions or explosives, internally or externally, including nuclear weapons in
     accordance with (IAW) T.O. 11A-1-33 and AFMAN 91-201.
     1.5. Non-explosives Loaded Aircraft. An aircraft is not considered explosives-loaded for
     maintenance purposes when the following munitions and/or explosives items are installed
     (IAW T.O. 11A-1-33):
        1.5.1. Egress system components including crew module escape systems.
        1.5.2. Authorized signals and flares stored in aircraft survival kits.
        1.5.3. Pyrotechnics kept in securely mounted protective containers that are a normal
        complement of regularly authorized aircraft equipment used by aircraft crew in an
        emergency for their survival/rescue.
        1.5.4. Pilotless aircraft or drone recovery system explosive components.
        1.5.5. Destructors installed in sensitive electronic equipment or instrumentation.
        1.5.6. Fire extinguisher cartridges.
        1.5.7. Engine starter cartridges.
        1.5.8. Small arms ammunition designated for crew use for their survival/rescue.
        1.5.9. Explosive items of Class 1, Division 4 whose removal requires considerable
        disassembly and whose retention has been authorized by the MAJCOM.
        1.5.10. Inert training munitions.
     1.6. Net Explosive Weight for QD (NEWQD).The total quantity, expressed in pounds
     [kilograms], of high explosives equivalency in each item or round to be used when applying
     QD criteria or other standards. The NEWQD is equal to the NEW unless hazard
BAFBI91-208 6 December 2010                                                                    3


  classification testing has shown that a lower weight is appropriate for QD purposes. (Note: If
  the NEWQD is less than the NEW, the reason is usually that propellant or other substances
  do not contribute as much to the blast effect as the same amount of high explosive would.)
  1.7. Explosive Site Plan (ESP). Package consisting of all information necessary to assess
  compliance with explosives safety standards (especially quantity-distance standards) for
  explosives storage or operating location. Once approved, this package identifies storage and
  operational limitations, and provides a tool for management of risks associated with the
  storage or operating location. Note: An ESP can also be prepared for a non-explosives
  exposed site.
  1.8. Explosives Sited Combat Aircraft Parking Area. An aircraft parking area meeting both
  explosives safety and airfield criteria. Also review the 9 RW Master Aircraft Parking Plan for
  any changes.
  1.9. Potential Explosion Site (PES). The location of a quantity of Ammunition and
  Explosives AE) that will create a blast, fragment, thermal, or debris hazard in the event of an
  accidental explosion of its contents.
  1.10. Exposed Site (ES). Any permanent structure, utility, POL, at risk from either blast or
  fire effects of a Potential Explosion Site (PES). An ES may or may not contain AE.
  1.11. Electro-Explosive Device (EED). An explosive or pyrotechnic component that
  initiates an explosive, burning, electrical, or mechanical train and is activated by the
  application of electrical energy.
  1.11.1. WARNING: All cellular phones, pagers and radios will remain 25 feet from the
  aircraft that has explosive-loaded to prevent injury to personnel and or damage to aircraft.
  1.12. Flight line Munitions Holding Area (FLMHA). A designated area where munitions and
  components are temporarily positioned awaiting transfer to aircraft. Examples are Ready
  Service Igloo, Ready Service Magazine, Ready Service Module, Standard Air Munitions
  Package (STAMP) marshalling area, and Aerial Port of Embarkation (APOE) marshalling
  area.
     1.12.1. There is one FLMHA and is located on the alert pad (AL) between spots AL5
     and AL6,(see Attachment 3) for storage of ammunition and explosives that are palletized
     and ready to be shipped to the Hot Cargo Pad or back to the Munitions Storage Area
     (MSA).
     1.12.2. The FLMHA size is 40 feet by 90 feet; see Attachment 3 Maps for location.
     1.12.3. Munitions owning organizations are responsible for the security of their
     palletized munitions; at least one person will remain with the munitions with a radio for
     emergencies. Radios, cellular phones and pagers will not be closer than 25 feet to any
     palletized munitions.
  1.13. Hazard Classification. Process by which hazardous materials are assigned to one of the
  nine U.N. recognized classes of dangerous goods.
  1.14. Hazard Division (HD). One of six divisions designating the predominant hazard within
  UN Class 1, Explosives (examples: HC/D 1.1, 1.2.1, 1.3, 1.4. 1.5 and 1.6).
 4                                                              BAFBI91-208 6 December 2010
