                                       INTRODUCTION

The National Weather Service (NWS) is responsible for all weather observations in the United
States. DoD organizational elements within the U.S. Air Force (Air Force Weather), Marine
Corps, and Navy take aviation weather reports to support DoD operations. The responsibility for
taking certain observations is delegated to qualified Air Force observers.

This guide has been prepared in conjunction with the Air Force Weather Agency and the Air
Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA).


                             STUDY THIS GUIDE CAREFULLY


OBJECTIVE

Upon completion of this guide, you will have gained the knowledge necessary to complete the
Tower Visibility Examination.

INSTRUCTIONS

The instructions that follow outline the method for using this study guide. Complete the guide in
accordance with these instructions; anything less will reduce its effectiveness and lessen the
possibility of you attaining a passing score on the examination.

Information from the Air Force Manual 15-111, (Surface Weather Observations) and Federal
Meteorological Handbook No. 1 (FMH-1) are necessary for you to perform limited tower
visibility observations and have been included in this publication. No reference material is
needed.

This guide is divided into three chapters:

Chapter 1. – Visibility
Chapter 2. – Reporting Procedures
Chapter 3. – Remarks

Each section includes study assignments followed by written exercises. The correct answers can
be found at the end of this guide.

Trainer:

Provide the trainee with the AFMAN and FMH-1 listed above for training and for daily use.


                                                5
As the trainee goes through training, point out important parts that are of primary interest to your
local situation.

Allow the trainee to spend time working the practice exercises in this guide. In addition, have
them use the AFMAN and FMH-1 to look at real world observations and compare their visibility
readings.

After the trainee has completed the exercises, review all areas concerning visibility reporting,
remarks, and visibility readings prior to giving them the Tower Visibility Examination.

Trainee:

You will be given the opportunity to practice each section of this guide as you progress.

You are the eyes and ears of all visibility information passed to aircrews. Take this training
serious and learn how to properly and efficiently determine and disseminate the information you
will be passing to aircrews. The pilot is interested in what is happening or forecasted to occur at
the point of takeoff or landing. Learn this information so you can give the best information
possible.

                                           VISIBILITY

Visibility is of great importance to pilots when landing or departing. Low visibility affects
airport operations and will influence decisions made by pilots and controllers.

Federal Aviation Regulations establish minimum visibility values under which certain aircraft
operations may be curtailed. Since those engaged in aircraft operations or in providing aviation
services are concerned with or affected by visibility, you can readily appreciate that it is one of
the more important elements of an aviation weather observation.

Visibility is defined in AFI 15-111, paragraph 6.2.1. as: The greatest distance at which selected
objects can be seen and identified.

There are several categories and types of visibility. Each has a technical meaning in a weather
observation and a specified reporting procedure. Because of its importance, visibility is included
in almost every aviation weather observation.

Since visibility observations are made so frequently, especially in periods of marginal weather
conditions when the workload of other primary duties also increases, you should be so familiar
with the procedure for determining and reporting visibility that it is second nature.

To begin, let’s determine how visibility values are observed, measured, and reported. At
Continental United States (CONUS) land stations, visibility is always reported in statute miles
using standard reportable values that are either a whole value or fraction (i.e. ¾ mile, 1 ½ mile,
or 2 miles). At overseas locations, visibility is reported in meters.

Visibility markers are used to determine the distance and reportable value that will be reported
for visibility. Visibility markers are dark or nearly dark objects, e.g., buildings, hangars, etc.,
viewed against the horizon sky during the day-time, or unfocused lights of moderate intensity
during the nighttime.

Markers of the type described above should be used for determining visibility. TV or radio tower
obstruction lights, etc., may be used as nighttime markers. Because of their intensity, focused
lights such as ramp lights, high intensity runway lights, or auto headlights may not be used as
markers. The degree of brilliance of focused lights may be used as an aid to estimate whether
the visibility is greater or less than the distance to the light source.

Complete the following exercise.




                                                  7
                                  VISIBILITY - EXERCISE 1

1. Dark or nearly dark objects against the horizon sky are suitable visibility markers for
__________ and unfocused lights of moderate intensity are suitable for __________ use.
(day/night)                                                                (day/night)

2. Lights most suitable for nighttime markers are ________________.

A. focused colored lights.
B. TV tower obstruction lights.
C. runway lights.

3. Visibility is defined as _______________.

A. the greatest distance you can see objects.
B. the greatest distance objects can be identified.
C. the greatest distance selected objects are seen and identified.
D. none of the above.

See Attachment 3 for answers to the practice exercises.

                          VISIBILITY MARKERS AND VALUES

When a tower controller makes limited visibility observations, there must be current visibility
charts to determine both day and night markers, and the distance (meters or miles) to them. In
many cases, panoramic photographs are used to supplement the visibility chart. A facility should
have charts for day and night observations. Below you will find a two dimensional sample of a
visibility chart depicting daytime and nighttime visibility markers.

Figure 1. Day and Nighttime Marker

DAYTIME




                                               9
On the following page are sample day and night panoramic visibility checkpoint photos. The
photos indicate locations of suitable markers depicted by numbers with corresponding distances
depicted on the side chart. Remember, visibility markers are dark or nearly dark objects, e.g.,
buildings, hangars, etc., viewed against the horizon sky during the day-time, or unfocused lights
of moderate intensity during the nighttime.

These visibility photos or charts should be easily accessible for quick reference. Remember, the
more you use them, the better you will become at determining prevailing visibility and the safer
the airport environment will be.

The table below is taken from AFI 15-111, table 6.2., In this table you will find the values used
to report visibility in bold print. Remember, they are reported in fractions and statute miles at
US locations. The chart depicts reportable values in statute miles and the conversion in meters.
The chart is read from top to bottom. e.g. Visibility can be reported as 1/16, 5/8, 1 1/8, or 2 ½
but not 1 1/16, 2 1/8, or 3 ½ because they are not reportable values.

                   VISIBILITY MARKERS AND VALUES - EXERCISE 2

1. A facility may have separate charts for daytime and nighttime observations.

A. True
B. False

2. Visibility at land stations is always reported in ____________ miles and/or ____________.

3. Fill in the blanks. Visibility values are reported in increments of

1/16 from ____ to ____ mile(s).
1/8 from ____ to ____ mile(s).
1 from ____ to ____ mile(s).
5 above ____ to ____ mile(s).

4. When the determined visibility is halfway between two reportable values, the ________ value
will be reported.                                                             (lower/higher)

5. The visibility is determined to be 2 3/4 miles. The reportable value is __________.

See Attachment 3 for answers to the practice exercises.




                                                 15
                                      VISIBILITY VALUES

To determine the visibility value, use all available markers and determine the greatest distances
that can be seen in all directions around the horizon circle. If the markers are visible with sharp
outlines and little blurring of color, the visibility is much greater than the distance to the markers.
If you can just see and identify a marker, visibility in the direction of the marker is about the
same as distance to the marker. In either case, estimate the distance you can see and report this
value as the visibility. Base your estimate on the appearance of the markers.

For example: The most distant marker is located at 15 miles. Using the 15-mile marker as an
aid, you estimate the visibility to be 25 miles, report 25 miles.

Regardless of how you determine visibility, always round the observed visibility value to the
nearest reportable value. For reportable values refer to Table 1 or AFMAN 15-111.

2. A visibility marker is visible at 3 miles; it is estimated the visibility is at 6 miles. This would
be reported as:

A. 1 1/2
B. 3
C. 5
D. 6

See Attachment 3 for answers to the practice exercises.




                                                  17
                                  VISIBILITY CATEGORIES

As mentioned before, there are several categories of visibility. In this exercise, you will learn
how to determine Prevailing and Sector Visibilities.

Prevailing Visibility is defined as: The greatest visibility equaled or exceeded throughout at least
half of the horizon circle, which need not necessarily be continuous.

Prevailing Visibility Determination

We arrive at the prevailing visibility under conditions of uniform, non-uniform, and variable
visibility.

When conducting a prevailing visibility observation, begin with the highest visibility value and
proceed in descending order until arriving at the greatest visibility equaled or exceeded
throughout at least half the horizon circle, which need not necessarily be continuous. By
creating a chart, and filling in the visibility value and the degree/amount of the horizon until at
least 180 degrees is achieved, makes taking prevailing visibility reading a breeze. See chart
below.




                                                 18
Table 1. Prevailing Visibility Chart example

Visibility    Degrees       In this instance prevailing visibility is 2 miles.
 3 miles      60̊
2.5 miles     45̊
2 miles       75̊
1.5 miles     75̊
1.25 miles    105̊

Uniform Visibility

When the visibility is the same in all sectors, the prevailing visibility is simply the greatest
distance you can see.

Non-uniform Visibility

When the visibility is not the same in all sectors, visually divide the horizon into sectors of
uniform values. The prevailing visibility will be the greatest value that is equaled or exceeded in
sufficient sectors to comprise at least half the horizon circle. For example, if visibility in equal
quarters around the horizon is 4 miles, 3 miles, 1.5 miles, and 1 mile then the prevailing visibility

                                      SECTOR VISIBILITY

Sector visibility is defined in AFI 15-111, paragraph 6.2.4. as: the visibility in a specified
direction that represents a 45-degree arc (portion) of the horizon circle.

Sector visibility is reported in the remarks of an observation if the visibility in that sector differs
from the prevailing visibility, by a reportable value less than 3 miles (4800 meters) or otherwise
considered operationally significant.

When visibility is not uniform in all directions, determine sector visibility by dividing the
horizon circle into sectors of approximate uniform visibility. For example, the figure below
shows a sector visibility of 2 miles in the NNE sector and 1 mile in the NW sector.

Figure 8. Prevailing Visibility Example

                                   NNE – 2
                                   ENE – 4

                                  Variable Prevailing Visibility

When the prevailing visibility is variable (i.e., visibility rapidly increases and decreases by at
least ½ mile during the period of observation and the prevailing visibility is less than 3 miles),
use the average of all observed values as the reported prevailing visibility.

                                 Reporting a Variable Condition

When the prevailing visibility is less than 3 miles and rapidly increases and decreases by at least
½ mile, suffix the average of all observed values with a “V” (for variable), e.g. 2 V. The highest
and lowest values will be reported in the Remarks Column separated by a “V” (e.g. VIS 1 1/2 V
2 1/2).

Example:

During the period of observation, you determine the prevailing visibility to be rapidly increasing
and decreasing between 1 1/2 and 2 miles. The prevailing visibility would be reported as 1 3/4
and the limits of the variation would be shown in the remarks column as VIS 1 1/2V2.

                                  REPORTING PROCEDURES

During periods of critical visibility, the controller’s responsibility is to report significant changes
and be prepared at all times to provide the weather observer with current visibility readings for
incorporation into any recorded report.

Under certain conditions, many stations observe visibility at more than one location.
Surface visibility is determined from the usual point of observation and is reported at nearly
every station.

Tower visibility is determined from the control tower level when the surface visibility is
determined from another location, e.g., the weather station.

                   CONTROL TOWER OBSERVATIONS AND ACTIONS

Tower personnel certified to take limited visibility observations shall notify the weather observer
when observed tower prevailing visibility decreases to less than 4 miles, increase to 4 miles or
more, or is different from the surface prevailing visibility. When prevailing visibility at the usual
point of observation, or at the tower level, is less than 4 miles, tower personnel shall take
prevailing visibility observations.

Use the lower of the two observations (tower or surface) for aircraft operations in
accordance with FAAO JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control, paragraph 2-6-6.

2. On the aviation weather sequence, you see the visibility reported as 15 miles but from the
tower you determine the prevailing visibility to be 3 miles. Do you, as the tower visibility
observer have to report the tower visibility?

a. Yes
b. No

3. Surface visibility is defined as the visibility determined from ________________.

a. the tower
b. the usual point of observation
c. any point of observation
d. the surface

                                   SPECIAL OBSERVATION

Changes in conditions, which are significant from the standpoint of safety and efficiency,
frequently occur between regularly scheduled observations. These changes require the weather
observer to take special observations, often identified as a SPECI.

According to AFMAN 15-111, Space and Weather Observations, criteria requiring special
observations are divided into 14 categories. As a tower controller and visibility observer, you
will be concerned with only one category, prevailing visibility.

When a visibility criterion occurs, you shall take the tower prevailing visibility and report this
value to the weather service.

Special observations are taken, recorded, and disseminated when prevailing visibility decreases
to less than, or if below, increases to equal or exceed any of the following critical values:
(MEMORIZE THEM).

3 miles (4800 meters)
2 miles (3200 meters)
1 mile (1600 meters)

All published instrument approach procedure minima applicable for the airport. MAJCOMs may
add visibility special criteria with MAJCOM requirements.

All published airfield takeoff minima.

Remember: If the visibility is decreasing, it must drop below one of the values listed above. If
the visibility is increasing, it must increase to equal or exceed one of the values.

Examples

A. The ILS minimum is 1/2 mile. The visibility was “0” but it has increased to 1/2 mile. A
special observation is required.

B. The visibility was 4 miles but decreased to 3 miles. A special observation is not required
because the visibility did not decrease to less than 3 miles.

C. The visibility was 1 3/4 miles. It has now increased to 2 miles. A special observation is
required because the visibility increased to equal 2 miles.

                                           REMARKS

There are times when the complete visibility picture cannot be furnished in the body of a
visibility report. When this occurs, a more complete picture is covered in the REMARKS
COLUMN and according to FAAO JO 7110.65, “other pertinent remarks included in the official
weather observation” shall be included in the ATIS broadcast. Because the remarks column
gives a broader weather picture, it becomes a very important part of the weather sequence and
should be issued as required. The local facility Operating Instructions often provide a more
detailed description of what is required.

Sector visibility is included in the remarks column when the prevailing visibility is determined
under non-uniform conditions and the sector visibility differs from the prevailing visibility, and
is less than 3 miles, or is operationally significant.

In the remarks column, the contraction “VIS” is to be followed by sector visibilities, beginning
with north and continuing clockwise.

EXAMPLE: If the visibility by equal sectors is N-2, E-4, S-1, W-2 1/2, the prevailing is reported
as 2 ½ miles and in the remarks column: VIS N2 S1.

                                     VARIABLE VISIBILITY

Variable visibility is reported in the remarks column only when the prevailing visibility is
variable and is less than 3 miles.

To report this condition, the letter “V” is suffixed to the prevailing visibility in the body of the
sequence. In the remarks column, the word “VIS” is followed by the limits of the variability
separated by a “V”.

EXAMPLE: The prevailing visibility is 1 mile and variable. The range of variability is 1/2 mile
to 1 ½ miles. This would be reported as: 1V and a remark “VIS 1/2V1 1/2”.
