This instruction implements AFPD 25-2, Support Agreements, dated 01 November 2001, by
detailing support agreements procedures within the Air Force. DoDI 4000.19 governs
Interservice and Intragovernmental Support. The financial management aspects of Air Force
Support are covered in AFI 65-601. Support to civilian authorities is covered in AFI 10-802. Air
Force and DoD Policy directs that support agreements be developed between suppliers and
receivers within the affected organizations to document recurring day-to-day peacetime support
in order to provide unit commanders with the capability to ensure resources are expended wisely
and to help eliminate unnecessary resource duplication. This instruction does not cover
international agreements or the administration of contracts. Ensure that all records created as a
result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-
123, Management of Records and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://webrims.amc.af.mil/.

(AFISRA) AFI 25-201 dated 1 May 2005 is supplemented as follows. This supplement
establishes procedures for Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR)
Agency (AFISRA) units and identifies the responsibilities of AFI 25-201, Support Agreements
Procedures. This supplement clarifies roles and responsibilities for AFISRA/A4R, Wing/Center
Support Agreement Manager (SAM), along with the establishment of the Agreement Point of
Contact (APOC) at AFISRA’s Direct Reporting Units (DRUs), Group level and below. This
supplement provides extensive guidance on the management of Memorandums of
Agreement/Understanding (MOA/MOUs). This supplement applies to AFISRA Wings, Centers
and DRUs (e.g., 361st ISR Group (ISRG)). This supplement also applies to AFISRA-gained Air
National Guard and Air Force Reserve units. This supplement does not apply to Service Level
Agreements which are covered in AFI 33-115 Volume 1, Network Operations (NETOPS). All
AFISRA Wings, Centers and DRUs will up-channel support agreement issues/problems to
AFISRA/A4R for appropriate action. Refer recommended changes and questions about this
publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847,

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision revises and/or clarifies Civil Engineering (CE), Security Forces (SF) and Staff
Judge Advocate (SJA) reviews during Support Agreement (SA) routing. It identifies early
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance. It authorizes electronic and digital
signatures as an approved method to sign agreements and eliminates the triennial review
requirement. A bar ( | ) indicates a revision from the previous edition.

                                           Chapter 1

                 AGREEMENTS—PURPOSE, TYPE, AND AUTHORITY

1.1. Support Agreements Covered by DD Form 1144.
   1.1.1. Support agreements administered by the Air Force are normally documented on DD
   Form
   1144 fall into the following principal categories:
   Air Force to Air Force, known as Intraservice Agreements (to include Air Force Reserve
   Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG)).
   Air Force to other Service or DoD components, known as Interservice Agreements.
   Air Force to other non-DoD Federal activities, known as Intragovernmental Agreements.
   Air Force to other non-Federal activities, excluding private or commercial enterprises.
   1.1.2. To ensure the maintenance of a comprehensive logistics record, all significant
   recurring support provided by the Air Force shall be recorded on DD Form 1144, whether
   reimbursable or non-reimbursable. Also, record all such support on DD Form 1144 when the
   Air Force is the receiver.
   1.1.3. Policy and procedures for Interservice, Intragovernmental and Air Force to non-
   Federal activities are governed by the DoDI 4000.19. In addition, the DoDI 4000.19 provides
   general guidance for the administration of support agreements within the DoD community.
   1.1.4. Conflict with Other Guidance. Information in agreements will not supersede any other
   DoD or Air Force directive or instruction that has instructional details of functional area
   support. The agreement itself should not prescribe detailed procedures for performing any
   particular support function. Such guidance is usually in other DoD or Air Force directives,
   instructions, manuals, etc., which apply to the particular type of support being performed.
   See Attachment 6 for examples. If such information is not in the DoD or Air Force directive
   in enough detail for local use, a local-level operational procedure/directive should be
   prepared and referenced in the agreement.
1.2. Memorandums of Agreement/Understanding (MOA/MOUs).
   1.2.1. Most MOAs and MOUs are used to define areas of broad agreement between two or
   more parties. MOAs are memorandums that define general areas of conditional agreement
   between two or more parties – the actions of the other party depend on what the other party
   does (e.g., one party agrees to provide support if the other party provides the materials).
   MOUs are memorandums that define general areas of understanding between two or more
   parties – explains what each party plans to do; however, what each party does is not
   dependent on the actions of the other party (e.g., does not require reimbursement or other
   support from receiver).
   1.2.2. MAJCOM/Numbered Air Force (NAF) Level MOA/MOUs. Most internal Air Force
   MOA/ MOUs are broad agreements between or among MAJCOMs or NAFs to identify
   parameters for developing support agreements between subordinate units. At the installation
6                                                   AFI25-201_AFISRASUP_I 10 APRIL 2012


    level, these MOA/MOUs are then used as a source document in addressing the provision of
    services, funding and reimbursement arrangements. However, the actual transfer of funds or
    other resources is effected by the relevant established functional procedure and not by
    MOA/MOUs alone.
    1.2.3. Functional Area MOA/MOUs. MOA/MOUs can be used between functional areas to
    docu-ment mutually agreed areas of responsibility, such as:
               • Statement of facts.
               • Intentions.
               • Procedures.
               • Policies for future actions.
    The functional Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) (e.g. Civil Engineers, Security
    Forces) will usually draft, sign and maintain these documents, which are procedural or
    technical in nature and will not initiate the obligation of funds or manpower for recurring
    support.
    1.2.4. (Added-AFISRA) Agreements are not required between AFISRA units. However,
    when roles and responsibilities require delineation, agency units should consider using
    operating instructions or supplements. Note: Any agreement involving Air National Guard
    units will be sent to NGB/A4 for coordination.
       1.2.4.1. (Added-AFISRA) MOA/MOU signatory/approval authority. The AFISRA
       Commander or designated representative, will sign Agency/MAJCOM level
       MOAs/MOUs. MAJCOM level agreements initiated by Wings/Centers will be forwarded
       to AFISRA/A4R for headquarters staff coordination and Commander/Approving Official
       signature. Wing/Center/DRU commanders are the approval authority for MOAs/MOUs
       with units of an equivalent level. Wing/Center/DRU commanders may delegate approval
       authority, in writing, to their subordinate commanders/directors. Note: MOAs/MOUs
       with non-DOD federal equivalent organizations may require HHQ coordination. Contact
       AFISRA/A4R for appropriate guidance.
    1.2.5. (Added-AFISRA) MOA/MOU Process.
       1.2.5.1. (Added-AFISRA) The functional office of primary responsibility (OPR) will
       contact their assigned SAM or APOC and inform them of the requirement for an
       agreement. The SAM/APOC will provide guidance to the OPR, who is responsible for
       writing the MOA/MOU.
       1.2.5.2. (Added-AFISRA) The OPR will coordinate the draft agreement with
       appropriate action officers to clarify the purpose and delineate responsibilities. After
       action officer review and revisions have been made to the draft agreement, the OPR will
       follow SAM/APOC direction and associated standard protocol within their Wing, Center,
       or DRU to complete 3-digit and 2-digit coordination. All coordination responses will be
       maintained in the agreement folder.
       1.2.5.3. (Added-AFISRA) The OPR will resolve all issues and prepare the draft
       agreement for final review by their assigned SAM/APOC. The SAM/APOC will assist
       the OPR in preparing the package for final coordination and approval.
AFI25-201_AFISRASUP_I 10 APRIL 2012                                                           7


      1.2.5.4. (Added-AFISRA) MOAs/MOUs to be signed by the Wing/Center/DRU
      commander will be forwarded to AFISRA/A4R for bottom line coordination. After
      Agency staff review, all comments and/or recommendations will be returned to the
      Wing/Center/DRU for appropriate action to consummate the agreement. MOAs/MOUs
      to be signed by the Group commander, and below, will be forwarded to their HHQ SAM
      for bottom line coordination. After HHQ review, all comments and/or recommendations
      will be returned to that unit SAM/APOC for appropriate action to consummate the
      agreement.
      1.2.5.5. (Added-AFISRA) MOA/MOUs           initiated    by     Wings/Centers     for
      Agency/MAJCOM level signature will be forwarded to AFISRA/A4R. AFISRA/A4R
      will coordinate the document within the headquarters staff, obtain the
      Commander/Approving Official signature, and return signed agreement package to SAM.
      Note: Any agreement involving Air National Guard units will be sent to NGB/A4 for
      coordination.
      1.2.5.6. (Added-AFISRA) The SAM will ensure the appropriate parties receive a copy
      of the signed agreement.
      1.2.5.7. (Added-AFISRA) The SAM will ensure MOAs/MOUs are reviewed IAW
      terms of the agreement. Agreements will also be reviewed when there is a mission
      change to ensure accuracy of the agreement. Note: Unless there are special
      requirements that mandate annual reviews, the MOA/MOU review frequency will be set
      at a minimum of three years but no more than every five years.
1.3. Major Range and Test Facility Bases.
   1.3.1. DoDD 3200.11, Major Range and Test Facility Base, covers certain specialized range
   documentation. However, base support provided to range users should still be covered by a
   standard support agreement.
1.4. Support That Does Not Fall Under DoDI 4000.19 or This Instruction.
   1.4.1. Support to DoD contractors. If base support is required beyond what is identified in a
   Request for Proposal (RFP) or contract, the offerer or contractor formally requests the
   specified base support be incorporated into the RFP or contract. The request is submitted to
   the Contracting Officer who issued the contract or RFP. If the Contracting Officer agrees to
   the request, then it is documented in a contract not a support agreement. MOAs, MOUs or
   Support Agreements will not be used to amend or change contracts.
   1.4.2. Agreements In Lieu of War or Contingency Plans. Support agreements are not a
   suitable means to document support for war, Operations Other Than War (OOTW) or
   exercise requirements, which should be documented in the appropriate plan (e.g.
   support/operational/ deployment plans).
   1.4.3. Does not apply to agreements covering grants, international agreements, commercial
   activities, or acquisitions under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).

    which would violate AFI 25-201, IC paragraph 2.7.3, the National Environmental Policy Act
    (NEPA) or EIAP.
    2.7.3. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969
        2.7.3.1. Compliance with NEPA is an integral part of basing. Prior to making a final
        decision, NEPA’s implementing regulations prohibit the commitment of resources which
        will prejudice the selection of alternatives, and also prohibit taking any action which
        would have an adverse impact on the environment or limit the choice of reasonable
        alternatives.
        2.7.3.2. Prior to basing at an installation that would be the subject of a request for
        support agreement, the proponent of the action (i.e., proposed tenant) is responsible for
        evaluating a full range of reasonable alternatives consistent with NEPA, the President’s
        Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Regulations for Implementing the Procedural
        Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR §§1500-1508), and the Air Force’s EIAP, 32 CFR 989.
        2.7.3.3. When a non-Air Force proponent wants to use an Air Force installation (or
        portions thereof) for their own proposed action, the EIAP regulation at 32 CFR 989.7,
        Request from non-Air Force agencies of entities (among others) must be followed.
2.8.   Installation Security Forces (SF).
    2.8.1. SF will conduct all required reviews, focused on security concerns (force protection,
    resource protection, weapon system security, information security, industrial security,
    weapon storage, law enforcement and related security services) and will coordinate on the
    SA during the initial review cycle. Additional reviews are only required if issues (security
    concerns) arise during the review process. The review of SA will be completed by the SF
    FAAC. An additional signature from the Security Forces Squadron Commander (or
    Commander designate) is not required on the DD Form 1144.
2.9.   Installation Staff Judge Advocate (SJA).

                                          Chapter 3

                           SEEKING SUPPORT AND WAIVERS

3.1. Seeking Support.
   3.1.1. Circumstances which may cause commanders to seek support include:
      3.1.1.1. Additions to existing role or mission.
      3.1.1.2. Unplanned loss of an existing source of support (e.g. natural disaster).
      3.1.1.3. Similar or identical functions being duplicated by nearby DoD components or
      other federal agencies.
      3.1.1.4. Improved economy or efficiency of operation.
      3.1.1.5. The closest Air Force installation to an Air Force GSU should provide base
      support, regardless of parent MAJCOM.
      3.1.1.6. Consolidation of functions.
      3.1.1.7. Base Realignment and Closure.
      3.1.1.8. AFELMs, which need Air Force-unique support, that non-Air Force suppliers
      cannot provide (e.g. Military Personnel Flight Services, USAF unique uniform)
3.2. Development of Support Agreements.
   3.2.1. Air Force organizations will develop support agreements with receivers of that
   support. The following general rules apply:
      3.2.1.1. An agreement should normally cover only one receiver, but more than one
      receiver can be included if they are funded from the same source as long as the funding
      source, as identified in Block 11c, is the same.
      3.2.1.2. Separate agreements are required for each different supplier.
      3.2.1.3. If two organizations both supply and receive support to and from each other,
      then separate agreements should be developed.
      3.2.1.4. Air Force organizations should provide support to other Air Force or DoD
      organizations when requested, subject to the commander’s determination that the
      organization has the capability to do so without jeopardizing assigned missions.
      3.2.1.5. The support provided to receivers should be equivalent to the standard level of
      support defined and furnished by the supplier to its own mission, unless otherwise
      requested or agreed to by the receiver.
      3.2.1.6. The provision of small-scale recurring support may not always justify the
      administrative effort and expense of preparing a full support agreement. In such cases,
      the agreement approving authority may waive the need to prepare a formal agreement but
      SAMs should still retain a written record of details to ensure continuity for the
      arrangement.

   3.2.2. MAJCOMs need to ensure the AFRC and the ANG receive the same level of support
   as other Air Force tenant organizations on their installations. This includes but is not limited
   to:
      3.2.2.1. Base level support services
      3.2.2.2. Annual tours
      3.2.2.3. Unit training assemblies
      3.2.2.4. Peacetime training in all areas
      3.2.2.5. Weekend operations
3.3. Waivers to Support.
   3.3.1. Requests for a waiver to permit duplication of support functions are appropriate if:
      3.3.1.1. It is more economical
      3.3.1.2. Provision of support is physically impractical
      3.3.1.3. Wartime requirements dictate duplication of facilities or functions
   3.3.2. ANG and AFRC receivers do not require a duplication waiver if their requirement is
   based on a wartime mission of their gaining MAJCOM.
   3.3.3. To obtain a waiver, the receiving MAJCOM should send a waiver request to the
   supplying MAJCOM, including confirmation of whether or not the receiving MAJCOM
   accepts responsibility for the financial and manpower costs of supporting the waiver. The
   receiving MAJCOM then requests the waiver from HQ USAF/ILGC. If approved, the waiver
   will normally be valid for three years and a copy of it should be attached to the relevant
   support agreement.

             SUPPORT AGREEMENT DOCUMENTATION PROCEDURES

4.1. Identifying the Requirement.
   4.1.1. The potential receiver identifies support requirements to the proposed supplier by
   official correspondence and if possible, sets up a face-to-face meeting to clarify respective
   requirements and capabilities, including mission, equipment types, and personnel. Typical
   questions to be resolved include:
       4.1.1.1. How will the potential receiver request support from the supplier?
       4.1.1.2. Who will receive the support?
       4.1.1.3. What type and level of support will be required?
       4.1.1.4. Are there non-standard conditions related to the request for support?
       4.1.1.5. What is the objective or mission supported?
       4.1.1.6. When will the support be provided?
       4.1.1.7. Have all support categories been considered?
       4.1.1.8. Where will the support be provided?
       4.1.1.9. Does the receiver have any contracts with contractors where the government has
       agreed to provide base support?
       4.1.1.10. Does the receiver have an existing Requirements Contract that precludes
       supplier from providing requested support or duplicate services already provided in the
       contract?
   4.1.2. Any doubts as to exactly what support is needed must be clarified before the support
   agreement is approved.
4.2. Drafting - Support Responsibilities.
   4.2.1. The SAM ensures population, equipment, and aircraft requiring support are identified
   and defined.
   4.2.2. The supplier SAM prepares a draft agreement to identify support, using the support
   category listings found in Enclosure 6 to DoDI 4000.19 and Attachment 5 to this AFI.
   Categories not included in previously cited references must be approved by MAJCOM.
   4.2.3. All affected parties, including the receiver and supplier’s functional areas should
   review and coordinate the draft agreement. SAMs should ensure that their FAACs fully
   understand the implications of the agreement in their respective areas and note that questions
   on the capability to support the receivers are best coordinated directly between FAACs and
   receivers.
   4.2.4. SAMs should ensure that all attachments to support agreements are listed in Block 11
   of the DD Form 1144.
 18                                                AFI25-201_AFISRASUP_I 10 APRIL 2012


   4.2.5. The SAM ensures specific provisions in all support agreements are identified and
   defined.
4.3. Drafting - Financial Responsibilities.
   4.3.1. The local FM assists support providers in identifying what the receiver pays for,
   including its basis and estimated reimbursements, on the DD Form 1144 and its funding
   annex (See Attchment 9 – Support Agreement Reimbursement Matrix).
   4.3.2. FM and DFAS organizations will detail all costs billed to the receiver to include the
   following:
       4.3.2.1. Relevant support categories.
       4.3.2.2. Computation details of the reimbursables.
       4.3.2.3. Frequency of billing (e.g. monthly, quarterly, or annually).
   4.3.3. Interservice and Intragovernmental receivers will normally be charged for direct
   incremental costs only, as per DoDI 4000.19, paragraph 4.6. Reimbursement policy for
   intraservice agreements is covered by AFI 65-601, Volume I.
   4.3.4. Local FM personnel will record all reimbursement computations in sufficient detail to
   provide an audit trail by clearly documenting computation methods, factor sources, and
   results. In addition, the Funding Annex should include sufficient documentation to satisfy the
   financial concerns of the receiver. The Funding Annex must include program element code,
   any statutory limitations applicable to the program element code, funds expiration date for
   obligated purpose, method of reimbursement, method of recording obligations, and name and
   phone number of the originator of the document.
   4.3.5. Reimbursement should be understood to mean the transfer of funds from one agency
   to another, not the exchange of services.
   4.3.6. Note that non-standard rules apply to certain ’Providers of Public Goods or Services’,
   ’Mutual
   Benefits’ and other specific exceptions, as detailed at Attachment 6.
   4.3.7. If current Air Force standard base level accounting systems do not directly correlate
   identification of incurred expenses with the support categories outlined in DoDI 4000.19,
   then estimation of anticipated reimbursements should be based on:
       4.3.7.1. General and specific provisions of the agreement.
       4.3.7.2. Reasonable projections of required levels and amounts of support.
       4.3.7.3. Generally accepted cost analysis techniques and principles.
4.4. Drafting - Manpower and Organization Responsibilities.
   4.4.1. The installation Manpower and Organization Flight identifies required manpower in
   the manpower annex to support the additional workload. (Suggested format in Attachment
   8)
   4.4.2. The manpower annex will detail the following:
       4.4.2.1. Computation method.
AFI25-201_AFISRASUP_I 10 APRIL 2012                                                             19


      4.4.2.2. Man-hour or manpower impact by functional area/support category.
      4.4.2.3. Total manpower impact in whole numbers.
   4.4.3. Current Air Force Functional Account Codes and Air Force Manpower Standards do
   not correlate to support categories in DoDI 4000.19. Manpower impacts will be based on:
      4.4.3.1. Specific provision of the agreement.
      4.4.3.2. Air Force Manpower Standards.
      4.4.3.3. Management engineering methods (technical estimates, good operator timing,
      position manning, operational audits, etc).
   4.4.4. The man-hours required to support the additional workload will be totaled and the
   manpower will be computed using the Man-hour Availability Factor. The Manpower and
   Organization Flight will document and maintain on file all computations in sufficient detail
   to provide an audit trail of required manpower.
   4.4.5. Interservice Support Agreements causing a manpower impact need to be worked
   between the Manpower staffs of Headquarters Air Force and the affected service.
4.5. Contract Provided Support.
   4.5.1. When a receiving unit requests support that is provided to the supplier via a base
   support contract, a formal support agreement is necessary. Base contract support costs are
   reimbursable IAW DoDI 4000.19, paragraph 4.6 and AFI 65-601, Vol. 1, as applicable.
   4.5.2. Each functional category provided by a base contractor will be documented in broad,
   general terms IAW enclosure 6 to DoDI 4000.19, or Attachment 5 to this AFI, or the
   supplier’s support capability catalog.
   4.5.3. Neither specific reference to the supporting contract number nor detailed wording
   contained in the contract will be included.
   4.5.4. Receiving activity requests for changes in support must be routed through the SAM
   and forwarded to the appropriate Point of Contact (POC) for contract impact review.
   Contract modification costs resulting from receiving activity requests are the responsibility of
   the receiving activity.
   4.5.5. To prevent the appearance of impropriety, the contractor will not serve as the FAAC
   for the contractor provided support.

                                           Chapter 5

        SUPPORT AGREEMENT PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES

5.1. Preparing and Revising Agreements.
   5.1.1. When a new agreement, revision, review, waiver, or termination is required, SAMs
   should ensure all relevant functional offices are notified and to this end they must retain POC
   details for all offices involved. An agreements processing flow chart for the process is at
   Figure 5.1.
   5.1.2. When there is a procedural conflict among MAJCOMs, the supplier MAJCOM
   procedures will take precedence, as long as the supplier MAJCOM procedures do not
   significantly impact the receiver’s mission.
5.2. Coordination.
   5.2.1. Coordination guidelines are as follows:
      5.2.1.1. SAMs produce the initial or revised draft of an agreement and then ensure it is
      coordinated in writing by all parties concerned (See Attachment 7).
      5.2.1.2. SAMs staff the agreement to Manpower, Financial Management, the Staff Judge
      Advocate (SJA), the Environmental Planning Function, and Security Forces for
      coordination and DD Form 1144 continuation statements, and signatures, as appropriate.
      However, the JA review will occur after all other coordination comments have been made
      and appropriate changes incorporated. Figure 5.2 shows the manpower review process.
      5.2.1.3. SAMs should check the completed coordination sheets for errors or changes that
      may create an impasse and transfer any amendments into the master draft agreement.
5.3. Approval and Signatures.
   5.3.1. The SAM:
      5.3.1.1. Prepares a letter to transmit a copy of the final draft support agreement to the
      supplier Comptroller for approval signature.
      5.3.1.2. Prepares a letter transmitting the original agreement to receiver. This letter
      should explain any apparent anomalies and their rationale. If receiver requests further
      changes, then renegotiate the disputed issues and, after legal review of any substantive
      changes, have the approving official sign and return the original agreement.
      5.3.1.3. Obtains final approval signature. Insert the date of Supplier Approving Official’s
      signature in Block 3 (effective date) of the DD Form 1144 unless otherwise stated in
      Block 11.
      5.3.1.4. Determines the number of copies required and forwards them to the parties
      concerned.
      5.3.1.5. Consolidates correspondence and coordination that documents significant
      changes, and retains it for the next review cycle.
      5.3.1.6. Use of electronic and digital signatures on SAs. IAW AFI 33-321, paragraph 4,
      Authorization of Air Force Records, a record is authenticated when it contains an official
AFI25-201_AFISRASUP_I 10 APRIL 2012                                                           21


       signature or seal indicating the document is genuine and official. A signature or seal may
       be written, stamped, electronic or digital. The guidance contained in AFI 33-321 now
       applies to all SAs.
5.4. Review and Revision of Support Agreements.
   5.4.1. Annual FM Budget Review.
       5.4.1.1. Ensures continued accuracy of estimated reimbursement charges and coincides
       with budget lead-time requirements and Financial Plan preparation.
       5.4.1.2. Does not involve a renegotiation unless there are significant changes in support
       requirements.
       5.4.1.3. Reviews estimated support requirements prior to the annual budget submission.
       A revised Funding Annex (if required), signed by both supplier and receiver FMs, will
       then be forwarded to the SAM to be included as an attachment to the agreement.

NOTE: There is no need to route the agreement through the final approval authorities. Figure
5.3 shows an Annual Budget Review flow chart of the process.
   5.4.2. Triennial Reviews.
       5.4.2.1. Triennial Reviews of Agreements are eliminated. SA reviews are only required
       when there are significant changes in the requested support.
       5.4.2.2. Delete
       5.4.2.3. Delete
       5.4.2.4. Delete
       5.4.2.5. Delete
       5.4.2.6. Delete
   5.4.3. Minor Revisions. Minor pen and ink changes, including non-substantive
   modifications, may be made by mutual agreement provided they do not significantly affect
   manpower or funds.
5.5. Resolving Impasses.
   5.5.1. As a general rule, impasses should be resolved at the lowest possible level and only
   elevated to higher authority when the local negotiation process is exhausted. The following
   rules apply:
       5.5.1.1. If an impasse concerning an overall agreement cannot be resolved between the
       supplier and receiver within a reasonable amount of time, then both SAMs pass details to
       their MAJCOM counterparts for resolution.
       5.5.1.2. If an impasse relating to a specific support category cannot be resolved at
       installation level then both FAACs pass details to their MAJCOM counterparts for
       resolution with copies to their installation SAMs and MAJCOM support agreement
       program managers. Omit the impasse category of support from the support agreement
       and include the following statement in DD Form 1144, Block 11, and General Provisions
 22                                                AFI25-201_AFISRASUP_I 10 APRIL 2012


      that ―Due to an impasse in negotiating support for category XXXX, this agreement is
      being processed with an impasse.‖
      5.5.1.3. MAJCOMs should advise HQ USAF/ILGC of any formal impasse outstanding
      for more than 180 days.
      5.5.1.4. Upon resolution of an impasse, correspondence documenting the resolution
      process will become part of the agreement file.
   5.5.2. (Added-AFISRA) Impasses. An impasse exists when senior leadership of both
   parties cannot resolve issues relating to the agreement. Units will elevate these issues through
   their chain of command until resolved. The Wing/Center/DRU commander will transfer the
   impasse to AFISRA/A4R via memo when an impasse has been declared. The memo must
   explain the nature of the impasse.
5.6. Reduction, Modification or Termination of Support.
   5.6.1. If an agreement is unilaterally terminated, suspended or significantly modified with
   less than 180 days notice to other parties of the agreement, the unilateral party may be billed
   by affected parties for reimbursement of unavoidable termination or re-procurement expenses
   incurred up to 180 days following the written notification.
   5.6.2. The supplier FAAC will ensure that final charges for support are submitted NLT 90
   days after receipt of notification of termination of support.
   5.6.3. Installation SAMs are to notify HQ USAF/ILGC, through their MAJCOM SAMs,
   prior to the issue of any unilateral termination notice.
5.7. Form Prescribed. DD Form 1144, Support Agreement.

Air Force Element (AFELM)—Identifies Air Force personnel on duty with agencies outside
the Department of the Air Force that are the ―Air Force Element‖ of the agency where they
perform duty. An AFELM is not a constituted unit.
Annual Budget Review—A review, prior to submission of the annual budget submission, when
installation level financial and functional resource managers review the accuracy of
reimbursement charges. This data is used in the computation of future budget requirements.
AFI25-201_AFISRASUP_I 10 APRIL 2012                                                            31


Approval Authority—An individual authorized to commit resources for the supplier/ receiver.
Basis for Reimbursement (block 7.b on DD Form 1144)—A dollar value for a defined unit of
service (e.g., $50 annually per square foot of occupied office space, $50 monthly per assigned

1. If funded by a contract
2. Reimbursable if additional services are satisfied by use of a contract chaplain.
3. Reimbursement for software sharing actions will be based on additional or incremental costs
   incurred.
4. Reimbursable except for common and joint-use communication facilities
5. Reimbursable if additional facilities are required to handle the increase in patronage
6. Unit disaster preparedness supplies, i.e., decontamination material, shelter supplies
7. For fee service provided by Defense Automated Printing Service (DAPS)

8. Non-reimbursable except for unique expense material or when serviced by a contract
9. Tenant funds for off-base facilities whether work is done by the host work force or by
   contract, and on-base minor construction projects with funded cost over $2,000. The tenant
   also typically funds anything beyond this amount, to include actual MILCON. This is because
   the tenant is ostensibly reconfiguring the facility for their unique needs and such efforts are
   above and beyond the standard baseline service everyone else on base receives. The critical
   question to ask is if the building work is to maintain the basic, original integrity of the facility
   or is it unique to the user in that it changes the original form, fit, or function of the facility.
10. Reimbursable for non-active duty – non-reimbursable for active duty
11. Unusual, unique, or inordinate security requirements are reimbursable
12. Equipment and supplies ordered by the tenant are reimbursable
*NOTE: Most interservice or interagency support is reimbursable provided the basis of
reimbursement calculation meets the criteria found in DoDI 4000.19, paragraph 4.6,
Reimbursement.

**NOTE: Policy and methodology for determining reimbursement costs are found in DoD
7000.14-R, Vol. 11A. chap 1.

***NOTE: The tenant is responsible for budgeting and funding for required services provided by
contract as stated in AFI 65-601, Vol I, chap 7, Para 7.5.4.
