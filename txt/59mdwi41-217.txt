This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive 41-2, Medical Support. This instruction
establishes policies and provides instructions on the use of wireless communication devices in
the 59th Medical Wing (MDW). This instruction applies to all personnel assigned, attached, or
under contract to the 59 MDW. This instruction does not apply to the Air National Guard or Air
Force Reserve. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office
of Primary Responsibility using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.
Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Updated cellular phone use.
1. Cellular phones, two-way pagers, walkie-talkies, two-way family radio services (FRS)
walkie-talkies, and wireless personal data assistants (PDA) pose a potential electromagnetic
interference (EMI) risk. The risk is greatest when the devices are operated in high density
electrical equipment areas and/or near patients who are in critical condition and highly dependent
on monitoring or life-support equipment. Recent studies by the Food and Drug Administration
/Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Recommendations for EMC/EMI in Healthcare
Facilities; Emergency Care Research Institute, Cell Phones and Electromagnetic Interference
Revisited; Mayo Clinic Proceedings, Cellular Telephone Interference with Medical Equipment;
and Critical Care, Interference by New-Generation Mobile Phones on Critical Care Medical
Equipment, recommend that with some precautions the risk is minimized and use of these

devices are unlikely to cause interference with medical devices located in patient care areas of
hospitals.
2. Digital and analog cellular phones, two-way beepers, and wireless PDAs are authorized
to be used throughout the facility with the following restrictions.
     2.1. A minimum of 3 feet (1 meter) distance from medical and laboratory equipment must be
     maintained. Note: Cellular phones, when left on, intermittently transmit network signals
     even if no call is in progress.
     2.2. Cellular phone users will use proper telephone etiquette such as placing phones on
     silence or vibrate modes and speaking in a soft voice so as not to disturb patients or visitors.
     2.3. Two-Way Radios. Two-way radios, walkie-talkies and FRS have a higher power output
     than cell phones. As their output easily penetrates walls, floors, and ceilings they present a
     higher risk for equipment interference and are prohibited from transmitting within 25 feet of
     patients connected to medical equipment. However, they may remain in listening mode.
3. The 59 MDW Safety Manager, staff members, and supervisors will enforce this policy
within building 4550. Any incident thought to have been influenced by EMI must be promptly
reported to Biomedical Engineering at 292-5103.
4. Adopted Form. AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.
