             & FRAUD, WASTE, AND ABUSE DISCLOSURE SYSTEM


1. The Air Force IG complaint program strives to ensure a fair and equitable
standard for everyone. You are free to lodge a complaint at any level, and can
do so without fear of intimidation or retribution.

2. The IG Complaint Program is described in AFI 90-301. This document
provides sufficient guidance to aid you in filing your complaint. Typically,
complaints are most efficiently and effectively addressed at the supervisor or
commander level. You are encouraged, but not required, to discuss your
problem with your supervisor or your commander before coming to the IG.

3. Some matters are more appropriately addressed through other channels than
the IG. Anyone considering lodging an IG complaint should closely read AFI
90-301, sections 1J, 1K, 1L, 1M, and review Table 2.5 to ensure the problem             LT COL
is not addressed by other Air Force directives.                                   JOSEPH S. GRANDUCCI
