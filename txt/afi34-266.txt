                                           Chapter 1

                                        OPERATIONS

1.1. Air Force Fitness and Sports Program. The mission of the Air Force Fitness and Sports
Program is to contribute to mission readiness, Comprehensive Airman Fitness (CAF), and
improved productivity by promoting physical fitness, esprit de corps, and quality of life for Air
Force customers. This is done by supporting the Air Force Fitness Program, providing
interactive customer service with equipment and facility orientations, and supporting the World
Class Athlete Program (see Paragraph 2.14.2.). In addition, fitness and sports programs are
offered to all authorized users. Air Force Fitness personnel, programs and facilities greatly
enhance the Air Force's holistic approach of teaching Airmen to adopt healthy lifestyles within
the CAF domains: mental, physical, social and spiritual.
   1.1.1. Refer to AFI 34-101, Air Force Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) Programs
   and Use Eligibility for program participation priorities. Where military facilities are not
   available, use appropriated funds (APF) to contract with specified local facilities (refer to
   AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) and
   Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFIs), Chapter 9 Contracting for Physical
   Fitness Services, for details on who is authorized to contract for commercial fitness services
   and how to obtain approval from the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Cost
   and Economics (SAF/FMC). (T-1)
   1.1.2. Funding. Core fitness and sports programs in Air Force Fitness and Sports Centers
   (FSCs) are Category A activities per DoDD 1308.1; DoDI 1015.10, Military Morale,
   Welfare And Recreation (MWR) Programs. The Air Force goal is 100 percent APF support
   where authorized in Category A activities. Sports programs (above the intramural level) are
   Category B activities. Category B activities should be supported with a minimum of 65
   percent APFs and the remaining with nonappropriated funds (NAFs). Revenue generating
   activities such as vending and resale services are Category C activities. Category C activities
   must function with the use of NAFs only. (T-0) NAF expenditures should be appropriate to
   the number of participants. Effective planning and budgeting are essential to ensure
   successful execution of activities and future projects. Fees and/or charges for fitness classes
   and special events (above the core fitness programs) are authorized only to offset verifiable
   NAF expenses for these services. NAF funds can be used for entry fees, but not for food or
   lodging for varsity sports (see Table 2.3). APFs must be used where authorized. (T-0) The
   Fitness and Sports Manager* (FSM) coordinates with the Chief, Resource Management (i.e.,
   Resource Manager) for expenditures with NAFs from either the installation MWR Fund
   and/or higher HQ NAFs. NOTE: Active duty military managers in charge of a Fitness and
   Sports Center use the duty title of Chief, Fitness and Sports Section (officer) or Section
   Chief, Fitness and Sports (enlisted). However, since most managers are civilian, the civilian
   duty title of FSM will be used throughout the remainder of this document.
   1.1.3. The AF Fitness and Sports Common Operating Levels of Support (COLS) establish a
   single standard for activity operations. The standards ensure a uniform level of service is
   provided to customers and establish mandatory technical and operational specifications for
   all Force Support Squadron (FSS) programs and activities. Compliance with COLS is
 6                                                                AFI34-266 8 DECEMBER 2014


     mandatory and are located at: https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/AFCOLS/Pages/Home.aspx. (T-
     1)
     1.1.4. Additional AF Fitness and Sports standards may be found on the AF Fitness and
     Sports Manager’s website. Compliance with AF Fitness and Sports Standards is mandatory.
     (T-1)
1.2. Fitness and Sports Center (FSC) Hours of Operation. Per DoDI 1015.10, main FSCs
will be open a minimum of 90 staffed hours per week. Waivers to operate below the DoD
standard requires waiver approval from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Personnel
and Readiness (OSD P&R). (T-0) Reserve installations will be open for 70 staffed hours per
week. (T-1) Hours of operation must be displayed within view of customers outside the FSC.
(T-1) Expanding staffed hours beyond the Air Force goal requires resources (manpower and
funding) at the local level. If expanded hours are preferred, consider civilian overhires, NAF
memorandums of agreement (MOA) and Air Reserve Component (ARC) personnel as delivery
methods. Prior to expanding hours of operation, consider the availability of all alternate exercise
avenues (running tracks, bike trails, par course, unit physical training facility (UPTF), etc.).
FSCs will be open federal holidays, unless otherwise directed by the installation commander.
(T-3)
     1.2.1. Fitness Access – Controlled After-Hours Use at Main Operating Base (MOB) Fitness
     Facilities. Unsupervised, after-hours use of FSS primary, additional, satellite, or annex
     fitness facilities at MOBs, by units or individuals, is prohibited except for facilities approved
     to operate in such a manner under the Fitness Access initiative. (T-0) Fitness Access
     provides facility access for installations with a high number of military shift workers to
     maintain mission readiness and can be used at main or alternate FSS fitness facilities.
     Wing/CCs or designee must conduct an ORM and determine if access will be restricted to
     specific activity areas, (e.g., cardiovascular and strength equipment, locker rooms, group
     exercise/unit PT areas.) (T-1) Provide equipment IAW AF standards to control access after-
     hours. A card swipe system or similar controls access for registered customers. Surveillance
     cameras and DVD recording system will document activities within the facility during after-
     hours use. Wing/CCs or designee must establish a Wingman policy, post written standards
     for facility use, provide an AED, an emergency phone, a First Aid kit, and post emergency
     response procedures, and emergency response procedures for Fire Dept Access. (T-1)
     1.2.2. After-Hours Use at Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) and Munitions Support
     Squadron (MUNSS) Facilities. Air Force mission requirements often place Airmen in duty
     locations where main operating base (MOB) fitness facilities are unavailable. However,
     Airmen at such locations remain accountable for maintaining Air Force physical fitness
     standards and therefore, unsupervised after-hours use of fitness facilities is permitted at
     MUNSS and GSU locations/installations. Wing/CCs or designee must conduct an ORM,
     establish a Wingman policy, post written standards for facility use, provide an AED, an
     emergency phone, a First Aid kit, and post emergency response procedures. (T-2)
1.3. Alternate Fitness Facilities.
     1.3.1. Additional Fitness and Sports Centers. Additional FSCs operate a minimum of 30
     staffed hours per week and contain the full complement of equipment and services. (T-1)
     These facilities include all courts, group exercise areas, fitness equipment areas
     (cardiovascular, free weight, and selectorized), steam or sauna rooms, showers, lockers, and
AFI34-266 8 DECEMBER 2014                                                                           7


   equipment issue for customer use. Single areas separate from, but in proximity to, the main
   FSC such as ball courts (basketball, volleyball, wallyball, racquetball, etc.), weight rooms,
   and aerobic or group exercise areas do not qualify as additional FSC facilities; these areas
   (annexes) are considered part of the main FSC.
   1.3.2. Satellite Fitness and Sports Facilities. A satellite fitness and sports facility operates a
   minimum of 30 staffed hours per week, is geographically separated from the main FSC, is
   established to provide additional capabilities during peak periods and must be operated by
   the fitness FSC staff on a no-fee basis. Use of these facilities will not be restricted to specific
   units. (T-1) Typically these facilities provide more than one area such as ball courts
   (basketball, volleyball, wallyball, racquetball, etc), weight rooms, locker rooms, and aerobic
   or group exercise areas. NOTE: Satellite facilities provide several core activities, but are not
   considered full-service main FSCs or annexes.
   1.3.3. ANG Fitness Rooms. The ANG has Wing designated Fitness Rooms maintained by
   the FSS; all other Fitness Rooms will be considered UPTFs. The Fitness Room is typically
   self-help operated and generally provides areas and equipment for cardiovascular, strength
   and group exercise as space allows.
   1.3.4. Unit Physical Training Facility (UPTF). The Installation Commander authorizes
   UPTFs (unit owned, funded and maintained fitness areas not operated by the FSS) when they
   validate the installation’s fitness facilities cannot meet the requesting unit’s requirements.
   The number of UPTFs are to be kept to a minimum and approved only when circumstances
   warrant their existence. (T-3) Requests for a UPTF are submitted by the unit commander
   through the FSS commander/director civilian leader. UPTF fitness equipment must meet AF
   Fitness and Sports standards. Units approved to operate a UPTF will coordinate appropriate
   equipment with the FSM prior to the unit purchasing equipment and maintenance contracts
   using Allowance Standard (AS) 410, Allowance ID: 410COOB, and in accordance with
   manufacturer's recommendations. (T-2) For detailed procedures see AFMAN 23-110,
   USAF Supply Manual. Units with a UPTF must have a local Operating Instruction (OI)
   established that includes, at a minimum, that a Wingman system will be used at all times, an
   AED is available, emergency phone numbers will be posted within the fitness room, and a
   phone will be available within the room for emergency use. (T-3)
1.4. Minimum Age Limit. Age limitations must be displayed in each FSC to ensure a safe
environment for all FSC customers. (T-3) The Air Force standards are consistent with
guidelines established by medical organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics
(AAP), American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), and the National Strength and
Conditioning Association (NSCA). Youth typically need more gradual, carefully organized, and
structured training programs than adults. Youth along with their parent(s) must attend an
equipment orientation class prior to beginning their initial workout. (T-3) Caution is required
while supervising youth in these areas. The intent is to develop the physical fitness and esprit de
corps of Airmen and families while maintaining safety for all customers. Structured family
programs encourage parent and child interaction and develop healthy lifestyle habits. Active
duty members have priority over family members. If over-crowding becomes an issue, local

   emergency response capabilities. (T-0)
   1.5.2. Volunteers. The use of volunteers is beneficial for effective programming.
   Individuals and groups from nearby communities, schools, colleges, family members, as well
   as off-duty military are excellent sources of volunteers. Do not use volunteers to perform
   duties recurring in nature and normally performed by the staff, but use volunteers to
   supplement the established work force. Develop effective training programs to maximize
   volunteer talents. Provide and document volunteers’ training. Recognize volunteer efforts
   by nominating them for local and Air Force-level awards. Volunteers register through the
   Airmen and Family Services Center. See DoDI 1100.21, Voluntary Services in the
   Department of Defense, and AFI 34-101, for additional guidance for accepting volunteer
   services in MWR programs and activities. Unit Physical Training Facilities (UPTF) may not
   use volunteers for facility staffing or exercise programming (i.e., Group Exercise
   Instructors). (T-0)
1.6. Uniforms.
1.6.1. AFI 36-801, Uniforms for Civilian Employees, paragraphs 2.2 and 2.2.1 authorizes the
Headquarters Functional Authority (HAF) to develop specific uniform design based on
functional duty requirements, environmental factors, safety and health consideration. All FSC
civilian employees (APF and NAF) are encouraged to wear appropriate professional attire
similar to the AF Informal Uniform as funding allows. Military FSC employees will wear the
AF Informal Uniform in accordance with the AF guidelines contained in AFI 36-2903, Dress
and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel. (T-1) Uniforms are unit funded for
employees. (T-3) Based on local requirements, employees wear appropriate professional attire
when meeting with leadership or attending off-site meetings. Contractors wear uniforms as
specified in the government or individual service contract and will be appropriate for the activity
as well as for a military environment. AF Informal Uniform policy is established in AFI 36-
2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel.
   1.6.2. Customer Attire. Appropriate clothing must be worn to maintain a proper image in a

Resuscitation/Automated External Defibrillator (CPR/AED) certification. (T-1)
2.4. Fitness Improvement Programs (FIP). These programs target active duty personnel who
do not meet Air Force fitness standards for aerobic fitness, muscular strength and circumferential
tape measurement. Coordination with the installation FAC Manager and UFPMs is required to
ensure appropriate class format, instruction, and attendance documentation. (T-1)
2.5. Fitness Programs Beyond Core (Category B). Programs that provide additional fitness
opportunities may be offered at the discretion of the squadron commander or flight chief. Fees
may be charged for all enhanced programs only to offset verifiable NAF expenses for these
services; these may include, but are not limited to, group exercise classes beyond the core (e.g.,
group cycling, Tai Chi, Yoga, water exercise, etc.) and one-on-one personal fitness training.
   2.5.1. Personal Training Instructors. Personal training may be offered on a fee-for-service
   basis through a NAF personal trainer contract. Contract personal training instructors must
   have verification of at least 100 hours of individual fitness program experience to include

   assessments measure cardio-respiratory fitness, muscular strength and endurance, body
   composition, and flexibility using either a manual or computerized system. Examples of
   assessment modules include a step or sub-maximal cycle test, sit and reach, and skin fold
   calipers. Fitness assessments must be conducted only by contract personal trainers and/or
   trained fitness staff who, at a minimum, have completed the AETC Fitness Specialist Course.
   These fitness assessments are not official fitness assessments and are not meant to replace the
   official fitness assessments the members receive from the FAC. (T-1)
   2.5.3. Family Fitness Classes. FSC may offer family programs such as “Mom ‘n Tots”,
   “Stroller Fitness”, etc., as funding allows meeting local customer needs. Classes may be
   conducted by trained Youth and/or FCS staff or contractors. Background checks are not
   required for instructors of these classes as long as the parents and youth are participating in
   the class together. (T-1)
   2.5.4. For AFR only: Exercise Physiologists at AFRC host installations, programmed with
   non-Defense Health Program funds, may create and implement programs and individually
   council members for fitness improvement purposes.
2.6. Sports Programs. FSCs provide core sports programs for eligible customers and, where
resources are available, provide programs above the intramural level (see Table 2.2). Sports
calendars are developed annually at the beginning of the fiscal year and made available to
AFI34-266 8 DECEMBER 2014                                                                      17


customers. (T-3) Calendars give an overview of sports offered at the installation and include
start dates, letter of intent due dates, coach’s meeting dates, and projected end dates.
   2.6.1. Youth Sports Partnership. The FSC sports program and the Youth Sports program
   will maintain separate operations. (T-1) However, where and when feasible, both programs
   are encouraged to partner together for cost savings and program efficiency in areas such as
   sharing and maintaining sports fields, ordering and storing equipment, and ordering trophies.
   2.6.2. Outdoor Fields. The FSM must team with representatives from safety, Base Civil
   Engineer, and Military Public Health (Military Public Health is only needed if food is sold at
   outdoor fields) and perform a pre-season and post-season inspection. (T-1)
   2.6.3. Commander’s Trophy. Installations should consider implementing a Commander's
   Trophy initiative to promote participation in the sports program. Participation at meetings
   should be recognized as another way to earn Commander's Trophy points. Coordinate the
   meeting minutes through the FSS commander/civilian leader (or designee) for approval.
   Provide a copy of the approved minutes to all council members. (T-3)
   2.6.4. Sports Equipment. FSMs must ensure appropriate equipment is purchased with APFs

   Award Ceremonies and Gifts, for guidance. (T-1)
2.7. Fitness and Sports Advisory Council. This optional council meets as necessary and
functions as an advisory body to serve as a communication method among units to assist,
coordinate, and assemble installation resources to support comprehensive fitness and sports
programs. Recommend FSMs establish multiple methods of receiving and implementing inputs
from council members if assembling the full council is not necessary or practical. If a council is
established, then the following applies: The FSM is the chairperson (a non-voting member).
The council should include a primary and an alternate representative from each unit or tenant of
the installation.

                                        council.
2.8. Core Sports Programs. Core sports programs are Category A and promote organized
sports and esprit de corps. The intramural program is recreational in nature. The installation
commander determines participation which may include active duty, guardsmen and reservists
assigned to installation units. (T-2) Active duty military personnel always have first priority in
intramural sports participation (follow eligibility criteria established in AFI 34-101). Other
categories of customers may participate in the intramural program if their participation is needed
to offer a particular program. The FSM designates an intramural specialist who works for the
SPM at installations with large sports programming. (T-3) This is not a mandatory position but
is often used on an as needed basis.
2.9. Sports Programs Above the Intramural Level. These sports programs provide
opportunities for base athletes to compete off base, with other base, civilian, university and club
teams. Financial guidance is provided in DoDI 1015.10, Programs For Military Morale,
Welfare And Recreation (MWR); AFI 34-201, Use of Nonappropriated Funds (NAFs); and AFI
65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) and
Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities. APFs should be used where authorized. NAFs
required to support these programs must be included in the NAF budget and submitted for
approval by the NAF Council and installation commander, with the exception of Air Force or
Armed Forces programs. (T-1)
   2.9.1. Extramural Sports. This program is above the intramural program level and may be
   conducted when demand exists and resources allow.
   2.9.2. Varsity Sports. Varsity sports programs are optional above the intramural level and
   based on number of adequate participants and availability of resources (see Table 2.3).
   Varsity sports offer skilled military athletes an opportunity to compete off the installation in
   competitive programs and serve as a feeder program into higher-level Air Force competition.
   FSMs should establish partnerships with community organizations to the greatest extent
AFI34-266 8 DECEMBER 2014                                                                   19


   possible to broaden the scope of league play. Other DoD ID cardholders must have
   installation commander approval to participate. (T-2) Civilians, including civilian coaches,
   are not authorized permissive TDY merely to participate in sporting events. Support for
   varsity programs may include purchase of uniforms, scheduling games with local teams, and
   paying entry fees for local leagues or tournaments. If competition is located out-of-town,
   transportation support is authorized, entry fees may be paid with NAFs, and a daily personal
   maintenance allowance may be allocated. Funding availability determines payment of
   expenses. For away games, varsity staff will arrange transportation and lodging, confirm
   game times, process duty releases/permissive TDY orders or permissive leave, process
   entry/game fees, and provide uniforms and applicable playing equipment. Ensure Varsity
   Booster Clubs comply with AFI 34-223, Private Organization (PO) Program. (T-1)

   2.9.3. Air Force Marathon. Installations may treat the Air Force Marathon as a varsity
   event. Installation tenant organizations such as MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs, with the
   approval of their host installation commander, may competitively select active duty
   individuals/teams not selected for installation varsity representation to participate in the
   marathon. These participants can be provided the same permissive TDY and NAF support as
   varsity teams. The installation, MAJCOM, or other organizational commander (or
   equivalent) providing NAF funding determines the amount of such funding to be provided
   for the participants as well as the number of participants supported for each marathon. (T-3)

NOTES:
* At no time shall services (i.e., body wraps, etc.) be publicized to customers as a means
to help pass the fitness assessment.

** Develop a local PCA operation instruction (OI) in coordination with the Airman and
Family Services Flight Chief. The installation commander must approve the OI. There
must be a 30” high clear partition, e.g., one-half inch thick shatterproof tempered glass,
allowing for direct line-of-sight supervision, with an entry/exit that can isolate the child
play area completely from other areas. Local policy will be posted in the PCA that
address the following: children must be supervised by their own parents/legal guardians;
parents/legal guardians must maintain direct line-of-sight supervision of their children at
all times; the maximum capacity of children and adults in the PCA; the age limit for the
children using the PCA and indicating whether users must sign in at the reception desk
acknowledging PCA policies. It is recommended that adults bring toys for their children;
toys must be of a non-violent nature. If the FSC provides toys or other play objects, they
must be sanitized daily with bleach and water solution (1/4 cup liquid household bleach
and 1 gallon of tap water) or other approved sanitation solution IAW with Child
Development Center standards. Allow toys to air dry. Other surfaces cleaned with this
solution should be allowed to air dry or be dried with a paper towel after the solution has
been in contact with the surface for two minutes. If a TV is provided, include guidelines
in the OI, e.g., only child-appropriate stations will be shown; only G-Rated videos will be
played. Provide a protective shield for the TV to prevent damage from children and
flying projectiles. Secure the remote or channel control from children. When possible
provide safety enhancements such as cipher locks to the PCA to restrict use from
unauthorized customers, as determined in the OI. Refer to the UFC 4-740-02, Unified
Facilities Criteria: Fitness Centers, located on the AF Fitness and Sports Manager’s
website.

*** The Parent/Youth Area is optional. Area typically houses a stretching area; one 8-
piece selectorized circuit weight equipment line for adults; one 8-piece selectorized
circuit weight equipment line for youth; and two to four cardiovascular machines. Prior
education and training for using the PYA includes a classroom session (may be attended
by only the parent) and a hands-on session with the equipment (must be attended by both
the parent and youth). Coordination with the Airman and Family Services Flight Chief is
required.

under a maintenance contract and adheres to the contract terms to maintain warranties. The FSC
staff ensures a documented equipment maintenance plan following manufacturer guidelines is in
place for all equipment and adheres to the manufacturer’s recommendations for maximum
equipment function and durability. (T-1)
   5.4.1. Customer Cleaning. The FSC staff should encourage customers to clean equipment
   after each use to provide a clean surface for the next user. The FSC provides paper or cloth
   towels and cleaning solutions (as locally determined) to sanitize equipment after use. (T-1)
   5.4.2. Broken Equipment. When possible, the FSC staff will remove broken equipment
   from the area. If the equipment cannot be removed, a professionally designed "Out of Order"

6.5. First Aid Kit. The FSC staff may provide limited medical attention when participants
suffer injuries or illness during FSC programs. Coordinate procedures with the Medical Group
Commander designee to determine extent of assistance and proper training. Each fitness facility
maintains First Aid kits. Contents to be determined by the Medical Group Commander designee.
The FSM will also need to coordinate with the Medical Group Commander designee for
procurement and maintenance of AEDs at each fitness facility and/or annex. Funding for the
procurement and maintenance of AEDs is determined locally. (T-1)
6.6. Medical Considerations. Physical contact or collision sports participants must have
clearance from a doctor of medicine or osteopathy prior to participation. The Medical Group
Commander or designee determines the medical evaluation. (T-1)
6.7. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Participants in sports and recreational programs
that may result in physical contact will use PPE (i.e., mouth guards, eye protection, knee and
ankle braces). (T-1) These devices help reduce and may eliminate injury.
6.8. Customer Protection. FSM have a monitoring system (cameras or a duress alarm if a
camera is not appropriate) installed in FSC areas where staff or contractors do not have direct
line of sight. (T-1) This also applies to areas where staff/contractor may be alone with a
customer. This does not apply to changing rooms, rest rooms or showers. Any duress alarm is
the type/design that allows the user to push a button once and the alarm continuously sounds
until it is reset by the respondent.
