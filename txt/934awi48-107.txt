                                 EXTREME COLD PROCEDURES.

A1.1. Training.
   A1.1.1. Supervisors are required to ensure all workers that normally work outside in the cold read this
   instruction and all of the attachments annually as cold weather training.
   A1.1.2. Supervisor will document cold weather training on the worker’s AF Form 55, Employee
   Safety and Health Record.

A1.2. Cold Weather Conditions.
   A1.2.1. Obtain base wind chill factor from the 934th Command Post, (612)713-1777, or Maintenance
   Operations Center (MOC) (612)713-1328.
   A1.2.2. If the Command Post and Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) are closed, use Attach-
   ment 4, Wind Chill Temperature (WCT) Index Chart to find out the wind chill factor. Current tem-
   perature (o F) and wind speeds in mph (miles per hour) for the Minneapolis-St. Paul International
   Airport can be obtained using the following web site: http://weather.noaa.gov/weather/current/
   KMSP.html

A1.3. Clothing. Dress appropriately for the cold weather (see Attachment 2). Civilians will provide
their own cold weather clothing.

A1.4. Engineering Controls.
   A1.4.1. Use approved heating devices to warm the area of work.
   A1.4.2. The following limits will be adhered to when the wind-chill index is below 00 Fahrenheit (F).
   These limits are for personnel working in unprotected areas who are wearing proper cold weather
   clothing. During low temperature operation, the buddy system will be used. At least two people will
   be in the same area. They will monitor each other for signs of frostbite and will call for assistance if
   needed. Heaters will be used when possible to warm personnel and equipment.

                        GENERAL SAFETY ITEMS FOR COLD WEATHER

A2.1. Pain in the extremities may be the first early warning of danger to cold stress. During exposure to
cold, maximum severe shivering develops when the body core temperature decreases a few degrees. Max-
imum shivering is a major sign of danger to the worker and the worker must be taken to a warm shelter
immediately (not dependent on the wind chill factor).

A2.2. The onset of heavy shivering, frostbite, the feeling of excessive fatigue, drowsiness, irritability, or
euphoria are indications for immediate return to the shelter (heated). When entering the heated shelter, the
outer layer of clothing should be removed and the remainder of the clothing loosened to permit sweat
evaporation or a change of dry work clothing provided.

A2.3. If the person's exposed skin becomes wet (jet fuel, water, etc.), the danger of injury is greatly
increased. The person should immediately go to a warm area and clean and dry the exposed wet skin area
and change into dry clothing if needed.

A2.4. Contact frostbite is when the person’s skin touches very cold metal and the skin becomes frostbite.
To prevent contact frostbite, the worker should wear gloves or mittens when handling cold metal or warm
up the metal surface. When the metal temperature is around +200 F or below, the workers should use cau-
tion when handling metal surfaces without skin protection. When cold surfaces are below 00 F, the surface
should be warmed and/or the person wears gloves or mittens.

A2.5. Remember that freezing injuries are preventable. If one freezing injury occurs, everyone who was
exposed to the same conditions should be reviewed also.

A2.6. Dehydration. Working in cold areas causes significant water losses through the skin and lungs as a
result of the dryness of the air. Increased fluid intake is essential to prevent dehydration, which affects the
flow of blood to the extremities and increases the risk of cold injury. The worker should drink warm,
sweet, caffeine-free, nonalcoholic drinks and soup for fluid replacement and caloric energy.

A2.7. Salt. A normal, balanced diet should take care of salt needs. Using salt tablets is not recommended.
Salt tablets may cause stomach irritation, which may include nausea and vomiting.

A2.8. Diet. Eat a well-balanced diet.

                                   COLD WEATHER CLOTHING

A3.1. Layers of Clothes. Workers should wear several layers of clothing instead of a single heavy outer
garment. Loose layers of clothing with air space between them under an outer wind- and water-resistance
garment provide maximum protection. It is flexible in that inner layers may be removed for comfort and
efficiency to permit escape of perspiration in higher ambient temperatures or during strenuous physical
exertion. Clothing wet by perspiration loses much of its insulating value, and care must be taken to pre-
vent perspiration from accumulating in the clothing. All articles of clothing must be loose, to avoid con-
striction and tightness. Clothing must be kept free of grease and dirt. Dirty or greasy clothing loses much
of its insulation value. The outer layer should be windproof and waterproof.

A3.2. Gloves and/or Mittens. Gloves and/or mittens should be worn in cold weather. Mittens should be
used instead of gloves if the air temperature is 00 F or less. Mittens are better than gloves because they
present less surface area for heat loss.

A3.3. Foot protection. Insulated boots sealed inside and outside provide best-known foot protection by
vapor barriers. When two pairs of socks are worn, the inside pair should be smaller, and be made of cot-
ton. Boots should be waterproofed and socks changed when they become sweat soaked. Air insole cush-
ions and felt liners should be used with chemical and/or water resistance boots.
    A3.3.1. When exposed to cold temperatures and foot crushing hazards; if cold weather footwear,
    which also provides crushing protection, is not available, personnel will be issued footwear that pro-
    tects against the possibility of frostbite.

A3.4. Head. Face, which has good circulation of blood, will usually be adequately protected if a for-
ward-projecting fur ruff is available to protect against wind. Masks are not recommended for prolonged
use in extreme cold because frostbite may develop unnoticed.
    A3.4.1. Keeping the head covered is important, because as much as 40 percent of body heat can be
    lost when the head is exposed.
    A3.4.2. Double-layered goggles with foam padding around the edges are effective in extremely cold
    conditions.
    A3.4.3. Wear a hood and/or cap to keep the head and ears warm. A wool knit cap provides warmth to
    the head. Face protectors (ski mask, face mask, etc.) must be removed periodically, so the worker can
    be checked for signs of frostbite.

                            COLD WEATHER INJURY INFORMATION

A4.1. Most of the cold injuries can be divided into two categories - freezing (frost-bite) and non-freezing.
Non-freezing injuries include chilblains, trench foot and hypothermia.

A4.2. Pain in the extremities may be the first early warning of danger to cold stress. During exposure to
cold, maximum severe shivering develops when the body core temperature decreases a few degrees. Max-
imum shivering is a major sign of danger to the worker and the worker must be taken to a warm shelter
immediately (not dependent on the wind chill factor).

A4.3. Chilblains and Trench Foot.
   A4.3.1. Cause: They are a result of exposure to temperatures above freezing but, usually, less than
   about +500 F. Injury results from constriction of blood flow due to exposure to both cold and wet.
   A4.3.2. Symptoms.
       A4.3.2.1. The skin turns white, numb, and wrinkly followed by redness, swelling, and PAIN
       when re-warmed.
       A4.3.2.2. Prolonged loss of blood flow to the skin can result in nerve and muscle damage to bad
       complications.
       A4.3.2.3. The complications may be local infection leading to amputation or generalized infec-
       tion leading to death.
   A4.3.3. First Aid
       A4.3.3.1. Call 911 for medical emergency.
       A4.3.3.2. Warm affected area with direct body heat (gradual warming).
       A4.3.3.3. Dry clean clothing.
       A4.3.3.4. DO NOT massage or rub.
       A4.3.3.5. DO NOT wet the area or rub with snow or ice.
       A4.3.3.6. DO NOT expose affected area to open fire, stove, or any other intense heat source.

A4.4. Immersion Foot (Trench Foot)
   A4.4.1. Cause: Prolonged exposure of feet to wet conditions at temperatures between 32 and 50 F.
   Inactivity and damp socks and boots (or tightly laced boots that impair circulation) speed onset and
   severity.
   A4.4.2. Symptoms
       A4.4.2.1. Cold, numb feet may progress to hot with shooting pains.
       A4.4.2.2. Swelling, redness, and bleeding.
   A4.4.3. First Aid
8                                                                        934AWI48-107 27 JULY 2006


       A4.4.3.1. Call 911 for medical emergency.
       A4.4.3.2. Rewarm feet by exposing them to warm air.
       A4.4.3.3. DO NOT massage, rub, moisten, or expose affected area to extreme heat.

A4.5. Dehydration. A worker loses a lot of water when breathing in a cold environment.
    A4.5.1. Cause: Depletion of body fluids.
    A4.5.2. Symptoms: Dizziness and weakness.
    A4.5.3. First Aid
       A4.5.3.1. Replace lost water. Water should be sipped, not gulped.
       A4.5.3.2. Get medical attention, call 911.

A4.6. Hypothermia
    A4.6.1. Cause: It is the lowering of the body’s core temperature. Lower body core temperature will
    likely result in reduced mental alertness, reduction in rational decision making, or loss of conscious-
    ness with the threat of fatal consequences.
       A4.6.1.1. Sedative drugs and alcohol increase the risk of hypothermia. Alcohol dilates the blood
       vessels near the skin surface, which increases heat loss and lowers body temperature.
    A4.6.2. Symptoms
       A4.6.2.1. Hypothermia - first symptoms are uncontrollable shivering and the sensation of cold.
       As the body becomes colder, the shivering stops and the person losses coordination, fatigue, cool
       bluish skin, slurred speech, clumsy movements, confused behavior, loss of memory the heartbeat
       slows and sometimes becomes irregular. The pulse weakens and the blood pressure changes until
       the person dies.
       A4.6.2.2. Pain in the extremities can be the first early warning of dangerous exposure to cold.
       Severe shivering must be taken as a sign of danger and the worker should go to a warm area imme-
       diate.
    A4.6.3. First Aid
       A4.6.3.1. Call 911 for emergency help.
       A4.6.3.2. Move the person to a warm, dry area. Don’t leave the person alone.
       A4.6.3.3. Remove wet/cold clothing.
       A4.6.3.4. May use PASSIVE HEATING METHODS like placing warm covers or blankets on
       person to preventing further heat loss. Use pre-warmed blankets when possible.
       A4.6.3.5. DO NOT use ACTIVE HEAT METHODS (using external heat sources and administra-
       tion of internal warm fluids) to warm the person. A medical doctor must be present before you use
       active heat processes.
934AWI48-107 27 JULY 2006                                                                                9


A4.7. Frostbite.
   A4.7.1. Cause: Frostbite requires freezing temperature and represents the freezing of water in the skin
   and underlying soft tissues of the skin. The colder the temperature, the faster it can happen. The
   effects are more severe if the injured area is thawed and then refrozen. Frostbite is the most common
   injury resulting from exposure to cold elements. Usually, the frozen area is small. The nose, cheeks,
   ears, fingers, and toes are most commonly affected, because they have less blood flow for surface
   area. Often the victim isn't aware of frostbite until someone else notices the poor skin coloration. The
   danger of frostbite is increased if you are tired or your body's normal resistance is low because of a
   recent illness.
   A4.7.2. Symptoms
       A4.7.2.1. Just before frostbite occurs, the affected skin may appear red, and then becomes painful.
       A4.7.2.2. As frostbite develops:
          A4.7.2.2.1. The skin changes to white or grayish-yellow in appearance.
          A4.7.2.2.2. Pain is sometimes felt early but subsides later (often there is NO pain).
          A4.7.2.2.3. Blisters may appear later.
          A4.7.2.2.4. The affected part feels intensely cold and numb.
          A4.7.2.2.5. The victim frequently is not aware of frostbite until someone tells him or he
          observes the pale, glossy skin.
       A4.7.2.3. As time passes:
          A4.7.2.3.1. There is mental confusion and impairment of judgment.
          A4.7.2.3.2. The victim falls and may become unconscious.
          A4.7.2.3.3. Eyesight fails.
          A4.7.2.3.4. The victim falls and may become unconscious.
          A4.7.2.3.5. Shock is evident.
          A4.7.2.3.6. Breathing may cease.
          A4.7.2.3.7. Death, if it occurs, is usually due to heart failure.
   A4.7.3. First Aid
       A4.7.3.1. Call 911 for medical help.
       A4.7.3.2. Bring the victim to a warm dry area. Don’t leave the person alone.
       A4.7.3.3. If the skin is black in color, blistered, or hard and frozen, get emergency help immedi-
       ately. Do NOT attempt to re-warm victim with above problems without medical advice. Do NOT
       break the blisters.
       A4.7.3.4. Do not thaw out a frostbitten part if you cannot keep it thawed. If the skin is warmed
       and then becomes cold again, it will cause severe tissue damage.
       A4.7.3.5. Do not rub or massage the frostbitten part with snow, or with anything else. Rubbing
       may cause gangrene (tissue death).
10                                                                    934AWI48-107 27 JULY 2006


     A4.7.3.6. Remove wet or frozen clothing and anything that is constricting.
     A4.7.3.7. Provide extra clothing and blankets.
     A4.7.3.8. Give the victim a warm drink (NOT alcohol). Do not allow the victim to use alcohol or
     cigarettes (they restrict blood flow).
     A4.7.3.9. Gently place the affected area in a warm (1050 F) water bath and monitor the water tem-
     perature to SLOWLY warm the tissue. Don’t pour warm water directly on the affected area
     because it will warm the tissue too fast causing tissue damage. Warming takes about 25-40 min-
     utes.
     A4.7.3.10. If warm water is not available or practical to use, wrap the affected part gently in a
     sheet and warm blankets.
     A4.7.3.11. Since severe swelling develops very rapidly after thawing, DISCONTINUE warming
     the victim as soon as the affected part becomes flushed.
     A4.7.3.12. After the affected area has been warmed, it may become puffy and blister. The
     affected area may have a burning feeling or numbness. When normal feeling, movement, and skin
     color have returned, the affected area should be dried and wrapped to keep it warm.
     A4.7.3.13. If fingers or toes are involved, place dry, sterile gauze between them to keep them sep-
     arated. Do not apply other dressings unless the victim is to be transported for medical aid.
     A4.7.3.14. Elevate the frostbitten parts and protect them from contact with bedclothes.
     A4.7.3.15. Once the affected part is re-warmed, have the victim exercise it.
     A4.7.3.16. Do NOT apply heat lamps, hot water bottles, heating pads, hair dryers, etc. Do NOT
     put victim near a hot stove or radiator. Reason: The numb frostbitten parts may be burned before
     feeling returns.
     A4.7.3.17. Do NOT allow the victim to walk after the affected part thaws, if his feet are involved.
     A4.7.3.18. Do NOT allow the victim to use alcohol or cigarettes because they restrict blood flow.

(Frostbite Risk in Dry, Exposed Skin: Little Danger (Green) Frostbite may occur in >2 hours exposure;
Increased Danger (Yellow) Frostbite may occur in < 45 minutes exposure; Great Danger (Red) Frostbite
may occur in < 5 minutes exposure).
Note: The WCT charts are worst case approximations based on mathematical models and data derived
from limited human studies. The exact effect of cold exposure on an individual will vary depending on the
actual activity level, length of exposure, moderating effects of clothing or partial shelter from the wind
and overall physical state. The chart is dated to indicate that this is the first winter of issue (2001-2002).
WCT values are subject to modification as additional human data or other new information becomes
available. Freezing cold injury can occur anytime temperatures (air or surface) fall below freezing (32°F).
However, the likelihood and severity of injury will increase with prolonged exposure to lower tempera-
tures and greater air velocity, whether it is due to vehicle speed or actual wind. WCT is an indication of
the combined effects of wind and colder air temperature. Individual level of activity, protective clothing,
partial shelter from the wind, and overall fitness may alter the actual impact of cold exposure. Even when
temperatures are above freezing, prolonged exposure to cold and wind may result in hypothermia or
non-freezing cold injury (chilblains or trench foot).

                                  EXTREME HEAT PROCEDURES
With the arrival of hot weather, it is important to be aware of the potential for workers to develop heat
stress, especially outdoor workers. The supervisor is responsible for the health of his/her workers when
they are working in hot weather.

A6.1. Supervisors are required to ensure all workers that normally work outside in the heat have annual
training on extreme heat procedures. Supervisor will document this training on the worker’s AF Form 55,
Employee Safety and Health Record.

A6.2. The supervisor should consider the following items:
     A6.2.1. Reschedule the work for a different day.
     A6.2.2. Schedule the work during the cooler part of the day (morning or evening).
     A6.2.3. Move the work from direct sunlight (inside the hangar).
     A6.2.4. Assign additional workers to the job.
     A6.2.5. Provide mechanical systems for cooling.
     A6.2.6. Use the heat stress chart (see Attachment 7) for recommended work/rest cycles and amount
     of water to drink.
     A6.2.7. Know your workers: age, physical fitness, are they acclimated to the heat, overweight, etc.

A6.3. Management retains the right to take whatever actions may be necessary to carry out the mission
during emergencies.

A6.4. Heat stress disorders.
     A6.4.1. Heat Stroke.
        A6.4.1.1. Symptoms: Little or no sweating, hot dry red or spotted skin which may be red, mot-
        tled or bluish, mental confusion, delirium, loss of consciousness, convulsions or coma.
        A6.4.1.2. Cause: The most severe heat disorder. It occurs when the body’s temperature regulatory
        system fails and sweating becomes inadequate.
        A6.4.1.3. Treatment: This is a medical emergency, call 911! Keep the person in as cool and
        shady area as possible. Remove or open clothing. Cool body by liberally sprinkling with water and
        fanning. Give cool water to drink, except if unconscious. Sip water slowly, and for second quart
        give cool salt water, prepared by dissolving two salt tablets or one-forth teaspoon (TSP) of salt in
        a full quart of water. Remove boots, elevate legs.
        A6.4.1.4. Prevention: Acclimatization. Close monitoring of workers for signs of heat illness.
        Drink plenty of water. Use work/rest cycles.
     A6.4.2. Heat Exhaustion.
        A6.4.2.1. Symptoms: Sweating, paleness, extreme weakness or fatigue, giddiness, nausea, short-
        ness of breath or headache.

     A6.4.2.2. Cause: Dehydration causes blood volume to decrease.
     A6.4.2.3. Treatment: Rest in a cool area. Elevate feet, apply wet cloths, and drink water. Call 911
     and report the incident and get medical help. Time is important.
     A6.4.2.4. Prevention: Acclimatization. Drink plenty of water. Use work/rest cycles.
  A6.4.3. Heat Cramps / Muscle Cramps.
     A6.4.3.1. Symptoms: Painful muscle spasms in the arms, legs or abdomen. Cramps may occur
     during or after working hours.
     A6.4.3.2. Cause: Generally caused by sweating and hard work without adequate fluid and salt
     intake.
     A6.4.3.3. Treatment: Rest in a cool area. Allow to recline, drink cool water, and eat foods with
     salt. Call 911 and report the incident and get medical help.
     A6.4.3.4. Prevention: Adequate water intake and adequate salt intake with meals. Use of salt tab-
     lets is not recommended.
  A6.4.4. Heat Rash/Prickly Heat.
     A6.4.4.1. Symptoms: Tiny, raised, blister-like rash.
     A6.4.4.2. Cause: Skin is constantly wet from sweat.
     A6.4.4.3. Treatment: Keep skin clean and dry.
     A6.4.4.4. Prevention: Shower after working in hot environments. Keep skin dry and rest in cool
     area.
  A6.4.5. Fainting.
     A6.4.5.1. Symptoms: Fainting. Usually affects person not acclimatized to a hot environment who
     simply stand still in the heat.
     A6.4.5.2. Cause: Pooling of blood in the legs and skin from prolonged static posture and heat
     exposure.
     A6.4.5.3. Treatment: Persons usually recover quickly after being allowed to lie down. Drink
     water.
     A6.4.5.4. Prevention: Moving, rather than standing still, will usually prevent fainting.
