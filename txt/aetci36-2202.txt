CCAF requirements outlined in Section B, paragraph 21.5, and paragraph 22.2 do not apply the
Inter-American Air Forces Academy (IAAFA).

AU technical training consists of the chaplain assistant specialty courses.

Continuing accreditation of CCAF through AU by the Southern Association of Colleges and
Schools, Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC), is the basis for certain requirements in this
instruction. Additionally, Section L contains guidance on conducting master instructor programs
for technical training personnel. References to training squadrons include geographically
separated units (GSU). The term GSU includes detachments and operating locations.

This instruction applies to all the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard
personnel or units attached to AETC in support of technical training.

This instruction does not apply to other service instructors teaching service specific courses on
Air Force installations unless specified by applicable memorandum of agreement.

Commanders responsible for implementing this instruction may supplement this instruction to
establish specific implementing procedures. All 2 AF units will send waiver requests,
recommended changes, and proposed supplements through their training group or wing and 2 AF
with a courtesy copy to HQ AETC/A3PV. 2 AF will then forward inputs to HQ AETC/A3PV
for final coordination on supplements and disposition of waivers by HQ AETC/A3P. Refer
recommended changes to this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using
the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the
field through the numbered Air Force. Submit requests for waivers to any requirement stated in
this instruction in accordance with guidance in AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms
Management. Address waiver requests to HQ AETC/A3P. Waiver requests must identify the
specific policy requirement to be waived and adverse impact on the mission caused by
compliance with the policy requirements. Note: A waiver remains in effect until the approving
official cancels it in writing, the publication is revised, or the waiver expires. When the
publication is revised, the requester must renew the waiver.

Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records,
and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in the

1. Mission. Faculty development units provide job preparation and continuation training related
to specific job functions of personnel assigned to technical training schools. These personnel
include instructors who teach training courses; support personnel who develop, manage, and
evaluate training programs; and specific commanders in training organizations.
2. Teaching and Learning Technology Training. Faculty development units provide training
that prepares and supports faculty in the use of instructional technology. Instructors are trained
to integrate technology in and out of the classroom, while curriculum development managers are
trained to be knowledgeable of technological advances in training delivery and to effectively
apply the instructional systems development (ISD) process throughout the analysis, design,
development, implementation, and evaluation of technology-based training.
3. Technical Training Management System (TTMS) Training. TTMS includes an integrated
suite of software tools currently used for course analysis, design, development, documentation,
evaluation, and student administration, as well as the hardware infrastructure used to support
these software applications. Faculty assigned to technical training groups will receive
standardized training on the system in order to comply with the utilization requirements of this
technology found in AETCI 36-2203, Technical and Basic Military Training Development, and
AETCI 36-2215, Technical and Basic Military Training Administration.
4. Faculty Development Management. A faculty development executive council (FDEC), a
faculty development working group (FDWG), and a 2 AF faculty development functional
manager (2 AF Fac D FM) provide management oversight of AETC faculty development. The
FDEC and FDWG establish the structure and processes for the professional development of
faculty and staff members in the technical training environment. Education and training needs
are determined by the FDEC and FDWG in a forum comparable to a utilization and training
workshop. The functional manager aligns the activities of the FDEC and FDWG with the AETC
vision and 2 AF goals.

    4.3. Course Development Process for Standardized Faculty Development Courses:
       4.3.1. General:
          4.3.1.1. Standardized Faculty Development Courses. Standardized faculty and
          staff training should be generic in nature to facilitate cross utilization of instructor and
          quota resources. Information in these courses will be taken from applicable Air Force
          and AETC publications. Standardized faculty development courses are jointly
          designed and developed to fulfill the educational and performance needs of
          instructors, instructor supervisors, curriculum development managers, and other
          training support personnel across AETC as identified by the FDEC and FDWG.
AETCI36-2202 23 MAY 2012                                                                     9


        These courses are developed in accordance with AETCI 36-2203 and specific
        instructions in this publication. This publication takes precedence when processes in
        this publication pertaining to standardized faculty development courses conflict with
        AETCI 36-2203.
        4.3.1.2. Standardized Course Control Documents. Standardized course control
        documents for faculty development courses consist of the course training standard,
        course chart, plan of instruction (including major teaching steps), and measurement
        plan. The lesson plan part II (teaching guide) will be standardized to the major
        teaching steps.
     4.3.2. Course Development Process:
        4.3.2.1. The 2 AF Fac D FM issues the development tasking to the prime and
        collateral faculty development units based on the needs identified by the FDWG,
        validated by the FDEC, and documented in the working group/executive council
        minutes.
        4.3.2.2. The prime faculty development unit is responsible for developing the
        standardized course control documents for the assigned courses. The prime unit
        works in collaboration with the collateral faculty development units for input, review,
        and coordination on all course documents. The 2 AF Fac D FM has the final decision
        authority over issues that cannot be resolved through collaboration and consensus.
        4.3.2.3. The prime unit will develop and provide template documents for
        measurement items, lesson plan part II (below the major teaching steps), and student
        instructional materials, such as study guides, handouts, multimedia, and audiovisual
        aids for the assigned courses. Collateral units may modify these template documents
        to meet local needs. Modifications based on local supplement guidance should be
        identified as such.
        4.3.2.4. The 2 AF Fac D FM will review and approve all standardized course training
        standards, course charts, plans of instruction, and measurement plans.

Section B—Community College of the Air Force (CCAF)

6. CCAF Affiliation. The process of affiliation identifies and describes service schools and
educational organizations within the CCAF system. Affiliated schools teach collegiate-level
courses contributing to CCAF degree programs, and affiliation enables those schools to mutually
share the benefits and responsibilities of the regional accreditation held by CCAF as part of AU.
CCAF-affiliated AETC schools must adhere to all requirements outlined in this instruction and
in the CCAF Campus Affiliations Policies, Procedures, and Guidelines (PPG), found at
https://ccaf.maxwell.af.mil/nonpub/ccaf_pdf/dec/PPG.pdf (hereafter referred to as the CCAF
PPG), to ensure the school maintains the quality standards for affiliation and supports the
institutional integrity and accreditation of CCAF. The training group, or equivalent, within
AETC technical training is synonymous with the term school as used in the PPG.
7. Designating CCAF Courses. CCAF is the OPR for identifying degree-applicable courses.
Training managers within affiliated schools forward revised and modified course control
documents (plan of instruction and course charts) to CCAF for evaluation.
8. Student Transcript, Administration, and Record System – Faculty Database (STARS-
FD). STARS-FD is a CCAF web-based system providing “real-time” faculty documentation.
AETC affiliated schools and candidate schools must use STARS-FD to record credentialing
information for CCAF faculty. Refer to the CCAF PPG and STARS-FD user manual for more
information on documenting each tab of the instructor record. The STARS-FD user manual is
available online for viewing and downloading in the Toolbox section of STARS-FD.
9. Responsibilities:
   9.1. Training groups or wing will:
       9.1.1. Designate, in writing, in addition to the CCAF PPG-mandated affiliated school
       liaison (ASL), points of contact (POC) within the wing, groups, and/or squadrons to
       assist the ASL in managing CCAF program requirements.
           9.1.1.1. The ASL will provide training to designated POC and instructor supervisors
           in the use of STARS-FD and the PPG. POC and instructor supervisors may attend
           the ASL workshop conducted by CCAF.
           9.1.1.2. The POC will establish procedures to oversee faculty qualification
           documentation throughout their assigned training squadrons and/or flights. The POC
           must work through the group ASL to resolve issues with instructor documentation in
           STARS-FD.
   9.2. Ensure each classroom or lab where a CCAF course is taught is identified as a CCAF
   classroom.

Section C—Prefix T Positions

10. Purpose of Prefix T. The Air Force specialty code (AFSC) prefix T identifies positions on
manpower documents, as well as enlisted airmen and officers serving in, qualified to serve in, or

AETCI36-2202 23 MAY 2012                                                                         15


   instructor resource bill for BIC, the sister service can choose to re-validate their requirements
   or provide the instructor resource. Sister service instructor resource issues for BIC will be
   adjudicated with HQ AETC/A3T and HQ AETC/A3P.
   14.2. When an Air Force interservice instructor teaches in a consolidated course managed by
   another service, DoD agency, or multi-service school (i.e., METC), guidance for training
   requirements, designation of the training provider, the instructor evaluation process, and
   other instructor requirements should be outlined in the memorandum of agreement (MOA).
   The instructor is trained and evaluated according to the managing service’s criteria or school
   MOA. Note: Air Force instructors teaching Air Force-service unique courses on the METC
   follow the METC MOA and applicable policies.
15. Instructor Supervisor. The instructor supervisor is a qualified instructor whose
responsibilities are to perform instructor duties and to supervise and evaluate other instructors.
   15.1. Technical training instructor supervisors must be qualified in a minimum of 80 hours
   of instruction in the course or courses they supervise and must maintain qualification and
   proficiency in the portion or portions of the course or courses they are qualified to teach.
   Hours may be in one course (for example, one 80 hour block or two 40 hour blocks within a
   single course) or a combination of hours from several courses (for example, one 40 hour
   course plus one 40 hour block in a different course). Supervisory duties must not preclude
   the instructor supervisor’s primary duty as an instructor. Note: Instructor supervisors in the
   982 TRG and IAAFA are required to maintain qualification and proficiency in courses in
   their AFSC. They are not required to maintain qualification or proficiency in courses outside
   their AFSC.
   15.2. DELETED.
   15.3. On rare occasions, a person may be assigned to an instructor supervisor position
   without prior instructor experience. Under these circumstances, the instructor supervisor
   must meet all of the requirements of a first-tour instructor and cannot perform instructor
   evaluations while in student instructor status.
16. Intermediate Supervisor. The intermediate supervisor or equivalent is a qualified
instructor whose responsibilities are to perform instructor duties and coordinate the efforts and
activities of instructor supervisors when the squadron commander determines the span-of-control
of the flight commander or chief is excessive and warrants the position.
   16.1. One level above the instructor supervisor, but below the flight commander or chief, the
   intermediate supervisor position requires the same training and qualifications as the
   instructor supervisor.
   16.2. Technical training intermediate supervisors must be qualified in a minimum of 80
   hours of instruction in the course or courses they supervise and must maintain qualification
   and proficiency in the portion or portions of the course or courses they are qualified to teach.
   Hours may be in one course (for example, one 80 hour block or two 40 hour blocks within a
   single course) or a combination of hours from several courses (for example, one 40 hour
   course plus one 40 hour block in a different course). Supervisory duties must not preclude
   the intermediate supervisor’s primary duty as an instructor. Note: Intermediate supervisors
   in the 982 TRG and IAAFA are required to maintain qualification and proficiency in courses

   in their AFSC. They are not required to maintain qualification or proficiency in courses
   outside their AFSC.
17. Reserve Instructor. Reserve instructors are members of an AFRC unit assigned to assist
the training mission. Reserve instructors receive training necessary for their designated position.
CCAF requirements will apply when reserve instructors are assigned to CCAF degree-applicable
courses. Reserve instructors fall into two primary categories: individual reservist and unit-
assigned reservist.
   17.1. Individual reservist instructors are members of the individual ready reserve assigned or
   attached to AETC training squadrons to augment instructor manning during wartime
   mobilization.
   17.2. Unit-assigned reservist instructors are members of AFRC units providing training
   within AETC training wings or groups.
18. Readiness and Emergency Management Instructor. Readiness and emergency
management instructors are personnel with the 3E9X1 AFSC assigned to provide BMT trainees
the fundamental skills to defend against chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-
yield explosive (CBRNE) attacks. Readiness and emergency management instructors are
designated as non-CCAF instructors. They are required to complete BIC or other approved ITC,
a teaching internship, and complete teaching qualification. Although readiness and emergency
management instructors are not required to obtain an academic degree, they are highly
encouraged to do so.
   18.1. DELETED.
   18.2. DELETED.
19. Master Instructor. Master instructors are qualified instructors who have demonstrated
sustained training delivery and professional growth above the minimum AETC training and
performance requirements. Pursuit of master instructor status can begin immediately after
completion of BIC or an approved ITC. Specific requirements for achieving master instructor
status are outlined in Section L.
20. Non-CCAF Instructor. Non-CCAF instructors are instructors described in paragraphs 12-
19 above assigned to teach a non-CCAF-credit awarding course. Officers who teach officer-only
courses, BMT readiness and emergency management instructors, and IAAFA instructors (to
include partner nation guest instructors) are examples of instructors in this category.

         other tests as determined by the education counselor.
  22.3. Training Needs Assessment. Supervisors will complete a training needs assessment
  for all instructors, instructor supervisors, and intermediate supervisors. The training needs
  assessment will be completed during the initial instructor orientation for newly assigned
  instructors and supervisors. For first-tour instructors and supervisors, focus on formal
  training and education needs for the assigned position. For returning instructors and
  supervisors, also include an instructional skills assessment as part of the training needs
  assessment. Note: The training needs assessment is a living document. Supervisors will
  update the training needs assessment as training is completed. Re-assess training needs as
  the scope of responsibilities change, duties are re-aligned, or training requirements change.
     22.3.1. The supervisor plans formal training by assessing the required and recommended
     training courses that instructor, instructor supervisor, and intermediate supervisor
     assignees in specific positions need to successfully perform their duties unassisted.
     Required and recommended training is outlined in Attachment 3.
     22.3.2. Supervisors compare previous military and nonmilitary training, and previous
     education to the instructor or supervisor’s current job requirements. This process
     identifies formal training needed to be an instructor or supervisor, to include specific
     position requirements for instructors, instructor supervisors, and intermediate supervisors
     who teach courses that apply toward a CCAF degree.
     22.3.3. Instructional Skills Assessment:
         22.3.3.1. Supervisors will assess returning instructor’s presentation delivery,
         academic counseling, and other skills required for the current instructor job. The
         supervisor will use the assessment to determine the level of instructor refresher
         training necessary. The supervisor will document his or her assessment and training
         decision as part of the training needs assessment and file according to local
         procedures.
             22.3.3.1.1. If the period of separation from instructor duty is less than 1 year and
             the supervisor determines the instructor’s skills are still satisfactory, the instructor
             does not need to complete refresher training.
 22                                                               AETCI36-2202 23 MAY 2012


               22.3.3.1.2. If the period of separation from instructor duty is less than 1 year and
               refresher training is determined to be necessary, the supervisor will schedule the
               returning instructor for either an instructor refresher course or a comprehensive
               ITC course, as applicable.
               22.3.3.1.3. If the period of separation from instructor duty is more than 1 year,
               and the supervisor determines the instructor’s skills are still satisfactory, the
               instructor does not need to complete a comprehensive ITC. Instead, the
               supervisor will schedule the instructor to complete an instructor refresher course.
               22.3.3.1.4. If the period of separation is more than 1 year and the supervisor
               determines the instructor’s skills are not satisfactory, the supervisor will schedule
               the instructor to complete a comprehensive ITC course.
           22.3.3.2. Assess returning instructors who have previously completed a teaching
           internship and have at least an associate degree to determine if, for refresher
           purposes, repeating the requirements of the teaching internship program would be
           beneficial.
       22.3.4. Training Selection. Supervisors explore and select training resources that most
       effectively address training needs within the required timeframe. HQ AETC/A3PV must
       approve training selected outside of that offered by faculty development units, and the
       training must enable the assignee to work independently and stay current in the duties of
       the assigned position.
       22.3.5. Documentation. Document the training needs assessment for instructors,
       instructor supervisors, and intermediate supervisors according to local procedures.

Section F—Initial Instructor Training

23. Purpose. Initial instructor training provides the framework for instructor assignees to gain
the knowledge and skills needed to become increasingly independent in performing the duties of
the instructor position. The training focuses on developing skills that will enable instructor
assignees to deliver classroom, laboratory, dormitory, or drill instruction.
24. Initial Training Requirements. Initial training consists of required courses necessary to
prepare instructors and instructor supervisors to perform their assigned duties without assistance.
   24.1. Initial training for instructors consists of completing the ITC and teaching internship.
   These formal courses prepare new instructors for initial teaching duties. Initial training also
   includes teaching qualification in the assigned block or blocks of a course. In addition,
   training on motivational training procedures will be provided, if applicable. First-tour
   instructors must be scheduled for their ITC as soon as possible following the instructor’s
   DAS.
   24.2. Initial training for returning instructors consists of completing the ITC or an instructor
   refresher course and the teaching internship per paragraphs 22.3.3. – 22.3.3.2. The specific
   training required is determined during the training needs assessment. Initial training also
   includes teaching qualification in the assigned block or blocks of a course. In addition,
   training on motivational training procedures will be provided, if applicable.

 28                                                              AETCI36-2202 23 MAY 2012


33. Purpose. TQ ensures all instructors are technically competent in their assigned teaching
discipline and have mastered the teaching methods and techniques necessary to be an effective
instructor in the assigned block or blocks of instruction. TQ is a formal process closely
monitored and accurately documented by the instructor supervisor or instructor/trainer.
Successful completion of the TQ process certifies the instructor has the knowledge and skills
necessary to effectively teach the assigned block or blocks of instruction without assistance.
   33.1. Instructors may be qualified in individual units of instruction versus complete blocks
   of instruction for multiple instructor requirement (MIR) purposes. For these instructors,
   substitute “unit” for “block”, where appropriate, throughout this section. Instructors will
   complete initial TQ and subsequent TQ as prescribed on each unit assigned.
   33.2. Instructors who qualify in a block or blocks of a piggyback course are considered
   qualified in the respective block or blocks of all associated courses.
34. Initial TQ Process. The initial TQ process applies to the first block of instruction in which
a new or returning instructor is to be qualified following completion of an ITC, as applicable.
Supervisors will review previous job experience to determine the appropriate block of instruction
for teaching qualification.
   34.1. If motivational training is used in the block of instruction, supervisors will ensure that
   this training is identified as an additional TQ requirement and provide training on procedures
   associated with motivational training. Document completion of training on motivational
   training procedures on a memorandum for record (MFR) and have the instructor
   acknowledge receipt of the training by endorsing the MFR.
       34.1.1. For CCAF instructors, maintain the MFR in the Documents tab of the STARS-
       FD instructor record.
       34.1.2. For non-CCAF instructors, maintain the MFR in the Documents tab of STARS-
       FD or with the AETC Form 10 according to local procedures.
   34.2. Although portions of the TQ process (to include paragraphs 34.3.1. through 34.3.4.)
   may be completed prior to attending the ITC, instructors cannot teach students before
   completing an ITC and establishment of a DAID.
   34.3. As a minimum, the instructor in initial TQ will:
       34.3.1. Review all relevant instructional training materials (lesson plans, study guides,
       workbooks, etc.) and, if applicable, computer-based instruction (CBI).
       34.3.2. DELETED.
       34.3.3. Personalize a lesson plan for the block of instruction in which qualifying.
       Personalized lesson plans must be approved by the instructor supervisor in order to verify
       the added information is accurate and applicable to the lessons before use in the
       classroom. Alternatively, schools may use station lesson plans.
       34.3.4. Pass all measurement items associated with the block of instruction. Qualifying
       instructors must achieve a minimum of 90 percent on each version of the written test for
       each block assigned. Passing all measurement items demonstrates technical competency
       in the assigned teaching discipline.
AETCI36-2202 23 MAY 2012                                                                        29


          34.3.4.1. When there are no written tests contained in the course, the group training
          director will determine evaluation standards for subject-matter proficiency
          verification. These standards must not be lower than the proficiency requirements of
          the students in the course.
          34.3.4.2. If the qualifying instructor fails to achieve a minimum 90 percent score on
          the written test or fails to meet the established standard for subject-matter proficiency
          verification, provide additional training as necessary and retest.
      34.3.5. DELETED.
      34.3.6. DELETED.
   34.4. Newly assigned or returning instructors must complete initial TQ within 90 calendar
   days (120 days for GSUs or 180 days for low-flow courses) of DAID. Instructors assigned to
   low-flow courses where the 180-day limit cannot be met due to course scheduling limitations
   must meet initial qualifications within the minimum time practical within the constraints.
35. Initial TQ Progress Review:
   35.1. Squadron commanders or GSU commanders or chiefs will conduct a progress review
   on all technical training instructors who have not completed initial teaching qualification
   within 90 calendar days (120 days for GSUs or 180 days for low-flow courses) of the DAID.
   The commander or chief, instructor supervisor and/or instructor/trainer, and student
   instructor will review the student instructor’s progress, mitigating circumstances, and
   determine how best to proceed. The training progress review should be handled in a
   constructive manner.
   35.2. Document the results of the review on an MFR and maintain according to local
   procedures. Include specific recommendations to complete qualification training, including
   an estimated completion date and a follow-up review date.
   35.3. Conduct and document follow-up reviews every 30 calendar days until the student
   instructor is qualified, or the instructor supervisor and/or instructor/trainer determines the
   qualifying instructor is unable to meet required standards. Do not exceed a total of 150
   calendar days in initial teaching qualification training following DAID (180 days for GSUs
   or 240 days for low-flow courses) before making a determination on the instructor’s ability to
   meet the required standard.
   35.4. If the instructor supervisor and/or instructor/trainer determine the student instructor
   cannot meet the required standards, the squadron commander or GSU commander or chief
   will review all relevant factors including attitude, professional qualities, experience level,
   past performance, and any unusual circumstances. The squadron commander will forward a
   recommendation to the group commander. GSU commanders or chiefs will forward
   recommendations to their parent unit, as applicable. After considering all factors, the group
   commander may:
      35.4.1. Authorize additional training, as necessary.
      35.4.2. Remove the student instructor from training and request reassignment.
36. Subsequent TQ Process. The subsequent TQ process applies to all other TQ following
initial TQ. Supervisors will review previous job experience to determine the appropriate
 30                                                                 AETCI36-2202 23 MAY 2012


subsequent blocks or courses for TQ following completion of initial TQ. Subsequent TQ can
begin immediately following initial TQ; however, supervisors should provide their instructors
the opportunity to further develop their teaching proficiency and classroom management skills
before assigning new blocks of instruction.

Section I—Subject-Matter Proficiency Testing

40. Purpose. Subject-matter proficiency testing ensures instructors remain technically
competent in their assigned block or blocks of instruction. Subject-matter proficiency testing is
accomplished by successfully passing the written test for each block of instruction the instructor
is qualified to teach. When there are no written tests in the block, the group training director will
determine evaluation standards for subject-matter proficiency verification. These standards must
not be lower than the proficiency requirements of the students in the block.
 32                                                             AETCI36-2202 23 MAY 2012


   40.1. To retain TQ in the applicable block or blocks of instruction, the instructor must
   achieve a minimum of 90 percent accuracy on the written test for the block.
   40.2. Supervisors will decertify any instructor failing to achieve a minimum 90 percent
   accuracy on the written test attempted for the applicable block or blocks of instruction. The
   supervisor will provide necessary remediation to ensure the instructor regains their
   proficiency in the assigned block or blocks of instruction. Instructors must achieve a

Section J—Instructor Evaluations

43. Purpose. Instructor evaluations are essential in assessing the quality of instructor
performance and providing constructive feedback to improve training delivery. These
AETCI36-2202 23 MAY 2012                                                                     33


evaluations ensure instructors apply effective teaching methods and techniques as well as
guarantee overall consistent training delivery. Instructor evaluation requirements apply to
instructors of all services unless an MOA specifies different requirements.
44. Types of Evaluations:
   44.1. DELETED.
   44.2. Scheduled. A scheduled evaluation is an instructor evaluation conducted according to
   the schedule described in paragraph 46. The scheduled evaluation demonstrates sustained
   mastery of the teaching methods and techniques and qualification to continue teaching
   without assistance. Conduct the scheduled evaluation on at least one of the course or courses
   in which an instructor is qualified for the scheduled period. Do not use a scheduled
   evaluation to satisfy a follow-up evaluation requirement.
   44.3. Follow-up. A follow-up evaluation is an instructor evaluation conducted when an
   instructor is rated as needs improvement (NI) on any one or more items during an evaluation.
   Conduct the follow-up evaluation within 30 calendar days of the initial evaluation. Follow-
   up evaluations do not count as a scheduled evaluation.
   44.4. No-Notice. A no-notice evaluation is an instructor evaluation performed outside the
   schedule described in paragraph 46. All instructors are subject to no-notice evaluations by
   higher headquarters inspectors, the instructor supervisor, or other personnel designated in
   writing by the squadron or group commander to perform evaluations. No-notice evaluations
   will not count for scheduled requirements.
   44.5. Master Instructor. A master instructor evaluation is an instructor evaluation
   performed to determine qualification for master instructor award. Evaluation is conducted by
   personnel outside the training squadron as designated by the training group. Master
   instructor evaluations will not count for scheduled requirements.
45. Conducting Evaluations:
   45.1. Use the AETC Form 281 to conduct an instructor evaluation. Use AETC Form 281 to
   evaluate Air Force instructors who teach other service’s courses, when feasible. This form
   provides greater consistency in evaluations used for master instructor and other instructor
   recognition programs.
       45.1.1. Include evaluation of proper application of motivational training procedures in
       Section E of the AETC Form 281, as applicable.
       45.1.2. Use caution when adding additional items in Section E of the AETC Form 281 to
       avoid inconsistency within the group. Do not add items that can be measured in other
       sections of the form or unnecessary items that simply inflate the overall rating.
   45.2. The squadron commander designates, by memorandum, all squadron personnel
   authorized to conduct instructor evaluations.
   45.3. The instructor supervisor performs scheduled evaluations. In the event the instructor
   supervisor is unavailable, an instructor supervisor from another section or other designated
   personnel will conduct the evaluation. Note: Instructor supervisors cannot perform
   instructor evaluations while in student instructor status (reference paragraph 15.3.).

   45.4. Evaluations of instructor supervisors and intermediate supervisors will be conducted
   by personnel higher in the chain of command as designated by the squadron commander.
   45.5. All personnel conducting evaluations within technical training environments must be
   trained to evaluate instructor performance and to document the evaluation on the AETC
   Form 281 by attending either the Training Supervisor course or an Instructor Evaluation
   Seminar. Attachment 6 provides a guide to conducting instructor evaluations and rating an
   instructor’s performance.
   45.6. Evaluations will be conducted in a typical classroom or laboratory setting. Avoid
   evaluating course orientations and other nontechnical subject areas. Evaluations should last
   at least 50 minutes to provide a comprehensive evaluation. Avoid repetitive evaluations of
   the same lesson.
   45.7. Feedback to the instructor should be constructive              and    provide   specific
   recommendations for improvement, when necessary.
   45.8. If evaluation ratings are below satisfactory or include areas rated as needs
   improvement (NI), the instructor supervisor will take appropriate actions to provide
   instructional improvement and/or additional training.
46. Evaluation Schedule: Instructors, instructor supervisors, and intermediate supervisors will
receive three scheduled evaluations; 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days from the initial qualification
date. Conduct an annual evaluation within 365 days of the initial qualification date. Thereafter,
evaluate no later than every 365 days from the last annual evaluation date.
   46.1. Maintain Schedule Interval. Maintain the evaluation schedule as closely as possible
   for the first three scheduled evaluations to satisfy the teaching internship requirements.
   46.2. When deviations from the schedule are necessary due to temporary duty (TDY), leave,
   or other unforeseen circumstances, document the reason for the deviation. Note: If
   deviations from the schedule will result in a CCAF instructor exceeding 365 days from the
   last annual evaluation, remove the instructor from the assigned course(s).

Section K—Instructor Professional Development and Continuation Training

49. Professional Development. Instructors are at the core of the technical training teaching-
learning continuum and need to stay current in their area of expertise, expand these areas, and
improve their own skills. CCAF-affiliated schools must provide evidence of ongoing faculty
professional development. Instructors are encouraged to take the initiative in professional
development and to seek advanced degrees and professional certifications afforded to them.
Professional development includes, but is not limited to, completing periodic in-service and/or
continuation training, attending professional workshops, conferences, seminars, and training
sessions in their subject area, pursuing professional certifications in training, such as the CCAF
instructor certification, and pursuing AFSC-specific professional certification, such as Airframe
and Powerplant licenses.
   49.1. CCAF Instructor Certification (CIC) Program. The CIC program is a certification
   program for qualified instructors who teach CCAF collegiate-level credit awarding courses at
   a CCAF-affiliated school. The CIC is a professional credential that recognizes the
   instructor’s extensive faculty development training, education, and qualification required to
   teach a CCAF course and formally acknowledges the instructor’s practical teaching
   experience. The program is a three-level program (CIC-I, CIC-II, and CIC-III), in which
   each level consists of increased or advanced requirements and achievements. It is available
   to qualified officer, enlisted, civilian, contract, foreign, and other services instructors. For
   eligibility criteria, documentation, and nomination requirements, consult the CCAF PPG.
   49.2. Instructor of Technology and Military Science (ITMS) Degree Program. ITMS is
   a degree program offered to Air Force and other service enlisted personnel assigned to
   CCAF-affiliated schools teaching CCAF degree-applicable courses.
   49.3. Instructors teaching non-CCAF-credit awarding courses are not eligible for the CCAF
   instructor certification, the ISD certification program, or the ITMS degree program.
50. Continuation Training. Continuation training is essential to the ongoing professional
development of instructors. This training enhances their technical and professional skills and
knowledge in the teaching discipline and training environment. Continuation training
complements initial training by maintaining or expanding individual skills and knowledge and
should be particularly responsive to changes in the unit mission and associated tasks.
Continuation training may come from a variety of sources such as faculty development courses,
college-level adult education courses, college-level academic or technical courses directly related
to the faculty member’s specialty, locally developed in-service training courses, or professional
workshops directly related to the faculty member’s specialty.

   51.1. CCAF Instructors. CCAF-accredited continuation training will be automatically
   recorded in the CCAF STARS student record and displayed on the Courses Attended tab of
   the STARS-FD instructor record. The instructor supervisor will record non-CCAF
   accredited continuation training and training received from other sources (see paragraph 66.)
   in the Local Training tab of the STARS-FD instructor record.
   51.2. Non-CCAF Instructors. Document all continuation training and professional
   development for non-CCAF instructors on the Courses Attended tab in STARS-FD or on
   AETC Form 10.
52. Responsibilities:
   52.1. Training groups or wing will:
       52.1.1. Establish, fund, and maintain equitable professional development programs for
       all instructors. These programs include, but are not limited to, attendance at subject-
       matter specific conferences and professional workshops, training seminars on new
       technology, and subscriptions to subject-matter specific professional journals and
       literature.
       52.1.2. Ensure necessary continuation training courses are available and continuation
       training requirements are met.
       52.1.3. Establish procedures for documenting non-CCAF continuation training.

   62.1. Professional Development. Support personnel must keep abreast of new training
   technologies and instructional design methodologies by attending conferences and
   professional workshops, reading professional journals and literature, and attending training
   seminars on new technology applications. They must understand the advantages and
   disadvantages of each technology and methodology, how these technologies and
   methodologies could apply in their respective training subjects, and when new technologies
   will be available for field use. This knowledge is imperative to ensure educationally sound
   and cost-effective training is developed.
       62.1.1. Support personnel are encouraged to take the initiative in professional
       development and to seek advanced degrees and professional certifications afforded to
       them such as the CCAF Instructional Systems Development (ISD) certification.
       62.1.2. Instructional Systems Development (ISD) Certification Program. The ISD
       certification program is a CCAF program for qualified course/curriculum developers who
       are formally assigned to CCAF-affiliated schools to develop, write, and manage CCAF
       collegiate-level courses/curriculum. The purpose of the certification is to formally
       recognize the CCAF course/curriculum developer’s extensive training, education,
       qualifications, and experience required to develop, write, and manage CCAF curriculum.
       It is available to qualified officer, enlisted, civilian, contract, foreign, and other service
       personnel. For eligibility criteria, documentation, and nomination requirements, consult
       the CCAF PPG.
   62.2. Continuation Training. Continuation training is essential to the ongoing professional
   development of support personnel. This training enhances their technical and professional
   skills and knowledge in the training environment. Continuation training for support
   personnel is strongly recommended.
63. Training Documentation. Document the training needs assessment and completed training
for support personnel according to local procedures.
64. Responsibilities:
   64.1. Training groups or wing will:
       64.1.1. Establish, fund, and maintain equitable professional development programs for
       all support personnel. These programs include, but are not limited to, attendance at
       subject-matter specific conferences and professional workshops, training seminars on
       new technology, and subscriptions to subject-matter specific professional journals and
       literature.
       64.1.2. Ensure necessary continuation training courses are available and continuation
       training requirements are met.
       64.1.3. Establish procedures for documenting support personnel training needs
       assessments and completed training.
   64.2. Supervisors will:
       64.2.1. Assess training needs and plan training for assigned support personnel that meets
       the requirements of the assigned position.
       64.2.2. Schedule personnel for necessary training.
AETCI36-2202 23 MAY 2012                                                                          43


       64.2.3. Ensure training is completed and documented.
       64.2.4. Mentor and encourage subordinates to seek continuation training beyond the
       minimum required training to better prepare the subordinate for future responsibilities.
       64.2.5. Ensure subordinates are afforded a reasonable opportunity to attend continuation
       training.

Section N—Training Sources

65. Primary. Where established, faculty development units within the training groups or wing
are the primary sources of initial and continuation training for instructors, instructor supervisors,
and other support personnel outlined in Attachment 3. Supervisors may seek additional training
sources in order to meet unique training requirements.
66. Other. Training offered by other military installations, DoD agencies, commercial sources,
and colleges or universities may be used to meet initial and continuation training requirements if
required or recommended training is not available from the faculty development units or
supplemented by the Standardized Training and Resources Suite modules. When selecting other
sources for training, supervisors must take into account the most efficient use of training funds
and explore the availability of courses offered through distance learning. Use these sources to
the extent possible as an option for reducing training expenditures. Training groups or wing
must review and approve training options from other sources intended to satisfy the requirements
outlined in Attachment 3 prior to attending training.
67. Geographically Separated Units (GSU). For GSUs, supervisors must determine if the
training needed to perform the job can be obtained at the assigned location. When local training
is not available, supervisors must seek effective and cost-efficient sources for satisfying the
training needs.
68. Catalog of Available Faculty Training. The Education and Training Course
Announcements (ETCA) list available training conducted by faculty development units.
Supervisors may consult with their local civilian personnel office, education services office, as
well as other agencies in the local area for training offerings that may meet job-related needs of
their faculty and staff.
