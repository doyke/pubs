3. Recalls.
     3.1. Recall Methods.
        3.1.1. Overt Recall Procedures: All available means to recall personnel should be
        utilized, to include Giant Voice, Commander Access Channel (CAC), telephones, radios,
        speaker-equipped vehicles, etc.
            3.1.1.1. Osan Commander’s Access Channel (CAC) - Channel 13: During duty
            hours, 51 FW/PA is the primary Point of Contact (POC) for the CAC. After duty
            hours, 51 FW/OC is the POC. When directed by 51 FW/CC, 51 FW/OC will take
            ownership of the CAC.
        3.1.2. Covert Recall Procedures: Use only telephone, encrypted radio or face-to-face
        contact to recall personnel. Do not use Giant Voice, unencrypted radios, CAC, speaker
        equipped vehicles, etc.
        3.1.3. Comm-out Recall Procedures: Recall base personnel when all communication
        systems are inoperative or cannot be used. 51 FW/OC on-duty controllers will contact 51
        SFS to assist. The SFS member(s) will report to the Command Center and, using recall
        rosters and checklists provided, physically contact the required individuals. As a last
        resort, the 51 SFS will send a representative to the Command Center to retrieve the recall
51FWI10-403 25 OCTOBER 2012                                                                  5


     rosters and checklists. When all contacts have been made, the 51 SFS member will
     report back to the Command Center.
  3.2. Types of Recall.
     3.2.1. Level 1 (General Recall): The objective of a General recall is to posture for
     immediate action. Unless otherwise directed, all personnel immediately available will be
     contacted. 51 FW/OC will query the commander initiating the recall on whether
     personnel on TDY, leave, pass, or mandatory crew rest should also be contacted. Unit
     commanders will determine whether assigned personnel all immediately report for duty
     or enter planned contingency work schedules. Personnel reporting for duty will proceed
     without delay in MOPP Level Zero (0) to their primary contingency duty location unless
     otherwise directed. Units will complete their recalls and report personnel strengths
     through their respective UCC to the Emergency Operations Center. Personnel unable to
     perform duty (e.g., hospitalized, on quarters) may be skipped at the discretion of unit
     commanders.
     3.2.2. Level 2 (CAT-Only Recall): Used to immediately recall 51 FW leadership needed
     to assess a crisis situation. CAT composition is defined by 51 FWI 10-401, Crisis Action
     System (FOUO). When directed, 51 FW/OC will recall CAT personnel. As needed,
     additional recalls (51 FW/PA, 51 FW/JA, 51 OG/OGI, 51 SFS/CC, 731 AMS/CC,
     AFOSI/CC, and 35 ADA/CC) may also be initiated at 51 FW/CC discretion. 51 FW/OC
     will query 51 FW/CC on whether personnel on TDY, leave, pass, or mandatory crew rest
     should be contacted. 7 AF Battle Watch Duty Officer (BWDO) will be notified of any
     CAT recall. Unless otherwise directed, personnel will report to the primary contingency
     duty location without delay in MOPP Level 0.
     3.2.3. Level 3 (CAT/EOC Recall): Used to immediately recall the CAT and EOC during
     a contingency/crisis situation. CAT and EOC composition is defined by 51 FWI 10-401.
     When directed, 51 FW/OC will recall CAT personnel and initiate the recall of EOC
     personnel. As needed, additional recalls (see Figures A2.1 and A2.2) may be initiated or
     omitted at 51 FW/CC discretion. Unless otherwise directed, personnel will report to the
     primary contingency duty location without delay wearing field gear and in MOPP level
     Zero (0).
         3.2.3.1. The EOC recall roster will be maintained and updated by the EOC Manager
         with ranks, names, duty/home phone numbers, addresses, and cell phone numbers.
         Current copies of the roster will be kept by the appropriate deputy commanders (or
         24-hour work centers). Work centers responsible for providing EOC personnel will
         ensure the information for their EOC representatives is updated monthly.
         Additionally, work centers will inform the EOC Manager of TDYs, leaves/passes, or
         recall changes due to reassignment or PCS. The most current copy of the roster and
         changes will be passed to 51FW/OC. See Attachment 2 of this instruction for the
         standard EOC recall format.
     3.2.4. Level 4 (Accountability Recall): Used for assessing personnel accountability and
     to relay any instructions. Units shall make pyramid notifications, relay instructions and
     report personnel accountability through their respective UCC. Unit commanders will
     determine if interrupting crew rest is appropriate. Skipped personnel on crew rest will be
 6                                                            51FWI10-403 25 OCTOBER 2012


        counted as contacted. Personnel are to report for duty at the next regularly scheduled
        time, unless directed otherwise.
4. Pyramid Recall System.
     4.1. The 51 FW/OC will devise procedures and terminology to be used in each type of recall
     described in paragraph 3 of this instruction.
     4.2. When directed by 51 FW/CC, 7 AF/CC, or a tenant unit commander (or designated
     alternates), 51 FW/OC will initiate the required recall type using one of the recall methods
     described in paragraph 3 of this instruction.
     4.3. In an actual crisis or emergency situation, it may be necessary to recall associate and
     attached units at Osan. Recall for these units will be initiated by the “Parent” unit tasked in
     Attachment 3. Associate and attached units are responsible for providing their “Parent”
     agencies with current recall rosters.
5. Personnel Strength Reporting.
     5.1. Personnel strength reporting is implemented in conjunction with the RST. All units
     must coordinate with their respective CAT/EOC representative to obtain the RST. UCCs are
     required to report personnel strength data at recall start time plus 60, 90, and 120 minutes
     (units must have a minimum of 80 percent present for duty strength numbers NLT RST plus
     2 hours). This information will be up-channeled from the UCCs to the respective ESFs
     within the EOC. The ESFs will relay strength numbers to the 51 FSS EOC representative
     (ESF 6). ESF 6 will provide 51 FW/CC with a status update for accountability obtained at
     RST plus 60, 90, 120, and 180 minutes and a final report after all units are complete.
     5.2. UCCs will provide EOC with the information defined in sections 5.2.1 - 5.2.5. Unless
     reporting by secure means, do not associate reported numbers with the terms defined below.
     Personnel Readiness Flight (PRF) will provide guidance for reporting recall status. The
     following definitions apply:
        5.2.1. Present for Duty: Total number of personnel who have reported for duty.
        5.2.2. Assigned: Total number of personnel currently assigned to the unit as reflected on
        the Unit Manning Personnel Roster (UMPR).
        5.2.3. TDY: Total number of personnel on Temporary Duty.
        5.2.4. On Leave: Total number of personnel on leave.
        5.2.5. Other: Sum of the numbers of personnel who are dead, missing or have been
        hospitalized.
     5.3. Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) will comply with their local recall procedures.
     GSUs will report to 51 FW/OC and their parent headquarters with the initiation of any recalls
     that have not been directed by the 7 AF/CC or 51 FW/CC.
