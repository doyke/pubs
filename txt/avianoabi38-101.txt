This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 38-2, Manpower. It establishes policies
and procedures for administering the Base Detail Program and assigning details. It applies to all military
personnel assigned or attached to Aviano Air Base, Italy. All groups and associate/tenant units will per-
form an equitable share of details. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this
publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of
Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located
in Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS): https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61/
afrims/afrims/index.cfm. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office
of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication;
route through the appropriate chain of command.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Updates paragraph 2.1.,
responsibility of the program has been delegated to the 31st Fighter Wing (31 FW) Command Chief
(31FW/CCC). Adds paragraphs 3.1., 3.1.1., 3.3., 3.4. and 4.4.


1. GENERAL.
   1.1. The purpose of the detail program is to provide manpower for work requirements or short-term
   events that organizations are unable to support utilizing their current manning. Before requesting
   manpower assistance from the detail program, consideration must first be given to use of extended
   duty hours, shift-work and utilization of manpower from the functional elements within the requesting
   organization or group. Assigning personnel to duties other than their primary duties will be done only
   as a last resort. Base details are considered to be any type of duty that benefits the base populace as a
   whole. Commanders must make every effort to reduce or eliminate base details.

    1.2. Typing and secretarial support for inspections, boards, panels, etc., is the responsibility of the
    office of primary responsibility (OPR) for the inspection, board, panel, etc.

2. RESPONSIBILITIES.
    2.1. The 31st Fighter Wing Command Chief (31 FW/CCC) is responsible for implementing the pro-
    gram. The 31 FW/CCC is the approving official, levying official and exemption authority for all wing
    details.
    2.2. The 31st Fighter Wing Information Management Section (31 FW/CCEA) oversees the base
    detail program.
    2.3. The OPR for the detail is responsible for coordinating any special requirements (i.e., a request for
    special driving qualifications such as forklift qualifications, semi-tractor trailer qualifications, etc.).
    2.4. Each group is responsible for tasking their individual squadrons, providing names to the detail
    point of contact (POC), and maintaining a matrix which details a fair share over quarterly periods.

3. PROCEDURES.
    3.1. Units will submit requests using the detail request memorandum (Attachment 2). Detail requests
    will be completed by the OPR, coordinated through their Group (GP) Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM)
    and submitted to the Base Detail Program Manager via e-mail 31fw.command@aviano.af.mil. To the
    maximum extent possible, detail requests will be submitted no later than three weeks prior to the
    effective date of the detail to allow the tasked unit(s) time to identify tasked personnel. In worst case
    scenarios, detail requests may be submitted no later than two weeks prior to the effective date of the
    detail should scheduling conflicts occur between the Contracting Agent (31 CONS, 31 CES/PMO)
    and the contractor. Requests submitted with less than two weeks notice will result in possible schedul-
    ing delays by the tasked unit(s). If the authority for a detail is regulatory, a copy of the page or para-
    graph of the regulation/instruction needs to accompany the detail request memorandum.
       3.1.1. Taking into account each group’s personnel assigned and number of details previously per-
       formed, the 31 FW/CCC will directly task groups. Fair share percentages are based on the groups
       respective target population (E1-E6) vs. total population. Every reasonable attempt will be made
       to keep the strength percentage and the details performed percentage the same. While numbers
       tasked to groups cannot be exactly fair-shared for every detail, the fair-share percentage over
       annual periods will represent an overall fair-share distribution among the groups. NOTE: Groups
       are identified as 31 FW (includes tenants, Comptroller Squadron ( CPTS), and Weapons Storage
       Area (WSA)), Medical Group (MDG), Mission Support Group (MSG), Maintenance Group
       (MXG), and Operations Group (OG). The 31 FW Vice Commander (31 FW/CV) will be notified
       when the Wing is tasked more than 15% of it’s total workforce.
       3.1.2. 31 FW/CCEA is responsible for maintaining a matrix/spreadsheet of all details fair shared
       percentages per GP. At the beginning of each calendar year MXG will receive less recurring detail
       taskings than the other 4 GPs in anticipation of supporting the majority of the secure area escorts
       details (see para 4.4. for further clarification).
    3.2. Tasked groups are responsible for tasking their squadrons and providing names of the individuals
    that will perform the detail to the detail OPR.
AVIANOABI38-101 16 MAY 2008                                                                               3


  3.3. If the detail OPR encounters any problems with the detailees or there is a no show, the OPR
  should contact the executive officer (CCE) or chief enlisted manager (CEM) of the Group identified
  to fill the detail. Group CCE/CEMs should work closely with their squadron section commanders/first
  sergeants when tasking members.
  3.4. Detailees will return to their duty sections when the detail is completed unless otherwise directed.
  3.5. Exemption requests are sent through the base detail manager to the 31 FW/CCC for approval.
  Requests for exemptions must contain complete justification. Exemption requests will be resubmitted
  annually for re-evaluation. Tasked organizations are still responsible for assigned detail taskings until
  exemptions are approved.

4. TYPES OF DETAILS.
  4.1. The 31 FW supports four types of details:
     4.1.1. Special Duty Details. These details are performed on a one-time basis for a short period of
     time. Examples of special duty details would be: setting up for a special event (i.e., FW/CC Call,
     facility grand opening or distinguished visitor assistance).
     4.1.2. 31 FW Approved Recurring Details. A complete list of 31 FW approved recurring
     details can be found at Attachment 4.
     4.1.3. Secure Area Escorts: Requirements for secure area escorts must be validated by the 31
     MSG/CEM prior to being submitted to the Base Detail Program Manager. Majority of the secure
     area escort details will be tasked to MXG until their fair share percentages are equal to the other
     GPs. Once MXG’s fair share totals have caught up to the other GPs, the balance of the secure area
     escorts requirements will be distributed fairly to each GP.
     4.1.4. Assignment of Inquiry or Investigating Officials. These are only considered details if
     the authority clearly states that the wing or installation commander must appoint these officials.
     Otherwise, these officials must be obtained from other areas within the squadron or group as spec-
     ified, determined by, or appointed by governing directives.

5. FIRST TERM AIRMEN’S COURSE (FTAC).
  5.1. FTAC will support the base beautification detail when five or more students are enrolled.
  5.2. FTAC will not support the Noncommissioned Officer (NCO) position of the base beautification
  detail.
  5.3. When FTAC has an excess of five students, the students can be pooled, with the FTAC Team
  Leader’s permission, for further wing details (i.e., contractor gate escort, postal, etc).
  5.4. Forms Adopted: AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.
