   MANAGEMENT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS, NUCLEAR COMPONENTS, AND
                          SPARES

2.1. Management of Nuclear Weapons.
   2.1.1. Broad guidance on nuclear weapon stockpile quantities is provided by various
   documents (e.g. New START, START I, Presidential Decision Directives, Nuclear Posture
   Review, etc.). The DoD and DoE prepare, coordinate, and deliver the Nuclear Weapons
   Stockpile Memorandum (NWSM), which contains the Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Plan
   (NWSP), to the President. The President then signs a NWSP which directs quantities and
   types of nuclear weapons in the active and inactive stockpile. The President, through the
   SECDEF and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, entrusts the stockpile to various Services
   for employment as requested/directed by combatant commanders (e.g. USSTRATCOM,
   EUCOM), based on their missions and use in execution of war plans.
   2.1.2. AFNWC/NCL is the Service Logistics Agent (SLA) for all nuclear weapons assigned
   to the Air Force. They ensure stockpile quantities align with the NWSM, and are available to
   meet mission requirements, logistics plans, and other stockpile management requirements
   using the following methods: directing inspections and maintenance of nuclear weapons
   and/or components within the scope of approved technical procedures; scheduling weapon
   movements through the NOSS to ensure all weapons are at the proper location in adequate
   quantities; determining the best storage locations for active and inactive reserve weapons;
   and directing charge code changes through either the NOSS or other means (e.g., SLT/SFT
   Warning Orders/Material Transfer Order (MTO)). Note: AFNWC/NCL will request all
   MTO from DTRA using the NOSS module or MTO request module in DIAMONDS.
   2.1.3. AFNWC/NCL provides DTRA Long- and Short-Range Stockpile Management Plans
   necessary to achieve end-of-year actions required to meet NWSM requirements.
   2.1.4. AFNWC/NCL, in coordination with DTRA SLA, is responsible for maintenance
   management of retired weapons stored at the AFMC MUNS.
2.2. Management of Nuclear Components.
   2.2.1. The AFNWC/NCL will develop the Annual Fiscal Year LLC Forecast for the Air
   Force. The AFNWC/NCL will coordinate with the MAJCOMs and provide forecasts to
   DTRA NLT 1 April. Once approved, this forecast becomes the Fiscal Year LLC support
   schedule for the AF, and subsequent Time Change Item Schedules will reflect its contents.
   Proposed changes to the annual schedule will be coordinated IAW paragraph 2.2.1.1.
      2.2.1.1. Replacement LLCs are force shipped to Air Force units having custody of
      weapons to allow maintenance actions to be accomplished prior to LLC expiration dates.
      Units may complete LLC exchanges up to six months prior to expiration date within
      limitations of scheduled LLC replacement support. MAJCOMs may request alternate
      support schedules from the AFNWC/NCL. Changes to the annual schedule must be
      submitted NLT than 90 days prior to date required. MAJCOMs will review schedules
      quarterly and provide AFNWC/NCL any required changes; negative input is required.
      The requests may represent one-time requirements (i.e., early support of items to align
 16                                                         AFI21-204 28 AUGUST 2014


      system due dates, or to allow units to deconflict maintenance schedules), or may be
      ongoing projections to optimize unit maintenance scheduling and workload leveling.
      2.2.1.2. Requests for early support in excess of times specified in T.O. 11N-100-2,
      Supply Management of Limited Life Components, require waiver by DTRA. MAJCOMs
      forward waiver requests to the AFNWC/NCL. Requirements for timely return of expired
      LLCs in TO 11N-100-2, Supply Management of Limited Life Components, apply
      regardless of requests for early support or alternate support schedules.
2.3. Management of Containers and Bolsters.
   2.3.1. Containers and bolsters are used to support storage, maintenance, and logistics
   movement of weapons and components. In addition, WR containers and bolsters are used to
   support storage and movement of TYPE trainers.
   2.3.2. Containers and bolsters are accounted for IAW procedures in AFI 21-203, Nuclear
   Accountability Procedures, and reported IAW 11N-100-4, Custody, Accountability, and
   Control of Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear Materiel.
2.4. Management of Nuclear Training and Test Items.
   2.4.1. Nuclear Bomb Dummy Units (BDUs) and TYPE Trainers will be managed using
   procedures in AFI 21-201, Conventional Munitions Maintenance Management. In addition,
   TYPE trainers containing SS material must be reported IAW T.O. 11N-100-3150, Joint
   Reporting Structure, Nuclear Weapons Reports, chapter 4.
   2.4.2. Items supporting operational/developmental testing programs (e.g., Joint Test
   Assemblies (JTAs), Compatibility Test Units (CTUs), Radar Test Units (RTUs), etc.) are
   managed and accounted for IAW procedures in AFI 21-203, Nuclear Accountability
   Procedures and in some cases reported IAW 11N-100-3150, Joint Reporting Structure,
   Nuclear Weapons Reports, on a QAST Status Reports (QSR). These items are force-shipped
   to units on an as-needed basis.
      2.4.2.1. Maintenance and handling procedures for JTAs are provided in the weapons
      specific -1 manual. These procedures may be utilized for Developmental Joint Test
      Assemblies (DJTA). When procedures in the -1 manual are not adequate, Special
      Procedures (SP) will be developed and provided to field units, as applicable. Minor
      differences for DJTAs, such as markings and configuration changes may be addressed in
      the Test Plan and not require an SP.
      2.4.2.2. Air Force units supporting and/or conducting nuclear weapons test and
      evaluation will ensure compliance of non-nuclear assurance program IAW T.O. 11N-
      T569-2, T569 Non-Nuclear Verification Tester with Non-Nuclear Assurance Program
      Field Procedures.
   2.4.3. SFT selections made within the Air Force will be selected and managed by the
   AFNWC/NCL in consultation with the applicable MAJCOM. SLT selections are made by
   NNSA. The AFNWC/NCL will provide selection candidates to NNSA as required.
   Selection of candidates is formalized by inclusion in the NNSA New Material Stockpile
   Evaluation Schedule (NMSES). The NMSES is the source document to authorize charge
   code changes for QART weapons, these actions will be directed by the AFNWC/NCL.
AFI21-204 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                       17


2.5. Management of Retrofit Kits.
   2.5.1. AFNWC/NCL determines retrofit kit requirements. Kits are normally forced-shipped
   to units based on quantities of items that the unit possesses requiring the retrofit.
   AFNWC/NCL works with the applicable organizations to determine kit distribution. Charge
   code changes may be directed to manage retrofit selections. Kits are maintained and
   accounted for IAW the procedures in AFI 21-203, Nuclear Accountability Procedures.
   Retrofits will be scheduled, monitored and reported by the unit Plans and Scheduling
   function.
2.6. Management of Funds.
   2.6.1. DoE manages funding for First Destination Transportation of nuclear weapons,
   components and Base Spares to or from DoE facilities. Second Destination Transportation
   (SDT) funding for nuclear weapons and components and other items transported by Prime
   Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF) missions or NNSA’s Office of Secure Transportation are
   forecasted by the AFNWC/NCL. MAJCOMs provide projections of movement requirements
   to the AFNWC/NCL as requested. AFNWC/NCL, in turn, develops funding requirements
   and forwards them to HQ AFMC/LSO.
   2.6.2. The AFNWC/NCL funds procurement and transportation for Military Spares and DoE
   designed Air Force test and handling equipment. These items are requisitioned IAW T.O.
   11N-100-1, Supply Management of Nuclear Weapons Material, are free issue, and are
   shipped without charge to the units. The AFNWC/NCL provides reimbursement to DoE.
2.7. Management of Nuclear Weapons, Nuclear Components, Air Force owned DoE-
designed Special Equipment and Base or Military Spares.
   2.7.1. DoE and the AFNWC/NCL manage all items unique to the Air Force nuclear weapons
   program, by their application or initial design. Materiel required for support of the Air Force
   nuclear weapons programs fall into three categories: Base Spares, Military Spares, and DoE-
   Designed Special Equipment (see definitions for specific examples).
   2.7.2. DoE funds and furnishes Base Spare items to the Air Force for maintaining war
   reserve weapons and equipment. Do not use Base Spare items for other purposes unless
   authorized by AFNWC/NCL through the applicable MAJCOM or UR. Do not use Military
   Spare items to maintain war reserve weapons and equipment.
   2.7.3. AFNWC/NCL funds and furnishes Military Spare items to the Air Force for
   maintaining DoE-designed and Air Force owned TYPE 3 trainers and Special Equipment.

    NUCLEAR WEAPONS TRAINING, QUALIFICATION, AND CERTIFICATION
                           PROGRAMS

3.1. Nuclear Weapons Training Program (NWTP). OO/MX SUPT is responsible for
establishing, implementing, and sustaining an effective NWTP. The NWTP ensures highly
qualified supervisors and technicians are readily available to sustain the maintenance
requirements identified in the MCL. A NWTP provides core knowledge on assigned weapons
systems and associated maintenance policies via initial/recurring nuclear weapons academic
training program. NWTP instructors ensure the development of standardized training outlines
used for qualification and certification, utilizing MAJCOM approved training outlines. They
ensure individuals are JQS qualified prior to certification. 2M0 ICBM missile maintenance
training completed in accordance with AFI 21-202 Vol 2, Missile Maintenance Management,
complies with this requirement.
   3.1.1. The OO/MX SUPT appoints instructors to establish, implement, and sustain the
   NWTP. Appointed individuals will be qualified and certified (as applicable) on all tasks they
   train. NWTP instructors/trainers are subject to trainer proficiency evaluations (TPE)
   identified in AFI 21-200, Munitions and Missile Maintenance Management, Chapter 8. If a
   NWTP instructor/trainer fails or is overdue their semiannual TPE, the individual is restricted
   from performing unsupervised training.
   3.1.2. NWTP training outlines will contain as a minimum:
       3.1.2.1. Training title.
       3.1.2.2. Student instructional material.

       3.1.2.5. Instructional guidance.
   3.1.3. For assistance in writing training outlines, contact the local logistics training flight.
   Refer to AFMAN 36-2234, Instructional Systems Development. The OO/MX SUPT is the
   final approval authority for unit produced training outlines. Initial and recurring training
   outlines may be combined.
3.2. Nuclear Weapons Academics. All 21M/2M0/2WX personnel assigned nuclear weapons
duties (example: TMs, TCs, BCs, instructors, evaluators and personnel appointed to intervene
during maintenance) are required to complete initial and recurring weapons academic training,
OO/MX SUPT will determine if any other positions require training. 2M0 ICBM Missile
Maintenance training complies with this requirement.
   3.2.1. Initial weapons academic training must be completed before a member can be
   considered fully qualified or certified.
   3.2.2. Recurring weapons academics training will be administered annually not later than the
   end of the month in which initial training was conducted. Overdue academics training does
   not automatically decertify individuals from performing certified task, but should be
 20                                                              AFI21-204 28 AUGUST 2014


   accomplished as soon as possible. Academics training may be included as part of training
   and recertification for failed technical operations.
   3.2.3. Individuals must complete a test with a minimum score of 80 percent. A test score of
   less than 80 percent requires retraining and retesting with a different test.
   3.2.4. Document initial and recurring weapons academic training in IMDS.
   3.2.5. Weapons academics course control documents will be tailored                   to   unit
   mission/contingency needs and, as a minimum, cover the following items:
      3.2.5.1. Applicable nuclear weapons/system capabilities, periodic             maintenance
      requirements, accountability, inventory, and reporting requirements.
      3.2.5.2. Nuclear weapons systems fault isolation, troubleshooting, and emergency
      procedures.
      3.2.5.3. Authorized maintenance procedures and security requirements in bays,
      structures/cells, protective aircraft shelters and WS3 vaults.
      3.2.5.4. Aircraft/ICBM generation requirements/timelines, if applicable.
      3.2.5.5. Logistics movement requirements (PNAF, Safeguards Transporter (SGT), DoE
      contracted aviation).
      3.2.5.6. Higher headquarters inspection requirements.
      3.2.5.7. Overview of applicable AFIs, WSSRs, weapons system technical orders, and
      local operating procedures.
      3.2.5.8. Missile/explosive safety, nuclear surety, NWRM, Intrinsic Radiation, and
      Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) training may be combined with weapons academics
      training.
3.3. Nuclear Weapons Qualification Program. All 2M0/2WX unit personnel, regardless of
duty position, who evaluate or perform certifiable nuclear weapons maintenance, weapons
mate/demate, weapons handling, and final assembly tests must be JQS qualified.
   3.3.1. Qualification training will be scheduled and conducted in dedicated facilities/training
   areas.
   3.3.2. Trainers will use the CFETP Master Task List, standardized training outlines, and
   applicable technical orders to JQS qualify technicians on certifiable tasks.
   3.3.3. Qualification will be documented in applicable CFETPs or TBA.
3.4. Nuclear Weapons Certification Program. The requirements in this publication
supplement Quality Assurance guidance identified in AFI 21-200, Munitions and Missile
Maintenance Management, as they apply to specific unit mission.
   3.4.1. Certification, as used here, is a term that applies to nuclear weapons maintenance,
   mate/demate, handling, and final assembly test operations. The certification program is a
   requirement over and above the qualification and certification procedures contained in AFI
   36-2201, Air Force Training Program, and AFI 36-2232, Maintenance Training, and takes
   precedence over all other publications in the area of nuclear weapons certification and
   evaluation.
AFI21-204 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                     21


       3.4.1.1. The purpose of the certification program is threefold; it will ensure:
          3.4.1.1.1. All certifications are conducted using nuclear weapons trainers.
          3.4.1.1.2. Technicians performing nuclear weapons tasks understand and use proper
          technical data, maintenance procedures, and techniques.
          3.4.1.1.3. Only certified technicians are permitted to perform nuclear weapons tasks
          (maintenance, mate/demate, handling, and final assembly checkout) on WR weapons.
   3.4.2. Technicians must complete weapons academic training, applicable safety training, and
   be JQS task qualified prior to initial task certification.
   3.4.3. Certification is limited to those items on which the technician is qualified.
3.5. Certifying Officials. (For tasks identified in paragraph 3.8).
   3.5.1. The 2WX7X and 2M07X QA are nuclear weapons certifying officials by virtue of
   position and need not be appointed. If necessary, the OO/MX SUPT may appoint, in writing,
   additional technically qualified certifying officials for the following tasks:
       3.5.1.1. 2M052 for RS mate/demate and weapons handling tasks.
       3.5.1.2. 2M07X for select mate/demate tasks, and weapons handling tasks.
       3.5.1.3. 2WX71 for weapons handling tasks.
       3.5.1.4. 2W271 for weapons maintenance, mate/demate, handling, and Reentry System
       Test Set (RSTS) / Safety Enhanced Reentry Vehicle Field Test Set (SFTS) / Reentry
       Field Support Equipment (RFSE) checkout tasks.
   3.5.2. Personnel assigned Certifying Official responsibilities as defined in this AFI will be
   JQS qualified on the specific nuclear weapons, weapons systems, nuclear reporting, CDS,
   and Permissive Action Link (PAL) procedures as they apply to the task being evaluated. The
   individual must be capable of accurately observing job performance and identifying
   deviation from established standards.
   3.5.3. Prior to performing certifications, the QA superintendent, Chief Inspector, MX/SUPT,
   or Flight Commander/Flight Chief will ensure Certifying Officials are JQS qualified on the
   task to be evaluated and have a current Evaluator Proficiency Evaluation (EPE) while
   performing a personnel evaluation (PE). All certifying officials must receive a semiannual
   EPE on a PE. If a certifying official is overdue the semiannual personnel EPE, the individual
   is restricted from performing certifications until another EPE is completed. QA maintains
   initial and current EPE documentation for all certifying officials.
   3.5.4. Certifying Officials will not certify themselves.
   3.5.5. Certifications will only be accomplished while observing actual task performance.
   Certifying Officials will not be part of the task being performed.
   3.5.6. Certify technicians to perform or direct nuclear weapons maintenance, mate/demate,
   and final assembly checkout tasks as TC, TM, Work Cage (WC), Diving Board (DB), or Top
   Side (TS). Technicians certified in the TC position may perform as TMs. Technicians must
   perform the entire operation to include all documentation required for the task.
 22                                                              AFI21-204 28 AUGUST 2014


   3.5.7. Certify technicians to perform transfer and transport tasks. All personnel certified on
   transfer and transport tasks must be able to demonstrate proficiency in all tasks areas that
   individual is qualified to perform. This includes use and application of all associated
   technical data.
   3.5.8. Certify weapons maintenance tasks by weapon type and task performed (e.g., B61
   General Maintenance (GM), B61 LLCE, etc.).
   3.5.9. Separate certification is not required for nose and tail removals, LLC removal,
   Parachute (PC) removal, weapon demate from launch gear and equipment, demate RV, RV
   disassembly, demate aft shroud, or RS demate from MGS, provided the individual is certified
   on the applicable installation, mate, or assembly procedure and is appropriately JQS
   qualified.
   3.5.10. CDS recodes, activation, and Strike Enable Plug (SEP) removal or installation do not
   require certification. Individuals need be JQS qualified only.
   3.5.11. H1616, H1700 and 9-gallon drum operations do not require certification. Individuals
   need be JQS qualified only.
   3.5.12. PAL/CMS TMs do not require certification; individuals need be JQS qualified and
   the training must be documented in the CFETP or TBA. PAL TMs are authorized to open
   and close access doors, connect/disconnect PAL/CMS cables and adapters, and perform
   visual monitors provided these items are included in PAL/CMS training.
   3.5.13. Personnel involved in a one-time handling and movement of non-assigned weapons
   such as PNAF contingency, DoE SAFE HAVENs, etc., must be transfer and/or transport
   certified and qualified to operate required equipment (tow vehicle, forklift, etc.) needed to
   support the mission. Technicians do not require JQS qualification on non-assigned weapons.
   This is the only exception to normal nuclear weapons certification and JQS qualification
   requirements. Personnel involved in a one-time handling and movement of non-assigned
   weapons must have current technical data available and they must review and understand the
   procedures prior to operation.
3.6. Certification Requirements.
   3.6.1. Weapons maintenance, mate/demate, handling, and final assembly checkout task
   certifications will be performed using the following guidelines:
      3.6.1.1. Certifications may involve any procedures that are authorized to be performed
      by that certification IAW paragraph 3.8. of this instruction. Certifying officials should
      vary what is demonstrated from certification to certification and limit “standard
      certifications” as much as possible to prevent technicians from being “trained for the
      certification.”
      3.6.1.2. Abbreviated operations for the purposes of recertifying personnel are not
      authorized. Additionally, multiple TC certifications must be performed as separate,
      complete start-to-finish operations (i.e. one TC will not disassemble the weapon and a
      second TC reassemble it).
      3.6.1.3. All certifications will include a sufficient number of exercise injects in the form
      of defect analysis and written situational scenarios to provide the certifying official an
      accurate assessment of the scope and completeness of training and the crew’s proficiency
AFI21-204 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                          23


      during actual task performance. Certifying officials will avoid an excessive number of
      injects during the evaluation. The number of inject scenarios per certification will be
      coordinated through OO/MX SUPT and spelled out in the Maintenance Standardization
      & Evaluation Program.
          3.6.1.3.1. Inject scenarios will exercise the team’s ability to emergency situations,
          detect and properly evaluate defects, and their in-depth knowledge of all technical
          data procedures applicable to that certification.
          3.6.1.3.2. Each GM and LLCE TC certification will involve at least one inject
          scenario driving the initiation of a UR against the weapon to verify the crew’s ability
          to generate accurate reports.
      3.6.1.4. A certification is considered a normal evaluation in regards to all the evaluation
      rules provided in AFI 21-200, Munitions and Missile Maintenance Management, with the
      exception that certifications will not be counted against QA’s required PE totals in the
      QA database. All certifications will be scored and documented as “Non-Rated” tasks
      regardless of whether or not it was a pass or fail certification. Follow established Group
      routing procedures for certification reports.
          3.6.1.4.1. Certifications may be rated "fail" even if established Acceptable Quality
          Levels (AQL) are not exceeded, based on the Certifying Officials assessment of
          technical proficiency. Certification attempts that are not successful will be treated as
          training operations and documented as a non-rated evaluation. The evaluation will
          not be scored against established inspection and evaluation requirements.
          3.6.1.4.2. A separate PE will be scored on certified personnel who are on a crew with
          an individual undergoing a certification. The PE may be captured on the same report
          as the initial certification provided the QA database allows for individual
          pass/fail/non-rated ratings. In this case, the overall report will be indicated as
          pass/fail and the individuals undergoing the initial certification will have a rating of
          non-rated. In addition, if the certified personnel commit an error, series of errors, or
          did not detect an error committed by others that they were in a position to have
          detected, they themselves may be decertified using the guidance in this chapter.
          3.6.1.4.3. Decertification rules provided in this chapter will apply when a certified
          TM commits errors while undergoing a TC upgrade certification. As a result of
          failing the TC upgrade certification, the technician will also be decertified as a TM
          based on their committed error(s).
      3.6.1.5. If decertified on either transfer or transport, subsequent recertification will occur
      on the specific operation the individual was performing when decertified.
3.7. Certification Documentation.
   3.7.1. Record certifications and proficiency checks on AF IMT 2435, Load Training and
   Certification Document. Because of the critical nature of the certification, and to avoid
   conflicting certification data, the AF IMT 2435 is to be used as a stand-alone document to
   validate current certification and proficiency status of tasks identified in paragraph 3.8. and is
   not meant to be used for historical purposes. Although documentation of JQS qualification is
   required prior to certification, a discrepancy with JQS qualifications and certification dates
24                                                                AFI21-204 28 AUGUST 2014


  does not invalidate certifications. The certifying official's signature on the AF IMT 2435 is
  the formal act of certification. Automated systems may be used to monitor certifications and
  recurring proficiency checks. Automated systems cannot be used to verify/validate
  certifications. Keep AF IMT 2435 in the individual's work center for easy access by
  supervisors, certifying officials, and dispatchers. No alterations to entries are authorized
  except Block 2. Use Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2 as a guide.
  3.7.2. Complete the AF IMT 2435 in ink or type-written except when use of pencil is
  indicated below:
     3.7.2.1. Blocks 1-4, self-explanatory (Block 2 in pencil if desired).
     3.7.2.2. Blocks 5-6, not applicable.
     3.7.2.3. Block 7; enter weapon type and task as listed in paragraph 3.8 or as directed by
     MAJCOM. Enter “TC”, “TM”, “TS”, “WC” or “DB” for appropriate team position.
     3.7.2.4. Blocks 8-11, self-explanatory.
     3.7.2.5. Block 12; enter the information from block 7 plus the current year. Enter a “C”
     for certified, a “P” for proficiency checks, a “D” for decertification, or an “X” (in pencil)
     for proficiency check due date, under the corresponding month, year, and task.
     3.7.2.6. Transcribe AF IMT 2435 by copying the applicable information from Blocks 1
     through 8 and Block 12 of the old form to the new form. Enter "Transcribed" in Block
     11 of the new form. Flight Chief or above enters a statement on the new form attesting to
     the accuracy of the transcribed entries (see figure 3.1) then signs his/her name, enters
     rank and dates the entry. Destroy original AF IMT 2435.
         3.7.2.6.1. Carry forward the last proficiency check or certification date (if no
         proficiency checks have been performed since certification) accomplished for each
         certified task.
         3.7.2.6.2. Due to decertification then subsequent recertification, if the recertification
         date of any prerequisite task (i.e., B61 GM, 4 Dec 13) is after the certification date(s)
         for any subsequent tasks (i.e., B61 LLC, 12 Jul 13), enter the original GM
         certification date (5 Jul 13) in block 8 on the line as the task. Enter the recertification
         date on the line immediately below the original date. The word TRANSCRIBED will
         be placed in block 11 on the same line as the recertification date. In this case,
         proficiency checks do not need to be carried forward.
  3.7.3. Section/Element NCOIC, Flight Chief, OO/MX SUPT or higher will decertify
  individuals for the following reasons:
     3.7.3.1. Failure to perform required proficiency check.
     3.7.3.2. Failure to demonstrate required technical proficiency. Demonstrating lack of
     technical proficiency to such a degree that the task being evaluated cannot be completed
     without direct supervisory intervention. This does not include abnormal conditions
     requiring supervisory assistance.
     3.7.3.3. Failure to use the required technical data during weapons maintenance,
     mate/demate, handling, or final assembly checkout tasks (e.g., no book or checklist or
     wrong book or checklist).
AFI21-204 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                    25


      3.7.3.4. Technicians failed to detect a safety or reliability deficiency in the weapon,
      component, or support equipment.
      3.7.3.5. Upon upgrade certification to the TC position, decertify the individual from the
      TM position if certified in a TM position on the same task.
      3.7.3.6. Committing procedural errors that, if not corrected, would likely result in an
      unreliable weapon, unsafe environment, or insecure environment. This includes violation
      of weapon system safety rules.

       inspection, preparation for strike, preparation for storage, preparation for shipment,
       sealing warhead container, bomb nose and/or tail removal/installation and transferring
       items to/from maintenance stands, alternate storage containers or out-of-container storage
       configuration. It also includes movement by hand of weapon/RS and stacking/bolstering
       operations.
          3.8.1.1.1. GM certification allows technicians to perform any authorized
          maintenance, other than parachute exchange, not entailing disassembly of the
          warhead (e.g., removal of a major bulkhead or pressure cover allowing access to
          internal components).
          3.8.1.1.2. GM certification is required prior to certification on any other weapons
          maintenance task. When GM certification is a prerequisite for certification on any
          other task, it is specifically identified in the task description. GM or LGM
          certification is not required for any weapons handling task. When technicians
          upgrade from TM to TC position, GM or LGM, as applicable must be the first task
          upgraded.
          3.8.1.1.3. Decertification on GM does not necessarily require decertification on any
          other task(s). However, the technician will not perform those tasks until recertified
          on GM. Note: TCs decertified on GM may not perform in a TM position on any
          other task on the same weapon system until recertified on GM.
       3.8.1.2. Limited General Maintenance (LGM). This task is weapon type specific and
       authorizes personnel to perform any external maintenance required for GM certification

AFI21-204 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                      29


      topside handling (certifications on one RS type is required and JQS qualification on the
      others).
          3.8.3.1.1. Movement of a weapon by forklift/jammer is considered a transfer
          operation provided the weapon is not moved from one established exclusion area to
          another (e.g., forklifting a weapon off of a staging trailer and moving to a second
          trailer for tie-down on the Hot Cargo Pad, forklifting an H1388 out of a storage igloo
          and up onto a trailer, or lifting an Overland Palletized Unit Shipper (OPUS) overpack
          with a forklift and transferring it onto an H1703).
      3.8.3.2. Transport. Certification allows a technician to perform pre- and post-tow
      procedures, visual monitor/safety checks, and operate a tow vehicle or forklift
      transporting nuclear weapons within the limits of JQS qualifications. Personnel must
      have a valid operator’s permit and be JQS qualified on the tow vehicle or forklift
      checkout and operation, trailer checkout and pre-tow inspections, operating tow vehicle
      with trailer, and post tow inspection for each tow vehicle or trailer utilized. Formal
      certification is only required on first tow vehicle; JQS qualify individuals on all
      subsequent vehicles/trailers.
          3.8.3.2.1. Transport certification does not authorize an individual to install/remove
          tiedown devices, however, transport certified personnel must be able to ensure the
          load is secure and safe to transport.
          3.8.3.2.2. During transport certification, the operator must demonstrate an
          understanding of and ability to operate all levers, switches, gauges, etc. Operator
          must demonstrate proficiency in vehicle operation while towing a trailer. Units will
          develop a course to test the operator’s ability to turn (right and left), stop in an
          emergency, and back a loaded trailer.
          3.8.3.2.3. Certification is accomplished using the largest, fully loaded, transportable
          package (e.g., launcher, pylon, etc.) the operator is qualified to operate within the
          assigned work center. If an individual subsequently qualifies to operate a larger
          package, a new certification for that operation must be accomplished. If applicable,
          include CDS procedures as part of initial transport certification.
   3.8.4. Final Assembly Tests.
      3.8.4.1. RS Electrical Checkout. This certification allows a technician to perform
      electrical checkouts using the RSTS/SFTS or RFSE. RS Electrical Checkout certification
      is accomplished using both the RSTS and SFTS or RFSE. The RSTS/RSTC portion of
      the certification will be performed by observing one of the following: checkout of the
      arm/disarm device, electronic command signals programmer, targeting function, or chaff
      subsystem. The SFTS/RSTC portion of the certification will be performed by observing
      one of the following: fuze-set and verify or Pre-Arm D1/D2. Certification using one RS
      type constitutes certification for both if JQS qualifications are met.
3.9. Nuclear Weapons Proficiency Checks.
   3.9.1. Nuclear weapon proficiency checks will be accomplished at least quarterly for each
   certified task an individual is certified on.

  3.9.2. A JQS qualified QA, BC, Critical Task Supervisor, Section/Element Supervisor, or
  Flight Chief will conduct proficiency checks.
  3.9.3. Proficiency checks may be accomplished during maintenance on WR weapons, in
  conjunction with a PE or during a higher headquarters evaluation or inspection.
  3.9.4. Proficiency checks will be performed on positions certified (e.g., TC, TM, diving
  board, work cage, etc.).
  3.9.5. Proficiency checks must be accomplished prior to the end of the third month . For
  example, the last proficiency checks for B-61 LLC was accomplished in July 2014, the next
  proficiency check must be accomplished NLT the last day of October 2014.
  3.9.6. Proficiency checks as it pertains to this publication are not synonymous with AFI 21-
  200, Munitions and Missile Maintenance Management, required personnel proficiency
  evaluations (PPEs). A proficiency check may be considered/evaluated as a PPE if the
  member is performing in the position certified.

         NUCLEAR WEAPONS MAINTENANCE AND HANDLING POLICIES

4.1. General Policies. The policies below are applicable to all maintenance personnel who
maintain, mate/demate, handle, checkout, or store nuclear weapons or TYPE 3 trainers. If there
is a conflict between the policies below and other directives notify the OPR of this publication
for resolution.
   4.1.1. Maintenance Capability. (T-2).
       4.1.1.1. All levels of supervision will continually monitor shift manning/scheduling,
       equipment requirements, and will effectively schedule additional duties, leave, training
       and work details to provide maximum capability and minimize work force degradation.
       4.1.1.2. Train and certify sufficient personnel to meet mission requirements outlined in
       the MCL. Units are prohibited from performing WR maintenance when they are below
       their MCL minimums, Group commanders may waiver this requirement to meet mission
       needs. However, the Group commanders must notify the applicable MAJCOM; the
       notification must include the reason for falling below MCL and specific
       actions/compensatory measures that are in place to minimize the impact on maintenance.
       Also, include projected “get well” date and ensure applicable AFI 10-201, Status of
       Resources and Training System, reporting is accomplished.
       4.1.1.3. LLCE and PC exchange certification is mandatory only if assigned weapons are
       within 3 months of required maintenance.
   4.1.2. Maintenance, Storage, and Configuration.
       4.1.2.1. Keep nuclear weapons and warheads in fully assembled configurations except
       during maintenance or as otherwise directed by appropriate agencies or when allowed by
       Technical Guidance or disposition instructions. Submit requests to the applicable
       MAJCOM for deviations to storage configurations.
       4.1.2.2. Store nuclear weapons only in approved structures and configurations. (T-0).
       Do not co-mingle nuclear and non-nuclear munitions/missiles (e.g., TYPE
       trainers/shapes, JTAs, Training Ferry Payloads (TFP), empty missiles/containers,
       CALCM/ALCM Test Instrumentation Kits (CATIK), etc.) in the same storage structure,
       cell, or WS3. Only as a last resort and with written MAJCOM approval may assets be
       co-mingled.      All non-nuclear munitions/missiles will be identified using
       stanchions/cones, ropes, and placards to ensure there is a clear distinction between
       nuclear and non-nuclear munitions/missiles. (T-1). Placards must indicate “Trainer”,
       “Empty”, “JTA”, or “CATIK”, as applicable.
       4.1.2.3. Non-operational weapons will be identified using placards marked “Non-
       Operational”. (T-1). Make identification readily visible and do not remove until the
       status is changed or immediately before logistics movement. If a storage structure or cell
       contains all non-operational weapons a single placard may be posted at the entrance
       indicating all weapons inside the storage structure or cell are non-operational. It is not
       necessary to open a vault or structure solely for the purpose of installing or removing a
32                                                             AFI21-204 28 AUGUST 2014


     non-operational placard. Establish an Awaiting Maintenance (AWM) action against the
     weapon to install or remove placard during next scheduled opening. (T-2).
     4.1.2.4. Training and/or JTA and WR operations may take place at the same time as long
     as physical separation exists between operations. (T-2). Physical separation must
     include clear delineation between operations using stanchions/cones, ropes, and placards.
     Placards must indicate “Training” or “JTA Operations”, as applicable. In USAFE,
     concurrent operations with training and/or JTA and WR weapons are not authorized in a
     Protective Aircraft Shelter (PAS). (T-1).
     4.1.2.5. Weapons maintenance will have sufficient priority to ensure requirements
     spelled out in T.O. 11N-100-2, Supply Management of Limited-Life Components are met.
     Nuclear weapons maintenance will be completed within 60 calendar days (CONUS) and
     120 calendar days (OCONUS) from receipt of components. Request waivers IAW
     chapter 1 of this Instruction.

     exceed 30 duty days (CONUS) and 60 duty day (OCONUS) following UR and/or DR
     disposition and/or receipt of required replacement parts. Request waivers IAW chapter 1
     of this Instruction.
     4.1.2.7. Cannibalization or interchanging of nuclear weapon components is not
     authorized unless directed in a technical order, UR, or by the AFNWC/NCL.
     4.1.2.8. ICBM units will maintain sufficient RS spares to support operational
     requirements. (T-2). Spares will remain fully assembled and operational, except when a
     configuration change is required to meet mission requirements. Spare systems may be
     rotated into the missile field to enhance flexibility of the wing’s maintenance schedule.
     4.1.2.9. OCONUS units must make every attempt to store WR weapons in a Weapons
     Storage Vault (WSV) at the end of the duty day. (T-3). If a weapon cannot be fully
     reassembled, or cannot be returned to the WSV for any reason, the Group commander
     may authorize temporary storage outside of the WSV as a last resort. Units will also
     notify USAFE/A10N and USAFE/A7SON immediately.
     4.1.2.10. Personnel may perform any inspection, test, or minor maintenance operation
     not involving weapon disassembly, in storage structures, vaults, alert areas, or generation
     areas. Examples include fin replacement, access door panel removal, coding operations
     and opening containers for inventory. Request waivers to this paragraph IAW AFMAN
     91-201, Explosives Safety Standards, and the applicable WSSRs.
     4.1.2.11. Whenever a nuclear weapon is exposed during a maintenance technical
     operation, all visible warhead surfaces will be inspected for defects IAW the applicable
     technical manuals. (T-0). Reevaluate all defects to ensure previously acceptable defects
     are not rejectable because of criteria changes. (T-0). Defects previously accepted IAW
     UR/DR/ETAR responses do not require reevaluation.
     4.1.2.12. Store and/or mark empty weapon storage containers/hand trucks IAW TO 11N-
     35-51, General Instructions Applicable to Nuclear Weapons. (T-0).
AFI21-204 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                   33


     4.1.2.13. Nuclear weapons storage locations and maintenance bays must contain a
     thermometer if the types of weapons stored are required to comply with weapon
     temperature stabilization. (T-0). This includes weapons storage vaults and WMTs.
     4.1.2.14. In nuclear weapons maintenance facilities, display a sign/placard indicating
     Two-Person Concept is required (e.g., “No-Lone Zone Two-Person Concept Mandatory”)
     at the entrance to the maintenance bay, when applicable. (T-0). Signs are not required in
     storage facilities, PASs or for outside operations.
     4.1.2.15. When WR weapon(s) are exposed in the maintenance bay or PAS and
     maintenance personnel are present, secure the personnel entry door from inside. (T-0).
     Advance Entry Control System units are exempt from this requirement; however, the
     maintenance bay door must be closed. If not possible, a two-person team will control
     entry. SVA will approve all entry into exclusion areas. (T-0).
     4.1.2.16. There are no JNWPS periodic inspection requirements for nuclear weapons.
     However, ensure weapons are stored in a safe and reliable configuration and in
     accordance with applicable directives (i.e., properly grounded, chocked, immobilized).
     (T-0). Ensure weapons have proper spacing, storage compatibility, and are within
     explosive and active material limits. (T-0).
     4.1.2.17. If defects are discovered on weapons, components or equipment during walk-
     throughs, ensure defects are evaluated using applicable technical publication, technical
     order or instruction and ensure appropriate corrective actions are taken. (T-0).
  4.1.3. Receipt/Verification Inspections.
     4.1.3.1. Maintenance personnel perform verification inspections on weapons and
     components IAW applicable 11N series TOs as soon as practical after receipt to verify
     the identity, quantity, and serial numbers with data shown on the shipping document or
     DIAMONDS data. Open shipping containers for this verification; however, do not
     disassemble warhead sections, RVs, or bombs. (T-0). Where weapon disassembly
     would be required, verification requirements can be satisfied by comparing visible
     information on the weapon with corresponding data on the shipping document or
     DIAMONDS data, and weapon history records accompanying the shipment.
     4.1.3.2. During receipt of H1616 or H1700 it is not required to open containers for
     component serial numbers verification. Verify component serial numbers during
     unpacking before use. Both NARS and maintenance personnel will use serial numbers
     and reservoir fill dates on the shipping documentation, DIAMONDS data, and exterior
     tags on containers to report receipt. If a discrepancy is found between the shipping
     documentation, DIAMONDS data, and the container, contact the MAJCOM immediately
     and submit UR IAW T.O. 11N-5-1, Unsatisfactory Reports. Obtain component part
     numbers from the item TO. For DIAMONDS database purposes, if part number suffix is
     unknown use part number plus -XX (Example: 123456-XX). For special instructions for
     shipments between Military First Destinations (MFD) and overseas locations, see TO
     11N-100-3150, Joint Reporting Structure; Nuclear Weapons Reports.
     4.1.3.3. H1616 and H1700 container serial numbers, DOT expiration dates, and content
     condition will be updated in the NMC2 SharePoint Environment as changes occur.
34                                                              AFI21-204 28 AUGUST 2014


     NARS personnel will use expiration dates to ensure assets are not shipped in overdue
     containers beyond the military first destination.
     4.1.3.4. Do not open packaged MC4519 assemblies upon receipt. Item is to be opened
     only by the end user immediately prior to use, as directed by applicable TO procedures.
     4.1.3.5. NARS personnel will perform inspections of spare parts. If spare parts are
     determined to be unserviceable, report IAW T.O. 11N-5-1, Unsatisfactory Reports.
  4.1.4. Defects and Deficiencies.
     4.1.4.1. Stop operations upon the discovery of a defect that causes rejection of a weapon
     or major component, or upon encountering any unknown or unusual weapon or major
     component condition. (T-1). The TC will inform the BC of the situation, who will
     ensure the Nuclear Maintenance Element/Section NCOIC, Flight Chief, and the OO/MX
     SUPT are notified of the condition. A supervisor appointed IAW paragraph 1.4.4.12. will
     make a management decision whether to continue operations based on careful review of
     the facts and circumstances. This approval to continue does not relieve the unit of any
     reporting requirements (UR/Dull Sword). Complete the operation if the weapon is safe
     and no damage will occur. If the decision is made to not continue the operation, contact
     the applicable MAJCOM who will coordinate with the AFNWC/NCL to resolve the
     situation. Direct contact between MAJCOMs or units and other agencies (e.g., Defense
     Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) or Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)) for any
     weapons related technical resolution is prohibited unless directed by the AFNWC/NCL.
         4.1.4.1.1. On site DoE representatives may determine continuation of operation (e.g.,
         PAL operation, defect acceptance) when authorized procedures are not available in
         governing TO. However, unit personnel must report the defect(s) according to TO
         11N-5-1, Unsatisfactory Reports, and/or AFMAN 91-221, Weapons Safety
         Investigations and Reports, as applicable. (T-0).
         4.1.4.1.2. Individuals appointed IAW paragraph 1.4.4.12. are permitted to intervene
         when a rejectable component or weapon is encountered or to evaluate any unknown
         or unusual weapon or major component condition. It allows them to determine if it is
         safe to continue an operation after rejection of a component or weapon. Also, it
         allows them to physically assess (i.e., touch, hold, and manipulate) and inspect
         weapons, components, the weapon system, equipment, tools, etc. when
         assessing/validating condition/status or otherwise providing assistance.
     4.1.4.2. When technical procedures call for components/parts to be rejected at lowest
     level available in spares, weapons will be placed in non-operational status if the
     component/part cannot be replaced within Nuclear Reporting (NUREP) timelines. (T-0).
     Weapons will also be placed in non-operational status if involved in an accident or
     incident and the condition is unknown (e.g., lightning strike, fire, loss of custody, etc.).
     (T-0).
     4.1.4.3. Non-operational Tools, Test, and Handling Equipment (TTHE) must be returned
     to operational status as soon as possible, not to exceed 30 duty days following UR, DR,
     Dull Sword, Engineering Technical Assistance Request (ETAR), and/or receipt of
     required replacement parts. (T-1).

  4.1.5. Deficiency Reporting. (T-0).
     4.1.5.1. Deficiencies associated with nuclear weapons, nuclear weapon-related items,
     associated equipment/software or technical orders/publications must be reported.
     4.1.5.2. When assistance is required and the problem does not fit into one of the below
     categories use procedures in T.O. 00-25-107, Maintenance Assistance. Use requests
     from T.O. 00-25-107 for problems with maintenance procedures or production that are
     beyond the capability of the maintaining command. Maintenance assistance may take the
     form of emergency maintenance support, technical assistance, or a combination of both.
     4.1.5.3. Use procedures in T.O. 11N-5-1, Unsatisfactory Reports, to report a deficiency
     on DoE-designed nuclear weapons or related components, DoE-designed
     equipment/software, a JNWPS technical order discrepancy/deficiency, or when DoD-
     designed items require evaluation based upon their interface with DoE-designed items.
     Nuclear weapons placed in non-operational status will only be returned to operational
     status when officially directed by AFNWC/NCL or when directed via an assigned DTRA
     UR number.
     4.1.5.4. Use procedures in AFMAN 91-221, Weapons Safety Investigations and Reports,
     to report a safety related accident, incident or deficiency (Broken Arrow, Bent Spear or
     Dull Sword) on items covered in the USAF Master Nuclear Certification List web site or
     T.O. 21M-LGM30F-12-1, Minuteman Nuclear Surety Procedures. Examples include but
     are not limited to general-purpose vehicles, ICBM related equipment, nuclear certified
     aircraft software, two-person concept violations, etc.
     4.1.5.5. Use procedures in T.O. 00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency Reporting and
     Investigating System, to report deficiencies on DoD-designed items.
     4.1.5.6. In certain instances, it may be necessary to submit multiple reports on one
     deficiency. For example:
         4.1.5.6.1. Submit reports IAW T.O. 11N-5-1, Unsatisfactory Reports, and AFMAN
         91-221, Weapons Safety Investigations and Reports, for:
         4.1.5.6.2. A weapon involved in an accident or incident (lightning, vehicle accident,
         loss of custody, etc).
         4.1.5.6.3. Stray voltage from a motor generator.
     4.1.5.7. Submit reports IAW AFMAN 91-221, Weapons Safety Investigations and
     Reports, and T.O. 00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency Reporting and Investigating System, for:
         4.1.5.7.1. A nuclear certified vehicle still under warranty with burnt wire insulation.
         4.1.5.7.2. Chipped ablative material.
     4.1.5.8. Submit reports IAW T.O. 11N-5-1, Unsatisfactory Reports, and T.O. 00-35D-
     54, USAF Deficiency Reporting and Investigating System, for:
         4.1.5.8.1. Rejected warhead and RS components due to deluge dump.
         4.1.5.8.2. Warhead/weapon damage due to hoist failure.
36                                                           AFI21-204 28 AUGUST 2014


        4.1.5.8.3. Steering fails on a newly manufactured/certified forklift causing vehicle
        and weapon damage.
  4.1.6. Maintenance Tasks.
     4.1.6.1. Personnel will not perform WR operations until they complete weapons
     academic training, applicable safety training, and nuclear weapons certification
     requirements IAW Chapter 3. (T-0).
     4.1.6.2. Nuclear weapons operations will be performed by 2M0XX/2WXXX personnel.
     2M0X2s perform RS mate/demate and weapons handling tasks. 2M0X1s perform select
     mate/demate tasks and weapons handling tasks. 2WXXX perform weapons handling
     tasks. 2W2XX perform weapons maintenance, mate/demate, and RSTS/SFTS/RFSE
     checkout tasks. 21MX, 2M0X1 and 2WXXX personnel may perform Permissive Action
     Link/Code Management System operations if they possess the proper clearances and are
     JQS qualified.
        4.1.6.2.1. In circumstances where there are insufficient 2M0XX or 2WXXX
        personnel available to perform the required nuclear weapons operations the applicable
        MAJCOM will designate AFSCs to augment assigned 2M0XX or 2WXXX
        personnel, however, there must be core 2W/2M personnel assigned and available to
        manage and oversee the nuclear operations. In addition to AFSC requirements all
        training, security clearance, PRP requirements, and certification requirements are
        applicable.
     4.1.6.3. A certified TC will direct all certified weapons maintenance, weapons
     mate/demate, and final assembly test operations. (T-0). TCs may not direct multiple
     operations simultaneously. (T-0). MAJCOMs or units may require a TC to direct
     weapons handling tasks performed with WR weapons.
     4.1.6.4. TCs will give team briefings, using verbal demand-response techniques, before
     starting operations involving a WR nuclear weapon or warhead. The briefing must
     include, as a minimum: Description of the task, designation of personnel assigned to the
     task, nuclear surety IAW AFI 91-101, Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety Program,
     necessary safety, emergency, and intrinsic radiation procedures, and the requirement of
     the Two-Person Concept.
     4.1.6.5. When a TC is communicating technical order procedures to technicians without
     physical access to TOs during nuclear weapons maintenance, mate/demate, final
     assembly checkout, and handling tasks, a verbal demand-response technique must be
     used. (T-1). The technique consists of reading the step to be performed, along with all
     notes, cautions and warnings to the technicians performing the work. The performing
     technicians will acknowledge understanding, perform the step, and then verbally verify
     completion to the person reading the steps. The person reading the steps will then check
     off the steps. If technicians are using technical data and checking off steps as they
     perform them (such as cleaning person on LLCE operations), a TC must ensure all steps
     are completed prior to weapon/component reassembly. Note: The above referenced
     operations often require the use of general procedures contained in both Operations and
     Maintenance and Methods and Procedures technical orders (e.g., 11N-35-51, 1-1A-8, 00-
AFI21-204 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                   37


     25-234, etc.). These technical orders do not require verbal demand-response or checking
     off of steps.
     4.1.6.6. If an operation is halted the TC will mark the last step accomplished. (T-1).
     Resume the operation only after reviewing the checklist or technical order in order to
     determine the operation restart point.
     4.1.6.7. ICBM Critical Task Supervisors are required to oversee all RS mate/demate or
     transfer operations involving WR. (T-2). Critical task supervisors are not required to
     oversee transport operations.
  4.1.7. Weapon Movements.
     4.1.7.1. Cover nuclear weapons, TYPE 3 trainers, JTA, compatibility test units (CTU),
     and flight test units (FTU) during all movements (EXCEPTION: Containerized weapons,
     RSs, and Cruise Missiles do not require covers). (T-1). BDUs do not require covers
     except when simulating WR weapons. JTA movements outside controlled areas must
     have appropriate level of security dependent upon security requirements for each JTA,
     CTU and FTU type. (T-0).
     4.1.7.2. US custody of nuclear weapons must be maintained during all aspects of nuclear
     weapons storage, handling and logistics movements. (T-0).
     4.1.7.3. All on-base nuclear weapons movements outside the restricted area must have a
     member serving as a technical and safety advisor. (T-1). The convoy technical and
     safety advisor will be an NCO that is JQS qualified and fully knowledgeable of tiedown,
     transportation, handling, CDS, custody transfer, and emergency procedures as applicable.
     For ICBM RS convoys, the certified PT driver can serve as the technical and safety
     advisor.
     4.1.7.4. Ensure compliance with the movement procedures identified in DoD S-5210.41-
     M_AFMAN 31-108, Vol 1, Vol 2, and Vol 3, Nuclear Weapons Security Manuals.
  4.1.8. Certifying Nuclear Weapons, Nuclear Warheads, and Components Mated to RS
  or Multiple Carriage Launch Gear. (T-2).
     4.1.8.1. Certifying RS and multiple carriage launch gear configurations.
        4.1.8.1.1. When building RS, pylon and launcher prepare a nuclear weapons
        configuration record (previously known as buildup sheet) to reflect the association of
        warhead and component serial numbers to RS, air launched missiles, and the missiles
        or bombs with the pylon or launcher. The maintenance TC responsible for final
        assembly must prepare and sign the nuclear weapon configuration record, and a
        SNCO or officer must visually verify the serial numbers and configuration and certify
        doing so by signing the nuclear weapon configuration record. Both TC and certifying
        individual must initial beside any changes to the record. This certified record
        becomes the source document for tracking the location of weapons and components
        during storage, alert, and aircraft generation.
        4.1.8.1.2. Exceptions to visual verification: it is not necessary to disassemble
        components for the sole purpose of obtaining component data if it is available on
        previous configuration record.
 38                                                             AFI21-204 28 AUGUST 2014


      4.1.8.2. When building a RV prepare a configuration record to reflect the association of
      component serial numbers to RV. The TC responsible for assembly must prepare and
      sign the configuration record and a SNCO or officer must certify the configuration record
      by signing and visually verifying the serial numbers and configuration of the RV. Both
      TC and SNCO or officer must initial beside any changes to the record.
      4.1.8.3. Nuclear weapon configuration records for launchers and pylons will be created
      and verified for both WR and non-WR packages. Clearly mark nuclear weapon
      configuration records for non-WR packages as “NOT WR”.
         4.1.8.3.1. Use the nuclear weapon configuration record as the source document to
         establish the configuration of the RS, pylon, or launcher.
      4.1.8.4. Forward the original certified nuclear weapon configuration record to the
      MASO. Upload RS/RV nuclear weapon configuration records to AFNWC/NIBF
      SharePoint.

      4.1.8.5. Units may elect to report in-hand/on-hand changes to the MASO based on RS,
      launcher, and pylon serial numbers only; however, if they do so, the MASO must
      maintain the certified nuclear weapon configuration record showing the configuration of
      the RS or launch gear at the time of the report for as long as they retain the SCR.
      4.1.8.6. Swap of a single missile on a pylon or launcher, or a single bomb on a launcher
      or loaded combat aircraft.
         4.1.8.6.1. Prepare an updated certified nuclear weapon configuration record.
         4.1.8.6.2. Forward the original of the updated nuclear weapon configuration record to
         the MASO.
      4.1.8.7. During build-up/recycle maintenance, for systems returning to operational status,
      if the previous configuration record is missing information, disassemble the component to
      the point where the information can be obtained. Reject the component if unserviceable.
      EXCEPTION: Electric explosive device, if information is illegible, not available or
      requires removal notify conventional munitions inspector for serviceability validation.
   4.1.9. Trainer Use and Maintenance.
      4.1.9.1. Use TYPE 3 A/C trainers for maintenance and Explosive Ordnance Disposal
      (EOD) training only. (T-1). Do not use these trainers for aircraft or ICBM load training,
      or logistical movement exercises and evaluations without AFNWC/NCL approval. Use
      TYPE 3E trainers, RS/RV trainers (UA/UE), TFPs, or BDUs for this purpose. Trainers
      must be controlled, stored, and secured according to their respective security
      classification. (T-1).
         4.1.9.1.1. Maintain nuclear weapon TYPE 3 A/C trainers to WR standards using
         procedures in T.O. 11N-35-51, General Instructions Applicable to Nuclear Weapons,
         and the applicable weapons manual. (T-0). TYPE 3 A/C trainers used exclusively
AFI21-204 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                    39


          for EOD training will be maintained in a WR configuration and may deviate from
          WR standards with UR approval. Inspect all other nuclear weapons trainers, TYPE
          3E, load shape/trainers as specified in the applicable technical order, not to exceed
          180-days. (T-1). RS (UA/UE) load shape trainers are maintained IAW applicable
          43D-series technical orders.
          4.1.9.1.2. For those trainers not on the weapons maintenance custody account or
          installed in ALCM Interface Test Trainers (ITT), the OO/MX SUPT and owning
          agency will work out a periodic inspection and maintenance schedule to repair
          deficiencies in order to keep the trainers in WR configuration. Use IMDS to track
          inspection and maintenance of trainers.
      4.1.9.2. Units may elect to track deficiencies/historical documentation for TYPE 3E load
      shape/trainers using AFTO Form 244, Industrial/Support Equipment Record, AFTO
      Form 95, Significant Historical Data, or IMDS, as appropriate. An IRC is not required
      on TYPE 3E or BDU load shape/trainers.
      4.1.9.3. Prohibit installation of WR items, components, or materiel on TYPE 3/UA/UE
      trainers unless authorized by technical data or the AFNWC/NCL. (EXCEPTION: Reuse
      of expended or expired Group X items for training is acceptable). Never install training
      items, components, or materiel on WR items. (T-0).
4.2. Waste Management.
   4.2.1. Three basic types of tightly regulated materials can be generated during nuclear
   weapons maintenance activities. These generated materials may become wastes regulated
   either as Resource Conservation & Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous waste, 91b Waste or
   Potentially Mixed Waste. Maintenance personnel will assure that all wastes are properly
   identified, segregated and containerized as the waste is generated and according to the type
   of waste being generated. (T-0). Appropriate precautions to avoid co-mingling of different
   types shall be taken to minimize the generation of Potentially Mixed Waste. (T-0).
   4.2.2. RCRA regulated hazardous waste includes spent and/or expired hazardous materials
   that are available for use or used in the routine conduct of the maintenance activities and
   includes solvent soaked rags or wipes. RCRA Hazardous Waste, however, does not include
   materials that become contaminated by a radioactive source or demonstrate a radioactive
   property. RCRA wastes include items such as un-useable or spent solvents, lubricants and
   paints.
   4.2.3. 91b Waste is generated when a system component is inherently and/or becomes
   contaminated solely by a radioactive source within the contiguous volume where a tritium
   reservoir resides without the introduction of a hazardous material. These wastes include
   items such as compression pads, un-greased O-rings, Kim wipes or Q-tips used to wipe
   internal components without the use of solvents, and expired weapon desiccant.
      4.2.3.1. 91b waste areas for MK12A are: Inside of the associated aft section and inside
      surfaces of the H1223A/B aft bulkhead cover/ring.
      4.2.3.2. 91b areas for the MK21 are: the enclosure formed by the inside of the Warhead
      Electrical System (WES) cap and aft end of the AFA and inside the WES cap.
40                                                            AFI21-204 28 AUGUST 2014


  4.2.4. Potentially Mixed Waste is generated when a 91b Waste is combined with a RCRA
  Hazardous Waste. An example is a Kim wipe, wiper or rag that becomes contaminated with
  spent hazardous material solvent once used to wipe internal components and surfaces of a
  radioactive source.
  4.2.5. Collection and Identification. Local bioenvironmental section may survey and
  perform analysis on hazardous waste containers to determine what type of waste is generated.
  These surveys can be used to reduce the number of containers distributed to maintenance
  activities.
  4.2.6. RCRA Hazardous Waste Management guidance is available through the Installation
  Environmental Flight. Base-wide instructions are also found in the installation Hazardous
  Waste Management Plan (HWMP), which outlines specific procedures for managing
  hazardous waste. Coordinate through the local environmental management flight for
  container turn-in or pick-up and disposal IAW AFI 32-7042, Waste Management. (T-1).
  4.2.7. Package 91b Waste in the smallest plastic bags consistent with the operation being
  performed and store in 30 to 55-gallon drums, label packages and drums “Potentially 91b
  Waste" and coordinate through local bioenvironmental channels for container pickup and
  disposal IAW AFI 40-201, Managing Radioactive Materials in the US Air Force. (T-1). O-
  CONUS units will coordinate pick-up and disposal through MAJCOM.
  4.2.8. Package Mixed Waste in the smallest plastic bags consistent with the operation being
  performed, store in 30 to 55-gallon drums, label packages and drums "Mixed Waste
  Potentially 91b" and coordinate through local bioenvironmental channels for container
  pickup and disposal IAW AFI 40-201, Managing Radioactive Materials in the US Air Force.
  (T-1). O-CONUS units will coordinate pick-up and disposal through MAJCOM.
  4.2.9. Do not store or co-mingle Hazardous Waste, Potentially 91b Waste or Mixed Waste in
  the same package or drum. (T-0).
  4.2.10. Low Level Radioactive Waste (LLRW) programs are driven by environmental
  regulatory compliance and are not a personnel safety issue. Radiation levels are extremely
  low. Waste generated during cleaning of tools used during maintenance is NOT a 91b Waste
  issue. It is not necessary to wear personnel protective or safety equipment while working
  around the gas transfer systems of a weapon within the parameters outlined in the applicable
  technical orders, unless otherwise directed (e.g. cleaning with solvents).
