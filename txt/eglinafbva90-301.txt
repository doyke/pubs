               PREVENTING FRAUD, WASTE, AND
                     ABUSE (FWA)

Fraud is any intentional deception designed to unlawfully deprive the Air Force of
   something of value or to secure from the Air Force for an individual a benefit,
   privilege allowance, or consideration to which he or she is not entitled.


Waste is the extravagant, careless, or needless expenditure of Air Force funds or the
     consumption of Air Force property that results from deficient practices, systems,
     controls or decisions.


Abuse is the intentional, wrongful, or improper use of Air Force resources, such as
    misuse of rank, position or authority that causes the loss or misuse of resources such
    as tools, vehicles, computers, or copy machines.


   1. If you know of fraud, waste or abuse incidents as defined above, report these
      incidents to your commander, Inspector General (IG), Air Force, AFMC, or DOD.

   2. No one may take action against you for making a FWA disclosure. If you feel
      someone has, immediately report his information to your commander or the IG.

   3. For more information on this program, see AFI 90-301, Inspector General
