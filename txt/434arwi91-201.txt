     1.4. Users are directly responsible for the control and use of ammo issued to them for either
     real world or exercise purposes. Accountability of assets, to include expenditures, will be
     validated upon the issue and turn-in of the assets, at the beginning and end of each shift, or
     whenever required to eliminate a discrepancy.
2. Issue, Turn-In, Expenditure, and Controlling Procedures:
     2.1. Issue:
        2.1.1. The procedures for issuing, turn-in, and reporting expenditures are located in

        maintained for a period of 90 days from the date of the exercise termination.
        2.1.4. Once issued to an authorized individual, the ammo may be distributed to those
        persons requiring munitions for training purposes as long as all persons are identified and
        briefed on safety and accountability.
        2.1.5. Personnel and equipment will be inspected to ensure that live rounds of ammo are
        not introduced into an exercise/training environment.
        2.1.6. Units must provide training to emphasize safe handling, weapon operation, use of
        blank and bird control ammo, and operator maintenance. This training should be
