        1.4.1.2. Training time starts with the first significant training event (a training event directly con-
        tributing to qualification and upgrade: computer-based training (CBT) lesson, ground training,
        flight, etc.), or 45 days (ANG: 90 days) after being attached or assigned to the unit, whichever
        occurs first.
        1.4.1.3. Units will notify HQ ACC/DOT (ANG: ANG/XOT) through channels when aircrew
        members exceed training time limits. (Use the waiver format shown in paragraph 1.12.3..)
        Squadron commanders may extend upgrade training time. An extension of training time letter,
        signed by the unit commander, will state the training difficulty, unit corrective action to resolve
        and prevent recurrence, and estimated completion date.
    1.4.2. Mission Qualification Training (MQT). This training includes initial MQT, DQT and RQT
    to initially qualify or requalify aircrew in a specific position and flying duties as related to a particular
    MDS aircraft’s mission. Completion of one of these MQT programs is a pre-requisite for BMC and
    CMR.
    1.4.3. Basic Mission Capable (BMC). An aircrew member who has satisfactorily completed mis-
    sion qualification training, does not maintain MR/CMR status, but maintains familiarization in the
    unit operational mission. The aircrew member may maintain qualification in some aspects of the unit
    mission, and is able to attain full qualification in the unit mission within 30 days, or as otherwise spec-
    ified in this instruction. BMC aircrew members accomplish all mission-related ground training desig-
    nated by the SQ/CC. BMC aircrew may deploy and may participate in any mission for which they are
    proficient and qualified, without additional training. The SQ/CC will determine if additional training
    is required for BMC crewmember before each deployment. Failure to complete BMC required train-
    ing results in regression to Non-BMC (N-BMC) status. N-BMC aircrew may not perform combat
    training without supervision until recertified.
    1.4.4. Combat Mission Ready (CMR). A CMR crewmember is one who has satisfactorily com-
    pleted mission qualification training and maintains qualification and proficiency in the unit opera-
    tional mission. Failure to complete this training or maintain these currencies results in regression to
    Non-CMR (N-CMR) status.
    1.4.5. N-CMR/N-BMC. Aircrews that regress to N-CMR/N-BMC status will comply with Chapter
    2 and Chapter 4.
    1.4.6. Continuation Training (CT). There are two aspects of CT. The first is basic proficiency
    training required to ensure safe operation of the aircraft. The second consists of specific mis-
    sion-related training required to accomplish the unit’s assigned missions.
    1.4.7. Specialized Training. Specialized training is training in any special skills necessary to carry
    out the unit’s assigned missions not required of every aircrew member. Specialized training consists
    of upgrade training for Data Link Operator, Airborne Mission Supervisor, etc. (see Chapter 5), as
    well as some continuation training to maintain proficiency and qualification in unit tasked special
    capabilities and missions. Normally, accomplish specialized training after a crewmember achieves
    CMR/BMC status. Specialized training is normally in addition to CMR/BMC requirements. Unless
    otherwise specified, aircrew in CMR or BMC positions may hold special capabilities/qualifications as
    long as any additional training requirements are accomplished.
    1.4.8. SQ/CCs will determine and assign aircrew members that will train for and maintain special
    capabilities or qualifications.
AFI11-2SENIORSCOUTV1 28 DECEMBER 2005                                                                      9


   1.4.9. Unqualified (UQ). Unqualified aircrew members require additional training and a flight eval-
   uation before progressing to a higher qualification level. They are not authorized to perform any
   flight duty unless under the direct supervision of an instructor/evaluator. UQ aircrew fall under the
   category of personnel: enrolled in MQT, downgraded for loss of currency, downgraded for a demon-
   strated lack of ability, or failure to meet standards during a flight evaluation. See paragraph 1.5.3.2.3.
   for more information.

1.5. Training Concepts and Policies
   1.5.1. Units will design training programs to achieve the highest degree of combat readiness consis-
   tent with flight safety and resource availability. Training must balance the need for realism against the
   expected threat, aircrew capabilities, and safety. This instruction provides training guidelines and pol-
   icies to use with operational procedures specified in applicable flight publications.
   1.5.2. Design training missions to achieve combat capability in squadron-tasked roles, maintain pro-
   ficiency, and enhance mission accomplishment and safety. Training missions should emphasize either
   basic combat skills or scenarios that reflect procedures and operations based on employment plans,
   location, current intelligence, and opposition capabilities. Ideally, use procedures/actions applicable
   to combat scenarios or reconnaissance operations (e.g., appropriate use of code words, authentication
   procedures, combat tactics, tactical deception, in-flight reports, threat reactions, intel briefing and
   debriefing).
   1.5.3. In-flight Supervision
      1.5.3.1. Use flight evaluators and instructors for any phase of training to capitalize on their exper-
      tise and experience.
      1.5.3.2. Instructor Training, Supervision, and Usage
          1.5.3.2.1. Instructors will comply with requirements of this instruction.
          1.5.3.2.2. The following personnel must fly with an instructor:
              1.5.3.2.2.1. All non-current aircrew members.
              1.5.3.2.2.2. All aircrew members in initial, difference, upgrade, or requalification flying
              training. Qualified crewmembers in upgrade training may continue to fly unsupervised in
              their current crew position.
              1.5.3.2.2.3. Unqualified crewmembers as defined in AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew Training, and
              any other staff personnel the WG, OG, or SQ CC designates.
          1.5.3.2.3. Instructors may supervise a maximum of two students on training sorties, with the
          approval of the Operations Officer. Assess the risk before allowing a trainee to fly without
          direct supervision. Risk factors to consider are (but are not limited to): students’ experience
          level, planned maneuvers, and mission tasking. For exercise, contingency, and operational
          missions, a one-to-one instructor to trainee ratio is required. A student on his/her first sortie
          will have direct (one-on-one) instructor supervision at all times.
          1.5.3.2.4. Make every attempt to ensure instructor continuity for crew members in initial, mis-
          sion qualification, requalification, difference training, and upgrade training.
10                                                    AFI11-2SENIORSCOUTV1 28 DECEMBER 2005


     1.5.4. Since the SENIOR SCOUT is a stand-alone weapon system, flight training is not readily avail-
     able. Therefore, the use of simulators and mission trainers is essential to fully qualify SENIOR
     SCOUT crewmembers in all crew positions. The SENIOR SCOUT system, in combination with the
     SENIOR SCOUT Mission Trainer (SSMT), is an authorized simulator for aircrew training, and air-
     crew may use it to credit applicable currency events. These events are listed in Attachment 2. Note:
     Until the SSMT is developed and fielded, units are authorized to utilize the SENIOR SCOUT shelter
     as a simulator. Due to the limited functionality of a grounded SENIOR SCOUT, units may conduct
     initial qualification training/evaluations in the SENIOR SCOUT shelter, but only a restricted AF
     Form 8 may be issued. Full qualification requires an airborne check ride. Once SSMT is fielded and in
     use, this note becomes void.
     1.5.5. Do not require aircrew members to accomplish ground and/or ancillary training except as
     required by this instruction or AFI 36-2201.
     1.5.6. Due to the unique duties of Cryptologic Operators (COs) various service requirements and
     taskings, COs may be required to obtain multiple qualification in more than one USAF or other ser-
     vice MDS. The 169IS/CC will forward multiple qualification requests to ANG/XO for approval IAW
     AFI 11-202V1 and AFI 11-401. Individuals are required to complete at a minimum all egress, emer-
     gency procedures, life support and qualification training for the MDS they will qualify in.

1.6. Training Records and Reports.
     1.6.1. Units will maintain aircrew records for individual training and evaluations IAW:
        1.6.1.1. AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew Training.
        1.6.1.2. AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program.

        1.6.2.1. Ground training.
        1.6.2.2. Currencies.

1.7. Training Folder Requirements.
     1.7.1. Initiate a training folder for initial qualification, requalification, mission qualification, special
     qualification, difference, upgrade, and additional training directed by the squadron commander or a
     flight examiner. The training folder will include training reports, all waivers and other applicable
     records. Place the training documents in reverse chronological order with the most recent on top.
     1.7.2. The student will hand-carry formal school records to the gaining unit for review and incorpora-
     tion into the individual’s training folder. Classified portions will be sent via courier to gaining unit.
AFI11-2SENIORSCOUTV1 28 DECEMBER 2005                                                                     11


1.8. Training Folder Review: The SQ/CC or designated representative will conduct a review of active
training folders before a flight evaluation needed to complete the training program. Annotate the review
in the student’s folder. Note: Active training folders are folders of crewmembers undergoing initial, mis-
sion qualification, requalification, difference, upgrade, special qualification or commander directed addi-
tional training.

1.9. Training Period Review. Instructors will review training folders before each training period (flight
or simulator) to develop a training plan. After each period, instructors will document training in sufficient
detail to accurately assess student performance and make recommendations for subsequent training. At
the satisfactory completion of all required training, instructors will make a recommendation for an
in-flight evaluation. Students will review and initial training records after each training period.

1.10. History of Training and Documentation Procedures.
   1.10.1. The Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF) has basic source documents that provide a current history
   of each individual’s flying qualification IAW AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation
   Program, AFI 11-2SENIOR SCOUT V2, Aircrew Evaluation, and appropriate MAJCOM supple-
   ment.
   1.10.2. Upon completion of training, place the Summary/Close-Out Report (AF Form 4025) in Sec-
   tion I of the individual’s FEF under AF Forms 942. Return all other records to the individual. See Air
   Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://webrims.amc.af.mil/. Squadrons will
   retain all AF Forms 4022 contents for 1 year, and then return them to the aircrew member. Do not
   insert AF Forms 4022, 4023, or 4024 or training guides into FEFs.

1.11. Sortie Allocation Guidance:
   1.11.1. Currency events required for deploying aircrew members to be fully mission capable to per-
   form their duties on operational sorties.
   1.11.2. FTU syllabus sorties.
   1.11.3. CMR crewmembers
   1.11.4. BMC crewmembers

1.12. Waiver Authority:
   1.12.1. The OG/CC is the waiver authority (ANG: ANG/XOT) for all continuation, specialized train-
   ing (Chapter 5), flying hour requirements for upgrade training, and in-unit training timelines unless
   specifically noted otherwise.
   1.12.2. The OG/CC (ANG: ANG/XOT) may waive MAJCOM-directed ground or flying continua-
   tion-training requirements on a case-by-case basis.
       1.12.2.1. File copies of all waivers in the aircrew training folder.

                                               Chapter 2

                                        FORMAL TRAINING

2.1. General.
   2.1.1. This chapter outlines formal training of aircrew members into the SENIOR SCOUT weapons
   system and includes MQT and DQT normally conducted at the SENIOR SCOUT FTU, Salt Lake
   City, UT. In exceptional circumstances when FTU training is not available within a reasonable period,
   this training may be conducted at the local unit IAW provisions of Chapter 3. Formal training
   includes: initial mission qualification training (MQT), requalification training (RQT), conversion
   training (CT), and difference qualification training (DQT). These formal training programs upgrade
   aircrew to BMC or CMR in order to accomplish the unit’s mission. Some wing, group or unit certifi-
   cation courses may be required to complete qualification training. Special qualifications and flight
   evaluations will be conducted in-unit following completion of the formal course.
   2.1.2. The primary method of qualification training is to attend and complete the appropriate formal
   training course listed in the ETCA, followed by in-unit qualification training, when necessary. Com-
   pleting the appropriate formal course satisfies all qualification-training requirements. Formal training
   may be conducted in operational squadrons IAW provisions of Chapter 3 and with the approval of the
   OG/CC (ANG: ANG/XOT). The in-unit formal training will be conducted using appropriate ANG
   training course syllabus tracks, flow programs, and requirements. Unit training flights will contact the
   SENIOR SCOUT FTU for an approved training program.

2.2. CMR/BMC Certification.
   2.2.1. The gaining squadron commander certifies aircrew members as CMR or BMC when training is
   complete. Document the certification on the unit Letter of Xs.
   2.2.2. A tailored training program will be used to re-qualify aircrew that has regressed from BMC or
   CMR for any reason. This training will specifically address deficiencies which caused regression to
   re-qualify regressed aircrew.

2.3. Prerequisites. Each aircrew member must comply with the appropriate formal course training pre-
requisites prescribed in the ETCA before entering qualification training. All personnel on flying status
(IAW AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew Training) will meet the following requirements before flying. Waiver
authority is HQ USAF CFM (ANG: ANG CFM).
   2.3.1. Physiological training (PP11).
   2.3.2. Flight physical (PP01)

2.4. Ground Training
   2.4.1. SENIOR SCOUT aircrew members will successfully complete the appropriate ETCA formal
   training courses, except as noted in Chapter 3.
   2.4.2. Ground training accomplished during MQT, DQT, or RQT establishes due dates for subsequent
   continuation training.

2.5. Flying Training
14                                                   AFI11-2SENIORSCOUTV1 28 DECEMBER 2005


     2.5.1. Mission sequence and prerequisites will follow the appropriate formal course syllabus.
     2.5.2. Complete training within the time specified by the approved syllabus. Failure to do so within
     the specified time limit requires notification to the crewmember’s MAJCOM/DO with the aircrew
     member's name and rank, reason for delay, planned actions, and estimated completion date.
     2.5.3. The unit(s) must prepare a training program designed to maintain mission qualification and
     prevent regression of proficiency. Squadron-developed training programs should use profiles typical
     of squadron missions.
     2.5.4. Accomplish approved in-unit training according to applicable formal training or approved
     school courseware if available.
     2.5.5. Evaluations are flown IAW AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, AFI
     11- 2 SENIOR SCOUT V2, Aircrew Evaluation Criteria, and local standardization/evaluation criteria
     on a sortie representing the unit’s primary mission tasking.
     2.5.6. Complete all academic training required for qualification before flight evaluation and certifica-
     tion/qualification in the unit operational mission. Note and justify all exceptions in the student’s train-
     ing records prior to flight.
     2.5.7. The SQ/CC may approve initial, difference, requalification, upgrade, or special qualification
     training requirements on operational missions. An instructor of like specialty will supervise students
     on these sorties. Comply with restrictions in AFI 11-220, Reconnaissance Flight Rules and Proce-
     dures (a classified document), and AFI 11- 2SENIOR SCOUT series instructions and specific theater
     OPORDs and directives. Squadron commanders will ensure the training will not affect mission effec-
     tiveness nor expose crewmembers to unnecessary risk.
     2.5.8. Complete all qualification training before the flight evaluation.
     2.5.9. Formal course syllabus, mission objectives and tasks are minimum requirements. Additional
     training events, based on student proficiency and background, may be incorporated into the program.
     Additional training due to student non-progression is available within the constraints of the formal
     course syllabus and may be added at the discretion of the SQ/CC. Complete qualification training les-
     sons in order; however, if mission scheduling or student progress dictates otherwise, the unit com-
     mander or designated training supervisor may change the order. Annotate changes in the student’s
     training folder.
     2.5.10. Flight training events accomplished during IQT/MQT/RQT are not creditable for continuation
     training requirements, but will be used to establish currency. Events accomplished during an AFI
     11-202 evaluation are creditable for continuation training and do establish currency. DQT, Pre-AITC,
     and AITC instructor upgrade flight training events are creditable for continuation training require-
     ments.

2.6. Initial Mission Qualification Training (MQT). Use MQT for qualifying newly assigned crew-
members, or re-qualifying crewmembers that have been unqualified for more than 8 years.
     2.6.1. The SENIOR SCOUT FTU will conduct all initial qualification training, except as described in
     Chapter 3.
     2.6.2. Document all initial qualification training in the individual’s training folder.
AFI11-2SENIORSCOUTV1 28 DECEMBER 2005                                                                   15


   2.6.3. Each crewmember will complete Q003, mission qualification evaluation, following successful
   completion of the initial course.

2.7. Requalification Training (RQT): Use RQT to qualify former SENIOR SCOUT crewmembers that
are returning to fly, or to qualify crewmembers that are unqualified due to loss of currency. RQT will also
be used to requalify aircrew members who have regressed from CMR/BMC for any reason, and such
training must specifically address the deficiencies that caused the regression. Units are allowed to tailor
their regression training program for all aircrew members, based upon qualification, experience, currency,
and documented performance.

2.8. Recurrency Training
   2.8.1. Ground Training Requirements (See Table 4.1.). The aircrew member must accomplish the
   delinquent event(s) to regain currency.
   2.8.2. Flight Training Requirements (See Table 4.2.).
       2.8.2.1. Loss of currency up to 6 months. The aircrew member must demonstrate proficiency with
       an instructor in all delinquent items.
       2.8.2.2. Loss of currency exceeding 6 months. Training as directed by the squadron commander.
       Individuals need to requalify only in events required by their training level. A flight check by an
       evaluator possessing like qualification(s) is required once certified proficient in the non-current
       event(s) by an instructor. Complete a flight evaluation covering the items directed in the training
       program.
   2.8.3. Requalification requirements are as follows:
       2.8.3.1. Unqualified up to 39 months at the end of a non-flying assignment or 48 months at the
       end of any active flying assignment. Complete training in all delinquent items (as applicable),
       additional training as directed by the squadron commander, and a flight evaluation.
       2.8.3.2. Unqualified 39 months at the end of a non-flying assignment or 48 months at the end of
       any active flying assignment to 8 years. Complete the appropriate ETCA requalification academic
       course at the FTU (TX-2 requalification course) and an in-flight evaluation. The requalification
       academic course may be accomplished in-unit, with a waiver from HQ ACC/DOT (ANG: ANG/
       XOT).
       2.8.3.3. Unqualified over 8 years. Complete the appropriate ETCA formal initial qualification
       course. Waiver authority is HQ ACC/DOT (ANG: ANG/XOT).
   2.8.4. Basic and instructor requalification may be conducted simultaneously. Consult AFI 11-202V2,
   Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program and AFI 11-2SENIOR SCOUT Vol. 2, Aircrew Evalua-
   tion Criteria for guidance on simultaneous instructor requalification and basic requalification evalua-
   tions.
   2.8.5. See requalification tables in Chapter 5 for ground and flight training events required for
   requalification. Individuals who have completed a formal instructor course are not required to
   re-accomplish A010, instructor academic training.

2.9. Difference Training/Certification:
16                                                  AFI11-2SENIORSCOUTV1 28 DECEMBER 2005


     2.9.1. Initial Cadre for Change of Equipment or Capability. Difference training is usually conducted
     with the engineering specialists responsible for converting to the new system training (e.g. baseline
     upgrades, minor system upgrades). These personnel will provide difference training for the initial
     cadre whenever possible. Qualified personnel in other units will provide conversion training for the
     initial cadre whenever possible. In some instances, it will be necessary for units to form an initial
     cadre of personnel for whom certain training requirements may be waived. Instructors completing
     difference training will provide DQT to other unit aircrew members.
     2.9.2. The following conditions apply to management of initial cadre aircrew qualification: Form a
     nucleus of instructor and flight examiner personnel (initial cadre) to begin difference qualification.
     Do not designate initial cadre in a crew position higher than currently held unless previously qualified
     in the conversion weapons system. Identify the initial cadre in a letter of appointment signed by the
     ANG/XO.
     2.9.3. The SQ/CC will determine which training events are applicable after examining the training
     and evaluation records of initial cadre.
        2.9.3.1. The SQ/CC will review the proposed training qualification plan and forward a copy to
        ANG/XOTE and ANG/XO before beginning difference training for major system changes.
        2.9.3.2. Crewmembers will complete all academic and ground training events before starting
        flight training on new systems.
     2.9.4. Complete all recommended difference training on any equipment, systems or crew procedures
     prior to evaluation/certification.
     2.9.5. Q004, difference qualification or Q014, difference certification (as applicable) is the squadron
     commander’s certification that all difference training is complete. Unit standardization and evalua-
     tion will document difference qualification in the individual’s FEF. The host unit providing conver-
     sion training will document all conversion training and maintain the training folder until successful
     completion of the training program.

2.10. Instructor Training and Supervision Requirements. All instructors and evaluators must be
graduates of a formal instructor course in order to conduct flight training and evaluation. See Chapter 5.
Waiver authority is OG/CC (ANG: ANG/XOT).

2.11. Formal Training Reports. Feedback is an important tool for academic instructors. FTU and mili-
tary academic instructors will devise and implement student feedback questionnaires. Send the post-grad-
uate training critiques to each student’s unit approximately 60 days after graduation. The student will
complete one critique, with the student’s commander or supervisor completing the other. The unit will

                                    QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. General. This chapter specifies minimum training requirements for qualification and difference
qualification when not completed as part of a formal training program by the SENIOR SCOUT FTU.
Conduct mission requalification training IAW para 2.7. of this instruction.

3.2. General Requirements. The primary method of qualification is to complete the appropriate formal
training course listed in the ETCA. For courses where MQT programs haven’t been developed, provide
MQT instruction IAW in-unit training syllabi until MQT programs at the FTU are established.

3.3. SQ/CC directed MQT applies to all aviators transitioning to a different mission for which they are
not qualified. SQ/CC directed MQT includes as a minimum an Initial Operational Certification (Q011)
and Unit Mission Brief (G330). Additional training will be at unit commander discretion.

3.4. Prerequisites:
   3.4.1. Before entering qualification training, each aircrew member must comply with the appropriate
   formal course training prerequisites prescribed in the ETCA.
   3.4.2. All personnel will meet the requirements listed in paragraph 2.3. before flying.
   3.4.3. Cryptologic Operator requires a 1A8XX, X1N2XX or X1N5XX AFSC and a “3” skill level or
   higher.
   3.4.4. AMTs require a 1A3XX AFSC and a “3” skill level or higher.

3.5. Ground Training. Document MQT not accomplished in conjunction with a formal training course
by opening a MQT training folder when more than Q011 and G330 are required. For MQT involving
only Q011 and G330, accomplish an AF FORM 4023 (file in FEF) and update unit standardization and
evaluation function for inclusion on the letter of certification (letter of X’s). The crewmember is consid-
ered mission qualified when training is complete and the unit commander signs the letter of certification.
   3.5.1. Accomplish academic training as directed in applicable courseware.
   3.5.2. Complete egress and local area survival training before the first flight. Accomplish initial
   egress training on the aircraft.
   3.5.3. Ground training accomplished during initial qualification, difference, or requalification train-
   ing establishes due dates for subsequent continuation training.

3.6. Flying Training. Accomplish approved in-unit training according to published guidance and formal
or approved school courseware if available.

3.7. Conversion Training.
   3.7.1. Conversion qualification is normally associated with training between Mission Design Series
   (MDS). See the note in TTable 1.1. for an explanation of conversion training in the context of this
   instruction.
18                                                AFI11-2SENIORSCOUTV1 28 DECEMBER 2005


     3.7.2. Complete the appropriate ETCA conversion academic course at the FTU (TX-3 conversion
     course) and an in-flight evaluation. The requalification academic course may be accomplished
     in-unit, with a waiver from HQ ACC/DOT (ANG: ANG/XOT).

3.8. Difference Qualification Training (DQT). Use Difference Qualification Training (DQT) to qualify
a crewmember on a different system/baseline change within SENIOR SCOUT. DQT typically only
requires a certification; however, the squadron commander may direct an evaluation for any type of dif-
ference training. Do not use DQT to qualify anyone in a different crew position. Units may conduct dif-
ference training and re-qualification training simultaneously.
     3.8.1. Training section will determine which training events from Attachment 2 are applicable after
     examining the training and evaluation records of each individual. The BMC/CMR items marked in
     the tables are only minimum requirements, the units may decide to increase or add events as neces-
     sary.
     3.8.2. SQ/CC will determine whether Q004 or Q014 is required.
        3.8.2.1. Document Q004 in the crewmember’s FEF. Document Q014 in the unit ‘Letter of Xs’.
        3.8.2.2. Complete all applicable ground and flight instruction involving any equipment, systems
        or crew procedures that differ.

                                   CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. General: This chapter outlines ground and flying training requirements for CMR and BMC aircrew
members. All aircrew members must be qualified IAW AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evalua-
tion Program.

4.2. Ground Training. Aircrew members must attend required training to avoid grounding.
   4.2.1. An individual who instructs a class receives credit for that academic training requirement.
   4.2.2. Ground training accomplished during any phase of qualification training may be credited
   toward continuation training requirements.
   4.2.3. Units are encouraged to combine like courses whenever possible. The time allotted for each
   course listed in the aircrew training syllabus should be used as a scheduling guide. The actual time
   required may vary based upon the needs and experience of the class.

4.3. Failure to Complete Training Requirements.
   4.3.1. Ground aircrew members who fail to complete BMC identified ground-training requirements;
   they will not fly until the training is complete.
   4.3.2. Downgrade aircrew members who fail to complete CMR identified continuation-training
   events to Non-CMR/Non-BMC. They may not fly an operational sortie (local training or exercise sor-
   ties may be flown by Non-CMR/Non-BMC aircrew members.)
   4.3.3. Crewmembers that enter N-BMC/CMR status because of overdue ground training will regain
   BMC/CMR status upon completion of training.

4.4. Ground Training Events. Table 4.1. identifies BMC and CMR continuation training requirements.
Use the legend below to determine the purpose of each column.
   4.4.1. CMR. The CMR assigned crewmembers must complete items marked with an X or the crew-
   member will regress to BMC status.
   4.4.2. GND. All aircrew members must complete items marked with an X or they will be grounded
   until accomplished.

     5.3.4. Instructor Qualifications. Unit commanders will personally review each instructor candi-
     date's qualifications to ensure the individual possesses the following minimum prerequisites:
        5.3.4.1. Instructional Ability. An instructor is a teacher and must understand the principles of
        instruction as outlined in the instructor upgrade courseware.
        5.3.4.2. Judgment. Instructors must possess judgment necessary to meet unexpected or induced
        emergencies and the ability to exercise sound judgment through mature realization of their own,
        their student's, and the aircraft's limitations.
        5.3.4.3. Personal Qualities. The instructor must have patience, tact, understanding, and the
        desire to instruct others. Instructors must have a personality that inspires and wins respect of each
        student.
        5.3.4.4. Technical Knowledge. The instructor must be thoroughly familiar with respective air-
        craft systems and equipment, normal and emergency operating procedures. Additionally, all
        instructors must be thoroughly familiar with the applicable portions of USAF, ACC, and ANG
        flight management, flying training, and flying operations publications.
        5.3.4.5. Flying Experience. Instructors must possess reasonable flying experience to include
        desired standards of skill and proficiency in both the aircraft and assigned missions. Do not accept
        flying hours alone as criteria for selection to instructor.
     5.3.5. Instructor Responsibilities:
        5.3.5.1. General. Instructors will be thoroughly familiar with all courseware and contents of the
        applicable attachments to this instruction for qualification, upgrade, and specialized training they
        are required to administer.
            5.3.5.1.1. Instructors will review the student's training records, to include records of counsel-
            ing and other evaluations or progress indicators, before performing each training flight or ses-
            sion.
            5.3.5.1.2. Instructors are responsible for a thorough pre-flight briefing and critique; they will
            comply with requirements of mission outlines, as appropriate, for the type mission flown.
            5.3.5.1.3. Instructors must ensure all required upgrade training items are completed and
            signed off and that the student has demonstrated the required level of proficiency before rec-
            ommending the student for an evaluation or certifying that the student is qualified.
        5.3.5.2. Instructor Aircrew. Each instructor aircrew member is responsible for the safe execu-
        tion of the duties of their respective crew position. At any time during the flight, if the judgment
        or proficiency of the student should raise a question in the instructor's mind as to the student's abil-
        ity to safely execute the duties of the aircrew position, the instructor will immediately take over
        these duties. The instructor should then explain and demonstrate the proper method of executing
        these duties.
        5.3.5.3. Instructor Deficiencies. Instructors who demonstrate deficiencies in their ability to
        instruct may be used in their primary crew position (provided the deficiency does not involve pri-
        mary crew duties). Commanders will take the necessary action to either retrain or remove those
        individuals from instructor status IAW Air Force, ACC, and ANG directives.
     5.3.6. Instructor Upgrade Prerequisites:
AFI11-2SENIORSCOUTV1 28 DECEMBER 2005                                                                     25


       5.3.6.1. General. Instructors in basic qualification status may keep basic qualification instructor
       status during mission qualification training. However, before they can instruct in mission events,
       they must finish mission qualification training and satisfactorily complete an instructor flight eval-
       uation on a tactical mission. Total flying hour requirements as posted in flying tables are flying
       hours in that crew position.
       5.3.6.2. All initial instructor upgrade candidates must be mission ready in the unit's mission for a
       minimum of 6 months.
       5.3.6.3. Conduct flying training IAW applicable AF Form 4022.
       5.3.6.4. Instructor candidates will complete all academics before the flight phase.
       5.3.6.5. Conduct flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-2SENIOR SCOUT, Volume 2.
       5.3.6.6. May accomplish Instructor requalification events concurrently with basic requalification
       events.
       5.3.6.7. Units are encouraged to use flight evaluators as instructors for qualification training and
       upgrade training programs as required. However, if an evaluator is used as a primary instructor to
       train an individual during a training program, the same evaluator should not administer the evalu-
       ation that completes the training program.
       5.3.6.8. Instructors and evaluators may credit an instructor/evaluator sortie when performing
       instructor/evaluator duties in-flight. Instructors may credit/dual log flying continuation-training
       events when performing training duties.

5.4. The Aircrew Instructor Training Course (AITC). AITC prepares unit personnel for instructor
qualification. AITC attendance is a prerequisite for flight instructor status. Prerequisites and time limita-
tions are listed in the ETCA and this instruction.
   5.4.1. The FTU is responsible for ensuring the initial instructor training is completed. Exceeding the
   specified time requires SQ/CC directed additional training. Failure to complete an initial instructor
   evaluation for any reason requires appropriate action IAW AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Ser-
   vice, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, and AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Pro-
   gram.

                            AIRCREW TRAINING DOCUMENTATION

A4.1. General Information. This attachment provides guidelines on proper training documentation. It
provides instructions for AF Form 4022, Aircrew Training Folder, AF IMT 4023, Aircrew Training
Progress Report, AF IMT 4024, Aircrew Training Accomplishment Report, and AF IMT 4025, Sum-
mary and Closeout Report, and aircrew training guides.
   A4.1.1. Initiate a training folder, AF Form 4022, for ETCA formal training (either at formal school or
   in-unit), mission qualification, special qualification or certification training, in-unit upgrade program
   to the next higher crew qualification, requalification training (either at formal school or in-unit), or for
   any corrective action or additional training. If the training can be accomplished on one mission, a
   training folder is not required.
   A4.1.2. The unit operations officer may waive the training folder requirement if corrective action or
   additional training is limited. If initiated, the instructor or flight examiner who evaluated the aircrew
   member’s performance will enter comments pertinent to the training deficiency on AF IMT 4023 or
   the training guide. Use the existing training folder for end-of-course evaluations that result in addi-
   tional training.
       A4.1.2.1. At the unit's discretion, a combined AF IMT 4022 may be used for an individual under-
       going more than one training program in a short period of time.
       A4.1.2.2. Squadrons will maintain the training folders for their personnel in a location readily
       accessible to instructors and supervisory personnel. The trainee may review his or her folder at
       any time.
       A4.1.2.3. Formal schools will send AF Form 4022 with all training records to the trainee’s gain-
       ing unit. Squadron commanders will review formal school training records and enter appropriate
       comments on the training guide progress record or AF IMT 4023.
   A4.1.3. The instructor or trainer will review the training folder, to include AF Forms 4023 and 4024
   or the training guide, before all training periods (flight or simulator). Note those areas not previously
   accomplished, or those in which crewmembers require additional training, for possible inclusion dur-
   ing the current training period. Operations officers will review active training folders quarterly, and
   flight commanders or squadron training representatives will conduct a monthly review. Annotate
   monthly and quarterly reviews on AF IMT 4023 or in the training guide. Note: Training folders for
   FTU students are exempt from monthly and quarterly reviews.
   A4.1.4. Upon completion of training, place the summary/closeout report (AF IMT 4025) in the indi-
   vidual’s flight evaluation folder (FEF). Return AF IMTs 4023 to the aircrew member. Retain AF
   Forms 4022 and 4024 for contents for 1 year, and then return them to the aircrew member. Do not
   insert AF Forms 4022, AF IMT 4023 or 4024 into FEFs.
   A4.1.5. Unit may overprint versions of AF Forms 4022, 4023, 4024, and/or 4025 in accordance with
   AFI 37-160, Volume 8, The Air Force Publications and Forms Management Program – Developing
   and Processing Forms. ANG must approve overprints.
