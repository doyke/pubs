                                            Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. The Weather Flight serves as the office of primary responsibility for all weather
services supporting IAB and its supported units. This instruction establishes requirements and
outlines duties and responsibilities of the Weather Flight and for reciprocal support requirements
with other IAB agencies.
1.2. Implementation. This instruction covers daily operations to include exercise and
contingency operations. Unless superseded by Emergency War Orders, this instruction will be
followed during wartime operations.
1.3. Concept of Operations. The Weather Flight will provide or arrange all weather services
for units supported by IAB. The Weather Flight leverages the support of the 21st Operational
Weather Squadron (21 OWS) for weather Watches, Warnings and Advisories (WWA),
Meteorological Watch (METWATCH) and resource protection services.
   1.3.1. Delineation of Duties. Air Force Weather provides strategic-, operational- and
   tactical-level weather support. Weather duties are routinely shared between the Weather
   Flight and the 21 OWS. The Weather Flight will provide and/or coordinate weather support
   for IAB.
   1.3.2. Airfield Operating Hours. IAB’s airfield normally does not close. The Weather
   Flight, using the limited-duty operations concept, is manned around the battle rhythm of
   IAB’s primary mission. A continuous, standby presence is maintained via a monthly-
   disseminated recall roster.
   1.3.3. Airfield Closure Hours. During hours of airfield closure, the Weather Flight will have
   personnel on-call to provide weather support for: severe weather events; missions without
   previously-coordinated weather support; weather support equipment outages.
1.4. Transient Aircrew Services. IAW AFMAN 15-129V2, Air and Space Weather
Operations - Exploitation, paragraph 2.4.2, transient aircrew receive flight weather briefings
from the 21 OWS (see paragraph 4.2.). The 28 OWS at Shaw AFB provides transient aircrew
weather briefs in the event of 21 OWS communication outages or evacuations. Aircrews are
provided contact information for the OWSs via Airfield Management Operations, Flight
Information Publications or directly from the Weather Flight.
* Note: Deviation from AFMAN 15-129V2, paragraph 2.4.2.
1.5. Duty Priorities. The duty priorities of the Weather Flight are outlined in Table 1.1. The
priorities were developed IAW AFMAN 15-129V2 and exist to balance manpower with mission-
critical tasks. Duty priorities focus efforts during peak work periods prone to task saturation and
priority conflicts. Weather Flight personnel will use sound judgment when complying with these
duty priorities, especially where there is imminent danger to life and property.

Table 1.1. 39 OS/OSW Duty Priorities.

 Order Of      Duties
 Priority
 1             Complete Emergency War Order Tasks
 2             Execute Weather Flight Evacuation
 3             Enact Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP) Operations, as required
 4             Issue all WWAs, as required, when the capability at the 21 OWS does not exist
 5             Provide Staff Weather Support to Protection Level One (PL-1) Assets/Missions/Exercises
 6             Notify 21 OWS of Aircraft/Ground Emergencies/Mishaps and Request Data Save
 7             Provide “Eyes Forward” / Collaborate with 21 OWS
 8             Respond to Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV) Contacts
 9             Relay Urgent (i.e., UUA) Pilot Reports (PIREP) to 21 OWS during duty hours
 10            Disseminate Routine (i.e., UA) PIREPs during duty hours
 11            Provide or Arrange for Requested Weather Briefings/Reports for IAB missions
 12            Maintain Weather Skills Proficiency Training and Readiness IAW AFI 15-127
 13            Accomplish Administrative Tasks
1.6. Assumption of Duties. Enacted when the 21 OWS is unable to fulfill its primary duties of
issuing WWAs and conducting METWATCH for IAB due to evacuation or equipment failure.
     1.6.1. The Weather Flight will temporarily (i.e., < 72 hours) assume complete weather
     support for IAB from the 21 OWS, to include all forecasted and observed WWAs, until the
     21 OWS is able to resume full-capacity duties.
     1.6.2. For OWS outages exceeding 72 hours, the Weather Flight will contact USAFE/A3W
     who coordinates reach-back or backup weather support for the Weather Flight.
1.7. Alternate Operating Location (AOL). For evacuation purposes, the Weather Flight’s
AOL is building G-95, room 21; telephone numbers are the same as at the primary location. For
operational support, Weather Flight personnel will contact the 21 OWS and the IAB Command
Post (CP) advising of relocation.
     1.7.1. The capability to monitor PMSV does not exist at the AOL.
     1.7.2. The ability to monitor weather satellite and radar, lightning strikes, volcanic eruptions
     and ash clouds, etc. is directly dependent upon dedicated Internet access. When
     communications outages occur, Weather Flight personnel are significantly hindered from
     performing their mission. By using reach-back, telephonic means, the 21 OWS can provide
     weather information for Weather Flight personnel to use. Also, equipment located within the
     Radar Approach Control facility offers a medium to locate clouds, rain intensity and location
     of approaching weather. Additionally, at times, Turkish Internet may not be affected by
     Weather Flight Internet outages. Bilateral cooperation between weather forces on IAB
     allows for yet another means of interrogating and interpreting weather information.
     1.7.3. At the AOL, Weather Flight personnel are highly dependent upon the availability of
     the web-based Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET). JET is the primary means of
     disseminating WWAs.
INCIRLIKABI15-101 14 MARCH 2014                                                                7


       1.7.3.1. During JET outages, a backup means of relaying WWAs to base agencies will be
       utilized (e.g., phone call, radio, runner, etc.). Backup dissemination of WWAs will be
       made to the following agencies, in this order:
           1.7.3.1.1. Air Traffic Control Tower
           1.7.3.1.2. 39 ABW/CP
           1.7.3.1.3. Airfield Management Operations
           1.7.3.1.4. Radar Approach Control
           1.7.3.1.5. 21 OWS (in the event the Weather Flight issues the WWA)
       1.7.3.2. During JET outages and for open-source, worldwide Internet dissemination of
       WWAs, the Weather Flight will send notifications out via AFW-WEBS, 21 OWS, by
       contacting another Weather Flight, or by whatever means necessary.
1.8. Operating Assumptions:
   1.8.1. The Weather Flight assumes adequate resources, communications, personnel and
   facilities will be available to execute all base weather support.
   1.8.2. The 21 OWS assumes adequate resources, communications, personnel and facilities
   will be available to execute the agreements spelled out on the Incirlik Weather Flight Data
   Sheet and there will be sufficient weather information available on which to base weather
   operations and production.
1.9. Release of Weather Data to Non-Department of Defense (DOD) Agencies and
Individuals. Weather Flight personnel occasionally interact with their civilian, Turkish
counterparts. Certain weather information is routinely shared (e.g., climatological information,
weather radar and observation data feeds, etc.). Weather information that is of a sensitive or
classified nature (e.g., aircraft/ground mishaps, mission weather information, etc.) will only be
shared with non-DoD personnel with the expressed approval from the 39th ABW Commander,
IAB Public Affairs and/or IAB Staff Judge Advocate’s office.
1.10. Additional Weather Support. Direct all requests for additional weather support to the
39 OS Commander (39 OS/CC). The 39 OS/CC will arrange or direct services IAW this
instruction, United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE), 3rd Air Force (3AF), AFIs, AFMANs
and AFPD.

2.4. Meteorological Equipment.
   2.4.1. Portable Doppler Radar (PDR). The Weather Flight operates a PDR which provides
   weather radar detection and interrogation of storms that may affect IAB. The Weather Flight
   provides host-nation civilian personnel and the 21 OWS with a data feed from the PDR. If
   the PDR is non-operational, Weather Flight personnel may utilize host nation radar over the
   Internet.
   2.4.2. AN/FMQ-19 Automated Meteorological Station. The FMQ-19 is an integrated
   system of multiple weather sensors and data automation components that continually
   measures environmental conditions to provide responsive, reliable, accurate, real-time
   weather data. The FMQ-19 measures airfield weather conditions to include, but not limited
   to: wind direction, wind speed, present weather, runway visual range, visibility, cloud heights
   (including coverage), temperature, dew point, station pressure and lightning detection. Host-
   nation weather personnel have access to weather data provided by the FMQ-19 and they
   prepare and disseminate the official airfield weather observation for IAB.
   2.4.3. JET is Air Force Weather’s primary communications and computer software system.
   Weather WWAs and pilot reports are created and transmitted using JET. JET hardware and
   software transfers weather data to, and receives data from, weather agencies worldwide via
   the Internet.
      2.4.3.1. In the event of a JET outage, the dissemination of weather WWAs from the 21
      OWS will be limited to fax, e-mail or phone notification to only the agencies listed in
      Table 2.1. If available, WWAs issued by the 21 OWS will continue to be disseminated
      using Integrated Weather Warning Capability (IWWC) and Weather Flight calls are
      considered a backup.

                                    AIRFIELD SERVICES

5.1. Airfield Services. Airfield Services includes weather observing, meteorological watch and
PMSV.
5.2. Weather Observations. HN personnel observe, then record and disseminate the official
airfield weather observation. Weather Flight personnel ensure that the FMQ-19 is properly
functioning for the use of HN weather personnel. ATC personnel will use the FMQ-19 readout
for up-to-the-minute wind data and as a backup to the HN weather observation, if unavailable.
   5.2.1. The FMQ-19 has known limitations. It is unable to detect the weather phenomena
   listed in paragraphs 5.2.1.1. through 5.2.1.6. Weather Flight personnel who observe these
   elements will ensure 21 OWS and HN weather personnel are notified for resource protection
   measures and archive purposes.
       5.2.1.1. Tornadoes
       5.2.1.2. Funnel Clouds
       5.2.1.3. Hail (3/4 inch or greater)
       5.2.1.4. Volcanic Ash
       5.2.1.5. Sandstorms
       5.2.1.6. Snow Depth – Only during Weather Flight operating hours and snow is
       occurring
Note: Immediate reporting of a tornado or funnel cloud takes precedence over other criteria.
   5.2.2. Weather Flight personnel will maintain situational awareness of local weather
   conditions and the FMQ-19 operational status during duty hours. Weather Flight personnel
   will respond to FMQ-19 malfunctions or outages during non-duty hours.
5.3. Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAF).
   5.3.1. HN weather forecasters develop and disseminate the TAF for IAB. HN weather
   practices follow rules outlined by the World Meteorological Organization. TAF details are:
       5.3.1.1. The International Civil Aviation Organization designation for IAB is: LTAG
       5.3.1.2. The LTAG TAF is issued at: 0600Z, 1400Z and 2200Z
       5.3.1.3. The LTAG TAF is accessible via the Internet on open-source websites
5.4. WWAs. The 21 OWS has the responsibility to issue all forecast and observed WWAs for
IAB. The Weather Flight performs the “eyes forward” function and relays pertinent weather
information to the 21 OWS, when observed. Additionally, Weather Flight personnel engage in
meteorological discussions at least once daily with the 21 OWS and during severe weather
events. The Weather Flight issues IAB WWAs when the ability no longer exists at the 21 OWS.
Note: Deviation from AFMAN 15-129V1, Table 4.2, line 9 and AFMAN 15-129V2, paragraph
2.18.

5.5. Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW). The Weather Flight is not responsible for the
official airfield observation; therefore, some requirements stipulated in AFMAN 15-111,
paragraph 2.15. do not apply. IAW AFMAN 15-111, paragraph 2.15.1. and the “eyes forward”
concept, the Weather Flight will relay changes in observed tower visibility versus surface
prevailing visibility to the 21 OWS when tower visibility is less than 4 statute miles and different
from the surface prevailing visibility.
5.6. Meteorological Watch (METWATCH). The term METWATCH is used to provide an
organized approach for weather personnel to maintain situational awareness of both current and
future meteorological situations with the primary focus on un-forecasted changes in the weather.
21 OWS will perform a continuous METWATCH for IAB, with the Weather Flight providing
“eyes forward” support as defined by AFMAN 15-129V2, paragraph 3.1.2. Changes in the
status of weather elements result in notification disseminated from the 21 OWS or Weather
Flight to base agencies.
   5.6.1. The METWATCH process encompasses:
       5.6.1.1. WWA criteria (Tables 5.1. – 5.3.)
5.7. Observed Weather Advisories. A weather message issued when a particular weather
event first occurs and no advanced notice of the weather phenomenon is required.
   5.7.1. Observed weather Advisories are issued when first observed and are valid Until
   Further Notice (UFN). Once the criterion is no longer met, the Advisory will be cancelled.

                                          Chapter 6

                                RESOURCE PROTECTION

6.1. General. This section details actions undertaken by the Weather Flight and 21 OWS to
provide resource protection to IAB through the utilization of weather WWAs.
6.2. Delineation of Duties. The 21 OWS is responsible for issuing all forecast and observed
WWAs for IAB. The Weather Flight provides “eyes forward” for the 21 OWS. In the event of
imminent threat to life and property, the Weather Flight will issue Warnings normally issued by
the 21 OWS. In these cases, the Weather Flight will inform the 21 OWS when time permits and
IAW duty priorities.
Note: Deviation from AFMAN 15-129V1, Table 4.2, line 9 and AFMAN 15-129V2, paragraph
2.18.
   6.2.1. Expanded Eyes Forward. Expanded “eyes forward” support will be provided
   whenever Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP) are utilized. Weather Flight personnel
   will focus on the specific severe weather the SWAP was initiated for.
   6.2.2. For the purpose of informing 39 ABW Leadership with weather situation awareness,
   Weather Flight personnel notify the 39 OS/CC or 39 OS/DO when the following are issued:
       6.2.2.1. Watch or Warning for Tornado
       6.2.2.2. Watch or Warning for Severe Thunderstorm
       6.2.2.3. Watch or Warning for Damaging Winds > 50 knots
       6.2.2.4. Warning for Moderate Thunderstorm
   6.2.3. Weather Flight personnel will enact a continuous weather watch of developing
   weather conditions to aid in performing enhanced METWATCH procedures prior to and
   during the onset of severe weather (i.e., tornadoes, winds > 50 knots and/or hail > 3/4 inch).
6.3. Unit Requirements. Units are responsible for coordinating modifications to, or additional,
WWA support. Requirements must be justified and routed through the 39 OS/CC.
   6.3.1. Customers requesting changes in existing WWA support must validate the
   requirement and provide a list of protective actions taken when the WWA is issued.
   6.3.2. Approved changes to existing WWAs for IAB are coordinated through the 21 OWS
   for inclusion into existing processes. Subsequently, the changes will be implemented to
   provide the appropriate level of resource protection.
6.4. Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP).
   6.4.1. The purpose of SWAP is to provide a means for the Weather Flight to systematically
   and collectively manage additional strains and decision-making processes that accompany
   severe weather. SWAP is a cooperative effort between the 21 OWS and the Weather Flight.
   Each agency has specific roles and responsibilities as defined by AFI 15-128 and AFMAN
   15-129.
   6.4.2. When directed by Weather Flight Leadership, 21 OWS or 39 ABW/CP, the Weather
   Flight will activate the Severe Weather Action Team (SWAT). The SWAT will provide IAB
INCIRLIKABI15-101 14 MARCH 2014                                                             19


  with clear, timely notifications of impending severe weather. The SWAT Leader will recall
  personnel (as needed) to intensify the METWATCH, monitor the PDR and/or issue WWAs.
  6.4.3. SWAP will be implemented and the SWAT will be activated when the following is
  forecast to occur or is actively occurring:
     6.4.3.1. Severe Watch or Warning has been issued for IAB
     6.4.3.2. Anytime the 21 OWS deems SWAP implementation is required in the interest of
     resource protection and/or safety of ongoing operations at IAB
     6.4.3.3. When severe weather has been observed on or within five nautical miles of IAB
     6.4.3.4. Severe weather is defined as:
         6.4.3.4.1. Tornadoes or Funnel Clouds
         6.4.3.4.2. Damaging Winds > 50 Knots
         6.4.3.4.3. Hail > 3/4 Inch
  6.4.4. When issued with sufficient desired lead time, the SWAT will respond two hours prior
  to the expected onset of severe weather or as soon as possible if within the two-hour window.
  6.4.5. Any qualified Weather Flight personnel may determine if the potential for severe
  weather is strong enough to warrant SWAT activation.
  6.4.6. When responding to severe weather, Weather Flight personnel will perform the
  following:
     6.4.6.1. Ensure appropriate WWAs have been issued and received by the following:
         6.4.6.1.1. 39 ABW/CP
         6.4.6.1.2. ATC Tower
         6.4.6.1.3. RAPCON
         6.4.6.1.4. Airfield Management Operations
     6.4.6.2. Contact 21 OWS and engage in meteorological discussions
     6.4.6.3. Notify Weather Flight Leadership of the following:
         6.4.6.3.1. The current status of threatening severe weather
         6.4.6.3.2. The need for additional Weather Flight personnel to               enhance
         METWATCH
  6.4.7. At a minimum, the Weather Flight and 21 OWS will conduct and document a semi-
  annual exercise of coordinated SWAP. Any actual severe weather event meets the intent of
  an exercise.
  6.4.8. When any of the criteria listed in paragraphs 5.2.1.1. through 5.2.1.5. is forecast to
  occur or is occurring, the 21 OWS and/or the 39 ABW/CP will notify on-call Weather Flight
  personnel.

6.5. Tropical Weather Advisories.
   6.5.1. Tropical storms that may impact or degrade the mission of IAB will be monitored by
   Weather Flight personnel. Weather Flight personnel monitor tropical storm advisories issued
   by the Joint Typhoon Weather Center (JTWC), National Hurricane Center (NHC) and the 21
   OWS and will alert IAB Leadership to any storm that may cause concern to decision makers.
   The Weather Flight cannot deviate from official, tropical system forecast track(s) from the
   JTWC, NHC, or 21 OWS, per AFMAN 15-129. Due to the uncertainty of forecast tracks
   beyond 48 hours, they should only be used for planning purposes only.
   6.5.2. Weather Flight personnel will include forecast tracks that may impact IAB missions or
   personnel into all staff briefings. If no briefing is scheduled to occur and the situation
   warrants immediate attention, Weather Flight personnel will alert the 39 OS/CC to the
   weather threat(s).
