       1.1.2. The TWG conducts meetings on an as needed basis, depending upon overseas
       mission notifications.
    1.2. Membership:
       1.2.1. The TWG is chaired by the 932 OG/CC. TWG principal membership includes

       Support Flight/Current Operations (OSF/OSO), 932 OSF/CD, 932d Mission Support
       Flight Security Forces Operations (MSF/SFO), 54th Airlift Squadron (AS) (C-40
       missions only) and the 73 AS, and will include personnel from Air Force Office of
       Special Investigations (AFOSI) Detachment 301 and 375th Medical Group/Public Health
       (MDG/SGPM) when available. If not available to attend the TWG meetings, AFOSI
       and/or SGPM will be coordinated with regarding the mission(s).
           1.2.1.1. Other internal and external organizations support the TWG with products,
           services and inputs on an as needed basis.

           Division (CVAM) Directed Overseas Missions. The meeting analyzes threats to 932d
           missions, reviews threat mitigation efforts, and assesses required FP measures.
           Missions flown overseas will adhere to the AMC/A3 approved force protection
           policies contained in the applicable country or airfield Risk Assessments (RA).
           Additional, more restrictive FP recommendations may be made based on the localized
           threat; those recommendations will be made to the TWG chair for review/validation.
           Recommendations and mission assessment slides will be forwarded to AMC/A2O
           (amc.a2o@scott.af.smil.mil) and AFRC CAT/A2A Intelligence Analysis and Force
           Protection (afrccatdoi@afrc.robins.af.smil.mil) for their review. AMC/A2O and
           AFRC/A2A will communicate any additional issues or recommendations to 932
           OG/OGI, who is responsible for ensuring these issues or recommendations are
           communicated to the appropriate offices.
              1.3.1.1.1. When mission limitations necessitate deviation from AMC/A3 policy,
              this meeting is also the forum to make recommendations for force protection

              completed, the waiver will go to the 932d Airlift Wing Commander (AW/CC) for
              signature. Policy waiver requests will then be submitted over classified e-mail to
              AMC/A2O, and AFRC CAT/A2O Intelligence will be courtesy copied. The
              SIPRNET web-based AMC Waiver Request site will not be used for requesting
              waivers for any Very Important Person Special Airlift Mission (VIP-SAM).

              processed IAW AMCI 14-106, Threat Working Group. 932 OG/OGI will route
