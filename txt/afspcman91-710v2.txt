Department of the Air Force and the Federal Aviation Administration on Safety for Space Transporta-
tion and Range Activities.This volume incorporates information previously found in Eastern and Western
Range 127-1, Chapter 2, Flight Analysis. It establishes the requirements for flight safety for vehicles
launched and operations conducted from the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) ranges, including the
Eastern Range (ER) and Western Range (WR). The volume includes requirements for the following pro-
grams: ballistic missiles and space vehicles; cruise missiles and remotely piloted vehicles; small unguided
rockets or probe vehicles; aerostats or balloons systems; projectiles, torpedoes, and non-propulsive
air-dropped bodies; air-launched vehicles; intended support plans for aircraft and ships; directed energy
systems; and the launch of large nuclear systems into space. Flight Safety Requirements approval is a
necessary prerequisite for conducting operations covered by this volume. By itself, Flight Safety Require-
ments approval does not constitute permission to conduct an operation. Unless specifically noted in this
volume, the term Range Safety refers to the Operations Support and Flight Safety Requirements groups
at the ER and WR.
This volume applies to all Range Users conducting or supporting operations on the AFSPC ranges. Range
Users include any individual or organization that conducts or supports any activity on resources (land,
sea, or air) owned or controlled by AFSPC ranges. This includes such organizations as the Department of
Defense (DoD), United States (US) government agencies, civilian launch operators, and foreign govern-
ment agencies and other foreign entities that use AFSPC range facilities and test equipment; conduct pre-
launch and launch operations, including payloads to orbital insertion or impact; and/or require on-orbit or
other related support. Commercial users intending to provide launch services from one of the ranges shall
have a license or license application in process from the Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) or have a DoD sponsorship and be accepted by the DoD to use the ER or WR. For-
eign government organizations or other foreign entities shall be sponsored by an appropriate US govern-

does not apply to the Air Force Reserve Command.
NOTE: Volume 1 includes a complete table of contents for all the volumes of AFSPCMAN91-710. In
addition each individual volume contains its own table of contents. Volume 7 contains a glossary of ref-
erences, acronyms and abbreviations, and terms for use with all the volumes. Special publication format-
ting features are described in paragraph 1.1 of this volume.

                                            CHAPTER 1

                                         GROUND RULES

1.1. Organization of the Volume.
   1.1.1. Main Chapters. The main chapters of this volume include common requirements for all vehi-
   cle classes. Appendixes include additional requirements to supplement the main chapters.
   1.1.2. Open Text. The open text contains the actual mandatory performance-based requirements. The
   only tailoring expected for these requirements would be the deletion of non-applicable requirements.
   For example, solid rocket motor performance requirements would be deleted for launch systems that
   do not use solid rocket motors.
   1.1.3. Bordered Paragraphs:
      1.1.3.1. Bordered paragraphs are non-mandatory and are used to identify some of the potential
      detailed technical solutions that meet the performance requirements. In addition, the bordered
      paragraphs contain lessons learned from previous applications of the performance requirement,
      where a certain design may have been found successful, or have been tried and failed to meet the
      requirement. These technical solutions are provided for the following reasons:
          1.1.3.1.1. To aid the tailoring process between Range Safety and Range Users in evaluating a
          potential system against all the performance requirements.
          1.1.3.1.2. To aid Range Safety and Range Users in implementing lessons learned.
          1.1.3.1.3. To provide benchmarks that demonstrate what Range Safety considers an accept-
          able technical solution/implementation of the performance requirement and to help convey the
          level of safety the performance requirement is intended to achieve.
      1.1.3.2. The technical solutions in the bordered paragraphs may be adopted into the tailored ver-
      sion of the requirements for a specific program when the Range User intends to use that solution
      to meet the performance requirement. At this point, they become mandatory requirements to
      obtain Range Safety approval. This process is done to:
          1.1.3.2.1. Provide an appropriate level of detail necessary for contractual efforts and to pro-
          mote efficiency in the design process.
          1.1.3.2.2. Avoid contractual misunderstandings that experience has shown often occur if an
          appropriate level of detail is not agreed to. The level of detail in the bordered paragraphs is
          necessary to avoid costly out-of-scope contractual changes and to prevent inadvertently over-
          looking a critical technical requirement.
      1.1.3.3. The Range User always has the option to propose alternatives to the bordered paragraph
      solutions. Range User proposed alternative solutions shall achieve an equivalent level of safety
      and be approved by Range Safety. After meeting these two requirements, the Range User pro-
      posed solutions become part of the tailored AFSPCMAN 91-710 for that specific program.
      1.1.3.4. Range Safety has final decision authority in determining whether Range User proposed
      detailed technical solutions meet AFSPCMAN 91-710 performance requirements.

1.2. Impact Restrictions:
6                                                                   AFSPCMAN 91-710V2 1 JULY 2004


    1.2.1. No launch vehicle, payload, or jettisoned body shall be intentionally impacted on land unless
    approved by the Chief of Safety and meets the public risk criteria in Volume 1, 3.2 of this publication.
    Proposed flights shall be planned and trajectories shaped so that normal impact dispersion areas for
    such items do not encompass land.
    1.2.2. If any jettisoned body remains buoyant after impact and presents a hazard to maritime vessels
    or platforms, a means of sinking or recovering the body shall be provided.
    1.2.3. For space vehicles, if a stage contains multiple-burn engines, the impact dispersion area corre-
    sponding to any planned cutoff before orbital insertion shall be entirely over water.


 Time permitting, critical events, such as the arming of engine cutoff circuits and the transmis-
 sion of backup engine cutoff commands, should be sequenced to occur when the impact disper-
 sion areas are entirely over water.

    1.2.4. In accordance with DoDD 4540.1, Use of Airspace by U.S. Military Aircraft and Firings Over
    the High Seas, all operations shall be conducted with due regard for the safety of all air and surface
    traffic. Areas for activities shall be selected so as not to interfere with established air routes and ocean
    shipping lanes.

1.3. Land Overflight. The overflight of any inhabited landmasses is discouraged and is approved only if
operation requirements make overflight necessary and risk studies indicate the probability of impact and
casualty expectancy is acceptable.

1.4. Trajectory Safety Margins:
    1.4.1. The flight trajectory shall be designed to accommodate Range Safety capability to control
    launch-related risks.
    1.4.2. A sufficient safety margin shall be provided between the intended flight path and protected
    areas so a normal vehicle does not violate destruct criteria.
    1.4.3. During the initial launch phase, the launch profile shall not be so steep that critical coastal areas
    cannot be protected by standard safety destruct criteria.
    1.4.4. No hazardous condition is acceptable if mission objectives can be obtained from a safer
    approach, methodology, or position.

1.5. Data Submission:
    1.5.1. General. The Range User is only required to supply required data once if no changes occur
    from operation to operation. If this is the case, the Range User shall state, in writing to Range Safety,
    that there are no changes. However, if any changes occur from operation to operation, the Range User
    shall identify, in writing to Range Safety, all data that have changed from a specified baseline mission
    and specify the document, paragraph, and page number where each change item can be found. This
    statement shall be submitted to Range Safety according to established lead times.
    1.5.2. Statement of Program Justification. The Range User shall provide the following additional
    supporting data justification before a Range Safety program approval can be made. The level of detail
AFSPCMAN 91-710V2 1 JULY 2004                                                                              7


   required for this information shall be established in preliminary discussions with Range Safety or in
   the Chief of Safety’s response to a Range User’s written request for approval.
       1.5.2.1. Detailed explanation of the operation/mission objectives.
       1.5.2.2. Operation/mission objectives that will not be met if the proposed plan must be modified
       as suggested by Range Safety or is not approved.
       1.5.2.3. Alternate or modified plans that will accomplish the operation/mission objective.
       1.5.2.4. Effects on the operation/mission such as cost, schedule, data requirements, vehicle reli-
       ability, reserve propellants, and launch window, if the plan must be modified or if the plan is not
       approved.
       1.5.2.5. Other data the Range User may wish to submit.

1.6. Range User Responsibilities. Range Users shall be responsible for the following:
   1.6.1. Submitting all data identified as requirements for Range Safety support of planned operations.
   1.6.2. Complying with data submission lead times and Range Safety approval conditions.
   1.6.3. Advising Range Safety of changes to operational scenarios to determine if approvals are
   affected.
   1.6.4. Providing specific data required for the scheduled operation day.
   1.6.5. Ensuring accuracy and relevancy of all data to support the requests for approvals.
   1.6.6. Providing anticipated trajectory data to the lead range when the Program Requirements Docu-
   ment (PRD) is submitted, when trajectories are changed, or when additional trajectories are added.
   Range Users should contact Range Safety for flight trajectory data preparation, submittal, and pro-
   cessing.
   1.6.7. Revising theoretical trajectory data when use of the trajectory, as supplied, will adversely affect
   the support needed by either the planning or operational phases of the Range User program.
   1.6.8. Providing hazard assessments (the process of identifying operation-related hazards, assess-
   ments of those hazards, and quantification of risk to establish operation constraints.)

 The hazards associated with each source of risk (debris impact, toxic chemical dispersion, and
 acoustic overpressure) have an associated set of critical parameters and thresholds of accept-
 ability. Changes in the launch parameters, such as azimuth, payload, and launch site, and the
 need for flight safety controls, including the evacuation of personnel, enforcement of road-
 blocks, and restriction of sea lanes or airspace, depend on the results of the hazard assessments.

   1.6.9. Range User Range Tracking System Performance Requirements. The following require-
   ments apply to Range Users who use other than AFSPC range assets for range tracking. The range
   tracking system (RTS) consists of the hardware, software, and personnel required to transmit, receive,
   process, and display launch vehicle data for Range Safety purposes.
       1.6.9.1. General. An RTS, including at least two adequate and independent instrumentation data
       sources shall be provided and shall be maintained from T-0 through each phase of powered flight
       up to the end of Range Safety responsibility.
8                                                                    AFSPCMAN 91-710V2 1 JULY 2004


          1.6.9.2. Tracking Source Adequacy. Each tracking source, provided for Range Safety, shall pro-
          vide real-time state vector accuracy (position and velocity), timeliness, and reliability so that when
          extrapolated to the instantaneous impact point (IIP) space, the following criteria shall be met:
              1.6.9.2.1. Accuracy. The three-sigma present position and IIP uncertainty, resulting from all
              error sources, shall be no greater than the following:
                  1.6.9.2.1.1. Eastern Range:
                      1.6.9.2.1.1.1. Sensor performance benchmarks shall be provided for the launch area
                      and downrange (as defined below) in terms of the arc range to IIP (RIIP), assuming a
                      pad launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS). The accuracy bench-
                      marks for other than pad launches (such as sea launches and reusable launch vehicles)
                      shall be based on the arc range to the nearest populated landmass.
                          1.6.9.2.1.1.1.1. Launch Area Benchmarks:
                              1.6.9.2.1.1.1.1.1. Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS):

    DGPS benchmarks are based on the acceptable worst case accuracy of DGPS as a range track-
    ing system and by themselves will not prevent a vehicle from launching. The radar benchmarks
    are based on the current ER average prime source launch area accuracy of approximately 15
    meters (one sigma). In addition, of the real-time state vectors that do not meet the benchmarks,
    no more than 10 real-time state vectors (i.e., one second period, assuming a 10 pps update rate)
    should occur consecutively. Implied in this is that the total system delay time, from vehicle state
    vector through destruct activation on the vehicle will be < 4 seconds.

                                 1. The present position uncertainties shall not exceed 250 feet when the
                                    RIIP < 66,000 feet.
                                 2. The crossrange IIP uncertainties shall not exceed 330 feet when the
                                    RIIP < 66,000 feet.
                              1.6.9.2.1.1.1.1.2. Radar:
                                 1. The present position uncertainties shall not exceed 140 feet when the
                                    RIIP < 50,000 feet.
                                 2. The crossrange IIP uncertainties shall not exceed 300 feet when the
                                    RIIP < 20,000 feet.
                                 3. The downrange IIP uncertainties shall not exceed 300 feet when the
                                    RIIP < 6,000 feet.
                          1.6.9.2.1.1.1.2. Downrange Benchmarks:
                              1.6.9.2.1.1.1.2.1. DGPS:
                                 1. The crossrange IIP uncertainty shall not exceed 0.5 percent of the vac-
                                    uum impact range when the RIIP > 66,000 feet.
                                 2. The downrange IIP uncertainty shall not exceed 1.0 percent of the vac-
                                    uum impact range when the RIIP > 66,000 feet.

                              of the vacuum impact range when 20,000 feet < RIIP < 100,000 feet.
                           2. The crossrange IIP uncertainty shall not exceed 0.5 percent of the vac-
                              uum impact range when the RIIP > 100,000 feet.
                           3. The downrange IIP uncertainty shall not exceed 5.0 percent of the vac-
                              uum impact range when the RIIP > 6,000 feet.
            1.6.9.2.1.2. Western Range:
                1.6.9.2.1.2.1. The launch area IIP uncertainties shall not exceed 1,000 feet.
                1.6.9.2.1.2.2. The midcourse IIP uncertainties shall not exceed 1.0 percent of the IIP
                range.
                1.6.9.2.1.2.3. The terminal area IIP uncertainties shall not exceed 7,000 feet.

                   1.6.9.2.1.2.4.1. Accuracy is determined in terms of the radius of a circle that con-
                   tains three sigma of all possible instantaneous impact points.
                   1.6.9.2.1.2.4.2. Launch area accuracy applies until the hazardous debris impact
                   areas are entirely over water.
                   1.6.9.2.1.2.4.3. Terminal area accuracy applies only to ballistic vehicles with a
                   maneuverable upper stage targeted for the Reagan Test Site.
        1.6.9.2.2. Timeliness:
            1.6.9.2.2.1. The IIP display update rate shall be > 10 samples per second and each update
            shall meet the requirements of paragraphs 1.6.8.3.1 and 1.6.8.3.2.2.
            1.6.9.2.2.2. The time delay between vehicle event and firing of the vehicle ordnance,
            excluding the Mission Flight Control Officer (MFCO) reaction time, shall be within the
            total Range Safety System response time budget. This budget includes hardware and soft-
            ware delays inherent to both airborne and ground equipment. The budget for the ER is
            either 1.5 or 3.5 seconds depending on the time of flight and Range Safety System config-
            uration for each operation. The WR budget is 1.0 second, except for ballistic operations
            targeted for the Reagan Test Site and orbital operations with a low launch azimuth (typi-
            cally < 170 degrees) for which the budget is 500 milliseconds during critical portions of
            the flight.
        1.6.9.2.3. RTS Reliability. The reliability of the RTS ground segment shall be > 0.999 at a 95
        percent confidence level for a 1 hour duration during the period of Range Safety responsibility.
     1.6.9.3. Tracking Source Independence. Each tracking source provided for Range Safety shall
     be electrically, mechanically, and structurally separate from the vehicle guidance and telemetry
     systems and any other tracking source, so that one tracking source will not influence another
     tracking source.

                 FLIGHT ANALYSIS APPROVAL AND DATA REQUIREMENTS

2.1. Introduction. The Range User shall initiate flight analysis approval at the earliest practical date to
establish that the proposed program is acceptable from a safety standpoint. Early action by the Range
User keeps data requirements to a minimum and ensures that the effort and expense of planning a program
or computing pre-operation trajectories is not wasted. The specific approval depends on the type of pro-
gram activity. Developing the safest operation consistent with program objectives can take several months
while changes in the proposed plan are made. This chapter is subdivided into four distinct classes of flight
analysis approvals: Flight Plan Approval (FPA) and Data Requirements, Aircraft/Ships Intended Support
Plans (ISP) Approval and Data Requirements, Directed Energy Plan (DEP) Approval and Data Require-
ments, and Large Nuclear Systems Approval and Data Requirements.
     2.1.1. Security and Data Delivery Lead Times:
        2.1.1.1. Security. The Range User shall provide a Security Classification Guide for all classified
        program information.
        2.1.1.2. Lead Times. Before Range Safety approval is granted, the Range User shall provide
        required data in specified formats in accordance with the lead times listed in Table 2.1. Lead times
        may be modified depending on the complexity of the program. If the requirements are not pro-
        vided within the lead-time specified, Range Safety may not be able to prepare all necessary safety
        criteria in time to support a proposed operation. In this event, the operation shall not be conducted
        until Range Safety can make adequate safety preparations.

2.2. Flight Plan Approval and Data Requirements Overview. Flight plan approval (FPA) is applica-
ble to the following programs: ballistic missile and space vehicles; cruise missiles and remotely piloted
vehicles; small unguided rockets or probes; aerostats or balloon systems; projectiles, torpedoes, non-pro-
pulsive air-dropped bodies, or any small devices to be flight tested.
   2.2.1. Approval Phases. The FPA process incorporates two formal approval phases: Preliminary
   Flight Plan Approval (PFPA) and Final Flight Plan Approval (FFPA).
        2.2.1.1. Programs usually fall into two categories: new or existing. New programs include exist-
        ing programs whose FPA supporting data has changed significantly. New programs shall submit
        the data requirements for both PFPA and FFPA. Existing programs generally shall submit the data
        requirements for only FFPA. For either new or existing programs that do not involve long lead
        times for planning or payload development, formal approval may, of necessity, occur only a few
        months before the desired operation date.
        2.2.1.2. In each FPA phase, Range Safety shall respond to the Range User’s written request for
        approval in one of the following ways: (1) by issuing a letter of approval, (2) by issuing a letter of
        disapproval, (3) by requesting that a change in the proposed plan be made or evaluated, or (4) by
        requesting additional data. After all the requested data have been provided and evaluated, the
        Range User shall be given an “approval,” “conditional approval,” or “disapproval” letter. If the
12                                                                 AFSPCMAN 91-710V2 1 JULY 2004


        flight plan or mission is approved, the letter shall specify the conditions of approval pertaining to
        such things as launch azimuth limits, trajectory shaping, wind restrictions, locations of impact
        areas, times of discrete events, and number of operations for which the approval applies. The
        approval shall be final as long as the operation(s) remain within the stated conditions. If signifi-
        cant changes to the flight plan occur after approval has been granted, further analysis of the
        revised plan may be necessary. The Range User is responsible for advising Range Safety of any
        such changes or anticipated changes as early as possible.
     2.2.2. Data Requirements. Data requirements for the PFPA and FFPA are found in two chapters of
     this volume. The requirements in Chapter 2 apply to all programs. Requirements for specific pro-
     grams, including detailed analyses, are in Chapter 3 of this volume. All requirements may be tailored
     by Range Safety, as required. The Preliminary Flight Data Package (PFDP) and the Final Flight Data
     Package (FFDP) are submitted in support of the PFPA and FFPA, respectively. The data packages may
     be submitted in any convenient format. The following general format, that conforms to the order in
     which requirements are established, is suggested for any Range User who desires a standard submis-
     sion form. If this format is adopted and the information submitted in response to a requirement cannot
     easily be placed in the data package, it should be made an appendix to the specific part. For example,
     compact disks and listings for trajectories would be an appendix to Part III in the format shown below.
        Table of Contents
        Part I: Introduction
        Part II: General Vehicle Data
        Part III: Trajectory Data
        Part IV: Additional Data
     2.2.3. Preliminary Flight Plan Approval and Data Package Requirements:
        2.2.3.1. PFPA. The FPA process for all new programs begins with an introductory meeting fol-
        lowed by the submittal of required data and a formal written request for a PFPA. Existing pro-
        grams shall also request a PFPA when previously approved supporting data is not applicable to the
        planned operation. The purpose of the PFPA is to ensure Range Safety requirements are included
        in the overall system design and to determine if the specific program is conceptually acceptable. In
        preliminary meetings, Range Safety can define acceptable flight limits and conditions, specify
        which parts of the flight plan need special emphasis, and identify requirements applicable to the
        program. Data regarding anticipated flight trajectories, booster configuration, and flight termina-
        tion system (FTS) configuration shall be included in the PFPA. Lack of some pertinent data should
        not be cause for delaying the initial written request, particularly if preliminary discussions have
        not been held. The Range User should begin PFPA action during the Preliminary Design Review
        (PDR) phase of the program planning or, in any event, immediately after Range Safety has replied
        to the Program Introduction (PI) in a Statement of Capability. For new programs, the PFPA usually
        occurs at least two years (one year for existing programs) before the planned operation.
        2.2.3.2. Preliminary Flight Data Package Requirements. In addition to the program-specific
        requirements listed in Chapter 3 of this volume, the PFPA data package shall include the follow-
        ing:
            2.2.3.2.1. Basic program description and objectives including number, designation, and pur-
            pose of operation(s) for which the proposed flight plan is applicable.

        2.2.3.3.1. Description of Failure Modes That Can Result in Abnormal Flight. An analysis of
        all subsystems shall be made to determine failure modes that would result in a catastrophic
        event. Typical malfunctions that should be considered include failure of the hydraulic and
        electrical systems, failure of the guidance and control system, failure of separation mecha-
        nisms between stages, failures that lead to premature thrust termination, overshoot, or shifting
        of the platform reference.
        2.2.3.3.2. An estimate of the probability of occurrence or failure rate (versus time) for each
        failure mode and an explanation of the method(s) used for the estimate; any other information
        considered pertinent with respect to critical portions of flight, such as vehicle stability charac-
        teristics and structural limits.
        2.2.3.3.3. Description of All Credible Failed Vehicle Response Modes. A response mode is a
        category of vehicle dynamic response, including vehicle breakup, that results from one or
        more failure modes. At a minimum, the response modes should include on-trajectory failures
        such as thrust termination and explosion and malfunction turn (loss of thrust vector control,
        tumble turn, nozzle burn-through failures). On-trajectory failures should be subdivided
        according to the type of breakup (for example, aerodynamic or explosive) that will result. Mal-
        function turns should be subdivided into tumble turns and trimmed turns if trimmed turns are
        a credible response mode.
        2.2.3.3.4. Summary of past vehicle performance giving number launched, launch location,
        number that performed normally, behavior and actual (if available) or estimated impact loca-
        tion for any that malfunctioned, time and nature of malfunction, and corrective action.
     2.2.3.4. Propellant Description. If a vehicle has the capability of exploding as a result of
     self-initiation, FTS activation, or ground or water impact or if a vehicle uses propellants that are
     toxic in gaseous or vapor states due to combustion or release to the atmosphere, the following data
     shall be provided:
        2.2.3.4.1. Types of propellant or a statement indicating the same propellant formulation is
        already in use. The following thermodynamic and chemical information shall be provided for
        each propellant type used on the vehicle:
            2.2.3.4.1.1. List of Major Chemical Constituents. A major constituent is defined as a
            chemical component that (1) constitutes more than 1 percent of the propellant mass, (2) is
            a toxic chemical, or (3) produces a toxic combustion product. The list of combined constit-
            uents shall account for at least 99 percent of the total propellant mass.
            2.2.3.4.1.2. Chemical formula for each major constituent.
            2.2.3.4.1.3. Mass fraction of each major constituent relative to the total mass propellant.

           2.2.3.4.1.7. Molecular weight of each chemical constituent.
        2.2.3.4.2. TNT equivalency of remaining propellant versus flight time and explosion scenario
        for each separate stage (or motor) and each possible combination of stages that could result
        from malfunction conditions.
        2.2.3.4.3. An estimate for the probability of explosion versus flight time for each of the fol-
        lowing: self-initiation, FTS activation, and ground or water impact. A comprehensive descrip-
        tion of the methods used to derive the estimate shall be provided.
        2.2.3.4.4. Description of methods used to minimize the possibility of explosion.

        2.2.3.4.7. Nominal vehicle altitude versus time through 3,000 meters in the following format:



        Where:
        t = time (seconds) after ignition
        z = height (meters) of the vehicle above ground, and a, b, c, are coefficients found by a least
        squares fit to an estimated time-height profile
        2.2.3.4.8. Exhaust plume heat content (calorie/gram), mass flux (gram/second), and chemical
        composition (mass fractions and chemical species) for all motors ignited at liftoff. This data
        shall be evaluated at a point sufficiently far downstream from the nozzle exit plume such that
        plume afterburning is essentially complete and the plume has expanded and cooled suffi-
        ciently to allow high temperature combustion species to have completed recombination
        actions. Total mass flux shall indicate nominal engine burn propellant mass flux as well as
        entrained air mass flux. Documentation of this data shall include reference to the method of
        calculation, distance downstream from the nozzle, possible chemical interactions between
        main engines and strap-on boosters (if appropriate), and radiation heat loss. Chemical compo-
        sition of the plume shall cover all major species such that (1) at least 99 percent of total plume
        mass is represented, and (2) all major toxic species are included. Chemical species of concern
        to Range Safety include, but are not necessarily limited to, hydrogen chloride, carbon dioxide,
        carbon monoxide, aluminum oxide, hydrazine, unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine, monometh-
        ylhydrazine, nitrogen tetroxide, nitrogen dioxide, nitric acid, nitrosodimethylamine, formalde-
        hyde dimethylhydrazine, benzene, toluene, and other volatile organic compounds.

     destruct for each motor containing solid propellant. Fuel fragmentation assumptions (number
     and size of fragments, surface area, inches/second burn rate) used to generate the average solid
     propellant burn time and mass burn rate shall be included.
     2.2.3.4.10. Liquid propellant expenditure rate (grams/seconds) for nominal launch for the first
     3,000 meters of vehicle ascent.
     2.2.3.4.11. For catastrophic abort or FTS vehicle destruct of vehicles using liquid propellants,
     the information described below is required to support Range Safety toxic risk analyses.
     Depending on the similarity of the program vehicle’s propellants to existing vehicle propel-
     lants, the Range User may be required to perform significant additional technical analyses to
     provide this information.
        2.2.3.4.11.1. Percentages of available liquid fuel and oxidizer mixed and reacted within
        each stage during the first several hundred milliseconds of the initiating destruct mecha-
        nism.

        active fireball burn phase that typically last several seconds past the initiating event. Pro-
        vide assumptions about the degree of mixing and the nature of chemical reaction between
        vehicle stages, including solid rocket motors and the extent of air entrainment and after-
        burning of fuel species.
        2.2.3.4.11.3. Percentage of available liquid propellants dispersed by vehicle explosion
        that do not undergo chemical reactions but remain as vaporized unreacted propellant. The
        objective of obtaining this information is to characterize and quantify the types of chemi-
        cal reactions among the vehicle propellants so that the chemical composition and total heat
        content of the liquid propellant fireball can be computed from input reactant data.
     2.2.3.4.12. Initial Exhaust Cloud Data. The following information shall be provided to specify
     the initial parameters required to calculate buoyant cloud rise in support of Range Safety toxic
     risk analyses. These values describe the exhaust ground cloud when the horizontal momentum
     produced by the ducting or reflection in the launch mount becomes negligible compared to the
     buoyant forces within the cloud for the nominal launch scenario. Depending on the similarity
     of the program vehicle to existing vehicles, the Range User may be required to perform signif-
     icant additional technical analyses to provide this information.
        2.2.3.4.12.1. Initial exhaust ground cloud radius for normal launches. Assume a spherical
        cloud with a volume equivalent to that estimated for the actual ground cloud.
        2.2.3.4.12.2. Initial radius of the area over which solid propellant fragments are dispersed
        due to a vehicle abort on the pad. For aborts during the first 50 seconds of flight, provide
        estimates of solid propellant fragment number, size, mass, ballistic coefficient, explo-
        sion-induced fragment velocity, and nominal vehicle position; and, at 10-second intervals,
        velocity vector.
        2.2.3.4.12.3. Vertical velocity of the ground cloud centroid for nominal launch cases.
        2.2.3.4.12.4. Initial ground cloud centroid height (meters above ground level [AGL]).

     2.2.3.5. Explosive Reentry Vehicle or Warhead Information. An operation that includes the
     use of an explosive reentry vehicle (RV) or warhead shall not be conducted without the approval
     of the Space Wing Commander. For these operations, the following data are required:
        2.2.3.5.1. A complete justification for the proposed operation.
        2.2.3.5.2. The proposed position and altitude of the RV or warhead detonation point.
        2.2.3.5.3. The effects of the detonation on the missile and RV or warhead in terms of number,
        weights, cross-sectional areas, ballistic coefficients, and velocities imparted to the pieces.

        any toxic or radioactive clouds or fragments and the radiation exposure characteristics.
  2.2.4. Final Flight Plan Approval and Data Package Requirements:
     2.2.4.1. FFPA. The FFPA is applicable to each program operation. The FFPA is based on
     detailed analyses of the operation objectives, vehicle performance, and other data items required.
     In response to the Range User request, the FFPA is issued when the Chief of Safety is satisfied that
     a specific operation can be supported within the limits of flight safety control capabilities to pro-
     vide positive protection to life and property. Any constraints or conditions identified in the PFPA
     may be superseded by those stated in the FFPA. The FFPA applies to a specific operation and does
     not guarantee that similar operations will receive an FFPA. If a program consists of identical oper-
     ations, a blanket FFPA may be granted that would remain in effect throughout the life of the pro-
     gram as long as the operations remain within the specified safety constraints. The request for
     FFPA and the supporting data are typically received by Range Safety at 120 calendar days (new
     programs) or 60 calendar days (existing programs) before the planned operation. Past data submit-
     tals may be referenced if that data has not changed from previous operations.
     2.2.4.2. Final Flight Data Package Requirements.
        2.2.4.2.1. General. These data requirements apply to requests for FFPA for all programs
        specified in 2.2. The analysis-specific data requirements in Chapter 3, 3.1 through 3.7 of this
        volume are also required before an FFPA is issued. The FFDP shall include items that were
        changed from or not provided in the PFDP. The FFDP is made up of the data requirements
        used to produce the final set of operational rules and flight control criteria and ensures all data
        complies with the conditions of the PFPA and data format requirements. The request for FFPA
        shall specify the operation designation, intended operation date, and references to all applica-
        ble supporting data products. In meeting the FFPA requirements, some of the information sub-
        mitted by the Range User may not change from the PFDP or from operation to operation. In
        such cases, the information need be supplied only once. However, for each operation, the
        Range User shall state in writing which supporting data are applicable and specify the docu-
        ment, page number, and paragraph where each required item can be found. In other cases
        where the proposed plan deviates from the PFPA or previously accepted limits, additional data
        shall be provided.
        2.2.4.2.2. Limits of a Useful Mission.
            2.2.4.2.2.1. These data requirements apply solely to space operations. They are used to
            establish guidelines or limits for land overflight prior to orbital insertion.

        2.2.4.2.2.2. The permissible limits for overflight depend not only on this data, but also on
        estimated overflight hazards, the operational objectives, and the importance of these objec-
        tives. The Range User shall provide the following data:
            2.2.4.2.2.2.1. Launch azimuth limits for which the primary operation objectives can
            be met and for which a useful orbit can be attained.
            2.2.4.2.2.2.2. Operational objectives that will be met or the extent to which the pri-
            mary objectives will be degraded.
            2.2.4.2.2.2.3. Description of limiting orbit(s) (apogee, perigee, period, and inclina-
            tion) as a function of overflight azimuth.
            2.2.4.2.2.2.4. Circumstances or types of malfunctions that could cause the vehicle to
            fly outside the three sigma limits of normality, but remain within the limits for which a
            useful orbit can be attained.
               2.2.4.2.2.2.4.1. The probability of occurrence of these malfunctions.
               2.2.4.2.2.2.4.2. The affects of these malfunctions on the success of succeeding
               burns or stages.
            2.2.4.2.2.2.5. The most lofted and depressed trajectories for which the primary opera-
            tion objective can be met and for which a useful orbit can be attained, given the infor-
            mation requested in paragraphs 2.2.4.2.2.2.1 through 2.2.4.2.2.2.4.2. In deriving these
            trajectories, only perturbations that result in deviations in the pitch plane shall be con-
            sidered. If these trajectories cannot be provided to Range Safety, the following may be
            substituted:
               2.2.4.2.2.2.5.1. If the stage that achieves orbit does not contain an FTS, the Range
               User shall provide the upper and lower altitude limits at shutdown of the last sub-
               orbital stage if the succeeding stage is to attain a useful orbit.
               2.2.4.2.2.2.5.2. If the stage that achieves orbit contains an FTS, the Range User
               shall provide the upper and lower altitude limits as the vacuum impact point
               reaches the continent to be overflown by the first orbital stage if this stage is to
               attain a useful orbit.
               2.2.4.2.2.2.5.3. The Range User shall provide the minimum impact range that the
               last suborbital stage must achieve, if the succeeding stage is to attain a useful orbit
               and a minimum orbit (perigee > 70 miles).
     2.2.4.2.3. Solid Propellant Data Requirements. The following data are required for solid
     propellants:
        2.2.4.2.3.1. Burning rate of solid propellants, in inches/second, as a function of pressure,
        including ambient atmospheric pressures.
        2.2.4.2.3.2. Percent propellant TNT equivalency for each stage as a function of relevant
        impact parameters, such as weight of propellant, impact velocity, surface composition, and
        impact geometry.
        2.2.4.2.3.3. Stage ignition and burntime, propellant weight versus time, and propellant
        density.

2.3. Aircraft/Ship Intended Support Plans and Data Package Requirements:
   2.3.1. Purpose. The purpose of the ISP approval is to ensure maximum safety consistent with the
   operation objectives. To the extent possible, this means that support positions and flight plans should
   be established outside impact limit lines. When the required support data cannot be collected from
   such remote locations, support positions located in relatively hazardous areas shall be carefully
   planned to minimize the ship or aircraft hit probability. Hazards to ships and aircraft exist primarily in
   the launch area, along the flight azimuth where jettisoned stages and components reenter and breakup,
   and in the target area where reentry vehicles and final stages impact. ISP approval is applicable to
   each ship and aircraft supporting an operation requirement identified in the Universal Documentation
   System (UDS) or participating in an operation on a non-interference basis. Policies and procedures for
   control of test support aircraft are given in 30 RANS Operating Instruction (OI) 55- 33, Air Control/
   Control Procedures, or 45 SWI 13-201, Eastern Range Air Space Management Procedures. Similar
   regulations for ships do not exist.
   2.3.2. ISP Development and Submittal. ISPs for ships and aircraft shall be developed either by the
   Range User or by support agencies that are responding to requirements contained in the PRD or the
   Operations Requirements Document (ORD). In either case, the developing organization shall furnish
   the ISP for review and approval, either directly to Range Safety or through the Range Squadron.
   2.3.3. ISP Data Package Requirements. For operations requiring support aircraft or ships, the
   Range User shall provide the following additional information 20 calendar days before the mission.
   All identifying points and positions shall be time correlated using the operation start time as a refer-
   ence.

2.4. Directed Energy Plan Approval and Data Requirements. These requirements apply to all forms
of directed energy systems. Laser design, test, and documentation requirements are also addressed in 8.2.
Laser Systems of Volume 3 of this publication. Reasonable and prudent operational procedures shall be
established so that hazards from directed energy system operations present virtually no risk to the general
public.
     2.4.1. Purpose. The purpose of the Directed Energy Plan (DEP) approval is to ensure the operation
     is conducted safely with consideration for the operation requirements and national need. The DEP
     approval applies to programs using directed energy systems. These systems include, but are not lim-
     ited to, lasers and neutral particle and ion beams, with any combination of surface, air, or space loca-
     tions for the energy source and target. In this volume, the term laser is used as a generic reference to
     all directed energy systems. In general, those laser operations in the following categories are subject
     to review:
        2.4.1.1. Laser operations requesting range support through the provision of the UDS.
        2.4.1.2. Laser illumination, for which an Operations Directive (OD) does not exist, conducted in
        conjunction with a scheduled range operation for which an OD does exist.
AFSPCMAN 91-710V2 1 JULY 2004                                                                         21


     2.4.1.3. Laser operations having the potential to impair Range Safety controls or reduce the reli-
     ability of Range Safety systems .
  2.4.2. DEP Submittal:
     2.4.2.1. Requests for DEP approval shall be forwarded directly to Range Safety or through either
     the Plans Office for new programs or the Range Squadron for existing programs. Lead times and
     requirements may vary and shall be tailored depending on the specific characteristics of the sys-
     tem and proposed operating scenarios. Lead times for data requirements reflect the dependence of
     mission success on planned laser operations. For instance, laser operations performed on a
     non-interference basis using scheduled launches as a target of opportunity will have lead times dif-
     ferent from directed energy activities that are integral to a scheduled operation.
     2.4.2.2. Laser operations considered mandatory by the Range User shall be included as part of the
     Program Introduction (PI). If the laser operation is not mandatory in accordance with Range User
     requirements, the initial request for laser program approval is desired at least one year before the

     cle’s normal flight. Normal flight is defined as a properly performing vehicle whose real-time IIP does
     not deviate from the nominal IIP by more than those of three-sigma dispersed trajectories generated
     according to Attachment 1, A1.2.4 of this volume.

                may be substituted for the position vector, and the total earth-fixed velocity and flight path
                angle may be substituted for the velocity vector. The data should be provided in time incre-
                ments no larger than 5 seconds (may vary depending on the program).

                    retro-rockets, and the end of burns that occur before orbital insertion, shall be indi-
                    cated.

                variable azimuth flight plans with launch vehicles having multiple liquid propellant
                engines that normally thrust at liftoff, the trajectories in Table A1.3 of Attachment 1 of
                this volume are required for engine-out (not-thrusting) conditions. Range Safety shall

     3.1.2.2. Cruise Missiles and Remotely Piloted Vehicles. In general, cruise missile operations
     involving intentional land overflight (except for launch and landing) will not be approved. In
     highly unusual situations where the operation objectives dictate otherwise and preliminary flight
     plan approval has been granted, the information requested in 3.1.2.2.2.2.2 will be used to establish
     guidelines or limits for land overflight. The permissible limits will depend not only on this infor-
     mation but also on estimates of overflight hazards, the operation objectives, and the importance of
     these objectives. The following items are required for each flight or group of similar flights and
     shall be updated as vehicle configuration changes occur or revised information becomes available.

        earth-fixed velocity and flight path angle may be substituted for the velocity vector. The
        data shall be provided in time increments no larger than 5 seconds. If trajectory data cannot

                3.1.2.2.2.2.3. The operation objectives that will not be met or the extent to which pri-
                mary objectives will be degraded if land overflight is not permitted when the missile is

                the requirements in 3.1.2.2.2.2.4.
            3.1.2.2.2.3. Trajectories. These requirements identify the types of trajectories required for
            the following flight plans. All trajectories are to be developed using the procedures and
            format described in Attachment 1 of this volume.
                3.1.2.2.2.3.1. Single Flight Azimuths. See Attachment 1, Table A1.1 of this volume.
                3.1.2.2.2.3.2. Variable Flight Azimuths. Operations with variable flight azimuths shall
                provide a complete set of firing tables detailing launch times and flight azimuths for
                each day of the launch window. See Attachment 1, Table A1.2 of this volume.
                3.1.2.2.2.3.3. Multiple Liquid Propellant Engines Thrusting at Ignition. For single or
                variable azimuth flight plans with vehicles having multiple liquid propellant engines
                that normally thrust at liftoff, the trajectories in Table A1.3 of Attachment 1 of this vol-

            ponents, starting and ending of control modes, and initiation of recovery devices.
     3.1.2.3. Small Unguided Rockets and Probe Launch Vehicles. The term small unguided rocket
     is not precisely defined here; it generally refers to one- or two-stage rockets having maximum
     impact ranges less than 100 nautical miles. Small rockets are not required to carry FTSs when dis-
     persion analyses and control of launch conditions indicate that all vehicle components can be con-
     tained within predetermined safe areas. Unguided rockets of more than two stages or with impact
     ranges greater than 100 nautical miles are required to carry an FTS. In this event, the data require-
     ments specified in 3.1.2.1. for ballistic missiles and space vehicles shall apply. The following
     vehicle-related items are required for each rocket flight or group of similar flights and shall be
     updated as vehicle configuration changes occur or revised information becomes available.
        3.1.2.3.1. Small Unguided Rocket and Probe Launch Vehicle PFDP. The following data

        tion, number that performed normally and number that malfunctioned, behavior and
        impact location for those that malfunctioned, nature of malfunction and corrective action;
        this requirement can be met by submission of portions of 2.2.3.3.
     3.1.2.3.2. Small Unguided Rocket and Probe Launch Vehicle FFDP. The following data
     are required in addition to requirements specified in 2.2.4:
        3.1.2.3.2.1. General Data:
           3.1.2.3.2.1.1. General information concerning the purpose and objectives of the oper-
           ation, such as data to be obtained, number of launches planned, and a brief description

           variation in azimuth and elevation angles that are acceptable from the standpoint of the
           operation objectives. Indicate which of the operation objectives actually determine the
           acceptable limits for azimuth and elevation angles.
           3.1.2.3.2.1.5. A brief description of the type of launcher; for example zero length or
           short rail, travel distance of the rocket to clear the launcher, the amount of effective
           guidance, launcher adjustments available in quadrant elevation angle (QE) and azi-
           muth, and the smallest increment for these adjustments.
           3.1.2.3.2.1.6. Total vehicle weight at liftoff.
           3.1.2.3.2.1.7. Total propellant weight in each stage at liftoff.

           tison.
        3.1.2.3.2.2. Jettisoned Body Data. Nominal impact point, associated drag data, and impact
        dispersion data for each jettisoned body. See Attachment 4 of this volume.
        3.1.2.3.2.3. Wind Effects Data. In most cases, wind is the largest independent factor caus-
        ing displacement of unguided vehicle impact points. Accompanied by tabulations, charts,
        and a comprehensive discussion of their formulation, the following data are required to
        predict the magnitude and direction of this effect:
           3.1.2.3.2.3.1. Ballistic wind-weighting factors versus altitude in feet. The effects of
           booster and first-stage wind drifts are of prime importance since the first-stage motor
           impact point is usually near the launch site. The wind-weighting factor shall be pre-
           sented in percent of wind effect for specific wind altitude intervals or for specific alti-
AFSPCMAN 91-710V2 1 JULY 2004                                                                         31


             tude interval as percentage of the total wind effect. The ballistic wind-weighting
             factors shall include the effects of both weather cocking and drift.
             3.1.2.3.2.3.2. Change in the nominal impact point location due to missile weather
             cocking and drift as a result of ballistic winds (head, tail and cross; or resultant wind
             effect). The deviation is required in feet or nautical miles per foot per second of the
             wind. Since deviations vary significantly with a change in launch quadrant elevation
             angle (QE), values shall be supplied in a table of launcher QE versus unit wind effect.
             The table shall cover the range of elevation angles for which launches are to occur with
             an elevation angle interval no greater than 2 degrees and include plus and minus 12
             degrees from the desired resultant QE up to a maximum launcher setting of 88 degrees.
             3.1.2.3.2.3.3. Launcher adjustment curve or launcher tilt effect to correct the launcher
             in azimuth and elevation for wind effects. A discussion of methods to be used in
             adjusting the launcher settings to compensate for winds is required. This data is
             required only if the Range User desires to adjust the launcher azimuth and elevation to
             correct for wind effects and shall be supplied for all desired resultant QEs. Wind com-
             pensation minimizes the area clearance problem by maintaining a constant impact
             point. A thorough description of the correction method and the expected accuracies to
             be achieved are required in addition to the proper curves and tabulation data.
             3.1.2.3.2.3.4. A graphical and tabular presentation of the impact point displacement
             due to earth rotation versus QE. Calculations for this information are based on the lati-
             tude of the launcher and the desired launch azimuth. The table shall cover the range of
             elevation angles for which launches are to occur with an elevation angle interval no
             greater than 2 degrees and include plus and minus 12 degrees from the desired result-
             ant QE up to a maximum of 88 degrees.
             3.1.2.3.2.3.5. When a computer program is used to perform the calculation required
             for adjustment of the launcher in QE and azimuth or to verify the impact predictions of
             all stages, the Range User shall include a discussion of the intended use of the program.
             If the Range User uses one of the computer programs available at the range, Range
             Safety should be consulted to make sure that requirements in 3.1.2.3.2.3.1 are pre-
             sented in a form compatible with the computer input requirements.
          3.1.2.3.2.4. Analyses for Long Range Probes. All analyses for long-range probes (500
          nautical miles plus) shall be calculated using a rotating spherical or ellipsoidal gravity
          field. In contrast to the majority of probe vehicles, long-range probes normally require an
          FTS incorporated into the vehicle. The data requirements are the same as those specified
          for 3.1.2.1 for guided ballistic missiles. A debris risk analysis (3.4) is required to evaluate
          requests to waive the requirement for an FTS on a long-range probe vehicle.
          3.1.2.3.2.5. Trajectory Requirements. See Attachment 1 of this volume.
          3.1.2.3.2.6. Graphs. In addition to the tabular nominal trajectory data, graphs of the fol-
          lowing shall be provided for each stage and payload weight:

                3.1.2.3.2.6.2. Apogee altitude versus launch elevation angle (feet or nautical miles
                versus degrees).
                3.1.2.3.2.6.3. Altitude versus ground range (feet versus feet or nautical miles).
     3.1.2.4. Aerostats and Balloon Systems. These trajectory and performance data requirements
     apply to large unmanned, untethered, and tethered aerostats and balloons. They do not apply to
     small weather balloons and other such objects that are released routinely throughout the country
     and the world for scientific purposes.

                                         TRAJECTORY DATA

A1.1. Introduction. This attachment provides background information and details about Range Safety
trajectory requirements. It is applicable to ballistic, space, cruise, remotely piloted, and small unguided
vehicles. Range Users should contact Range Safety for flight trajectory data preparation, submittal, and
processing. The trajectory and two printouts with a letter of transmittal are required.

A1.2. Trajectory Details:
   A1.2.1. XYZ Coordinates. The X, Y, Z, coordinates referred to in Volume 2 shall be referenced to an
   orthogonal, earth-fixed, left-handed system with its origin at the launch point or at a point on the
   earth's surface above or below the launch point. The XY plane shall be tangent to the ellipsoidal earth
   at the origin, the positive X axis shall coincide with the launch azimuth, and the positive Z axis shall
   be directed away from the earth, and the Y axis shall be positive to the right looking downrange.
   A1.2.2. Trajectory Data Item Requirements. The required trajectories from Table A1.1 through
   Table A1.3 shall be calculated using a 6 degree-of-freedom program. Table A1.4 lists the data items to
   be provided for each required trajectory. The data items are required in 1-second intervals.
       A1.2.2.1. Ballistic Missiles and Space Vehicles. All trajectories except the three-sigma launch
       area trajectories shall be provided from launch up to a point in flight where effective thrust of the
       final stage has terminated, or to thrust termination of that stage or burn that places the vehicle in
       orbit. The launch area trajectories are required from liftoff until the vehicle attains an altitude of
       100,000 ** feet.


 The double asterisks used in this attachment mean that the magnitude, interval, or duration for
 the required item varies from program to program. The value given is typical.

       A1.2.2.2. Cruise Missiles and Remotely Piloted Vehicles. The data items are required in tabu-
       lar form in 1-second intervals for the first 2** minutes of flight, in 15-second** intervals from this
       point until the missile reaches cruise altitude, in 1-minute** intervals throughout the cruise phase
       until the terminal phase of flight is reached, and at 15-second** intervals thereafter until operation
       termination or impact. For each program, Range Safety provides the Range User with the specific
       value to use for each parameter marked with the double asterisks. The time 0.0 seconds shall cor-
       respond to first motion for pad-launched missiles and to the instant of drop for air launches.
       A1.2.2.3. Small Unguided Rockets or Probe Vehicles. Table A1.4 (Items 5 - 13) lists the data
       items to be provided for each trajectory from launch until burnout of the final stage for each
       desired nominal quadrant elevation angle and payload weight. These items shall be provided in
       tabular form as a function of time with each column of the table containing only a single parame-
       ter. Time shall be given at even intervals, not to exceed 1-second increments during thrusting
       flight, and for times corresponding to ignition, thrust termination or burnout, and separation of
       each stage. If stage burning times are less than 4 seconds, time intervals should be reduced to 0.2
       seconds or less.

     A1.2.3. Nominal (Reference) Trajectory. The nominal or reference trajectory is the trajectory that
     the vehicle would fly if all vehicle parameters were exactly as expected, if all vehicle systems per-
     formed exactly as planned, and there were no external perturbing influences.
     A1.2.4. Three-Sigma Dispersed Trajectories. The three-sigma dispersed trajectories define the
     downrange and crossrange limits of normality for the vehicle IIP at any time after launch. The
     three-sigma trajectories shall be computed using annual wind profiles unless the launch is to be con-
     ducted at a particular time of the year and only at that time. Care should be exercised in the selection
     of the cumulative percentage frequency of the wind profile used for the computation of these trajecto-
     ries. Selecting a wind profile as severe as the worst wind conditions when a launch would be
     attempted is usually recommended. In critical instances, this has the disadvantage of limiting the
     allowable launch azimuth or reducing the allowable launch day winds in the flight safety restrictions
     for wind drift of vehicle fragments resulting from FTS action. The flight termination criteria allow for
     as much vehicle deviation due to wind as shown in these trajectories, but do not account for wind con-
     ditions that exceed those used in these computations.

      A1.2.4.1. Generating a Single Composite Three-Sigma Trajectory. To generate a single com-
      posite three-sigma trajectory in terms of instantaneous impact range, the following procedure is
      suggested. If the following procedure is not used, a description of the method used to generate the
      three-sigma trajectories shall be provided.
          A1.2.4.1.1. Step 1: Identify individual parameters such as thrust, weight, specific impulse,
          and atmospheric density that significantly affect the performance of the vehicle IIP. Estimate
          three-sigma dispersions for these parameters.
          A1.2.4.1.2. Step 2: Run a series of trajectory computations or simulations where three-sigma
          values of significant perturbing parameters are introduced one at a time. At a suitable number
          of time points, tabulate the IIP deviations from nominal that have been caused by perturbing
          each parameter.
          A1.2.4.1.3. Step 3: At each time point and direction, calculate the square root of the sum of
          the squares of all deviations to arrive at the three-sigma IIP deviations.
          A1.2.4.1.4. Step 4: By further trajectory computations or simulations, generate a thrusting
          flight trajectory (a three-sigma, no-wind trajectory) that matches as closely as possible the
          three-sigma deviations calculated in Step 3. This may be done by perturbing only a few key
          parameters at varying magnitudes throughout the run.
          A1.2.4.1.5. Step 5: Compute the required three-sigma trajectory using worst case winds
          together with the parameter magnitudes used to calculate the three-sigma, no-wind trajectory.
          The wind dispersed trajectories indicate vehicle performance deviations due to the effects of
          severe winds. This data should be supplied until the vehicle attains an altitude where there is
          essentially no wind effect. It is usually sufficient to use 100,000 feet as this altitude limit.
          Computations should not be limited to wind drift but include all wind effects.
      A1.2.4.2. Three-Sigma Maximum and Minimum Performance Trajectories. T h e t h r e e -
      sigma maximum and three-sigma minimum-performance trajectories define at any time after
      launch the limits of normality as far as impact downrange is concerned. The three-sigma maxi-
      mum-performance trajectory provides the maximum downrange distance of the vacuum IIP for
      any given time and the three-sigma minimum-performance trajectory provides the minimum
      downrange distance of the IIP for any time. In calculating these trajectories, head and tail wind
      profiles should be used that represent the worst wind conditions for which a launch would be
      attempted. For any particular time after launch, approximately 99.73 percent of all normal vehi-
      cles (assuming a normal Gaussian distribution) that are subjected to the assumed wind will have
      impact ranges lying between the extremes achieved at that time by three-sigma maximum perfor-
      mance and three- sigma minimum-performance vehicles. Of the 0.27 percent of the normal vehi-

     cles that fall outside the three-sigma limits, approximately half would be short and half would be
     long. It is recognized that it may not be possible for a normally performing, fully guided vehicle to
     fly either the three-sigma maximum or minimum-performance trajectory as defined above. How-
     ever, what is wanted is a single trajectory having an impact range at any time greater than the
     impact range of 99.865 percent of all normal vehicles, and a single trajectory with an impact range
     at any time less than the impact range of 99.865 percent of all normal vehicles. Any deviation out-
     side of three-sigma limits indicates that the vehicle is probably behaving in an abnormal, though
     not necessarily dangerous, fashion. Those parameters having a significant effect upon impact
     range, such as thrust, specific impulse, weight, variation in firing times of different stages, and
     fuel flow rates, should be combined in the best considered fashion to produce the required results.
        A1.2.4.2.1. Cruise Missiles and Remotely Piloted Vehicles. The three-sigma high perfor-
        mance trajectory should define the vehicle capability limits in climbing to maximum altitude
        at the maximum possible rate. It defines, at any time after launch, the limits of normality as far
        as impact range is concerned. The three-sigma high-performance trajectory provides the max-
        imum downrange distance of the vacuum instantaneous impact point (IIP) for any given time.
        The three-sigma maximum and minimum-altitude trajectories define for any ground range the
        limits of normality as far as altitude is concerned. In other words, for any particular ground
        range approximately 99.73 percent of all normal vehicles (assuming a normal Gaussian distri-
        bution) will have altitudes between the extremes defined by three-sigma maximum altitude
        and three-sigma minimum-altitude trajectories. Any deviation outside these limits indicates
        that the vehicle is behaving in an abnormal, though not necessarily dangerous, fashion. How-
        ever, the Mission Flight Control Officer (MFCO) may destroy such a vehicle if it is approach-
        ing land or threatening to get outside or below the command destruct coverage area.
     A1.2.4.3. Three-Sigma Lateral Trajectory Requirements:
        A1.2.4.3.1. Definition. Three-sigma lateral trajectories define the crossrange limits of nor-
        mality for the vacuum instantaneous impact point (IIP). Both a three-sigma left and a
        three-sigma right trajectory shall be provided. These trajectories should be calculated using the
        worst lateral wind conditions for which a launch would be attempted. For any downrange dis-
        tance, the IIP traces for 99.73 percent of all normal vehicles subjected to the assumed winds lie
        between the three-sigma lateral IIP traces. For variable azimuth launches, a three-sigma left
        trajectory for the smallest flight azimuth in the approved azimuth sector and a three-sigma
        right trajectory for the largest flight azimuth in the approved sector are required in addition to
        three-sigma lateral trajectories for a centrally located flight azimuth. Unless the procedure is
        invalid, the assumption will be made that the three-sigma left and right trajectories provided
        for the centrally located azimuth can be used to produce a reasonable approximation of the
        three-sigma left and right trajectories for other flight azimuths by reorienting the X and Y axis
        of the data. For example, if the three-sigma lateral trajectories have been computed for a cen-
        tral flight azimuth of 100 degrees, the three-sigma lateral trajectories for a 90-degrees flight
        azimuth will be determined simply by assuming that the X axis is 90 degrees instead of 100
        degrees. If this assumption is not reasonable, additional trajectories shall be provided to define
        the extreme left and right lateral limits.
        A1.2.4.3.2. Use. Three-sigma lateral trajectories are needed to determine whether a normal
        vehicle experiencing a three-sigma deviation will violate flight safety destruct criteria. They
        may also be used as guidelines by the MFCO in deciding whether a vehicle will be allowed to
50                                                               AFSPCMAN 91-710V2 1 JULY 2004


        continue in flight or to over fly land. When used for comparison with the impact predictor
        destruct criteria, the vacuum IIP data are required. When used on the present-position display,
        values of X, Y, Z along the three-sigma lateral trajectories are required. The three-sigma lateral
        trajectories, as defined in A1.2.4.2.1. in terms of IIP, may not provide three-sigma deviations
        of the lateral position Y as a function of X, although this is normally assumed to be the case. If
        this assumption is not valid, the Range User should also submit three-sigma trajectories that
        define the lateral limits of Y in terms of X.
        A1.2.4.3.3. Calculation. In calculating a three-sigma lateral trajectory, those parameters hav-
        ing a significant effect on the lateral deviation of the IIP (or of the position Y in terms of X)
        should be combined in the best considered fashion to produce the required results. The proce-
        dures described in A1.2.4 and A1.2.4.1 for calculating three-sigma maximum and mini-
        mum-performance trajectories are also suggested here.
        A1.2.4.3.4. Cruise Missiles and Remotely Piloted Vehicles. The three-sigma lateral trajec-
        tory defines the lateral limits within which 99.73 percent of all normal missiles are expected to
        remain. This trajectory should be calculated using the worst lateral wind condition for which a
        launching would be attempted. Since only one three-sigma lateral trajectory is requested, the
        assumption will be made that the three-sigma left and three-sigma right trajectories are sym-
        metric about the nominal trajectory. If this assumption is not reasonable, then both three-sigma
        left and three-sigma right trajectories shall be provided. A missile that deviates outside the
        three- sigma lateral limits is subject to possible destruction if it is approaching land or threat-
        ening to get outside or below the command destruct coverage area.
     A1.2.4.4. Dispersed Launch Area Trajectories. If the dispersed launch area trajectories are
     computed as specified and the proposed flight plan is approved, the launch agency can be certain
     that a normal vehicle will not violate the safety destruct criteria in the launch area, irrespective of
     the actual winds existing at launch. Unfortunately, there is also a distinct disadvantage in using
     extreme winds to calculate the dispersed trajectories. To arrive at destruct lines that will not be
     violated by vehicles flying the extreme trajectories, the allowances made for wind effects in the
     destruct line computations must be kept small. This, in turn, means that wind restrictions must be
     imposed on launch day. The wind profile used in the destruct calculations may be much smaller
     than the extreme wind profiles used to calculate the dispersed trajectories. In general, the greater
     the wind profile used in calculating the dispersed launch area trajectories, the steeper the trajecto-
     ries are; and the steeper the dispersed trajectories, the more severe the Range Safety wind restric-
     tion must be on launch day to have acceptable destruct criteria. Reducing the wind profile in
     calculating the dispersed trajectories lessens the probability of a hold due to wind, but increases
     the probability that a normal vehicle will fly outside the limits defined by the dispersed trajecto-
     ries. This, in turn, increases the probability that a normal vehicle will be destroyed. For those vehi-
     cle flights for which severe launch area wind restrictions are required, it may be necessary for the
     Range User to supply dispersed launch area trajectories for two or three different wind profiles.
     By so doing, the probability of a safety hold due to wind is thus reduced.
        A1.2.4.4.1. Three-Sigma Steep Launch Area Trajectory. The three-sigma steep launch
        area trajectory should maximize Z as a function of X', where the azimuth of the X' axis must
        be specified by Range Safety for each program or group of similar flights. The positive X' axis
        is directed downrange from the launch point directly away from the uprange impact limit line
        so the negative X' axis intersects the impact limit line at right angles. In calculating this trajec-
AFSPCMAN 91-710V2 1 JULY 2004                                                                            51


        tory a head wind (or tail wind) blowing toward (or away from) the impact limit line, that is,
        blowing from (or toward) the positive X' direction, normally is used. This wind profile should,
        but may not always, represent the worst conditions for which a launch would be attempted.
        Therefore, other wind azimuths may need to be examined for worst conditions depending on
        the particular vehicle’s guidance system response to wind direction. If other perturbing factors
        such as gyro drift or high thrust add significantly to the uprange deviations caused by wind,
        these factors should also be included in the calculations. The steep launch area trajectory is a
        three-sigma trajectory in that, for any X', the value of Z along the three-sigma steepest trajec-
        tory would be greater than the corresponding values of Z achieved by 99.865 percent of all
        normal missiles subjected to the assumed head wind.
        A1.2.4.4.2. Three-Sigma Lateral Launch Area Trajectory. The three-sigma lateral launch
        area trajectory should maximize Z as a function of Y', where the azimuth of the Y' axis must
        be specified by the Flight Safety Analysis Section for each program or group of similar flights.
        When looking down-range, the negative Y' axis is laterally directed to the right with respect to
        the intended flight line, the actual direction being perpendicular to the lateral impact limit line
        being protected. In calculating this trajectory, a lateral wind blowing toward (or away from)
        the impact limit line, that is, blowing from (or toward) the positive Y' direction normally is
        used. This wind profile should, but may not always, represent the worst conditions for which a
        launch would be attempted. Therefore, other wind azimuths may need to be examined for
        worst conditions depending on the particular vehicle’s guidance system response to wind
        direction. Other perturbing factors that add significantly to the vehicle lateral movement, such
        as gyro drift, roll program error, and alignment errors, should also be included in the calcula-
        tions. The lateral launch area trajectory is a three-sigma trajectory in that, for any Y', the value
        of Z along the three-sigma lateral launch area trajectory would be greater than the correspond-
        ing values of Z achieved by 99.865 percent of all normal missiles subjected to the assumed lat-
        eral wind.
     A1.2.4.5. Fuel-Exhaustion Trajectory. For many flights, a programmed thrust termination may
     be scheduled well in advance of fuel exhaustion. To know whether a potential safety problem can
     arise if the vehicle should fail to cut off, trajectory data through fuel exhaustion are needed. For
     ballistic missile flights, the information should be provided only for the last stage in accordance
     with assumptions mutually agreed to by the Range User and Range Safety. For orbital flights, the
     fuel exhaustion trajectory should be provided for the last suborbital stage. The requirement should
     be met by extending either the nominal or three-sigma maximum-performance trajectory through
     fuel exhaustion, depending on which produces a greater impact range.
        A1.2.4.5.1. Cruise Missiles and Remotely Piloted Vehicles. In calculating this trajectory, a
        tail-wind profile should be used that represents the worst wind conditions for which a launch-
        ing would be attempted. For any particular time after launch, approximately 99.73 percent of
        all normal vehicles (assuming a normal Gaussian distribution) will have impact ranges less
        than the range achieved at that time by a three-sigma high performance mission.

                                             ATTACHMENT 2

                                      MALFUNCTION TURN DATA

A2.1. Introduction. This attachment provides background information and details about Range Safety
malfunction turn data requirements. It is applicable to ballistic, space, cruise, and remotely piloted vehi-
cles. The turn data shall describe the turning capability of the vehicle velocity vector as a function of
thrust vector offset or other parameters characterizing the turns. This information is used to determine
how fast a vehicle or, more exactly, a vehicle impact point can deviate from the nominal if a malfunction
occurs. Velocity vector turn data is required only for the thrusting periods from launch up to a point in
flight where effective thrust of the final stage has terminated or to thrust termination of that stage or burn
that places the vehicle in orbit.

A2.2. Turn Definitions:
     A2.2.1. Yaw turn - the angle turned in the lateral direction by the total velocity vector. The lateral
     plane is defined as the plane normal to the vector generated by the cross-product of the unit vectors of
     the total velocity and the normal to the nominal trajectory plane, not the angle turned in the horizontal
     plane by the horizontal component.
     A2.2.2. Maximum turn capability - the envelope of the maximum-rate trim and all tumble velocity
     vector turn angle curves for a given malfunction time, irrespective of how unlikely this rate is to occur.
     A2.2.3. Trim turn - a turn resulting from a malfunction that causes the launch vehicle thrust moment
     to balance the aerodynamic moment while imparting a constant rotation rate to the vehicle longitudi-
     nal axis. The maximum-rate trim turn is the trim turn made at or near the greatest angle of attack that
     can be maintained while the aerodynamic moment is just balanced by the thrust moment, whether the
     vehicle is stable or unstable.
     A2.2.4. Tumble turn - the family of tumble turns that results if the airframe rotates in an uncontrolled
     fashion at various angular rates, each rate being brought about by a different, constant value of the
     thrust vector offset angle or constant value of another parameter that defines the tumble turn.
     A2.2.5. 90-degree option - the turn produced by directing and maintaining the vehicle thrust at about
     90 degrees to the velocity vector without regard for how this situation can be brought about.

A2.3. Malfunction Turn Computation Requirements:
     A2.3.1. Turning information need be computed for the nominal or reference trajectory only.
     A2.3.2. In the various velocity vector turn computations, it should be assumed that the vehicle perfor-
     mance is normal up to the point of the malfunction that produces the turn.
     A2.3.3. The effects of gravity shall be omitted from the final turn data calculations.
     A2.3.4. If pitch and yaw turn angles are essentially the same except for the effects of gravity, the yaw
     turn angles may be determined from pitch calculations that, in effect, have had the gravity component
     subtracted out at each step in the computations.
     A2.3.5. During the first 100** seconds of flight both pitch and yaw turns shall be provided. After
     100** seconds, turns need be computed only in the yaw plane. For each program, Range Safety pro-
     vides the Range User with the specific value to use for each parameter marked with the double aster-
AFSPCMAN 91-710V2 1 JULY 2004                                                                              53


   isks. Exception: During the first 100** seconds of flight, when neglecting gravity, if the pitch and yaw
   turns are the same, only the yaw turns are required.


 The double asterisks used in this attachment mean the magnitude, interval, or duration for the
 required item varies from program to program. The value given is typical.

   A2.3.6. Malfunction turn data are required for malfunctions initiated at even 4** second intervals
   beginning 4** seconds after first motion continuing for the first 100** seconds of flight or through the
   first-stage thrusting phase and into the second-stage phase for at least one time point, and at even 8**
   second intervals thereafter.
   A2.3.7. One possible difficulty needs to be mentioned in connection with calculating tumble turns for
   aerodynamically unstable missiles. In the high aerodynamic region, it often turns out that no matter
   how small the initial deflection of the rocket engine, the airframe tumbles through 180 degrees or
   one-half cycle in less than the specified time period for which the calculations are to be carried out. In
   such a case, if the computation is carried out for the specified time period, part of the angle turned by
   the velocity vector during the first half cycle is then canceled out during the second half cycle of the
   turn. If only tumble turns were considered in such cases, the conclusion would be reached that the
   vehicle velocity vector can turn through a greater angle in a shorter time period than it can in a longer
   time period. This is an unacceptable conclusion from a safety viewpoint. The envelope of the family
   of tumble turns must rise continuously throughout the specified malfunction time period. One gener-
   ally acceptable way to satisfy this requirement is to compute tumble turn angles without considering
   aerodynamic forces. Although such a vacuum turn cannot actually be simulated in the atmosphere by
   means of a constant engine deflection, in all likelihood there is some particular intelligent behavior of
   the engine that can approximate the turn fairly closely. If, however, vacuum tumble turns are consid-
   ered unrealistic and unjustifiable, other types of malfunctions shall be considered.
   A2.3.8. The turn data shall be defined for a series of malfunction modes such as thrust vector offset.
   Turn data computations shall include a credible distribution (range) of parameter values to demon-
   strate the variation of the turn characteristics caused by each malfunction mode. If the turns can occur
   as a function of more than one malfunction mode (for example, solid rocket motor (SRM) thrust vec-
   tor offset angle for thrust vector control failures and thrust dissipation time for SRM nozzle burn
   through), turn data are required for each mode. Where possible, the same set of malfunction modes
   shall be used for each turn initiation time.

A2.4. Turn Trajectories. Although velocity vector turning computations are not required for the
three-sigma maximum and three-sigma minimum performance trajectories, a method for applying the
turn angles to these trajectories shall be provided. The trajectory data items of A1.2.2 shall also be applied
for the trajectory used to start the turn computations, if this trajectory is not one of those provided in
response to A1.2.1. Range Users should contact Range Safety regarding data format requirements. A
columnar or block printout is acceptable. In addition, a complete discussion is required of assumptions
made, methods of calculation, and equations used in deriving the malfunction turns.

A2.5. Determining Types of Turns to Submit. In determining the maximum turn capability of a vehi-
cle, the usual procedure is for the Range User to consider both trim turns and tumble turns, in both the
pitch and yaw planes. However, with Range Safety approval, the Range User may elect to calculate turn
rates using the 90-degree option in lieu of trim and tumble turns. If the 90-degree option is ruled out, the
54                                                                   AFSPCMAN 91-710V2 1 JULY 2004


criteria for each of the vehicle conditions listed in A2.5.2 through A2.5.4 should be used to determine
whether trim turns, tumble turns, or both should be provided at each turn initiation time.
     A2.5.1. 90-Degree Option. In some cases, Range Safety may accept turning angles or rates com-
     puted on the basis of the 90-degree assumption even though it is extremely unlikely for the missile to
     achieve these turn rates. This option is usually quite disadvantageous to the Range User, since larger
     turning angles (higher turn rates) lead to more restrictive destruct criteria. Such unduly restrictive cri-
     teria could necessitate the revision of a proposed flight plan that may otherwise have been allowed or
     could result in somewhat earlier destruction of an erratic missile.
     A2.5.2. Condition 1: For Vehicles Aerodynamically Unstable at All Angles of Attack. During that
     part of flight where the maximum trim angle of attack is small, it may be obvious that tumble turns
     lead to greater turning angles. If the maximum trim angle of attack is large, trim turns will in all prob-
     ability lead to higher turning angles than tumble turns and to more restrictive destruct criteria.
        A2.5.2.1. If the Range User can state that the probability of flying a trim turn even for a period of
        only a few seconds is virtually zero, only tumble turns are required.
        A2.5.2.2. If the Range User cannot so state, a series of trim turns (that includes the maximum-rate
        trim turn) and the family of tumble turns shall be provided.
     A2.5.3. Condition 2: For Vehicles Stable at All Angles of Attack:
        A2.5.3.1. If the vehicle is so stable that the maximum thrust moment cannot produce tumbling,
        but produces a maximum-rate trim turn at some angle of attack less than 90 degrees, a series of
        trim turns that includes the maximum-rate trim turn shall be provided.
        A2.5.3.2. If the maximum thrust moment results in a maximum-rate trim turn at some angle of
        attack greater than 90 degrees, a series of trim turns shall be provided only for angles of attack up
        to and including 90 degrees.
     A2.5.4. Condition 3: For Vehicles Unstable at Low Angles of Attack but Stable at Some Higher
     Angle of Attack Region:
        A2.5.4.1. If large engine deflections result in tumbling, whereas small engine deflections do not,
        a series of trim and tumble turns should be generated as prescribed in A2.5.2 for aerodynamically
        unstable missiles. The same difficulty discussed in A2.3.5 with tumble turns may arise here;
        namely, the envelope of the computed tumble turns may fail to rise continuously throughout the
        entire time period for which the calculations are to be carried out. In this event, either tumble-turn
        calculations neglecting aerodynamic forces or trim-turn calculations must be made as discussed in
        A2.5.2.
        A2.5.4.2. If both large and small constant engine deflections result in tumbling, irrespective of
        how small the deflection might be, the turn data achieved at the stability angle of attack, assuming
        no upsetting thrust moment, are required in addition to the turn data achieved by a tumbling vehi-
        cle. This situation arises because the stability at high angles of attack is insufficient to arrest the
        angular velocity that is built up during the initial part of a tumble turn where the vehicle is unsta-
        ble. Although the missile cannot arrive at this stability angle of attack as a result of the constant
        engine deflection, there is some deflection behavior that will produce this result. If arriving at such
        a deflection program is too difficult or too time consuming, it may be assumed that the vehicle
        somehow instantaneously rotated to the trim angle of attack and stabilizes at this point. If so, tum-
AFSPCMAN 91-710V2 1 JULY 2004                                                                              55


       ble turn angles may be used in Range Safety destruct calculations during that part of flight for
       which the envelope rises continuously for the duration of the computation.

A2.6. Turn Duration. The malfunction turn data (turn angle and velocity magnitude curves) are to be
provided at 1**second intervals, for at least 12** seconds into the turn and until one of the following two
conditions are met. Various time intervals or time delays shall be considered, since the delays that are built
into the Range Safety destruct calculations depend upon the accuracy, sensitivity, and type of presentation
associated with a particular instrumentation system as well as missile characteristics.
   A2.6.1. The vehicle reaches a critical loading condition that will cause breakup.
   A2.6.2. The vehicle is tumbling so rapidly that the effective thrust acceleration is negligible; for
   example, the projected vacuum impact point is no longer moving significantly.

A2.7. Turn Data Format. Malfunction turn data shall be delivered in the form of graphs. Scale factors
of plots shall be selected so the plotting and reading accuracies do not degrade the basic accuracy of the
data. In addition, tabular listings of the data used to generate the graphs are required in ASCII format files
on floppy or compact disks or other electronic media, with corresponding hard copies.
   A2.7.1. Velocity Turn Angle Graphs. For turn angle graphs, the ordinate represents the total angle
   turned by the velocity vector in degrees; and the abscissa, the time duration of the turn in seconds.
   A2.7.2. Velocity Magnitude Graphs. For velocity magnitude graphs, the ordinate represents the
   magnitude of the velocity vector in feet per second; and the abscissa, the time duration of the turn in
   seconds.

A2.8. Turn Data Items. The following data items are required for each malfunction initiation time. The
information that describes the turn is required at intervals of 1 second or less.
   A2.8.1. Velocity Turn Angle. One graph is required for each malfunction mode at each initiation
   time. For tumble turns, each graph is to include the envelope of all tumble turns for all possible con-
   stant thrust vector offset angles (or other parameter). In this case, plots of the individual tumble turn
   curves that are used to define the envelope are required on the same sheet with the envelope. For trim
   turns, a series of trim turn curves for representative values of thrust vector offset (or other parameter)
   is required. The series of trim turn curves shall include the maximum-rate trim turn.
   A2.8.2. Velocity Magnitude. Either total velocity magnitude or incremental change in velocity mag-
   nitude from time of malfunction can be presented although the incremental change in the velocity is
   desired. For each thrust vector offset angle (or other parameter), the point on the velocity graph corre-
   sponding to the point of tangency on the tumble turn-angle envelope shall be indicated. For tumble
   turns, velocity magnitudes are required in graphical form as a function of time for each thrust vector
   offset (or other parameter) used to define the tumble turn envelope.
   A2.8.3. Vehicle Orientation. If the vehicle has thrust augmenting rocket motors, then the vehicle
   attitude (in the form of the angular orientation of the vehicle longitudinal axis) as a function of time
   into the turn is required for each turn initiation time.
   A2.8.4. Onset Conditions. The vehicle state at the beginning of the turn, including the thrust,
   weight, and state vector (including velocity magnitude) shall be provided for each set of curves.
56                                                                  AFSPCMAN 91-710V2 1 JULY 2004


     A2.8.5. Breakup Information. The Range User shall specify if the vehicle will remain intact
     throughout the turn. If the vehicle will breakup during a turn, then the point (time) for which vehicle
     breakup is expected to occur shall be indicated. The time into the turn at which vehicle breakup would
     occur can be a specific value or a probability distribution for time to breakup.
     A2.8.6. Probability of Occurrence. The distribution for the probability of occurrence for the value
     of the parameter defining the turns, such as thrust vector offset, shall be defined for each parameter (as
     a function of turn initiation time if the distribution varies with time). Also, information defining how
     the probability distribution was determined shall be provided.

A2.9. Velocity Vector Turn Data for Cruise Missiles and Remotely Piloted Vehicles:
     A2.9.1. From launch or drop until cruise altitude is reached, this information is required to provide a
     means of determining the maximum angle through which the missile velocity vector can turn in the
     event of a malfunction. The maximum angles turned for time intervals up to about 30** seconds in
     duration are required. (The actual times will depend on the delays included in the FTS as well as other
     factors). Both pitch and yaw turns should be investigated and the larger presented. It should be
     assumed that the missile has followed the nominal trajectory up to the point of malfunction that pro-
     duces the maximum-rate trim turn. Thereafter, it should be assumed that the missile is trimmed to the
     maximum air load that the structure can stand, or that the missile is flying out of control in an attitude
     that produces maximum lateral acceleration (for example, a near 90-degree bank with a maximum
     pitch turn). During the launch phase, the missile may not be able to fly for 30** seconds under these
     extreme conditions. In this event, it should be assumed that the missile is turning at the maximum rate
     for which these flight conditions can be maintained for required time duration. A complete discussion
     of the methods used in the calculations shall be provided. This discussion should include assumptions
     made, types of malfunctions considered, forces producing turns, equations used, and sample computa-
     tions.
     A2.9.2. During the cruise phase, the maximum turn capability of the velocity vector as a function of
     altitude is required. Rates should be based on normal missile weights and the expected cruising speeds
     at each altitude. For this phase of flight, the data may be expressed in the form of maximum lateral
     accelerations, if desired. A complete discussion similar to that requested for A2.9.1 is required. Also
     required is the maximum turn capability that the guidance system and the autopilot can command dur-
     ing the cruise phase.
     A2.9.3. A cruise missile may be boosted from the launch pad by separable rockets or by a booster
     motor that is an integral part of the missile. While the booster motor is thrusting, the missile may per-
     form more as a ballistic missile or space vehicle than as a cruise missile. In such cases, maximum
     turning capability data during the boost phase will be required as specified in A2.5 rather than as spec-
     ified in A2.9.1. For each missile program, Range Safety shall indicate which procedures are to be used
     in computing malfunction turn data during the boost phase.

                                          FRAGMENT DATA

A3.1. Introduction. Fragment listings and characteristics for all potential modes of vehicle breakup are
required. At a minimum, the following modes of vehicle breakup shall be considered: (1) breakup due to
FTS activation, (2) breakup due to an explosion, and (3) breakup due to aerodynamic loads, inertial loads,
and atmospheric reentry heating. Fragment data is required up to thrust termination of the last stage that
carries a destruct system. All fragments shall be included; however, similar fragments can be accounted
for in fragment groups.

A3.2. Describing Fragment Groups. A fragment group is one or more fragments whose characteristics
are similar enough to allow all the fragments to be described by a single “average” set of characteristics.
The following information is provided to aid in determining fragment groups:
   A3.2.1. Fragment Type. All fragments shall be of the same type (for example solid propellant, explo-
   sive, or inert), including whether or not propellant fragments are burning following breakup.
   A3.2.2. Ballistic Coefficient (beta). The maximum beta in the group should be no more than about a
   factor of 3 times the minimum (except for very low beta fragments where betas ranging from near 0 to
   about 3 pounds per square foot [lb/ft2] can be grouped together).
   A3.2.3. Weight. If the fragments contain propellant that is burning during free fall, the maximum
   weight of propellant in a fragment group should be no more than a factor of 1.2 times the minimum
   weight of propellant. The fragments included in a group should be such that the kinetic energies (KE)
   based on terminal velocity (KE = 13 x W x beta, foot pounds force {ft-lbf} [The 13 has units of ft3/
   lbf]) are within the following guidelines:
       A3.2.3.1. Fragments having KE < 35 are grouped.
       A3.2.3.2. Fragments having 35 < KE < 100 are grouped.
       A3.2.3.3. Fragments having 100 < KE < 6,200 should be grouped so that the maximum fragment
       KE is no more than about three times the minimum.
       A3.2.3.4. Fragments having 6,200 < KE < 33,670 should be grouped so that the maximum frag-
       ment KE is no more than about three times the minimum.
       A3.2.3.5. Fragments having 33,670 < KE < 74,000 should be grouped so that the maximum frag-
       ment KE is no more than about three times the minimum.
       A3.2.3.6. Fragments having 74,000 < KE < 1,616,000 should be grouped so that the maximum
       fragment KE is no more than about three times the minimum.
       A3.2.3.7. Fragments having KE > 1,616,000 are grouped.
   A3.2.4. Velocity Perturbation. The maximum expected destruct explosion or pressure rupture
   induced velocity in the group should be no more than a factor of 1.2 times the minimum induced
   velocity.
   A3.2.5. Projected Area. For explosive fragments, the range of projected areas should be controlled by
   requiring that the maximum value of the weight of propellant at impact is no more than a factor of two
58                                                                   AFSPCMAN 91-710V2 1 JULY 2004


     times the minimum; however, if the propellant is burning during free fall the factor is 1.2. There is no
     limit on the range of projected areas for inert fragments.

A3.3. Fragment Data Items. These requirements provide a description of the data items required for
each fragment or fragment group for each potential mode of vehicle breakup. The variation of the frag-
ment characteristics with flight time shall be defined. Normally this is accomplished by specifying multi-
ple fragment lists, each of which is applicable over a specified period of flight.
     A3.3.1. That fragment that, in the absence of winds, is expected to travel a maximum distance, and
     that fragment(s) that, in the absence of winds, is expected to travel a minimum distance shall be
     included.
     A3.3.2. Fragment group name.
     A3.3.3. Number of fragments.
     A3.3.4. General description(s) of fragments such as part/component, shape, dimensions, figure.
     A3.3.5. Breakup Altitude. For breakup due to atmospheric reentry, the altitude at which breakup is
     expected to occur shall be provided.
     A3.3.6. Ballistic Coefficient (beta). Nominal, plus three-sigma, and minus three-sigma values (psf)
     for each fragment or group; including graphs of the coefficient of drag (Cd) versus Mach number for
     the nominal and three-sigma beta variations for each fragment or group. Each graph shall be labeled
     with the shape represented by the curve and reference area used to develop the curve. A Cd versus
     Mach curve for axial, transverse, and tumble orientations (when applicable) shall be provided for frag-
     ments not expected to stabilize during free-fall conditions. For fragments that may stabilize during
     free-fall, Cd versus Mach curves should be provided for the stability angle of attack. If the angle of
     attack where the fragment stabilizes is other than 0 degrees, both the coefficient of lift (CL) versus
     Mach number and the Cd versus Mach number curves should be provided. If available, equations for
     Cd versus Mach curves should be provided. The difficulty of estimating drag coefficient curves and
     weights for vehicle pieces is fully realized. If this cannot be done satisfactorily, an estimate of the sub-
     sonic and supersonic W/ Cd A for each major piece may be provided instead. In either case,
     three-sigma tolerance limits shall be included for the drag coefficients for the maximum and mini-
     mum-distance pieces.
     A3.3.7. Weight per Fragment. Include the possible three-sigma weight (pounds) variation for the
     fragment or group. The fragment data shall approximately add up to the total weight of inert material
     in the vehicle plus the weight of contained liquid propellants and solid propellant that is not consumed
     in the initial breakup and/or conflagration.
     A3.3.8. Projected Area per Fragment (ft2). Include the axial, transverse, and tumbling area for the
     fragment or group. This information is not required for those fragment groups classed as uncontained
     propellant fragments (as described below).
     A3.3.9. Estimates of the maximum incremental velocities (feet/seconds) imparted to the vehicle
     pieces due to FTS activation, explosive and/or overpressure loads at breakup. The velocity is normally
     assumed to be Maxwellian distributed with the specified maximum value equal to the 97th percentile.
     If the distribution is known to be significantly different than the Maxwellian, the correct distribution
     is required, including if the specified value should be interpreted as a fixed value with no uncertainty.

   A3.3.10. Fragment Group Type:
       A3.3.10.1. Type 1 = inert fragments; for example, no volatile type material that could be burning
       or could explode.
       A3.3.10.2. Type 2 = uncontained solid propellant fragments; for example, solid propellant
       exposed directly to the atmosphere and will not explode upon impact.
       A3.3.10.3. Type 3 = contained propellant fragments; for example, propellant that is enclosed in a
       container, such as a motor case or pressure vessel, and will not explode upon impact.
       A3.3.10.4. Type 4 = contained explosive propellant fragments; for example, propellant that is
       enclosed in a container, such as motor case or pressure vessel, and will explode upon impact.
       A3.3.10.5. Type 5 = uncontained explosive solid propellant fragments; for example, solid propel-
       lant exposed directly to the atmosphere and will explode upon impact.
   A3.3.11. Casualty Area per Fragment (ft2). The casualty area per fragment shall be based on a frag-
   ment falling vertically at impact, and should reflect the credible fragment orientation giving the max-
   imum projected area.
   A3.3.12. Vehicle stage where fragment group originated.
   A3.3.13. For those fragment groups defined as uncontained propellant fragments, contained propel-
   lant fragments, and explosive fragments, an indication as to whether or not the propellant fragments
   are burning during free fall.
   A3.3.14. For those fragment groups defined as contained propellant fragments, explosive or
   non-explosive, the initial weight of contained propellant (pounds) and the consumption rate during
   free fall (pounds per second); the initial weight of the propellant in a contained propellant fragment is
   the weight of the propellant before and after the anomalous event.
   A3.3.15. Diffusion and dispersion of any fragments containing toxic or radioactive materials and the
   radiation and exposure characteristics.

A3.4. Residual Thrust Dispersion. If an upper stage can be ignited as a result of FTS activation on a
lower stage, sufficient information is required to evaluate the effects and duration of thrust, and the max-
imum deviation of the impact point that can be brought about by this thrust. The explosion effects on
remaining fuels, pressurized tanks, and remaining stages are required, particularly with respect to ignition
or detonation of upper stages if destruct action is taken during the burning period of a lower stage. For
each thrusting or non-thrusting stage having residual thrust capability following FTS activation, provide
either the total residual impulse (pounds-seconds) imparted after "arm" and "destruct," or the full-residual
thrust (pounds-feet) versus time (s). Otherwise, a detailed analysis that clearly shows the stages are not
capable of thrusting after FTS activation is required.

                                        JETTISONED BODY DATA

A4.1. General Data Requirements. The following data shall be provided for each jettisoned body:
     A4.1.1. The nominal impact point. The nominal impact point (or aiming point) for each jettisoned
     body shall be given in terms of geodetic latitude and longitude in decimal degrees, and range (nautical
     miles) from the pad. Computations shall be made for an ellipsoidal rotating earth taking into account
     drag and, if applicable, lift.
     A4.1.2. The number of fragments resulting from a specific scheduled jettison. If the jettisoned body
     is expected to break up during reentry, an estimate of the number of pieces, their approximate weights,
     cross-sectional areas, ballistic coefficients and their impact ranges are required.
     A4.1.3. Jettison flight time (seconds), total weight (pounds) jettisoned and weight per fragment
     (pounds), reference area per fragment (ft2), and the best estimate of Cd versus Mach number and sub-
     sonic and supersonic ballistic coefficient for each stage or piece. The Cd versus Mach number data are
     to be provided in graphical and tabular format for the nominal, minus three-sigma and plus
     three-sigma drag coefficients and shall cover the range of possible Mach numbers from 0 to the max-
     imum values expected during free fall. Also indicate whether bodies are stable and, if so, at what
     angles of attack. For pieces that can possibly stabilize during free flight, drag coefficient curves shall
     be provided for the stability angle of attack. If the stability angle of attack is other than 0 degrees, both
     coefficient of lift (CL) versus Mach number and Cd versus Mach number curves shall be provided.
     State briefly how drag curves were determined.
     A4.1.4. The three-sigma uprange-downrange (nautical miles) and crossrange (nautical miles) impact
     dispersions and the azimuth orientation of the dispersion major axis (degrees clockwise from true
     North), assuming a normally functioning vehicle. Three-sigma wind effects acting upon the descend-
     ing body or pieces shall be included in the dispersion area. A brief discussion of the method used to
     determine dispersions is also required. The magnitude of the wind contribution in the total dispersions
     is required.
     A4.1.5. The resultant ballistic coefficient at time of debris impact.
     A4.1.6. Maximum possible impact range of each impacting stage or reentry vehicle for a missile
     burning to fuel exhaustion.

A4.2. Reentry Vehicle Data. The items below are required as part of the trajectory or with general vehi-
cle data:
     A4.2.1. Type of reentry vehicle (RV) heat protection (ablation or heat sink); if ablation, provide abla-
     tion tables. The ablation table is a listing of Mach number or altitude versus the ratio W/Wo, where W
     equals the instantaneous RV weight during reentry and Wo equals the vehicle weight before ablation.
     A4.2.2. The RV weight before ablation.
     A4.2.3. A table of RV drag coefficient versus Mach number.
     A4.2.4. A table of RV drag coefficient as a function of altitude.
     A4.2.5. RV aerodynamic reference area associated with the drag coefficients.
AFSPCMAN 91-710V2 1 JULY 2004                                                                           61


A4.3. Small Unguided Rockets and Probe Vehicles. Three-sigma range and cross-range dispersions
are required for each stage, separable fragment or component, and payload. Since the magnitude of these
dispersions may determine whether a destruct system deviation equivalent level of safety certification or
waiver will be granted or the extent to which shipping must be clear of impact areas, a careful analysis is
essential.
   A4.3.1. The following factors should be considered in determining three-sigma impact dispersions
   about predicted impact points:
       A4.3.1.1. Variation in thrust.
       A4.3.1.2. Error in drag estimates.
       A4.3.1.3. Thrust misalignment.
       A4.3.1.4. Fin and body misalignment.
       A4.3.1.5. Variation in weight.
       A4.3.1.6. Variation in ignition times of stages.
       A4.3.1.7. Impulse errors.
       A4.3.1.8. Tip-off and separation perturbations.
       A4.3.1.9. Errors in wind velocity measurements.
       A4.3.1.10. Errors in launcher setting.
       A4.3.1.11. Other significant perturbing influences, such as wind effects .
   A4.3.2. The three-sigma variation in each factor shall be provided in tabular format in addition to the
   extent to which each factor displaces the impact point of each stage in the downrange and crossrange
   directions. Then, total impact dispersion is computed by a statistical combination of the individual
   displacements.
   A4.3.3. A brief discussion of the assumptions made, method of analysis, and method of computation
   is required. The extent to which the three-sigma impact dispersion areas change with quadrant eleva-
   tion angle is also required.
