                                            Chapter 1

                                       INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose. The purpose of the AF OEH Program is to protect health while enhancing combat
and operational capabilities. The program is designed to mitigate OEH-related health risks
through the optimum application of Aerospace Medicine capabilities. It seeks to identify, assess
and eliminate or control health hazards associated with day-to-day operations across the full life-
cycle of acquisition, sustainment and support for weapons systems, munitions and other materiel
systems. The OEH program is a key component of the AF ESOH program as directed in AFPD
90-8.
1.2. Overview.
   1.2.1. Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 6055.1, Safety and Occupational Health
   (SOH) Program as implemented by AFPD 91-3, Occupational Safety and Health and AFI
   91-301, requires that every employee be provided with a work environment that is free from
   recognized hazards that cause or are likely to cause death, injury or illness. To ensure this
   objective is achieved, OEH hazards must be effectively anticipated, identified, evaluated, and
   controlled to enhance workforce availability and mission capability. Consistent, meaningful
   OEH assessment programs must be implemented to ensure exposures are adequately
   controlled to protect the health of DoD personnel. Commanders, civilian leaders and
   workplace supervisors, at each management level, are required to advocate for and
   demonstrate a leadership commitment to a strong OEH program, provide all personnel safe
   and healthy working conditions which prevent illness and injuries. An effective OEH
   program uses active hazard prevention and controls, and provides education and training that
   will enable personnel to recognize and prevent OEH-related injuries and illnesses. It is vitally
   important that OEH concerns and deficiencies be communicated to the acquisition
   community to inform new or modified systems designs, mitigate OEH risks and preclude
   recurrence of these issues. Finally, every Airman, which includes all civilian employees, has
   a responsibility to actively participate in their organization’s OEH program.
   1.2.2. This Instruction serves as the foundational document for the overall AF OEH
   Program. The specific program execution requirements are contained in supporting AF
   Manuals. This Instruction outlines standard procedures to effectively capture, analyze,
   document, and communicate information regarding OEH hazards and risks in the workplace.
   A workplace is defined as any environment where a potential OEH exposure may occur. A
   workplace may be administrative, industrial, or inclusive, to include living quarters.
   Operational considerations such as mission requirements and resource constraints, especially
   in deployed environments, may necessitate deviation from some organizational structures
   and processes outlined in this AFI. However, the OEH hazard identification, risk assessment
   and documentation process outlined in this AFI should be identical in both home station and
   deployed settings. This facilitates the establishment of an accurate longitudinal exposure
   record (LER) in accordance with Presidential Review Directive 5, Improving the Health of
   Our Military, Veterans, and Their Families. In addition, DoDI 6490.03, Deployment Health
   requires the creation and maintenance of an exposure assessment record for each DoD
   member’s full career. More specifically, requirements outlined in this AFI relative to ESOH
 6                                                           AFI48-145_ANGSUP 2 JUNE 2014


     Council, OEH Working Group and OEH Program planning, execution, monitoring,
     measuring, assessing and management review do not apply in deployed environments. This
     Instruction also provides guidance regarding the responsibility of AF occupational medicine
     to advise workers and supervisors regarding worker medical fitness to safely perform
     essential job functions.
     1.2.3. The role of Aerospace Medicine relative to human occupational and environmental
     health focuses on health risk assessment (HRA) and associated health monitoring, sampling,
     and surveillance of actual and potential physical, chemical, biological and radiological
     hazards, man-made and naturally occurring, in the workplace and community environment.
     There are parts of the workplace and community environments that can be reasonably
     modified by short-term and long-term interventions to prevent or reduce human health
     impact and there are aspects of the natural environment that cannot. Aerospace Medicine
     personnel must take this under consideration when planning and executing an OEH HRA.
        1.2.3.1. Examples of environmental factors suited to short- and long-term interventions
        are the modifiable aspects or impacts to human health of:
            1.2.3.1.1. Air, water and soil impacted by biological, chemical or radiological agents.
            1.2.3.1.2. Ionizing radiation, electromagnetic fields and noise.
            1.2.3.1.3. Built environments, including industrial and administrative workplaces,
            facilities intended for community use and housing.
            1.2.3.1.4. Behavior related to the availability of safe water and sanitation facilities,
            such as washing hands, and contaminating food with unsafe water or unclean hands.
        1.2.3.2. Examples of environmental factors not well suited to reasonable interventions
        through the procedures established in this AFI are:
            1.2.3.2.1. Social behaviors such as alcohol and tobacco consumption and diet.
            1.2.3.2.2. The natural environments of vectors that cannot be reasonably modified
            (e.g. in rivers, lakes and wetlands).
            1.2.3.2.3. Natural biological agents, such as pollen in the outdoor environment.
            1.2.3.2.4. Person-to-person transmission that cannot reasonably be prevented through
            environmental interventions such as improving facilities, sanitary hygiene or the
            occupational environment.
1.3. Concepts:
     1.3.1. This Instruction prescribes the use of an AF-approved OEH Management Information
     System (OEH-MIS) to standardize and enhance data entry, management, and reporting. The
     Defense Occupational and Environmental Health Readiness System (DOEHRS) is the DoD
     approved OEH-MIS used to manage and archive OEH exposure data. The AF uses DOEHRS
     to manage longitudinal exposure recordkeeping and reporting.
     1.3.2. This AFI uses a management system approach (as illustrated in Figure 1.1.) to ensure

                                         PLANNING

3.1. Overview. The planning process identifies and prioritizes OEH program issues (hazards,
risks, program deficiencies and opportunities for improvement) to establish objectives, identify
risk reduction opportunities and ensure OEH program improvement.
3.2. Planning.
   3.2.1. HAF.
       3.2.1.1. AF/SG3P establishes/communicates OEH Program priorities to MAJCOM/SG,
       including specific objectives and targets. HAF develops procedures for establishing
       and/or reviewing legal and other requirements, objectives and targets, communications
       and data gathering, assessments, management review and reporting.

   OEH Program objectives/targets as necessary/appropriate.
   3.2.3. Installation. OEH SMEs incorporate HAF priorities, targets and objectives into the
   installation OEH program. Installations may establish installation-specific objectives/targets
   if necessary/appropriate. The Installation Commander, as the ESOHC Chair, reviews and
   approves installation-specific OEH Program priorities, objectives and targets annually.
3.3. OEH Program Policy. AF OEH Program policy articulates senior leadership’s vision for
the OEH Program. AF OEH policy and guidance is prepared, documented and published
through the AF information management process as outlined in AFI 33-360, Publications and
Forms Management. OEH policy and guidance consists of both directive and non-directive
documents issued at all levels of organization and incorporated into the 10-, 32-, 40-, 48-, 90-
and 91-series of publications, reflecting the cross-functional elements of the OEH Program. The
most critical elements of the AF OEH Program are contained in 90-series and 48-series
publications, as illustrated in Figure 3.1. These documents are supported by AFIs, AFMANs,
AFPAMs and other policy instruments as needed to establish and maintain all the key
compliance, risk reduction and continual improvement elements of the OEH Program.
MAJCOM and installation-level supplements to these documents may be published as needed to
address organization-specific aspects.

                                        EXECUTION

4.1. Purpose. Feedback from OEH program execution is used in the planning process to
improve development of future OEH Program objectives and targets.
4.2. Design Review and Change Management. Effective design review and change
management prevents OEH-related injuries\illnesses by identifying hazards and associated risks
before they are introduced into the workplace or community environment.
   4.2.1. BE, with assistance from other Aerospace Medicine functional experts, will
   accomplish OEH design review, including, but not limited to, the following activities: design,
   construction, operation, maintenance and decommissioning.
   4.2.2. Design review includes a prospective Health Risk Assessment (HRA) accomplished
   IAW this AFI and AFMAN 48-153, Health Risk Assessment.
   4.2.3. Design review will account for all federal, state, local and host nation OEH
   requirements and guidance as well as those unique to the DoD and AF (e.g. Whole Building
   Design Guidance (WBDG), Unified Facility Criteria (UFC), Engineering Technical Letters
   (ETLs), etc.).
   4.2.4. The following conditions will necessitate a design review or change management
   process:
       4.2.4.1. New or modified equipment and/or facilities.
       4.2.4.2. New or revised procedures, work practices, design specifications or standards.
       4.2.4.3. Material changes (e.g. industrial chemicals). Hazardous material will be
       managed through the installation Hazardous Material Management Program Team
       (HMMPT) IAW AFI 32-7086.
       4.2.4.4. Significant changes to workplace organizational structure and staffing, including
       the use of contractors. Contract operations may not impact adjacent Air Force employees
       and vice versa. OEH support will not be extended to contractor employees or their
       activities; that is a responsibility of the contractor’s management.
       4.2.4.5. Modification of OEH hazard control measures (e.g. engineering controls and
       Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)).
       4.2.4.6. New or revised OEH standards or regulations.
4.3. OEH Process Assessment.
   4.3.1. Purpose. OEH process assessment enhances overall mission effectiveness by
   protecting AF personnel from OEH hazards/risks. Process assessment provides a framework
   to:
       4.3.1.1. Integrate AF OEH Program objectives with AFMS desired effects and
       capabilities.
 26                                                      AFI48-145_ANGSUP 2 JUNE 2014


      4.3.1.2. Effectively employ the DoD Industrial Hygiene Exposure Assessment Model to
      prioritize assessment efforts on operations/activities posing the greatest OEH risk.
      4.3.1.3. Evaluate the effectiveness of control options designed to minimize OEH-related
      exposure.
      4.3.1.4. Accurately document OEH exposure(s) to ensure an accurate Longitudinal
      Exposure Record (LER) for all AF personnel.
      4.3.1.5. Ensure commanders comply with applicable federal, state or host-nation, and
      local regulations, standards and requirements, as applicable.
   4.3.2. Process Description. The AF implementation of the DoD Industrial Hygiene
   Exposure Assessment Model is illustrated in Figure 4.1. The DoD model consists of eight
   major elements, all of which are incorporated into the AF OEH Exposure Assessment Model.
   Implementation is organized into two basic courses of action: Routine and Special
   Assessment.

Figure 4.1. Air Force OEH Exposure Assessment Model.




   4.3.3. Routine Assessment.
      4.3.3.1. The routine assessment is a qualitative and/or quantitative assessment conducted
      to identify and scope the processes employed/activities encountered when executing the
      unit’s mission. The potential health hazards and associated risks should be scoped to the
      extent that the workplace can be categorized, exposure pathways recognized and
AFI48-145_ANGSUP 2 JUNE 2014                                                                  27


     additional health risk assessment requirements identified. The information collected
     during routine assessment is used to focus limited resources in a prioritized manner.
     Routine assessments are designed to be short-duration, and identify/prioritize the need for
     more in-depth (special) assessment. During routine assessment, BE will identify: new
     workplace processes or environmental exposure pathways; potential OEH risks; data
     required to characterize these risks; additional evaluations needed to obtain required data;
     existing hazard controls; and compliance with OEH Program and regulatory
     requirements. Information obtained from the health risk assessment is then conveyed to
     the appropriate organization for information/action. The principle purpose is to:
         4.3.3.1.1. Identify OEH support requirements;
         4.3.3.1.2. Identify potential OEH hazards related to processes/activities; and
         4.3.3.1.3. Assign a qualitative risk to each hazard. (Use confidence in exposure
         characterization and controls for workplace exposures; use RM for exposure
         pathways due to environmental activities.)
         4.3.3.1.4. Identify any health hazard or exposure that may require a design change or
         modification to an existing weapons system to eliminate/mitigate the hazard.
     4.3.3.2. Compliance assessment activities performed within routine assessment may
     facilitate Environmental, Safety and Occupational Health Compliance Assessment and
     Management Program (ESOHCAMP) completion and credit for OHCAMP requirements
     may be taken if routine assessments meet the requirements of AFI90-803, Environmental,
     Safety and Occupational Health Compliance Assessment and Management Program.
  4.3.4. Special Assessment. A special assessment is typically a quantitative assessment that
  focuses resources on OEH-related hazards that require additional evaluation or classification.
  During this assessment, BE further characterizes health risk through specific additional
  monitoring. The results of additional monitoring are interpreted by comparison with
  applicable health-based exposure standards. Information obtained from the health risk
  assessment is then conveyed to the appropriate organization for information/action. The
  principle purpose is to:
     4.3.4.1. Quantify potential exposures identified during routine assessment;
     4.3.4.2. Perform periodic control evaluations, e.g., ventilation surveys, to maintain
     confidence in the effectiveness of established controls;
     4.3.4.3. Evaluate unscheduled requests, e.g., pregnancy evaluations, OEH illness/injury
     investigations, etc;
     4.3.4.4. Provide follow-up action on recommendations or direction from the OEHWG;
     4.3.4.5. Sustain compliance with regulatory requirements;
     4.3.4.6. Provide commander and affected individuals with a summary of the outcome of
     the assessment, plans for additional evaluations and recommended actions to reduce
     hazard/risk to acceptable levels.

         effectiveness.
         4.3.5.7.3. Establish procedures for BE to identify significant process changes.
  4.3.6. Workplace Categorization & Assessment Frequency. Table 4.1 is a tool for
  categorizing workplaces based on potential OEH risk to workers and determining routine
  assessment frequency. The categorization decision rests with the BE Flight Commander (or
  equivalent), in consultation with the OEHWG. The characteristics listed here, coupled with
  local priorities, should be integrated with RM principles outlined in DoDI 6055.05 to aid in
  decision-making. Note the characteristics listed here are not “all inclusive” and are meant as
  guidelines. BE shall document any locally devised rationale/categorization plan as well as
  categorization (application of the plan) for each workplace using the DOEHRS. Prioritize
  special assessments, periodically review the list of special assessment requirements and
  adjust priority based on risk, or as required by local requirements/conditions. Deployed
  locations will follow surveillance requirements established within their respective areas of
  operation by the Combatant Command Air Component Surgeon.
  4.3.7. OEHSA Exposure Pathway Prioritization and Assessment Frequency. The RM
  process is used to prioritize the potential completed exposure pathways identified in the
  CSM. Any DoD-recognized variations of the hazard probability and severity definitions are
  acceptable in determining the risk rating; the prioritization decision rests with the BE Flight
  Commander (or equivalent), in conjunction with the OEHWG (or equivalent). BE Flight
  Commander (or equivalent) will review the OEHSA within three months of arrival on
  location and annually thereafter.
  4.3.8. See Table 4.1. below. The required routine assessment frequency establishes a
  minimum requirement. A workplace should be visited/assessed as frequently as necessary to
  adequately identify, assess and control specific OEH hazards. The decision to exceed the
  established minimum assessment frequency is made by the base BEE, in consultation with
  the OEHWG

4.4. Occupational and Environmental Health Clinical Surveillance. The objective of OEH
clinical surveillance is to protect AF workers by detecting potential failure in controlling
exposure(s). A secondary objective is to protect AF workers by detecting disease at or before the
point it becomes clinically evident. Historically, bases have developed individual risk
assessment and clinical surveillance guidelines. Emphasis is shifting to focus on a corporately
developed assessment process to allow greater confidence in OEH hazard characterization across
the AF. Medical surveillance data for specific potential exposures will become more uniform as
the capability to broadly assess and analyze OEH-related hazards improves.
   4.4.1. Occupational Medicine. Occupational medicine supports AF mission objectives by
   helping optimize workforce availability and the OEH Program with direct clinical functions
   (tertiary preventive medicine), and illness prevention activities (primary and secondary
   prevention). This is accomplished by:
       4.4.1.1. Identifying worker fitness and limitations for tasks, i.e., New Hire/Special
       Purpose/Fitness for Duty Examinations;
AFI48-145_ANGSUP 2 JUNE 2014                                                                  31


     4.4.1.2. Preventing illness through clinical medical surveillance, i.e., performing MSEs
     and assisting with/consulting on workplace surveillance;
     4.4.1.3. Identifying and supporting prompt treatment of OEH-related injuries and
     illnesses and rehabilitation to minimize disability and impairment. At ANG and AFRC
     installations, provide referral to employee’s primary care physician or Military
     Healthcare System if on Air National Guard/Reserve active duty status or as appropriate.
     For full time Active Guard/Reserve (AGR), Air Reserve Technician (ART) and DoD
     civilian personnel, see Para 2.13.6.
     4.4.1.4. Providing medical consultation and case management for occupationally
     ill/injured civilians and military members. Note: Reserve component Occupational
     Medicine Program is limited in scope, precluding civilian non-occupational assessment
     and treatment (i.e., New Hire/Special Purpose/Fitness for Duty Examinations, etc.).
  4.4.2. Medical Surveillance Examinations. Descriptions and requirements for MSEs are
  presented in the OSHA Standards (29 CFR 1910), DoD 6055.05-M, Occupational Medical
  Surveillance Manual, the US Navy’s Medical Matrix (available from the Navy and Marine
  Corps Public Health Center), and other current and accepted guidance. The general types of
  exams are:
     4.4.2.1. Baseline Examination (Pre-placement).
         4.4.2.1.1. Baseline MSEs are performed before commencement of a specific job to
         assess an employee’s medical condition and biological indicators prior to potential
         exposure to work place hazards. This allows for the identification of potential
         changes that may be due to future work place exposures and enables decision making
         to protect the health of the employee and the other members of the SEG. It also is
         necessary to determine the worker’s ability to meet certification requirements or
         published standard requirements for the job in question (e.g. respirator program
         participation, firefighter certification etc.) Ideally these medical examinations should
         be done before commencement of work. However, if the individual has already
         started work, these examinations will be completed within 60 days of assignment
         unless more stringent requirements exist.
         4.4.2.1.2. Baseline exams should be accomplished prior to job placement for all
         workers permanently or temporarily assigned to the work area for 30 or more days
         per year unless more stringent requirements exist, e.g., respirator users must receive a
         baseline examination regardless of anticipated duration of work.
     4.4.2.2. Periodic Examination. Periodic MSEs are accomplished to identify changes in
     health status and may include medical monitoring to detect evidence of unacceptable
     exposure including biological changes indicative of an OEH-related illness or injury.
     4.4.2.3. Termination of Exposure. An MSE is accomplished upon termination of
     exposure such as a Permanent Change of Station or transfer to another workplace; if the
     person is continuing in the same job at the next assignment, a termination examination
     may not be necessary. Normally, the examination requirements will be the same as for
     the periodic examination. Generally, if a periodic MSE was accomplished within the last
     180 working days, a termination of exposure MSE will not be required unless more
     stringent requirements exist, e.g., asbestos workers must have termination exam within +
32                                                       AFI48-145_ANGSUP 2 JUNE 2014


     30 days of termination. Not all exposures require termination exams. Proper
     documentation of a termination exam is important in preventing future compensation
     costs. Termination of exposure exams are used for hazards with predominately acute
     effects.
     4.4.2.4. Termination of Employment. Per some OSHA expanded standards or AF
     polices, a termination of employment exam is required when the employee worked in a
     job after leaving a SEG and then retires or separates from the AF.
  4.4.3. MSE Requirements.
     4.4.3.1. The OEHWG reviews the OEHED provided by BE. The OEHED summarizes
     the type of work performed, the workers’ overall OEH exposure, and required controls.
     4.4.3.2. OEHWG will identify regulatory and additional MSE requirements, e.g.
     requirements in union agreements and/or local contracts.
     4.4.3.3. The OEHWG will document and track MSE requirements for all workplaces.
  4.4.4. MSE Scheduling, Reporting and Follow-up.
     4.4.4.1. PH will work with the supporting clinic, supervisors, designated unit
     representatives or individual employees to schedule appointments.
     4.4.4.2. PH will coordinate with supervisors to maximize completion rates and to
     minimize impact on mission where possible.
     4.4.4.3. PH will validate personnel assignments in PIMR.
     4.4.4.4. PH will track completion and maintain records of show/cancellation rates for
     clinical surveillance. Air Force Air Reserve Components’ installations MSE scheduling,
     reporting, and follow-up is accomplished by the Reserve Medical Unit.
     4.4.4.5. FM will help HCPs communicate results of the MSE to the worker within
     timeframes established by AF and/or regulatory requirements.
     4.4.4.6. FM will schedule any required follow-ups and monitor until completion.
     4.4.4.7. FM will ensure completion and documentation of all MSE results in the
     respective member’s medical record
  4.4.5. Data Standardization. OEH surveillance programs will be standardized across the Air
  Force as follows:
     4.4.5.1. FM will review the OEHED and MSE requirements prior to each MSE. The
     requirements must be those approved by the IOEMC.
     4.4.5.2. If the OEHED and MSE requirements (COHER) located in the employee’s
     electronic medical record are not current the most current available versions at the time of
     examination of personnel assigned to category 1 and 2 workplaces, the office completing
     the examination (FM, Occupational Medicine Services, or PH) will locate and file the
     current information in the hard copy medical record (or upload and attach to the
     electronic medical record if resources allow).
  4.4.6. OEH Illness Program Management.
AFI48-145_ANGSUP 2 JUNE 2014                                                                 33


      4.4.6.1. Supervisors, military personnel and DoD civilian employees are responsible for
      minimizing OEH-related risks and reporting illnesses and injuries.
      4.4.6.2. All medical personnel who examine (or see) patients should be aware of
      illnesses that have a correlation to OEH exposures. DoD 6055.05-M has a list of sentinel
      events related to workplace exposure.
      4.4.6.3. Workers and other beneficiaries suspected of having OEH-related illnesses will
      be referred to PH. PH will document and track suspected OEH-related illnesses; Ground
      Safety will document and track suspected occupational injuries.
      4.4.6.4. PH will use AFSAS to record, report, and trend OEH illness data.
          4.4.6.4.1. PH will validate demographic (including component status) and specific
          case information to ensure each record is accurate and as complete as possible.
      4.4.6.5. BE, PH and the HCP work cooperatively to complete the OEH illness
      investigation process.
          4.4.6.5.1. PH performs the patient and workplace supervisor interviews. The HCP
          may engage if needed.
          4.4.6.5.2. BE accomplishes the OEH investigation and documents findings in
          AFSAS.
      4.4.6.6. The IOEMC makes the final determination on the work-relatedness for a
      suspected OEH-related illness after review of the information provided by BE and PH.
      4.4.6.7. The IOEMC will document the decision in the patient’s medical records and in
      AFSAS.
      4.4.6.8. PH will forward occupational illness information to the OSHA 300 log via
      AFSAS (illness reports which are closed as “occupationally-related” illnesses are
      automatically included on the OSHA 300 log).
4.5. Education and Training.
   4.5.1. Unit/organizational commanders will ensure general OEH awareness training is
   provided to all personnel (military and civilian). BE routine and special assessment reports,
   as well as workplace-specific Hazard Communication (HAZCOM) training provided IAW
   AFI 90-821, Hazard Communication, will be used to meet this requirement for workplaces
   where OEH risk assessments are required.
   4.5.2. Unit/organizational commanders will establish a procedure, with assistance from the
   installation OEH staff, to make personnel aware of:
      4.5.2.1. OEH policy and procedures (i.e. plans, instructions, checklists, etc.).
      4.5.2.2. Significant OEH aspects, regulatory compliance issues and actual/potential
      impacts associated with work accomplished under their authority, and mission related
      benefits of improved OEH Program performance.
      4.5.2.3. Responsibilities associated with eliminating/reducing OEH risk and maintaining
      regulatory compliance.
 34                                                      AFI48-145_ANGSUP 2 JUNE 2014


       4.5.2.4. Potential negative outcomes related to departure from specified plans,
       procedures, checklists, etc.
   4.5.3. Forums such as commander’s call and staff meetings, as well as products such as unit
   policy memorandums and newsletters are acceptable methods for delivering general OEH
   awareness education and training.
   4.5.4. OEH Program training will be documented on AF Form 55, Employee Safety and
   Health Record, in the Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS) or in other AF-approved
   systems that track/verify training is accomplished.
4.6. Emergency Preparedness. Installations will plan for and develop procedures to prevent
and/or respond to foreseeable emergencies, natural and man-made, applicable to their workplace
operations in accordance with AFI 10-2501.
4.7. Documentation. Personnel must have access to the most current documents and records.
Document control and records management are critical elements of an efficient management
system. Installations shall follow AFMAN 33-363 to establish and maintain an effective OEH
records management program. Those responsible for managing OEH documents and records will
maintain strict compliance with the requirements of 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1904,
Recording and Reporting Occupational Injuries and Illness and 29 CFR 1910.1020, Access to
Employee Exposure and Medical Records. Personnel will be briefed and provided access to their
personal exposure records and workplace evaluations by their supervisor and copies of records
will be provided upon request.

                          MEASUREMENT AND ASSESSMENT

5.1. Performance Measurement. An effective monitoring/assessment program can identify
significant deviations from “steady-state” OEH program performance. This may provide early
indications the OEH Program is not performing at optimum effectiveness/efficiency.
   5.1.1. Measure of Effectiveness (MOE). A MOE is also known as a “lagging” or
   “coincident” indicator, a.k.a., outcomes or outcome measures. MOEs can be developed to
   measure effectiveness in achieving objectives and targets across the entire enterprise or be
   tailored to measure the effectiveness of a single process or project. Examples of OEH
   Program MOEs include: reducing unacceptable exposure events; occupational injury and
   illness rates; time needed to implement corrective action; number of regulatory non-
   compliance events; lost duty/work time; and worker compensation costs.
   5.1.2. Measure of Performance (MOP). A MOP is also known as a “leading” indicator,
   a.k.a., input or input measure. MOPs are designed to measure how well essential activities
   designed to maintain program effectiveness are being performed. Like MOEs, MOPs can be
   developed to measure performance across a large enterprise or tailored to the requirements of
   a specific project or process. Examples of OEH Program MOPs include: accomplishing
   scheduled assessments; MSE completion rate; resource availability; education and training
   completion; and implementing/sustaining OEH controls.
   5.1.3. Figure 5 1 provides a notional illustration of the use of MOPs and MOEs to evaluate
   OEH Program effectiveness. Each MOP and MOE will have an assigned objective, target
   and established thresholds to determine when the measurement reaches an undesirable level.
   In this example, how well the major process steps (MOPs) achieve assigned objectives and
   targets will directly impact the desired outcomes (MOEs).
   5.1.4. Installations shall track operational performance using established/accepted HAF and
   MAJCOM OEH performance measures. Installations may also develop/adopt performance
   measures designed to achieve installation-unique objectives and targets.

5.2. OEH Program Evaluation.
   5.2.1. Internal Assessment. Internal assessments are conducted locally by workplaces and
   organizations with key roles in planning and executing the OEH Program. Data/information
   collected through the following activities is considered a valid OEH Program internal
   assessment:
      5.2.1.1. Tier 1 and 2 OHCAMP activities performed IAW AFI 90-803.
      5.2.1.2. OEH Program-specific assessments performed by BE, PH and FM IAW AFI 44-
      119, Medical Quality Operations.
      5.2.1.3. Any other internal assessment accomplished locally to specifically evaluate
      OEH Program effectiveness.
   5.2.2. External Assessment. External assessments are performed by personnel not assigned
   to the organization being assessed. They are designed to assess the overall effectiveness of
   the OEH Program. Data/information collected through the following activities is considered a
   valid OEH Program external assessment:
      5.2.2.1. Tier 3 OHCAMP activities as performed IAW AFI 90-803.
      5.2.2.2. Air Force Inspection Agency (AFIA) inspections and evaluations of any
      elements of the OEH Program.
AFI48-145_ANGSUP 2 JUNE 2014                                                                       37


       5.2.2.3. Air Force Audit Agency audits designed to assess any component(s) of the OEH
       Program across the AF or at MAJCOM- or installation-level.
       5.2.2.4. OEH inspection visits by federal, state, local and overseas regulatory agencies.
       5.2.2.5. Staff Assist Visits (SAVs).
5.3. Corrective and Preventive Actions.
   5.3.1. Hazard Abatement. The risk-based hazard abatement process described in DoDI
   6055.1 will be followed to ensure that hazards posing a higher risk of injury or illness will be
   given a higher priority for control and/or elimination.
       5.3.1.1. Expedited corrective measures will be taken in situations where identified health
       hazards could be expected to cause fatality, serious injury or illness in the near term if left
       uncorrected.
       5.3.1.2. Interim corrective actions must be taken when corrective and preventive actions
       for an identified health hazard will require a significant period of time to implement.
       These health hazards will be placed into the formal installation hazard abatement plan.
5.4. Feedback to the Planning Process. The results of monitoring, measurement and
assessment activities, including audits, incident investigations and corrective and preventive
actions, will be addressed in the planning process and the management review.

                                 MANAGEMENT REVIEW

6.1. Purpose. The Program Management Review (PMR) allows for leadership at HAF,
MAJCOM and installation-level, along with OEH Program leaders and process owners, to
critically evaluate OEH Program performance and implement improvements. HAF, MAJCOM
and installation ESOHCs shall conduct an OEH PMR at least annually. Semi-annual ESOHC
meets the requirements for the PMR.
6.2. Management Review Inputs. At all levels, the PMR will consider:
   6.2.1. Progress in risk reduction
   6.2.2. Effectiveness of OEH process assessment
   6.2.3. Effectiveness in identifying and correcting root causes of OEH Program deficiencies
   6.2.4. Status of corrective and preventive actions
   6.2.5. Changing circumstances, including developments in legal and other requirements
   related to OEH aspects
   6.2.6. Follow-up actions from OEH Program internal assessments, external assessments and
   previous management reviews
   6.2.7. The extent to which objectives and targets have been met
   6.2.8. Recommendations for improvement
6.3. Outcome and Follow-Up. Senior leadership at all levels will provide appropriate direction
for correcting noted deficiencies, including the need for investment, policy revision and
adjustments to objectives and targets. Performance measures will be reviewed during the
ESOHC for appropriateness and relevance, and adjusted as necessary to drive performance
toward established OEH Program objectives and targets. The review must be documented.
ESOHC minutes meet the requirement for documenting the PMR.

Guard and Air Force Reserve personnel on active duty or in drill status; US Air Force Academy
AFI48-145_ANGSUP 2 JUNE 2014                                                                   43


cadets; Reserve Officers’ Training Corps cadets when engaged in directed training processes;
and foreign national military personnel assigned to the US Air Force.
Air Force Worker—Collective group comprised of Air Force Military and Civilian personnel.
Aspects—OEH aspects are features or characteristics of an activity, product or service that affect
or can affect occupational and environmental health.
Clinical Surveillance—The process by which workers receive Occupational & Environmental
Health Medical Examinations, which are designed and conducted, based on an assessment of
workers’ identified OEH risks. The results of these examinations are analyzed to determine if Air
Force operations are adversely affecting the health of the workers. Clinical surveillance is also
required in specific instances to meet OSHA requirements for medical monitoring. Additionally,
clinical surveillance can be used to assess the adequacy of protective measures.
Confidence in Controls—A qualitative and/or quantitative determination of how well and how
consistently an OEH hazard is being controlled.
Confidence in Hazard Characterization—A qualitative and/or quantitative determination of
the adequacy of OEH hazard data for reaching sound conclusions regarding exposure.
Geographically Separated Unit (GSU)—A unit that is not at the same physical location or
installation as the parent unit.
Health Risk Assessment (HRA)—A HRA is the process of identifying, evaluating actual or
potential health risks, and developing options for controlling environmental and occupational
health (OEH) threats in specific populations or locations over time. (See AFMAN 48-153,
Health Risk Assessment, 28 Mar 2007 for additional information).
Limited Scope Medical Treatment Facility (LSMTF)—LSMTFs are medical elements,
flights, or small medical squadrons with a credentialed medical provider that do not provide the
scope of services found in a medical group. LSMTFs are typically assigned to a line squadron or
group (e.g. Air Base Squadron, Mission Support Group or Air Base Group). In some cases, a
LSMTF may report directly to a wing or MAJCOM.
Longitudinal Exposure Record (LER)—A comprehensive record of all occupational and
environmental exposures for a full working lifetime; applies to all DoD personnel.
Measure of Effectiveness (MOE)—An observable outcome-based measure closely related to
established strategic objectives and targets being evaluated. MOEs are also known as “lagging”
or “coincident” indicators because changes are the result of changes in a number of leading
indicators.
Measure of Performance (MOP)—An observable indicator used to assess progress towards
achievement of established objectives and targets. MOPs are also known as “leading” indicators
because they are usually measured at the process level and are designed to allow for pre-emptive
actions to improve the chances of achieving established objectives and targets.
Medical Aid Station (MAS)—A small medical element without a credentialed medical provider
and typically located at a GSU or MUNSS site.
Munitions Support Squadron (MUNSS)—A geographically separated unit responsible for
receipt, storage, maintenance and control of United States War Reserve Munitions in support of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and its strike missions. See AFI 21-200.

Objectives—Objectives are derived from program goals and are well-defined, specific and
quantifiable statements of the desired results of the program.
Occupational and Environmental Health Site Assessment (OEHSA)—The OEHSA is the
key operational health tool for producing data or information used for health risk assessments
(HRA) and to satisfy OEH surveillance requirements. OEHSAs focus on collecting site-specific
data to identify potential or actual exposure pathways during bed down, employ, and sustainment
of air and space forces. (See AFMAN 48-154, Occupational and Environmental Health Site
Assessment, 28 Mar 2007 for additional information)
OEH-Related Illness or Injury—A suspected or confirmed adverse health event caused or
aggravated by employment as described in Occupational Injury and Illness Reporting Guidelines
for Federal Agencies (OMB 1200-0029). OEH-related illness or injury also includes biological
changes indicative of overexposure to a hazard.
Population at Risk—The population or a subset of the population that is at risk of experiencing
an event or being exposed to a health threat during a specified period and at a specified location.
Process—Any item of work or situation that may pose a risk and may require evaluation and
control; the lowest level of work that may require evaluation to assess exposure and associated
controls. Not all processes are associated with a physical location, e.g., working near the flight
line may constitute a process. The terms Activity and Process are synonymous.
Routine Assessment—A qualitative and/or quantitative assessment that identifies health hazards
and associated risks to focus limited resources in a prioritized manner.
Special Assessment—Typically a quantitative assessment that focuses resources on OEH-
related hazards that require additional evaluation or classification based on information gained
during routine assessment.
Targets—The specific target values for performance measures designed to measure progress
towards established objectives, e.g. reduce occupational illness by 2% over previous FY.
Unit Health Monitor—An individual appointed by the Unit Commander to ensure that medical
surveillance exams are scheduled and completed by individuals in their organization in a timely
manner, and communicates the status of medical exams completion to the Commander,
supervisors in the organization and to Public Health.
Workplace—Any environment where a potential OEH exposure may occur. A workplace may
be administrative, industrial, or all encompassing, e.g., any setting where an OEH exposure may
occur while deployed.
