        of recycled content materials, locally produced materials or rapidly renewable
        materials to reduce environmental impact are common practice. Materials with
        extended life cycles to reduce wear and the need for frequent replacement are
        commonly utilized. Janitorial services are in accordance with the care instructions
        provided by product manufacturers.            Installation has developed a Green
        Housekeeping (cleaning and maintenance program using nontoxic, low-VOC
        cleaning products) policy for the installation to improve indoor air quality, reduce
        waste and reduce pollutants. Public spaces and work areas are well organized and
        make the best use of available space. All areas are clean, well maintained and clear
        of extraneous material. Finishes, furnishings and accessories comply with the
        Facilities Excellence Plan and present a harmonious and professional environment.
        Safety devices are integrated into the overall design of the work environment.
        Signage, bulletin boards and directories comply with Air Force Sign Standards, are
        neatly arranged and current. Recycling containers are conveniently located and
        integrated into the design of the workspace.

        coordinated and are appropriate in color and style to present a harmonious and
        professional environment. Materials are well maintained and are clean. Materials
        and furnishings are functional and appropriate for the space. Lighting is of an
        appropriate type and style for the function of the space. Color rendition and
