  This supplement implements and extends the guidance of AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing
  Zone Operations, 10 May 2007. This supplement describes procedures for use in conjunction
  with the basic AFI. This supplement establishes Drop Zone and Landing Zone Procedures for
  AFGSC UH-1N flying activities. This publication applies to all AFGSC units with UH-1N
  assets. This supplement does not apply to Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve Command
  Units.
  Ensure that all records created as a result of the processes prescribed in this publication are
  maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records,
  and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Information Management System
  (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-

  through standardization and evaluation channels, to Headquarters Air Force Global Strike
  Command, (HQ AFGSC/A3T), 841 Fairchild Ave, Suite 223, Barksdale AFB, LA 71110.
  SUMMARY OF CHANGES
  This supplement is new, but identical to the AFSPC supplement except it has been changed to
  reflect the move of UH-1Ns from AFSPC to AFGSC.
  1.3. Deviations and waivers. Waiver authority for this AFI and supplement is delegated to
  AFGSC/A3T. The Air Component Commander (ACC) for AFGSC is the Operations Group
  Commander (OG/CC). Exception: when assigned under a mission commander (MC) as outlined
2                                                AFI 13-217_AFGSCSUP 1 JANUARY 2010

in AFI 11-2UH-1N Vol 3, UH-1N Helicopter Operations Procedures, the MC will designate the
ACC.
3.15. General. Approved operational sites are not considered HLZs and not governed by this
publication. Follow AFI11-2UH-1NV3 guidance for operational sites.
3.16. Helicopter Landing Zone Selection. Selecting the HLZ location is also the responsibility
of the HS/CC.
3.18. Helicopter Landing Zone Survey Requirements. All references and responsibilities
assigned to group tactics will be conducted by the HS/DO or designee. Exception: for HHQ
conducted training or exercises all references and responsibilities assigned to group tactics will
be conducted by 20 AF/A3H or designee.
3.18.1.1. Host nation (HN) HLZ Surveys. The physical inspection of the HLZ may be
accomplished utilizing an airborne asset. In this instance the crew will perform a full remote
reconnaissance. The initial approach will be conducted to a hover to visually inspect the area
below the helicopter prior to landing. When conducting HLZ surveys, Alternate
Insertion/Extraction (AIE) considerations will be included on the AF IMT 4303, Helicopter
Landing Zone Survey.
3.18.1.2. Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS) generated maps are authorized for AFGSC.
3.18.3. Tactical HLZ Surveys. The tactical HLZ survey process is an expedited survey process to
meet specific commander’s objectives. It does not denote the particular flight profile of the
aircrew. Aircrews may or may not be flying tactically and may or may not perform a full
unprepared landing area high/low reconnaissance depending on the situation.
3.18.3.2. The ACC may grant blanket authorization to use the tactical HLZ survey process for
group level and higher exercises and HHQ training or exercises. If the ACC changes, a new
blanket authorization must be obtained.
3.18.3.2.1. (Added) This authorization may be for defined geographic boundaries (i.e. all group
level or higher exercises conducted within the missile complex, or HHQ training or exercises in
the Camp Guernsey range complex) or grant a specific time frame authorization, usually
associated with a specific exercise (i.e. during Road Warrior).
3.18.3.2.2. (Added) These areas may only be designated after a thorough survey and any
exclusions are documented. Prior to conducting operations in the designated area, the applicable
information from the survey will be made available to the aircrew(s) for mission planning.
3.18.3.2.3. (Added) Multiple possible landing areas within the boundaries may be utilized at the
discretion of the aircraft commander.
3.19.1. Missile Alert Facilities (MAFs) (including the access road and helipad), and Launch
Facilities (LFs) (including the area within the fenced boundary and access road) are considered
operational sites. LFs will be treated as an unprepared landing area for evaluation of the landing
site. Follow AFI11-2UH-1NV3 guidance for high/low reconnaissance procedures.
3.19.2. The primary reviewer is the HS/DO or 20 AF/A3H as appropriate.
3.19.4. The HS/DO or 20 AF/A3H (as appropriate) will determine where HLZ surveys are
maintained. Surveys will be accessible to aircrews for use in pre-mission planning.

1NV3 guidance.
