                                             Chapter 1

                                     GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.1. Purpose. The purpose of this instruction is to provide a single source document to support
the planning and execution of the 482d Fighter Wing-Wings Over Homestead Air Show
(referred hereafter as the ―open houses‖) at 482 FW. It is written to help the planning staff find
relevant regulations and interpretations from numerous organizations and functions. It
incorporates and supersedes policy memoranda from United States Air Force Vice Commander
(USAF/CV), Gen Carns, of July 1994 and from USAF/CV, Gen Moorman, of March 1996.
1.2. Goal. The 482 FW hosts open houses to ensure the public is informed of 482 FW
preparedness, to demonstrate modern weapon systems and capabilities, to promote good
community and international relations, to support 482 FW recruiting and retention efforts and to
showcase our Airmen. Opening 482 FW bases to the public provides opportunities for education
and satisfies interest in the military and its role in national security affairs. The term "open
house" identifies a traditional activity held on military installations. The terms ―open house‖ and
―air show‖ have been used interchangeably in the past, but ―open house‖ is a better term for the
spectrum of events in the 482 FW. The use of this term is not intended to specify or dictate any
predetermined level of access to military installations. Inviting the general public onto the
installation for an open house does not, in and of itself, cause the installation to lose its status as
"closed" for the purposes of controlling political or ideological speech.
1.3. Orientation. An Air Force open house is a community relations activity, which should
generally highlight the mission and resources of the host base. However, military equipment and
people from other bases and services may be invited to demonstrate additional capabilities. The
primary purpose of open houses is to educate the public, not to raise funds for Morale, Welfare,
and Recreation (MWR) or other base organizations. That does not prevent MWR involvement
or a unit bake sale type activity as long as fund-raising does not become the primary objective of
the event.
   1.3.1. Open houses should not take on the overall character of a carnival or fund-raising
   event. This is not a benchmark against which each performer or vendor should be measured.
   Civilian aircraft paint schemes and logos should not be considered as part of the ―carnival-
   like‖ atmosphere decision, but can be considered signage.
   1.3.2. Open houses are opportunities to feature Air Force people and capabilities. Soliciting
   commercial sponsorship to help fund MWR portions of the open house, including funding for
   a family area or ―kid zone‖, is an acceptable practice. Mechanical rides intended for adults
   such as large roller coasters and Ferris wheels, along with midway-type games of chance or
   skill, are prohibited. ―Kid zone‖ activities should be intended for solely for the use of
   children and could include attractions such as jumping castles and small mechanical rides
   like carousels and small trains.
   1.3.3. Open houses should be no more than three days in length. A typical format is a two-
   day show in addition to at least one practice day (or two with a military jet team).
1.4. Commander Responsibilities. The installation commander is responsible for ensuring the
open house maintains a military orientation. The commander must execute each open house
8                                                            482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009


with prudent oversight that balances the issues of force protection and operations tempo with the
expected benefits of opening the base to the public. To highlight the base mission and Air Force
life, the commander may consider opening dining facilities, dormitories, maintenance shops,
classrooms, flight simulators and other unclassified facilities for public view. The commanders
should ensure an open house is properly funded before committing to the event. An open house
is not only an event open to the general public, but could also be a day during which the
commander may host members of one or more community groups. Consideration should be
given to inviting business leaders, educators, food service workers, medical professionals,
housing authorities or students to the base for orientation geared to that group.
1.5. Warbirds. Vintage military aircraft, also known as ―Warbirds‖, operated by individuals or
not-for-profit organizations that primarily relate to military history are not considered civilian
demonstrations. A warbird is defined as any vintage military aircraft that is a likeness of or has
been used in a military conflict or which had historical military aviation significance. The
warbird could be a U.S. military aircraft or that of a foreign government. The narration during
the show must clearly include how the aircraft is militarily significant. This is especially
important for civilian aircraft not painted in a clearly military fashion.
1.6. Civilian Aerial Demonstrations. Civilian aerial acts are permitted if they enhance or
supplement the military activities. Civilian demonstrations may contribute to overall event
attractiveness, which affords greater military recruiting exposure and stimulates interest in
national defense. In keeping with the spirit and purpose of military open houses, military aircraft
must perform the majority of demonstration flying time. Previous guidance limiting civilian
participation to 33 percent of the total demonstration time has been superseded. The proportion
of military to civilian acts is at the commander‘s discretion. Air races by either fixed wing,
rotary wing aircraft or hot air balloons are prohibited. The benefit of barnstorming acts such as
wing-walkers to the event should be weighed by the commander and staff against their
contribution to a carnival-like atmosphere.
1.7. Safety. Safety is the prime consideration at all times. Do not execute aerial performances
that endanger the safety of spectators or participants, or that threaten damage to property.
Official military demonstrations will use criteria provided in their own approved AF or Major
Command (MAJCOM) instructions, and are subject to DoD and Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) regulations.
1.8. Showmanship and Professionalism. Aerial performances have many objectives, which
include entertaining and educating the general public and military community on Air Force
capabilities. In developing and performing aerial events, supervisors and participants should
remember the objective is to demonstrate Air Force professionalism and competence to the
general public. Strict compliance with show lines, procedures, and minimum altitude restrictions
reflects both professionalism and good showmanship by providing spectators, including those in
the rear of the spectator area, an unobstructed view of the aerial performance.
1.9. Fees. The 482 FW will not charge for admission, parking, or the viewing of any activities.
    1.9.1. The 482 FW may provide special seating for distinguished visitors at no charge, but
    will use caution that these arrangements do not significantly obstruct general spectator
    viewing. Additionally, arrangements for handicapped spectators are required under the
    Americans with Disabilities Act.
482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009                                                                       9


   1.9.2. Specifically prohibited are charges for admission to military aircraft or other
   equipment. Photos of attendees donning military clothing or seated in military aircraft or
   equipment may not be offered for sale. Owners and/or operators of aircraft not owned by the
   Federal Government, such as vintage (warbird) aircraft, will not be permitted to impose a
   mandatory admission charge to view or enter their aircraft. Donations for tours of the non-
   government aircraft or to the private sponsoring organization may be requested to provide for
   the maintenance and upkeep of the aircraft.
   1.9.3. The 482 FW will provide free water from potable water sources. In addition, 482 FW
   will provide free portable restroom facilities (e.g. Port-o-John‘s).
   1.9.4. Force protection concerns will dictate the appropriate parking and transportation plan
   for the air show. The plan will be developed by security forces and approved by the wing
   commander.
1.10. Chalets/ Distinguish Visitor (DV) Hospitality Tents. Establishment of a commander
hosted, single DV chalet or tent, offset from the center of the show area, with no sponsorship
signage, is permissible. Tickets for admission to this area can be given to sponsors based on a
percentage of total support. No charges will be imposed for admission to the commander‘s tent.
   1.10.1. Services may create tent/chalets for the use of commercial sponsors. Staffs should
   weigh the benefit of increased sponsorship revenues versus the perceptions of the general
   public when determining the number of private tents to be permitted. These tents will be
   physically separated from the commander‘s tent and will not obstruct the public‘s viewing of
   the event. Admission to these tents will not be sold, but may be part of a support package to
   a sponsor.
   1.10.2. Base leadership may visit the sponsor tents and may invite the sponsors to visit the
   commander‘s tent.
   1.10.3. If the staff elects to admit some performers to the commander‘s DV tent, then all
   performers will be admitted to the tent.
1.11. Private Organizations (PO) and Non-Federal Organizations (NFO).
   1.11.1. POs are governed by AFI 34-223, Private Organizations (PO) Program. POs are
   base chartered, self-sustaining special interest groups, set up by people acting exclusively
   outside the scope of any official capacity as officers, employees, or agents of the Federal
   Government. POs are not Federal entities and are not to be treated as such. They operate on
   Air Force installations with the written consent of the installation commander. While POs
   are normally required to carry insurance coverage, such coverage would not protect against
   claims generated by a serious accident, leaving PO members personally liable to civil
   lawsuits. For this reason, POs should not be used to contract for aerial acts or other activities
   that could expose the members to personal liability.
   1.11.2. NFO operate outside Services' Private Organization Program. Examples of such
   NFOs include professional military organizations (such as the Air Force Association), local
   chambers of commerce, commercial entities, or organizations of community or business
   leaders formed for the specific purpose of promoting an open house.
       1.11.2.1. The 482 FW will use the Reserve Officers Association (ROA), local chapter 22
       as the promoting and financial NFO.
10                                                            482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009


     1.11.3. Both of these organizations can have a role in organizing and funding an open house,
     however the installation commander and his staff will retain overall control of the event.
     Care must be taken to avoid giving the public the perception the PO or NFO is hosting the
     overall event, or any portion of it. Websites and other publicly disseminated media must
     clearly convey to the public the fact the PO or NFO is assisting the installation with the open
     house. For further information on incorporating these organizations into an open house,
     reference AFI 34-223, and consult Air Combat Command/Judge Advocate (ACC/JA), which
     has particular expertise in the matter.

     3.1.15. Other functions that might be useful on an open house staff include protocol,
     maintenance, transportation/logistics and a chaplain.
3.2. Timeline. Attempt to solidify the date for the open house as early as possible to help
establish a timeline for the planning process. Nine to fifteen months is a normal planning cycle
for an open house. A key deadline is 1 July of the preceding year for requests for military
demonstration teams (e.g. USAF Thunderbirds). Make this request using DD Form 2535. The
instructions for this form are available at http://www.airshows.pa.hq.af.mil. More information
can be found in chapter 11, Public Affairs. Another important date is the International Council
of Air Shows (ICAS) Inc., convention. It is normally held in December and allows face-to-face
interaction with the performers. The OHD and staff should consider attending this convention to
book the acts. As a minimum, the air operations, Public Affairs, finance, services, and
contracting coordinators should attend. More information about ICAS is available at their
website, http://www.airshows.aero/. A suggested planning guide, broken down by task, can be
found in Attachment 3. Note: Reference to ICAS or their products does not imply an
endorsement by the Air Force. Any interaction with this organization is optional.
3.3. Training. The air show industry changes year by year, and the best place to obtain the
latest and greatest information is by attending the ICAS Convention which typically occurs the
first week of December. The OHD, Air Operations Officer, and Marketing Director at a
minimum should attend this conference. If a 482 FW member will serve as the Air Boss, it is
highly suggested he or she attends the Air Boss instructional seminars.

                                            Chapter 4

                                         OPERATIONS

4.1. Restrictions. This instruction intends to provide latitude to conduct open house air
operations within the current boundaries of Air Force guidance. Individual performers might
have more restrictive operating limitations. It is imperative to match weather and altitude
operating limits with the performers and the airfield environment.
4.2. Execution of Flying Operational Plans. Wings Over Homestead‘s type of flying
operations at a military airfield requires the highest coordination and cooperation between
Miami-Dade County, FAA, Homestead Air Traffic Control, and tenants on Homestead Air
Reserve Base (HARB). The Air Operations Officer will make every effort to maintain the
highest quality of community relations between the above mentioned groups with the 482 FW.
     4.2.1. Deliberate Planning. The Air Boss will coordinate with the local authorities to set up
     a tentative flying plan that will not interfere with local commercial and private flying.
     4.2.2. Execution of Flying Operations.      The Operations Officer will ensure all of the
     following requirements are met:
        4.2.2.1. Advanced Information. The Operations Officers will ensure performers have
        electronic access to safety and operational information before departing their home
        station. This is not to replace the Air Boss briefing, but to enhance situational awareness
        and facilitate practice day briefings.
        4.2.2.2. Air Boss Briefing. The Air Boss will brief all performing crewmembers prior to
        flying. The formal Air Boss briefing will be prior to flying on show days.
        4.2.2.3. Alternate Air Boss Briefing. If a performer cannot attend the formal Air Boss
        briefing for extenuating circumstances, at the discretion of the Air Operations Officer, the
        Air Boss may brief the performers individually. It is the Air Operations Officer‘s
        responsibility to ensure this alternate style of briefing will not be abused by performers.
        4.2.2.4. Practice Days. Due to the nature of arriving on practice days, the Air Boss may
        brief performers on an individual basis.
4.3. Altitude Minimums. The minimum altitudes published in AFI 11-202, Volume 3, General
Flight Rules, and in FAA regulations apply. The FAA may grant a certificate of waiver for an
open house authorizing an altitude lower than normally authorized. In no cases will Air Force
pilots operate at an altitude lower than USAF minimum altitudes.
4.4. USAF Minimum Altitudes. In certain cases, such as for military or civilian demonstration
team performances, the FAA may specifically waive the altitude requirements above. Even if
the FAA authorizes a lower altitude, USAF fixed wing aircraft must not be flown lower than the
following minimum altitudes:
     4.4.1. 500 feet Above Ground level (AGL) for a formation.
     4.4.2. 250 feet AGL for a single aircraft. Note: Air Force demonstration teams may be
     authorized lower altitudes in accordance with (IAW) the AFI 11-246 Volume 1, Air Force
     Aircraft Demonstrations (A-10, F-15, F-16, & F-16), AFI 11-246 Volume 3, Air Force
482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009                                                                          17


   Aircraft Demonstrations (F-22, & CV-22), AFI 11-246 Volume 5, Air Force Aircraft
   Demonstrations (MC-130E/H/P & MH-53J/M), AFI 11-246 Volume 6, Air Force Aircraft
   Demonstrations (C-17, C-130, C-141,C/KC/NKC-135, UH-1) and AFI 11-246 Volume 7, Air
   Force Aircraft Demonstrations (Sailplanes).
4.5. Rotary Wing Altitudes. MAJCOMs are authorized to establish altitudes lower than the
minimums specified in paragraphs 4.4.1 and 4.4.2 for operating command rotary wing aircraft in
the execution of approved aircraft demonstration profiles when the lower altitudes are necessary
to properly demonstrate capabilities. Each MAJCOM sets minimum altitudes for the safe
operation of their assets. The approved aircraft demonstration profiles must conform to the
guidance in the AFI 11-246 Volumes 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7.
4.6. Airspeed Limitations. The minimum airspeed for the operation of any fixed-wing AF
aircraft participating in any military or civilian event is stall speed plus 30 percent for the aircraft
configuration. Airlift aircraft used in demonstrating standard, approved tactical procedures such
as assault takeoffs or assault landings, may be flown at lower airspeeds, but not at airspeeds
lower than specified in technical order publications. Maximum airspeed is limited to .90 MACH
for all aerial demonstrations except for approved record flights. Note: Demonstration teams will
comply with airspeed limitations in the AFI 11-246 Volumes 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7 and/or MAJCOM
instructions.
4.7. Weather Minimums. The minimum ceiling and visibility for Air Force events is
determined by the local FAA Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) with consideration to the
performance conducted. The Air Operations Officer may set higher minimums based on the
nature of the event, local terrain, or other factors. The AFI 11-246 AFI 11-246 Volumes 1, 2, 3,
5, 6, and 7 contains weather minimums for single-ship military demonstration team profiles.
   4.7.1. Flight demonstrations should not be conducted unless the ceiling is at least 1,500 feet,
   and the visibility is at least 3 statute miles at the time of the demonstration. However, the Air
   Operations Officer, after coordinating with the FAA Investigator-In-Charge (IIC) and the Air
   Boss, may adjust the minimum ceiling and visibility requirements at his or her discretion.
   4.7.2. Both the U.S. Navy Blue Angels and the Canadian Force Snowbirds have ―flat‖ shows
   that require 1,000 feet and 3 miles of visibility.
4.8. Inspector-in-Charge (IIC). The FAA IIC is the Aviation Safety Inspector (ASI) who
conducts the feasibility study, participates in the preseason evaluation meeting, evaluates the
application for waiver or authorization, recommends issuance or denial, and conducts the
surveillance of the aviation event. See FAA 8900.1, Flight Standards Information Management
System (FSIMS).
4.9. Foreign Military Teams. The considerations and procedures of this chapter also apply to
military teams sanctioned by other countries and approved by the FAA. Only the FAA may
issue the letter of approval for foreign military teams. Generally, Flight Standards personnel will
observe a private demonstration performance before the approval is issued. Submit requests for
foreign aircraft or foreign military demonstration team participation in unit open houses to
SAF/PA for coordination and approval. Performances at Air Force installations should be at no
additional cost to the government. Questions regarding performances by foreign teams in the
United States may be addressed to SAF/Public Affairs Secretary of Air Force (PAN).
18                                                            482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009


4.10. DoD-Sanctioned Parachute Teams. DoD has officially sanctioned the U.S. Army
Golden Knights and the U.S. Navy Leap Frogs as parachute teams. A team may have more than
one unit operating under the designated team name (for example, two Golden Knight teams--the
Black Team and the Gold Team--jumping at two different locations).
     4.10.1. The DoD-sanctioned military team determines site acceptability, effect of wind
     conditions, and location of exiting the aircraft. This includes the decision to exit over a
     spectator area and the determination of authorized passengers onboard the aircraft during
     performances.
     4.10.2. An application for a certificate of authorization must be submitted to the
     jurisdictional FAA/FSDO. Ensure the application for waiver contains a statement that the
     military command or service has determined that adequate safety margins exist at the site for
     the scheduled demonstration by the specific team on a specific date.
4.11. Non-Sanctioned DoD Parachute Teams. Other military jump teams, such as the U.S.
Navy's Chuting Stars and the U.S. Air Force Academy's Wings of Blue, are not DoD-sanctioned.
They may be allowed to perform the same jumps as civilians with a United States Parachute
Association (USPA) class D license. To jump over or into a congested area the unit is required
to meet the same standards as DoD-sanctioned teams and hold a USPA class D license.
4.12. Aerobatic Flight. For open house purposes, when the event is conducted in accordance
with a Certificate of Waiver or Authorization, the definition of aerobatic flight in FAA Federal
Aviation Regulation (FAA /FAR) 91.303 does not apply. Therefore, a waiver to FAA/ FAR
91.303 must always be requested. For guidance in determining what maneuvers are considered
aerobatic, reference FAA 8900.1, Volume 1, Chapter 1, Section 1.
4.13. Critical Aircraft/Critical Wingman. The critical aircraft or critical wingman is that
aircraft closest to a spectator area.
4.14. Crowd Line. A crowd line is a physical barrier or a line marked on the ground that serves
as a restraining line. The crowd line is placed at a specified distance from the show line. The
restraining line and any necessary policing must prevent spectators or other nonparticipating
people from getting too close to the show line. The Ground Operations Officer with the help of
CE will establish the crowd line including the DV seating area, primary viewing section and
distance needed from the show line to meet FAA standards and Air Force runway standards for
specific aircraft. Snow or foreign object debris (FOD) fencing is recommended for the crowd
line barrier to prevent FOD from blowing onto the taxiways.
     4.14.1. Attempt to center the spectator area on the DV seating area. A spectator area close to
     show center allows spectators to better hear the narration. The spectator area should be
     oriented so that it offers an unobstructed view of the show line in both directions. Movable
     objects, such as vehicles or aircraft, which would obstruct spectators‘ view of the show line,
     should be repositioned.
     4.14.2. All static display aircraft should be positioned well behind the crowd line.
4.15. Corner Markers. Corner markers are natural landmarks or identifying panels placed 500
feet from each end of the extended crowd line. They depict the minimum distance performers
may approach the crowd. They should be easily identifiable objects starkly contrasting with the
environment. If using panels, they should be 10‘ by 10‘.
482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009                                                                     19


4.16. Show Center. The show center is a visible reference point along the show line usually
denoting the center of the aerobatic area. If possible, locate show center in a highly visible area
such as a taxiway or intersection of a runway. Show center should also be aligned with a
building, road, or other feature identifiable from the air.
   4.16.1. The optimum position for show center is directly opposite the seating area and
   centered along the length of the crowd line. The show center marker should be a large,
   highly visible vehicle or marker; white, blue, or orange, or other color that starkly contrasts
   with the environment.
   4.16.2. Arrange the marker so it faces perpendicular to the show line to give the pilots a
   readily identifiable point that increases comfort levels and ensures the highest degree of
   safety.
   4.16.3. Buses and semi-truck trailers serve well as markers.
   4.16.4. If the edge of the runway is the show line, the vehicles should be placed at least 100
   feet off the runway so as not to interfere with takeoff or landing.
   4.16.5. Please be aware, a notice to airmen (NOTAM) may be required for placement of the
   markers if near an active runway. Check with the local airfield manager.
4.17. Bomb Burst Cross Point. Bomb burst cross points are used by demonstration teams.
The cross point for the bomb burst must be located on the show line, at a distance from show
center specified by the team. The area beneath the bomb burst run-in must not be densely
populated nor used for parking.
   4.17.1. The bomb burst cross point must also be marked with a highly visible object
   (preferably white or orange with high contrast to the surrounding area). If using vehicles, the
   vehicle must be located on, and facing parallel to, the show line. If the edge of the runway is
   the show line, the vehicles will be placed a minimum 100 feet off the runway.
   4.17.2. Like show center, the bomb burst cross point should be located in a highly visible
   area.
4.18. Control Point. A control point is a specified location where air boss, air operations
officer and IIC manage the event. The communications system with the capability necessary to
control the aviation event must also be located at this site. The staff should position its open
house operations center near the control point.
4.19. Primary Spectator Area. The primary spectator area is the main area designated for
spectator use. Safety must be the primary factor in selecting spectator areas. It is bounded by
the crowd line and has lateral limits (ends) that are well defined. This is the area where the
public is generally expected to view the open house. The primary area may be partitioned or
divided due to physical constraints associated with the location. Aircraft must not fly over the
designated spectator area unless specifically granted a waiver by the FAA.
4.20. Secondary Spectator Area. The secondary spectator area may be any other area where
people have a natural tendency to gather to observe the event for example, along a road adjacent
to base. The Open House Staff and the IIC should identify secondary spectator areas before the
aviation event begins and develop a plan to assure they are outside of the aerobatic box. These
are also areas where it may not be completely possible to control the presence of people.
However, the security forces will make every effort to prohibit secondary spectator areas.
20                                                          482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009


4.21. Show Line. The show line is a readily visible reference positioned the required distance
from the spectators and enhances pilot orientation during the performance. The show line also
serves as the longitudinal axis for the show. Small rivers, roads, and runways all make excellent
natural show lines. Snow fences spread flat on the ground may also make acceptable references,
depending on the visual contrast. Lines of parked buses, cars, or boats, although less desirable,
may be the only alternatives when natural show lines are not available. Special attention must be
given to delineating show lines properly for high performance jet aircraft. Large vehicles should
be used to designate show center and the bomb burst cross point to ensure they stand out from
the terrain. A surveyor or airborne observer should ensure the artificial show line is straight.
     4.21.1. To enhance safety, the show line may be moved toward or away from the spectator
     area to give the performer a more identifiable reference. However, the show line will not be
     moved closer to the primary spectator area than the minimum distance specified.
     4.21.2. Establish the minimum show line distance from the spectator area for all
     participating aircraft using Table 4.1. Under the circumstances listed below, the minimum
     distance can be reduced, as follows:
        4.21.2.1. To 1,000 feet, minimum, between the spectator area and the intended airdrop
        impact point, or to the drop zone boundary, whichever is greater, for the following: 1)
        On-base equipment airdrop demonstration; 2) On-base Container Delivery System
        demonstration; and 3) On-base airdrop demonstration of personnel using round canopies,
        also known as tactical airborne demonstrations. Tactical airborne demonstrations are
        conducted by paratroopers assigned to tactical units and employ standard military
        equipment and procedures.
        4.21.2.2. To 500 feet, minimum, between the spectator area and the show line for
        helicopter operational demonstrations, and for fixed-wing assault landing or assault
        takeoff demonstrations.
        4.21.2.3. To 50 feet, minimum, between the spectator area and the landing target for the
        airdrop of precision parachute demonstration teams (for example, the Wings of Blue)
        when steerable, square main and reserve canopies are used. The airdrop may include a
        High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) demonstration.
        4.21.2.4. To 15 feet, minimum, between the spectator area and the landing target for the
        airdrop of DOD sanctioned teams (Army Golden Knights or Navy Leap Frogs) or
        precision parachute demonstration team members who hold United States Parachute
        Association PRO-ratings when steerable, square main and reserve canopies are used.
4.22. Show Lines and Spectator Areas. Pilots performing flight demonstrations must maintain
minimum distances from the primary spectator area.
     4.22.1. For aerobatic and other flight demonstrations show lines must be established at
     prescribed minimum distances from the designated spectator area. These show lines are used
     as a reference by performing pilots or, in the case of a formation flight, by the formation
     leader. Flight demonstrations must not cross over these show lines toward the any spectator
     area.
     4.22.2. For formation flight demonstrations, the formation leader must adjust his/her ground
     track so that the critical wingman remains beyond the appropriate show line.
482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009                                                                21


   4.22.3. With the exception of the BD-5J, any turbine engine powered airplane will be
   required to perform on or beyond the Category I show line according to FAA regulations.
   Air Education and Training Command‘s (AETC) T-6 Texan II trainers are required to use the
   Category II show line.
   4.22.4. Show line categories, speeds, and distances are shown in Table 4-1 below. These
   speeds are only for determining assignment to a show line, not maximum performing speeds.
4.23. Establishment of Show Lines. As described in Table 4-1, three different show lines
might be required when all three categories of aircraft are participating at a show site.
   4.23.1. The show lines should be established first, preferably using natural markings; then
   set the appropriate crowd lines and designate spectator areas. It is important for all show
   lines to be well marked.
4.23.2. Aerobatic Box. The Wings Over Homestead‘s Aerobatic box primary spectator area is
adjacent to the transient alert ramp.

      * These are not operating limitations

4.24. Aerobatic Box. The aerobatic box is the area over which the aerobatic demonstrations are
approved to be performed (see Figure 4.1). It is usually centered on the show center; however,
22                                                          482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009


sometimes an offset show center is required. The width is determined by aircraft category and
the length is dependent on the performer. This is an important planning factor and should be
considered when contracting with performers. Some US jet teams require as much as 12,000
feet, consult the team‘s support manual. The Snowbirds and civilian teams typically require a
shorter box. The aerobatic box is also known as the aerobatic maneuvering area.

Figure 4.1. Aerobatic Box.




     4.24.1. The FAA requires that the aerobatic box be void of all people not specifically
     participating in the demonstration. This includes homes, businesses, roads and secondary
     spectator areas. The authorization for each person forward of the crowd line must be
     justified to the FAA FSDO.
        4.24.1.1. Personnel may be allowed in the box providing they are necessary to the
        operation of the event, are properly briefed, are in communication with the air boss, and
        all participants are aware of them. These personnel should be kept to a minimum.
        4.24.1.2. The safety of spectators is of the utmost importance. The strict nature of this
        FAA guidance means that access to this area must be controlled, and all spectators kept
        from entering the area. The aerobatic demonstration cannot begin, or may possibly be
        terminated, if unauthorized personnel access the area.
482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009                                                                      23


       4.24.1.3. Consideration should be given to those businesses and homes that may lie
       within the aerobatic box. Bases should consider making special arrangements for the
       affected parties to ensure cooperation and assurance that the box is clear. This may
       include inviting them to the Commander‘s DV area. The public affairs office can assist
       in notification and coordination.
4.25. Civil Fly-Ins. Civil aircraft operators may be invited to fly their aircraft to the 482 FW for
a base open house in lieu of driving to foster better relations with the local aviation community.
Refer to AFI 10-1001, Civil Aircraft Landing Permits, for civil fly-in procedures. If civil aircraft
owners request aircraft fuel, the base may sell only enough DoD fuel to get the aircraft to the
closest civilian airfield.
4.26. Civilian Aerial Demonstrations. Civilian performers may be invited to provide aerial
demonstrations, flyovers, and static displays. Keep in mind the logistic requirements for civilian
aircraft will be very different from military aircraft.
   4.26.1. MAJCOMs have approval authority for civilian demonstration teams participating in
   U.S. Air Force base open house programs.
4.27. Performer Qualifications. Ensure civilian performers have the proper qualifications and
will be current as of the date of the open house. These qualifications include:
   4.27.1. FAA pilot certificate (commercial certificate if receiving compensation).
   4.27.2. Insurance certificate or current years USAF landing permit number.
   4.27.3. FAA medical certificate (Class 2 if receiving compensation).
   4.27.4. FAA Form 8710-7, Statement of Aerobatic Competency (SAC), if performing
   aerobatics. There are four levels of aerobatic competency. Level 1 is unrestricted; level 2 is
   restricted to 250 ft AGL, level 3 - 500 ft AGL, and level 4 - 800 ft AGL. This form must
   have been issued in the preceding 12 months. The equivalent Canadian SAC is a Transport
   Canadian Aviation (TCA) Form 26-0307, Statement of Aerobatic Competency.
   4.27.5. Formation and Safety Team (FAST) card or formation annotated on the SAC if
   performing formation.
4.28. Civilian Aerobatic Formation Flight. Formation aerobatics may be performed only if
the team meets the practice and proficiency requirements established in FAA 8900.1. All teams
or individuals conducting formation aerobatics must have demonstrated or substantiated their
skills and have the ―Formation Aerobatics‖ notation placed on their Statement of Acrobatic
Competency.
4.29. Non-Aerobatic Formation Flight. Civil pilots who wish to conduct non-aerobatic
formation flight in waivered airspace for an open house must possess a FAST card or a similar
valid host nation formation training and evaluation credential that is acceptable to the FAA.
4.30. Orientation Flights. Guidelines for orientation flights on Air Force aircraft are contained
in AFI 11-401, Aviation Management. MAJCOMs may restrict orientation flights during open
houses. At no time will passengers be onboard any aerial demonstration aircraft or warbird
while flying in an open house performance.
4.31. Approved Maneuver. Aerobatic maneuvers may not direct energy toward any spectator
area or fly over the designated spectator area(s) below 1,000 feet AGL unless approved by the
24                                                           482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009


FAA. The FAA approves maneuver packages for the US military demonstration teams, and
Canadian Forces Snowbirds annually. Civil and/or foreign military teams, flights, or individual
acts must submit sufficient information about a single maneuver or series of maneuvers to the
FAA for approval before performing these types of maneuvers. For a more detailed discussion
of approved maneuvers, reference FAA 8900.1. Certain related maneuvers and procedures,
however, may be authorized as outlined below.
     4.31.1. Approved maneuvers that are completed prior to reaching a point where the rollout
     and trajectory of the aircraft or the scatter pattern would not endanger the spectators if a
     catastrophic failure were to occur. Approved maneuvers are maneuvers that have been
     approved by the FAA for a specific performer and aircraft. Upon request from the FAA,
     performers are required to present evidence of the approval.
     4.31.2. For the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds and/or U.S. Navy Blue Angels, approved
     maneuvers may include level or climbing (normal rate) non-aerobatic flight over designated
     spectator areas generally from front to back or back to front; however, in no case will the
     altitude of the aircraft be less than 500 feet AGL over primary spectator area. All other
     performers must be at or above 1,000 feet AGL over primary spectator areas unless they hold
     approval for the maneuver from the FAA.
     4.31.3. Maneuvers on an oblique line that pass 500, 1,000, or 1,500 feet to either side of a
     spectator area as appropriate to the category of aircraft being flown during oblique aerobatic
     maneuvers.
     4.31.4. All category aircraft performing non-aerobatic or photo passes may use the 500 foot
     show line and the corner markers.
4.32. Engine Run Areas. Aircraft engines will not be started and aircraft will not be taxied in
designated spectator areas or static display areas unless adequate measures are taken to protect
the spectators. This distance can be reduced to 50 feet with the presence of a physical barrier to
keep spectators away or by the use of wing-walkers, marshallers or crowd control monitors who
can prevent entry to the area by unauthorized people. Areas where engines and propellers will
be turning must be at least 100 feet from the spectator area and areas where rotors are turning
must be at least 200 feet from the spectator area. If moving aircraft from the static display area
during the open house, moveable crowd barriers and crowd control monitors will provide a
flexible means of securing the area.
4.33. Aircraft Parking Plans. The air operations director is responsible to identify parking
locations for all attending aircraft. Consider crowd control operations and emergency vehicle
access when determining parking locations. Also, consider whether aircraft should be refueled
before or after the event. Take into account the possibility of an explosion caused by fuel vapors
in empty tanks versus full fuel tanks. This will minimize the amount of fuel on the ramp should
an explosion occur. Note: Keep in mind that some aircraft require fuel while parked.
4.34. Maintenance Facilities. For safety of flight maintenance, the installation commander
may designate work areas to be used by non-DoD personnel for repairing an aircraft, grant
access to shop facilities, and if requested, permit assistance by qualified U.S. Air Force
maintenance personnel on a strictly voluntary basis. FAA certified maintenance personnel from
either a civilian or warbird organization will supervise all maintenance personnel. The U.S. Air
482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009                                                                    25


Force and any of its volunteer maintenance personnel will not be liable for any maintenance so
performed.
4.35. Temporary Flight Restrictions. Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) may be
implemented above the Homestead Class B airspace to protect performances that go above the
top limits of the airspace.
4.36. Communications. The local tower will designate what frequencies are used for the
performing aircraft. This is normally 143.8 (Runway 05 Center frequency). Arriving and
departing aircraft will communicate with the 482 FW/Command Post (CP) on 252.1 for UHF
and a VHF frequency designated by the local tower.
4.37. Special Events and Flights of a Spectacular Nature. Special events (i.e. car versus
aircraft race, etc) or flights not covered in AFI 11-209 or AFI 11-246 MDS Specific volume will
require SAF/PAN and USAF/XOO coordination, after the MAJCOM has accomplished
appropriate operational risk management assessments.
4.38. Aerial Event Survey. An aerial event survey is a feasibility survey of the airfield. It is
the first step in creating the FAA waiver request. It includes the following:
   4.38.1. Identify the aerobatic box. The show lines define the width of the box. The
   performers define the length of the box. The aerobatic box is usually centered on show
   center. Remember this area must be unpopulated during the performances.
   4.38.2. Identify airspace constraints such as Class B, C, and D airspace, airways, traffic
   patterns, other airports, special use airspace, controlling agencies.
   4.38.3. Identify local constraints, for example, obstructions (natural or man-made), noise
   sensitive areas, environmentally sensitive areas, roads, secondary spectator areas (include
   your own parking), and ingress/egress routes for demo teams.
   4.38.4. Identify local air traffic. Determine departure and arrival fields and routing.
   4.38.5. Identify other local events on same days -- fairs, races, festivals, etc.
   4.38.6. Identify impact on airfield tenants.
   4.38.7. Create an airfield diagram.
4.39. Airfield Diagram. Open House Staffs must produce a diagram of the airfield/show site.
Provide a copy to Civil Engineering to create any building/digging permits that might be
required. Coordinate changes to the diagram with all functional staff.
   4.39.1. As a minimum, the airfield diagram should depict:
       4.39.1.1. The complete aerobatic box.
       4.39.1.2. The primary spectator area and crowd line; the Category I, II, and III show
       lines with distances to the crowd line; corner markers and their distance to the end of the
       crowd line; and any secondary spectator areas.
       4.39.1.3. Show Center and Bomb Burst Cross points and latitude-longitude coordinates.
       4.39.1.4. Magnetic (MAG) bearing of the runway, depiction of Magnetic North, and the
       scale of the diagram.
       4.39.1.5. Active and closed runways, performer parking, taxiways and run-up areas.
26                                                               482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009


        4.39.1.6. The location of the aviation event control point, police dispatch, ambulance,
        fire-fighting equipment, First Aid locations.
        4.39.1.7. Parachute landing areas.
        4.39.1.8. Pyrotechnic areas (typically not used at the 911AW).
        4.39.1.9. Towers, vertical obstructions and no-fly or restricted zones or airspace.
     4.39.2. Each military demonstration team will have additional requirements for items to
     depict on the diagram.
4.40. The Air Show Waiver. A waiver to FAA regulations is required to conduct aerial
demonstrations and non-standard operations at open houses. The waiver is requested using a
FAA Form 7711-2, Application for Certification of Waiver or Authorization, figures 4.3a and
4.3b. The application is due 90 days prior to the event, but 120 days is recommended. The local
FAA FSDO may assist in the preparation of FAA Form 7711-2; however, the preparation and
submission of FAA Form 7711-2, as well as all of the necessary supporting documentation, are
the responsibility of the Open House Staff. The FAA will respond with FAA Form 7711-1,
Certificate of Waiver or Authorization and the special provisions for your event. Read it
carefully and ensure it is what you requested, and that you can comply with the provisions. The
air operations officer or the air boss must ensure the performers have read and understand the
special provisions.
4.40.1. This waiver is due early for performances that include the Blue Angels.
4.41. Completing the Application for Certificate of Waiver Authorization.
     4.41.1. Items 1 and 2 - name of organization and Open House Director
     4.41.2. Item 3 - permanent mailing address and phone number
     4.41.3. Item 4 - list all FAA FAR sections for which you are requesting waivers. Reference
     FAA FAR 91.905, General Operating and Flight Rules for a list of sections eligible for
     waiver. Also talk to potential performers and determine which sections they will need
     waived.
     4.41.4. Item 5 - state what type of performances will be taking place, i.e. ―Annual air show
     featuring non-aerobatic high and low speed flyovers, USAF demo teams, parachuting‖.
     4.41.5. Item 6 - define the area and altitude of the flight maneuvering airspace, i.e. ―Five
     mile radius from Latitude/Longitude (LAT/LONG) (i.e. ABC Air Force Base) (AFB),
     surface to 15000 MSL‖. Note: military demonstrations teams require 15,000 AGL.
     4.41.6. Item 7 - date and time of all arrival shows, practices, and performances. Give
     yourself a buffer on both sides of your time window to allow for slippage.
     4.41.7. Item 8 - list information as completely as possible and add at the bottom, ―a final list
     of pilots and parachutists will be provided on date”. Be sure to comply with your own
     deadline.
     4.41.8. Item 11 - detail positions of security forces, local police, volunteers, crowd barriers,
     road closures, and public address system.
     4.41.9. Item 12 - detail emergency facilities and assets.

                                              SERVICES

5.1. Open Houses. Open houses are community relations programs designed to educate the
public about the mission of the Air Force and the base. Generating revenue is not the primary
objective of conducting such events. The provisions outlined in AFI 34-262, Services Programs
And Use Eligibility must be strictly adhered to.
     5.1.1. Services can sponsor recreational events and activities held in conjunction with the
     open house or air show, and can provide full or partial Non-Appropriated Funds (NAF)
     support for activities like:
         5.1.1.1. Entertainment such as civilian performers, bands, comedy shows, fireworks, etc.
         (does not include civilian or military aerial or aerobatic demonstration teams).
         5.1.1.2. Bleachers or chairs in support of Services‘ booths, displays, events, or
         entertainment performances.
         5.1.1.3. Public address systems for the Services‘ elements of the event.
         5.1.1.4. Portable toilets for the Services‘ elements of the event.
         5.1.1.5. Open house or air show reception open to the entire base population.
         5.1.1.6. Inclement weather or rain insurance for the Services‘ elements of the event.
         5.1.1.7. Food, beverage, and souvenir concessions, operated directly by Services or by
         concessionaire contract. Refer to AFI 34-219, Alcoholic Beverage Program para 2.1.8,
         for information regarding serving of alcoholic beverages.
         5.1.1.8. Payments to unofficial activities or private organizations for operating
         concession booths (when included in a services or concessionaire contract).
         5.1.1.9. Marketing and publicity for Services programs or events (excludes costs
         normally associated with public affairs informing the public about the event).
         5.1.1.10. Souvenir programs for direct sale by Services‘ activities.
5.2. Commercial Sponsorship. Commercial sponsorship will be used for the Services‘ MWR
elements of the event and to offset logistical, subsidence, and, entertainment fees for performers.
5.3. Restrictions. Services cannot subsidize mission-related elements of the open house or air
show, or provide NAF or commercial sponsorship support for elements not related to Services
involvement. Do not provide funds, or allow funds generated from open houses and air shows,
to be used for:
     5.3.1. Socials, receptions, seating, or tents for exclusive use by certain groups or individuals.
     5.3.2. Seed money for future open houses or air shows.
     5.3.3. Transportation or lodging for military members or individuals not connected with
     Services-related events.
     5.3.4. Fuel for military or civilian aircraft.
482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009                                                                      31


   5.3.5. Any cost for which Appropriated Funds (APF) are authorized.
   5.3.6. Insurance for aerial or other demonstrations.
5.4. Concessionaire Contracts. Concessionaire contracts must adhere to the provisions of
paragraphs 5.2 and 5.3 above, and will not include arrangements for the contractor to advertise
the event, e.g., paid or free radio, or television announcements. This is a public affairs function.
5.5. Programs. Services activities and concessionaires can sell souvenir programs provided:
   5.5.1. There are no charges to APFs for Services‘ advertising included in programs.
   5.5.2. A disclaimer must accompany recognition of commercial sponsors.
   5.5.3. The programs are required in the overall contract with the open house or air show
   contractor or are purchased for direct sale by Services MWR activities using NAFs (if
   printing programs is required by the civilian enterprise base newspaper contract, programs
   cannot be sold). APFs are not expended in producing or distributing the programs.

                                            Chapter 6

                                FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

6.1. Availability of Appropriated Funds. Appropriated funds (APF) are available to finance
various aspects of open houses. APFs are only authorized for those portions of an open house
that exist to inform the public about the capabilities, equipment, training and professionalism of
the Air Force and its people. The essential elements of Open Houses are funded by APFs, which
are tax dollars that Congress has authorized the US Government to obligate to pay for goods and
services. APFs used for an Open House come from the same pot of funds used to operate the
base. Essential elements include those items used for the health, safety and comfort of the guests
of the Open House. Examples include fencing, trash containers, shuttle buses, security, air boss,
narrators, expenses incurred for warbird performers and static display participants. APFs cannot
be used to pay for food, drinks, live and/or recorded music, theatrical performances and any
other activities designed for entertainment.
6.2. USAF Aerial Demonstration Teams. The expenses incurred by all USAF crews flying
USAF-owned aircraft taking part in aerial demonstrations at an open house are financed with
APFs (O&M funds). Typical expenses include lodging, meals, transportation, pyrotechnics used
in the demonstrations and other requirements as established in the Thunderbird, Single-ship
Demo Team and Heritage Flight support manuals.
6.3. Funding Vintage Military Aircraft (Warbirds) Performances. Warbird crews and their
aircraft, which belong to not-for-profit organizations or individuals and which are contracted to
perform at open house events may be financed with APFs (O&M funds). The expenses would
be those normally associated with a non-personal services contract. Typical expenses that may
be financed with APFs are lodging, meals, transportation (at the open house location),
maintenance/hangar space, and any pyrotechnics used in the demonstration. Aviation
Gasoline/Jet Propellant-8 (AVGAS/JP-8) for rehearsals and actual performances may be
provided at Government expense. Fuel to fly from the open house location to the location from
which the warbird originated may be provided at Government expense. Warbird expenses may
not be funded with NAF funds. However, they may be funded by non-federal/private funds
donated by private organizations.
6.4. Funding Civil Aerial Performance (Non-warbird). APFs and nonappropriated funds
(NAFs) are not authorized to finance any costs incurred by crews or the aircraft of civilian aerial
performance individuals or teams. All charges, including lodging, meals, transportation, and
maintenance/hangar space, must be financed with non-federal/private funds donated by private
organizations.
6.5. Ground Displays. Military aircraft and other military equipment ground static and mobile
displays are funded with APFs. Warbirds static displays may be funded with APFs or non-
federal/private funds donated by private organizations. Civilian aircraft (non-warbird) are
funded with private funds only.
6.6. Facilities and Accommodations. Essential elements of expense for open house facilities
and accommodations are those expenses that would be incurred if there were no Services MWR
participation. Essential accommodations and facilities such as sanitation (trash containers, refuse
collection), health, safety, security (phones, radios), power outlets, professional public address
482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009                                                                     33


announcer, and general comfort of the public are funded with APF only. Public phones are a
NAF or private expense. Other elements of general expense may be funded by APF, NAF, or
private funds depending on the part of the open house being supported -- tents/booths/chalets
(see 1.11.), tables/chairs, bleachers, golf carts, rest rooms (port-o-johns), generators, lighting,
stage, public address system (other than the main system required for general safety and
security).
6.7. Crowd Control, Security, and Health/Safety. Expenses incurred to ensure security,
provide first aid, and facilitate safe movement and control the crowds attending the event are
funded with APFs. Typical expenses are for air-to-ground radios, first aid materials, lost and
found, fences, ropes/stanchions, transportation, parking/parking passes (no cost to public), and
signs and badges.
6.8. Publicity. U.S. Air Force open houses receive extensive local news coverage via print,
radio, and television throughout the United States. Public Service Announcements (PSAs)
should be used to the maximum extent before resorting to APF-funded advertising.
   6.8.1. Programs. Open house souvenir programs/events guide may be funded with NAFs if
   the base newspaper contractor does not have the rights to such publications. The NAF-
   funded programs may contain paid advertisements to cover the cost of the printing. They
   may also contain sponsor recognition. Paid advertising and sponsor recognition in programs
   must contain a disclaimer that the advertisement or recognition does not constitute U.S. Air
   Force endorsement of the product or service.
   6.8.2. Open House Website. A public base website to provide open house information may
   be funded with APFs. Outside organizations (non-federal/private) may establish a website to
   promote the open house. However, it must be abundantly clear to the viewer of the website
   that it is a USAF open house and not provided or operated by the sponsor. PA is responsible
   for security, policy and review of public websites, though a separate webmaster designated
   by the Air Show Director will maintain the website.
6.9. Entertainment. Any type of entertainment is funded either by NAF or private funds. The
typical entertainment, which is incidental to the primary purpose of the event, may be fireworks,
concerts, ground activities (moon bounce, jet truck, robosaurus, etc.) and/or kids‘ play area.
Services can sponsor recreational events and activities (i.e. food and entertainment) held in
conjunction with the open house and can provide full or partial NAF support. Additionally, open
houses must not be used as a venue for the display or sale of commercial products or services
outside the parameters of Services‘ commercial sponsorship program.
6.10. Concessions. The sale of food, beverages (including beer) and souvenirs is an activity
restricted to Services/MWR. The procurement of these is with NAFs, including NAFs resulting
from commercial sponsorship, and the receipts are accounted for in the NAF system. Private
sector organizations, including Warbirds, may accept donations and may sell souvenirs that do
not compete with Base Exchange (BX) items or those souvenirs being sold by Services/MWR.
6.11. DV/Very Important Person (VIP)/Hospitality Tents. A commander‘s hospitality tent,
as well as civic and social events occurring at the time of the open house, are considered protocol
activities and may be supported by Official Representation Funds (ORFs) if they comply with
AFI 65-603, Official Representation Funds - Guidance and Procedures. Services may make
arrangements for a sponsors‘ hospitality tent with food and beverages. The tent is to host
34                                                       482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009


sponsors providing support to the event or other Services events. The installation commander
may authorize hospitality tents, managed by a private concessionaire. The commander‘s
hospitality tent is not to be ―sponsored‖ and there are to be no sponsor signs in the area.
6.12. Funding Sources. Attachment 4 provides a funding source guide for specific AF open
house requirements.
482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009                                                                      35


                                            Chapter 7

                                      LEGAL GUIDANCE

7.1. Introduction. This chapter highlights some legal issues that may arise during open houses.
It should not be relied upon as legal authority, except to raise awareness of key legal concepts.
Any inconsistency between the guidance found in this chapter and specific official publications
must be resolved in favor of official publications. The organization‘s senior legal official, who is
normally the staff judge advocate, provides authoritative legal advice on a case-by-case basis.
Legal officials must be involved in all aspects of an AF open house.
   7.1.1. Traditionally, the 482 FW as well as the Air Force‘s public image has been promoted
   through public affairs channels, primarily through media and community relations that focus
   on Air Force activities. One of the best ways to advance the public‘s understanding of the
   AF mission is to invite them onto an installation for an ―open house‖ to see, first hand, the
   equipment, facilities, and people.
   7.1.2. Public affairs activities, to include open houses, trigger significant standards of
   conduct (or ethics) and fiscal law issues because they involve Federal employees using
   government resources to further the agency‘s mission. In other words, military personnel,
   civilian employees, reserve and guard members, special government employees, and
   volunteers who support an open house are carrying out official duties and must therefore
   comply with all DoD and AF rules and policies.
7.2. Command Authority During an Open House
   7.2.1. The installation commander has inherent authority to restrict political and dissident
   activity on a military base. Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 1325.6, Guidelines for
   Handling Dissident and Protest Activities Among Members of the Armed Forces, para
   C(5)(e); Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S. 828, 47 96 S.Ct. 1211, 47 L.Ed.2d 505 (1976); OpJAGAF
   1993/21, 3 Mar 93. Holding an open house does not change this fundamental concept. Thus,
   the notices and warnings posted at an installation‘s gates about restrictions on conduct, which
   are applicable to those who enter a Federal installation, apply even when the public as a
   whole is invited onto the premises.
   7.2.2. Military bases are generally not public forums. Therefore, commanders should
   prohibit demonstrations inside an installation "which could result in interference with or
   prevention of orderly accomplishment of the mission of the installation… or present[s] a
   clear danger to loyalty, discipline, or morale of [the troops]." DoDD 1325.6, para C(5)(e);
   AFI 51-903, Dissident and Protest Activities, para 6. If a demonstration or unauthorized
   activity begins to take place during an open house, legal and security forces must be ready to
   respond immediately.
   7.2.3. Base open houses do not turn a base into a public forum for purposes of First
   Amendment rights. See Persons for Free Speech at SAC v. United States Air Force, 675 F2d
   1010 (8th Cir 1982), cert. den. 549 U.S. 1092, 103 S.Ct 579, 74 L.Ed.2d 939(1982); See also
   Shopco Distribution Co. v. Commanding General, Camp Lejeune, 885 F2d 167 (4th Cir
   1989) (on base housing area of Marine Corps base is not a public forum).
36                                                              482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009


        7.2.3.1. However, portions of a base, which are generally open to the public, may be
        public forums for First Amendment purposes. U.S. v. Gourley, 502 F2d 785 (10th Cir
        1974) (Chapel, football stadium at Air Force Academy). The key is whether the Air
        Force ordinarily exercises control over the area; that is, does the base ordinarily preclude
        non-DOD personnel from access to the property. If that is the case, an open house will
        not change the commander‘s authority to control and protect that area.
     7.2.4. Installation officials must anticipate that demonstrations, dissident activities, political
     speeches, and other unauthorized or disruptive behavior may occur during the open house.
     Both the staff judge advocate and the chief of security forces should develop an operations
     plan to respond to, control, and legally process any person who seeks to disrupt the event,
     damage government property, or harm event participants. Planning will involve coordination
     with local law enforcement personnel, as well as with the appropriate Assistant United States
     Attorney.
7.3. Standards of Conduct Consideration.
     7.3.1. The Office of Government Ethics (OGE) establishes uniform standards of conduct
     (also known as ―ethics‖) rules for the entire Executive Branch of the Federal Government.
     The ethics rules are the minimum standards of ethical conduct within the U.S. Government
     and serve as the starting point for ethical conduct.
     7.3.2. The Joint Ethics Regulation (JER), DOD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation, is the
     Department of Defense‘s regulation on standards of conduct. It incorporates the OGE rules
     into DOD policy and supplements them with rules unique to DOD personnel.
        7.3.2.1. The JER addresses individual ethical conduct; that is, what employees may and
        may not do as they carry out their official (and sometimes personal) activities. It
        regulates conduct concerning personal gifts, conflicts of interest, use of government
        resources, use of one‘s government position, and other work-related activities.
        7.3.2.2. For agency conduct, all of the Department of Defense (DoD) and AF
        publications listed in the Glossary of References (Attachment 1) impact Air Force
        activities in holding an open house. The publications that deal most directly with
        community relations are DoD Directive 5410.18, Public Affairs Community Relations
        Policy, DoDI 5410.19, Public Affairs Community Relations Policy Implementation, and
        AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures.
        7.3.2.3. It is important to follow agency regulations closely because violations could
        trigger punitive measures. For example, misusing public office and/or official resources,
        giving preferential treatment, violating fiscal law principles, or not addressing conflicts of
        interest could lead to disciplinary action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for
        military members and personnel regulations for civilian employees.
        7.3.2.4. The staff judge advocate‘s office must be involved in all stages of event
        planning, from the first meeting to the after-action report. Many of the fiscal and JER
        issues are complex and can only be evaluated with the help of a trained attorney.
7.4. Key Ethics Considerations
482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009                                                                      37


  7.4.1. Endorsement. DoD personnel may not officially endorse, or appear to endorse, any
  non-Federal entity, event, product, service or enterprise, including membership drives or
  fundraising activities.
     7.4.1.1. The term ―any non-Federal entity‖ includes: charities; non-profit associations;
     private organizations; professional groups; commercial endeavors; foreign governments;
     contractors; and non-government individuals.
     7.4.1.2. To ―endorse‖ means to promote, support with approval, or sponsor without
     authority. This means AF personnel cannot use their official office, title or position to
     suggest Air Force support of a private entity.       Personnel are also prohibited from
     personally endorsing any non-Federal entity if their actions are connected to their USAF
     position in any way.
  7.4.2. Preferential Treatment. A closely related principle is that community relations
  activities shall not support, or appear to support, any activity that provides a selective benefit
  to any individual, group or organization. Thus, when USAF support is provided to one non-
  federal entity, the approving official must be able and willing to provide support to
  comparable non-federal entities.
     7.4.2.1. Many organizations seek affiliation with the Air Force. Sometimes their purpose
     is laudable (i.e., a genuine desire to support the Air Force). Sometimes their purpose is
     self-serving (i.e., a desire to share in the Air Force‘s prestige and public support).
     Determining a private organization‘s true purpose can be very difficult.
  7.4.3. Solicitation. Federal employees may not solicit (i.e. ask for) gifts, prizes, awards,
  services, or other benefits for themselves or for their agencies. A gift that has been solicited
  by an employee for the Air Force must be rejected outright -- even if it would otherwise have
  been acceptable.
     7.4.3.1. Once an offer has been initiated by a non-federal entity, AF personnel may
     follow up with specific guidance and information, but they can‘t initiate the offer or
     ―plant the idea‖ first.
  7.4.4. Free Services or Benefits. The general rule is that the USAF must pay for any
  services it receives; thus, in most cases, the USAF may not accept volunteer services, such as
  free consulting services, free volunteer support, free advertising, free rental cars, etc.
     7.4.4.1. The problem is that an offer of ―free‖ support may change into a claim for
     payment against the government; the government has few defenses once the services
     have been provided. Thus, the acceptance of a free offer may trigger government liability
     for payment without authority to do so. This is very serious and ratification (after-the-
     fact approval) is not always authorized.
  7.4.5. Quid Pro Quo Arrangements. The term ―Quid pro Quo‖ means literally ―something
  for something,‖ or the giving of one valuable thing for another valuable thing. Except for
  contracting officials, AF personnel do not have legal authority to bind the government to any
  financial obligation.
     7.4.5.1. While there are certain exceptions to this rule (e.g.. the Commercial Sponsorship
     Program), avoid any arrangement that appears to be a quid pro quo arrangement without
     the advice of a staff judge advocate or contracting officer.
38                                                             482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009


        7.4.5.2. Be extremely careful not to commit the Air Force to an obligation with an
        outside organization without legal advice and clear authority to do so.
     7.4.6. Fundraising. Air Force employees may voluntarily participate in private organization
     activities as individuals in their personal capacities, provided they act exclusively outside the
     scope of their official positions. This means that Air Force employees may not use or allow
     the use of their official titles, position, or organizational names in connection with activities
     performed in their personal capacities.
        7.4.6.1. This does not, however, preclude the use of military grade and department as
        part of an individual‘s name (e.g., Captain Smith, USAF) as other conventional titles are
        used.
        7.4.6.2. Air Force employees may not personally solicit funds from subordinates or from
        prohibited sources. This restriction does not apply to sales booth activities conducted by
        members of private organizations as part of an open house.
        7.4.6.3. Air Force employees may conduct fundraising efforts away from the workplace,
        in their personal capacity (i.e., on personal time), if base officials have approved the
        event.
     7.4.7. Conflicts of Interest. Air Force employees are prohibited by criminal laws from
     participating personally and substantially in any official matter that may impact their
     financial interests, or the financial interests of someone with whom they have a covered
     relationship (such as a close family member, potential employer, private organizations).
     Even the appearance of a conflict of interest must be avoided.
        7.4.7.1. Air Force employees must also remain impartial in dealing with official issues
        that involve a private organization with which they are associated in a personal capacity.
        Employees are generally prohibited from engaging in any official activities in which a
        private organization is a party or has a financial interest if the employee is an ―active
        participant‖ in the private organization or has been an officer within the last year.
            7.4.7.1.1. The term ―active participant‖ includes service as an official of the
            organization, such as a committee chairperson or organization spokesman. It also
            includes significant time devoted to promoting specific programs, including
            fundraising efforts. Thus, an Air Force official who takes an active role in a base-
            affiliated private organization cannot make a decision in an official capacity that will
            directly affect the private organization‘s financial status. Acting in both capacities
            (official and personal) violates the conflict of interest rules.
7.5. Key Fiscal Considerations.
     7.5.1. Congress regulates virtually all Executive Branch programs and activities through the
     appropriations process. Congress has enacted fiscal controls, which, if violated, subject the
     offender to serious adverse personnel actions and criminal penalties. This means that all Air
     Force officials must be conscious of funding issues throughout the planning and execution
     stages of open houses.
     7.5.2. Title 31 United States Code (USC) Section 1341, Anti-Defeciency Act - Limitations on
     Expending and Obligating Amounts, prohibits any government officer or employee from
     making or authorizing an expenditure or obligation in excess of the amount available in an
482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009                                                                      39


   appropriation; making or authorizing expenditures or incurring obligations in excess of
   formal subdivisions of funds, or amounts permitted by regulations; incurring an obligation in
   advance of an appropriation, unless authorized; or accepting voluntary services unless
   otherwise authorized by law 31 USC § 1342, Limitation on Voluntary Services.
   7.5.3. The Anti-deficiency Act also limits the use of voluntary services. An officer or
   employee may not accept voluntary services or employ personal services exceeding those
   authorized by law, except for emergencies involving the safety of human life or the
   protection of property.
       7.5.3.1. Voluntary services are those services rendered without a prior contract for
       compensation or without an advance agreement that the services will be gratuitous.
       7.5.3.2. Voluntary service and gratuitous services are not the same thing. It is not a
       violation of the Anti-deficiency Act to accept gratuitous (i.e., free) services from a person
       who agrees, in advance and in writing, to waive entitlement to compensation. On the
       other hand, an employee may not waive compensation if a statute establishes entitlement,
       unless another statute permits waiver.
   7.5.4. Acceptance of gratuitous services may be an improper augmentation of an
   appropriation if Federal employees normally would perform the work, unless a statute
   authorizes gratuitous services.
7.6. Gifts to the Air Force
   7.6.1. A Federal statute 10 USC § 2601, General Gift Funds authorizes the Secretary of the
   Air Force to accept and use gifts of personal or real property to carry out the Air Force
   mission. Gifts may be conditional (with restrictions) or unconditional (no restrictions). The
   Secretary has delegated his authority to accept gifts to subordinate officers, down to and
   including installation commanders. It is important to note that there is no authority to solicit
   a gift; the Air Force may only accept unsolicited gifts.
   7.6.2. AFI 51-601, Gifts to the Department of the Air Force, establishes the procedures for
   receiving, processing and accepting gifts. Although most gifts are processed under this
   guidance, other instructions govern different types of gifts:
       7.6.2.1. Gifts to a Non-Appropriated Fund organization -- see AFI 34-201.
       7.6.2.2. Gifts to religious funds -- see AFI 52-101.
       7.6.2.3. Gifts from foreign governments to individuals -- see AFI 51-901.
       7.6.2.4. Gifts to individuals -- see JER, Chapter 2.
       7.6.2.5. Gifts of travel benefits -- see 31 USC § 1353, Acceptance of Payment from a
       Non-Federal Source, Title 41, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 304-1, Payment
       of Travel Expenses From a Non-Federal Source.
   7.6.3. Ordinarily, officials may accept gifts offered to the Air Force unless acceptance would
   not be in the best interest of the Air Force. The authority to accept a gift depends upon the
   value of the gift. As a rule of thumb, gifts valued over $50,000 may only be accepted at the
   Secretarial level. Gifts of $50,000 or less may be accepted at the MAJCOM and FOA-level
   or, if delegated, to Numbered AF and installation commanders. If there has been no
40                                                             482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009


     delegation from higher headquarters, installation commanders have authority to accept gifts
     valued at $5,000 or less.
     7.6.4. In order to protect both the Air Force and the donor, all gifts (regardless of value)
     must be processed in accordance with AFI 51-601. The process can be summarized as
     follows:
        7.6.4.1. Determine if it is a conditional or unconditional gift;
        7.6.4.2. Determine the category of gift (i.e., real estate, personal property, cash, checks,
        securities).
        7.6.4.3. Determine the value of the gift and the approval authority.
        7.6.4.4. Staff the gift acceptance package through the office with functional authority
        over the gift (i.e., the subject matter expert), the legal office, and the installation
        commander.
        7.6.4.5. Send a written acceptance or rejection letter to the donor.
7.7. Activities That Must be Avoided.
     7.7.1. Engaging in, or permitting, political activities, dissident or protest activities on the
     installation before, during or after the open house.
     7.7.2. Permitting non-Air Force affiliated private entities or charities to conduct fundraisers
     during the open house.
     7.7.3. Permitting commercial enterprises or sales in connection with the open house, unless
     expressly authorized under an Air Force policy or program.
     7.7.4. Soliciting or accepting gifts or volunteer services without proper legal review and
     processing.
7.8. Activities That Can be Authorized.
     7.8.1. Provide official resources and support to open houses in accordance with DoD and
     USAF publications.
     7.8.2. Accept gifts from outside sources, but only in accordance with AFI 51-601.
     7.8.3. Accept free publicity, media attention, and public comments from non-Federal entities
     related to the open house.
     7.8.4. Use of Air Force public affairs resources to educate and inform the public about Air
     Force accomplishments, capabilities, and other mission-related activities.
     7.8.5. Use of contracts and the Commercial Sponsorship Program to obtain resources and
     support beyond what Air Force personnel can provide (see Attachment 4).
482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009                                                                  41


                                          Chapter 8

                                      CONTRACTING

8.1. General. Identification of purchase requirements early in the planning for the open house
is critical to success. An experienced contracting person will be assigned to the Open House
Staff to provide business advice, help with the development of requirements, and ensure
compliance with acquisition regulations and laws.
8.2. Local Purchase Support for Open Houses.
   8.2.1. Local purchase requests (i.e. staff support, performers, etc.) for open house
   requirements should be coordinated with Contracting and Finance as early in the planning
   process as possible. The Contracting coordinator will ensure the Federal Acquisition
   Regulation (FAR) to include all Supplements and laws are followed to include adequate
   competition, fair and reasonable pricing, and small business requirements, etc. Only
   Contracting Officers have the authority to enter into contracts on behalf of the Government.
   The Open House Director and his staff shall not directly book vendors/demonstrators without
   consulting with the Contracting coordinator assigned to their team. Improperly entering into
   an agreement or contract could result in an unauthorized commitment and may result in
   disciplinary action.
   8.2.2. Vendors/performers should not be paid in advance of services performed, though they
   may have the right to a settlement if an open house is cancelled and a contract to perform is
   terminated.
   8.2.3. If necessary, the Contracting coordinator may assist vendors in registering in the
   Central Contractor Registration (CCR) as required by FAR 4.11.
   8.2.4. The Open House Director and staff should consult with Budget on which requirements
   should be procured with appropriated funds and which with non-appropriated funds, see the
   Funding Source Guide at attachment 4. All purchases made with the Government Purchase
   Card (GPC) will comply with AFI 64-117, Air Force Government-Wide Purchase Card
   (GPC) Program. Consult with the base GPC Program Manager for advice on proper use of
   the GPC.
8.3. Base Service/Support Contracts. Additional service/support requirements for an open
house (i.e. Transient Alert) should be coordinated well in advance of the event with contracting
and the functional owner of the service (i.e. Maintenance Operation Squadron). These
requirements may require contract modification and additional funding depending on the nature
of the requirement and structure/scope of the contract.
8.4. Other Guidance. There is additional information impacting contracting decisions
throughout this instruction.

                                           Chapter 9

                                           SAFETY

9.1. Introduction. Safety must be a prime consideration at all times during all phases of open
house planning and execution. The base safety staff will continually coordinate with the Open
House Staff during the planning and execution of the open house to ensure all safety criteria and
concerns are met and addressed. The safety staff, alone, cannot identify every safety concern or
ensure all guidelines are followed. Operational Risk Management (ORM) is a Commander‘s
program, and as such, ORM trained facilitators from every functional area will help identify any
hazards and mitigate unnecessary risks via an ORM assessment and assist with the open house
ORM as directed by the Open House Director (Ref: AFI 90-901, Operational Risk Management
and AFPD 90-9, Operational Risk Management). Ensure the safety staff and Open House
Director are notified of any unresolved safety issues/questions as well all mishaps that involve
injuries or property damage before, during, and after the open house. Every functional area will
assist in compiling the ―After Action‖ report to identify ―Lessons Learned‖ and any safety
concerns.
9.2. References. There are many regulations and publications that address safety considerations
during open houses. Table 9.1 provides a general listing of regulations/publications that address
safety related procedures or safety concerns at open houses. All applicable regulations must be
reviewed to ensure the appropriate safety precautions and stipulations are followed. The
guidance contained in the listed regulations is not a replacement for common sense; the guidance
will dictate that certain steps or procedures are followed, but it cannot encompass every
eventuality. Activities or procedures not addressed by published guidance should be reviewed
with safety in mind, and appropriate caution and sound judgment should be exercised.
9.3. General Responsibilities for All Involved Agencies.
     9.3.1. Assist the Open House Director in managing risks. Risk management is the effective
     use of available resources (i.e., time, manpower, and funding) to prioritize and complete
     actions required to reduce risk. Four principles govern all actions associated with the
     management of risk. These principles, continuously employed, are applicable before, during,
     and after all tasks and operations.
        9.3.1.1. Accept no unnecessary risk. Unnecessary risk comes without a commensurate
        return in terms of real benefits or available opportunities. All Air Force missions and
        daily routines involve risk. The most logical choices for accomplishing a mission are
        those that meet all mission requirements while exposing personnel and resources to the
        lowest acceptable risk.
        9.3.1.2. Make risk decisions at the appropriate level. Making risk decisions at the
        appropriate level establishes clear accountability. Those accountable for the success or
        failure of the mission must be included in the risk decision process.
        9.3.1.3. Accept risk when benefits outweigh the costs. All potential benefits should be
        compared to all potential costs. The process of weighing risks against opportunities and
        benefits helps to maximize capability. However, ORM cannot be used to violate safety
        standards or requirements.
482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009                                                                      43


       9.3.1.4. Integrate ORM into operations and planning at all levels of the open house. To
       effectively apply risk management, dedicate time and resources to integrate ORM
       principles into planning and operational processes. Risk assessments of operations are
       mission supportive when they are done as a normal way of conducting a mission, not an
       add-on process performed by people not otherwise involved. To support these principles,
       the Open House Director will apply ORM during all aspects of preparation (planning,
       organizing, training, equipping, and sustaining) and employment of open house
       resources. (Ref: AFI 90-901 and AFPD 90-9).
9.4. Chief of Safety Responsibilities. Assign, as a minimum, a qualified primary and alternate
ground, weapons and flight safety personnel to serve on the open house safety staff. Continuous
coverage should be provided in all planning, preparations, operations and cleanup phases of the
open house. The Chief of Safety and his staff will:
   9.4.1. Ensure all applicable Air Force, federal, state and local safety requirements are met
   and followed.
   9.4.2. Work closely with the Open House Director, Fire Department Technical Services,
   Bioenvironmental Engineers, Public Health and the Environmental Office to ensure safety
   issues are identified and resolved.
   9.4.3. Ensure previous open house ―Lessons Learned‖ are reviewed for safety discrepancies
   and planning purposes.
   9.4.4. Review all applicable federal and state Occupational Safety and Health
   Administration (OSHA) regulations, national consensus standards, Uniform Building Codes
   in effect, Air Force Office of Safety and Health (AFOSH) Standards, Air Force Instructions,
   Technical Orders, MAJCOM and local guidance that apply to open house operations and
   areas.
   9.4.5. Develop local checklists as needed to ensure all areas are properly inspected.
9.5. Ground Safety Responsibilities. Ground Safety will coordinate with all functional areas
during the planning and execution phases of the open house. Particular coordination is required
with the following agencies emphasizing the stated areas:
   9.5.1. Security. Miami-Dade County is normally responsible for off-base traffic plans and
   flowing all attendees to designated Open House entry points. HARB security is responsible
   for the visitor-parking plan, open house worker parking, crowd control, pedestrian routes,
   emergency vehicle parking and routes, vehicle and golf cart use on aircraft ramp and open
   house area. Ensure planned re-supply routes for vendors avoid and minimize vehicle
   movement through crowds. Prohibit bicycles, skates, animals, rollerblades, skateboards, etc.,
   in the spectator area.
   9.5.2. Contracting. Ensure proper FAR safety clauses are included in all open house
   contracts. Vendors must comply with all federal and state safety requirements, laws and
   regulations and any base requirements. Obtain from Civil Engineering applicable local,
   state, etc., regulations and ordinances and existing sanitation standards established by local or
   state authorities. When contracting mechanical rides for kid zones, ensure the rides meet any
   federal, state or host nation inspection requirements.
44                                                             482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009


     9.5.3. Services. Ensure all booth workers are trained for booth operation, including fire,
     safety and health issues. Booths must be properly equipped and properly staffed. Coordinate
     on the plan for booth location and required equipment. Cooking booths will be located at
     least 50 feet from the aircraft display areas. Both booths and tents must be properly secured
     to prevent damage from high winds. Bleacher seating must comply with Consumer Product
     Safety Commission Publication #330, Guidelines for Retrofitting Bleachers, current Uniform
     Building Codes (chapter 4.section 1 008 of UBC), local laws, and NFPA Life Codes.
     Minimize tent lines/anchors intrusions into the public walkway. When anchors (spikes)
     intrude into the walkway, anchors and lines must be properly identified/marked to alert
     personnel of their presence. If tasked to provide mechanical rides in a ― kid zone‖, ensure
     adequate fall zone protection is provided and that equipment has been properly inspected.
     Pre-mix soft drink dispensing systems that contain a pressurized CO2 gas cylinder are
     prohibited. Post-mix systems (Bag ―N‖ Box) are authorized for use.
     9.5.4. Fire Department. Ensure proper location of firefighting equipment, emergency
     response vehicles and routes, fire extinguishers and fire safety requirements. Emergency
     vehicles must not be ―trapped‖ behind the crowd line. Booth inspections and booth fire
     extinguisher requirements must be met. Ensure all cooking fuel sources meet safety
     requirements, designated smoking areas are identified and that no smoking or open flames or
     sparks are allowed near any aircraft or fuel source per AFIs and AFOSH Standards. If
     pyrotechnic displays are to be employed by any performers, closely coordinate with the
     performer/contractor and ensure all applicable safety, transportation, storage, and
     employment requirements are met.
     9.5.5. Bioenvironmental Engineering. Ensure all health requirements are met and identify
     any ergonomics issues. All hazardous materials used for the air show are required to be
     identified and properly handled, including those used by civilian vendors. Adequacy and
     access to potable drinking water for the public and for air show workers must be considered.
     Ensure adequate public access to toilets for the size of the estimated number of visitors to the
     air show. Determine work/rest cycles for air show personnel and heat index.
     9.5.6. Public Health. Ensure food is safely prepared and food service workers are qualified
     and trained according to Air Force and local requirements.
     9.5.7. Ground Operations Officer. Ensure Static Display aircraft comply with Technical
     Order (T.O.) 00-80G-1-WA-1, Make Safe Procedures for Public Static Display, and the
     appropriate aircraft -2 series/equipment technical orders. The display/parking plan for
     aircraft, equipment, and vendor areas will be identified. Ensure all command and local
     guidance on static displays is implemented. Safety of all operations and events is of utmost
     importance. If public has access to aircraft hangers, remove all equipment such as
     maintenance stands, Aerospace Ground Equipment, and make safe all fire suppressions
     systems. Lock out and tag out hanger door controls as necessary. Ensure a safe plan for re-
     supply of vendor areas and safe movement of vehicles is established and followed in the air
     show area. If golf carts are used, drivers will be properly trained according to local
     requirements. Maintenance stands used for public access to aircraft must be serviceable and
     properly secured. Limit the number of people allowed on stands to avoid exceeding
     maximum weight limits.
482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009                                                                      45


   9.5.8. Emergency Response Coordinator (a.k.a. Designated On-Scene Commander). Ensure
   that the Survival Recovery Center/Emergency Operations Center (SRC/EOC) is activated
   during all open house flying periods. Ensure Emergency Operations Center (EOC)
   representatives are on base, in uniform and ready to respond to any mishap. EOC
   representatives should have distinguishing individual and vehicle badges to allow SF to
   facilitate their movement to the designated assembly area following a mishap/emergency.
   9.5.9. Medical. Adequate medical stations should be set up and manned as necessary to
   handle disaster response and worker and public illness and injuries. Necessary emergency
   medical transportation will be available as needed including ground and air transport. Report
   all injuries to the Open House Director and the safety staff.
   9.5.10. Vehicles Operations. Ensure adequate vehicles are assigned and bus routes are
   identified. Operators should be properly licensed and trained. Limit or prohibit vehicles in
   crowd areas and along pedestrian routes. Arrange for safe vehicle refueling or electrical
   recharging. Seatbelts will be worn and personnel will not stand up in the back of vehicles
   when the vehicle is in motion.
   9.5.11. Fuels. Ensure proper fuel is available for air show aircraft. When outside fuels are
   brought on base to support open house aircraft (specifically, Aviation Grade Gasoline
   brought to civilian aircraft), take steps to ensure fuels are not dispensed to the wrong aircraft
   or commingled. Fueling is not allowed in the static display area when the public is present
   (within 100 ft). Guidance in AFOSH Standard 91-38, Hydrocarbon Fuels-General, must be
   followed. Ensure routes for refueling vehicles are identified.
   9.5.12. Engineering. National Electric Code or host nation electrical requirements should be
   identified for required electrical power in the open house area and booths. Ensure electrical
   cables are approved for outdoors use and do not present a tripping hazard. All circuit
   breakers should be closed and secured to prevent unauthorized access.
9.6. Flight Safety Responsibilities
   9.6.1. Much of the existing guidance addressing aerial demonstrations, flyovers, etc. is
   aimed at establishing a safe flying environment for the aircrews, the spectators, and the
   surrounding community. The air operations officer and Air Boss must be familiar with
   applicable publications, and ensure the planned open house activities conform to them. Most
   of these publications are listed in Table 9.1. The base wing safety office will closely
   coordinate with the air operations officer and Air Boss to help resolve any Flight Safety
   issues/challenges raised during open house planning/execution. Each flying day, the Air
   Operations Officer, air boss, announcer, tower chief, Chief of Safety and Fire Chief will meet
   after the crew briefing to review the accident/incident plan.
   9.6.2. The wing safety office will review all local Mishap Response Plans to ensure they are
   up to date and ensure all appropriate agencies have ready access to them in the event of a
   mishap during the open house.
   9.6.3. Recommended Precautionary Measures.
       9.6.3.1. Participate in the planning and conduct of a Major Accident Response Exercise
       (MARE) prior to the open house, as required in AFI 10-2501-_Air Force Reserve
       Command (AFRC) Supplement (SUP), Air Force Emergency Management (EM)
46                                                              482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009


        Program and Planning Operations, Table 10.1. The scenario should be based around an
        open house aviation mishap scenario and should include off-base emergency response
        forces that will be participating in the open house. Involve as many personnel as possible
        that will be on mishap response duty during the open house.
        9.6.3.2. Identify the Interim Safety Investigation Board members and their planned
        operating location prior to the open house. They should be on call, preferably on base,
        during any scheduled aerial demonstrations or flyover to facilitate a quick response.
     9.6.4. Airfield Operations/Manager.        Coordination is required with the Airfield
     Operations/Airfield Manager. There are restrictions on what activities, structures, etc. can be
     conducted or located in the Clear Zone and Accident Potential Zones. These zones may
     affect planned activities within 3,000‘ of the runway centerline. Ensure coordination with
     the Airfield Manager for planned use of all land around and near the runways. Planned
     pyrotechnic displays are an example of one activity that may be affected by these zones.
9.7. Weapons Safety Responsibilities. Commanders should perform a Commander‘s Risk
Assessment as identified in AFMAN 91-201, Explosive Safety Standards, item 1.5, which
includes the importance of documenting Operational Risk Acceptance procedures as identified in
AFI 90-901 for all open house operational hazards, including explosives safety. Coordinate the
requirements of DoD 6055.9-STD, DoD Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards, and
AFMAN 91-201, with your command and base-level safety office for all open house events to
ensure that weapons and explosives hazards are properly addressed to reduce the risk of injury or
property damage to civilian and/or military resources. Contractor supported explosives
operations are required to be approved in accordance with these regulations. Common areas of
review during the Commander‘s Risk Acceptance include compliance with AFMAN 91-201 for
the use of explosives associated with static and public displays, fireworks displays, aerial
demonstrations, etc. Table 9.1 provides some references for these common areas of explosives
concerns but should not be used in lieu of the reading of the proper publications.
9.8. Mishaps and Events. Report and investigate every mishap/event IAW AFI 91-204,
Investigating and Reporting Mishaps. The commander may need to conduct a separate
investigation if there might be resulting liability or litigation issues.
9.9. Pyrotechnical Displays During Open Houses. If pyrotechnic displays are used by any of
the demonstrations scheduled for the open house, the overriding emphasis has to remain on the
safety of all in attendance, as well as those who use the airfield after the event is over.
     9.9.1. Considerations. There are numerous safety considerations that must be considered in
     the planning, employment, and execution of a pyrotechnic demonstration. The following is
     not an all-encompassing list of potential risks, but merely serves to highlight some areas for
     increased awareness and closer scrutiny:
        9.9.1.1. Grass fires (pre, during, and post release).
        9.9.1.2. Unplanned/premature detonation during transportation, set-up, operation, and
        teardown.
        9.9.1.3. Unauthorized personnel straying into the pyrotechnic area.
        9.9.1.4. Shrapnel from detonator pieces, nearby rocks, sticks, wooden stakes etc. causing
        injury/damage to spectators, aircraft, or staff.
482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009                                                                   47


     9.9.1.5. Air blast/pressure wave damage to structures, aircraft, or personnel.
     9.9.1.6. FOD to runways/taxiways following the demonstration.
     9.9.1.7. Exceeding authorized capacity of available storage facilities (i.e. EOD,
  9.9.2. Risk. The desire for a crowd-pleasing show must not lead to the acceptance of undue
  risk. Ensure the use of pyrotechnics, both in number and size of detonations, is as limited to
  the minimum required to achieve the desired affect and that the display is adequately
  displaced from the crowd. The open house safety staff must be aware of the risks inherent to
  a pyrotechnic demonstration and ensure that appropriate risk management measures are
  discussed with/implemented by the demonstrator/contractor. A good primer that addresses
  these issues in more detail is Pyrotechnics and Special Effects for Air Shows, a publication of
  the International Council of Air Shows (ICAS).
  9.9.3. Grass Fire Hazard Mitigation. Pyrotechnics will only be used on board demonstration
  aircraft. If permitted, consider the following. There is significant potential for an unplanned
  grass fire when pyrotechnics are used in conjunction with open house demonstrations.
  Several methods of mitigation are discussed below. Ultimately there is no one-size-fits-all
  solution to the pyrotechnic display fire hazard, and all effects (both immediate and delayed)
  must be considered in selecting the appropriate mitigation option(s). Whatever other
  method(s) are used to mitigate the fire hazard, plan to have the fire department standing by at
  a safe distance near any pyrotechnic demonstration to quickly respond to any resulting fire.
     9.9.3.1. Mowing. The standard height for grass on airfields is 7-14 inches. The purpose
     of this standard is to minimize the threat to aircraft from birds and other wildlife. The
     greatest fire threat during a pyrotechnic expenditure is from any dried thatch left over
     from previous mowing. Plan the mowing schedule for the pyrotechnics area to provide a
     well-maintained length and to limit the accumulation of dried thatch prior to the open
     house. Local vegetation and environmental conditions will dictate the best mowing
     schedule. In every case, any dried thatch should be removed from the pyrotechnic area(s)
     prior to the open house.
     9.9.3.2. Pre-Burning, Pre-Soaking, and Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH)
     Considerations. Many purveyors of pyrotechnic displays advocate pre-burning the area
     to prevent grass fires in the aftermath of the display; however, this decision cannot be
     made in a void. Any portion of the airfield that is burned, either in preparation for, or
     following the expenditure of the pyrotechnics will serve to attract birds and negatively
     affect the airfield‘s BASH efforts. The larger the burned area, the greater the negative
     effect.
         9.9.3.2.1. From a BASH perspective, pre-soaking would be preferable to pre-
         burning, provided it is not over-done resulting in standing water, as this would also
         attract birds. Field conditions, access in/around the pyrotechnic area, as well as
         contractor access requirements prior to the pyrotechnic expenditure may render this
         option impractical. Early planning and coordination with affected parties is key.
         9.9.3.2.2. Pre-burning the pyrotechnic area is a viable option in many cases, but
         should only be pursued after careful consideration. All pre-burning will adversely
         affect the BASH threat at the airfield. If done correctly, the increased BASH threat
         will diminish over the couple of weeks following the open house. If done incorrectly,
48                                                           482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009


          the grass will not re-grow for an extended period of time, which is unacceptable from
          a BASH perspective. Examples of incorrect burning would be to burn too late in the
          year when the grass has already gone dormant or, in the case of drier vegetation,
          burning in a manner which damages the roots (i.e. too hot). Dormancy can begin as
          early as late summer in some locations. All locations, vegetation, and climates vary,
          so be sure to consider all implications before implementing a pre-burn plan.
          Coordinate with the base Civil Engineering office on the timing and effective
          methods for a controlled burn. Additionally, local laws/regulations may require the
          procurement of a burn permit.
          9.9.3.2.3. If pre-burning is to be pursued, work with the contractor/demonstrator to
          limit the affected area to the smallest area practical. Being conservative in the size,
          intensity, and footprint of the pyrotechnic display can limit the size of the affected
          area and the size of the resultant attraction to the bird population.

                                           Chapter 10

                                    FORCE PROTECTION

10.1. Overview. The installation commander will use the contents of this chapter as a guide for
planning force protection prior to and during events. The safety of Air Force personnel and the
protection of Air Force aircraft and other resources is paramount. Force protection measures
should always be taken into consideration, whether participating in flyovers, aerial
demonstrations, aerial reviews, or conducting static displays. It is imperative all Air Force
members at all levels consider the situation and potential threat to Air Force personnel, aircraft,
and resources when deciding to participate in or host any military or civilian event. Refer to
AFMAN 31-201, Volume 3, Flight Operations, AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security
Program, Air Force Join Instructions (AFJI) 31-102, Physical Security Program and AFI 10-
245, for force protection considerations, to be reviewed for applicability prior to planning a base
open house.
10.2. Force Protection Planning. Develop or update the Installation Security Plan (ISP) at
least 6 months prior to an open house. The plan should follow current Air Force planning
guidance and have all necessary annexes. Proper planning gives the installation commander a
true picture of equipment and personnel requirements to offset vulnerabilities. Use MAJCOM
staffs and any other available Air Force assets as necessary to assist in planning. The plan must
be protected in accordance with identified vulnerabilities. As a minimum, the plan should be For
Official Use Only (FOUO) or classified if appropriate.
10.3. Length of Open House. Wings Over Homestead will be a two day event with up to two
additional practice days preceding the event.
10.4. Vulnerability Assessments. Wing Anti-Terrorism Officer (ATO) will conduct a
vulnerability assessment at least 6 months prior to an open house and again within 30 days of the
event. Searches for vulnerabilities must be conducted inside and outside the installation. Use all
assets available to conduct assessments on and off base to identify vulnerabilities.
Bioenvironmental Engineering and Public Health should be consulted to conduct vulnerabilities
of water and food sources respectively. Planners should refer to vulnerabilities already identified
in the Vulnerability Assessment Management Program (VAMP) as the baseline for conducting
this assessment. In addition to the VAMP, planners must ensure they continue to evaluate
current threat information.
   10.4.1. Air Force Office of Special Investigation (OSI). Use local Air Force OSI resources
   to address and obtain counter surveillance and counter intelligence operations and
   information as Necessary. In addition, having OSI work with local state and federal agencies
   to ensure ground intelligence is presented to Force Protection Working Group (FPWG) as
   well as work with civil law enforcement agencies for Open House assistance.
   10.4.2. Civil Authorities. Use of civil authorities (Miami Dade Police Department, Miami
   Dade Fire Department, Homestead Police Department and Florida Highway Patrol) will give
   the installation a fresh view. The more vantage points used, the better the installation can
   identify vulnerabilities. Use all assets available to assess on and off-installation topography
   (helicopter views or assessments if possible). Consider use of off-base patrols in conjunction
   with civil authorities to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities and cover the surface-to-air
52                                                                482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009


     missile footprint. Ensure the Judge Advocate is involved in jurisdictional issues and Posse
     Comitatus Act concerns. If an installation has a waterway as a boundary, consider
     establishing an exclusionary zone.
10.5. Integrated Base Defense (IBD). IBD doctrine and methodology, when properly applied,
allows installation commanders and security forces to harness the entire base population and
technology to see first, understand first, and act first. Use the following IBD mission affects
areas during the planning process.
     10.5.1. Operations Security. Operations Security maximizes options. Obviously publicity
     (open/close times, aircraft on display, etc.) is necessary, but don‘t give the operational plan to
     the public. Only share your plan with personnel who have a need-to-know, and only share
     the amount of information they need to perform their particular function.
     10.5.2. Deter. Make consequences clear and discourage potential enemies. Public Affairs
     should advertise certain security measures such as search stations for hand carried items and
     restrictions of large bags, coolers, etc. to facilitate a smoother transition on to the installation.
     Ensure all personnel working the event are in uniform; encourage military personnel
     attending the event to wear a uniform. Note: The wear of uniforms for some security forces
     personnel may detract from their assigned protection mission. The installation‘s chief of
     security forces (CSF) may locally determine what security forces personnel will be in civilian
     attire.
     10.5.3. Anticipate. Anticipate what an adversary may do to disrupt operations or create
     mass casualties. Plans for disruptions and mass casualties should be practiced and rehearsed.
     10.5.4. Deny. Consider limiting or prohibiting large hand carried items such as coolers,
     backpacks, handbags to reduce the chance of introduction of unauthorized weapons,
     explosives, etc. Deny access to ―off-limits‖ portions of the installation using barriers and
     effective traffic management. Route and park vehicles an adequate distance from critical
     installation resources and the event site (where spectators are massed) to provide adequate
     standoff distance in the event of the use of a vehicle borne improvised explosive device.
     This action is crucial to limiting mass casualties at the event site.
     10.5.5. Detect. See all potential threats first. Purses, diaper bags, etc., will need to be
     brought into the event site area, so inspection stations at event areas are encouraged in order
     to detect any unauthorized items. If magnetometers are available, use them at the inspection
     stations as needed. Non-government vehicles that will be driven or parked in close proximity
     to public access area, to include delivery vehicles, must be inspected before entry. Consider
     walking explosive detection dogs through parking lots. Ensure all critical facilities are
     manned with unit personnel in order to detect unauthorized access or suspicious activity.
     10.5.6. Delay. Layer security to prevent the use of space as a means of adversary attack.
     Distributing forces throughout the base increases detection, response, and continuity of
     forces needed to neutralize potential threats. Consider the use of barriers or obstacles to
     channel crowds and provide delaying capabilities.
     10.5.7. Assess. Analyze the effect of layered defenses and the emergency response plans.
     This leverages intelligence and enables defending forces to influence an adversary‘s
     decision-making and course of action cycles.
482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009                                                                      53


   10.5.8. Deploy. Pre-positioning of disaster response capabilities gives the installation instant
   response. Maintain the capability to deploy with advantage to any incident. Ensure the
   Emergency Operations Center and emergency response forces are on base and able to deploy
   to any situation. The Security Forces Security Response Team (SRT) will be formed and on
   standby inside Bldg 101 for use in response to high-risk incidents. This team will work in
   conjunction with Miami-Dade Police Department (MDPDs) Special Weapons and Tactics
   (SWAT) team. In addition, Security Forces observer teams will be posted in the Air Traffic
   Control Tower.
   10.5.9. Neutralize. Posted security forces, civilian police, and the SRT will be in place and
   ready to neutralize any threat. These personnel should be able to render the enemy
   ineffective if they should decide to strike during the event. These forces are capable of
   neutralizing hostile threats with lethal and nonlethal force, acting on criminal activities, and
   capable of controlling crowds.
   10.5.10. Mitigate. Evacuation plans and notifications will be in place to allow spectators an
   escape route for any emergency. Emergency response (police, fire and medical) capabilities
   will be available for mass casualty response if necessary. This minimizes the effect of
   adversary successes and takes the advantage away from the enemy.
10.6. FPWG. The FPWG is a multi-discipline group designed to assess threat information and
make timely recommendations to the installation commander on security matters. It‘s the
installation commander‘s tool to ensure maintenance of a safe and secure environment. Further,
the FPWG should meet regularly and as close as possible to the start of an event to provide
information and/or make recommendations to the installation commander concerning possible
threats, adversary actions, and actions for IBD. In addition, the FPWG is a key instrument in
security policy development prior to and during events. Note: Ensure the Air Boss is brought
into planning stages of FPWG and provides names of Air Show participants for proper security
screening.
   10.6.1. Threat Working Group (TWG). Continuous updates from ATO, OSI, local, state,
   and federal law enforcement agencies are necessary for a successful event. The TWG
   receives these updates and can provide the FPWG and installation commander with all
   intelligence data relevant to the installation and static display aircraft.
   10.6.2. Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI)/ATO. AFOSI/ATO should work
   closely with all local, state, and federal agencies to ensure ground intelligence is presented to
   the FPWG. This action gives the installation intelligence continuous updates on the threat.
10.7. Manpower for Force Protection Requirements. There must be enough manpower
available to ensure a safe and secure environment during the event. All base personnel are part
of the integrated base security team and used as part of the force protection capability. The
installation commander should consider activating the security forces augmentation duty
program personnel to provide an additional presence and enhance response capabilities. The
CSF must ensure they know what to look for and what the current threat picture is for the
installation. They should be briefed in mass on what to look for and how to report suspicious
personnel and activities. Also, brief the current local and national threat as appropriate.
   10.7.1. Military and Civilian Employees. All military personnel and base civilian employees
   should be considered part of the security and safety team. These personnel should be
54                                                             482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009


     directed to work in accordance with the installation commander‘s directives. Enough active
     duty military personnel should be on duty to meet all manpower and contingency
     requirements. Civilians will be used at the installation commander‘s discretion. Ensure
     enough personnel are available and on-duty to conduct post and meal relief for the duration
     of the event.
10.8. Installation Entry and Circulation Control Procedures. During the air show, the entire
installation will be secured by creating sterile corridors and ingress/egress points for non-base
personnel, handicapped, VIPs, and performers. Visitors will only be allowed access to the areas
of the installation intended for the event.
     10.8.1. Parking.
        10.8.1.1. Force protection concerns will dictate the appropriate parking and
        transportation plan for the air show. The plan will be developed by security forces and
        approved by the wing commander.
        10.8.1.2. Homestead employees and assigned reservists who wish to park on base will be
        allowed to enter the installation and park in their work center parking areas. These
        personnel will be instructed to enter the installation prior to 0900 hrs each day.
        10.8.1.3. A bus stop will be located at SW 127th Avenue and SW 285th Street. This bus
        stop is for all guests who do not desire to utilize the pedestrian route to the air show
        area.All passengers will be screened by SF, or SF augmentees, prior to boarding the
        buses. This screening area will be monitored by SF and MDPD personnel. The buses
        will travel a continuous circuitous route: SW 127 Av to SW 285 St, enter the flight line
        and drop off passengers. Passengers will be allowed to board and the buses will continue
        on the exit route: SW 122 Ave to SW 127 Av. Sentries will be posted at all open flight
        line gates. One SF augmentee will be aboard each bus to ensure the driver does not
        deviate from the route and does not stop and pick up passengers along the route.
        10.8.1.4. The general public will be encouraged to utilize the pedestrian route. The
        pedestrians will be screened at the Coral Sea Gate by SF/or SF augmentees. This
        screening area will be monitored by SF and MDPD personnel. The pedestrian route will
        be delineated by ―snow fencing‖ and will be monitored by posted/roving SF personnel.
        The route will begin at Coral Sea Gate, continue down Coral Sea Blvd turn left onto St
        Lo Blvd, turn right onto Turner St, turn left onto Tuskegee Blvd and finally right onto
        Timor Rd (through the USCG Compound). A pedestrian Entry Control Point (ECP) will
        be opened to the Air Show Box and will be monitored by SF personnel.
     10.8.2. Crowd Control. AFOSI is a non-uniformed law enforcement agency that could be
     used along with the ATO to monitor the spectators, and report suspicious personnel or
     activities to security forces personnel. In addition, the CSF will place trained security forces
     personnel in civilian attire to complement and augment this mission. Although not normally
     a problem at such events, riot control requirements should be considered. Post observers to
     monitor the crowd and key points. Observers should utilize binoculars, cameras and
     recorders to detect and report suspicious personnel and activities to the security forces
     control center using available communication systems.
        10.8.2.1. In conjunction with JA, security forces should plan for the disposition of
        dissidents or protestors. Protected First Amendment speech does not extend to
482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009                                                                     55


       expressions that present a clear danger to loyalty, discipline, and morale of service
       members or interfere with mission accomplishment. This means political and dissident
       activities, rallies, etc. not approved by the installation commander, or other activities
       involving demonstrations or public activism, are not permitted on the installation during
       an open house.
       10.8.2.2. Security forces should escort offenders to a pre-established holding area or turn
       them over to civil authorities and bar offenders from the installation. As a minimum, a
       process will be established with local law enforcement agencies to rapidly process
       offenders in accordance with jurisdiction agreements.
   10.8.3. Traffic Control. The cable barrier system along Tuskegee Blvd will be raised to limit
   access to the flightline during the Air Show. The emergency vehicle route from the Air
   Show box will be Coral Sea Blvd to Tuskegee Blvd to the Westover Gate. Traffic control off
   base and on the turnpike will be conducted and controlled by MDPD, Homestead Police
   Department (HPD) and Florida Highway Patrol (FHP).
   10.8.4. Vendor Access. Authorized vendors (e.g. food concessionaires) will require access
   to the installation and event site to set up displays, and each vendor must be identified prior
   to allowing entry. The names/identification of all vendors will be provided to security forces
   at least 72 hours prior to the air show. This will allow security forces time to run the names
   through National Criminal Investigation Center/Federal Criminal Investigation Center
   (NCIC/FCIC) to determine suitability for entrance. Vendors will be issued ―Vendor‖ vehicle
   placards and a vendor Entry Authorization List (EAL) will be posted at the Westover Gate.
   Vendor will enter through the Westover Gate and be directed to the air show box area once
   their names are confirmed on the EAL and their cargo is inspected.
10.9. Aircraft Security. As soon as the number and type of aircraft that will be on static
display is determined, identify security requirements for the aircraft attending. Note: Planners
should consolidate like protection level aircraft in one large restricted area until configured for
static display just prior to the event. Some aircraft will require armed security forces and
temporary restricted areas. Temporary restricted areas will have to be established for some
aircraft while this won‘t be necessary for other aircraft. Ensure there are enough security forces
for aircraft security, and enough ropes and stanchions to establish temporary restricted areas as
required IAW AFI 31-101 and AFJI 31-102. Aircraft commanders are responsible for ensuring
uniformed aircrew members are present at the aircraft to answer questions and assist with
security during the event.
10.10. Dignitary Support. Distinguished Visitors (DV) will be identified by the PA office.
Each DV will be issued a ―DV‖ vehicle placard and a DV EAL will be posted at the Westover
Gate. DVs will enter the Westover Gate and upon verification via the EAL will be directed to
the DV parking area (adjacent to Bldg 596).
10.11. Emergency Response. All emergency response actions should be planned and if
possible, rehearsed prior to the event. The Emergency Operations Center, explosive ordnance
disposal, security forces, medical, and fire department personnel should be on base and have a
pre-determined rally point to respond to any emergency during the event. Ensure evacuation
plans are exercised as prior to the event. Additionally, consider conducting a mass
casualty/terrorist exercise in conjunction with local authorities. The exercise can be combined
with the MARE recommended in para. 9.6.3.1. and required by AFI 10-2501.
56                                                        482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009


10.12. Communications. The Law Enforcement Desk (LED) located at Bldg 353 will continue
to operate normally. A separate control center will be established for air show operations and
will be staffed with SF, MDPD, HPD, and FHP representatives. Day to day, normal activities
will be controlled by the LED; all air show operations will be controlled by the LE Air show
Command Post. Communications in time of emergency are essential. Proper communications
can ensure a potential threat is neutralized prior to the threat affecting the event.
Communications should be available and emergency response personnel should be linked to
ensure proper command and control. Security forces, OSI, local civil authorities, and emergency
response elements should be able to talk to each other directly or through a combined command
communications center.

                                          Chapter 11

                                PUBLIC AFFAIRS SUPPORT

11.1. Introduction. The Air Force conducts comprehensive, active public affairs programs at
all levels of command to provide Airmen, the public, Congress and the media information that
contributes to awareness and understanding of the Air Force mission. Community relations
programs like open houses are designed to enhance the 482 FW as well as the Air Force‘s
reputation as a good neighbor as well as highlight the attributes of a respected, professional Air
Force charged with protecting U.S. national security.
11.2. Responsibilities. Public Affairs support to the open house program involves:
   11.2.1. Providing advice and guidance to the Open House Director and installation
   commander.
   11.2.2. Ensuring the internal audience is kept well informed of the event.
   11.2.3. Working with local media to maximize exposure of the event.
   11.2.4. Ensuring the base displays good stewardship to the local community. Public Affairs
   should also be prepared to offer guidance and respond quickly in the event of an accident or
   other emergency. AFI 35-101, Chapter 7, Crisis Communication, has specific guidance for
   emergency situations. The Public Affairs checklist in Attachment 2 provides additional
   guidance on public affairs activities at an open house.
11.3. Community Relations. An open house is considered a community relations event. There
are several specific areas of concern that should be addressed during the planning process. These
include: providing an open house exhibit; coordinating points of contact with community groups
and government agencies, industry representatives, and other MAJCOMs for potential ground
displays; coordination with protocol in ensuring key civic leaders are invited to distinguished
visitor receptions and the event DV viewing area; developing a plan to reach out to community
groups and businesses to aid in the publicity of the event; and scheduling performers for key
recruiting and goodwill visits to local schools and hospitals.
   11.3.1. Protocol usually is the lead agency in planning key DV receptions and arrangements
   for the commander‘s viewing area during the show. However, it is important to ensure PA
   remains actively engaged. At many locations, the local Chamber of Commerce Military
   Affairs Committee will be interested in sponsoring a reception for key event performers and
   other invited guests. When this happens, PA will be a major contributor to open house
   committee planning and execution of the event.
   11.3.2. Many open house plans lend themselves to having a practice show the day before the
   base is open to the general public. This show allows the base to invite members of the
   general public who have special needs and may not be able to attend the show in a large
   crowd. Open House Staffs should consider extending invitations to special needs schools,
   senior citizen homes, ―make-a-wish‖ children, or other groups in the local area. Having
   fewer people on the flight line will allow these guests to be dropped off within a short
   distance of the seating. When inviting special needs people, be sure to provide seating that is
   handicapped accessible in close proximity to bathroom facilities, a covered area to escape the
   heat, and plenty of water. Groups should be encouraged to bring their own snacks.
58                                                           482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009


11.4. Internal Information. The base residents and work force must be kept informed of open
house activities and plans. Use all available tools including the base Web page commander‘s
access channel and e-mail to ensure personnel are kept aware of road closures and security
concerns, as well as the particulars of the event. Residents and employees can also assist in
publicizing the show. In addition to base event information on road closures, a map of the flight
line, a listing of ―do‘s and don‘ts‖, security requirements, and human-interest stories and
activities pertaining to the base internal population should be included on the base Web site.
11.5. Inserts and Programs. Public Affairs does not have a contract for a base newspaper. PA
may produce in-house a program for distribution to the public if it is deemed necessary for the
event. Services Marketing may choose to develop a souvenir program to be sold that contains
elements of the air show. A schedule should be limited to only the MWR elements of the air
show unless the souvenir program is made available for free to the general public. Schedules
may be printed on large boards and placed at key locations, or printed on smaller sheets of paper.
More paper generates more debris.
11.6. Media Relations. The open house gives the Air Force an opportunity to make a favorable
and lasting impression on the thousands of people who attend. Engaging the local media,
however, provides an opportunity to reach many thousands, or even millions more, who learn
about the Air Force from the newspapers, magazines, Internet, radio and television. Public
Affairs should devise a marketing strategy and publicize the event through all available media.
Publicity opportunities can also include interaction with the local Chamber of Commerce,
tourism board, and industry forums in the region.
     11.6.1. Public Affairs professionals should use all means available to get the best exposure
     possible and to achieve the widest publicity. The news release is the most common way to
     deliver information to the media. Stories published on base Web site also serve the same
     purpose as news releases, and news media outlets are welcome to use articles on the Web site
     for publication. Releases may announce news or answer anticipated queries. The news
     release varies in length, but most often is a page of newsworthy information. Invite the
     media to cover the event, as they are more apt to use the story if they invest time in its
     development. Also, provide available photographs, video, and graphics with the story.
     Products should meet requirements of the intended media. The following list is not meant to
     be inclusive, but provides some additional ideas on how to publicize the event. Publicity can
     be gained through many different means: arrange media flights before and during the event;
     work with Visual Information to create posters/flyers; purchase paid advertising or arrange
     radio and television station public service announcements (PSAs).
        11.6.1.1. Use an accomplished spokesperson to reach out to local media programming,
        community groups and schools.
        11.6.1.2. Develop an open house Web site – www.wingsoverhomestead.com - and
        hotline number (305) 224-SHOW (7469).
        11.6.1.3. Send out a list of interview ideas and ―fun facts‖ about the show or base; devise
        a list of potential interview subjects, include hometown Airmen returning home to be part
        of the event; pitch ideas personally to media representatives.
        11.6.1.4. Assist Homestead Services in creating a souvenir program.
482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009                                                                    59


       11.6.1.5. Send out comprehensive press kits to include radio messages, and stock
       photos/video; provide background information and key Air Force messages to the
       narrator to maximize education during the show and encourage participation in the next
       open house; and remain alert/attend meetings to ensure you know what‘s happening when
       and be prepared with a list of story ideas.
   11.6.2. An important aspect of media relations is taking care of the media while they are on
   base. While the open house is ‗open‘ to all, recommend providing the media with access
   badges; arranging for a centrally located media center with amenities; providing media
   risers/lifts; arranging special parking and/or providing options for loading/unloading of
   equipment; and providing transportation around the flight line or base to facilitate interviews
   and stories. Ensure a suitable number of Public Affairs representatives are available to work
   with the media, facilitate interviews, and answer questions.
   11.6.3. Generally, credentials for media are only required if the media is being provide
   special access. Public Affairs personnel should give great care to ensure they are
   credentialing bona fide media representatives, freelance writers, photographers and
   videographers. If the media badges allow access to areas closed to the general public, a
   Public Affairs representative should remain with the media at all times when they are in a
   restricted/closed area. Coordinate media badging procedures and access with Security Forces
   prior to the event.
11.7. Demonstration Team Requests. Aerial demonstrations for open houses are requested
with a completed DD Form 2535, Request for Military Aerial Support, from the Open House
Director to MAJCOM/PA. Requests for performances must be received by SAF/PAN no later
than 1 August to be considered for the following calendar year‘s schedule.
   11.7.1. Non-Air Force Requests. Requests for the Navy‘s Blue Angels and the Army‘s
   Golden Knights are submitted to the U.S. Navy and U.S. Army Public Affairs offices
   indicated on page 4 of DD Form 2535. Requests for the Canadian Forces‘ Snowbirds are
   submitted to the 431st Air Demonstration Squadron, PO Box 5000, Moose Jaw, SK S6H
   7Z8. For more information and copy of the request form, visit the team‘s website
   http://www.snowbirds.dnd.ca
   11.7.2. Cancellations. A unit canceling a performance by the Thunderbirds at its base must
   immediately send a message listing the date the performance was scheduled, place, reason
   for cancellation, and person canceling performance (with phone number and affiliation, if
   possible, for civilian site). The cancellation notice should be routed through Public Affairs
   channels to the appropriate headquarters with the following as information addressees:
   SAF/PAN, Headquarters (HQ) USAF/XOO, and ACC/PA/DO.
11.8. Recruiting Involvement. Personnel from the local recruiting squadron should be present
at the open house to capitalize on the gathering of so many people with positive attitudes towards
the military. Recruiting normally has interesting displays, simulators, etc. to inform the public
on Air Force life.

11.9. Adopted Forms.

                               PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS

A2.1. General Planning. The following suggestions are intended to support the overall
planning of the event, however, they may not include every action to be considered by the Open
House Staff.
A2.1.1. Long-term Planning.
        A2.1.1.1. Determine a date(s) for the event. Consider events being held in the local
        community, historical significance, and availability of guests. Consider backup dates for
        demonstration team availability. Determine whether the event is one day or multiple
        days.
        A2.1.1.2. Determine start and end times for the event. Most events start in late morning
        and finish mid-to-late afternoon.
        A2.1.1.3. Determine exhibit locations. Can exhibits be located, both on base and in the
        community?
        A2.1.1.4. Determine off-limits/restricted areas.
        A2.1.1.5. Determine whether your facility has the capacity for the expected crowd.
        A2.1.1.6. Clear your event with Numbered AF, MAJCOM, and Headquarters (HQ)
        USAF as required.
        A2.1.1.7. Appoint staff and committees to hand open house functions.              Ensure
        committee assignments are explicit and inclusive.
        A2.1.1.8. Ensure recruiters been brought into the planning.
        A2.1.1.9. Obtain good airport or site layout diagram.
     A2.1.2. Event Planning
        A2.1.2.1. Coordinate with airfield management and have regular meetings to keep them
        abreast of developments and requirements.
        A2.1.2.2. Arrange for construction and electrical permit if needed.
        A2.1.2.3. Arrange for necessary barricades, snow fencing, ropes, stanchions and other
        crowd-control devices to be purchased, leased or borrowed, delivered and installed in a
        timely manner.
        A2.1.2.4. Work with appropriate chairmen to determine locations of all static displays
        and provide for necessary security and crowd control.
        A2.1.2.5. Work with concession chairman to establish a plan for the location of
        concession booths. Make sure required electrical power is available where and when
        needed.
        A2.1.2.6. Military aircraft, tanks, and other weapons displays often have unusual weight
        requirements. Coordinate with airport management to use appropriate ramps and access
        roads.

     implement a solution for providing drinking water that is acceptable to the local health
     department to pipe or transport sufficient quantities of water to the air show site. If
     possible, arrange for stand-by sprinklers for spectator cool-down in the event of
     extremely hot weather.
     A2.1.2.10. Arrange for conveniently located trashcans for spectators‘ use. Ample
     numbers will greatly lessen post-show clean up. Prompt and thorough cleaning of the
     site will leave a good impression on the public.
     A2.1.2.11. Arrange for emptying of trash barrels throughout the day and for trash
     removal from the site at the end of each day of use.

A2.2 Public Affairs
   A2.2.1. Show Publicity. A strong public affairs effort can often provide the most cost-
   effective tool for ensuring the general public knows about your open house. But cost-
   effective and easy are not always the same thing. What you save in money, you may more
   than make up for in phone calls, shoe leather and lots and lots of planning. Use all the free
   media you can get.
       A2.2.1.1. CONSIDERATIONS
           A2.2.1.1.1. Prepare periodic news releases and provide to news and program
           departments of local/regional radio, TV and newspapers.
           A2.2.1.1.2. Ensure all pre-event publicity explains security and parking procedures,
           as well as what items guests will be allowed to bring on the installation (i.e. coolers,
           chairs, bicycles, roller blades, baby strollers, etc.)
           A2.2.1.1.3. Learn who on the news staff of each local medium will be assigned to
           cover your air show and begin working with that individual on a regular, relationship-
           building basis. Send personal invitations to them to attend the open house.
           A2.2.1.1.4. Advise all media and assist in preparation of special story opportunities.
           Negotiate ―exclusives‖ as appropriate.
86                                                    482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009


     A2.2.1.1.5. Consider holding a press conference a week before the event. Schedule
     interviews with Base Commander and Open House committee director.
     A2.2.1.1.6. Invite the media to your practice/dry run to encourage good coverage on
     the eve of the event.
     A2.2.1.1.7. Work early with area magazines on cover and story ideas that promote
     your event.
     A2.2.1.1.8. Notify all calendars of events in magazines and trade publications of
     dates/location at least six months in advance of your event. Update regularly.
     A2.2.1.1.9. Work with local radio and television stations to determine how much
     time will be allotted for public service announcements promoting the open house.
     Submit public service announcement (PSA) copy to all media, tailored to their
     particular format and audience.
     A2.2.1.1.10. Prepare PSAs and spot announcements; can be done in conjunction with
     base VI assets or through a local TV/radio station; consider inviting a local celebrity
     or sports figure to ride with the Thunderbirds or other military aircraft, use the
     footage obtained to create PSAs for the next show.
     A2.2.1.1.11. Create story ideas that could have national network interest; ensure
     proper network clearances are obtained, and pitch stories that will lend themselves to
     on-the-spot broadcasts before and during the event.
     A2.2.1.1.12. Invite out-of-town stations to cover the event.
     A2.2.1.1.13. Consider working with local television stations to prepare a one-hour
     show for primetime broadcasting in the local area; check with the program director
     for possible tie-ins with existing programs
     A2.2.1.1.14. Arrange for media previews and interviews on performers‘ arrival day,
     and invite media to attend the practice show.
     A2.2.1.1.15. Work with local TV and radio stations for a ‗remote‘ news and/or
     weather broadcast from the base a couple of days ahead of the open house. Arrange
     in advance for media flights, generally available from the military teams and from
     some civilian performers. Read military support manuals for criteria and determine
     the event‘s policy and insurance coverage before publishing or scheduling media
     flights. ACC teams cannot perform media flights.
     A2.2.1.1.16. Arrange for media flights and on-site interviews well in advance of
     performer arrivals. Provide performers with interview and ride schedule upon arrival.
     A2.2.1.1.17. Arrange in advance for media coverage of performer visits to hospitals,
     schools, nursing homes, etc.
     A2.2.1.1.18. Obtain current performer media kits.
     A2.2.1.1.19. Provide information packets on performers and participants to media,
     both before and during the events. Include stock photographs and video clips, and
     current radio releases and messages.
482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009                                                                 87


        A2.2.1.1.20. Consider informing the media about distinguished visitors (DV) who
        are attending the event; determine if DVs are available for interviews.
        A2.2.1.1.21. Coordinate media presence at dinners/banquets/social hours for
        performers, DVs and air show personnel when appropriate.
        A2.2.1.1.22. Inform trade and industrial editors whose products or equipment might
        be used or displayed.
        A2.2.1.1.23. Ensure base newspaper has current event information, performer
        information and schedules. Should provide consistent coverage at least one month out
        through the event. A final schedule should be published in the newspaper prior to the
        event.
        A2.2.1.1.24. Develop a list of ―key‖ local media and fax them story ideas, ―fun
        facts,‖ and last minute information the week before the show to encourage additional
        editorial coverage for the show.
        A2.2.1.1.25. Coordinate a plan to handle media inquiries in the event of an incident
        or accident with event leadership. Brief media on the rules of engagement in the
        event of an accident.
        A2.2.1.1.26. Develop an information website and telephone hotline for general
        public who desire more information about performers, schedules, parking, inclement
        weather plans, and what they can and cannot bring to the open house.
        A2.2.1.1.27. Work with hospitality staff to develop information packet for
        performers, to include such items as maps of the area, accommodation arrangements,
        transportation plans, schedules, parties, local points of interest, scenic and historic
        sites and scheduled performer briefings. Consider asking the local Chamber of
        Commerce for assistance.

  house. In large measure, attendance will depend directly on the effectiveness of your
  marketing efforts.
     A2.2.2.1. CONSIDERATIONS

            movie theaters.
     A2.2.3. Media Accommodations on Site. Prior to your event, if you‘ve had an active and
     effective public relations program, you gave a great deal of time and attention to the media
     for pre-event promotion and publicity. At the open house itself, it‘s time to pay attention to
     the media‘s needs in covering the event they helped promote. Event coverage can bring
     people from their homes to the show site. Post-event publicity tells people what they missed
     and encourages attendance the next year.

             A2.2.3.1.5.9. Airport layout and show site diagrams
             A2.2.3.1.5.10. Media platform, particularly for video and photo journalists (i.e.
             scissor lift) – ensure no parked aircraft with their viewing
             A2.2.3.1.5.11. Interview area
             A2.2.3.1.5.12. Written procedures for an emergency situation
             A2.2.3.1.5.13. Clear instructions as to where the media may and may not go.
             Volunteer personnel to ensure that only media and other authorized personnel
             enter the area. This is a center for the working media, and not a viewing area for
             families and children.

         able to unload and load their equipment.
         A2.2.3.1.12. Provide copies of the open house program to the media in advance or
         during the credentialing process.
         A2.2.3.1.13. Provide refreshments for the media if possible.
  A2.2.4. Open House Program. Nearly all open houses produce some type of souvenir
  program. They are usually sold as souvenirs and are funded by the sale of advertising to
  local business. They contain photos and articles about featured military and civilian
  performers and aircraft, and information about and/or diagrams showing the locations of
  important facilities and spectator services. It may contain a schedule of the Services‘
  provided activities held during the open house. Base Public Affairs offices must check their
90                                                            482FWI11-201 5 OCTOBER 2009


     local newspaper contract to determine if the publisher has sole rights to develop an air show
     program. If this is the case, a second program for sale will not be accomplished. If the base
     newspaper contract does not address an air show insert, base Public Affairs coordinators
     should work with Services Marketing to develop a souvenir program to be sold during the
     event. In the event a program is sold, a free copy of the performance schedule must be
     available to the general public.
     A2.2.5. Photo Support. Photo coverage of your event is an important aspect of internal and
     external pre- and post-publicity. It also provides an historical record of the day‘s events. Be
     sure to work with base Visual Information to ensure the event is covered adequately.
        A2.2.5.1. CONSIDERATIONS
            A2.2.5.1.1. Ensure sufficient photos are available for advance publicity. Archives
            from the previous open house, as well as performer publicity packages should be
            available.
            A2.2.5.1.2. Determine how photos can be used in pre-publicity displays, flyers,
            posters, etc.
            A2.2.5.1.3. Ensure photo lab assigns an adequate number of people to cover the

            in last minute press releases, etc.
     A2.2.6. Other Areas of Concern. Public Affairs personnel are involved in many aspects of
     the open house set-up. Although not appointed the overall project, open houses are Public
     Affairs events. Therefore, base Public Affairs officers should be involved in most of the
     decision-making process. Below is list of additional items base PAOs should also take into

            area.
            A2.2.6.1.3. Determine if tours of select locations on the base are feasible. The more

        A2.2.6.2. CONSIDERATIONS -- Civilian Demonstration Teams
            A2.2.6.2.1. Base Public Affairs coordinators should be part of the decision-making
            process on which civilian demonstrations occur during your event.

        obtain approval from MAJCOM public affairs offices.
        A2.2.6.2.4. Civilian demonstration teams must enhance the public‘s understanding of
        the Air Force and/or mission at your base.
        A2.2.6.2.5. First priority for flying time should be given to military assets, if these
        assets are not available, consider including civilian demonstrations.
     A2.2.6.3. CONSIDERATIONS -- Open House Related Events

        flightline, etc.)
        A2.2.6.3.2. Public affairs should publicize events, provide a list of community

Notes:
1     APF may be used to cover all costs for warbird appearances (those that would normally be
      associated with a services contract). Lodging, meals and transportation may be included as
      part of the contract or provided separately. May also be paid by outside organization (i.e..
      non-federal/private).
2     For safety of flight maintenance, installation commanders may designate work areas to be
      used by non-DoD personnel for repairing an aircraft, grant access to shop facilities, and if
      requested, permit assistance by qualified USAF maintenance personnel on a strictly
      volunteer basis.
3     Cannot be paid with APF or NAF. Cannot be arranged through commercial sponsorship
      program. Must be gift to AF or paid by outside organization (i.e.. non-federal/private)
4     Base may sell only enough DoD fuel to get the aircraft to the closest civil airfield
5     May be funded with APF, NAF or private funds depending on part of the show being
      supported. Essential elements (sanitation, health, safety, security, comfort of attendees
      etc.) are paid only with APF. Essential items are those that would be done even if there
      were no Services MWR participation. Items in support of Services MWR concessions or
      Services MWR provided entertainment can be supported with NAF or funds raised/donated
      by a private organization.
6     APF can be used but PA should maximize the use of free Public Service announcements.
      NAF can only be used for Services MWR elements of the event. Commercial ads
      promoting the open house can be paid for by sponsors (those same sponsors can be listed
      on the ad itself) and off-base establishments that serve as sponsors can acknowledge their
      support in their own promotional endeavors prior to the actual event.
7     Event Guides (i.e. schedule of events) are APF funded. NAF dollars can be used to print
      programs for Services/MWR events occurring at the open house (I.e. concert). Open house
      souvenir programs can be NAF if the base newspaper contractor does not have the rights.
      These may contain paid advertisements to cover the costs of printing. Public Affairs must
      provide a free ‗schedule of events‘ when souvenir programs/event guides are NAF.
8     APF supported public base Web site can be used to provide open house information. An
      outside organization (i.e. non-federal/private) may establish a web site to promote the
      event. The site must clearly state that it is not an official Air Force website.
9     The impression must be that the event is conducted in an orderly manner by the United
      States military. Inappropriate signage would be extremely large or garish signs. Signs
      cannot block view of activities. Sponsor's name and logo displays are permitted but
      individual products cannot be sold.

10   DV functions ( i.e. commander's hospitality tent, as well as civic and social events
     occurring at the time of the open house) are a protocol activity and may be supported with
     Official Representation Funds(ORF) if in compliance with AFI 65-603. DV tent should be
     offset from the center of show area. The DV area is not sponsored nor can any sponsor
     signs be in the area.
11   Can be done at sponsor‘s expense. Must be physically separated from the commander's
     DV area in a location that does not detract from the public‘s ability to view air show
     performances. DV tents may not be sold. Signage must be minimal and within the tent
     area
12   TDY fund source depends on attendee. NAF employees use NAF and APF employees use
     APF
13   NAF can be used for event insurance for the Services MWR elements of the event.
14   Commercial sponsorship can only be used for the Services MWR elements of the event.
15   Liability insurance must be in-force for entertainment attractions, rides and fireworks.
16   Fees may be collected to offset the cost of contracting shuttle buses from off-base parking.
     These charges may not exceed an amount necessary to recover all associated expenses of
     providing the service. See paragraph 1.9.4.
