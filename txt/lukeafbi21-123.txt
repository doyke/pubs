      than 30 days and to depot, as required. An AF Form 614 will be filled out for each
      aircraft and placed where the jacket file is located. At no other time will the aircraft
      jacket file be sent with the aircraft unless permanently transferred or directed by the
      Maintenance Group Commander.
      1.2.2. If PS&D personnel deploy, they will maintain the aircraft jacket file for each
      aircraft, otherwise, the person that signs for it will be responsible.
2. Missing      IMTs   policy requirements: see missing forms                   letter   located
at \\luke\dfs\56MXG\56_MOS\MXOOP\WORKING\Wing OI attachments.
3. Pre-dock meeting guidance:
   3.1. A pre-dock meeting must be accomplished prior to phase. Minimum attendance
   required are PS&D, Production Superintendent, Crew Chief, Aircraft Section Chief,
   Weapons Section Chief, Specialist Section Chief, Phase Super, Phase Dock Chief, Egress,
   EM, Fuels, and NDI (Note - Additional work centers involved in the maintenance of the
   aircraft will be added to the AF Form 2410, Inspection/TCTO Planning Checklist, as
   required).
   3.2. PS&D will chair the pre-dock and annotate all discussions on the AF Form 2410 located
   at \\luke\dfs\\56MXG\56_MOS\MXOOP\WORKING\Wing OI attachments.                         All
   maintenance such as TCTO, Time Change Items (TCI), Special Inspections (SI), and
   Delayed Discrepancies (DD) overdue/due must be annotated on the form.
   3.3. PS&D will schedule all maintenance in IMDS (excluding DD) and annotate the (Job
   Control Numbers (JCN) on the AF Form 2410 prior to the pre-dock meeting. PS&D will
   maintain the original AF Form 2410 as a suspense item to be used as a guide when
   conducting the post-dock meeting. A copy is given to the dock chief.
   3.4. PS&D will process and print screen 942, Actual Configuration Set-up Report and 990,
   Actual Configuration Tracked Item Inquiry, in IMDS using the aircraft tail number entering
   phase. PS&D will highlight all items identified as out-of-configuration on both products and
 4                                                       LUKEAFBI21-123 13 OCTOBER 2011


     will be given to the phase dock chief at the pre-dock meeting for verification during the
     phase inspection. A JCN for out of configuration items will be annotated on the AF Form
     2410. If there are no out of configuration items, the 942 will be filed until the next phase. If
     corrections are required, PS&D will print a new 942/990 and verify the changes have been
     made. Once verified, it will be filed along with the original report. If corrections have not
     been made, they will be annotated and briefed to the Production Superintendent until the
     corrections are made.
     3.5. PS&D will ensure pre-dock package contains at a minimum the following for the pre-
     dock meeting: AF Form 2410 with all required fields filled out, part/serial number
     verification sheets, and printed 942/990.
4. Post-dock meeting guidance:
     4.1. A Post-Dock meeting must be accomplished when the phase inspection has been
     completed. PS&D will ensure all JCNs listed in the work package are closed out in IMDS
     prior to the post-dock meeting. Minimum attendance required are PS&D, Production
     Superintendent, Crew Chief, Aircraft Section Chief, Weapons Section Chief, Specialist
     Section Chief, Phase Super, and Phase Dock Chief. During this time, PS&D will need to
     ensure all required products (942, completed part/serial number verification sheets, gig
     sheets) are included in the package.     PS&D will print a screen 123 Maintenance Repair
     History Inquiry (using date range from first day of fuel barn until the last day of phase) out of
     IMDS to be filed in the phase package. Once everything is updated and completed (within 3
     days of post-dock), the package will be filed in the jacket file. The completed phase package
     will include the pre-dock and post-dock document reviews prior to filing.
5. Primary method of tracking:
     5.1. All SI, TCI, TCTO, and Aircraft Configuration Management programs will be managed
     using the Maintenance Scheduling Application Tool (MSAT).
     5.2. In the event MSAT or IMDS will be down more than 48 hours, download the files
     located    at   \\luke\dfs\56MXG\56_MOS\MXOOA_DBM\COMMON\PRODUCTS\PNS
     weekly. This folder will contain the most up to date files from IMDS prior to the system
     going down.
     5.3. Anytime there is a change that occurs in IMDS, manually update downloaded product
     with all changes using red “strike through” and add new information (example-if a time
     change item has been completed in IMDS, annotate the following on your product: new part
     number/serial number, date of installation, date of manufacture, lot number, new due date,
     and job standard (JST). “Strike through” the old item in red that was changed).
     5.4. Once the system is up, ensure all changes are updated in IMDS and verify new
     information is listed on the new product. Complete this by going line by line with the
     annotated product and new product.
6. TCTO Procedures:
     6.1. The following organizations will have a primary and alternate TCTO manager
     appointed and forward an appointment letter as follows:
        6.1.1. Primary TCTO managers are the focal point for overseeing TCTO
        accomplishment based on functional alignment. These include Engine Management
LUKEAFBI21-123 13 OCTOBER 2011                                                                5


     (EM), Munitions, Armament, Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL),
     and Maintenance Operations Squadron (MOS) PS&D. Appointment letters for primary
     managers will be forwarded to the 56 MXG Technical Order Distribution Office (TODO)
     and 56 MOS PS&D.
     6.1.2. Secondary TCTO managers are responsible to the primary manager overseeing
     their functional area. This includes Wing AFE, who reports to 56 MOS PS&D.
     6.1.3. Once an individual is assigned as the TCTO manager they will be required to
     attend TCTO manager training provided by Wing PS&D. A Wing PS&D representative
     will train each newly assigned manager and document the training on the appointment
     letter.
  6.2. Due to the centralization of schedulers, the Aircraft Maintenance Unit (AMU) PS&D
  Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC) will assist the Wing PS&D TCTO manager
  with overseeing aircraft TCTOs for their respective AMU. Each AMU PS&D section will
  monitor TCTOs for their unit by using the TCTO tracker. The template can be found at .
  6.3. Wing PS&D will establish and maintain TCTO folders for all aircraft, Aerospace
  Ground Equipment (AGE), Egress, and commodity TCTOs.
  6.4. TCTO Implementation:
     6.4.1. 56 MXG TODO will coordinate with the appropriate Quality Assurance (QA)
     subject matter expert for each incoming TCTO to determine applicability. If the TCTO
     applies to our equipment, it will be loaded in the Automated Technical Order
     Management System (ATOMS) database, and date stamped for the date received. 56
     MXG TODO will retain one original copy, give the primary TCTO manager a copy of
     the original, and stamp all others “Working Copy”. NOTE: Any TCTO without a 56
     MXG TODO date stamp and “Working Copy” stamp is not valid. Any shop that receives
     a “back door” copy from another source must forward it to the 56 MXG TODO to have it
     validated before use.
     6.4.2. Primary TCTO managers will be notified that the TCTO is approved and stamped
     via e-mail. The TCTO manager will send an e-mail to affected work centers stating
     meeting details and attach a copy of the TCTO for review.
     6.4.3. Classified TCTOs and TCTO kits will be promptly transferred from 56 MXG
     TODO to the responsible primary TCTO manager when they arrive. While AIS may
     allow overnight storage of classified material in their safe, they cannot support long-term
     storage. The primary TCTO manager will distribute or store the classified items, as
     required.
     6.4.4. Primary TCTO managers will hold a TCTO meeting within 7 duty days of receipt
     to discuss the TCTO with key players from the affected work center and PS&D, as
     required. During this meeting, working copies of the TCTO will be distributed by the
     TODO to affected work centers. The primary TCTO manager will preside over the
     meeting, with inputs from QA and a work center representative from each section tasked
     by the TCTO. The discussion will address specifics of the TCTO, lay out a plan of attack,
     discuss concerns, scheduling requirements, kit proofing, and supply status (if applicable).

        An AF Form 2410, or locally developed product, will be used to document attendance
        and key issues discussed at the meeting.
        6.4.5. QA will kit proof every TCTO to verify its technical accuracy, if it has not been
        previously kit proofed. If an aircraft TCTO kit proof is required, it will be completed on
        each aircraft block affected. No other units may begin the TCTO, until the kit proofing
        has been satisfactorily validated. The results will be annotated on an AFTO Form 82,
        TCTO Verification Certificate, and maintained in the TCTO folder by the primary TCTO
        manager. A copy will also be forwarded to 56 MXG TODO. If the kit proofing revealed
        areas of concern, TODO will forward the information to the point of contact responsible
        for the TCTO.
        6.4.6. QA will observe the accomplishment of the first TCTO completed for procedural
        verification.
     6.5. TCTO folders: Primary and secondary TCTO managers will maintain TCTO folders
     using the Master TCTO Folder format from Wing PS&D arranged as follows:
        6.5.1. Notes Page.
        6.5.2. Copy of TCTO, with Supplements and Messages.
        6.5.3. AF Form 2410.
        6.5.4. Supply Information, AFTO Form 82, and AF IMT 2001, Notification of TCTO Kit
        Requirements (if applicable).
        6.5.5. IMDS product.
        6.5.6. Miscellaneous Items.
7. Aircraft Configuration Management Procedures:
     7.1. PS&D will manage IMDS screen 690 Generic Configuration Status Accounting
     Subsystem (GCSAS) error notices on a daily basis and coordinate correction with the
     appropriate work centers, as required.
     7.2. PS&D will manage the serially controlled items/time change aircraft configuration
     portion using MSAT for inventorying missing items weekly. List of missing items from
     aircraft will be researched and corrected.
     7.3. For phase aircraft, in addition to the 942/990 printouts, PS&D will include part/serial
     number verification sheets in the package for physical verification of listed parts during
     phase. Once completed sheets are received from phase, PS&D will verify the information
     against IMDS screen 810 Parts Tracked Inquiry for accuracy. Items that do not match will
     be re-verified by phase and PS&D will make corrections as necessary.
     7.4. If an item is received/installed with a part number not listed in the approved
     configuration table in IMDS, PS&D will contact the item manager for guidance.
8. Transfer Inspections:
     8.1. PS&D will:
