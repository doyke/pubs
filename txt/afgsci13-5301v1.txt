                                GENERAL INFORMATION


1.1. Training Program. Self-study and crew level training are the key foundational elements of
crew member knowledge and proficiency. Unit level training supports these activities with
formal standardized training. Training must challenge personnel to ensure all concepts are
understood to correctly respond to all tasks and to execute the unit’s mission. Training goes
beyond qualification requirements and is intended to increase a person’s knowledge of job-
related tasks, other duty positions, and the work environment.
  1.1.1. Units will design and implement a structured training program to ensure procedures
  contained in technical orders, checklists, Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), and
  operations manuals are standardized, accurate, and effective to accomplish the mission.
  1.1.2. Units will train in accordance with established weapon system Training and Evaluation
  Performance Standards (TEPS) and EWO TEPS (ETEPS). TEPS/ETEPS define the special
  set of skills required for mission accomplishment and are the overarching guidelines detailing
  how to train all the tasks necessary for operational crew members to become and maintain
  mission-ready status.
     1.1.2.1. Reference Attachment 2 and AFGSC Instruction (AFGSCI) 13-5301v4, (S) Rapid
     Execution and Combat Targeting (REACT) Emergency War Order (EWO) Training and
     Evaluation Procedures (U), for the Job Performance Requirement (JPR) List (JPRL).
     1.1.2.2. Reference Attachments 3 through 5 and AFGSCI 13-5301v4 for a complete listing
     of established performance standards.
  1.1.3. For purposes of this instruction and responsibilities of the training offices, weapon
  system tasks include AXX – EXX (with the exception of E09), and GXX JPRs. Codes tasks
  are limited to E09 JPRs and EWO tasks include FXX JPRs.
  1.1.4. The required skills and knowledge necessary for combat mission ready (CMR) certified
  crew members to perform the mission are measured by the operations group’s evaluation
  program to judge the effectiveness of training and crew force proficiency.
  1.1.5. In the event of a contradiction between this instruction and other REACT crew member
  training guidance found in another Major Command (MAJCOM) or lower publication, this
  instruction will take precedence. Units will notify HQ AFGSC/A3T and the OPR of the
  conflicting instruction through appropriate channels of the specific paragraphs.

Trainer (MEPCT) provide controlled off-line environments to emphasize crew interaction,
dynamics and prioritization while simulating operational scenarios to accomplish training.
     3.2.1. Units should maximize use of an off-line environment to conduct training. Every effort
     will be made to limit the use of the operational environment for training when off-line training
     devices are non-existent or degraded.
       3.2.1.1. The MEPCT is an effective supplemental instructional aid for EWO training and
       self-study; however, it does not provide the fidelity required to satisfy MPT training
       requirements and will not be used for that purpose.
       3.2.1.2. The Chief, ICBM Emergency War Orders will document verification of MPT
       databases and maintain documentation until the next MPT software update. Reference
       AFGSCI 13-5301v4 for additional details to accomplish database verification.
     3.2.2. Prior to conducting a training session in the operational environment, units must gauge
     impact to field operations before dispatching instructors or trainees. Units will use risk
     management processes to mitigate any adverse operational impact.
AFGSCI 13-5301V1 (Date)                                                                    25

  3.2.3. When instructors other than the on-duty crew are conducting training on operational
  equipment, the on-duty crew commander maintains authority during the session. Safety and
  operational requirements take priority over simulated activities.
  3.2.4. Only CMR certified instructors are authorized to conduct training in the MPT or on
  operational equipment (EXCEPTION: BMC qualified weapons officers are permitted to
  conduct training in the MPT).

available at the wing to provide a broader understanding of the nuclear enterprise and a deeper
understanding of the REACT weapon system, Minuteman III and re-entry system/vehicle
(RS/RV).
     3.5.1. The T7 program is considered enrichment training; therefore, crewmembers will not be
     restricted from alert duties for failing to accomplish training.
       3.5.1.1. The T7 program will be considered a mandatory training appointment for CMR
       certified personnel. Each wing will develop processes to accomplish training that was
       missed.
     3.5.2. Units will conduct T7 on a recurring basis for the entire crew force. The intent is to
     conduct T7 on a monthly basis as part of a regularly scheduled EWO, codes or weapon system
     classroom session to minimize extra events on crew member schedules.
       3.5.2.1. T7 topics should be related to required JPR training for that particular month as
       much as practical.
AFGSCI 13-5301V1 (Date)                                                                      27

     3.5.2.2. T7 topics may be taught at the beginning of the regularly scheduled classroom
     session or in conjunction with each related JPR.
       3.5.2.2.1. If T7 topics are not directly related to a required JPR for the current month,
       the instruction will be given at the beginning of the classroom session.
     3.5.2.3. Units may choose to use guest lecturers or to incorporate educational activities as
     part of the T7 program (scheduling all crewmembers to visit the on-base LF trainer, etc.).
     Units are not required to conduct a classroom T7 session during the month utilizing these
     forums, but must ensure the event is scheduled in a manner to accommodate students,
     location and guest speakers, as applicable.
       3.5.2.3.1. Unit OSB vaults will not be utilized for educational visits without prior

  AFGSCI 13-5301v4.
  5.1.3. Completion of proficiency training will be documented. Documentation must be
  retained for a minimum of 12 months.
5.2. Recurring Training. RT is developed, conducted and documented under the supervision of
a certified instructor to emphasize knowledge and skills not used on a routine basis as well as
knowledge and skill deficiencies identified through feedback. RT provides the medium for
knowledge enhancement training. The training increases a person’s knowledge of job-related
tasks, other duty positions, and the work environment.
  5.2.1. RT may include, but is not limited to, individual task presentation, classroom
  presentations, computer-based training, knowledge testing, MPT training scenarios, and on-
  duty crew observations.
  5.2.2. All BMC and CMR personnel will be trained in all weapon system and codes
  proficiency and/or knowledge level tasks or subtasks at least once every 12 months and all
  EWO tasks or subtasks in accordance with AFGSCI 13-5301v4.
     5.2.2.1. JPR coverage for each training session will be in accordance with a standardized
     annual training and evaluation plan (ATEP). The ATEP identifies when JPRs will be
     trained and the number of times JPRs will be evaluated at each wing. Task or subtask
     levels are emphasized, and the method of training (weapon system training, MPT session,
     etc.) is identified for each JPR.
     5.2.2.2. Evaluations will not be used in lieu of training to satisfy annual training
     requirements.
  5.2.3. Crew members will begin receiving weapon system, codes and/or EWO RT the first
  month following completion of each respective initial training at the unit. For example, an
  individual completes initial codes training in January and is scheduled to complete T16 and
  initial EWO training in February. In February, the individual will be required to receive the
  monthly codes classroom training and test. The individual will be required to receive all
  monthly classroom training sessions in March, now that all initial training requirements have
  been accomplished.
     5.2.3.1. Restricted missile combat crew members (MCCM) should continue to receive RT.
     5.2.3.2. Decertified MCCMs do not need to attend RT. Individuals must accomplish RQT

     (EXCEPTION: BMC qualified individuals are not required to test in accordance with
     paragraph 2.4.3.1.1.)
       5.2.4.1. The intent is for crew members to receive training on JPRs during each calendar
       month; however, as long as a particular month’s JPR coverage as directed by the ATEP is
       met prior to expiration of that month, restriction is not warranted provided that the training
       and test have been coordinated in accordance with paragraph 3.1.4.
       5.2.4.2. Failure to accomplish any of the training or tests will result in restriction in
       accordance with chapter 2.
          5.2.4.2.1. Personnel who develop the RT knowledge test are exempt from taking the RT
          knowledge test for the month they developed. Personnel will not develop successive RT
          knowledge tests.
          5.2.4.2.2. A waiver request must be submitted by the unit if an operational situation or
          extenuating circumstance prevents any monthly training from being accomplished.
     5.2.5. Recurring MPT sessions will be accomplished as an integral crew when operationally
     feasible.
     5.2.6. Recurring MPT sessions will be administered as the ACP/SCP. Regardless of
     ACP/SCP certification, all crew members will be trained performing ACP/SCP actions.
     5.2.7. A recurring MPT session must have a CMR certified MCCC (or dual-qualified MCCC)
     with the following exceptions:
       5.2.7.1. In the event two DMCCCs accomplish the monthly proficiency MPT session as
       part of an upgrade sequence, both crewmembers will receive credit for their recurring
       proficiency MPT session regardless of the qualification rating received during the upgrade
       evaluation.
       5.2.7.2. In the event a CMR certified DMCCC accomplishes the monthly proficiency MPT
       session with either a BMC/BMK qualified commander or with a non-certified staff officer
       during the staff officer’s CMR upgrade sequence, the crew member will receive credit for
       the monthly proficiency MPT session.
     5.2.8. HQ AFGSC/A3T, AFGSC/A3I and 20 AF/A3 will coordinate training requirements for
     each major EWO change/revision. Requirements will be provided to the units no later than 60
     days prior to the EWO change/revision.
       5.2.8.1. During the month prior to each OPLAN revision or major EWO change effective
       date, RT will include instruction on the upcoming revision/change material in addition to
       training on required tasks and procedures not affected by the revision or change.
       5.2.8.2. HQ AFGSC/A3I and A3T will coordinate to ensure all documents, materials and
       guidance required to implement OPLAN/EWO changes are transmitted to the units far
       enough in advance of the effective date to allow for construction of training materials.
AFGSCI 13-5301V1 (Date)                                                                      35

5.3. Individual Training. IT is developed, conducted and documented under the supervision of
a certified instructor in response to individual crew or crew member performance deficiency and
to accomplish training for individuals who failed or did not complete any monthly RT
requirement.
  5.3.1. The squadron commander or operations officer may direct IT as deemed necessary.
  5.3.2. If training was directed for any major error following an evaluation or equivalent field
  deviation, conduct the training as soon as possible after notification. If scheduling permits,
  conduct the training prior to the individual performing alert duties. Units may use existing
  lesson plans and scripts.
5.4. Supplemental Training. ST is developed, conducted and documented under the supervision
of a certified instructor to train crew members on new/changed procedures, hardware or software
when RQT is not warranted and to train crew members for significant upcoming events
(Simulated Electronic Launch-Minuteman (SELM), code change, communication system
exercises, etc.). ST may be directed by squadron commanders, operations officers or higher
authority.
  5.4.1. ST will be developed based on the operational impact(s) of the new or changed
  procedure(s), hardware, or software.
  5.4.2. When developing or changing training materials, any changes will be added to all
  training programs.
  5.4.3. Changes directly affecting mission accomplishment or safety will be administered to all
  personnel before they perform crew duty (alert, evaluation, or MPT session, etc.), otherwise,
  changes will be administered to all personnel during RT.
  5.4.4. Any certified instructor may present supplemental training.
  5.4.5. OSS will track completion of supplemental training to ensure all crew members receive
  necessary training. All supplemental training will be documented, but does not count as
  recurring training.
5.5. Self-Study Training. The OSS will ensure monthly self-study packets are produced to
assist MCCs prepare for recurring EWO, weapon system and codes classroom training as well as
the monthly MPT training sessions.
  5.5.1. At a minimum, self-study packets will:
     5.5.1.1. Complement lesson plan topics that will be covered during the classroom session.
     5.5.1.2. [Not applicable to codes] List the current month’s recurring MPT task coverage to
     facilitate task review prior to simulator training.
        5.5.1.2.1. Units may list FXX JPR task coverage in the weapon system self-study
        packet; however, the listing shall be unclassified.
     5.5.1.3. Contain starting status information for the current month’s MPT session to
     facilitate crew mission planning prior to simulator training.
        5.5.1.3.1. Starting status information is only required to be in the monthly self-study
        packet generated for weapon system training.<
36                                                                 AFGSCI 13-5301V1 (Date)

       5.5.1.4. Discuss high missed questions from previous month’s knowledge test. Self-study
       packets are not required to contain this information prior to coordination.
       5.5.1.5. Discuss any trends identified from evaluation errors or field deviations. The
       discussion will include details on trends, lessons learned and related TTPs for preventing
       the trend in the future.
       5.5.1.6. Contain a test similar to the monthly knowledge test. Questions used in the self-
       study packets will not be used on the classroom test.
     5.5.2. MCCCs are responsible to ensure their DMCCC accomplishes the self-study packet and
     that crew mission planning is conducted.
AFGSCI 13-5301V1 (Date)                                                                     37

                            TRAINING SCENARIOS AND SCRIPTS


6.1. Training Scenarios. The purpose of a training scenario is to reinforce classroom training,
guide individual self-study, allow students to demonstrate proficiency in performance level tasks
and to maintain an individual’s or crew’s proficiency. Training scenarios will test the ability to
multi-task, and force personnel to react to situations ranging from fundamental to complex in a
controlled environment. Scenarios will emphasize knowledge and skills necessary to execute the
mission.
  6.1.1. Crew members should be trained in a realistic crew environment.
  6.1.2. Each MPT session must have the following items available:
     6.1.2.1. TEAP-TF 214.
     6.1.2.2. Training targeting documents [i.e. Handbook for ICBM Targeting (HIT) TF 214,
     TTATD, TRFTL and execution plan/target case prints as applicable].
     6.1.2.3. Communication and Reporting Directive (CARD).
     6.1.2.4. Training PC documents.
     6.1.2.5. Training decode documents (i.e. KTC-D-165, KTC-D-221, KTC-D-2230 and
     KTC-274).

     6.1.2.10. SACCS DTS User Guide.
     6.1.2.11. Checklists and simulation materials not listed above that are necessary to present
     a scripted scenario.
  6.1.3. Scenarios administered to an individual or crew may consist of a single task, a group of
  tasks strung together or multiple tasks occurring simultaneously.
  6.1.4. Training scenario results are based on crew member performance on each task or
  subtask with respect to the applicable performance standard.
38                                                                   AFGSCI 13-5301V1 (Date)

     6.1.5. Operational environment training will be used to train tasks that cannot be otherwise
     simulated (UHF Checkout, LCEB inspections, blast door operation, etc.). Use a lesson plan to
     minimize the risk and standardize the training shown in the operational environment.
       6.1.5.1. When instructors other than the on-duty crew are conducting training on
       operational equipment, the on-duty crew commander maintains authority during the
       training session.
     6.1.6. Crews will be given the opportunity to conduct mission planning to apply critical
     thinking skills necessary to execute the MPT training event. The MPT instructor will review
     the crew’s mission plan as part of the MPT training session in-brief.
       6.1.6.1. Missile combat crew mission planning will incorporate applicable aspects of the
       five mission planning phases outlined in AFGSCI 13-5301v3, Rapid Execution and
       Combat Targeting (REACT) Crew Operations. The Crew Preparation, GO/NO-GO Brief,
       and Re-Planning phases are not required to be completed during mission planning for MPT
       training events.
          6.1.6.1.1. The Data Gathering Phase will be used to provide crews with the most
          comprehensive and accurate data for use in successfully planning and executing the
          MPT training event. Data will be presented to crews in the local monthly weapon
          system training package. Information provided will be similar to data gathered for alert
          [weather, planned maintenance, MAF/Launch Facility (LF) status, etc.].
          6.1.6.1.2. The Crew Plan Development Phase will be used for crews to discuss their plan
          for successfully completing scenarios as well as potential outcomes based upon starting
          status. It is not possible to plan for all contingencies, but crews should develop backup
          plans for those that are most likely. This phase will be conducted in the LCC, squadron
          or appropriate OG mission planning facility and will be led by the crew commander.
       6.1.6.2. Trainees must be provided facilities to conduct mission planning prior to an MPT
       training session. A copy of operations technical orders, nuclear surety and security
       directives or any other reference material helpful to mission planning in accordance with
       local procedures must be readily available.
       6.1.6.3. Both crewmembers must be present during mission planning unless specifically
       excused by squadron operations officer or higher authority.
       6.1.6.4. All personnel dispatching for a training alert or other training related actions must
       accomplish mission planning in accordance with AFGSCI 13-5301v3.
6.2. Scenario Support Personnel. Scenario support personnel are individuals in addition to
instructors that participate in presenting a training scenario as required. These may include, but
are not limited to, MPT operator, trusted agents, and other personnel necessary to ensure proper
scenario presentation.
     6.2.1. Only certified instructors or personnel under the supervision of a certified instructor
     will act as support personnel.
6.3. Training Scripts. Units will design and use scripts to conduct training scenarios to ensure
standardization of presentation and proper application of performance standards. Scripts will
include instructions for instructors, scenario support personnel, simulated inputs, and status card
inputs as applicable.
AFGSCI 13-5301V1 (Date)                                                                       39



  6.3.1. Proficiency and upgrade scripts will contain valid peacetime and wartime stimuli.
  Stimuli will be identified by JPR, task description, scenario support personnel, initiation and
  response agencies and notes or expected responses (TEPS/ETEPS notes, instructor notes and
  expected trainee response, etc.).
     6.3.1.1. Estimated scenario run times, if included, are for scenario presentation only and do
     not establish a time standard for completing actions. Applicable time standards must be
     annotated within the script.
     6.3.1.2. Monthly and qualification MPT sessions will have a minimum of four Level A
     performance events.
  6.3.2. Do not create actual conditions that could jeopardize personnel safety or cause
  equipment damage.
  6.3.3. Training scripts will be technically accurate in accordance with technical orders and
  applicable directives.
  6.3.4. EWO and weapon system portions of training may be designed to provide a seamless
  training session.
  6.3.5. Monthly recurring training scripts should not be designed to exceed 4 hours.
     6.3.5.1. The intent of the 4 hour training script is to dedicate no more than three hours to
     the monthly JPR training requirements and to dedicate the remaining hour to a specific
     focus area.
     6.3.5.2. Recommended focus areas consist of fires, emergency power/air procedure,
     security/contingency, codes/safety, EWO and communication systems.
        6.3.5.2.1. Units may train one of the recommended focus areas, or train other focus areas
        determined by the units to address deficiencies identified through methods such as trend
        analysis or field deviations.
        6.3.5.2.2. The one hour focus area may be used to satisfy a monthly JPR requirement
        (EXAMPLE: security situation requirement for a specific month could be accomplished
        in a security focus area during that same month).
  6.3.6. Training scripts other than the monthly recurring training scripts should not be designed
  to exceed the scheduled MPT time.
  6.3.7. Units must retain training scripts and ancillary items such as dispatches, status cards
  and script programs in either paper or electronic copy for a period of at least 12 months from
  the on-line date. This does not require a removable storage element for old revision products.
  Off-line scripts do not require updates.
     6.3.7.1. A monthly script may be considered off-line once it has been administered to all
     BMC and CMR individuals. All other scripts may be considered off-line after it has been
     used for its intended purpose.
6.4. TEPS/ETEPS and Timing Constraints. TEPS detail task performance, standards, timing
requirements and constraints for the express purpose of standardizing training and evaluation that
support operational mission ready certification requirements.
40                                                                  AFGSCI 13-5301V1 (Date)

6.4.1. TEPS/ETEPS are designed for preparing and presenting training and evaluation materials
and will be used to prioritize tasks during an evaluation. TEPS/ETEPS will not supplement
technical data or instructions.
     6.4.2. TEPS/ETEPS are divided into three levels.
       6.4.2.1. Level A - Tasks, if not performed correctly, could result in mission failure,
       endangerment of human life, serious injury or death or require an elevated level of
       proficiency.
          6.4.2.1.1. Level A tasks have the greatest potential for mission and/or personnel impacts
          and drive the most stringent training and evaluation program requirements.
          6.4.2.1.2. Asterisked Level A performance standards are not subject to judgment and
          require strict application and adherence. An asterisked Level A is used where a direct
          correlation exists between exceeding the time and a tangible undesirable outcome, or a
          task requires a higher level of proficiency necessary for mission accomplishment.
          6.4.2.1.3. Non-asterisked Level A performance standards provide an objective
          measurement guideline for performances requiring urgent action. Because event
          outcome may be influenced by outside factors, there is not always a direct correlation
          between outcome and successful completion of task-associated actions within the
          specified time parameter(s). Exceeding one of these times may not indicate a serious
          deficiency based on judgment and assessment of the specific scenario. Non-asterisked
          performance standards are guidelines to aid unit commanders in determining corrective
          actions.
          6.4.2.1.4. If the subsequent event has a Level A time standard, time it normally, without
          adjustment for the "pending" original time standard.
          6.4.2.1.5. When more than one Level A time standard is running simultaneously, time
          them concurrently only if specifically written for concurrent timing, otherwise, time
          separately and sequentially.
       6.4.2.2. Level B - Tasks deemed integral to the performance of other tasks and required to
       sustain acceptable weapon system operation and mission execution.
          6.4.2.2.1. Operators must accomplish Level B tasks properly without taking any
          intervening lower priority actions that would, in the normal sequence of events,
          adversely affect task performance or outcome.
       6.4.2.3. Level C - Rudimentary or simple tasks related to weapon system operations that by
       themselves have little or no impact on mission execution.
          6.4.2.3.1. Level C tasks apply where no specific time standard is identified. The
          standard is to accomplish the task proficiently in accordance with technical orders and
          governing directives.
     6.4.3. Outside agency responses will not be used to satisfy accomplishment of TEPS. If the
     missile combat crew (MCC) has the technical data to satisfy their required tasks, the outside
     agency will not provide that data.
AFGSCI 13-5301V1 (Date)                                                                        41

   6.4.4. TEPS/ETEPS do not describe the only correct response and do not replace operational
   technical data or instructions. They are intended for a controlled scenario environment and
   are used to improve proficiency.
   6.4.5. Crew Enrichment Training (CET) scenarios may be used to train scenarios and event
   timing outside the constraints listed for a particular JPR in order to achieve MCCM
   proficiency above the standards established for evaluation performance.
      6.4.5.1. CET scenarios will only be used for training and should be realistic.
      6.4.5.2. CET scenarios must be clearly identified in training materials. Events will be
      labeled as CET, with the specific task constraint or timing standard violated as well as a
      brief description of the purpose for the event.
      6.4.5.3. The Chief, ICBM Current Operations Training will determine when training
      beyond TEPS constraints is authorized. The Chief, ICBM Emergency War Orders will
      determine when training beyond ETEPS constraints is authorized.
6.5. Status Presentation. Crew members must be presented proper configuration and status for
operational realism.
   6.5.1. Instructors should always provide status that crew members would normally detect with
   their senses (heat, air, smoke, etc.) when it cannot be simulated by the MPT. Status cards will
   be used to the maximum extent possible. Instructors will ensure proper configuration is
   programmed whenever possible or briefed to the crew.
   6.5.2. Status presentation requirements and configuration actions for fire/overheat conditions,
   nuclear detonation (NUDET) and Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP)/High Altitude Burst (HAB)
   indications will be provided by 20 AF. Reference AFGSCI 13-5301v4 for additional
   presentation or configuration requirements.
   6.5.3. Status cards and briefings will be standardized and presented in accordance with 20 AF
   direction.
6.6. Briefings. It is the responsibility of the instructors to conduct appropriate briefings
throughout the course of the MPT session.
   6.6.1. Instructors will conduct a pre-brief to set the environment of the training and to ensure
   the trainee clearly understands expectations, responsibilities, limitations and other rules of
   engagement before being administered training scenarios.
   6.6.2. For training scenarios conducted in the operational environment, instructors will pre-
   brief the on-duty crew, Flight Security Controller (FSC), Facility Manager (FM) and other
   topside support personnel as applicable, ensuring they understand their roles and limitations.
      6.6.2.1. Safety and operational requirements take priority over simulated activities.
      Instructors will intervene to prevent a safety hazard or damage to equipment. Additionally,
      for training conducted in the operational environment, instructors will intervene to prevent
      mission failure or degradation.
   6.6.3. Instructors may use briefings as necessary for scenario transitions, scenario presentation
   in accordance with the script and to emphasize concepts presented in the lesson plan.
42                                                                  AFGSCI 13-5301V1 (Date)

     6.6.4. Instructors will not lead or prompt trainees into taking a correct action. To ensure
     effective use of training resources and prevent improper procedures from being reinforced,
     they may step in to redirect trainees once they are satisfied the crew is accomplishing
     incorrect actions or failing to accomplish required actions.
       6.6.4.1. Provide training to correct deficiencies and reinforce the proper actions for task
       accomplishment as soon as practical after a trainee takes an incorrect action.
6.7. Scenario Termination. Once a training session is started, all efforts will be made to
complete the session.
     6.7.1. Situations may arise in which early termination would be required. Training scenarios
     terminated early may be re-initiated from the point activity was originally stopped, or it may
     be completely re-accomplished.
6.8. Debriefing and Outbriefing the Trainee. The crew debrief and instructor outbrief provides
feedback to the trainee and the training program.
     6.8.1. The debrief is intended to provide crews the opportunity to conduct critical self-
     assessment of their performance, identify deficiencies and develop mitigation strategies for
     continual improvement. Data gathered in the debrief will be used in the formal instructor
     outbrief.
     6.8.2. The outbrief is intended to provide instructors the opportunity to discuss positive
     performance, strengths and crew goals, any noted deficiencies, probable causes, areas for
     improvement, deficiency mitigation, and direct or indirect impacts to the mission, personnel,
     and other organizations.
AFGSCI 13-5301V1 (Date)                                                                      43

                    INSTRUCTOR TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION


7.1. Instructor Training and Certification Program. The training and certification program is
developed and administered to ensure certified instructors can conduct standardized, objective
training.
  7.1.1. For purposes of this chapter:
     7.1.1.1. Individuals certified to provide classroom instruction on weapon system JPRs and
     weapon system, EWO and codes instruction in the MPT will be referred to as weapon
     system instructors.
     7.1.1.2. Individuals certified to provide classroom instruction on codes JPRs will be
     referred to as codes instructors.
     7.1.1.3. Individuals certified to provide classroom instruction on EWO JPRs will be
     referred to as EWO instructors.
        7.1.1.3.1. An individual assigned to the EWO Plans Section who instructs CMR crew
        members is considered an EWO instructor and must comply with instructor certification
        requirements outlined in this chapter.
  7.1.2. The Chief, ICBM Current Operations Training/ICBM Emergency War Orders/ICBM
  Codes will develop standardized instructor training programs to administer and meet initial
  and recurring instructor training requirements.
  7.1.3. Units may choose to certify instructors only for the environment in which they will
  provide training (i.e. classroom or simulator).
  7.1.4. Units will document certifications using the AFGSC Form 915, Instructor and
  Evaluator Certifications. However, units may develop and maintain certification worksheets
  to support the final certification(s).
7.2. Instructor Training Requirements. Crew members must receive formal training in the
classroom and MPT environments by certified instructors. Instructor trainees will be observed
and supervised by a certified instructor during all instructor training activities.
  7.2.1. Prior to certification in a particular environment, instructor trainees must accomplish
  the following actions:

     the individual no longer performs the unique duties.
8.2. Documenting Deficiencies. Documenting identified deficiencies provides a means to
identify trends, track individual performance, provides performance feedback to the individual’s
supervisor and serves as a key feedback and training program tool.
  8.2.1. When the trainee causes a script deviation and an incorrect action results, the instructor
  will document deficiencies against the JPR to which the deficiency should be attributed.
     8.2.1.1. If a crew member recognizes a status change but fails to perform a required JPR,
     document the deviation against the JPR that should have been performed.
     8.2.1.2. If a crew member recognizes a status change but performs the wrong JPR,
     document the deviation against the JPR that should have been performed. However, give
     JPR credit for the task or subtask that was performed.
     8.2.1.3. If a crew member does not recognize a status change and a resulting task or subtask
     requirement, document the deviation against the required JPR.
     8.2.1.4. When the JPR being performed directs transition to another task or subtask, and the
     trainee fails to perform the subsequent task or subtask or fails to identify the requirement to
     transition, document the deviation against the JPR that directed the transition.
     8.2.1.5. If a crew member performs an unnecessary action which causes or results in a
     deviation, document the deviation against the JPR being performed when the unnecessary
     action was taken.

     training session. Proficiency ratings are subjective based on instructor observation; however,
     the following guidelines are provided to assist instructors assigning proficiency ratings:
       8.3.2.1. An ”Unsatisfactory” rating should be assigned when a deficiency assessed meets
       major or critical error severity as defined in AFGSCI 13-5301v2, or if an MCC’s
       demonstrated proficiency or knowledge is cause for concern.
       8.3.2.2. A “Satisfactory” rating should be assigned when procedures are performed
       correctly and any deficiencies assessed meet minor error severity as defined in AFGSCI
       13-5301v2.
       8.3.2.3. An “Exceeds Standards” rating may be assigned when scenarios are performed
       correctly and an MCC’s demonstrated proficiency or knowledge exceeded standard
       expectations (use of TTPs, extraordinary crew coordination, etc.)
       8.3.2.4. Coordination signatures are required if any category was assigned an
       “Unsatisfactory” proficiency rating.

                                             Chapter 9
                                       MISCELLANEOUS


9.1. Crew Member Upgrade and PCA Requirements. There is no substitute for field
experience. Proficiency, experience, and leadership are important attributes to consider when
selecting individuals for instructor duty or upgrades.
     9.1.1. Individuals should meet the following minimums for upgrade, evaluator or weapon
     system instructor duty:
       9.1.1.1. A deputy should have 42 alerts to be eligible for ACP/SCP certification.
       9.1.1.2. A deputy should have 72 alerts or 12 months of CMR time (whichever comes first)
       to be eligible for evaluator or instructor duty.
       9.1.1.3. A deputy will be eligible for commander upgrade upon completion of evaluator or
       instructor duty.
       9.1.1.4. A deputy that remained in a missile squadron should have 96 alerts or 16 months of
       CMR time (whichever comes first) to be eligible for commander upgrade.
       9.1.1.5. A commander should have 42 alerts as a commander to be eligible for ACP/SCP
       certification if he or she was not previously ACP/SCP certified as a deputy.
          9.1.1.5.1. There are no guidelines for minimum number of alerts for a commander that
          was previously ACP/SCP certified as a deputy.
       9.1.1.6. A commander should have 48 alerts as a commander to be eligible for evaluator or
       weapon system instructor duty.
9.2. New or Upgrade System Requirements. For new or upgraded missile systems, the unit
training office will develop the training program to meet requirements within this instruction,
AFGSCI 13-5301v3, AFGSCI 13-5301v4, AFGSCI 36-283, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile
Training System Management, and AFGSCI 10-604, Global Strike Operational Weapon Systems
Management.
     9.2.1. When a new unit or duty position is established, new equipment or system
     modifications occur, or new or significantly changed operations procedures requiring training
     or evaluation occur, the most experienced or qualified personnel in the unit may be designated
     as the SME and CMR.
       9.2.1.1. The OG/CC or designated representative will appoint a limited number of SMEs in
       writing. Document SME appointment on the individual’s AFGSC Form 91. Forward the
       SME designation memorandum through the chain of command directly to HQ
       AFGSC/A3T and 20 AF/A3.
       9.2.1.2. SME designation only applies to those individuals necessary to develop and
       conduct the appropriate training and evaluation programs, or individuals necessary to
       support the operations, test, and evaluation process.
     9.2.2. SMEs must accomplish the appropriate training for the duty position, such as
     contractor-provided Type I training, and meet requirements in paragraphs 2.5.1.
AFGSCI 13-5301V1 (Date)                                                                     57

     9.2.2.1. Upon completion of SME training, individuals will be CMR. The primary duty of
     the CMR certified SMEs is to develop technical documentation, training materials, and to
     conduct training.
  9.2.3. SMEs will be evaluated in accordance with AFGSCI 13-5301v2.
9.3. Command Change Process to AETC Course Curriculum. All change requests
originating from AFGSC units which are of a major nature (a request which drives changes in
course training standard or resources such as manpower, facilities, cost, etc.) will be routed
through the appropriate functional’s chain to HQ AFGSC/A3TO for coordination.
  9.3.1. The AETC training manager is the decision authority for determining if a proposed
  change is minor or major. No official direct communication concerning major changes is
  permitted with AETC training units except in gathering information necessary to properly
  staff the request.
     9.3.1.1. This does not preclude official feedback channels such as the IST Graduate
     Training Verification Process, Graduate Assessment Survey, field evaluation
     questionnaires or field visits.
  9.3.2. HQ AFGSC/A3TO coordinates approval of change requests through the wings and 20
  AF. HQ AFGSC/A3T approves all formal requests to change AETC courses and submits to
  HQ USAF/A3/5 (Operations Plans and Requirements) for coordination.
  9.3.3. Upon approval of a major change request by HQ AFGSC/A3T, HQ AFGSC/A3TO will
  route the change to HQ USAF/A3/5. HQ USAF/A3/5 will review and, if approved, will route
  to the Chief, Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) and Space
  Training (HQ AETC/A3TI).
  9.3.4. The 381st Training Group (TRG) will analyze the request to determine impact on
  manpower and training time and will return their cost estimate to HQ AFGSC/A3TO for
  proper staffing (manpower costs, training device requirements, etc.). HQ AFGSC/A3TO will
  notify the originating agency of the results of their request. For further information, refer to
  AFGSCI 36-283.
  9.3.5. Changes to existing Specialty Training Standards and/or Course Training Standards
  require review and approval by the affected unit commander. Changes will be routed through
  the appropriate OSS or group to HQ AFGSC/A3TO for final review and approval, prior to
  381 TRG/CC approval, signature, and publication.
  9.3.6. AFGSC units will obtain a tracking number through their appropriate OSS or group in
  order to coordinate minor change requests directly with the 381 TRG. Coordination will only
  be done with the training manager (TM) of the applicable training course.
     9.3.6.1. Minor changes are interpreted to mean those of an administrative nature or those
     which do not have significant impact on training curricula or resources. In each case, the
     381 TRG TM will determine if the request is of a minor nature or needs to be elevated to a
     major change. If the request is minor, the 381 TRG will implement the change at the
     earliest opportunity.
58                                                              AFGSCI 13-5301V1 (Date)

     9.3.7. Changes originating from the 381 TRG TMs will be forwarded to the affected OSS or
     group for action, with a courtesy copy provided to HQ AFGSC/A3TO and 20 AF. Once the
     review is complete and OSS or group concurrence has been given, the change will be routed
     back through HQ AFGSC/A3TO for approval in accordance with the guidance above.
     9.3.8. Deletions of 381 TRG courses are reviewed, approved, and forwarded by HQ
     AFGSC/A3T to HQ USAF/A3/5 for review and approval prior to routing to HQ AETC/A3TI.
     Request for course deletions must be forwarded from the appropriate group commander,
     through 20 AF, to AFGSC/A3T.

                      JOB PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT LIST


A2.1. Sections Comprising the JPRL.
  A2.1.1. The JPR column contains the alphanumeric designation for each JPR.
     A2.1.1.1. Area – A grouping of tasks that support the accomplishment of a single mission
     or multiple mission components.
     A2.1.1.2. Task – An observable/measurable unit of work that independently forms a
     significant part of a duty and is selected to reflect mission needs.
     A2.1.1.3. Subtasks – A subordinate unit of work derived from a task. Subtasks generally,
     but not always, focus on capabilities or reporting requirements that are utilized to
     accomplish a task.
  A2.1.2. The Description column contains the task nomenclature.
     A2.1.2.1. A description marked with a superscripted number indicates the JPR does not
     apply to all units. Superscript numbers are coded as follows: 0 = 532d Training Squadron
     (TRS), 1 = 341st Missile Wing (MW), 3 = 91 MW, 5 = 90 MW.
  A2.1.3. The Exposure heading is supported by three columns indicating different methods of
  JPR exposure.
     A2.1.3.1. The TEPS column indicates the task TEPS level that JPRs are to be trained and
     evaluated. Reference paragraph 6.4.2. for detailed explanations of the various
     TEPS/ETEPS levels.
     A2.1.3.2. The Training (TRNG) column assigns a task type to a JPR which identifies the
     environment(s) where that JPR is required to be trained.
       A2.1.3.2.1. If the exposure column is blank the task must be trained in the classroom
       and trained in the MPT.
       A2.1.3.2.2. Classroom Tasks. A “C” indicates this JPR is only required to be trained in
       classroom. Classroom tasks are repetitive and may occur inherently in the MPT in order
       to accomplish another JPR. Classroom training is adequate; however, additional
       training may be accomplished in the MPT, self-study package or in the operational
       environment. There is no requirement to plan or track exposure of these JPRs outside
       the classroom environment.
       A2.1.3.2.3. Self-Study Task. An “S” indicates a JPR that is only required to be trained
       through a self-study package. Training through a self-study package is adequate;
       however, additional training may be accomplished in the classroom, MPT or in the
       operational environment. There is no requirement to plan or track exposure of these
       JPRs outside the self-study environment.

          A2.1.3.2.4. Operational-Only Task. An “Ø” indicates a task that cannot be trained in the
          MPT due to missing or nonfunctional equipment. All operational-only tasks must
          receive training in the classroom and in a self-study package. Additional training may
          be accomplished in the operational environment unless the training interferes with
          operational tasks.
          A2.1.3.2.5. Inactive Task. An “I” indicates a JPR that is inactive. Inactive tasks will not
          be trained. HQ 20 AF/A3 will establish training requirements if an “I” task becomes
          active.
       A2.1.3.3. The Evaluation (EVAL) column assigns a task type to a JPR which identifies the
       environment(s) where that JPR may be evaluated as well as the eligibility for that JPR to be
       evaluated.
          A2.1.3.3.1. Required Evaluation Task. An “R” indicates a task that is required to be
          evaluated in the MPT or in the operational environment. Units are required to plan and
          track exposure of these JPRs.
          A2.1.3.3.2. Optional Evaluation Task. An “O” indicates a task that is not required to be
          evaluated. Optional evaluation tasks may be scripted to facilitate scenario presentation
          or may occur inherently in order to accomplish another JPR. There is no requirement to
          plan or track exposure of these JPRs.
          A2.1.3.3.3. Field Evaluatable Task. An “F” indicates a JPR that will not be evaluated in
          the MPT and will not be scripted for an evaluation in the operational environment. If an
          “F” task is performed during an evaluation in the operational environment, evaluate the
          task even though task coverage was not intended and, if applicable, document any errors
          or deviations committed.
          A2.1.3.3.4. Inactive Task. An “I” indicates a JPR that is inactive. Inactive tasks will not
          be evaluated. HQ 20 AF/A3 will establish evaluation requirements if an “I” task
          becomes active.
     A2.1.4. Additional training and evaluation guidance for JPRs.
       A2.1.4.1. With the exception of inactive tasks, all task types will be tested monthly in
       accordance with the ATEP.
       A2.1.4.2. A new task entered in the JPRL is not required to be evaluated before performing
       the task on alert. Following completion of initial task training, the task should be
       emphasized in evaluations during a 3-month period. This period will start based on the
       operational factors and resource constraints affecting each unit’s ability to execute the
       training necessary to achieve proficiency in the new task. The level of exposure should be
       great enough to provide a representative assessment of training effectiveness.

                     INDIVIDUAL QUALIFICATION FOLDER REVIEW
A8.1. Individual Qualification Folder Review. Units are encouraged to use Table A8.1. to
review IQFs. The table is designed as a guide to assist units in conducting a thorough review of
IQFs similar to how SAV team members or HHQ inspectors would review them.
     A8.1.1. This table does not provide a means to conduct a thorough review of supporting
     documentation (initials certifying all MQT requirements were completed, all ACP/SCP
     certification training was completed, etc.). Units must develop processes to ensure all
     prerequisites are accomplished and documented prior to applicable certifications.
       A8.1.1.1. Content and wording in the table is focused on a CMR crew member’s IQF;
       however, BMC and BMK IQFs can also be reviewed using applicable portions of the table.
     A8.1.2. Units are authorized to use “Stop Sign” sheets in the IQFs. Following an IG
     inspection of the IQFs, units may place a “Stop Sign” sheet on top of each section. Inspectors
     should not review IQFs past the “Stop Sign” sheets. Reference Figure A8.1. for sample
     format.
       A8.1.2.1. Units may place “Stop Sign” sheets in section one with a new AFGSC Form
       placed on top, or units may make an entry on the existing AFGSC Form 91 indicating the
       completion date of the IG inspection.
