               MAJCOM-unique site.
           1.2.6.9.2. End-of-Cycle Reporting. Squadrons will submit an End-of-Cycle
           Training Report NLT the 15th of October.
               1.2.6.9.2.1. Report all deviations from the training requirements in this volume or
               the RTM, after proration at the end of the training cycle.
               1.2.6.9.2.2. Squadrons deployed at the end of the training cycle are still required
               to submit an End-of-Cycle Report within the requirements of paragraph
               1.2.5.12.2 Squadrons will report the number of training months and waived
               number of deployed months.

               MAJCOM-unique site.
           1.2.6.9.3. Shortfall and LIMFAC reporting. Report only significant shortfalls or
           LIMFACS that affect 20% or greater of assigned/attached aircrew and all
           events/sorties waived by the OG/CC.
               1.2.6.9.3.1. Shortfalls occur when required mission training tasks are not
               accomplished due to shortages of equipment, personnel, etc. Example: A high
               percentage of inexperienced personnel requiring more training events than
               experienced personnel.
               1.2.6.9.3.2. LIMFACS are factors, constraints, restrictions, etc. that degrade
               training effectiveness. EXAMPLE: an aircrew member is unable to accomplish
               live air-to-air missions due to shortage of live flying activity.
               1.2.6.9.3.3. Include possible solutions or specific assistance required (if
               applicable). The MAJCOM will attempt to rectify or minimize noted
               shortfalls/LIMFACS while the training cycle is under way.
    1.2.7. Flight Commanders:
       1.2.7.1. Monitor and manage individual assigned and attached aircrew member
       currencies and requirements.
       1.2.7.2. Ensure aircrew members participate only in sorties, events and tasks for which
       they are adequately prepared, trained and current.
    1.2.8. Supervisors:
       1.2.8.1. Identify areas where additional training is needed and direct training
       accordingly.
       1.2.8.2. Ensure mission objectives are prebriefed, debriefed, and evaluated to determine
       successful accomplishments.
    1.2.9. Individual aircrew will:
AFI11-2E-3V1 6 AUGUST 2012                                                                         9


      1.2.9.1. Hand carry all available training records to assist the gaining unit in assessing
      certifications and training requirements. Reference AFI 11-202V2 for guidance on
      individual aircrew responsibilities relating to transporting qualification records [i.e. Flight
      Evaluation Folders (FEF)].
      1.2.9.2. Be responsible for completion of training requirements and currencies within the
      guidelines of this volume and applicable RAP tasking message.
      1.2.9.3. Not participate in flying activities for which they are not trained, qualified, or
      current unless under appropriate supervision.
1.3. Processing Changes:
   1.3.1. Process changes using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication,
   IAW AFI 33-360 and AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program (FMP), through local and
   MAJCOM training channels to ACC/A3CA. ACC/A3CA will forward (coordinated)
   recommended changes to USAF/A3O-AT for approval.
1.4. Training. Aircrew training is designed to progress aircrew from Initial Qualification
Training (IQT) (Basic Course or Re-Qualification Training (RQT)) to Mission Qualification
Training (MQT) and finally to Continuation Training (CT).
   1.4.1. IQT provides the training necessary to initially qualify aircrew in a basic crew position
   to perform flying duties without regard to the unit’s mission. See Chapter 2. Upon
   completion of IQT, aircrew attains Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) status.
      1.4.1.1. BAQ aircrew have completed a flight evaluation and are qualified to perform
      basic aircrew duties in the E-3. Squadron CC/DOs will carefully choose those missions
      on which BAQ aircrew may fly unsupervised. BAQ aircrew will only perform those
      duties for which they have been trained and qualified. With appropriate supervision,
      BAQ aircrew may participate in composite force or other advanced scenarios.
      1.4.1.2. BAQ is a prerequisite for MQT.
      1.4.1.3. Except for General Officers, BAQ is not a long-term qualification status and
      waiver authority to remain BAQ resides with MAJCOM/A3.
   1.4.2. MQT provides aircrew the advanced training necessary to qualify in an assigned
   aircrew position to perform the command or unit mission. See Chapter 3. Aircrew will
   maintain BAQ status until completion of MQT. Completion of MQT is a prerequisite for
   CMR/BMC. See Chapter 4.
   1.4.3. CT provides aircrew with the volume, frequency, and mix of training necessary to
   maintain proficiency in the assigned qualification level. RAP is the CT program designed to
   focus training toward needed skills. Specific RAP instructions are issued by each MAJCOM
   via a RAP tasking message. See Chapter 4.
   1.4.4. Aircrew will have received training in all basic missions of a specific unit upon
   completion of IQT and MQT. Aircrew will then be designated either CMR or BMC.
      1.4.4.1. CMR. CMR aircrew will maintain proficiency and qualification in all core
      missions of the flying unit to which they are assigned or attached. CMR aircrew will
      maintain currencies which affect CMR status, accomplish all core designated flight
      training (sorties and events), and all mission ground training. Failure to complete this
10                                                           AFI11-2E-3V1 6 AUGUST 2012


     training or maintain these currencies results in regression to Non-CMR (N-CMR) status.
     These currencies and events are outlined in Chapter 4 and applicable RAP Tasking
     memorandum.
     1.4.4.2. BMC. BMC designated aircrew members have a primary job performing wing
     supervision or staff functions that directly support the flying mission. These aircrew are
     required to provide additional sortie generation capability, either in lieu of or in addition
     to, the personnel assigned to the flying squadrons. See Chapter 4.
        1.4.4.2.1. BMC aircrew will maintain familiarization with all unit core missions.
        They may also maintain proficiency and qualification in some of the unit core
        missions. BMC aircrew must be able to attain CMR qualification in 30 days or less.
        1.4.4.2.2. BMC aircrew will accomplish all mission-related ground training
        designated by their attached SQ/CC. BMC aircrew may deploy and may participate
        in any mission for which they are proficient and qualified, without additional training,
        as determined by the SQ/CC.
        1.4.4.2.3. Failure to complete BMC required training results in regression to Non-
        BMC (N-BMC) status. While N-BMC, aircrew will not perform combat training
        without supervision until re-certified.
     1.4.4.3. API-6/8/C/D rated personnel flying authorizations, Career Enlisted Aviator
     (CEA) flying authorizations, nonrated MAJCOM Realistic Training Program aircrew,
     USAFWS assigned instructors, and test aircrew are managed IAW AFI 11-202V1,
     Aircrew Training, and MAJCOM guidance.
        1.4.4.3.1. These aircrew members require a valid AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew
        Qualification, IAW AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program,
        and AFI 11-2E3V2, E-3 Aircrew Evaluation Criteria.
        1.4.4.3.2. These aircrew members will fly the BMC rate; however, they are not
        required to complete BMC specific ATD events nor maintain lookback requirements.
        1.4.4.3.3. If these aircrew members are current, they may fly without an instructor
        with SQ/CC or DO concurrence.
        1.4.4.3.4. These aircrew members are exempt from academic ground training,
        chemical warfare (CW) training, and special training programs (except when required
        in preparation for theater deployment). These personnel must complete Category I
        ground training events IAW paragraph 4.10.1. These aircrew will also complete
        SS02, SS05, and CRM of Category II training. CAT III training is not required.
     1.4.4.4. Unqualified (UQ). Unqualified aircrew members require a flight evaluation
     before progressing to a higher qualification level. UQ aircrew members fall under one or
     more of the following categories:
        1.4.4.4.1. Enrolled in IQT.
        1.4.4.4.2. Downgraded for being Non-Current greater than 6 months.
        1.4.4.4.3. Downgraded for a demonstrated lack of ability.
AFI11-2E-3V1 6 AUGUST 2012                                                               11


         1.4.4.4.4. Downgraded for failure to meet standards during a QUAL flight evaluation
         or at SQ/CC discretion following a Commander-directed downgrade IAW AFI 11-
         202 Vol 2
     1.4.4.5. Returning personnel currently qualified in a non-USAF E-3 aircraft require
     difference training. See paragraph 5.7
     1.4.4.6. Aircrew Experience Level. Aircrew Experience Levels tell unit commanders
     how much flying and Aircrew Training Device (ATD) training CMR and BMC aircrew
     members need to maintain RAP requirements. There are two Experience Levels for
     aircrew members who receive CMR/BMC qualification--" Inexperienced" and
     "Experienced."
         1.4.4.6.1. Assigning Experience/Inexperience Levels.         Aircrew training cycle
         requirements are based on the aircrew member’s current "experienced" or
         "inexperienced" status. When an aircrew member changes experience levels, training
         requirements will be prorated from the date of experience certification.
  1.4.4.7. Experience Level Progression. SQ/CCs may reclassify CMR/BMC aircrew
  members as "experienced" based on successfully completing a unit-developed ―experienced‖
  certification program and the progression guidelines in paragraph 1.4.4.9. SQ/CCs may
  waive the progression guidelines based on demonstrated proficiency. Squadron DOT
  documents reclassification as "Combat Mission Ready/Experienced or Basic Mission
  Capable/Experienced" in Section II of the aircrew member’s training record.
     1.4.4.8. Normal Progression Guidelines for Combat Mission Ready Experienced
     (CMR/E).

          have 350 E-3 flying hours as a CMR crewmember in their current position and have
          been CMR for 1 Year.
   1.4.5. Upgrade/Specialized Training. Upgrade/Specialized training is training in any
   special skills necessary to carry out the unit’s assigned mission that is not required by every
   aircrew. See Chapter 5. Upgrade/Specialized training is normally accomplished after an
   aircrew is assigned CMR/BMC status and is normally in addition to CMR/BMC
   requirements. Unless otherwise specified, CMR/BMC aircrew members may hold special
   capabilities/qualifications as long as any additional training requirements are accomplished.
      1.4.5.1. Instructor/Evaluator Qualified. Instructor/evaluator qualified aircrew members
      are trained and qualified to instruct and/or evaluate duties associated with their aircrew
      positions. Instructor/evaluator certified aircrew members will maintain CMR/BMC
      status. Instructors may perform instructor duties in-flight as long as they are CMR/BMC
      and current in the event they are instructing. Instructors who become N-CMR/N-BMC
      may be allowed to continue academic and/or ATD instructor duties with 552 OG/CC, 513
      ACG/CC, 3 OG/CC, or 18 OG/CC or equivalent approval.
1.5. Training Concepts and Policies:
   1.5.1. Training programs will be designed to achieve the highest degree of combat readiness
   consistent with flight safety and resource availability. Training must balance the need for
   realism against the expected threat, aircrew capabilities, and safety. This volume provides
   training guidelines and policies to be used with operational procedures specified in applicable
   flying/operations publications.
   1.5.2. HQ ACC Training Support Squadron (TRSS) will develop and validate training
   programs when/where tasked.
   1.5.3. Training missions will be designed to achieve combat capability in squadron tasked
   roles, maintain proficiency, and enhance mission accomplishment and safety. RAP training
   missions should emphasize either basic combat skills, or scenarios that reflect procedures and
   operations based on employment plans, location, current intelligence, and opposition
   capabilities. Use procedures and actions applicable to combat scenarios (i.e. appropriate use
   of code words, authentication procedures, combat tactics, safe recovery procedures, tactical
   deception, in-flight reports, threat reactions, intel briefing and debriefing).
   1.5.4. In-flight Supervision:
AFI11-2E-3V1 6 AUGUST 2012                                                                     13


      1.5.4.1. The following personnel must be under the direct supervision of an
      instructor/evaluator when performing aircrew duties.
          1.5.4.1.1. Unqualified aircrew members.
          1.5.4.1.2. Aircrew members performing events in which they are noncurrent or
          unqualified. Note: Pilots may fly unsupervised while non-current for night landing
          and night air refueling on sorties planned not to include night operations or autopilot-
          off air refueling when AAR is not planned with SQ/DO approval. IPs may fly
          unsupervised while non-current for touch and go landings on sorties planned not to
          include this event with SQ/DO approval.
          1.5.4.1.3. Aircrew members performing MQT sorties, except as permitted in
          Chapter 3.
          1.5.4.1.4. Aircrew members downgraded to N-CMR/N-BMC.
          1.5.4.1.5. Any senior officer who has not completed IQT requirements of Chapter 2
          including an appropriate flight evaluation.
1.6. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) Policy and Management:
   1.6.1. AWACS units are scheduled to Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) pairs however, their
   Low Supply/High Demand status drives one common 12-month RAP cycle for all units.
   Each RAP qualification level is defined by a total number of RAP sorties, broken down into
   mission types, plus specific qualifications and associated events as determined by the
   MAJCOM and unit commanders.
   1.6.2. The total number of CMR and BMC RAP sorties accomplished is the primary factor
   for maintaining an individual’s qualification level. A review of the RAP sorties flown should
   also consider specific sortie and mission types. Variations may be used as a basis for
   regression by the SQ/CC. Qualification in a mission is determined by the SQ/CC
   considering the MAJCOM guidance and the individual’s capabilities.
   1.6.3. The SQ/CC’s first priority should be to train all designated aircrew to CMR.
   1.6.4. Progression from BMC to CMR requires:
      1.6.4.1. A 1-month lookback at CMR sortie rate.
      1.6.4.2. Qualification in all missions and any specialized mission training required for
      CMR.
      1.6.4.3. Completion of mission-related ground training.
      1.6.4.4. Squadron CC certification.
   1.6.5. CMR aircrew members should fly the required monthly sortie rate to achieve
   lookback. See Table 4.5. Requirements for lookback are described in paragraph 4.8.2.
1.7. Training Program Development:
   1.7.1. RAP Tasking memorandum sortie and event requirements apply to CMR and BMC
   aircrew as well as those carrying special capabilities or qualifications. The current RAP
   Tasking memorandum takes precedence over this volume and may contain updated
   requirements, sorties, missions, definitions, or events not yet incorporated into this volume.
 14                                                            AFI11-2E-3V1 6 AUGUST 2012


   The standard sortie requirements establish the minimum number of sorties per training cycle
   for each of the following levels of training:
       1.7.1.1. BMC. The minimum training required for aircrew to be familiar in all, and may
       be qualified and proficient in some, of the primary missions tasked to their assigned unit
       and weapons system.
       1.7.1.2. CMR. The minimum training required for aircrew to be qualified and proficient
       in all of the primary missions tasked to their assigned unit and weapons system.
   1.7.2. Collateral or ―Cost of Business‖ sortie requirements will be considered when
   developing unit flying hour programs. These sorties are not directly related to combat
   employment training but are necessary in day-to-day unit operations. These sorties or
   requirements include but are not limited to ferry flights, incentive flights, deployments, and
   air shows.
   1.7.3. Unit flying hour programs are allocated a number of attrition sorties that compensate
   for non-effective training sorties. Non-effective sorties are logged when a training sortie,
   RAP or Non-RAP, is planned, but a major portion of valid training for that type of mission is
   not accomplished due to poor weather, air aborts, etc. It is essential that non-effective sorties
   are logged appropriately for HHQ to accurately allocate the number of attrition sorties each
   year.
1.8. Training Records and Reports. Units will maintain aircrew records for individual
training and evaluations IAW AFI 11-202V1, AFI 11-202V2, AFI 11-401, AFI 33-360, and
appropriate MAJCOM directives.
   1.8.1. Units will document and maintain aircrew certification/upgrade training in individual
   training folders IAW AFI 33-360 using AF Form 4324, Aircraft Assignment/Aircrew
   Qualification Worksheet, and the 552 OG Form 52, Aircrew Certification, or PACAF/AFRC
   unit equivalents.
   1.8.2. Units will prepare and forward training reports IAW MAJCOM directives and current
   RAP Tasking memorandum.
   1.8.3. Units using ARMS will maintain flying and ground training records IAW AFI 11-401
   and MAJCOM supplements. When documenting aircrew training in ARMS, use AF Form
   1522, ARMS Additional Training Accomplishment Input, or a locally developed Mission
   Accomplishment Report (MAR) that adheres to AFI 11-421, Aviation Resource
   Management, and AFI 33-360 for guidance.
   1.8.4. Track the following information for all aircrew (as applicable):
       1.8.4.1. Ground training.
       1.8.4.2. Requirements and accomplishment of individual sorties, RAP sorties, sortie
       types, and events cumulatively for the training cycle.
       1.8.4.3. RAP sortie requirements and accomplishment using 1-month and 3-month
       running totals for look-back.
       1.8.4.4. Currencies.

   1.9.1. Commanders will ensure aircrew fill authorized positions IAW unit manning
   documents and aircrew status is properly designated. The overall objective is that aircrews
   perform combat-related duties.
   1.9.2. Supervisors may assign aircrew to valid, short-term tasks (escort officer, FEB/mishap
   board member, etc.), but must continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of
   aircrew tasking, flying proficiency, currency, and experience.
   1.9.3. For inexperienced aircrew, supervisors will limit the non-flying duties to those related
   to combat training activities.
   1.9.4. Aircrew will not perform long-term duties that detract from their primary duties of
   training for, or performing, the unit flying mission.
1.10. Sortie Allocation Guidance:
   1.10.1. Inexperienced aircrew members should receive sortie allocation priority over
   experienced aircrew members. Priorities for sortie allocation are as follows:
      1.10.1.1. Formal Training Units. Formal syllabus training, Instructor Upgrade, Instructor
      CT, authorized staff personnel not performing Instructor or SEFE duties.
      1.10.1.2. Operational Units. CMR, MQT, then BMC.

   currency in an event, that event must be graded to a level ―2‖ or above as specified by ACCI
   11-464. Currencies established/updated during the flight phase of the evaluation, must be
   graded ―Q‖ or ―Q-― with no additional training assigned as specified by AFI 11-202V2.
4.5. Theater (Deployment) Training.
   4.5.1. IAW AFI 11-202V1, all CMR/BMC aircrew members will complete applicable
   theater training prior to assuming operational duties within that theater.
   4.5.2. A certification brief will be given by the deploying crew to a squadron board. The
   squadron board should, at a minimum, consist of the CC/CD (or a designated representative)
   and representatives from squadron weapons and tactics (DOW).
   4.5.3. Battle Director Technicians (BDTs) do not require NORAD Theater Training.
4.6. Logging of CT Requirements by Instructors/Evaluators.
   4.6.1. Instructors/Evaluators will perform training events IAW the current RAP Tasking
   Message.
   4.6.2. IPs will control the aircraft to credit a training event. Note: IPs may log a touch and
   go when supervising a touch and go from either pilot seat.
   4.6.3. USAFWS instructors using NAWCS/TDF may credit all controlling events while
   performing instructor/evaluator duties.
   4.6.4. SDs will not log controlled missions for solely supervising AWOs or WDs engaged in
   aircraft control. In order to log a controlled mission, SDs must meet the provisions of
   paragraph 4.12.3.2.2.2 or perform instructor duties in the area of controlled mission under
   the provisions of paragraph 4.12.3.2.2.3.
4.7. Proration of End-of-Cycle Requirements. At the end of the training cycle, the SQ/CC
may prorate all training requirements when DNIFs, emergency leaves, non-flying
TDY/exercises, combat/contingency deployments or operations, preclude training for a portion
of the training period. Normal annual leave will not be considered as non-availability.
   4.7.1. Contingency Operations. Contingency operations can have a positive or negative
   impact on a unit's CT program, as emphasis is on supporting the actual contingency. A
   potential lack of training opportunities while supporting contingency operations can place a
   burden on the unit, forcing it to accomplish the majority of its CT program in a reduced
   period of time or with reduced assets. The following proration procedures are intended to
   provide flexibility in accomplishing the unit's CT program:
   4.7.2. Normally all missions flown during contingency operations will be logged as
   contingency operations sorties. These sorties do not count toward total RAP requirements,
   but may be used for lookback purposes. RAP events logged during contingency operations
   sorties do not count toward total RAP requirements, but may be used to update currencies.
   Units may prorate RAP sorties/events for the period of time (cumulative) each individual was
   tasked for contingency operations. Proration must occur at the end of the training cycle. In
 22                                                           AFI11-2E-3V1 6 AUGUST 2012


   addition, proration is authorized for the deployment preparation and deployment recovery
   time where home station flying is reduced by the MAJCOM.
   4.7.3. Proration is based on cumulative days of non-availability in the training cycle. Use
   Table 4.6 to determine the number of months to be prorated. The number of months an
   aircrew member is not available for flying or ATD duties is entered into the Aviation
   Resource Management System (ARMS) which determines the prorated requirements.
   4.7.4. Mission aircrew members start continuation training the month following completion
   of MQT and receiving initial CMR/BMC certification. Training accomplished during
   IQT/MQT will not be counted toward continuation training requirements.
4.8. CMR/BMC Regression. N-CMR/N-BMC aircrew members are not authorized to perform
aircrew duties unless under instructor/evaluator supervision, except as noted in paragraph 1.5.4
Downgraded aircrew members must be recertified, in writing, by their squadron commander or
designated representative.
   4.8.1. Aircrew shall be regressed to N-CMR/N-BMC for one or more of the following
   reasons:
       4.8.1.1. Failure to complete Category I and II ground training requirements. Note: If
       downgraded for failure to meet Category II ground training requirements (except GA06--
       Crew Resource Management (CRM), per AFI 11-202V1), the member will have the same
       status as a BAQ aircrew member as defined in paragraph 1.4.1
       4.8.1.2. Failure to meet lookback IAW paragraph 4.8.2. Note: CMR aircrew only.
       4.8.1.3. Failure to complete recurring/RAP training cycle flying training requirements.
       4.8.1.4. Failure to meet AFI 11-202V1 requirements not covered above.
       4.8.1.5. Receiving an overall ―Q3‖ grade on an INSTM, QUAL, or MSN evaluation
       IAW AFI 11-202V2.
       4.8.1.6. At SQ/CC discretion.
   4.8.2. Lookback. Both 1-month and 3-month sortie lookback periods will be calculated on
   the first duty day of each month. See Figure 4.1 for lookback flow chart. Squadron
   commanders will determine the RAP level flown, see Table 4.5, by first using the 1-month
   lookback period. If the 1-month lookback is not satisfied then the 3-month window will be
   examined. Note: Lookback does not apply to BMC or BAQ aircrew.
       4.8.2.1. Failure to Meet 1-Month Lookback. If a CMR aircrew member does not meet
       their RAP 1-month lookback requirements, a review will be made of their RAP 3-month
       lookback requirements. If the 3-month lookback has been met, aircrew may, at SQ/CC
       discretion, remain in CMR status.
       4.8.2.2. Failure to Meet 3-Month Lookback. If an aircrew member fails to meet the 3-
       month lookback requirement, SQ/CCs may:
           4.8.2.2.1. Regress the aircrew member to N-CMR status; or,
           4.8.2.2.2. Remove the aircrew member from a CMR manning position; or,
           4.8.2.2.3. Initiate action to remove the aircrew member from active flying status; or
AFI11-2E-3V1 6 AUGUST 2012                                                                    23


           4.8.2.2.4. Place aircrew in probation status for 1 month (30 days). If SQ/CC chooses
           probation, the aircrew member will reestablish a 1-month lookback at the end of the
           probation period to remain CMR. Probation status will be documented in the
           individual’s training folder.
       4.8.2.3. Aircrew members that regress to N-CMR status for lookback for less than 180
       days will complete a SQ/CC approved re-certification program to return the aircrew
       member to CMR status. Note: At a minimum, the SQ/CC training plan should consist of
       sorties equaling 1-month’s RAP requirement.
           4.8.2.3.1. Aircrew will complete an approved training plan prior to regaining CMR
           status (see para 4.8.2.3). Elapsed time between re-certification sorties shall be no
           greater than 30 days. In addition, 1-month lookback will start the first full month of
           CMR status. The sorties and events accomplished during their recertification
           program may be credited towards their total sortie and event requirements for the
           training cycle as well as for their monthly sortie requirement.
           4.8.2.3.2. Following recertification to CMR status, aircrew members will meet a 1-
           month lookback to maintain CMR until a 3-month lookback is established. SQ/CCs
           may apply probation rules, as described in paragraph 4.8.2.2.4.
       4.8.2.4. Lookback computations for new aircrew members begin following completion
       of MQT. In addition, 1-month lookback will start the first full month of CMR status.
       New aircrew members who have been CMR less than 3 months will meet 1-month
       lookback to remain CMR until a 3-month lookback is established. SQ/CCs may apply
       probation rules, as described in paragraph 4.8.2.2.4, if a new CMR aircrew member fails
       to meet 1-month lookback while establishing 3-month lookback.
   4.8.3. Aircrew members who fail to complete their RAP requirements for their prescribed
   RAP training cycle are downgraded to N-CMR/N-BMC. Unless waived IAW paragraph
   4.4, recurring training requirements require make-up during the next RAP training cycle.
   Accomplishment of any delinquent training is tracked manually and documented in the
   aircrew member’s training records.
4.9. Dual Qualifications. For the purpose of this paragraph, dual qualification is qualification
in two different crew positions in the same MDS. The purpose of dual qualifications is to
provide commanders with flexibility in meeting local training requirements on a case-by-case
basis.
   4.9.1. Unit commanders may dual qualify aircrew members based upon an individual's
   experience, training history and availability of training opportunities.
   4.9.2. In all instances, dual qualified individuals will maintain CMR status in their primary
   crew position, as determined by the unit commander.
   4.9.3. These individuals may also maintain CMR in both qualifications as long as full RAP
   requirements are met for each qualification. Alternately, the individual may assume BMC
   status in their secondary crew position.
4.10. Ground Training. Ground training requirements are divided into three categories.
Category I includes mission-essential ground training which must be completed in order to fly.
Category II contains general flying-related ground training requirements that affect RAP status.

        training events IAW the applicable RAP tasking message(s).
        4.11.2.3.3. Currency Requirements. All flight crewmembers complete the applicable
        training events listed in Table 4.2 and Table 4.3 in the specified time period. Note:
        Pilots may fly unsupervised while non-current for night landing and night air
        refueling on sorties planned not to include night operations or autopilot-off air
        refueling when AAR is not planned with SQ/DO approval. IPs may fly unsupervised
        while non-current for touch and go landings on sorties planned not to include this
        event with SQ/DO approval.
            4.11.2.3.3.1. Takeoff, Instrument Approach, Landing, Night Landing, Touch and
            Go Landing, Air Refueling, and Night Air Refueling event currencies may be
            updated or regained in the E-3 OFT with the following restrictions:
               4.11.2.3.3.1.1. Events must be accomplished under the supervision of an
               USAF/CF/RAAF IP/SEFE or government contractor.
               4.11.2.3.3.1.2. Multiple currency updates may be accomplished in the E-3
               OFT within the previously established aircraft currency window. The last
               OFT currency update within the aircraft currency window is used to calculate
               the new currency date. For example, if a pilot logs a takeoff in the aircraft on
               1 Apr, his or her aircraft currency would expire on 16 May. The pilot could
               fly multiple sims during this 45-day period. The pilot flies their last sim on 14
               May (still within the original aircraft established currency) and subsequently
               updates his or her currency to 28 June. Prior to 28 June, the currency must be
               updated in the aircraft in order to avoid going non-current.
               4.11.2.3.3.1.3. A lost currency may be regained in the OFT provided the time
               elapsed since the last time the event was performed in the aircraft is not more
               than two times the currency period and the event is conducted under the
               supervision of a USAF/CF/RAAF IP/SEFE or government contractor. When
               a lost currency is regained in the OFT, the subsequent update must be in the
               aircraft.
            4.11.2.3.3.2. Nav Air Refueling Rendezvous currency may be updated or
            regained in the NPTT provided the time elapsed since the last time the event was
            performed in the aircraft is not more than two times the currency period and the
            event is conducted under the supervision of a USAF/IN/EN or government
AFI11-2E-3V1 6 AUGUST 2012                                                                   29


             contractor. When a lost currency is regained in the NPTT, the subsequent update
             must be in the aircraft.
  4.11.3. Criteria for Training Events:
     4.11.3.1. Aircrew Training Device. AC, CP, FP and FE. The flight crew ATD
     contractor training program is designed and administered IAW the FCT contract. Pilots

         4.11.3.1.1. Scenario Simulator. Three-hour Simulation Scenarios include normal and
         emergency procedures IAW operational flight trainer CTD. An effective simulator
         sortie accomplishes a minimum of 75% of the training objectives. To credit a
         Scenario Simulator event, both pilot positions and the FE position will be occupied.
         4.11.3.1.2. Pilot Proficiency Simulator. Three-hour Pilot Proficiency Simulators
         emphasize normal, instrument, and emergency procedures transition training and air
         refueling events IAW operational flight trainer Course Training Documents. The
         Pilot Proficiency Simulator must be accomplished in the E-3 OFT and under
         government Contractor or USAF/CF/RAAF IP supervision. An effective simulator is
         one that a minimum of 75 percent of training objectives was accomplished. To credit
         a Pilot Proficiency event, both pilot positions and the FE position will be occupied.
         Note: Either a FE or government contractor may occupy the FE position.
     4.11.3.2. Flying Training. The requirements for effective training sorties for each crew
     position are as follows:

             4.11.3.2.1.2. The criteria stated above are minimums. The lead instructor pilot on
             the sortie will determine if the activity was of sufficient training value for the
             individual to log a pilot proficiency event. Instructors should tailor each
             proficiency sortie to the individual pilot's needs. Particular emphasis should be
             placed on simulated systems malfunctions, simulated-engine out operations, and
             instrument procedures. IPs will have individuals repeat maneuvers until proficient

           uses appropriate tracking methods to accomplish tactical tracking taskings.
           During tactical tracking, the SST will ensure ASTs correctly use ID matrix and
           assist as required. SST will monitor applicable fighter frequencies whenever
           possible.
           4.12.3.2.6.5. Qualified ISSTs can instruct and supervise qualified or unqualified
           surveillance crew positions other than their own (i.e. IASTs, or ASTs).
        4.12.3.2.7. AST:
           4.12.3.2.7.1. Event operation. The AST performs assigned duties with the radar,
           IFF or ESM declared operational and the E-3 declared ops normal or on-station.
           4.12.3.2.7.2. EA/EP. AST performs primary duties with the Radar or IFF
           systems degraded by jamming from an external source. Mutual interference from
           another E-3 is not considered an external EA source and does not constitute credit
           for EA/EP. EA/EP ATD can be logged when a live/DMO EA/EP event occurs.
           PACAF can substitute 2sim EA/EP events for only 1 live event per RAP cycle.
           4.12.3.2.7.3. Tactical Tracking. ASTs will track at least two maneuvering targets
           (red or blue air) through detection, pre-merge and post-merge from check-in to
           handoff (if controlled). The surveillance section must generate an ID Matrix and
           prosecute all aircraft IAW this matrix to include coordination with the MCC, SD
           and other relevant agencies. As a minimum, ASTs must monitor applicable
           fighter frequencies, follow the tracking plan and execute the ID plan in
           coordination with the SST, ASO, ECO, and MCC as applicable.
              4.12.3.2.7.3.1. Swapping Trackers.        An AST may hand off tracking
              responsibility to another AST so that more than one individual may log a
              tactical tracking event for a single set of activity. During the flight, the SST
              and ASO will determine whether the mission activity is of sufficient quality
              and duration to provide adequate training for more than one tracker.
        4.12.3.2.8. CDMT:
           4.12.3.2.8.1. System Check. CDMT operates, maintains, or troubleshoots the
           computer and associated systems in-flight to support mission requirements. The
           E-3 does not need to declare ops normal or on-station to credit a System Check.
           Performs primary CDMT duties during approximately 50 percent of the mission.
           4.12.3.2.8.2. DPS DMP. CDMT operates DPS DMP in-flight. This requirement
           may be accomplished in the ATD on a one for one basis.
           4.12.3.2.8.3. CPS DMP. CDMT operates CPS DMP in-flight.
        4.12.3.2.9. ART:
           4.12.3.2.9.1. System Check. ART operates, maintains, or troubleshoots sensor
           systems in-flight to support mission requirements. The E-3 does not need to be
           declared on-station or ops normal to credit a System Check. Performs primary
           ART duties during approximately 50 percent of the mission.

4.13. Flight Surgeons. IAW AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew Training, give assigned and attached
flight surgeons every opportunity to fly in the unit’s primary mission aircraft.
   4.13.1. Flight surgeons will complete the following:
      4.13.1.1. Flight physical IAW AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards.
      4.13.1.2. Physiological training IAW AFI 11-403, Aerospace Physiological Training
      Program.
      4.13.1.3. Life support and ground egress training IAW Table 4.1 of this volume. Note:
      MDS-specific guidance IAW AFI 11-301V1, Aircrew Flight Equipment Program.
      4.13.1.4. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM/GA06/XGA06) is a 2-year
      requirement.
   4.13.2. Flight surgeon sortie and currency requirements will be IAW AFI 11-202V1.
4.14. Currencies/Recurrency/Requalification.
AFI11-2E-3V1 6 AUGUST 2012                                                                     39


  4.14.1. Currency. See Table 4.2, Table 4.3, Table 4.4, and the RAP Tasking Message for
  currency requirements for all crew positions. If an aircrew member loses a particular
  currency, that sortie/event may not be performed except for the purpose of regaining
  currency as noted. Instructors will be qualified and current in all events they are instructing.
  4.14.2. Recurrency. Recurrency guidelines are IAW AFI 11-202V1.
     4.14.2.1. Overdue training requirements will be accomplished before the aircrew
     member is considered qualified to perform tasks applicable to that type of training.
     Training annotated as affecting CMR/BMC status will require regression until
     appropriate training as specified by SQ/CC is accomplished. Training identified as not
     affecting CMR status does not require regression, but may affect crewmember’s
     deployment status. The duration of grounding and status of sortie lookback will
     determine the effect on CMR status.           The currency will be regained under
     instructor/evaluator supervision. See Table 4.7 and Table 4.8. Note: Flight surgeons
     may satisfy this requirement by successfully re-accomplishing the annual flight surgeon
     qualification examination.
     4.14.2.2. Aircrew members regressed to N-CMR/N-BMC or grounded for expiration of
     ground training currencies will complete any delinquent ground training IAW reference
     directive as part of the SQ/CC directed training plan. See Table 4.1 and paragraph
     4.10.
     4.14.2.3. Dual Qualified CSO/CT will perform delinquent training for the position in
     which recurrency is required.
  4.14.3. Requalification. Follow guidance IAW AFI11-202V1, applicable MAJCOM
  supplement, and this instruction.
     4.14.3.1. Requalification training is used to requalify former E-3 crewmembers returning
     to fly mission aircraft, to requalify crewmembers that have become unqualified due to
     loss of currency (exceeding 6 months), or due to a downgrade by the squadron
     commander for demonstrated lack of ability. An aircrew member is unqualified upon
     either loss of currency exceeding 6 months or expiration of their qualification check,
     whichever occurs first.
     4.14.3.2. Aircrew members that regress to N-CMR/ status for lookback will follow
     guidance in paragraph 4.8.2. Aircrew members that regress to N-CMR/N-BMC for
     failure to meet their end of cycle RAP requirements will follow guidance in paragraph
     4.8.3.
     4.14.3.3. Requalification requirements listed in Table 4.7 or Table 4.8 will be completed
     when applicable. The date used to calculate whether or not a formal training course is
     required for re-qualification will be the date of the individual’s last flight.
     4.14.3.4. Dual Qualified CSO/CT will perform delinquent training for the position in
     which requalification is required.
     4.14.3.5. Aircrew members downgraded to UQ for a demonstrated lack of ability must
     complete remedial training prescribed by the SQ/CC and fly at least once under
     Instructor/SEFE supervision.
 40                                                           AFI11-2E-3V1 6 AUGUST 2012


      4.14.3.6. Instructors who become unqualified must be nominated by their squadron
      commander prior to starting instructor requalification training.
      4.14.3.7. Basic and instructor requalification may be conducted simultaneously.
      Reference AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2E-3V2 for guidance on simultaneous instructor
      requalification and basic requalification evaluations.
   4.14.3.8. Reserve AWACS aircrew members fall under the Tier 2 Expeditionary Skills (ES)
   Training Cycle and will meet those requirements prior to deployment.

                         UPGRADE/SPECIALIZED TRAINING

5.1. General. This chapter establishes the minimum eligibility criteria and the training
requirements for upgrade and specialized training.
5.2. Requirements. Upgrade training requirements provide aircrew members with the
academic, ATD, and/or flying training needed to attain a higher level of E-3 aircrew
qualification.
5.3. Waivers/Extensions. 552 OG/CC, 513 ACG/CC, 3 OG/CC, and 18 OG/CC or designated
representative has waiver authority for upgrade requirements/prerequisites. PACAF/AFRC
squadron commanders may extend UGT course duration by up to 30 training days.
5.4. Instructor Upgrade. Instructor Aircrew Upgrade Training prepares aircrew members for
qualification as an instructor in their present crew position.
   5.4.1. OG/OST will maintain executive oversight of each squadron instructor program.
   Differences between squadron programs or discrepancies in squadron-level programs should
   be addressed and resolved at the lowest level possible, but OG/CDT retains final authority
   for program resolution and implementation.
      5.4.1.1. Individual squadron and In-House Instructor Upgrade Programs should include,
      as a minimum, documentation for instructor recommendation (memorandum for record
      by Flight CC or instructor of like position; Forms 206 may be used as a substitute).
      5.4.1.2. The candidate instructor should receive a mix of live fly and simulator flights
      with a qualified instructor. Squadron DOT offices and commanders should evaluate the
      candidate’s proficiency and demonstrated performance and document a regimented
      training outline prior to initiating instructor upgrades. All academic, ATD, and flight
      training will be IAW ACC approved Course Control Documents.
   5.4.2. Non-Waiverable Prerequisites. All crewmembers must be rated as experienced in
   their current aircrew position. Enlisted crewmembers must also hold a 5-Skill Level.
   5.4.3. Prerequisites. The following additional prerequisites may be used by squadron
   commanders as a guide to nominate crewmembers for instructor upgrade.
      5.4.3.1. IP candidates have 300 hours as a CMR/BMC E-3 Aircraft Commander.
      5.4.3.2. IFE candidates have achieved the rank of at least E-4.
      5.4.3.3. IBDT candidates have a minimum of 300 hours as a CMR/BMC BDT and have
      flown two live NORAD exercises.
      5.4.3.4. USAFWS graduates  may      be    recommended     for   Instructor
      MCC/SD/AWO/ASO/ECO upgrade after accumulating a minimum of 200 hours as a
      CMR/BMC crewmember and exhibiting necessary E-3 system and equipment
      knowledge.
      5.4.3.5. ICSO, ICT, IART, and ICDMT candidates have a minimum of 500 E-3 flying
      hours while CMR/BMC in their crew position.

Terms
Aircrew—The complete complement of flight and mission crew personnel required to fly an
operational mission.
Aircrew Duties—Duties which directly contribute to accomplishing E-3 mission objectives.
Failure by any aircrew member to properly perform their assigned aircrew duties can result in an
unsuccessful E-3 mission.
 58                                                           AFI11-2E-3V1 6 AUGUST 2012


Basic Mission Capable (BMC)—A crewmember who requires further training prior to being
certified to perform tactical duties in support of E-3 roles and missions defined in AFTTP 3-
1V15. BMC crewmembers have completed MQT but do not maintain CMR status due to staff
duty assignment or other reasons as determined by the appropriate authority.
Combat Mission Ready (CMR)—A crewmember who has been trained and certified to perform
tactical duties in support of E-3 roles and missions defined in AFTTP 3-1 AWACS.
Composite Force Training (CFT)—Training that includes two or more aircraft types
performing two or more mission roles (e.g., F-15s providing escort for F-16s performing air
interdiction). CFT exercises vary in complexity and size from smaller ORE/ORIs to RED FLAG
scenarios.
Continuation Training (CT)—Flying and ATD training designed to maintain proficiency and
improve crewmember capabilities.
Difference Training—Training required for returning aircrew members currently qualified in an
E-3 aircraft with airframe/mission equipment configurations different from the standard USAF
E-3 configuration.
Flight Crew—The aircraft commander, co-pilot, navigator, and flight engineer.
Initial Qualification Training (IQT)—Prepares aircrew members to perform non-tactical duties
in the aircraft. Training is conducted IAW approved syllabi. Graduates of IQT are awarded
Basic Qualification (N-CMR/N-BMC) status after successful completion of an ACC/PACAF
evaluation (AFI 11-2E3 V2).
Instructor—CMR/BMC qualified aircrew member who has been trained to provide instruction
in their crew position.
Minimum Requirements—The minimum level to which a crewmember can be trained to
maintain MR/BMC status.
Mission Crew—Those individuals responsible for the command, control, surveillance, and
communications/electronic/management functions to include the control and monitoring of
assigned aircraft, sensor management, internal and external communications management, and
onboard systems management.
Mission Qualification Training (MQT)—Prepares aircrew members to perform tactical duties
in support of unit tasking. Graduates of MQT are certified CMR/BMC by the squadron
commander.
Non-Combat Mission Ready (N-CMR/N-BMC)—A crewmember who has completed IQT and
passed initial ACC/PACAF evaluation (AFI 11-2E3 V2), but is not certified to perform tactical
duties in support of E-3 roles and missions as defined in AFTTP 3-1 AWACS.
Non-Tactical Duties—Duties involving basic operation of the aircraft and aircraft systems.
These operations do not include tactical applications of wartime or contingency skills (e.g., non-
tactical duties for pilots would include takeoff and landing, but would not include knowledge or
proficiency in AFTTP 3-1 threat neutralization tactics).
Operational Mission—E-3 mission with primary objectives supporting higher headquarters
tasked surveillance and/or control.
AFI11-2E-3V1 6 AUGUST 2012                                                                   59


Positional Aircrew Upgrade Training—Prepares crewmembers to perform duties in a higher
level crew position.
Tactical Duties—Those duties that would be performed in a contingency or wartime operations.
These duties vary by crew position, are trained during MQT, and may be performed for training
purposes during peacetime CONUS or overseas sorties (e.g., performance of duties wearing
CWD equipment or control of intercepts during air defense operations).
Training Mission—E-3 mission with primary objectives of completion of E-3 aircrew member
training and/or support of other participating unit’s training.
Unqualified (UQ)—Aircrew members who are not qualified to fly or operate E-3 systems and
equipment unless they are under the supervision of a qualified instructor in the applicable crew
position.
Weapons Systems Academic Training (WSAT)—Quarterly academic training designed to
provide crewmembers with information on tactics, employment, training and evaluation trends,
procedures, and changes to E-3 software and equipment.
