Section C—Scheduling the Study/Review and Processing Reports

8. Types of Studies and Reviews. DOD 3150.2-M, DoD Nuclear Weapon System Safety
Program Manual, describes the types of studies and reviews the Air Force must conduct at a
minimum. The NWSSG Chairman will determine the need and scope of studies.
   8.1. Initial Safety Study (ISS) examines design features and aspects of the proposed concept
   of operations (if available) that will affect the safety of the nuclear weapon system.
   8.2. Preliminary Safety Study (PSS) examines design features, hardware, procedures, and
   aspects of the concept of operations that affect the safety of the nuclear weapon system.
   8.3. Interim Safety Study (INSS) reviews any changes to the nuclear weapon system since
   the Preliminary Safety Study.
   8.4. Pre-Operational Safety Study (POSS) examines safety procedures for new or modified
   systems, and aspects of the concept of operations that will affect the safety of the nuclear
   weapon system to determine if the DoD nuclear weapon system safety standards are met.
   This is the first opportunity to draft weapon system safety rules for a new system.
   8.5. Operational Safety Review (OSR) examines all operational aspects of a nuclear weapon
   or nuclear weapon system for safety to determine if the DoD four safety standards addressed
   in para 2 are met. The weapon system’s first OSR takes place during the second year after
   the initial approval of safety rules. Recurring OSRs shall be conducted at intervals not to
   exceed 5 years from the start of the weapon system’s preceding OSR.
   8.6. Special Safety Studies (SSS) investigate unsafe conditions revealed by operational
   experience; accidents and/or incidents; modifications (including software), tests, or retrofits

          nuclear weapons.
      9.3.4. Phase III of the study or review will make a determination if the nuclear weapon
      system is being operated in a manner that meets the DoD nuclear weapon system safety
      policy and standards. Phase III includes:
          9.3.4.1. Discussion and deliberation on findings and items of interest raised during
          Phase I or Phase II.
          9.3.4.2. Preparing safety rules for new weapon systems or recommending changes to
          existing safety rules that ensure the weapon system meets the DoD nuclear weapon
          system safety standards or provides improvements to operations.
          9.3.4.3. Preparing and signing NWSSG Report for submission to HAF.
      9.3.5. NWSSG Executive Support Staff coordinates with the applicable MAJCOM/SEW
      to make every effort to vary the Phase II locations of studies for multi-unit weapon
      systems, based upon operational availability.
      9.3.6. MAJCOMs will coordinate required briefings and demonstrations with
      subordinate units supporting Phase II and NWSSG Support Staff.
      9.3.7. The NWSSG is disbanded when the HAF accepts the NWSSG Report.
10. Safety Rules Processing Responsibilities. DOD 3150.2-M requires prompt report
processing (See Attachment 3 for post-study timeline).
   10.1. At the conclusion of the study, NWSSG Support Staff will create a NWSSG Report.
   The NWSSG Report will not be changed following the signature of the NWSSG members,
   other than to correct administrative errors. Within 2 weeks of completing the study,
   AFSC/SEW will notify ODATSD (NM) of completion of the study/review and forward
   electronic copies of the NWSSG Report via classified email to AF/SEI for appropriate HAF
   3-letter offices for the weapon system under review for coordination and comments. AF/ SEI
   will:
      10.1.1. Request appropriate HAF 3-letter offices coordinate on the NWSSG Report and
      approve/disapprove, with applicable rationale, the findings and recommendations.
      10.1.2. Request that approved recommendations include corrective actions, as required,
      from the appropriate office/agency.
   10.2. Within 4 weeks of receipt of the NWSSG Report, HAF 3-letter agencies will review,
   approve or disapprove, with applicable rationale, the findings and recommendations.
   Agencies will also provide any comments to aid with publishing the NWSSR and return
   report to AF/SEI. AF/SEI will consolidate HAF comments and provide them to AFSC/SEW
   for incorporation (as appropriate) in the Air Force NWSSR.

     under review for coordination and comments.
     10.2.2. AF/SEI will request appropriate HAF 2-letter offices coordinate on the NWSSR
     within 3 weeks.
     10.2.3. AF/SEI will consolidate HAF 2-letter comments and provide them to
     AFSC/SEW for publishing of the Air Force NWSSR. AFSC/SEW will publish the
     NWSSR within 4 weeks of receipt of the HAF 2-letter approval of the NWSSR.
     AFSC/SEW will distribute the NWSSR to appropriate agencies, including ODATSD
     (NM), Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, voting member organizations, OPRs for
     approved recommendations, appropriate commands/agencies, and NWSSG advisors.
  10.3. If the NWSSG Report includes proposed rules for new systems or proposed changes to
  current rules, AFSC/SEW will prepare a separate Air Force Safety Rules Package and
  forward it to AF/SEI for separate coordination and approval with the NWSSR.
     10.3.1. AF/SEI will ensure appropriate offices review proposed safety rules and
     recommend approval/disapproval. If approval by all offices cannot be obtained, AF/SE
     will forward issues to Vice Chief of Staff, Air Force, for final resolution.
     10.3.2. AF/SEI will send the Air Force Safety Rules Package to ODATSD (NM), who,
     in turn, will send to the following organizations for coordination: OSD staff, Joint Staff,
     DTRA, and DOE/National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).
         10.3.3.1. The Joint Staff will coordinate the safety rules package with
         USSTRATCOM and United States European Command (for strike fighter safety rules
         only). Re-coordinating with the Service submitting the proposed safety rules package
         is not required.
         10.3.3.2. Critical comments or non-concurrences received from the DOE/NNSA
         shall be provided from AF/SEI to the Joint Staff, the appropriate Service, and
         considered prior to requesting the Deputy Secretary of Defense approval of the rules.
         10.3.3.3. Critical comments or non-concurrences received from the Joint Staff or
         DTRA shall be provided from AF/SEI to the originating Service and resolved prior to
         requesting Deputy Secretary of Defense approval of the rules.
     10.3.4. Once coordination is completed, ODATSD (NM) will submit a recommendation
     for approval or disapproval, through the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,
     Technology, and Logistics (USD (AT&L)), to the SECDEF, who approves/disapproves.
     10.3.5. ODATSD (NM) will return approved nuclear weapon system safety rules to the
     originating Service, with copies to the Joint Staff and DTRA, for implementation.
     10.3.6. Upon notification of rules approval, AF/SEI will forward a copy of approved
     rules to AFSC/SEW. These rules are included in the appropriate weapon system 91-
     series AFI for the system under review. Unless otherwise specified, safety rules and
     revisions to approved safety rules in the AFI shall be implemented by appropriate
     agencies within 30 days of SECDEF approval.

   10.4. AFSC/SEW, upon receipt of SECDEF-approved rules, will forward copies to the
   appropriate agencies (responsible MAJCOM safety offices and system program offices)
   under AF/SE signature directing immediate implementation of approved rules. AFSC/SEW
   will publish the approved safety rules in the appropriate 91-series AFI as soon as possible.
   10.5. If circumstances necessitate approval of proposed safety rules before completion of the
   formal coordination process, the following applies:
       10.5.1. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff may request that the SECDEF grant
       interim approval of the proposed safety rules.
       10.5.2. ODATSD (NM) will provide the interim safety rules package to DOE with a 7-
       day suspense.
       10.5.3. Interim approval of the safety rules is effective for 6 months and does not negate
       the requirement for final processing of the Safety Rules Package.
       10.5.4. If final processing of the safety rules is not completed within the 6-month period,
       AFSC/SEW must request an extension from ODATSD (NM).

Section D—Supporting Documents and Briefings

11. Air Force Data Package. The Air Force Data package consists of the materials provided to
NWSSG voting members prior to the NWSSG study/review for their preparation and use during
the study or review. Package includes:
   11.1. Operational Plan Data Document (if applicable – MAJCOM).
   11.2. Weapon system concept of operations (MAJCOM).
   11.3. TNSA for studies and certain reviews (AFNWC).
   11.4. Technical description of the weapon system and its system safety features, when not
   included in TNSA (AFMC/MAJCOM).
   11.5. Draft or current safety rules located in the appropriate weapon system 91-series AFI
   (AFSC/SEW).
12. NWSSG Report. An NWSSG report is a summary of NWSSG proceedings. It is not a
technical or engineering source document (DoD RCS: AT&L (A) 1994). DOD 3150.2-M,
Appendix 3, contains the basic report format as follows:
   12.1. Executive Summary will summarize the study results and include an appraisal
   statement as to whether the system meets DoD nuclear weapon system safety policy and
   standards.
   12.2. Study Overview will summarize the study’s scope, background, purpose, and
   comments on the impact of safety on the system’s concept of operations.
   12.3. Findings, Recommendations and Corrective Actions Section will state facts or
   conclusions regarding the nuclear safety of the weapon system and recommendations to
   enhance safety consistent with operational requirements.
       12.3.1. A finding or recommendation must be approved by a majority of the NWSSG
       voting members.
AFI91-102_USAFESUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012                                                            13


      12.3.2. Priority assignments for NWSSG recommendations:
          12.3.2.1. Immediate Action. (USE OF THE NUCLEAR WEAPON SYSTEM IS
          IMMEDIATELY RESTRICTED UNTIL RECOMMENDED ACTIONS ARE
          COMPLETED.) Reserved for recommendations made to correct deficiencies that
          prevent the weapon system from meeting one or more of the DoD Nuclear Weapon
          System Safety Standards. It either restricts certain operations of the nuclear weapon
          system or completely prohibits use of the system until approved recommendations are
          complied with.
          12.3.2.2. Urgent Action. (USE OF THE NUCLEAR WEAPON SYSTEM MAY BE
          RESTRICTED IF APPROVED RECOMMENDATIONS ARE NOT COMPLIED
          WITH BY THE SUSPENSE DATE.) Reserved for those recommendations which
          conclude that, while the system currently meets required safety standards, prompt
          corrective actions are required to ensure no violation of any of the DoD Nuclear
          Weapon System Safety Standards occurs in the future. Peacetime restriction of the
          weapon system may be warranted, if approved recommendations are not complied
          with by the suspense date or if an approved extension to the suspense date is not
          granted.
          12.3.2.3. Time Compliance. (USE OF THE WEAPON SYSTEM IS NOT
          RESTRICTED.) Reserved for recommendations that simply enhance nuclear surety.
          These recommendations are intended to make the system better and do not imply any
          failure to meet existing safety standards. The weapon system may be operated while
          action is being taken to comply with an approved recommendation. Failure to
          comply by the stated suspense date will not restrict use of the weapon system.
   12.4. Draft Safety Rules for new systems or proposed changes to existing rules, which are
   NWSSG recommendations to HAF for safe operations of the weapon system, based upon
   NWSSG findings during the study/review.
      12.4.1. A safety rule must be approved by a majority of the NWSSG voting members.
   12.5. An Addendum of Minority Opinions may be included. It shall be appended to the
   NWSSG Report if agreement is not reached by the NWSSG through discussion and
   deliberation and those in the minority deem such an addendum is appropriate. The format
   will be the same as the findings and recommendations of the basic report and signed by each
   member supporting the minority position.
      12.5.1. The Minority Report shall be submitted for inclusion into the basic report prior to
      adjourning the Phase III meeting and shall be made available for all members to review.
13. Air Force NWSSR. The Air Force NWSSR presents the Air Force assessment of whether
the weapon system meets the four DoD safety standards addressed in para 2. The NWSSG
Report is the basis for the NWSSR.
   13.1. The Executive Summary will summarize the Air Force position on the study results
   and include an appraisal statement that assesses whether or not the weapon system meets
   DoD nuclear weapon system safety policy and standards. If there are differences in any
   portion of the Air Force NWSSR and the NWSSG Report, the Executive Summary will note
   the differences and rationale for disagreement.

   14.3. Part B: Safety Features incorporated in the weapon system.
   14.4. Part C: Proposed Safety Rules.
15. Operational Plan Data Document (OPDD). The OPDD is the operating command’s
statement of how the command operates and maintains (or, if applicable, for a new or
significantly modified weapon system, how the command plans to operate and maintain) the
nuclear weapon system being studied by the NWSSG. In addition, the OPDD serves as a source
document for the TNSA or abbreviated TNSA when required.
   15.1. The OPDD describes:
       15.1.1. The nuclear weapon system’s current or proposed (for new or significantly
       modified weapons systems) concept of operations.
       15.1.2. General operations commonly performed regardless of geographical location.

       and periods of increased hostilities.
       15.1.5. Operations conducted under contingency plans.
   15.2. An OPDD will be provided to the NWSSG by the operational MAJCOM. If the
   OPDD is new or requires changes to support an NWSSG study or review, the MAJCOM will
   prepare the OPDD in sufficient time to ensure approval and distribution. If a TNSA is
   required, the MAJCOM must provide the final approved OPDD (or change) to AFSC/SEW 6
   months before the study is scheduled to begin.
AFI91-102_USAFESUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012                                                             15


      15.2.1. The MAJCOM will summarize operations, refer to applicable source documents
      for greater detail, and include all desired operational and system capabilities in the
      OPDD. The weapon system safety rules proposed by the NWSSG may not allow all
      desired capabilities, but they will not even be considered, if not included in the OPDD.
      Commands can NOT add operational capabilities after the SECDEF approves the safety
      rules without an NWSSG study/review.
16. Technical Nuclear Safety Analysis (TNSA). The TNSA is prepared by the Air Force
Nuclear Weapons Center IAW AFI 63-125, Nuclear Certification Program, 15 Mar 04,
