                           MWD CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS

1.1. MWD Concept: The MWD program is a critical enabler to the capability of Security
Forces (SF) to defeat threats inside and outside the base boundary. The AF MWD Team
(MWDT) also serves a vital role in offensive and defensive operations with the other Department
of Defense (DoD) components. The objective of this instruction is to employ MWD assets more
aggressively and effectively to counter threats. This provides the framework for employment and
utilization to support Integrated Defense (ID) as outlined in AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense.
Ensuring our forces can Anticipate, Deter, Detect, Assess, Warn, Defeat, Delay, Defend, and
Recover.
1.2. Overview. This instruction prescribes responsibilities, policies, and procedures for the
direction, management, and control of the AF MWD Program. It explains how MWDTs are used
in non–combat and combat support missions including area security, law enforcement, and
antiterrorism, to include narcotics and explosive detection.

        complete history of patrol training, utilization and performance. Handlers annotate each
        duty day and sign at the end of each month. The Kennel Master will sign as the reviewing
        official at the end of each month.
        2.8.6.3. AF Form 323, Military Working Dog Training and Utilization Record for
        Drug/Explosive Detector Dogs. Records training, utilization and performance of detector
        dogs. It serves as the basis for establishing probable cause. Annotate and sign the same as
        the AF Form 321.
        2.8.6.4. AF Form 324, Military Working Dog Program Status Report. Report is used to
        record the number and type of MWDs authorized and assigned to each unit. It also
        annotates the total kennel capacity, the number handlers authorized and assigned, the
        pairing of dog teams and the kennel support staff (i.e., the Kennel Master and Trainer(s)).
            2.8.6.4.1. The AF Form 324 is prepared by the unit and forwarded to the MAJCOM
            MWD PM, which in turn forwards it to the USAF MWD PM NLT the 5th of the
AFI31-121 17 OCTOBER 2012                                                                    9


          month following each quarter. The AF Form 324 is essential to effectively managing
          the USAF and DOD MWD program(s).
   2.8.7. Establish a minimum monthly Optimum Training Requirement (OTR) for all MWDs
   assigned to the unit kennels.
       2.8.7.1. The OTR may differ between MWDTs as every team has differing capabilities.
       The OTR will be established so that it will enhance and evolve the capabilities of the
       MWDT.
   2.8.8. Identify the tracking capability of each MWD and annotate the assessment in the
   MWD’s records. Refer to AFMAN 31-219 for the tracking training protocol and standards.
       2.8.8.1. When an MWD is identified with the capability to track, reasonable effort will
       be made to train and maintain the MWD’s ability to track.
       2.8.8.2. All training standards will be outlined in the OTR.
   2.8.9. Identify the off leash capability of each MWD and annotate the assessment in the
   MWD’s records. Refer to AFMAN 31-219 for the enhanced off leash training protocol and
   standards.
       2.8.9.1. MWDs identified with the capability to work independently and dependably will
       be trained and maintained to work off leash.
       2.8.9.2. All training standards will be outlined in the OTR.
   2.8.10. Work with the Unit Deployment Manager (UDM) to ensure MWD assets are
   properly postured and accurately reported.
2.9. MWD Trainer. The MWD Trainer is responsible for training the unit’s MWDs and
handlers using authorized effective training methodology to maximize an MWDT’s capabilities.
The Trainer must be a graduate of the 341 TRS MWD KM Course or complete the course within
90 days of appointment as Trainer. To be eligible to attend this course, personnel must already
have attended the MWD Handler Course and been awarded the AFSC 3P051A. The MWD
Trainer will:
   2.9.1. Develop training plans in accordance with established OTR. Prepare short and long
   term training outlines and risk assessments based upon garrison force protection needs and
   deployment requirements.
   2.9.2. Assist in the supervision of the installation MWD program.
   2.9.3. Act as the KM when KM is absent.
   2.9.4. Validate and supervise sustainment training.
   2.9.5. Supervise the deployment preparation of MWDTs.
   2.9.6. Develop a predeployment training program based upon current threats and enemy
   Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP).
2.10. MWD Handler. MWD handlers provide the daily care and grooming for their assigned
MWD. They ensure sustainment skills are maintained for their assigned MWD. Personnel,
regardless of rank and status, must complete the MWD Handler Course prior to handling an
MWD. The handler must enter and complete upgrade training to the 5-skill level before being

 MWD AUTHORIZATIONS, REQUISITIONS, ASSIGNMENTS, AND DISPOSITIONS

3.1. Authorizations. As a baseline, six detector dogs are authorized per installation. Exceptions
shall be based upon operational requirements, existing manpower/MWD authorizations, base
population and geography, or other unit-specific requirements. Exceptions and changes will be
staffed as variances and approved by the MAJCOM/A7S and must be coordinated through HQ
AFSFC. Standards will specify the manpower authorizations for KMs, trainers, and handlers.
The wing manpower office will validate MWD manpower authorizations. Drug detector dogs
(DDD) will not exceed one-third of the unit’s total MWD authorizations. Authorizations will be
posted and tracked in WDMS.
   3.1.1. MWD Authorization Process. It is the responsibility of the USAF MWD PM to
   validate all authorization increases using the criterion identified in AFI 23-126(I), DoD Dog
   Program. For guidance on authorizations, requisitions, and dispositions of MWDs, see
   AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapters 9 and 22, USAF Supply Manual.
       3.1.1.1. Requests for initial, increases, or decreases in existing MWD authorization(s)
       will be forwarded by the requesting DFC in writing to the USAF MWD PM through the
       MAJCOM/A7S. Prior to submitting the authorization change request, the DFC will:
           3.1.1.1.1. Ensure MWD qualified personnel are assigned to validated MWD
           positions on the Unit Manpower Personnel Roster (UMPR). MWD qualified
           personnel may be assigned to non-MWD positions only after all MWD positions are
           filled with qualified personnel. Management decisions to employ MWD qualified
           personnel in other positions will not normally generate a PCS backfill requirement.
           Additionally, management decisions to employ MWD qualified personnel in other
           positions do not relieve the unit of filling MWD Unit Tasking Code (UTC)
           requirements.
           3.1.1.1.2. Ensure all coordination with servicing veterinarian has been accomplished
           and an ability to support memorandum is provided.
           3.1.1.1.3. Ensure there is adequate kennel space to support all MWD authorizations.
       3.1.1.2. The USAF MWD PM will notify the DoD MWD PM of changes made once
       approved by the HQ AFSFC stating nomenclature, MAJCOM, and unit of what
       authorization changes will be applied.
   3.1.2. Kennel staff manpower requirements are identified in the SF Capabilities-based
   Manpower Standard and should be reflected in FAC 43S360 on the Unit Manpower
   Document (UMD).
   3.1.3. The only types of MWDs authorized for requisition by USAF units are:
       3.1.3.1. Patrol Dog (PD), National Stock number (NSN) 8820-00-435-9005.
       3.1.3.2. Patrol/Drug Detector Dog (PDDD), NSN 8820-00-243-7542.
       3.1.3.3. Patrol/Explosive Detector Dog (PEDD), NSN 8820-00-188-3880.
       3.1.3.4. Drug Detector Dog (DDD)/Large, NSN 8820-00-238-8577.
 12                                                            AFI31-121 17 OCTOBER 2012


          3.1.3.4.1. In order to maintain a total force multiplier in regards to ID, DDDs are
          only authorized upon written approval by the USAF MWD PM. Units requiring a
          DDD must submit written justification the need for a DDD through their
          MAJCOM/A7S. All DDDs currently in the inventory are authorized and will be
          replaced only upon normal lifecycle attrition.
       3.1.3.5. Explosive Detector Dog (EDD), NSN 8820-00-043-3526.
          3.1.3.5.1. All EDDs assigned to a PEDD authorization will be evaluated for the
          capability to be trained for possible certification as PEDD. If it is determined the
          EDD is not suitable for patrol training, annotate the evaluation and reasons for non-
          suitability in the MWD’s records. If an EDD is deemed capable of patrol certification,
          the EDD will be entered into training for no less than 30-days. The EDD will conduct
          this training as feasible so as not to interfere with the MWDT’s mission requirements.
          Refer to AFMAN 31-219 for the evaluation standards and training protocol.
3.2. Requisitions. MWD requisitions are submitted independent of student training quotas.
These requisitions are maintained on a backlog listing by the USAF MWD PM and forwarded to
the 341 TRS monthly. Requisitions are filled on an authorization-based, equitable distribution
basis, with placement priority determined by the greatest needs of the AF. Requisitions will be
posted and tracked in WDMS.
   3.2.1. A new MWD may be requisitioned based upon the following conditions:
       3.2.1.1. Authorized vacancy.
       3.2.1.2. New authorization or approved addition as outlined in authorizations.
       3.2.1.3. Health of a current MWD assigned to the unit has a sudden and significant
       degradation of performance in the MWD.
       3.2.1.4. Sudden death or euthanasia of an MWD.
       3.2.1.5. An MWD recently issued by 341 TRS fails to meet certification standards.
       3.2.1.6. Excess MWDs, which are defined as:
          3.2.1.6.1. An MWD no longer filling an authorized position and there are no other
          units, MAJCOMs, or service components which are in need of the MWD.
          3.2.1.6.2. A dual purpose MWD which is no longer capable of maintaining
          certification in both functions.
          3.2.1.6.3. An MWD has been identified and approved for adoption.
   3.2.2. Requisition requirements must be identified as early as possible. It is not necessary to
   wait until an MWD dies or becomes incapacitated to requisition a replacement.
   3.2.3. Requests for initial requisitions will be approved based upon authorizations which
   have been validated by the circumstances listed in paragraph 3.2.1.
   3.2.4. All requisitions for MWDs must be sent in Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue
   Procedures (MILSTRIP) format. MAJCOMs must submit requisitions through the USAF
   MWD PM for validation and tracked in the WDMS.
AFI31-121 17 OCTOBER 2012                                                                 13


   3.2.5. Units requesting MWDs will submit an AF Form 601, Equipment Action Request, to
   their supporting Equipment Liaison Office (ELO) at the Logistics Readiness Squadron
   (LRS). Include a requisition number on the bottom portion of the form (cc 36-49).
3.3. MWD Assignments. The objective of the assignment process is to provide the AF with an
equal distribution of MWDs and USAF MWD PM will assign MWDs to the MAJCOMs based
upon the needs of the AF. Assignments will be posted and tracked in WDMS.
3.4. MWD Dispositions. Dispositions must be submitted by package from the DFC
accountable for the MWD. All packages must be completed in accordance with the MWD
Disposition and Adoption Procedures Guide. The package must be submitted through the
MAJCOM MWD PM to the USAF MWD PM. The USAF MWD PM will review all packages
for completeness prior to submission to the 341 TRS. The USAF MWD PM will provide
concurrence or non-concurrence via the Disposition Request Memorandum. Dispositions will be
posted and tracked in WDMS.
   3.4.1. There are only three (3) types of dispositions authorized for MWDs.
       3.4.1.1. The DFC must consider recommendations from the KM, veterinarian, and bite
       muzzle video provided by the 341 TRS/SGV before making the final disposition
       decision.
       3.4.1.2. Adopt the MWD to a suitable home.
       3.4.1.3. Transfer to law enforcement if medically eligible.
       3.4.1.4. Euthanasia which can only be performed after veterinary consultation with 341
       TRS/SGV. However, there are exigent circumstances in which the veterinarian may need
       to conduct an emergency euthanasia.
   3.4.2. KMs will not conduct any bite muzzle tests that are not in accordance with the MWD
   Disposition and Adoption Procedures Guide.
       3.4.2.1. KMs may return excess MWDs to the 341 TRS only when authorized and
       approved in writing by USAF MWD PM.

                                          Chapter 4

                          MWD PROGRAM AND UTILIZATION

4.1. Objective. Provide SF an enhanced capability to secure protection level resources, enforce
military laws and regulations, suppress the use of illegal drugs, detect explosives, and protect
installations and resources during peacetime, war, and in support of operations other than war.
Select posts with first consideration given to the MWD’s keen sense of smell. MWDs are most
effective during nighttime hours and in areas of minimal activity. Rotate MWDTs through all
appropriate posts to meet operational needs and to maintain proficiency of the MWDT.
   4.1.1. Unless an MWDT is conducting explosives or narcotics detection, observation or
   listening post duties, or psychological deterrence duties, MWDTs will not be placed on static
   posts.
   4.1.2. MWDs may be used to, but not limited to, conduct the following duties:
       4.1.2.1. Law Enforcement. Controlled aggression certified MWDs seek, detect, bite and
       hold, and guard suspects on command during patrol. They provide a psychological
       deterrence and can defend their handlers during threatening situations. They can assist in
       crowd control and confrontation management, and search for suspects and lost personnel,
       indoors and outdoors.
       4.1.2.2. No MWD will be used to validate the response of another MWD or mechanical
       device used to detect explosives or narcotics.
       4.1.2.3. Drug Suppression. DDD teams are specially trained in drug detection and
       support the Air Force goal of a drug-free environment. Their renowned capability to
       detect illegal drugs deters drug use and possession, and is a valuable adjunct to a
       commander's other tools such as urinalysis and investigation.
       4.1.2.4. Explosive Detection. EDD teams are exceptionally valuable in antiterrorism
       operations. They are capable of detecting unexploded ordnance, searching large areas
       during bomb threats quickly, and are valuable in augmenting Explosive Ordnance
       Disposal (EOD) capabilities.
           4.1.2.4.1. EDDs will not be used to search suspicious/unattended packages or assess,
           examine, and clear items already identified as a possible improvised explosive device
           (IED). However, there may be times in a theater of combat when EOD is not
           available and an item needs to be cleared. In these cases, only the MWD handler will
           determine if the search will be conducted. If an MWD handler decides to search such
           an item, the handler should consider avenue of approach, local threats and enemy
           TTPs, and use the MWD off leash to maintain standoff.
       4.1.2.5. Combat Operations. In war fighting roles, MWDTs provide enhanced patrol and
       detection capability to perimeter and point defense. In bare base operations, deploy
       MWDs as an early warning system. Given the range of potential contingencies, drug and
       explosives detection are also valuable added capabilities in these environments since they
       are PDs first and detector dogs second.
AFI31-121 17 OCTOBER 2012                                                                     15


          4.1.2.5.1. Under no circumstances will any type of MWD be used in the interrogation
          or interview of Enemy Prisoners of War (EPW) or detainees. Refer to AFMAN 31-
          219 for more guidance on contingency operations.
      4.1.2.6. Physical Security. The MWDT can augment detection roles and temporarily
      replace inoperative sensor systems.
   4.1.3. MWD Competitions and Demonstrations. MWDTs are encouraged to take part in
   public demonstrations and competitions conducted by civilian or military police agencies.
      4.1.3.1. Demonstrations by EDDs are highly discouraged as it may generate prank bomb
      threats, identify which MWDs are EDDs, and inform criminals and terrorists what odors
      MWDs are capable of finding.
4.2. MWD Utilization and Employment
   4.2.1. The DFC will establish local procedures for MWD utilization. These procedures must
   conform to all DoD and AF instructions, state and local laws, when applicable, and local
   Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA) or other host nation agreements.
   4.2.2. MWD handlers should only be assigned one MWD as their responsibility to certify
   and work. However, handlers may be assigned and certified on a second MWD during times
   of handler shortages. Handlers will not be assigned more than two MWDs. The additional
   certification should only be used sparingly with the intent of offsetting deployment and
   operational home station mission requirements. It is the responsibility of the kennel staff to
   maintain and care for any MWDs not assigned to a handler or while the MWD’s handler is
   on temporary duty (TDY) or leave.
      4.2.2.1. The KM or Trainers will ensure the MWD is exercised and groomed, and will
      ensure proficiency training is conducted.
      4.2.2.2. KMs and Trainers may be certified with MWDs during times of extended
      handler shortages.
   4.2.3. During an emergency bomb threat situation, the KM or Trainers may use another
   handler’s MWD for explosive detection only. The KM will make the decision based upon
   knowledge of the MWD and of the situation.
   4.2.4. Searches. The search granting authority may accept the certification of an MWDT
   from another installation after review of the MWDT’s probable cause folder.
      4.2.4.1. The base staff judge advocate (SJA) will provide guidance on conducting
      searches. Coordinate searches of postal facilities with the base SJA.
      4.2.4.2. Detector dogs will never be used to search a person.
   4.2.5. The official authorizing a search must be confident of the detector dog's ability to
   successfully detect.
   4.2.6. A Probable Cause (PC) folder will be maintained on all detector dogs. This folder is a
   compilation of information to provide assurance and continuity for detector teams. Each
   MWDT will have a PC folder and each folder will contain:
      4.2.6.1. A general record of the training and experience of the MWDT (AF Form 321).
16                                                            AFI31-121 17 OCTOBER 2012


     4.2.6.2. A detailed record showing the number of checks or searches, by date, locations,
     responses, and finds (AF Form 323).
     4.2.6.3. A record showing when the search granting authority reviewed the PC records.
     The search-granting authority or designee will review each folder quarterly or after initial
     certification and document the results by signature and date.
     4.2.6.4. A memorandum verifying the search-granting authority or delegated authority
     witnessed a detection certification demonstration in accordance with Chapter 6 of this
     instruction. The memorandum must contain the date of certification, the substances used,
     the results of the MWDT's effort, and if the certifier witnessed the MWD utilized on or
     off leash.
  4.2.7. The KM will prepare a quarterly summary statement confirming the reliability of each
  detector team. The statement will include the total time of detection in actual and training
  searches in each area shown on the AF Form 323. The summary must agree with other facts
  in the file and include the validation test percentage of accuracy. This record will accompany
  MWDTs when TDY.
  4.2.8. MWDTs are authorized to provide detection support to civilian law enforcement
  agencies (CLEA) as long as the support incurs no costs to the government and does not
  impact unit readiness. For further information on support to CLEAs and other non-DoD
  agencies, refer to Chapter 11.
  4.2.9. EDD teams primarily respond to explosive threats or serve as a deterrent through
  random searches. Use the following guidance when responding to bomb threats or situations
  where the presence of explosive devices is suspected:
     4.2.9.1. Evacuate the area depending upon the threat received, local policy, and/or when
     ordered by base officials.
     4.2.9.2. Do not move or disturb anything. IEDs can be triggered many ways, including
     lifting, tilting, pushing, pulling, or by remote detonation.
     4.2.9.3. If lights or other electrical or mechanical appliances are on, leave them on. If
     lights are off, leave them off until the search is completed.
     4.2.9.4. Note areas where the MWD shows significant interest, but failed to give a
     response so EOD can conduct follow-up searches.
     4.2.9.5. Do not touch or retrieve suspected objects or allow the MWD to scratch, paw, or
     bite at the object.
     4.2.9.6. If the MWD responds during a search, mark the area and immediately notify
     EOD personnel. Do not re-enter the area with the MWD for the purpose of pinpointing or
     to further investigate the object.
         4.2.9.6.1. It is strictly prohibited to use a second MWD to confirm or deny the
         legitimacy of the response. This practice adds unnecessary confusion and danger to
         the situation, especially if one MWD alerts and the other does not.
         4.2.9.6.2. EOD will determine if the package, object, or area is safe.
  4.2.10. Refer to AFMAN 31-219 for further information on MWD employment.
AFI31-121 17 OCTOBER 2012                                                                   17


4.3. Safety Procedures. The safety procedures in this AFI will be adhered to at all times to
protect MWDs and all personnel who come in contact with MWDs. The following safety rules
apply.
   4.3.1. KMs will:
       4.3.1.1. Establish and enforce physical control measures to prevent MWDs from getting
       loose in the MWD Kennel Facility.
       4.3.1.2. Establish a ―one-way system‖ in the kennel. This system must be identified by
       ground/wall signs and explained in the kennel operating instructions.
       4.3.1.3. Provide bilingual safety instructions for local national personnel performing
       kennel duties where applicable.
       4.3.1.4. Never allow privately owned or stray animals into the kennel area.
       4.3.1.5. Establish emergency evacuation procedures for MWDs from the kennels.
          4.3.1.5.1. An emergency alternate kennel plan will be identified in the emergency
          evacuation procedures. Emergency kennels can be as simple as maintaining MWDs in
          an MWD transportation trailer until the situation is resolved.
       4.3.1.6. Establish emergency medical procedures in coordination with servicing
       veterinarian.    Include 24-hour emergency contact information and exigent care
       procedures.
   4.3.2. MWD Trainers shall:
       4.3.2.1. Enforce established procedures.
       4.3.2.2. Verify no obvious hazards pose a threat to MWDTs within a designated training
       area.
   4.3.3. All personnel handling MWDs will:
       4.3.3.1. Keep a safe distance between MWDTs at all times. A safe distance is the length
       of the leash being used plus 3-feet.
          4.3.3.1.1. There may be times when exigent situations require MWDs to operate in
          close proximity to others. It should be identified in the records how the MWD reacts
          to personnel and other dogs within close proximity.
          4.3.3.1.2. Maintain a short safety leash when within 6-feet of other personnel and/or
          dogs.
       4.3.3.2. Warn others by loudly announcing their presence when an MWDT could
       unexpectedly encounter a bystander, such as walking or running around blind corners,
       using stairs, or passing an open door. The handler will use phrases such as, ―DOG
       COMING AROUND‖ – ―DOG COMING BY‖ – ―DOG COMING UP/DOWN‖.
       4.3.3.3. Never allow anyone, regardless of position, rank or experience, to pet the MWD
       under their control.
          4.3.3.3.1. Exception: When an MWD is in the adoption process or is a puppy in the
          foster program, the MWD may be exposed to others to ensure the MWD can be safely
          handled by potential adopters and foster families.
 18                                                            AFI31-121 17 OCTOBER 2012


      4.3.3.4. Only use a leather collar and kennel chain to stake an MWD. The choke chain
      will also be used in conjunction with the leather collar in case the collar breaks.
      4.3.3.5. Never secure the MWD to any movable object, especially a vehicle.
      4.3.3.6. Never use a leash to secure an MWD to any object.
      4.3.3.7. Never stake the MWD where it could injure itself or others.
      4.3.3.8. Ensure MWDs are protected from harsh environmental conditions when able to
      do so. Stake MWD in areas where the MWD will be protected from the elements and
      ensure adequate water is available.
      4.3.3.9. Check the MWD frequently if it is left unattended in a temporary kennel or
      shipping crate.
          4.3.3.9.1. Ensure the leather collar remains on the MWD when kenneled in a
          temporary kennel or shipping crate.
      4.3.3.10. Remove leather collar and choke chain while MWDs are in a permanent kennel
      run.
          4.3.3.10.1. Exception: The 341 TRS is permitted to keep leather collars on recently
          procured MWDs awaiting training as necessary. This exception applies only to
          recently procured MWDs in training and is based upon safety, identification, and
          training concerns.
      4.3.3.11. Only relinquish control of the MWD to other trained handlers or veterinary
      personnel.
          4.3.3.11.1. In case of an emergency and no trained handlers or veterinary personnel
          are available, muzzle the MWD and relinquish control to personnel knowledgeable of
          how to transport and kennel the MWD.
          4.3.3.11.2. Exception: When an MWD is in the adoption process or is a puppy in the
          foster program, the MWD may be handled by others to ensure the MWD can be
          safely transferred to potential adopters and foster families.
   4.3.4. Veterinary Clinic Safety Procedures:
      4.3.4.1. The MWD will be muzzled prior to entering any veterinary clinic.
      4.3.4.2. Obtain permission from the veterinary staff prior to entering the clinic.
      4.3.4.3. MWDs will not be allowed to jump onto or off of the examination tables.
      Handlers will wrap the leash around the MWD’s neck, place one arm under the MWD’s
      chest and the other arm under the rear of the MWD, and lift the MWD onto and off of the
      table.
4.4. MWD Use of Force.
   4.4.1. The release of an MWD to bite or allowing it to bite is considered a use of force (UoF)
   but is not considered use of deadly force. Whenever an MWD is used as a means of force,
   ensure the MWD’s actions are only the amount of force necessary to render the subject
   incapable of continuing the actions which led you to use force. For further information
AFI31-121 17 OCTOBER 2012                                                                     19


  regarding use of force, refer to AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force
  Personnel.
  4.4.2. During the following situations, handlers will warn people that their MWD may bite
  with or without command, regardless if the MWD has been trained to attack or not:
     4.4.2.1. Challenging an individual.
     4.4.2.2. Approaching a suspect.
     4.4.2.3. Checking a person's identification.
     4.4.2.4. Participating in any situation that requires the handler to divert full attention
     from the MWD.
  4.4.3. Only MWDs trained and validated in accordance with this instruction by the KM will
  be authorized to be used as a means of use of force.
  4.4.4. When an MWD is to be released to attack a subject, the handler will:
     4.4.4.1. Ensure the MWD has identified the target on which the handler intends to use
     force.
     4.4.4.2. Give the order, ―Halt or I will release my dog,‖ if the situation permits time to
     give the warning.
         4.4.4.2.1. In foreign countries, also give this order in the primary language of the
         host country. Overseas units must provide training for the handlers in the host nation
         language for all MWD warnings.
     4.4.4.3. When able to, warn bystanders to cease all movement before releasing the
     MWD.
  4.4.5. When an MWD is released, the handler will:
     4.4.5.1. Follow the MWD as closely as possible after the MWD is released to bite and
     hold.
     4.4.5.2. Call the MWD off the pursuit if the subject stops or indicates surrender.
  4.4.6. If the MWD bites the subject, the handler will:
     4.4.6.1. Use extreme caution when removing an MWD from a suspect as the MWD will
     be in an agitated state and has a higher potential for an unintended bite on the handler.
     4.4.6.2. Not call the MWD to release the subject until the handler has physically gained
     control of the MWD.
     4.4.6.3. Not jerk or pull the MWD as this may cause unnecessary injury to the subject.
     4.4.6.4. Use proper physical techniques to remove the MWD from the subject if the
     MWD fails to release the subject when ordered to OUT.
     4.4.6.5. Regain and keep leash control of the MWD until it has become calm enough to
     obey the commands to HEEL and STAY.
  4.4.7. Handlers will not release their MWDs if:
20                                                             AFI31-121 17 OCTOBER 2012


     4.4.7.1. The suspect is not in sight, except when they must search an unoccupied
     building.
     4.4.7.2. There are children present, except as a last resort short of deadly force.
     4.4.7.3. The subject is in a crowd of people.
AFI31-121 17 OCTOBER 2012                                                                        21


                                            Chapter 5

                                       MWD TRAINING

5.1. MWD Team General Proficiency Training. The most vital part of all MWD operations is
training. Without frequent and consistent training, the MWD becomes a liability instead of an
asset. This is why it is vital for SF unit leadership to provide ample training required to maintain
proficiency. Therefore, the DFC should provide the opportunities necessary for MWDTs to train
while on duty.
   5.1.1. KMs will develop an OTR for each MWD which will continually improve both the
   MWD and the handler. OTRs should be reviewed monthly on the MWDT’s capabilities to
   ensure the MWDT is constantly striving for greater success.
   5.1.2. The OTR is minimum MWDT proficiency training required of each task per month.
   The OTR will identify if the training task(s) are to be conducted daily, weekly, semi-
   monthly, or monthly. All MWDs will be required to train in all the tasks below unless
   specifically identified. In these cases, only MWDs trained and certified in those tasks will
   conduct training in those areas. Minimum training may change depending upon changes in
   the MWDT’s proficiency level. Each OTR will state, at a minimum, the following:
       5.1.2.1. Basic MWD skills, to include off leash requirements. Basic MWD skills are:
           5.1.2.1.1. Heeling, Marching, Down from the Heel, Heel/Sit from the Down, Stay,
           Down at end of leash, Sit at end of leash, and Recall to the Heel.
       5.1.2.2. Obedience Course both on and off leash.
       5.1.2.3. Gunfire and Pyrotechnics. Gunfire must be fired from both the disinterested
       person and the handler. No less than six rounds of blank ammunition will be fired by the
       disinterested person and six rounds of blank ammunition by the handler for the .38 cal
       and M4/M16 per month.
           5.1.2.3.1. It is highly recommended MWDs be exposed to the firing of live
           ammunition in designated areas, such as the CATM firing range or any other Air
           Force approved firing range on a monthly basis.
       5.1.2.4. Intruder Detection: Intruder detection is not just for MWDs validated in
       controlled aggression, it is also for detector only MWDs. The three types of intruder
       detection are Sight, Sound, and Scent Scouting. All three tasks must be trained and the
       acceptable response will be determined by the KM based upon the MWD’s capabilities.
       If an MWD is unable to accomplish any of these tasks, it must be annotated in the
       MWD’s records.
       5.1.2.5. Controlled Aggression trained MWDs only: Field Interview, Pursuit and Attack,
       Stand Off, Search and Escort, Search and Re-attack, and Building Searches.
       5.1.2.6. Detection only trained MWDs if training aids are available.
           5.1.2.6.1. DDDs: Cocaine, MDMA/Ecstasy, Hashish, Heroin, Marijuana, and
           Methamphetamine.
 22                                                            AFI31-121 17 OCTOBER 2012


          5.1.2.6.2. EDDs: Ammonium Nitrate (AN), Ammonia Dynamite, C-4, Detonation
          Cord, Nitroglycerin Dynamite, Potassium Chlorate, Semtex, Smokeless Powder,
          Sodium Chlorate, TNT, and Water Gel.
          5.1.2.6.3. Enhanced detection dogs trained to work off leash at an extended distance
          will have their training requirements identified on the OTR.
      5.1.2.7. Tracker trained MWDs. Establish minimum track requirements to include length
      of track, track odor sit time, number of different terrains, number of turns (acute angles
      and/or cross tracks), etc.
5.2. Detection Training. The 341 TRS will identify and establish the type of response and
reward for an MWD during procurement. If an MWD’s response or reward needs to be changed
after arrival at a unit, notify the 341 TRS through the USAF MWD PM in writing.
   5.2.1. At no time will a DDD be trained to detect explosives and an EDD trained to detect
   drugs.
      5.2.1.1. Do not train drug and explosive detector dogs in the same areas unless at least 72
      hours have elapsed.
   5.2.2. If a unit has a PD which shows the potential to be certified in detection, the unit may
   locally train the MWD with approval from the MAJCOM MWD PM. However, the MWD
   may only be trained on the odor type it was exposed to during training at the 341 TRS. Refer
   to the MWD’s records for further information about its detection training history.
      5.2.2.1. Explosive detection washouts may never enter into drug detection training and
      vice versa.
      5.2.2.2. Once local training is completed, the MWD must complete initial certification as
      a detector MWD. Initial certification requirements are more stringent than probable cause
      certifications. Request guidance from the 341 TRS for specific training protocol and
      certification requirements. The following are the certifying official’s requirements:
          5.2.2.2.1. Explosives: PDs trained locally on explosives can only be certified by the
          341 TRS. The requesting unit or MAJCOM will pay for the TDY expenses of the
          341 TRS certifying official.
          5.2.2.2.2. Drugs: PDs locally trained on the detection of drugs may only be certified
          by someone who is at least an E-7 or civilian equivalent (contractors are not
          authorized to certify MWDs). The certifier must be a graduate of the 341 TRS MWD
          Trainer/KMs Course and of the MWD Handler Course.
   5.2.3. Units which have certified a locally trained detector dog will forward a memorandum
   from the DFC to the USAF MWD PM through the MAJCOM/A7S requesting a change in
   NSN.
      5.2.3.1. The MAJCOM MWD PM will endorse the letter and send it to the USAF MWD
      PM who will forward a copy to the 341 TRS and return the original to the unit. After
      USAF MWD PM approval, the unit will process a request through the base supply
      channels to change the NSN to appropriate NSN. The unit will then annotate the new
      stock number on the DD Form 1834 and send the changed DD Form 1834 to the 341
      TRS.
AFI31-121 17 OCTOBER 2012                                                                     23


5.3. Training with Additional Substances. Training with odors or substances, to include
synthetic or pseudo scents, other than those listed in this instruction are unauthorized unless
approved in writing by the USAF MWD PM.
   5.3.1. In the event a unit has a need to train on additional substances, a memorandum must
   be coordinated through the MAJCOM MWD PM which includes documentation supporting
   the need for the additional substance. Support documentation can be a memorandum from the
   local AF Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), SF Investigations (S2I), or the Wing
   Antiterrorism Office. If approved, all requirements for the training aid must be adhered to in
   order to procure the new substance.
   5.3.2. EDDs are authorized to be trained on the following odors:
       5.3.2.1. AN, Ammonia Dynamite, C-4, Detonating Cord, Nitroglycerin Dynamite,
       Potassium Chlorate, Semtex, Smokeless Powder, Sodium Chlorate, TNT, and Water Gel
   5.3.3. DDDs are authorized to be trained on the following odors:
       5.3.3.1. Cocaine, MDMA/Ecstasy, Heroin, and Marijuana.
 24                                                             AFI31-121 17 OCTOBER 2012


                                           Chapter 6

         MWD PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AND VALIDATION TESTING

6.1. Standards. MWDTs are measured against minimum performance standards. Specific tasks
are assigned different degrees of importance: Critical, Semi-Critical, and Non-Critical.
   6.1.1. Critical Tasks. Any MWD which fails a critical task on three consecutive training
   days without reason must enter extensive remedial training. If remedial training is
   unsuccessful, initiate decertification actions.
   6.1.2. Semi Critical Tasks. The operational effectiveness of MWDTs failing semi-critical
   tasks will not seriously degrade the MWDT’s capabilities. These MWDTs must, however,
   receive corrective action to eliminate or reduce the deficiency.
   6.1.3. Non-Critical Tasks. Failure to meet non-critical task standards may affect the
   MWDT’s efficiency but will not degrade their overall performance.
   6.1.4. Patrol and Obedience.
      6.1.4.1. Critical Tasks are: SIT, DOWN, HEEL, and GUNFIRE TOLERANCE.
          6.1.4.1.1. In order to pass Gunfire Tolerance, an MWD cannot show any signs of
          aggression or fear of the weapon or person firing the weapon.
              6.1.4.1.1.1. Aggression includes, but is not limited to, attempting to bite the
              weapon, the handler, the disinterested person, or other personnel in the area.
              Barking towards the gunfire is not considered aggression, although it is
              undesirable and all attempts should be made to correct the behavior.
              6.1.4.1.1.2. Fear is when the MWD attempts to flee the area. Barking, slouching,
              tail-tucking, and other similar behavior is not considered unacceptable fear
              behavior.
      6.1.4.2. Semi-Critical Tasks are: SIT END OF LEASH, DOWN END OF LEASH,
      RECALL TO HEEL, and INTRUDER DETECTION.
      6.1.4.3. Non-Critical Tasks are: OBEDIENCE COURSE, CIRCLE DOG, STEP OVER
      DOG, Straddle DOG, and VEHICLE PATROL.
   6.1.5. Controlled Aggression.
      6.1.5.1. Critical Tasks are STAY, FALSE RUN, FIELD INTERVIEW, BITE AND
      HOLD, RELEASE BITE, OUT AND GUARD, STAND-OFF, SEARCH AND
      REATTACK, and BUILDING SEARCH.
      6.1.5.2. Semi-Critical Task is: ESCORT.
   6.1.6. Patrol, Obedience, and Controlled Aggression validations will be conducted at least
   annually or upon initial MWDT certification. If during the validation, any critical task results
   in a failure, the MWDT will be entered immediately into extensive remedial training.
      6.1.6.1. If the MWD fails any controlled aggression critical task, the DFC will issue an
      order in writing for the MWD not to be released in a use of force situation. The
      memorandum will be posted in the MWD’s permanent records until the MWD has
AFI31-121 17 OCTOBER 2012                                                                    25


       completed remedial training and revalidation demonstrating the MWD is capable of
       being employed in a use of force situation.
       6.1.6.2. MWDs which have failed in Patrol, Obedience, and Controlled Aggression may
       continue to be utilized in a detection capacity. If reasonable training efforts are
       unsuccessful, follow guidance in paragraph 6.3.
          6.1.6.2.1. Exception: MWDs which are unable to complete Gunfire Tolerance may
          not continue to be used and must enter into remedial training. If after 120 days of
          remedial training the MWD is unable to successfully complete Gunfire Tolerance,
          follow guidance in paragraph 6.3.
   6.1.7. Detection Standards. Detection tasks are not measured like the Patrol, Obedience, and
   Controlled Aggression using the three criticality standards. Instead, detection dogs are
   evaluated on their capability based upon a percentage standard.
       6.1.7.1. DDDs must maintain a 90% accuracy rate and EDDs must maintain a 95%
       accuracy rate.
       6.1.7.2. Accuracy rates are based upon the totality of all training aids the MWD is
       exposed to during validation or certification.
       6.1.7.3. If the MWD falls below the minimum accuracy requirement in 6.1.7.1. or below
       50% in a single odor during monthly training, the MWDT must immediately enter into
       remedial training.
6.2. Validation and Certification Testing. MWDTs are measured against minimum search
standards. Validation and certification testing will be conducted on all MWDTs on Patrol and
Obedience tasks. The MWD will not be validated or certified on Controlled Aggression or
Detection if it is not qualified in the specific operational area.
   6.2.1. Validation testing is a tool to evaluate MWDT proficiency. Validation testing is not a
   substitute for training and will not be considered as such.
   6.2.2. Validation testing will be conducted at least once every 180-days and prior to initial
   MWDT certification.
   6.2.3. MWDTs must be certified prior to deployment in accordance with United States
   Central Command requirements. MWDTs which are validated are authorized to be utilized in
   support of USSS, other CLEA and home station missions. Only exception is identified in
   paragraph 4.2.3.
   6.2.4. MWDTs must be validated by the KM prior to certification. PD teams are only
   validated and will not be certified by the installation search granting authority.
   6.2.5. Only MWDTs certified by the search granting authority will be used for establishing
   probable cause for issuance of a search warrant or command authority to search.
   6.2.6. The MWD certification demonstration includes each substance the MWD is trained to
   detect. One residual odor test will be included for DDDs only. The residual odor test
   demonstrates that MWDs are not trained to detect the presence of substance but rather the
   odor associated with a particular substance.
 26                                                              AFI31-121 17 OCTOBER 2012


   6.2.7. Certification, as required by this paragraph, is valid only on the installation(s) under
   command authority of the demonstration-witnessing search granting authority. NOTE: The
   witnessing of this demonstration may be delegated to the DFC. Furthermore, the search
   granting authority or DFC delegated may prepare a memorandum for other search granting
   authorities at other locations. If the search granting authority of the other installation(s) is
   confident in the MWD’s ability to detect trained odors, s/he endorses the memorandum
   indicating concurrence and subsequent search authority.
       6.2.7.1. The witnessing of the demonstration may only be delegated one time by the
       installation commander. A person to who was delegated cannot delegate further.
       6.2.7.2. The validation or certification authority must witness a demonstration of the
       MWD while off leash if the MWD has been trained and will conduct operations while off
       leash. The search granting authority memorandum will annotate if off leash capabilities
       were demonstrated.
6.3. Decertification Process. If the MWD fails to maintain detection standards or is unable to
perform any of the critical PD tasks satisfactorily, the KM will direct additional training to
correct deficiencies and document the actions taken in detail.
   6.3.1. The KM is authorized to begin formal decertification to change the MWD’s NSN
   when:
       6.3.1.1. Long-term or unacceptable medical problems prevent the MWD from
       performing critical PD tasks.
          6.3.1.1.1. If the MWD is a dual purpose MWD, use the MWD in the roles it can
          conduct. If the unit does not have a need for the single purpose role, the unit may
          request disposition of the MWD.
       6.3.1.2. Adequate progress is not made within 30-days of remedial training or the KM
       determines the problems are not correctable.
       6.3.1.3. A newly assigned MWD from the 341 TRS cannot perform one or more critical
       tasks within 120-days of assignment.
          6.3.1.3.1. Contact the 341 TRS MWD evaluator, through the MAJCOM and USAF
          MWD PM, prior to starting a decertification package.
   6.3.2. If decertification is necessary, the KM will prepare a decertification package. Refer to
   Chapter 3 of this instruction, AFI 23-126(I), and the Military Working Dog (MWD)
   Disposition and Adoption Procedures guide for final disposition guidance.
       6.3.2.1. The DFC will endorse the disposition package and send it to the respective
       MAJCOM MWD PM and the 341 TRS through the USAF MWD PM. The package will
       include:
          6.3.2.1.1. The apparent cause of the problem.
          6.3.2.1.2. A statement from the veterinarian with the veterinarian’s opinion if the
          MWD's physical condition is the cause of the problem.

7.1. Explosive Training Aid Safety Precautions. Failure to adhere to the safety precautions
within this instruction and the references in this chapter could result in serious bodily harm or
death. Follow all mandatory safety requirements when training EDDs. Training with explosives
is not authorized without detailed Operating Instructions (OI), which include safety procedures.
Explosives safety and handling instructions must be coordinated through the installation safety
office.
   7.1.1. The DFC will ensure all personnel involved in the training of EDDs receive annual
   training on how to safely store, transport, and handle explosive training aids. Kennel OIs will
   identify explosives safety precautions.
       7.1.1.1. OIs will direct a post-training inventory of explosives to ensure no explosives
       are inadvertently left at the training site or discarded.
       7.1.1.2. Safety training will include at a minimum: storage, transportation, and handling
       of explosive training aids.
       7.1.1.3. EOD or munitions safety personnel will conduct the annual explosive safety
       training. However, it is authorized for the KM to develop and conduct explosives safety
       training as long as all training materials are reviewed and approved prior to use by the
       wing safety office. Document training of all personnel involved in EDD training.
       7.1.1.4. Safety training will address the requirements in AFI 31-101, AFMAN 91-201,
       Explosive Safety Standards, and Technical Order (TO) 11A20-16-7, Canine Explosive
       Scent Kit.
   7.1.2. Take the following actions before removing explosive training aids and setting up
   training exercises:
       7.1.2.1. Preclude exposure of personnel not related to the training through prudent
       scheduling and selection of training sites. Coordinate in advance with the training
       location facility owners.
           7.1.2.1.1. When conducting explosives training in facilities or buildings, minimize all
           persons who are not actively involved in the training at least 100-feet from the
           explosives.
       7.1.2.2. Contact the base weather office before each training session. Do not conduct
       training when lightning is within 5 miles of the training area.
       7.1.2.3. Notify the fire department, safety office, and the Base Defense Operations
       Center (BDOC) of the training location and the amount and type of explosives to be used.
       7.1.2.4. Post proper fire symbols and explosive operations signs around the training site
       so they are clearly visible from all avenues of approach.
       7.1.2.5. Post warning signs which state, "Danger--Explosive Dog Training in Progress--
       Keep Out" and explosive safety signs.
AFI31-121 17 OCTOBER 2012                                                                        29


           7.1.2.5.1. Signs will be locally made and measure no less than 3x3 feet, with red
           letters on a white background.
           7.1.2.5.2. In foreign countries, signs will display this warning in the primary
           language of the host nation.

       201.
       7.1.2.7. Do not place explosive training aids near heat or spark producing items, such as
       electrical wiring, radiators, electric heaters, heating vents, engine blocks, or exhaust
       systems. Avoid placing chlorates near water sources.
       7.1.2.8. The KM should work closely with local EOD to routinely conduct mass odor
       training with EDD teams.
       7.1.2.9. Keep all training aids under control at all times.
       7.1.2.10. Personnel must wear protective gloves when handling any explosive training
       aid. Change gloves for each training aid handled which is used during validation or
       certification.
       7.1.2.11. Use dehumidifiers, desiccant packs, and/or safety-approved electric heaters in
       storage facilities to control temperature and reduce humidity.
       7.1.2.12. Contact EOD or munitions personnel if there are any doubts about the safe
       condition of any training aid.
7.2. Explosive Training Aid Acquisition, Turn-In, and Storage. KMs will maintain a full
complement of authorized training aids to maximize proficiency and operational capability. In
order to do so, follow the instructions below for the acquisition, turn-in, and storage of explosive
training aids.
   7.2.1. Sodium and Potassium Chlorates are not considered an explosive in their original
   manufactured state. However, they are an oxidizer and still require the utmost care when
   handling.
       7.2.1.1. Obtain chlorates through medical supply channels or local procurement. No less
       than three pounds of each chlorate will be maintained. It is suggested units maintain five
       to ten pounds of each chlorate in order to provide realistic Homemade Explosives (HME)
       training.
       7.2.1.2. Units may repackage chlorates as necessary to help facilitate training problems.
       Store and repackage chlorate training aids in moisture proof containers.
       7.2.1.3. Store chlorates per the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) and information
       provided on the package.
       7.2.1.4. Chlorates may be stored at the kennel facility. The storage area must be secured
       to prevent unauthorized access. Also, store in a manner to prevent cross contamination
       from the other types of chlorate and Ammonium Nitrate (AN).
       7.2.1.5. Do not mix chlorates with any other substances. The combination of chlorates
       with other substances could form an explosive or spontaneously combustible mixture.

     with local requirements.
  7.2.2. AN is also an oxidizer and must be treated with care.
     7.2.2.1. Obtain AN through local supply channels or by local procurement. No less than
     three pounds of AN will be maintained. It is suggested ten pounds be maintained to
     provide realistic HME training. No more than forty pounds of AN will be kept by any
     unit.
     7.2.2.2. Store AN similarly to chlorates and ensure it is stored as required by the MSDS
     and local requirements.
  7.2.3. The DFC will ensure:
     7.2.3.1. Training aids are available and procedures are in place for issue.
     7.2.3.2. Turn-in and storage are coordinated with the installation munitions supply
     officer.

                      KENNEL FACILITIES AND CARE OF MWDS

9.1. Kennel Facilities. A suitable MWD Kennel Facility, support equipment, and explosives
storage facilities must be available before MWDs may be shipped to an installation. Kennel
facilities require:
   9.1.1. Adequate ventilation, cooling, and heating. Kennel temperature should range from
   45 degrees Fahrenheit to 85 degrees Fahrenheit with humidity in the range of 40% to 70%.
   NOTE: MWDs work more effectively and are more alert when the kennel temperature is
   close to the temperature of their working environment. Strive to maintain a kennel
   temperature                                                                        within
   10 degrees of the exterior temperature.
   9.1.2. Minimal noise levels. Do not locate MWD Kennel Facilities near runways, taxiways,
   engine test cells, small arms ranges, or other areas where the time-weighted overall average
   sound pressure level for any 24-hour period exceeds 75 adjusted decibels.
   9.1.3. Take measures to prevent the infestation of mosquitoes, ticks, and rodents.
   9.1.4. Coordinate new construction planning documents and renovation actions with the
   supporting veterinarian, local base civil engineer, and Antiterrorism/Force Protection office.
   9.1.5. Proper kennel maintenance requires daily inspection and corrective actions for
   discrepancies. All personnel assigned to the MWD section must maintain the MWD Kennel
   Facility in accordance with AF and Army policies outlined in Field Manual (FM) 3-19.17,
   Military Working Dogs.
   9.1.6. A secure and enclosed training area is required for patrol and patrol/detector dogs for
   advanced obedience and off leash control training. The area should be close to the MWD
   Kennel Facility and meet the standards outlined in AFMAN 31-219.
   9.1.7. Post all sides of the kennel and training areas with warning signs. Use the Air Force
   Visual Aid (AFVA) 125-21, Warning Military Working Dog Area Do Not Enter. In foreign
   countries, also post signs in the primary language of the host country.
   9.1.8. Do not allow pets, stray animals, or unit mascots into the MWD facility or training
   area. Do not collocate stray animal facilities with, or operate as part of, the MWD facility.
   9.1.9. Kennel facilities will not be used to house or care for any animals other than DoD
   procured MWDs unless coordinated and approved by servicing veterinarian and MAJCOM
   PM.
9.2. Care of MWDs. Arrange duty schedules of handlers and support personnel so the MWD
Kennel Facilities are continuously staffed or so that at least one qualified handler is immediately
available. If a qualified handler is unavailable, the KM will train other personnel to assist with
facility checks and kennel support.
   9.2.1. If units have less than five MWDs or do not earn kennel support personnel, do the
   following when the MWD Kennel Facility is unattended:
AFI31-121 17 OCTOBER 2012                                                                    37


     9.2.1.1. Keep a qualified MWD handler or trained kennel attendant on call. Use on-duty
     handlers for this purpose.
     9.2.1.2. Lock the kennel facility. Keep the keys at a specific location, such as the BDOC,
     for emergency purposes.
     9.2.1.3. Check the kennel facility and each MWD at a minimum of every 4 hours or
     more frequently according to local procedures. Checks will be annotated in a log which is
     maintained at the kennels.
     9.2.1.4. Provide MWDs fresh water at each shift change.
  9.2.2. The US Army provides veterinary service for MWDs as prescribed by support
  agreements and AFJI 48-131/AR 40-905, Veterinary Health Services. Refer to AFJI 48-
  131/AR 40-905 for veterinary support and emergency veterinary care details. AFMAN 31-
  219 has additional information.
     9.2.2.1. The veterinarian and KM will establish sanitation standards and train handlers
     on first aid.
     9.2.2.2. Units must plan for veterinary care when supporting TDY commitments.
     Handlers must have contact information for a veterinarian in the local area of the TDY
     which is capable of administering emergency care if needed.
  9.2.3. Medical records kept by the veterinarian are permanent records. If the veterinarian
  does not have an office, the KM may store the records.
     9.2.3.1. Copies of all correspondence related to euthanasia are kept as part of the medical
     records.
     9.2.3.2. All medical records on deceased MWDs are sent to the 341 TRS. Veterinarians
     will also complete DD Form 1743, Death Certificate of Military Dog.
         9.2.3.2.1. The original DD Form 1743 is sent to the unit supply officer as the source
         document for removing the MWD from the unit property record. The first copy is
         filed in the MWD administrative record. A copy is also filed in the MWD medical
         records and sent to the MAJCOM MWD PM if a replacement MWD is requested.
  9.2.4. Handlers will be familiar with the MWD's normal body functions, such as appetite,
  stools, and normal attitude. Report any changes to the veterinarian and KM immediately.
  9.2.5. The US Army Veterinary Command prescribes the type and brand of ration fed to
  MWDs. Procure food through official supply or General Services Administration (GSA)
  channels unless the attending veterinarian approves a different ration.

                                         Chapter 10

                                MWD TRANSPORTATION

10.1. MWD Vehicles.
   10.1.1. MWD vehicles should be a 4-door vehicle which facilitates the MWDT to access all
   areas of the installation. When selecting vehicles, keep the most austere terrain the MWDT
   will encounter in mind. It is vitally important MWDs are able to be driven as close as
   possible to their search locations to ensure the MWD is provided maximum potential to
   succeed at the mission.
      10.1.1.1. Dedicated MWD vehicles will have a stable platform with a nonskid surface in
      the rear seat area. Use commercial canine vehicle inserts in these vehicles.
      10.1.1.2. While on patrol, the MWD should be off leash in the rear seat area.
      10.1.1.3. MWD vehicles will never be used to transport any animals other than MWDs.
          10.1.1.3.1. MWD handlers and kennel support personnel will not be used to capture
          stray animals. This is to reduce the risk of transmitting disease to the MWDs.
          10.1.1.3.2. MWDs will not be transported in any vehicle that has been used to
          transport stray animals until the vehicle has been thoroughly sanitized according to
          veterinarian instructions.
      10.1.1.4. Vehicles used to routinely transport MWDs must be climate controlled, to
      include
      air-conditioning.
      10.1.1.5. MWD vehicles used for patrol will be separate and distinct from the kennel
      support vehicle(s).
      10.1.1.6. MWDs will not be transported in the same compartment of vehicles which are
      simultaneously used for the transportation of explosive or drug training aids, unless in an
      emergency.
   10.1.2. Vehicle Markings. Mark MWD vehicles IAW TO 36-1-191, Technical and
   Managerial Reference for Motor Vehicle Maintenance, Chapter 2.84.6.4.
      10.1.2.1. In foreign countries, the vehicle markings must also be written in the language
      of the host country.
      10.1.2.2. MWD vehicles will not be identified by any markings in deployed hostile
      locations.
   10.1.3. MWDs may be transported in a portable kennel or shipping crate in the bed of a
   truck without a camper shell for short trips.
      10.1.3.1. Pickup trucks are not to be used for daily operations with the MWD in the bed.
      When using a pickup truck to transport an MWD in a portable kennel or shipping crate,
      the crate must be secured to the bed of the truck.
AFI31-121 17 OCTOBER 2012                                                                         39


   10.1.4. MWDs may be transported in privately owned vehicles (POV) with approval from
   the DFC in writing and IAW paragraph 10.1.1.3.2. of this instruction. POVs will only be
   used as a last resort, not convenience.
   10.1.5. Do not leave MWDs unattended in vehicles unless the mission requires it and there is
   no other alternative or if directed by competent authority (KM, Flight Chief, DFC, etc).
      10.1.5.1. In these situations, the MWD can only be left in a marked MWD vehicle and
      the handler must do the following to maximize the MWD’s safety:
          10.1.5.1.1. Set the parking brake.
          10.1.5.1.2. Leave the engine running.
          10.1.5.1.3. Set the thermostat for the appropriate climate and ensure fan is on high.
          10.1.5.1.4. Secure the vehicle and have a means (spare key, remote entry) to
          immediately access the vehicle if the MWD should become distressed.
          10.1.5.1.5. MWDs will be checked every 15 minutes should they be left in a vehicle
          unattended.
10.2. Shipping MWDs.
   10.2.1. A veterinary health certificate must accompany the MWD when it is shipped across
   state lines or international borders. Health certificates are valid for 10-days only. If travel is
   delayed, another certificate must be issued.
   10.2.2. When transporting MWDs in shipping crates, the shipping crates will:
      10.2.2.1. Be clearly marked and the markings large enough to read from a safe distance
      on the top and sides of the crate with ―Danger – Military Working Dog.‖
          10.2.2.1.1. Bilingual warnings will be used for the country to which the MWD is
          being shipped.
      10.2.2.2. Be marked on the top of the crate with the name and tattoo of the MWD. Also
      include 24-hour contact information and how to contact the handler accompanying the
      MWD in case of emergency.
   10.2.3. When loading shipping crates:
      10.2.3.1. Load crates for maximum ventilation and never place baggage on top of or
      around crate. Never place the crate on top of other baggage.
      10.2.3.2. Never stack crates more than two high.
      10.2.3.3. Do not load MWDs into crates which have been standing in the sun. When
      transporting MWDs in shipping crates during hot weather, use air-conditioned or well-
      ventilated vehicles.
      10.2.3.4. Make sure there is an adequate supply of fresh water for the MWDs.
      10.2.3.5. Do not lock shipping crates; however, make sure the crates cannot be opened
      inadvertently. If requested to secure the kennel crate for travel on military or civilian
      airlines, use plastic ―zip ties‖ on the four corners of the gate to the crate.
40                                                             AFI31-121 17 OCTOBER 2012


  10.2.4. When traveling with MWDs, refer to the MWDs as a ―Federal Service Dogs‖ to
  avoid confusion with federal law enforcement authorities (i.e., Transportation Safety
  Administration (TSA) airport screening checkpoints).
     10.2.4.1. When passing through a TSA screening checkpoint, if you are asked for a
     Unique Federal Agency Number (UFAN), professionally ask the TSA personnel to refer
     to the Aviation Security, Specialized Screening, Standard Operating Procedures, section
     2.3.1. (Armed or Unarmed LEOs entering the sterile area), paragraph A, subparagraph 6,
     page 2.5. It states, "An unarmed U.S. military member, accompanied by a canine, may
     be cleared into the sterile area after inspection of his or her Military Identification Card
     (DD Form 2XX), Request and Authorization for Temporary Duty travel of DoD
     Personnel (DD Form 1610), another form of Government-issued photo ID, and if flying,
     his or her travel document. A UFAN is not required."
     10.2.4.2. MWDs will travel in the cargo hold and shipped as excess baggage when
     traveling on commercial aircraft.
         10.2.4.2.1. Exceptions: There are times when an MWD will not be able to travel in
         the cargo hold of an aircraft. In these cases, the MWD may travel in the passenger
         cabin with the handler. Some of these exceptions are when a heat/cold embargo has
         been established or when airports cannot accept the size of kennel crate being used.
         10.2.4.2.2. When the MWD travels in the passenger cabin with the handler, the
         handler must ensure the MWD is muzzled and on leash. The MWD must be under
         continuous control of the handler. The handler will keep the MWD on a short safety
         leash when moving through the cabin of the aircraft.
         10.2.4.2.3. Handlers will stay with assigned MWD, as much as possible, and will
         make every effort to ensure the MWD is being loaded onto the same flight. Ask
         airline attendants prior to departure to check if the MWD is loaded into the cargo hold
         of the aircraft.
         10.2.4.2.4. Notify the MAJCOM MWD PM when the MWD must ride in the cabin
         of an aircraft.
  10.2.5. When MWDs are shipped unaccompanied, KMs will check with the base
  transportation office and complete all required forms. The shipper will attach detailed
  instructions to the crate on how to feed and water MWDs. The MWD must be attended until
  it is loaded onboard the aircraft.
  10.2.6. Handlers will escort and take care of MWDs moved on military aircraft. Contact
  local passenger service representatives for instructions.
  10.2.7. If kennel facilities are required during stopovers at other bases, coordinate in advance
  with the local KM. USAF MWDs can be housed in any kennel facility belonging to a service
  component of DoD or federal law enforcement agency.
     10.2.7.1. MWDs will never be housed in a commercial or stray animal facility.
  10.2.8. MWDs will not travel through Guam, United Kingdom, or other locations with
  animal quarantine regulations, unless the MWD is being assigned to those locations.
AFI31-121 17 OCTOBER 2012                                                                 41


  10.2.9. MWDs entering the European Union (EU) (see attachment 4) from countries not
  listed in the Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council of European Union,
  Annex II part C of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 (attachment 4) are required to be
  accompanied by:
     10.2.9.1. EU Form 998 – Veterinary Certificate for domestic dogs, cats and ferrets
     entering the European Community for non-commercial movements. Ask your veterinarian
     for a copy of the form for the specific country to which you are traveling. You can also
     contact the US State Department or the embassy of the country to which you are traveling
     and request an EU Form 998.
     10.2.9.2. Proof of a rabies neutralizing anti-body vaccination or revaccination if
     applicable per the recommendation of the manufacturing lab, with an inactivated vaccine
     of at least one antigenic unit per dose.
     10.2.9.3. A copy of the MWD’s Fluorescent Antibody Virus Neutralization (FAVN) test
     results.

                                          Chapter 11

                          DETECTOR DOG SUPPORT TO CLEA

11.1. General: Executive Orders and public law permit, and in some cases may mandate, the
DoD to provide explosive and narcotic detector dog support to CLEA for dignitary protection
and drug interdiction. As the DoD Executive Agency for MWD program management,
HQ AFSFC, through delegated authority from HQ AF/A7S, receives and processes requests for
detector dog support from the USSS, DOS, United States Marshal Service (USMS), USCS,
DEA, Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), and other non-DoD law enforcement agencies
(LEA). This chapter provides guidance on deployment of detector dog teams in support of those
requests. Unless otherwise noted, references in this chapter apply to both EDDs and DDDs.
11.2. Detector Dog Operations: Per Title 10 U.S.C. § 372, Use of military equipment and
facilities, the Secretary of Defense may make equipment available to any federal, state, or local
LEA for law enforcement purposes. Upon request, an MWD (viewed by DoD as a piece of
equipment) may be loaned to law enforcement officials. If an MWD is loaned to an LEA, its
military handler must be provided to work the MWD as they always work as a team. Depending
upon the type of support, LEAs may submit a request for EDD/DDD support in several ways.
   11.2.1. Direct Routine Requests: For short-term support (less than 30 days), an LEA may
   submit a request directly to the Installation Commander. The Installation Commander may
   approve requests that do not require funding, or for which the LEA will provide
   reimbursement, if the support does not negatively affect the installation’s operational
   requirements for military readiness. If the LEA requests DoD funding, or if the installation
   does not have the capability to provide the requested support, the request will be forwarded
   through that MAJCOM’s MWD PM to HQ AFSFC for resolution. Before providing non-
   emergency detector dog support to local government police, fire or disaster officials,
   accomplish a Civilian Support Release and Reimbursement Agreement. Coordinate the
   agreement and requests for assistance with the local SJA. See Attachment 2 for a sample
   MWD Civilian Support Release and Reimbursement Agreement.
   11.2.2. Non-direct Routine Requests: EDD teams extensively support the USSS protection
   of the President, Vice President, First Lady, and foreign heads-of-state. EDD teams also
   routinely support the DOS protection of the Secretary of State and foreign dignitaries. DDD
   teams support the DHS and DEA in the detection and monitoring of the air, land, and sea
   transit of illegal drugs. HQ AFSFC receives requests for support, validates these requests,
   and sources support from the military installation nearest the support area with detector dog
   capability, regardless of Service component. All initial sourcing is done through the Service
   component or MAJCOM MWD PM. Units that would suffer degradation of mission
   readiness through temporary loss of a detector dog will be excused from providing support
   and another unit will be tasked.
       11.2.2.1. Financial issues are not grounds to excuse a unit from providing support.
   11.2.3. Non-routine Requests: Requests for EDD support which do not meet the criteria as
   Non Direct Routine support (i.e., National Special Security Events) are submitted to the
   Office of the Secretary of Defense, Executive Secretariat (OSD/ES). The requesting agency
   will submit a letter to OSD/ES explaining the reason for support and how they will reimburse
AFI31-121 17 OCTOBER 2012                                                                    43


  the tasked unit. Once approved, OSD/ES notifies HQ AFSFC who will in-turn contact the
  responsible Service component or MAJCOM MWD PM for the DoD unit closest to the
  mission support location. MWDT rotations for extended support will be done on a ―fair-
  share‖ basis.
  11.2.4. When detector dog teams support non-DoD agencies, the following procedures will
  be followed:
     11.2.4.1. The MWD and handler must be used together.
     11.2.4.2. The handler must have exclusive control over the detection support effort and
     complete access to the search area (EDD only).
     11.2.4.3. Handlers perform the sole task of working their MWDs and will not take part in
     any other activity intended to support civil authorities unless specifically authorized by
     HQ AFSFC.
     11.2.4.4. Only the MWDT's drug or explosives detection capabilities will be used.
     MWDTs will not track suspects, seize evidence, search buildings or areas for personnel,
     or be used to pursue, bite and hold, or in any way assist in apprehending, arresting, or
     detaining persons.
     11.2.4.5. MWDTs will not be used to search persons.
     11.2.4.6. A representative of the requesting agency or civil jurisdiction must escort the
     MWDT at all times while working.
     11.2.4.7. If the MWD responds positively, the handler will advise the agency
     representative and withdraw or continue other disassociated detection support.
     11.2.4.8. An EDD handler will not disarm or move any actual or suspected explosive
     device.
     11.2.4.9. Advise the requesting agency that the DoD will not accept responsibility for
     damages resulting from the use of detector dog teams.
     11.2.4.10. Handlers will not seize or retrieve evidence, assist in setting up, or
     maintaining chain of custody, nor engage in any other activities which could be
     considered as enforcing the law in connection with this support.
     11.2.4.11. The handler may, if necessary, testify in civil court. Testimony will be limited
     to explaining the training received, the past success rates of the MWD, the events leading
     to employment in this particular detection support, and the results of that detection
     support.
     11.2.4.12. MWDTs may assist CLEA in searching for persons when it is considered
     humanitarian in nature, for example, a lost child or elderly person.
  11.2.5. On all detector dog requests, once HQ AFSFC determines a tasked unit has sufficient
  resources to provide support, a tasking message is prepared and transmitted to the responsible
  unit. The message will contain all information required to prepare TDY orders and brief
  handler(s) on requirements and responsibilities. The Commander and/or KM will ensure the
  handler(s) are thoroughly briefed on the message and provided a personal copy. Whenever
  possible, begin pre-departure preparations such as orders, canine physical and health
44                                                            AFI31-121 17 OCTOBER 2012


  certificate, etc., immediately upon notification of a tasking. Do not wait for receipt of the
  tasking message as this could create logistics problems since most requests for support have a
  very short response time.
  11.2.6. Immediately upon notification of an MWD support request, the KM will select a
  qualified MWDT. The KM will immediately notify the selected handler and provide the
  name and phone number of the requesting agency representative to contact. The handler will
  make immediate contact with the representative. If direct contact cannot be made, give a
  commercial 24-hour contact number so the representative can return the handler’s call.
     11.2.6.1. For USSS support, if voice contact is not made with the representative within
     four hours, the handler will contact the USSS Duty Desk, Washington D.C., (202) 395-
     4004, and pass their name, travel information, and 24-hour contact number.
  11.2.7. The tasked unit will also ensure the following is done as quickly as possible:
     11.2.7.1. Prepare TDY travel orders as determined by HQ AFSFC. Use of blanket or
     similar type TDY orders is not authorized when traveling in support of the President or
     Vice President of the United States. EDD handlers may be diverted or assigned another
     mission immediately after completing the initial mission. Ensure orders reflect
     ―Variations Authorized.‖
     11.2.7.2. If travel requires crossing any state line or country boundary, arrange for
     immediate veterinary physical and health certificate for the MWD tasked to support the
     mission. The MWD’s health records and current health certificate will accompany the
     handler while away from home station.
     11.2.7.3. Make travel arrangements for the handler and MWD. The MWDT will drive to
     the support area if within driving distance. The MAJCOM providing support will
     coordinate with HQ AFSFC as to whether the MWDT should drive or fly.
     11.2.7.4. Contact the requesting agency representative and pass all information
     concerning travel arrangements and arrival time. Do not use the large metal mobility type
     crate for these type deployments.
     11.2.7.5. A minivan or sport utility vehicle is the standard for use by EDD and DDD
     teams. Government vehicles are only to be used with the approval of the requesting
     agency representative.
     11.2.7.6. Ensure handlers take sufficient dog food, an extra leash, choke chain, reward
     food, and medication (as applicable) for the duration of the TDY. All MWD handlers will
     ensure they have a muzzle available at all times throughout the mission.
  11.2.8. Once at the mission location, detector dog teams will fall under the operational
  control of the supported agency.
     11.2.8.1. The senior MWD handler will act as the military supervisor and assist the
     supported agency supervisor(s) as needed. During the security operation briefing (EDD)
     or mission orientation briefing (DDD), appropriate agencies will distribute identification
     media and equipment. Handlers will ensure OPSEC and security of the equipment at all
     times.
AFI31-121 17 OCTOBER 2012                                                                     45


         11.2.8.1.1. If confusion or a disagreement on how to search an area occurs, the senior
         handler will meet with the supported agency representative and attempt to resolve the
         issue. If a resolution cannot be reached, the MWDT will proceed as directed, unless
         the safety of the MWDT would be compromised. In cases of a breach in safety,
         contact the USAF MWD PM immediately.
     11.2.8.2. Any identification designed at home station for the sole purpose of identifying
     the MWDT as a DoD MWDT will not be used when supporting these missions. Orders
     will reflect the handler is traveling with a federal service animal and official credentials
     will be issued upon arrival at the TDY location if necessary.
     11.2.8.3. Ensure the presence of a support agency representative or EOD technician at all
     times when the DDD or EDD team is searching. If an EDD responds, the handler will
     terminate the search and stand-by outside the affected area. Handlers will not handle or
     maintain custody of any explosive devices or drugs discovered.
     11.2.8.4. The EDD teams will only search for explosive devices and will not perform
     duties that may conflict with requirements established under the Posse Comitatus Act.
     DDD teams can only search for drug contraband.
  11.2.9. Male EDD handlers will wear conservative dark colored business suits. Female EDD
  handlers will wear conservative business suits with slacks in lieu of skirts. Certain missions
  require casual clothing or coveralls. Casual clothing is defined as dress slacks/khakis and
  long/short sleeve collared shirts.
     11.2.9.1. At no time will handlers wear jeans, shorts, tennis shoes, or shirts with
     offensive language or logos while performing official duties. Military dress and
     appearance standards will be maintained throughout the duration of the TDY.
     11.2.9.2. The tasking message will identify clothing requirements. EDD handlers are
     authorized a civilian clothing allowance. Refer to DoD Financial Management
     Regulation (FMR) 7000.14R, Military Pay Policy and Procedures Active Duty and
     Reserve Duty, Volume 7A, Clothing Monetary Allowances, paragraph 290403 on the
     publications website.
         11.2.9.2.1. It is suggested the DFC authorize initial civilian clothing allowance upon
         the initial certification of a handler as an EDD team. All recurring civilian clothing
         allowances will adhere to appropriate regulations.
  11.2.10. Handlers currently assigned and validated with an MWD will have an Official
  Passport and a current Defense Travel System (DTS) account. Taskings to support Outside
  the Continental United States (OCONUS) missions are common and rarely have sufficient
  advance notice to process a passport application. Complete and process an official passport
  application for handlers immediately upon their assignment to the unit. Contact local Military
  Personnel Flight (MPF) for guidance.
  11.2.11. Weapons of any type, including privately owned weapons, are prohibited while
  performing duties with any non-DoD agency unless directed otherwise by HQ AFSFC.
  11.2.12. IAW DoD FMR 7000.14.R, Volume 9, Chapter 3, Department of Defense
  Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC), paragraph 0301, each MWD Handler must
46                                                           AFI31-121 17 OCTOBER 2012


  possess a Government Sponsored Travel Card, unless exempted as prescribed by DoD FMR
  Volume 9, paragraph 030601.
  11.2.13. Accomplish a detailed after action report of the incident and forward it through the
  MAJCOM MWD PM to USAF MWD PM as soon as possible.
  11.2.14. Both EDD and DDD handlers will adhere to all safety practices at all times.
     11.2.14.1. Do not leave MWDs unattended in vehicles, except in an emergency. If a rare
     situation arises when you must leave an MWD unattended in a vehicle, ensure the MWD
     remains in view at all times and that adequate ventilation is provided.
     11.2.14.2. MWDs will remain on leash at all times while searching. MWDs will be
     muzzled while traveling to and from search areas. Handlers will make every attempt to
     ensure areas they will search are cleared of non-essential personnel.
     11.2.14.3. If you must leave an MWD unattended in a hotel room, secure it in the travel
     crate, and post the hotel ―Do Not Disturb‖ sign on the door exterior to deter anyone from
     entering the room. Report damage caused by the MWD to a hotel room to the supported
     agency representative and the MAJCOM MWD PM immediately.
  11.2.15. After-action reports are only required when significant events occur during the
  mission. Handlers can submit optional reports to recognize positive or negative aspects of
  the mission. When prepared, send a copy of after-action reports to the USAF MWD PM
  through the MAJCOM MWD PM.
