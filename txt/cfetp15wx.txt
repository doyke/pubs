                          CAREER FIELD EDUCATION AND TRAINING PLAN

PREFACE
1. The July 2010 15W Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW) drove significant and necessary
changes to the 15W career field. Six distinct mission areas (Operational Weather Squadron (OWS), AF
weather flight, Army weather support, AF Space weather support, Special Operations Weather Team
(SOWT) and Staff support) have always been recognized within the career field and the U&TW formally
advanced this concept. Our efforts officially distinguished requirements for each mission area and time in
an officer’s career. Force Development is designed to link training and education opportunities to
assignment experience; connect individual goals to AF needs, invest the right education and training
experience in the right officers at the right time, and to enhance leadership and officer understanding to
best utilize individual officer inputs in the development and assignment process. Most successful careers
have one thing in common: a good combination of depth (significant expertise in a core area) and breadth
(experience across multiple missions that complement core knowledge and/or officer growth).

The Weather Officer Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education
and training document that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements and training support
resources. It is the vehicle used to communicate force development guidance to grow future weather
leaders as well as provide a “training roadmap” that identifies mandatory and optional skill-level training.
The CFETP provides force development guidance that the AFPC assignment team uses to make informed
decisions throughout your career progression. Upon selection for Major, the Development Team adds
rigor to the process and then provides career vectors and Developmental Assignment opportunities which
AFPC will use to match officers to future assignments. The primary objective is to ensure that as officers
progress through their career, they remain tied to strong weather fundamentals and disciplines and gain
the skills/expertise needed to meet the demands across the weather spectrum. NOTE: Civilians
occupying associated positions will use Part II to support duty position qualification training.

2. The CFETP consists of two parts:

2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A, General
Information, explains the purpose and uses of the CFETP. Section B, 15W Progression and Information,
explains career job progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career
field path. Section C, Proficiency Training Requirements, associates each level with specialty
qualifications (knowledge, education, experience, and other mandatory requirements). Section D,
Resources Constraints, identifies all resource constraints that will impact the execution of education and
training such as funds, manpower, equipment, and facilities.

2.2. Part II contains a comprehensive listing of training courses and standards available to support 15W
training requirements. Section A, Formal Training Courses, lists all mandatory AF in-residence, field,
HQ AU/A4L, and exportable courses used to support training. Section B, Resource Constraints, There
are currently no resource constraints. Section C, Specialty Training Standard (STS), identifies qualitative
and qualification training requirements, available formal or correspondence courses, and 15W proficiency
levels.

3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective and
efficient training at the appropriate points in their career. This plan enables AFW to train today’s weather
warriors for tomorrow’s missions.



                                                     4
4. Training Decisions. All major training decisions are made at U&TWs or through electronic media with
concurrence from a majority of MAJCOM Functional Managers. Any training decision needed prior to
the next U&TW will be coordinated with all MAJCOM FMs. This CFETP was developed using past
U&TW minutes. The CFM & Training Manager maintains copies of past U&TW minutes.




                                                  5
PART I

Section A - GENERAL INFORMATION

1. Purpose. This CFETP provides information necessary for AFCFMs, MAJCOM functional managers
(MFM), training managers, commanders, supervisors, trainers, and technical training centers to plan,
develop, manage and conduct an effective 15W career field training program. Except where noted, this
CFETP applies to active duty and reserve component (Guard and Reserve) officers holding a 15W AFSC.

1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.
Used by commanders and supervisors to identify training at the appropriate point in an officer’s career.

1.2. Identifies requirements for each certification level and recommends education and training for each
phase of an individual’s career.

1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies training sources, and the training medium.

1.4. Establishes force development guidance the AFPC assignment team uses to allocate assignments.

1.5. Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the optimal career field
training process.

2. CFETP Uses and Responsibilities. Commanders and supervisors at all levels will use this plan to
ensure a comprehensive and cohesive training program is instituted for each officer in this specialty.

2.1. AETC training personnel will develop/revise formal resident, non-resident, field, and exportable
training based on user requirements established by the users and documented in this CFETP. AETC will
work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the
identified training. The AFCFM and 335 TRS Training Manager are the custodians of this CFETP and
ensure HQ AFPC/DPPAT receives approved revisions for publication.

2.2. The AFCFM determines the training requirements for AETC-developed formal training courses as
well as the requirements and content of the CFETP. The AFCFM determines the need for, schedules, and
chairs the Utilization and Training Workshop. Training requirements are determined in partnership with
the MAJCOMs and AETC training pipeline manager. Additionally, the AFCFM is the waiver authority
for any training requirements in this CFETP.

2.3. MAJCOM functional managers ensure training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial,
upgrade, and proficiency requirements. Identified requirements can be satisfied by AETC resident, OJT,
contract training, or exportable courseware/courses. MAJCOM-unique training to support this AFSC
must be identified for inclusion in this plan and should not duplicate available training.

2.4. Commanders, immediate supervisors, and trainers will manage and control progression through the
career field by ensuring each officer completes the mandatory training requirements for upgrade specified
in this plan as supplemented by their MAJCOM. The list of courses in Part II, Section A, will be used as
a reference to determine training required. Commanders should also take advantage of opportunities to
broaden 15W officers’ background.

2.5. Commanders will monitor the effectiveness of weather training; notify MAJCOMs of formal training
shortfalls to ensure timely correction and redirection of formal training emphasis and ensure the best
possible training environment for weather officers. Each weather officer will complete the mandatory

                                                      6
training requirements specified in this plan. Commanders, or equivalent, are responsible for ensuring
their assigned officers meet the requirements of the CFETP. Commander (or higher authority) will certify
the officer’s progression by documenting task completion on the “Training Completion Certification”
sheet in the CFETP or documented in AFTR.

2.6. Individual 15W officers use this CFETP to determine training requirements and understand the career
field development paths and opportunities. Each 15W officer will complete the mandatory follow-on
training requirements specified in this plan and as specified by the unit. Specific instructions for follow-
on training are described in Part II, Section A. The CFETP serves as the training record for the individual
officer (AFTR is suitable substitute for CFETP) and is to be maintained as part of their career
development by the commander. Once the officer has met all Master Certification, training
documentation will be returned to the individual for personal disposition.

3. Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is the approval authority in accordance with (IAW) AFI
36-2201, Air Force Training Program. Forward recommended changes to the AFCFM, HQ USAF/A3O-
W. MAJCOM requests for additional training must either be accompanied by funding or must be
satisfied within existing resources.       MAJCOM representatives and AETC training personnel will
identify and coordinate career field training requirements. The AFCFM for this specialty will conduct an
annual review of this document with AETC agencies, HQ AFWA, and MFMs to ensure currency and
accuracy. The AFCFM will ensure the training resources identified in the CFETP do not result in
redundant or unnecessary training.

Section B - Career Progression and Information

Purpose. This section provides information for career field functional managers, commanders,
supervisors, training managers, trainers, and the technical training centers to plan career field progression
in the weather officer specialty. It also describes the functions and responsibilities of the 15W AFSC.

1. The Weather Career Field.

1.1. Weather Specialty Summary. Commands, manages, and performs weather operations for Air Force
and Army activities. Integrates current and forecast atmospheric and space weather conditions into
operations and operational planning. Develops, directs, and coordinates meteorological and space
weather studies and research. Supports and executes weather operations through leadership and
management of weather centers, groups, squadrons, weather flights/detachments. Supports Air Force
core weather responsibility to provide meteorological and space weather information for DoD air, ground,
and space operations. Related DoD Occupational Group: 250200.

1.2. Skill and Career Progression: Continuous training and timely progression from the entry level to
the staff officer level plays an important role in the Air Force’s ability to accomplish its mission. It is
essential that all personnel involved in training do their part to plan, manage, and conduct an effective
training program. The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure each individual receives
viable training at appropriate points in their career. Although all personnel have a responsibility for
training and development, certain key individuals in the work center will be primarily responsible for
continuously improving skill proficiency by exploiting training opportunities. These individuals include
members of the OWS Training Flight; commanders and supervisors; the Unit Training Manager;
individuals appointed as trainers and/or task certifiers; and the individual trainee. Section A lists specific
mandatory training requirements for each level within the weather specialty.

2.1. Skill Levels

                                                      7
2.1.1. Entry Level (15W1). IAW AFI 36-2101, Air Force Training Program, Initial Skills Training (IST)
must be completed within 6 months of entering active duty unless restricted by lack of security clearance
or other extenuating circumstances. Upon successful completion of the 15W AETC IST Weather Officer
Course (WOC), graduates will be awarded the entry level “15W1” AFSC. Initial assignments at an
Operational Weather Squadron provide opportunities to establish and build depth of knowledge and
technical expertise with this meteorology discipline. Commanders are responsible for exposing new
officers to the entire mission of their units. Entry level officers should thoroughly understand all
requirements within the 15W Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP). Entry level positions
include, but are not limited to Ops Floor Forecaster, Zone Boss, Graphics Forecaster, and Shift
Supervisor.

2.1.2. Qualified Level (15W3). Upon meeting the mandatory requirements described in paragraph 2.1.1,
trained/certified on all 15W3 core tasks and minimum of 12 months experience at an OWS the officer
will be awarded the 15W3 classification. At this time, the Weather Officer will receive Aeronautical
Meteorological Forecaster (AMF) Certification. Prior to initial assignment (post OWS assignment) at
Air Force or Army installations, weather officers are required to complete the distance learning and in-
residence Advanced Weather Courses. If assigned to an Army unit, officers are required to attend the
Battlefield Weather Course (all officers can attend). Qualified level assignments include wing weather
officer, OSS weather flight OIC, Detachment Commander, staff officer, Senior Ops Floor Duty Officer,
Section OIC and various other positions at flight, squadron, wing, FOA, and MAJCOM levels at USAF
and USA installations. Responsibilities at the flight level include providing tailored weather analyses,
forecasts, and predictions of mission impacts to enhance the effectiveness of military operations and
training. Qualified level weather officers lead Journeyman and Craftsman level enlisted weather Airman
and NCOs. They are meteorological experts and apply their knowledge of weapons systems, tactics, and
weather sensitivities to enable commanders to mitigate and exploit the impact of environmental
conditions. They develop proficiency in basic combat field skills, including tactical weather and
communications equipment operation and operator maintenance. They maintain readiness and deploy in
support of war fighter operations. Weather Battlefield Airmen are Air Force weather forces specially
trained and equipped to execute the weather operations in the forward battle space independent of
established airbase or its perimeter defenses in support of Army combat operations. They provide tailored
analyses, forecasts and predictions of mission impact during the intelligence preparation of the battlefield
and military decision making process to enhance the effectiveness of military operations and training.
Weather Battlefield Officers assigned to units with an airborne mission receive additional mission-
specific training and experience.

2.1.2.1 Aeronautical Meteorological Forecaster (AMF) Certification. To maintain this certification an
Air Force Weather Officer will perform a minimum of 100 hours of operational forecasting/observing
duties per year documented using AFTR. In addition, the officer will successfully complete an AFW
forecasting/observation written examination (score 70% or higher). Failure to complete both of the above
requirements will result in decertification. In order to gain recertification AFW officer will complete 200
hours of operational forecasting/observing and successfully pass the written examination (score 70% or
higher). NOTE: AFW Officers in a non-traditional AFW unit not able to perform 100 hours of
forecasting/observing will complete the mandatory CBTs as noted on the AFWKC and successfully pass
the written examination.

2.1.3. Staff Level (15W4). IAW AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel. (NOTE: Designation of
“staff level” relates only to the level of functional responsibility and is restricted to positions above wing
                                                      8
level. It does not denote additional specialty qualifications.) Officers assigned to staff level assignments
at MAJCOMs or equivalent organizations (e.g., Field Operating Agencies and Major Army Commands)
and to Headquarters U.S. Air Force lead weather officer and enlisted forces, manage programs and
resources, and develop policy and procedures to ensure current and future capabilities meet Air Force and
DoD requirements. They organize, train, and equip weather forces and tailor resources and capabilities to
support combatant commanders. Staff level officers provide technical and operational leadership, and
direct development and utilization of the officer and enlisted forces.

2.1.4. Advanced Academic Degree Suffix (A). Award of the suffix is contingent upon meeting all
requirements for award as defined in AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel.

2.1.5. Special Operations Weather Suffix (C). In addition to 15W3 knowledge requirements,
knowledge of advanced field skills, environmental reconnaissance tactics, techniques and procedures, and
leadership of small unit tactical operations in the joint special operations arena.

2.2. Meteorology Badge Certification.

2.2.1. Basic Certification. IAW AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel, the following are
mandatory for basic certification: Completion of a formal AETC entry-level training course/WOC, 12
months of operational experience completed at an Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) and completion
of OWS Qualification Training (QT) requirements.

2.2.1.1. After broadening their knowledge, experience and expertise within the 15W career field,
Development Assignment (DA) opportunities should be considered. Primary DA cross flow should be
into Army support, but other opportunities include AETC instructor, AFIT, Weather Flight CC or Space.
Timing and needs of the AF as well as individual goals will determine DA opportunities for each
individual. Officers should try to broaden their scope of Weather career field opportunities and not get
pigeon holed into one path.

2.2.1.2. Company grade officers have Development Education (DE) opportunities for Squadron Officer
School (SOS). Additional DA and DE opportunities are continually evolving so it is highly
recommended the officer check the Force Development web page located at
https://www.dp.hq.af.mil/dpx/dpxf/fd_home.htm for the most current information, and officers should
communicate assignment/development desires through their Airman Development Plan (ADP).

2.2.2. Senior Certification. An officer will be eligible for the senior level at the 7-year point in the
specialty, provided he/she has completed the education and training requirements specified in Table 2.
Officers should strive to complete CFETP core requirements within 48 months of being assigned to a
15W position. With prior coordination and approval from CFM, ARC members may extend this
requirement to 60 months to accommodate their unique time availability constraints. All CFETP
requirements must be completed for the officer to be eligible for the award of the senior certification.

2.2.2.1. At the field grade level, an officer will continue to broaden expertise while strengthening their
background in weather through leadership and staff assignments. During this time they should pursue
those opportunities that make them viable for command and other key senior weather officer positions.
DE and DA opportunities for field grade officers are evolving. Check the Force Development web page
located at https://www.dp.hq.af.mil/dpx/dpxf/fd_home.htm for the most current information.

                                                     9
2.2.2.2. DE Opportunities for Majors include, but are not limited to Air Command and Staff College,
Army Command and Staff College, Marine Command and Staff College, AF Institute of Technology
(AFIT), AF Intern Program, and specified advance academic programs. DE opportunities for Lt Col
include but are not limited to Air War College, Army War College, Naval War College, National Defense
University, Industrial College of the Armed Forces and specified advanced academic programs.

2.2.3. Master Certification. An officer will be eligible for the Master certification at the 15 year point in
the specialty, provided he/she has completed the education and training requirements specified in Table 2.
Officers within this level of competency are ready to assume broader leadership roles.

2.2.4. Space Badge. A limited number of 15W personnel working in space positions are authorized to
wear the space badge. These positions require specialized space knowledge and/or training. Officers
should check with their unit leadership and/or the AFSPC Space and Cyberspace Professional
Management Office (SCPMO) to get requirements. Officers should also be aware that some enlisted
1W0 positions are also authorized to wear the space badge per similar certification requirements.

The AFSPC SCPMO is the POC on all space badge concerns (e-mail: afspc.spmo@peterson.af.mil).

3. 15W Career Progression. Experience and knowledge in this Air Force specialty will help officers
plan and achieve their Air Force career goals as Weather Officers. There are certain jobs or experiences
in this discipline that will assist them in meeting individual goals (Table 1).

3.1. All facets of weather support provide ample opportunities to supervise airmen of all ranks and
experience levels. It is common to find Weather Officers leading and supervising as few at 5 technicians
to as many as 30 on their first assignment. Several permanent changes of station (PCS) moves are
normally required for you to experience the breadth of weather opportunities to sufficient depth. When
contemplating such a move, keep in mind the following:

        3.1.1. Broadening to Army or Space Weather support to obtain experience down another path our
        career field offers. This will give officers a broad view of the differences between the services
        and support requires.

        3.1.2. Short-tour overseas assignments represent prime opportunities to quickly fill gaps in your
        professional development, and to hone skills in a typical austere environment.

        3.1.3. A change in major command (MAJCOM); be mindful of the fact that experience in several
        different MAJCOMs will give you a broader view of the total Air Force mission and a deeper
        understanding of how all the “pieces” fit together. This knowledge will lay the foundation for
        success on the Air Staff or Joint Staff.

3.2. Upon completion of the second tour, a variety of new options become available. You have the
opportunity to:

        3.2.1. Concentrate on building depth by leading a larger flight/detachment.

        3.2.2. Compete for Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) Degree Programs.                Officers
        graduating from these programs are typically assigned to a staff positions.


                                                     10
        3.2.3. Career broaden into an Air Force Special Duty, Identified with an Air Force Specialty
        Code (AFSC). Opportunities such as: United States Air Force Academy (USAFA), Reserve
        Officer
        Training Corps (ROTC), Squadron Officers School (SOS), and Officer Training School (OTS)
        instructors, Recruiting Flight Commander, command and control operations, and operations
        support officers. These jobs are available to a limited number of Weather Officers. Release is
        contingent on career field dynamics and officers return to their “core” AFSC following the career
        broadening tour.

3.3. The technical foundation you build early in your career will pay great dividends as a staff officer.
Staff billets above the wing level for weather officers are available at NAF, MAJCOM, HQ Air Force,
joint service agencies, Direct Reporting Unit (DRU), and field operating agencies.

3.4. A certain percentage of those officers selected for major will be identified as candidates for resident
Intermediate Developmental Education (IDE). Many IDE students will go to a challenging joint-duty staff
assignment, commander, MAJCOM, or Air Staff level job upon graduation. Officers not afforded the
opportunity to attend Professional Military Education (PME) in residence must complete PME by
correspondence or seminar to remain competitive in their Air Force career progression.

3.5. Command billets exist at several levels. Captains can compete for detachment commander positions;
majors and lieutenant colonels can compete for squadron command positions. Assignments for lieutenant
colonels include opportunities to serve as squadron commanders, joint duty positions, higher headquarter
staff positions, and as ROTC detachment commanders.

3.6. Officers selected for promotion to lieutenant colonel or colonel will also have the opportunity to vie
for in-residence attendance at SDE. Upon graduation, officers may be assigned to the Air Staff, joint-duty
billets, or chosen for command at the group level. How well you do in your current job is the most
important factor in determining your future opportunities.

service information line (CSIL) has been installed for the supervisors’ convenience. For a quick response
to concerns, call our CSIL at DSN 597-4566, or fax us at DSN 597-3790, or e-mail us at 81trg-
tget@us.af.mil. Reference this STS and identify the specific area of concern (paragraph, training standard
element, etc.).

Section A – Formal Training Courses

1. Purpose. Establish training standards for the 15W formal training courses:

1.1. Behavioral statements and task requirements. These are based on an analysis of the duties contained
herein and validated by the U&TW. The qualitative requirements for each task are based on the
proficiency values listed on the Proficiency Code Key.

1.2. Graduate Assessment Survey. Unit supervisors will submit responses to Graduate Assessment
Surveys (GAS) and Field Evaluation Questionnaires (FEQ) on officers who complete the formal WOC
training at Keesler AFB. Respond to GASs and FEQs when received from the technical training group
(81 TRG). (Reference AFI 36-2201)

2. Records Documentation. CFETP will be issued at first duty station. Completion of training will be
documented and certified. SQ/CC will document WOC training completion in the officer’s CFETP in the
table at Attachment 1, Training Completion Certification. Supervisors will document follow-on unit
training using the Training Task List table in Part II, Section A. The officer’s squadron commander is
responsible for certifying that the officer has completed all formal training and is task knowledgeable.
The commander will document this in the table at Attachment 1, Training Completion Certification. AF
Electronic Training Record (AFTR) can replace the CFETP for documentation of training.

3. Weather Officer AFSC Awarding Course. All 15W accession officers will attend WOC. This
course is waiverable by the CFM.

3.1. Weather Officer Course. This course is required initial skills training for all 15W officers.

and concepts of weather communications.

4. Weather Officer Non-AFSC Awarding Courses.

4.1. Weather Flight/Detachment Operations Course. The Weather Flight/Detachment Operations
Course (WFDO) is a prerequisite for an assignment at a Weather Flight (WF). This course will improve
the officer’s ability to provide tactical weather support, which in turn will enhance the warfighter’s
decision-making process and ability to conduct operations. The officer will be instructed in specific WF
value-added support tasks that provide the warfighter the tactical advantages based on knowledge of
impacts of weather on friendly and threat forces. These tasks are outlined in the CFETP Task Training
List. This course is being replaced with the new Advanced Weather Exploitation and Integration Course
(AWEIC).

                                                    15
4.2. Advanced Weather Exploitation and Integration Course (AWEIC) (Projected Start 30 Apr
2012). The Advance Weather Exploitation and Integration Course is a prerequisite for an assignment at
a Weather Flight or Army Detachment. This course will improve the officer’s ability to provide tactical
weather support, which in turn will enhance the warfighter’s decision-making process and ability to
conduct operations. The officers will be instructed in specific weather impacts to all aspects of aviation
and base support. The course consists mainly of lab type instruction putting the officer in airframe
specific situations. Enhancing their ability to bring a more warrior focused ability to the warfighter.

4.3. Weather Flight/Detachment Officer Course (WFDO) (Distance Learning). The Weather Flight
/Detachment Officer Course is a prerequisite for an assignment at a Weather Flight or Army Detachment.
This course focuses on Joint Doctrine, organization of forces, employing weather forces, chain of
command vs functional management and tactical equipment operations. This course will improve a
junior officer’s familiarity with running a weather flight or army detachment as a flight commander or
OIC.

4.4. Weather Officer Leadership Role/Responsibilities and Processes Course (Distance Learning)
(Projected Start FY12). The Weather Officer Leadership Role/Responsibilities and Processes Course is
a prerequisite for an assignment as a Flight Commander at a Weather Flight or OIC at an Army
Detachment. This course will improve the junior officer’s ability to provide outstanding leadership to his
weather warriors, a confident officer to the OSS or Detachment Commander and finally he/she will
understand their role in the weather career field. The course content will focus on doctrine, organization
of forces, employing weather forces, chain of command, staff work, etc.,.

4.5. WSR-88D OPUP Operator/Manager Course (Keesler AFB). Provides training in the knowledge
and skills needed to operate and interpret data from the WSR-88D Weather Radar System using the Open
Principle User Processor (OPUP). The scope of training includes operational theory of the WSR-88D,
operation of the OPUP, interpreting WSR-88D products, and operational and equipment management of
the OPUP.

4.6. Tropical Weather Analysis and Forecasting Course (Keesler AFB). Provides training in the
knowledge and skills needed to prepare tropical weather forecasts. This course is a Distance learning
course.

4.7. Battlefield Airmen Course. Currently all 15W army support officers will attend this course either
prior to their first army support assignment or while assigned to an army support unit. This course
provides training in the knowledge and skill to operate in an army centered assignment.

4.8. JIT training opportunities (Hurlburt AFB). As courses and times vary it is advised that officers
contact 2 CWSS at Hurlburt AFB to see what courses are being taught. These courses are meant to fill
training gaps for individuals getting ready to deploy.

5. Air Force Weather Knowledge Center (AFWKC) Training. There are over 80 different training
opportunities available on the AFWKC. These include computer based training modules, COMET
courses and informational type documents. These training resources should be used throughout your
career to develop and broaden your knowledge base. This link (https://afwkc.csd.disa.mil) will lead you
to this valuable source of material.

6. Follow-On Unit Training. Follow-on Unit Training is designed to teach new officers how concepts
presented at technical school instruction are applied at the unit level.
                                                     16
6.1. Concept. Ideally officers should complete AETC formal training prior to unit training. The intent of
follow-on unit training is to provide a local training plan to familiarize officers with unit specific
procedures and operations. Follow-on unit training consists of the core tasks and local knowledge or
tasks. Officers will not be upgraded to a fully qualified level until satisfactorily completing both AETC
formal training and CFETP core tasks. Successful occurrence does not necessarily constitute
understanding of the training objective, but it should provide the individual with a basic understanding of
subject areas.

6.2. Training plan. The instructional design for unit level training is determined locally. Appropriate
lesson plans, support materials, and trainer guidance are the responsibility of each unit. Unit training may
include work center and field visits, task observations, classroom instruction, self-study,
supervisor/commander interaction to meet training objectives.

6.3. Training Period. The unit must structure and conduct training to ensure the officer completes all
training within 24 months (may be extended to 36 months for ARC) after assignment to a 15W position.

6.4. Familiarization Training and Workcenter Visits. Officers must be scheduled to observe
familiarization tasks from start to finish. Supervisors will ensure pre-task, task, and post-task actions are
included. Training may be conducted concurrent with team training operations or during routine
operations. Trainers/supervisors will ensure officers understand the fundamentals of each task, why it is
performed, associated hazards, and the overall impact. Unit training should also include work center
visits.

7. Air Force Enlisted Career Development Courses.

7.1. Officers are eligible to enroll into CDCs and the enrollment process is simple for officers wanting or
needing to take a CDC. Enrollment is processed through MILPDS at the base education office or through
the unit training manager who has MILPDS access, as a “voluntary enrollment” in the system, just as a
PME enrollment is requested.

7.2. Enlisted CDCs are exceptional sources of both technical and process information and can greatly
increase the technical competency of the 15W CGO workforce. Officers should pursue these outstanding
courses, as they apply to their duties, to deepen their technical knowledge and commanders are
encouraged to leverage these resources and integrate them into their officers’ training plan. If enrollment
problems are encountered, email AF.A4LWworkflow@pentagon.af.mil, attention, “15W Career Field
Manager AO”.

8. Advanced Academic Degree (AAD). There are three avenues for weather officers to pursue AADs.
Interested officers should consult their Commanders.

8.1. Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT). AFIT is the Air Force’s premier institution of
professional and graduate education in acquisition, logistics, engineering, and management, space and
atmospheric meteorology. The AFIT Meteorology Graduate Program provides a broad and diverse
curriculum equipping students with the skills required to perform most effectively as middle and upper
managers in any of a variety of USAF and DoD weather positions. AFIT is at Wright Patterson AFB,
OH.

8.2. Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). NPS is the Navy’s premier institution of professional and
graduate education in meteorology. The curriculum at NPS will provide qualified personnel with a sound
understanding of the science of meteorology.



                                                      17
8.3. Civilian Institutions Postgraduate School (CI). There are opportunities for officers to attend
civilian institution to earn a Masters Degree in Meteorology. These are approved after a review by the
Career Field Manager.
