1. Objectives: Improve base appearance and perform wing-wide details by utilizing a
previously untapped workforce. The “Thunder Pride” team is assigned to the 56 CES/CC. This
team also provides an alternate work place for military personnel unable to work within their
unit. Based upon squadron commander determination, all 56 FW members that can no longer

accomplish their primary duties or other prescribed unit duties will be assigned to the team.
Extenuating circumstances may prevent squadron commanders from assigning members to the
team. In these cases, waivers will be routed through the 56 FW/CCC for 56 FW/CV approval.
2. Definitions:
     2.1. “Thunder Pride” team. Includes enlisted personnel (E-6 and below) assigned to units
     within the 56 FW who are unable to perform regular duties within their unit. These
     personnel are temporarily assigned to the 56 CES/CEO to perform a variety of base details.
     NCOs assigned to the program will be assigned duties commensurate with their rank such as
     leader in charge of detail personnel. In extreme circumstances where SNCOs are directed to
     the program, they will also perform duties commensurate with their rank such as assistant
     manager or project manager.
     2.2. Base Details. These are temporary tasks with wing-wide impact beyond the
     responsibility or capability of any one unit. These details are traditionally assigned to and
     accomplished by 56 CES/CEO.

     3.2. No service member will be assigned to the team for more than 60 days unless the
     service member’s unit has no other viable option but to keep the member on the “Thunder
     Pride” team. Anytime a servicemember is to remain on the “Thunder Pride” team for more
     than 60 days,     56 FW/JA must be notified by respective unit CC as to the reasons for the
