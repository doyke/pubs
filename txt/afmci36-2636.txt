SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This AFMCI has been revised to update the roles and responsibilities of the Center DP in the
areas of strategic management of manpower, personnel, and force development programs. The
roles and responsibilities of AFMC Force Support Squadrons (FSS) (formerly the Mission
Support Squadrons (MSS)) were deleted; the roles and responsibilities of AFMC FSSs should
align to those normally expected at all AF installations. The number of this AFMCI has been
changed from AFMCI 36-401 to AFMCI 36-2636 to avoid confusion with a similiarly
numbered, yet unrelated, Air Force Instruction (AFI).
1. Background. On 3 February 2004, AFMC/CC directed a center-level DP organization be
established to discharge responsibilities for force planning, policy, programming, and resourcing.
In addition, by memorandum 6 April 2004, the Secretary of the Air Force delegated civilian
appointing authority under Title 5, U.S.C., Section 302, to Air Force Materiel Command Center
Commanders rather than to relevant AFMC Installation Commanders. By memorandum 23
February 2005, HQ USAF/DPP approved AFMC’s request to authorize the Center DP to
administer the Center Commander’s Title 5, U.S.C. civilian appointing authority on behalf of the
Center Commander as the Civilian Personnel Officer (CPO). On 18 Jun 12, an Organizational
Change Request (OCR) was approved outlining an AFMC reorganization from 12 Centers, 8 of
which had Commanders with delegated Title 5, U.S.C. civilian appointing authority, to 5
Centers. Due to this reorganization, with the resultant elimination of Center commanders at five
installations (Arnold, Eglin, Hanscom, Hill, and Robins AFBs), the 6 April 2004 memorandum
was rescinded, returning Title 5, U.S.C. civilian appointing authority to the AFMC Installation
Commanders. Likewise, the 23 February 2005 memorandum was rescinded, returning
authorization to administer Title 5, U.S.C. civilian appointing authority and the CPO to AFMC
FSSs (Note 1: Title 5, U.S.C. civilian appointing authority at Arnold AFB is held by the Arnold
Engineering Development Complex (AEDC) Commander and administered by the CPO within
AEDC/DP).
     1.1. Title 5, U.S.C..
1.1.1. Title 5, U.S.C. civilian appointing authority resides with the Installation Commanders.
This authority cannot be further delegated.
        1.1.2. The FSS/FSMC Chief within the host Wing/Group is designated as the Civilian
        Personnel Officer responsible and accountable to administer the Title 5, U.S.C.
        appointing authority for the Installation Commander. Responsibility for administration
        of the appointing authority cannot be assigned to any other position.
        1.1.3. Refer to Note 1 concerning Title 5, U.S.C. authority and administration for Arnold
        AFB.
2. Roles and Responsibilities. While the general parameters outlined below serve as guidance,
the Center DP Director retains the flexibility and authority to make workforce allocation
decisions throughout the Directorate based upon the needs of the organization. Reasons for
deviation from the guidance can include, but are not limited to, shifts in work priorities,
synergies gained through work process efficiencies, and work assigned to the Directorate that is
not included in this AFMCI.
