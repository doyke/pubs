The Department of Defense (DoD) Reclamation Program is prescribed by DOD 4140.1-R, DOD
Supply Chain Materiel Management Regulation and is implemented by DOD 4160.21-M,
Defense Materiel Disposition Manual, Chapter 13, Reclamation. Air Force Manual (AFMAN)
23-110, USAF Supply Manual, Volume 6, Chapter 6, Reclamation specifies basic Air Force (AF)
responsibilities for reclamation of USAF property.

AFI 16-402, Aerospace Vehicle Programming, Assignment, Distribution, Accounting and
Termination, documents assignment of inactive aircraft storage purpose identifier codes and the
requirement for weapons system migration plans. These publications provide the framework for
managing inactive aircraft while migration into reclamation status.

This instruction provides guidance for reclamation of AF aircraft and aircraft engines stored at
the 309 Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) at Davis-Monthan AFB,
AZ. It also provides guidance for engine and end item reclamation at the Air Logistics Centers
(ALCs) and for non-programmed reclamation of aircraft and missiles accomplished at sites other
than AMARG. This publication applies to the Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve
Command (AFRC) and their units. Ensure all records created as a result of processes prescribed
in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records,

                                            Chapter 1

                          GENERAL OVERVIEW/BACKGROUND

1.1. DoD Reclamation Policy: Reclamation may be used whenever it can provide the fastest
method of satisfying a critical requirement or when there is no other known Source of Supply
(SOS). Frequently, AMARG may be the only source for parts no longer commercially
procurable. The Reclamation program goal is to reclaim the right parts, in the right quantities at
the right time. For more information reference DOD 4140.1-R Supply Chain Materiel
Management Regulation.
1.2. Management and Utilization of Excess Aircraft: Effective management and utilization
of AF excess aircraft are collaborative efforts requiring communication and coordination among
many entities. From the time an aircraft is declared excess to AF operational requirements until
it is ultimately authorized for disposal, HQ USAF/A8P/A3/A4L, SAF/IAR, 401SCMS/GUMC,
System Program Managers/System Sustainment Managers (SPMs/SSMs), Item Managers (IMs)
and AMARG all have a role in either making or influencing decisions relating to reclamation of
aircraft, aircraft engines, and end items.
1.3. AMARG Storage Site: AMARG is the primary storage location for DoD aircraft excess to
current operational mission requirements. AMARG performs preservation, storage, aircraft
flight withdrawal, aircraft overland shipment, reclamation, disposal functions, and overflow
depot maintenance for the AF in accordance with DoD and AF instructions, directives, and
technical guidance.
1.4. Migration Plans for Excess Aircraft:
     1.4.1. AFI 16-402 directs SPMs/SSMs to develop annual aircraft Migration Plans for aircraft
     currently stored at AMARG or projected for induction into AMARG storage during the
     Future Years Defense Program (FYDP). Annual migration plans document the results of
     each SPM’s/SSM’s complete review of aircraft projected for retirement and AMARG stored
     aircraft. A comprehensive plan ensures aircraft are assigned to the most appropriate purpose
     identifier codes (and storage project code) referenced in Attachment 4 and are migrated
     through programmed reclamation status in a timely manner. A typical storage progression
     path is outlined in attachment 5 for reference and starting points are subject to change based
     on each particular situation. Effective migration planning provides an orderly and timely
     progression from the most restrictive purpose identifier codes (XS, XT, and XV) to the least
     restrictive purpose identifier codes (XX, XD). Consideration of spare parts requirements
     must always be a factor in determining proper purpose identifier codes. At a point in time,
     aircraft become more valuable as a source for parts reclamation than for retention as whole
     aircraft no longer suitable for flight.
     1.4.2. Effective aircraft migration planning is critical to the success of the AF Reclamation
     Program. AFI 16-402 requires SPMs/SSMs, on an annual basis, develop Migration Plans to
     review their total AMARG aircraft inventory and document the results of the review in a
     weapons system Migration Plan. This comprehensive review verifies aircraft are assigned to
     the purpose identifier codes which most accurately reflect aircraft status. Refer to AFI 16-
     402, for Migration Plan policies and procedures. Migration Plan reclamation workload
     projections assist AMARG in forecasting requirements for funding, manpower, special tools
AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                   9


   and equipment necessary to accomplish programmed reclamation workload in a timely
   manner. They also allow for timely and orderly development of the required programmed
   reclamation save lists.
1.5. Flight Potential for AMARG Stored Aircraft: Many aircraft stored at AMARG have
future flight potential to satisfy a wide variety of DoD or Foreign Military Sales (FMS)
requirements. In order to maintain integrity and airworthiness of these aircraft, parts removals
must be restricted to a minimum. These aircraft are assigned to purpose identifier codes XS or
XT by HQ USAF/A8PB (Refer to Chapter 3). In accordance with AFI 16-402, documented
approval from HQ USAF/A4LY must be received by the appropriate SPM/SSM before
authorizing AMARG to accomplish removal of any part from inviolate aircraft.
1.6. Reclamation Potential for AMARG Stored Aircraft: Stored aircraft having no future
flight potential offer a significant opportunity to provide parts and engines to support AF
operational missions, replenish supply inventories and generate cost avoidance benefits.
Circumstances may prompt the SPM/SSM to retain aircraft in purpose identifier code XV;
however, programmed reclamation purpose identifier code XX is appropriate for these aircraft at
the earliest possible time. Aircraft in these categories are available as a source for priority
reclamation when parts are not available from wholesale stocks.
1.7. Funding for AMARG Storage and Reclamation:
   1.7.1. Costs associated with the initial induction, in storage maintenance, and disposal of
   aircraft, missiles, Other Major End Items (OMEI), special tooling/special test equipment are
   funded in accordance with AFMAN 65-604, Appropriation Symbols and Budget Codes
   (Fiscal Year 2011). Requirements for those items are identified as directed by Consolidated
   Sustainment Activities Group-Maintenance (CSAG-M) requirements call. In addition,
   DPEM dollars also fund costs associated with the disposal process and other authorized
   miscellaneous projects. In preparation for the Program Objective Memorandum (POM)
   cycle, requirements for various processes are defined as specified by the DPEM requirements
   data call in the June to September period. Requirements include the current fiscal year (FY)
   plus the FYDP. Projections are based on workload information developed by SPMs/SSMs
   and AMARG and consider historical data.
   1.7.2. Consolidated Sustainment Activities Group-Supply (CSAG-S) funds are provided by
   AFGLSC/FMR at Hill, Robins, and Tinker AFB to fund AF reclamation of budget code “8”
   program workload. O&M or other appropriated funds are used for all other reclamation
   activities to include storage of aircraft, engines and other end items and reclamation of non
   budget code “8” workload at AMARG. Priority reclamation funding is provided to AMARG
   based on past historical activity.
1.8. Reclamation Benefits:
   1.8.1. Parts generated from programmed and non-programmed reclamation replenish supply
   stocks and contribute to improving support to operational units. In addition, reclamation is
   especially beneficial when lengthy procurement lead times, repair delays or diminishing
   commercial sources jeopardize the supply system’s ability to satisfy customer requirements.
   1.8.2. Generally, individual priority reclamation actions are not as cost effective as the
   programmed reclamation of a group of aircraft. However, the opportunity to satisfy critical
   mission requirements must be the primary consideration and justification for requesting
 10                                                        AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012


   priority reclamation support from AMARG. Frequently, AMARG may be the only source
   for critical parts.
1.9. Potential Yield from Reclamation: The potential yield from reclamation activity is very
unpredictable. Many factors impact the likelihood of successfully reclaiming items. The longer
an aircraft remains in storage, the less likely its reclaimed parts will be in serviceable or
repairable condition. Over time, exposure to weather elements causes parts to deteriorate and
some are no longer useful. Obsolescence also becomes a factor. For example, if aircraft have
been held in XV storage status for an extended period and have been subjected to extensive
priority removal activity, the projected yield from programmed reclamation will be considerably
less than if aircraft were relatively new AMARG arrivals and had not been subjected to priority
parts reclamation. Effective migration planning makes aircraft available to the programmed
reclamation process at the earliest possible time and increases the likelihood of yielding
serviceable or repairable parts.
1.10. Reclamation and the Logistics Supply Chain: The reclamation process is an extremely
valuable link in the AF supply chain; however, its unique circumstances must always be
considered when forecasting parts yields or cost avoidance benefits that may not materialize.
Because of risks associated with this unpredictability, IMs must not cancel or defer procurement
actions or load due-ins based on the possibility of potential assets being generated from
programmed reclamation. It is also not advisable to make budget related decisions by relying on
forecasted reclamation savings - failure to generate the forecasted savings may have potentially
negative effects on funding decisions. The true benefits of reclamation cannot be determined
until a project or priority reclamation request is completed, inspection performed, and assets are
returned to AF inventory in serviceable condition.

   AFGLSC Reclamation Program Control Officers (RPCOs), HQ AFMC/A4US Aerospace
   Vehicle Distribution Office (AF AVDO) and AMARG/OBW in order to make informed
   decisions relating to all aspects of the reclamation program. Focus areas include aircraft
   purpose identifier code assignment, save list development, programmed reclamation
   execution, priority reclamation activity, aircraft disposal decisions, and other related program
   activity.
   2.4.2. Initiate and track accomplishment of programmed and non-programmed reclamation
   save list projects and provides clarification and technical guidance.
2.5. AFGLSC Reclamation Program Control Officer (RPCO) will:
   2.5.1. Coordinate actions required to develop programmed and non-programmed save lists
   for aircraft and aircraft engines.
   2.5.2. Manage the reclamation save list activity for their ALC. Each AFGLSC RPCO is
   notified when the 401SCMS/GUMC RPM initiates a new programmed or non-programmed
   reclamation save list project using D035G Reutilization and Disposition System (RDS).
   Each AFGLSC RPCO works closely with other RPCOs, SPM/SSM/Item Manager
   (IM)/Engine Item Manager (EIM) personnel, 401SCMS/GUMC, and AMARG to ensure
   timely completion. Every save list project will have a lead RPCO assigned. This
   responsibility is normally assigned to AFGLSC RPCO assigned at the same ALC as the
   SPM/SSM.
2.6. AFGLSC Squadron/Product Directorate (PD) Monitor will: Serve as liaison between
AFGLSC RPCOs and division IMs. Each monitor tracks save list development progress and
informs their AFGLSC RPCO of delays or difficulties in meeting established suspense dates.
2.7. System Program Manager/System Sustainment Manager (SPM/SSM) will:
   2.7.1. Manage AMARG stored assets utilizing information received from many sources,
   including HQ USAF/A8P and A4L, SAF/IAR, 401SCMS/GUMC and AMARG.
 12                                                         AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012


   2.7.2. Develop an annual aircraft Migration Plan. Reference AFI 16-402. The plan either
   validates existing storage projects and purpose identifier codes or identifies aircraft that must
   be reassigned to more appropriate codes or authorized for disposal. Upon completion of the
   annual review, SPMs/SSMs requests HQ USAF/A8PB approve and document storage project
   and purpose identifier code changes on AF Forms 913, as required. A copy of approved
   Migration Plans must be furnished to applicable Engine Item Managers (EIMs) for
   information and planning purposes.
   2.7.3. Approve and submit AMARG priority reclamation actions to support high priority
   backorders, removals driven by requirements system computations identifying items required
   for stockage in the wholesale supply system, and appropriately authorized special projects.
   Priority reclamation process is outlined in chapter 5. If the part must be obtained from an
   aircraft in inviolate storage status, SPM/SSM must request approval from HQ USAF/A4LY.
   Identify potential donor aircraft before passing the requisition to AMARG for action.
   2.7.4. Identify Weapon System Reclamation Officer (WSROs) who will act as the priority
   reclamation focal points within each SPM/SSM organization. WSROs should work closely
   with ES and IMs to ensure approved priority requirements passed to AMARG which
   contains all information necessary to accomplish parts removals in a timely manner. Each
   WSRO also monitors the status of programmed and non-programmed reclamation actions
   taken on behalf of their weapons system and works with their respective AFGLSC RPCO to
   assist in timely development of reclamation save lists and maximize utilization of reclaimed
   materiel.
2.8. Engine Item Managers (EIMs) will:
   2.8.1. Manage AMARG stored engines similar to aircraft processes. EIMs are assigned to
   engine program offices and the final approving authority for engine reclamation.
   2.8.2. Maintain visibility of engine resources stored at AMARG. Although a formal
   migration plan is not specified for engines, it is important for EIMs review and validates the
   need to retain stored engines. AMARG engine inventory is included in AF Comprehensive
   Engine Management System Database.
   2.8.3. Consider priority reclamation potential available from AMARG engine resources
   when wholesale stocks are not sufficient to support critical requirements. If a critical part
   can only be obtained from an engine installed on or obligated to an aircraft in inviolate status,
   the EIM must request the SPM/SSM to obtain removal approval from HQ USAF/A4LY.
   2.8.4. Authorize either disposal or approved secondary uses if reclamation is not a viable
   option. AMARG engines no longer useable as complete engines should be utilized for
   priority/save list reclamation supported parts.
   2.8.5. Ensure they receive copies of all annual SPM/SSM Migration Plans relating to the
   engines they manage. Migration Plans forecast future AMARG inductions and changes in
   aircraft storage categories that may make additional engines available to EMs.
2.9. Item Managers will:
   2.9.1. Considered reclamation as a potential source to satisfy critical requirements or
   replenish wholesale inventories to prevent out-of-stock conditions on various types of aircraft
   stored at AMARG.
AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                     13


  2.9.2. Consider AMARG reclamation potential before generating purchase requests (PR).
  When wholesale inventory stocks cannot satisfy requirements, IMs should review
  requirements system data and coordinate with equipment specialists (ES) to consider priority
  reclamation support from AMARG stored aircraft.
  2.9.3. Determine if there are stored aircraft that might yield the required parts by reviewing
  AMARG RCS: LOG-MM (M) 7148, Aircraft and Missile Activity and Status Report via the
  AF Portal. If applicable donor aircraft are available for parts removal, IMs must initiate an
  AMARG Form 44, at https://absweb.dm.af.mil/ for approval by the applicable SPM/SSM
  Weapon System Reclamation Officer. The SPM/SSM WSRO then identifies potential donor
  aircraft and submits the removal request to AMARG to determine if useable parts can be
  supplied in lieu of generating a PR (Refer to Chapter 6).
  2.9.4. Process save list candidate items assigned to their RDS workbaskets for programmed
  and non-programmed reclamation. IMs must review requirements data for the potential save
  list candidates and coordinate with the equipment specialist (ES) to determine if candidate
  items meet criteria for save list inclusion.
  2.9.5. Along with ESs and supervisors, respond to RDS workbasket items within time
  periods established in RDS. Items not worked in a timely manner are identified by RDS as
  being “overaged”. Supervision at each respective level must take action to ensure save list
  actions are proactively worked to prevent save list candidates from becoming overaged.
  Personnel responsible for save list actions must be coordinated with AFGLSC RPCO if they
  anticipate delays.
2.10. AMARG will:
  2.10.1. Have custodial responsibility for assets stored at their facility. Take direction from
  HQ USAF, HQ AFMC, 401SCMS/GUMC, weapon system SPM/SSM or other authorized
  activities for processing aircraft into storage, maintenance while in storage, flight preparation
  or overland shipment, reclamation, and disposal. AMARG makes recommendations to
  customers and provides a wide range of expertise and data to aid in the management of stored
  aircraft and aircraft engines.
  2.10.2. Preserves and maintain stored aircraft and aircraft engines as directed by SPM/SSM
  and as specified in AF Technical Order 1-1-686, Desert Storage, Preservation and Process
  Manual for Aircraft, Aircraft Engines, and Aircraft Auxiliary Power Unit Engines. AMARG
  may also be requested to store and maintain other USAF assets (tooling/test equipment…).
  2.10.3. Reclaim parts to support both priority reclamation requisitions and programmed
  reclamation save list project requirements. Reclamation actions must be initiated by the
  appropriate SOS and passed to the SPM/SSM for submission to AMARG. AMARG does
  not disassemble aircraft and warehouse parts in anticipation of future requirements.
  2.10.4. Receive Aerospace Vehicle Assignment Directives from the AF AVDO.
  Information in the directives is based on AF Form 913 issued by HQ USAF/A8PB. AMARG
  establishes internal data records assigning the arriving aircraft/aircraft engines to the project
  code specified on the assignment directive. Subsequent code changes are received and
  processed in the same manner. AMARG accomplishes the specified work directed by the
  customer.

  2.10.5. Screens reclamation status aircraft through General Services Administration (GSA)
  for possible transfer to authorized recipients (e.g. other federal agencies) and once released
  processes them for disposal.
  2.10.6. Perform at a minimum two semi-annual HQ AFMC Stock Number User Directory
  (SNUD) reconciliations with the FN2373 storage account to ensure SNUD data is kept up to
  date.
  2.10.7. Monitor programmed reclamation save list funding program execution closely and
  coordinates with appropriate stakeholders as required to prevent work stoppages.

                                           Chapter 4

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

4.1. Aircraft Authorized for Reclamation Activity: When aircraft migrate from storage
purpose codes XS or XT to XV, they become a source for SPM/SSM approved priority
reclamation parts required to support active aircraft. When aircraft are assigned to a
programmed reclamation project, they become a source for both priority reclamation to support
immediate operating requirements and for programmed reclamation of parts required to replenish
wholesale stocks. This chapter provides general information for the various reclamation
categories – programmed, priority, non-programmed and engine. Refer to the applicable
chapters for more detailed information related to a specific category.
4.2. Reclamation Consideration Prior to Initiating Purchase Requests (PRs):
   4.2.1. Each IM organization must develop a process to prompt IMs to consider an NSN’s
   reclamation potential prior to executing PRs. A review of the monthly AMARG aircraft
   inventory listed in the RCS: LOG (MM) M-7148 report shows if there are applicable Mission
   Design Series (MDS) aircraft that may be a source of required parts.
   4.2.2. If there are no suitable donor aircraft, an IM must document reclamation was
   considered before proceeding with PR.
   4.2.3. If there are applicable stored aircraft, IM must determine if there is a current
   programmed reclamation project under development or in work. If so, the IM must
   determine if it is feasible to add the required part to the existing save list. If the project is
   nearing completion and adding to a save list is not an option, the IM must submit a priority
   reclamation request to AMARG and attempt to obtain the parts. Priority backorders can be
   satisfied with Category A priority reclamation requests and assets required to replenish
   wholesale stocks may be satisfied with Category B priority reclamation requests (refer to
   Chapter 6).
   4.2.4. IMs need to ensure long-term reliance on reclaimed parts does not result in loss of
   commercial sources that jeopardize future support. In considering reclamation potential, IMs
   must strike a balance between utilizing reclaimed parts and procuring new parts.
4.3. Determining Parts Availability from AMARG Aircraft: AMARG cannot respond to
informal customer requests for availability of specific aircraft or engine parts. In order to
determine parts availability from AMARG aircraft, the SOS must generate an AMARG Form 44
request to the SPM/SSM for submission of a priority removal request or, if the timing is right,
add the required part to an applicable programmed reclamation save list and allow AMARG to
determine if the part can be supplied in an acceptable condition. There is no listing of parts
potentially available from AMARG stored aircraft. AMARG does not remove and warehouse
parts in anticipation of potential future requirements.
4.4. Determination of Reclamation Requirements: Reclamation removals are driven by
requirements system computations identifying items required for stockage in the wholesale
supply system, high priority backorders or to satisfy appropriately authorized special projects.
4.5. Economic Considerations for Reclamation: A unit cost of at least $250.00 is considered
the minimum dollar value when justifying reclamation of a programmed, non-programmed,
AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                    17


engine or end item asset. This cost threshold is not an absolute value; it considers the average
costs related to removing, cleaning, inspecting, packaging and shipping a reclaimed part. If there
are constraints related to commercially procuring a part or other valid considerations, the dollar
value of the required part is irrelevant and reclamation is an appropriate source of support.
4.6. Authorization to Submit Priority Reclamation Requests: All requirements for parts
reclamation from AF managed aircraft, engines, or other end items must be submitted through
the SOS for review and initiation of an AMARG Form 44. The SOS then forwards the AMARG
Form 44 to the SPM/SSM/EIM WSRO for approval, aircraft selection, and submission to
AMARG. Base level customers, support organizations, contractors, foreign governments, etc.
are not authorized to go directly to AMARG for parts support from AF stored assets.
4.7. Authorization for Removals from Inviolate Aircraft:
   4.7.1. If a part the customer requires is available only from XS or XT purpose identifier
   coded AMARG aircraft, the SPM/SSM must provide justification and obtain written
   approval from HQ USAF/A4LY prior to submitting the AMARG Form 44 directing
   AMARG to remove the item. The SPM/SSM must furnish AMARG a copy of the HQ
   USAF/A4LY authorization to support removals from inviolate aircraft. AMARG must retain
   a copy of removal authorizations in applicable aircraft records.
   4.7.2. HQ USAF/A4LY and the SPM/SSM must arrange to secure replacements through the
   applicable SOS for parts authorized for removal from inviolate aircraft. If replacement is
   deemed necessary, the SPM/SSM/EIM and IM must coordinate acquisition of the
   replacement part and direct shipment to AMARG. AMARG does not requisition
   replacement parts for inviolate aircraft. The SPM/SSM must also coordinate with AMARG
   to determine if the replacement item must be reinstalled. When the replacement part is
   shipped to AMARG, it is processed as a receipt into the AMARG storage account and
   obligated to the appropriate inviolate aircraft.
   4.7.3. When authorizing removals from AMARG inviolate aircraft, approving officials must
   consider the type of part requested and the impact its removal would have on AMARG’s
   ability to accomplish future re-preservation cycle maintenance tasks. Jeopardizing re-
   preservation could mean degrading the utility of an aircraft and limiting its potential to
   satisfy a future flying requirement. The immediate need for the part must be weighed against
   maintaining the integrity of the inviolate aircraft.
4.8. Technical Information Required Accomplishing Reclamation:
   4.8.1. The success of the reclamation process is dependent on the accuracy and content of
   the technical information furnished by the customer. Reclamation requests must include
   applicable aircraft or engine illustrated parts breakdown (IPB) technical order references,
   inspection criteria and any additional information that might help the reclaiming activity
   provide required parts in desired materiel condition codes. The IPB reference is critical to
   the reclaiming activity’s ability to locate the requested part on the aircraft or engine. In
   addition to the IPB reference, it may be helpful to provide an applicable commodity technical
   order reference. If there is absolutely no published technical information, the requestor must
   furnish drawings, specification sheets, or other information to enable AMARG to locate the
   part on the aircraft.
 18                                                        AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012


   4.8.2. AMARG has extensive technical data resources, but they do not have complete
   technical files on every weapons system/engine. It may be necessary for AMARG to request
   copies of pertinent technical information from SPM/SSM organizations prior to reclamation
   of the requested parts.
   4.8.3. AMARG retains the technical information developed to facilitate the removal of parts
   from stored aircraft in the Reclamation Removal Package Library. Retention of the technical
   work packages is required in accordance with T.O. 00-5-2, paragraph 3.7.9. Availability of
   previously developed work packages saves the effort to research the same information each
   time a repeat part is requested.
   4.8.4. Quantity per aircraft (QPA) is the correct term to utilize on all AMARG reclamation
   actions and non-programmed reclamation performed at other sites. For aircraft reclamation
   purposes, the QPA must always be the total quantity of a specific part installed on the whole
   aircraft, not the “quantity per assembly” or “quantity per article.” The distinction between
   the terms is important. All AMARG Forms 44, AFMC Forms 110, Reclamation Requisition
   and AFMC Forms 111, Reclamation Save List must compute the aircraft QPA figure to
   include total quantity of a specific NSN installed on a single aircraft – QPA.
4.9. Requirements for Tools and Equipment: AMARG does not have a full complement of
tools and equipment unique to all stored weapons systems and engines. They may require
SPM/SSM/EIM/IM/ES assistance in identifying and sourcing necessary tools and equipment to
facilitate parts removal processes. It is sometimes necessary for AMARG to arrange for
maintenance-to-maintenance loan of specialized equipment required to accomplish removals.
4.10. The AMARG Asset Visibility System:
   4.10.1. AMARG maintains aircraft asset visibility information in the AMARG Business
   System’s C03 negative inventory report. Each individual aircraft has its own record of parts
   previously removed. This negative inventory record accounts for parts known to be missing
   from the aircraft at the time of arrival at AMARG and for all subsequent parts removals. C03
   reports can be accessed through the AMARG Form 44 website at;
   https://absweb.dm.af.mil/. The AMARG Form 44 web site contains information that is
   useful when evaluating the status and condition of specific aircraft.
   4.10.2. Parts removal records are established at the time aircraft arrive for storage. Each
   aircraft is examined, records reviewed, and parts noted as missing are recorded in AMARG
   C03 data records. Subsequent parts removals are also recorded and become part of the
   negative inventory for each aircraft.
   4.10.3. If a part is not recorded as previously removed, the assumption is the part is available
   on the aircraft. However, a number of variables impact C03 data integrity. Over time,
   circumstances contribute to degrading negative inventory accuracy.
      4.10.3.1. Components not required for safety-of-flight are sometimes removed without
      authorization or documentation prior to aircraft delivery to AMARG.             Some
      modifications or component updates may not have been properly recorded in the aircraft
      records.
      4.10.3.2. Next-higher assemblies, over-assembled parts or large structural assemblies
      may have been removed and identified in the AMARG C03 report as the removal of one
AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                    19


      item. The individual components that were part of a much larger assembly may not have
      been recorded.
   4.10.4. The only way to be certain if a required item is available is to submit the removal
   request to AMARG so they can physically check aircraft/end items for parts availability. If
   the part is available, the priority removal is processed and the customer’s order is filled. If
   AMARG determines the part is unavailable, AMARG will update the F44 database. The
   SPM/SSM or EIM can then confer with the IM and attempt to obtain support elsewhere.
4.11. Supply Condition Codes for Reclaimed Materiel:
   4.11.1. Reclamation requisitions should request materiel in the required supply condition
   codes and all reclaiming activities should attempt to provide the parts in the condition codes
   requested. If the reclaiming activity cannot provide parts in the desired condition, the IM
   must be informed and determine if a lesser condition is acceptable. To prevent unnecessary
   delays and further mission degradation, when parts are shipped directly from AMARG to
   base level customers it must be in the best possible condition to satisfy critical shortages.
   4.11.2. Save lists actions for programmed, non-programmed, engine, and end item
   reclamation must identify the supply condition codes required. If the computation includes
   an adequate supply of reparable carcasses, the IM should request serviceable, “A” condition
   materiel. Reclaiming “R” condition assets which prove to be unserviceable will result in
   increasing the amount of reparable carcasses.
   4.11.3. AMARG reclaimed parts are assigned supply condition codes A, F or R.
   Reclamation performed at sites other than AMARG is assigned supply condition code A, F,
   R or K. Reference DOD 4000.25-2-M, Military Standard Transaction Reporting and
   Accounting Procedures (MILSTRAP), Appendix 2.5 for supply condition code definitions
   4.11.4. Serviceable, supply condition code A, reclaimed parts are most generally preferred.
   However, there are requirement computations identifying the need for unserviceable, supply
   condition code F assets. IMs may require reparable carcasses to support repair programs,
   need assets suitable for modification/upgrade, or be willing to accept unserviceable, supply
   condition code F assets if there is absolutely no other source to obtain the parts. Supply
   condition code R, suspended reclaimed parts awaiting condition determination, may be
   requested from AMARG if the reclaiming activity does not have capability to determine the
   actual condition.
   4.11.5. AMARG Form 44 requisitions submitted to AMARG should reflect the customer’s
   true supply condition code requirement. If the requirement is for condition code A, AMARG
   must make every reasonable effort to inspect and test the reclaimed parts to verify the true
   materiel condition. If AMARG does not have the maintenance skills or test equipment to
   determine the true condition, they must request the SPM/IM verify the customer is willing to
   accept the part in condition code R.
   4.11.6. There are circumstances when it may be necessary to ship condition code R priority
   reclamation parts from AMARG to a depot or to a contractor facility for condition
   inspection/repair prior to sending the parts to base level customers. IM generated AMARG
   Form 44, submitted through the SPM/SSM WSRO function, must provide AMARG with
   ship to/mark for information for the shipping document in order to facilitate tracking the part
 20                                                       AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012


   through depot inspection/repair process and ensure it is shipped to the requisitioner upon
   completion.
   4.11.7. When the reclaiming activity does not have capability (skills, manpower or test
   equipment) to inspect and verify the materiel condition of reclaimed parts, supply condition
   code R (suspended stock) is assigned. Generation of parts in R condition should occur only
   when the reclaiming activity cannot determine the true materiel condition or the customer
   requests “R” condition, not for expediency in satisfying removal requests. The goal is to
   provide the customer with condition code A parts and minimize the use of condition code R.
4.12. AMARG Capability to Inspect and Determine Materiel Condition:
   4.12.1. Programmed and priority reclamation customers are best served when AMARG has
   the ability to check and test reclaimed parts and generate serviceable materiel.
   4.12.2. AMARG must periodically review its maintenance functional check and test
   capability database. This database is maintained by NSN and identifies parts AMARG can
   functionally check to determine actual supply condition codes. This information can be a
   valuable resource to SPM/SSM, IM and ES personnel. Whenever practical and economically
   feasible, AMARG should consider acquiring additional functional check capabilities, test
   equipment and maintenance skills necessary to increase the ability to perform condition
   verification. AMARG must contact automated test system or support equipment item
   managers to ensure the most up to date equipment is ordered or to assist in answering support
   questions.
   4.12.3. AMARG has the capability to perform inspections for supply condition code
   determination on a wide range of parts such as structural fittings, panels, etc. The following
   methods are examples of this type of inspection: x-ray, visual, common measuring devices,
   liquid penetrants and magnetic particle inspections, etc.
4.13. Reclamation of DLA Managed Parts:
   4.13.1. DLA participation in reclamation is limited to AMARG priority reclamation
   requisitions. AMARG Forms 44 are initiated by the DLA supply representative and routed
   through the applicable aircraft SPM/SSM or EIM for AMARG removal authority and donor
   aircraft selection. DLA provides funds to AMARG for the removal, inspection, packaging,
   and shipment of DLA managed NSNs. See chapter six for additional details on priority
   reclamation.
4.14. Signal Codes for Shipment of Reclaimed Parts:
   4.14.1. Signal codes A and D are utilized in shipping documents for reclaimed materiel.
   Exceptions must be reviewed and authorized by the IM.
   4.14.2. Programmed reclamation assets shipped to the Inventory Control Point (ICP) are
   received and capitalized as inventory adjustments to supply inventory. The IM requesting
   parts via the save list is considered the requisitioner and no billing or credit is required.
   Signal code D applies.
   4.14.3. Priority reclamation assets are shipped as redistribution orders passed to AMARG
   from the SPMs/SSMs or EMs, in response to a customer’s MILSTRIP requisition. Signal
   code A applies.
AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                     21


4.15. Supply Receiving Procedures for AMARG Priority Reclamation Shipments: Supply
receiving activities process receipts from AMARG priority reclamation shipments in the same
way as stocks received from the wholesale supply system. Reclaimed assets do not have a
separate pricing structure – they have the same unit prices as wholesale supply system assets.
Free issue is not authorized.
4.16. Considerations for Reclaiming an Aircraft More than Once: Unusual circumstances
may require that aircraft previously reclaimed and currently held in RIT status be reclaimed a
second time. If the initial save list was relatively small and the requirements computation status
has changed significantly, SPM/SSM personnel may elect to re-reclaim the aircraft by applying a
new, current save list. SPM/SSM must request assignment of a new reclamation project number
and a new save list from the RPM using instructions listed in Section 6. Prior to requesting a
new save list, SPM/SSM should request AMARG C03 reports for each aircraft in question to
determine the extent of prior reclamation activity and assess potential benefits which might result
from a second reclamation effort.
4.17. Protection/Preservation of Reclamation Status Aircraft:
   4.17.1. AMARG reclamation status aircraft (preservation level 4000) are not normally
   resealed after programmed reclamation removal actions are completed. Upon completion of
   programmed reclamation, AMARG must process aircraft in accordance with applicable AF
   Form 913 instructions.
   4.17.2. If SPM/SSM decides to retain the aircraft in RIT status to support future parts
   requirements, the SPM/SSM disposition response to AMARG must request aircraft be
   resealed, as necessary, to ensure protection from the elements during the RIT storage period.
   SPM/SSM must assess the physical condition of newly assigned RIT aircraft to determine
   what preservation actions must be accomplished. Minimal resource protection ensures
   exposure to weather elements does not jeopardize the likelihood of reclaiming more useable
   parts in the future. AMARG must develop procedures to ensure any additional customer
   requirements for protection of RIT status aircraft are reviewed and then take necessary
   action. If the SPM/SSM directs retention of aircraft in RIT status for access to structural
   parts and needs no future preservation or reseals, no further action is necessary.
   4.17.3. Costs related to the initial reseal upon assignment to RIT status are legitimately
   charged to CSAG-S funds. Reseal costs associated with accessing priority reclamation parts
   are funded as a customer CSAG-S cost associated with the removal of the part.
   4.17.4. If SPMs/SSMs request the additional resource protection measures, they must
   coordinate the desired level of protection and associated costs with AMARG/OBW. CSAG-
   S funds are not authorized for additional resource protection action.
4.18. Reclamation Actions That Immobilize the Donor Aircraft: Reclamation of parts that
will immobilize the donor aircraft (struts, wheels, landing gear, etc.) must be coordinated with
AMARG. It may be necessary to provide AMARG with condemned parts suitable for AMARG
use to facilitate movement of the aircraft later. It is a joint responsibility of the SPM/SSM/IM to
arrange for shipment of the condemned replacement parts to AMARG. If condemned parts are
not available, it may be necessary for AMARG to relocate the aircraft to a more appropriate
storage location and then build storage modules to support the aircraft after the required parts
have been removed. Costs related to installation of condemned parts or the construction of
 22                                                         AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012


storage modules are considered a cost related to the reclamation of the required parts and must be
charged accordingly.
4.19. Reclamation of Component Parts: Component parts (such as circuit cards, diodes, etc.)
of a next higher assembly should be considered for reclamation only when there is no
requirement for the higher assembly/end item. These type parts, commonly referred to as shop
replaceable units (SRUs) should not normally be included in a programmed reclamation save list.
The intent is to give first preference to utilizing the next higher assembly (sometimes referred to
as line replacement unit) instead of subjecting it to component removals. However,
circumstances may warrant removal of internal components.
4.20. Parts Removed during AMARG Storage Induction:
   4.20.1. Certain categories of materiel are removed from aircraft during processing into
   storage at AMARG (Refer to Chapter 10). Parts are turned in to the AMARG storage
   account.
   4.20.2. Munitions are turned into Combat Ammunition System (CAS) for immediate
   reporting and disposition processing. Munitions are not part of the reclamation activity and
   must never be included in programmed reclamation save lists.
   4.20.3. Classified parts removed from stored aircraft (other than inviolate status) are
   normally reported to the IM for immediate disposition. In consideration of the limited
   availability of classified vault storage space at AMARG, the AMARG Business Office
   should request disposition instructions prior to the arrival of excess aircraft parts. The
   advance disposition authority permits immediate shipment of the classified parts. Classified
   parts obligated to inviolate status aircraft may be stored at AMARG as long as adequate vault
   storage space is available.
   4.20.4. Miscellaneous parts subject to deterioration or pilferage and hazardous parts are also
   turned in to AMARG storage account for retention or disposition, as appropriate.
   4.20.5. The aircraft SPM/SSM may recommend parts critical to long-term sustainability of
   the weapons system and judged likely to deteriorate due to high temperatures and other
   environmental conditions be removed from the aircraft and placed into AMARG’s storage
   account, obligated to the aircraft from which they were removed. Because of AMARG
   warehouse storage space limitations, these procedures should be utilized on a limited basis.
   Items approved for storage must be evaluated and approved by the SPM/SSM/IM and
   coordinated with AMARG on a semi-annual basis. Warehouse storage increases the
   possibility critical parts can be utilized to satisfy future requirements and protect against
   diminishing sources of supply. Parts held in AMARG storage (obligated to STV or STX/D
   projects) are available to support priority reclamation requirements, at SPM/SSM direction.
4.21. Reclamation of Over-assembled Parts: Circumstances may justify the reclamation of
over-assembled parts. This situation occurs when it is necessary to remove the requested part
and additional attached parts. If removing the attached parts would damage the requested item or
cause a recipient extensive maintenance work, IMs can authorize removal of the over-assembled
part. Approval for over-assembled parts must be justified by a valid maintenance concern, not
simply for expediency or the convenience of the reclaiming activity.
AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                    23


4.22. Save List Validity:
   4.22.1. Save lists are valid for one year from date of issue by RPM. It is very important for
   all participants to complete their portion of the process within allotted time frames to ensure
   completion of all save list activity on a specific project within the one-year time frame.
   4.22.2. A save list is, in effect, a snapshot at a point in time and uses requirements data
   current at the time the save list was prepared. As requirements change over time and the
   computation gets further out of date, there is a growing risk of over-reclaiming some items
   and under-reclaiming others.
   4.22.3. IMs must consider adding items to a current save list if requirements have increased
   and reclamation offers potential relief. This same consideration must be made for deleting
   items if requirements have decreased and continuing reclamation would generate excess
   assets. If the save list has progressed to “in work” status at AMARG, it may be better to
   submit the “add on” requirement as a Category “B” AMARG Form 44 priority request
   instead of adding it to the save list in progress. IMs should confer with AMARG planning
   and scheduling personnel to determine the best course of action.
4.23. Pre-planning to Support Projected Reclamation Projects: SPMs/SSMs must consider
the benefits of reclamation when developing strategies for long-term sustainment of active
weapons systems. Pre-planning for the eventual deactivation of aircraft and subsequent parts
reclamation can pay major dividends. Often, shortages of peculiar tools and equipment hamper
AMARG’s ability to effectively and promptly execute the SPM’s/SSM’s requested reclamation
removals. Establishing a preliminary dialogue between AMARG/OBW and the appropriate
weapons system points of contact provides valuable lead time needed to identify and resolve
potential constraints related to skills, training, facilities, equipment, tools, technical data
availability, etc. This is especially important if the weapon system will be a new MDS in the
AMARG inventory.
4.24. Reclamation Requisition Forms: AFMC Form 110, Reclamation Requisition is used to
develop save lists for all programmed reclamation accomplished at AMARG. AFMC Form 111,
Reclamation Save List is utilized for non-programmed save list reclamation performed at sites
other than AMARG. The RPM may authorize use of an electronic spreadsheet in lieu of AFMC
Forms 110/111. AMARG Form 44s are utilized to request priority reclamation of parts from
AMARG stored aircraft and aircraft engines.
4.25. Unit Cost of Reclaimed Parts: Reclaimed parts have the same unit cost as like parts
issued from wholesale stocks. There is no reduced price assigned to reclaimed materiel. The
standard pricing structure applies.
4.26. Reclamation of Crash Damaged Aircraft: Crash damaged aircraft must not be
reclaimed without prior SPM/SSM authorization. Reference AFI 91-223, Aviation Safety
Investigations and Reports, Para 5.4.6.3, AFI 51-503, Aerospace Accident Investigations, Para
9.6, and to AFMAN 23-110, Volume 6, Chapter 9, Paragraph 9.5 for additional guidance.
4.27. Nuclear Weapons Related Materiel (NWRM): Stored aircraft at AMARG may contain
NWRM coded parts. AMARG must follow provisions of AFI 20-110, Nuclear Weapons Related
Materiel Management procedures to ensure proper removal actions are in compliance.
 24                                                        AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012

                            PROGRAMMED RECLAMATION

5.1. Programmed Reclamation: Programmed reclamation is the process used to accomplish
routine reclamation of aircraft located at AMARG.
5.2. Migration of Aircraft to Programmed Reclamation:
   5.2.1. SPM/SSM and IAW AFI 16-402 determine the appropriate time to migrate aircraft to
   programmed reclamation projects. If aircraft are already located at AMARG and assigned to
   purpose identifier codes XS, XT, or XV, HQ USAF/A8PB issues an AF Form 913,
   Aerospace Vehicle Project Action directing AF AVDO to transfer specific serial numbered
   aircraft to purpose identifier code XX or XD when requested by SPM/SSM. Aircraft with
   purpose identifier code XX will be transferred to Reclamation Insurance Type (RIT) storage
   projects upon completion of programmed reclamation. Aircraft with purpose identifier code
   XD will be authorized for disposal after programmed reclamation is completed.
   5.2.2. SPM/SSM personnel must factor in lead times and address resource requirements
   before initiating each save list request through RDS. Factors include, funding projections
   well enough in advance to ensure funding is available to execute each save list. For example,
   forecasted programmed reclamation save list requirements for an upcoming fiscal year will
   likely pass to FM officials 9-12 months ahead of time for planning purposes.
      5.2.2.1. SPM/SSM coordination with the AMARG Business Office is required to ensure
      availability of planning resources, validate assigned tail numbers, and available workload
      capacity. Synchronize all of these actions to ensure timely execution of reclamation save
      list projects.
      5.2.2.2. AFGLSC/FMR will lead the forecasting effort by providing funding projection
      timeline requirements to Aerospace Sustainment Directorates SPM/SSM organizations
      they support. SPM/SSM personnel must coordinate with their respective AFGLSC/FMR
      to ensure there is a mutual understanding of time-frame requirements. Note: Do not
      initiate save lists in RDS until funding and AMARG workload is planned to support the
      actual save list parts removal and shipment process.
      5.2.2.3. AMARG workload planning officials will provide SPM/SSM personnel with
      planning/costing factors based off of historical data from previous reclamation projects.
      Afterwards, SPM/SSM personnel will forecast future programmed reclamation save list
      requirements and forward the information to AFGLSC/FMR.
      5.2.2.4. SPM/SSM funding requirement projections must consider the number of aircraft
      identified on future projects. Prior priority reclamation activity must also be factored into
      estimating processes when developing funding projections to ensure they reflect current
      status of the aircraft. For example, aircraft that have been at AMARG for several years
      may have been reclaimed extensively already. While new aircraft arrivals will be
      relatively complete.
   5.2.3. SPM/SSM must contact the RPM to request a save list project number and save list
   initiation through RDS after all funding and AMARG workload pre-planning and
   coordination has been accomplished.
AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                    25


     5.2.4. SPM/SSM is responsible for coordinating with AMARG to determine when the
     programmed reclamation work can be accomplished when aircraft are assigned to STX and
     STD projects.
5.3. Assignment of Programmed Reclamation Project/Save List Numbers: The
programmed reclamation project/save list number assignment format is as follows:

Table 5.1. Programmed Reclamation Project/Save List Number Assignment
       Positions 1 &2                       Position 3                 Numeric Series
                                A = Attack (Ground Support)
RS                              B = Bomber                         300-399
(The prefix for every project   C = Cargo                          (Numbers are assigned
number is RS)                                                      sequentially)
                                E = Engine
                                F = Fighter
                                H = Helicopter
                                T = Trainer
Note: For example, an F-4 fighter programmed reclamation project number is
constructed as RSF-300. The next sequential number assignment, for a C-130 cargo
aircraft, would be RSC-301.
5.4. Save List Time Frame Requirements for Programmed Reclamation of AMARG
Aircraft:
     5.4.1. The following time frames apply to the save list development process at ALCs and to
     AMARG’s planning, removal, and shipment processes. Days referenced in this section are
     calendar days
     5.4.2. The requirement is to complete the total process for each programmed reclamation
     project within a 12 month period, starting from the time the save list is released by the RPM
     until all parts removal and shipment actions are completed at AMARG. The size of the save
     list and the number of aircraft on the reclamation project may permit completion in less time
     or may cause the project to exceed the 12 month time frame. The goal is to compress this
     time frame as much as possible and to capitalize on process improvements.
     5.4.3. Once RPM releases a save list project to RPCOs, a 30-day suspense is established by
     lead AFGLSC RPCOs for completing the RDS process and forwarding approved AFMC
     Form 110s to the applicable SPM/SSM for review and submission to AMARG.
        5.4.3.1. Lead RPCOs must ensure all save list candidate reviews are completed on time
        to include those managed at other sources of supply. This will require coordination with
        other RPCOs to ensure work is completed on time. In addition, item manager and
        equipment specialist supervisors must work with RPCOs as required to ensure save lists
        are completed within established time frames.
        5.4.3.2. Once a save list is complete in RDS, lead AFGLSC RPCOs must notify the
        applicable SPM/SSM it is complete and provide AFMC Form 110 data for review and
 26                                                       AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012


       subsequent submittal to AMARG. SPMs/SSMs are authorized a maximum of 14 days to
       review the save list and coordinate any add-ons or deletions with RPCOs.
       5.4.3.3. SPM/SSM forwards the completed save list to the AMARG Business Office and
       a copy to the lead AFGLSC RPCO Upon completion of the review.
          5.4.3.3.1. SPM/SSM will provide validated list of tail numbers associated with each
          save list with each reclamation project submittal to AMARG/OBW and coordinate
          any changes throughout the project until completion.
          5.4.3.3.2. SPM/SSM personnel will advise the lead AFGSLC RPCO of any items
          removed from the save list as potential candidates for reclamation along with
          supporting rationale for each NSN removed. Lead AFGLSC RPCOs will route this
          feedback to the responsible item managers along with supporting rational on each
          NSN removed.
   5.4.4. Lead AFGSLC RPCOs will advise SPM/SSM, AMARG Business Office, and RPM
   when established timelines cannot be met, and provide an updated estimated completion date.
   Situations not resolved locally will be elevated through the chain of command.
   5.4.5. A 45-day goal is established at AMARG to prepare reclamation work control
   documents, loading save list information into the AMARG Business System and providing a
   workload cost estimate to the applicable SPM/SSM. A maximum six-month suspense period
   is established for the actual removal and shipment of the save list parts. When feasible, time
   periods should be minimized and the projects completed as soon as possible.
   5.4.6. AMARG must review the status of all current and forecasted programmed reclamation
   projects monthly. If delays are anticipated, AMARG/OBW will notify SPM/SSM personnel
   to ensure funding and AMARG manpower availability will not be impacted.
5.5. D035G List Initiation:
   5.5.1. RPM begins development of each new save list by initiating a reclamation request
   through D035G RDS. Both repairable and consumable NSNs (AF managed items only) are
   identified. RDS interfaces with the D200A and D200F systems to generate save list
   candidates by NSN. RDS cannot generate a save list unless the MDS is listed in the D200F
   MDS table. If Weapon systems are not included in D200F (i.e. contractor logistics supported
   weapon systems), SPM/SSM personnel must work with their supporting item management
   function to develop alternate means of identifying and tracking reclamation requirements.
   5.5.2. When RDS has produced an initial list of save list candidates, they are released
   through RDS by the RPM. The RPM also transmits an e-mail notification summarizing save
   list project details to each AFGLSC RPCO, the SPM/SSM, and AMARG. Notices include
   information on the number of NSN candidates released, save list project number, aircraft
   MDS, AF Form 913 project number, lead AFGLSC RPCO (RPCO located at the ALC
   having SPM/SSM/EIM responsibility for aircraft being reclaimed) for the save list, and other
   pertinent information. This notification starts the timeline for the save list development
   cycle.
   5.5.3. RPCOs release all candidate items through RDS and provide supplemental
   instructions as required.
AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                      27


   5.5.4. IMs, ESs and IM supervisors are notified of pending RDS workload upon login to
   D035G. See AFMAN 23-110, Vol 3, Pt 1, Chap 9, for additional information about RDS
   Reclamation.
5.6. Save List Candidate Considerations:
   5.6.1. The preparation of comprehensive programmed reclamation save lists is critical to the
   success of the AF reclamation program. The RDS system identifies candidate items which
   must be thoroughly evaluated to determine if they should be included on the save list. Some
   of the questions that must be considered include:
   5.6.2. Is it economically feasible to reclaim the part? Does requirements computation data
   indicate a need for the item? Is it likely the item can be successfully reclaimed? ES
   personnel must consider physical characteristics and technical requirements in determining if
   parts are suitable for reclamation. For example, certain aircraft parts are designated “drill to
   fit” upon installation and are not valid reclamation candidates. In other cases, parts may be
   made of rubber or other materials that do not maintain original shape or fit if reclaimed. IMs
   and ESs have authority to delete save list candidates that cannot be successfully or
   economically reclaimed.
5.7. Determining the Correct Quantity Information for the AFMC Form 110s:
   5.7.1. The quantity block must reflect the actual buy/repair requirement, even if the number
   far exceeds the quantity of parts that could possibly be reclaimed from the aircraft on the
   programmed reclamation project. The number of aircraft initially assigned to a specific
   reclamation project is subject to change. Documenting actual requirement quantities ensures
   no matter how many aircraft are added to or deleted from the specific reclamation project, the
   proper number of parts will be removed.
   5.7.2. For example, if there are initially 10 aircraft on the project and each aircraft can yield
   one part, IMs might be inclined to enter the quantity 10 on the AFMC Form 110. However,
   if additional aircraft are added to the project later, a maximum of 10 parts can be reclaimed.
   Beyond the 10th aircraft inducted into work, the item will not reflect as a requirement and the
   parts will not be reclaimed. Entering the total buy quantity ensures the correct amount will
   be reclaimed from the project, no matter how many aircraft might be added to the project.
   5.7.3. This same logic holds true for items having a small requirement quantity. If a limited
   quantity of an item is required, entering the actual number ensures that once the required
   quantity has been reclaimed, no additional, excess parts will be reclaimed.
   5.7.4. Under-reclaiming deprives the wholesale system of assets that could offset a future
   buy; over- reclaiming creates wholesale stock excesses. Neither condition should occur if the
   actual buy/repair requirements are entered on the AFMC Form 110.
5.8. Save List Consideration for Items Not Included in the RDS Interrogation
Output: SPM/SSM/EIM/IM/ES personnel may recommend items be added to save list projects
based on experience gained through day-to-day weapon system support knowledge. Manually
prepared AFMC Forms 110 must be submitted by SPMs/SSMs since recommended additions
will not be included in the initial RDS save list project. All requests require coordination
through the assigned IM, ES, and supervision chain.
 28                                                        AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012


5.9. Preparation of AFMC Form 110s for Valid Candidate Items: When IM/ES review
determines an item is a valid reclamation candidate, the RDS generated AFMC Form 110 must
be completed. It is important to include all information that will be useful to the reclaiming
activity and increase the likelihood of successfully reclaiming the part. Refer to Attachment 2
for AFMC Form 110 preparation instructions. The IM, ES and IM supervisors must review all
forms to ensure they are complete and contain correct technical order information, etc. Making
corrections prior to final supervisory approval is critical because corrections can be
communicated and transmitted electronically. Errors discovered after final supervisory approval
must be worked manually. Incomplete or inaccurate forms must be corrected prior to final
supervision approval. When an IM supervisor approves an AF Form 110, they are forwarded
through RDS back to the designated RPCO.
5.10. Due-in Asset Records for Programmed Reclamation NSNs:
   5.10.1. IMs must not load due-in asset records for save list items potentially available from
   reclamation projects. Loading due-ins creates an unacceptable level of risk and unreasonable
   expectations.
   5.10.2. The potential yield from reclamation projects is too variable to risk loading positive
   due-in quantities. There is no way to accurately project what percentage of assets might
   generate in a useful condition. If aircraft have been in storage at AMARG for a long time
   before undergoing programmed reclamation, they have most likely been subjected to
   numerous priority reclamation actions while in storage and the likelihood of generating
   serviceable or reparable assets diminishes as time goes on in the desert environment. If due-
   ins are loaded and procurement actions are deferred in anticipation of receiving the
   reclamation assets, the ability to support customer requirements will be compromised if
   reclamation assets do not materialize. As a result, IM’s lose critical procurement lead-time
   when this happens.
   5.10.3. If parts are successfully reclaimed, there is a risk of procuring excess assets because
   the reclamation due-ins are not loaded. If monthly save list activity reports show
   programmed reclamation projects are generating a flow of useable assets, IMs must review
   the current asset position. If the reclaimed assets, along with outstanding PRs, create an
   excess condition, IMs must evaluate the situation. IMs must decide if the reclamation effort
   should be terminated or the PR quantities should be reduced or terminated. Compression of
   the save list development cycle timeline and completion of programmed reclamation projects
   in a timely manner at AMARG minimize the risk of generating excesses.
5.11. Finalizing the Save List Requirements for Submission to AMARG:
   5.11.1. RPCOs review AF Form 110s and check to ensure all required actions were
   completed. Spot checks of the forms may identify improper T.O.s, erroneous quantities and
   other miscellaneous error conditions. RPCOs work with IMs to correct errors and then
   forward the save list requirements to the Lead AFGLSC RPCO for consolidation. After a
   final quality check, the Lead AFGSLC RPCO forwards the completed save list to the
   SPM/SSM for review and transmittal to AMARG. (Refer to paragraph 6.6.2)
   5.11.2. Deliver AFMC Form 110s to AMARG electronically or paper form. Save list
   projects can produce hundreds of forms and electronic transmission is highly encouraged.
AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                    29


5.12. Late Generating Save List Candidate Items: Requirements change with every
computation cycle so it is almost certain there will be additional candidate requirements to
consider during the course of executing a given programmed reclamation save list. The common
term for these items is “stragglers”. They may generate from D035G any time after the initial set
of save list candidates has been released. IMs must consider adding the items to the current save
list if requirements have increased and reclamation offers potential relief or deleting items if
requirements have decreased and continuing reclamation would generate excess assets. If the
save list has progressed to “in work” status at AMARG, it may be better to submit the “straggler”
requirements as Category “B” priority removals instead of adding them to the save list in
progress. The IM must confer with SSM/SPM WSRP to assess the timing and determine the
best course of action.
5.13. Communication and Coordination: During the reclamation process, it is essential to
have an active dialogue among all key players. AFMC Form 110 data must provide AMARG as
much useful information as possible to increase the likelihood of successful reclamation.
AMARG must seek assistance from ALC technical resources if additional information is
required.
5.14. AMARG Save List Actions:
   5.14.1. AMARG responsibility for an AF programmed reclamation project begins when
   AMARG/OBW receives the complete save list package from the aircraft SPM/SSM.
   5.14.2. AMARG/OBW accepts the new workload and advises the AMARG Commodities
   Reclamation Squadron and AMARG/OBR points of contact a new save list has been
   received.
   5.14.3. If any of the project aircraft are authorized for transfer to the NMUSAF program
   after completion of reclamation, AMARG must take care to limit the scope of the save list
   applied to those specific aircraft. The Museum and SPM/SSM must review the save list to
   identify items that, if removed, would limit the display value of the aircraft to the museum
   program. However, to the extent possible, all critical items, R-1 current buy requirements
   and R-2 current year repair requirements must be reclaimed. It may be possible to substitute
   condemned or unsuitable items in place of the reclaimed items to preserve the outward
   appearance of the aircraft.
5.15. AMARG Save List Preparation and Aircraft Reclamation:
   5.15.1. AMARG/OBW forwards the complete package of AFMC Form 110s for the new
   save list project to the Reclamation Planning Function.
   5.15.2. AMARG reclamation planners assemble a detailed technical data package for each
   AFMC Form 110 line item. Reclamation controllers load stock number data records if the
   items are new to the AMARG reclamation system or verify the accuracy of the item record
   data if the NSN has been loaded previously.
   5.15.3. AMARG reclamation planning personnel review the save list items, coordinate
   changes/deletions with SPM/SSM, IM and ES points of contact, finalize the content and
   prepare the save list technical work package for execution at AMARG. Reclamation
   planners must consider all technical aspects related to removal of parts, identify requirements
   for and determine the availability of special tools and equipment, determine if AMARG has
30                                                       AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012


  the capability to test and verify the condition of the reclaimed materiel based on the
  inspection criteria furnished by the ES. The development of a comprehensive work package
  for each line item on the save list increases the likelihood of successfully locating and
  removing requested items.
  5.15.4. AMARG planners estimate the hour to accomplish each programmed save list
  project and send the estimate to AMARG/OBW. AMARG/OBW communicates this cost
  information to AFGLSC/FMR and SPM/SSM points of contact no later than 45 days after
  receiving the save list package. Afterwards, SPM/SSM, AFGLSC/FMR, and AMARG/OBW
  personnel review the requirement to ensure adequate funding is available. If additional funds
  are required the team will work together to secure funding. Aircraft associated with each
  specific project can be inducted into AMARG’s programmed reclamation work processes
  and the save list parts removed and shipped once it’s determined adequate funding has been
  secured. Upfront funding forecast efforts must ensure adequate funding is available to
  support programmed save list removal schedules.
  5.15.5. AMARG must make every reasonable effort to remove urgency code R1 (current
  year buy) and R2 (current year repair) save list items as early in the reclamation process as
  feasible. Prompt reclamation of these requirements has the potential to offset procurement
  action and increase the value of the reclamation process to the AF. Reference AFMCMAN
  23-1, Secondary Item Requirements System (D200.A, D200N).
  5.15.6. During the course of reclamation, if AMARG finds different NSNs or part numbers
  installed than those listed as acceptable on the AFMC Form 110s, they must contact the IM
  regarding the acceptability of substitute parts. AMARG must initiate such queries in a
  prompt manner and the IMs must respond within five workdays.
  5.15.7. If AMARG maintenance personnel identify parts they believe should have been
  included on the save list, they must contact the responsible IM. AMARG’s experience with
  past projects or priority reclamation activity may help identify parts not identified during
  initial save list requirements development processes. IMs must respond within five
  workdays and either add the items to the existing save list, submit Category B priority
  reclamation requests if the save list is almost completed, or advise AMARG there is no
  requirement for the parts in question.
  5.15.8. If AMARG finds the reclamation of certain parts to be questionable from an
  economic or materiel condition consideration, they must query the IM to determine if they
  should continue removing the parts in question. The IM determines if there is justification to
  continue reclamation and notifies AMARG of the decision.
  5.15.9. All AMARG requests for clarification must be resolved by the IM before the save
  list can be completed. Delays must be communicated to the RPM by AMARG/OBW. If the
  RPM is unable to assist in obtaining requested information the reclamation request will be
  denied and save list project processed for closure. IMs must be notified on all denials and
  use the AMARG Form 44 process if requirements for parts in question remain.
  5.15.10. When save list parts have been successfully removed, cleaned, inspected and tested
  within AMARG’s capability, they are tagged to reflect the materiel condition code and
  prepared for shipment. DoD materiel condition code tags, DD Forms 1574, 1575 and 1577-2
  are used on all reclaimed parts.
AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                     31


   5.15.11. AMARG SRAN FN2373 shipping documents are utilized to ship reclaimed
   materiel. A routine shipment priority 13 is assigned unless otherwise directed. AMARG
   must ensure any special “Mark For” instructions furnished by the requisitioner are included
   on the reclamation shipping document.
   5.15.12. AMARG packaging is in accordance with DoD standards. Deviations from
   established packaging methods must be annotated on the Form 44 and approved by the
   responsible packaging specialist.
5.16. AMARG Reclamation Project Completion:
   5.16.1. An AMARG programmed reclamation project is complete when all of the reclaimed
   parts have been shipped and all save list related administrative and financial actions have
   been completed.
   5.16.2. When AMARG completes execution of the programmed reclamation project,
   AMARG/OBW upon SPM/SSM and AF/A8PB direction either assigns the aircraft to a RIT
   project (if the aircraft is assigned to an STX storage project) or initiates disposal processing
   (if the aircraft is assigned to an STD project).
5.17. AMARG Reclamation Activity Reports: AMARG must provide SPMs/SSMs, RPCOs
and RPM with activity reports summarizing reclamation actions for each current programmed
reclamation project. (Refer to Chapter 11) for additional information.
5.18. Disposition of Aircraft Completing Programmed Reclamation:
   5.18.1. When all of the save list actions for a specific project have been completed,
   AMARG/OBW must contact the SPM/SSM to determine disposition of the project aircraft.
   5.18.2. SPM/SSM may elect to retain some or all of the reclaimed aircraft and direct
   AMARG to assign them to a RIT project or SPM/SSM may provide disposal authority. If
   the SPM/SSM authorizes disposal, AMARG initiates the utilization screening process and
   either transfers aircraft to authorized recipients who pay all associated transfer costs or the
   aircraft are prepared for final disposal.

                                           Chapter 6

                                PRIORITY RECLAMATION

6.1. Priority Reclamation Objectives and Categories: Priority reclamation of parts from
AMARG stored aircraft provides support for critical operational requirements that cannot be
satisfied from retail or wholesale system stocks. The highest priority requests, MILSTRIP
priorities 01 through 08, are referred to as Category A priority reclamation. Category B priority
reclamation, MILSTRIP priorities 09 through 13, is used in lieu of procurement to replenish
stocks in advance of customer demands. The term “priority reclamation” is also referred to as
“priority removal”. Whenever possible, generation of serviceable reclamation parts is critical to
increasing both the value and success of the AF reclamation program. (Refer to Chapter 4) for
general reclamation policies and procedures.
6.2. Consideration of Reclamation Prior to Initiating Purchase Requests (PRs): AMARG
priority reclamation potential must always be considered before initiating a PR. IMs must
review aircraft application data and document reclamation was either attempted and did not
generate the required assets or was not a viable option before initiating PRs. AMARG RCS:
LOG (MM) M-7148 report lists AMARG aircraft that must be considered for potential
reclamation support.
6.3. Determining if Priority Reclamation is Appropriate and Initiation Process: Priority
Reclamation is considered when a priority requirement cannot be satisfied from retail system
stocks and all other sources have been exhausted. If stock replenishment from procurement,
repair sources, or other means is imminent, requirements should remain in backorder status and
filled on a priority basis. When the SOS determines a priority requirement cannot be satisfied,
the item manager or designated SOS representative is authorized to initiate an AMARG Priority
Reclamation Form 44 request. Afterwards, AMARG’s web-based Form 44 application tool will
be used by the SOS to route each request to the appropriate SPM/SSM/EIM for review and
approval submission to AMARG. DLA Aviation is the primary focal point for AMARG Form
44 initiation actions on DLA-managed items. Alternative initiation processes will be determined
by DLA.
6.4. Category A Priority Reclamation Requisitions:
   6.4.1. Category A, priority 01-08, reclamation requisitions are processed to remove aircraft
   parts or engine parts on an expedited basis to satisfy high priority requirements. Category A
   priority reclamation actions normally occurs when wholesale system inventories are depleted
   and procurement or repair sources cannot provide items to customer within required time
   frames.
   6.4.2. MILSTRIP high priority requirements passed to AMARG for support will be worked
   on a 24-hour basis unless it is unsafe or impractical. AMARG will arrange for the most
   expeditious removal and shipment for these high priority requirements. They will also
   provide removal/shipping status through web based tools or telephone as required to SPM
   WSRO. The SPM WSRO will provide AMARG status to the customer.
AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                     33


6.5. Category B Priority Reclamation Requisitions:
   6.5.1. Category B, priority 9-13, reclamation requisitions are utilized when IMs require
   supply system stock replenishment to support anticipated requirements and there is no
   current programmed reclamation project to generate required parts. They are also utilized
   when IMs require a larger quantity of parts be removed, utilizing a negotiated, incremental
   delivery schedule. This generates an orderly flow of parts being removed and shipped in
   time to meet customer needs. It also allows AMARG more flexibility in allocating
   manpower resources and managing its priority reclamation workload.
   6.5.2. Utilization of Category B priority reclamation allows AMARG to schedule workload
   more efficiently in order to satisfy both Category A and B requests in a timely manner.
   Utilizing a lower priority commensurate with stock replenishment/repair requirements
   permits IMs to bridge gaps in support (parts shortages, delays in meeting delivery schedules,
   etc.) without abusing the priority system.
   6.5.3. IMs should consider submitting Category B priority reclamation requisitions when
   stockage is a problem and they are repeatedly submitting Category A requests for the same
   items. Acquiring priority reclamation items for stock replenishment allows time for
   inspection of materiel, and, if necessary, repair, and return to serviceable stocks available to
   support future requirements.
6.6. Authorization to Submit Priority Reclamation Requests: All priority reclamation
requests must be submitted to AMARG by the responsible SPM/SSM using AMARG’s web-
based Form 44 application tool. AMARG Forms 44 are initiated by the responsible SOS as
stated in paragraph 6.3 and forwarded to the SPM/SSM/EIM via AMARG Form 44 web-based
tool for approval, donor aircraft selection, and submission.
6.7. Requesting Materiel in the Appropriate Supply Condition Code:
   6.7.1. IM priority reclamation requisitions should reflect the customers’ true supply
   condition code requirement.
   6.7.2. If the customer’s requirement is for serviceable (supply condition code A) materiel,
   AMARG should make every reasonable effort to inspect and test the reclaimed parts to verify
   true materiel condition. The requesting activity must provide AMARG comprehensive
   inspection criteria such as technical data references, drawings, or pictures. This ensures
   AMARG is providing the best support possible for AF critical operational requirements. It
   also minimizes potential for providing customers with “R” condition parts that prove to be
   unserviceable and result in additional delays.
   6.7.3. If parts are required in serviceable condition and AMARG does not have maintenance
   skills or test equipment to determine the true condition, they must notify the requesting IM.
   IM personnel must then verify the customer is willing to accept parts in condition code R and
   notify SPM WSRO.
      6.7.3.1. Circumstances may justify requesting parts in F or R condition but they should
      be the exception, not the norm.
      6.7.3.2. SPM WRSO will work through the engineering/technical community to
      determine whether the risk of installing a part in unknown condition is acceptable for the
 34                                                      AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012


       weapon system platform or whether the part must be routed for inspection and/or
       repair/overhaul prior to shipment to the requesting organization.
6.8. Responsibilities for Requesting Accurate Priorities and Quantities:
   6.8.1. IMs requesting priority reclamation support are responsible for ensuring requests
   passed to AMARG contain accurate priorities and reasonable quantities. AMARG has a
   finite number of man-hours available to accomplish the priority reclamation workload.
   Exaggerated quantities and priorities negatively impact AMARG’s ability to satisfy valid
   requirements expeditiously. Category A, removal requests must always reflect the
   customer’s minimum required quantity. If larger than normal quantities are required, the
   minimum quantity possible should be processed with a higher priority and remaining
   requirements submitted on lower priority removal requests with negotiated, incremental
   shipment dates.
   6.8.2. Priority reclamation requests passed to AMARG must reflect the priority of the
   customer’s MILSTRIP requisition or backorder in the wholesale supply system. AMARG
   has both the authority and responsibility to challenge priorities and quantities when abuses
   are suspected. Questions or concerns related to the challenge process should be referred to
   the 401SCMS/GUMC RPM for resolution.
6.9. AMARG Priority Reclamation Projected Shipment Time Frames:
   6.9.1. AMARG’s goal is to complete each priority reclamation request as soon as possible.
   The general time frames listed in Table 6.1 are for reference purposes only and illustrate
   potential parts removal scenarios. The customer’s original required delivery date (RDD)
   may no longer be relevant or may have already passed before the requirement is submitted to
   AMARG for priority reclamation action. There is no way to determine what other actions
   may have occurred between the time a requisition was placed in backorder status at the depot
   and the time it was passed to AMARG for priority reclamation. Because of this situation,
   when requirements are received at AMARG, they are assigned an AMARG projected
   shipment date commensurate with the customer’s MILSTRIP requisition priority, JCS
   project code, MICAP indicator and AMARG expected time frames shown in Table 6.1.
   Requirements are then integrated into the pending AMARG reclamation workload, based on
   factors considered above in establishing an AMARG projected shipment date.
   6.9.2. Standard MILSTRIP shipment time frames cannot be applied to the AMARG priority
   reclamation process. Standard time frames are based on the shipment of serviceable parts
   from a warehouse. Priority reclamation parts from AMARG aircraft must first be located on
   the aircraft/engine, removed, cleaned, inspected/bench checked, packaged and shipped to
   customers. In consideration of these required actions, the following flexible time frames
   were developed for AMARG customers’ general information and for planning purposes.
   These time frames are very general and allow for a wide variety of circumstances that may
   influence actual times required to satisfy priority reclamation requests.
AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                    35

   6.9.3. Table 6.1, Degree of Parts Removal Complexity reflect AMARG reclamation
   planners’ best estimate of the processing steps and flow days required to complete each
   priority reclamation request. Many circumstances have the potential to impact the required
   number of flow days. The range of days within each “degree of complexity” category allows
   AMARG planners further latitude in assigning due dates. The following are general,
   simplistic examples of each degree of parts removal complexity:
       6.9.3.1. Low: An instrument easily removed from a cockpit panel, requiring minimum
       time to clean, bench check, package and ship.
       6.9.3.2. Medium:      A structural fitting requiring aircraft jacking or special
       tools/equipment to effect removal, etc. but is relatively simple to clean, inspect, package
       and ship.
       6.9.3.3. High: A wing requiring heavy equipment/ballasts to accomplish the removal,
       construction of aircraft support modules and extensive packing and crating work to
       prepare it for shipment.
   6.9.4. The “start time” for performance measurement begins when an SPM/SSM approved
   AMARG Form 44 removal request is posted to the AMARG Form 44 web site or faxed to
   AMARG if the web site is not available. The “end time” occurs when the shipment is
   released to transportation.
   6.9.5. Table 6.1. Assumes that if the customer requires “A” condition, serviceable parts and
   AMARG has the inspection capability, flow days will be computed to include time for
   AMARG inspection/bench check.
   6.9.6. The projected shipment time frame is measured in “workdays”, not calendar days.
   AMARG normal days of operation are Monday through Friday. Exceptions are made for
   extremely urgent requirements that must be worked on a continuing basis until completion.
 36                                                        AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012


   6.9.7. Once established, estimated ship dates must not be changed arbitrarily. AMARG
   must update status and notify customers through AMARG Form 44 Database web based
   tools or telephone when priority 01-08 shipment dates cannot be met.
6.10. Factors Affecting Priority Reclamation Time frames:
   6.10.1. Many factors influence the length of time required to complete each priority
   reclamation request.
   6.10.2. Initially, the most important thing is for AMARG to receive a complete and
   technically correct request. Correct technical data and comprehensive inspection criteria are
   especially critical to the success of the process and increase AMARG’s ability to respond in a
   timely manner. Incorrect information or the absence of critical data cause unnecessary
   delays and require AMARG to return requests to obtain necessary information.
   6.10.3. Some parts are difficult to access and remove from aircraft/engines. They may be
   installed in locations that are difficult to reach and require the use of specialized equipment.
   Certain removals may also require aircraft be placed on a hard surface so they can be put on
   jacks, etc. in order to remove the parts. Most priority reclamation parts removals occur out in
   the desert environment under less than desirable conditions which may add additional time to
   the process.
   6.10.4. While AMARG has extensive technical data resources, they do not have complete
   technical files on every weapons system/engine. It may be necessary to request copies of
   pertinent technical information prior to priority removal of the requested parts.
   6.10.5. Due to the extensive variety of aircraft stored at AMARG, it is both impractical and
   impossible for AMARG to have complete sets of peculiar tools and support equipment for
   each MDS. It is sometimes necessary for AMARG to borrow or acquire special tools and
   equipment required to accomplish the removal.
      6.10.5.1. AMARG may require SPM/SSM/EIM/IM/ES assistance in identifying, locating
      and acquiring required tools and equipment needed to remove the parts. In some
      instances, it may be necessary to provide AMARG with specialized shipping containers
      or stands. If there are no suitable specialized containers available, AMARG may be
      required to fabricate specialized shipping devices.
      6.10.5.2. AMARG must occasionally arrange for the maintenance-to-maintenance loan
      of required specialized tools/equipment. AMARG may also require official approval to
      deviate from using specified equipment, technical data and procedures or may require
      authority to locally manufacture tools required for removal of parts.
   6.10.6. The priority reclamation timetable must also include the time required to inspect and
   bench check all the parts if AMARG has the capability. If the true supply condition code can
   be determined by AMARG maintenance personnel, parts must not be shipped in R condition.
6.11. Submission of Priority Reclamation Requisitions to AMARG:
   6.11.1. Priority reclamation requisitions are submitted electronically to AMARG via
   AMARG Form 44 website. Access can be requested through https://absweb.dm.af.mil/.
   Requests may be faxed or e-mailed to AMARG if the site is not operational due to technical
   problems. Requests for Category B support are submitted to AMARG utilizing the same
   procedures as Category A.
AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                     37


   6.11.2. The site contains information regarding processing of AMARG Form 44 requests,
   tracking requests through the AMARG system, a complete history of previous submissions
   and many other features. The site is subject to frequent revisions and updates. Contact
   AMARG for assistance if questions or concerns arise.
6.12. Donor Aircraft Selection for Priority Reclamation Support: In accordance with AFI
16-402, SPMs/SSMs must designate specific donor aircraft on each AMARG Form 44 submitted
to AMARG for priority reclamation. As a general rule, parts requested to support priority
reclamation requisitions should be initially sourced from reclamation or RIT category aircraft,
If not available these reclamation categories, the SPM/SSM must identify potential donors in XX
or XV status. If those also fail to yield a satisfactory part and the requirement is urgent enough
to justify removal from inviolate status, (XS) aircraft, the SPM/SSM must obtain authority from
HQ USAF/A4LY.
6.13. Data Elements for Priority Reclamation Shipping Documents: AMARG generates
shipping documents for priority reclamation materiel utilizing data elements furnished in the
AMARG Form 44 on-line requisitioning system. The requesting activity must be certain all
pertinent information such as Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) Project Codes, mark-for information for
the receiving activity, special inspection criteria, etc. is furnished for proper completion of the
AMARG Form 44 requirement. It is critical all information is accurate to ensure requests are
processed as quickly as possible.
6.14. Supply Account Receipt Processing for AMARG Priority Reclamation
Shipments: Priority reclamation receipts must be received and issued through the supply
account receiving activity in the same manner as any other receipt. Normal funding rules apply
– free issue is not authorized. Investment items received in R condition may be issued to
maintenance for condition determination and then processed through supply as an
issue/backorder release to the customer or turned in as unacceptable condition materiel.
6.15. Notice of non-Availability of Priority Reclamation Materiel: If a priority reclamation
request cannot be satisfied, the customer and SSM/SPM WSRO must be notified at the earliest
possible time. Non-availability notification is critical because the SPM/SSM/EIM/IM must seek
another source to satisfy the user’s aging requirement.
6.16. Providing Shipping Information to the Customer: AMARG must provide customers
with shipment tracking information (date and method) as soon as possible.

                                            Chapter 7

                          NON-PROGRAMMED RECLAMATION

7.1. Non-programmed Reclamation:
   7.1.1. The term non-programmed reclamation is used to describe reclamation of a single
   aircraft or small number of aircraft at locations other than AMARG. SPMs/SSMs are
   responsible for managing and coordinating timely non-programmed reclamation actions
   applicable to their weapon systems. Refer to Chapters 4 and 5 for general reclamation and
   programmed reclamation procedures applicable to non-programmed reclamation.
   7.1.2. Due to unique circumstances encountered in non-programmed reclamation scenarios,
   SPMs/SSMs may need to consult with the RPM on a case-by-case basis.
       7.1.2.1. The following list provides examples of non-programmed candidate aircraft:
           7.1.2.1.1. Crash damaged or uneconomically reparable.
           7.1.2.1.2. Located at AF training facilities.
           7.1.2.1.3. Authorized for static display.
           7.1.2.1.4. Not cost effective to transport to AMARG.
           7.1.2.1.5. Ground Trainer (GITA).
7.2. Non-programmed Save List Age: The SPM/SSM may utilize an existing non-
programmed save list or one for a comparable MDS if all actions can be accomplished within the
one year time period the save list is valid for. A current non-programmed save list may be
utilized as many times as necessary during this period. When the save list reaches its nine month
point, the SPM/SSM must request the RPM initiate a new save list to support additional aircraft.
The new save list will be developed in time to replace the aging save list. SPMs/SSMs are
authorized as required to maintain a current non-programmed save list available for immediate
use on a continual basis to support workload forecasts.
7.3. Assignment of Non-programmed Reclamation Project/Save List Numbers: Format as
follows: For example, a T-37 trainer non-programmed reclamation project number, assigned in
2009, would be constructed as RCL-9T-001. The next sequential number, for an F-4 fighter,
would be RCL-9F-002.
AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                    39

                                      T = Trainer

   7.3.1. When a new save list is required, the SPMs/SSMs must request the RPM assign a new
   non-programmed reclamation save list project number and initiate the save list requirements
   development process in RDS (D035G). SPM/SSM personnel must factor in save list
   development lead times (approximately 30 days) and match them against customer need
   dates. This will ensure units performing reclamation receive save lists in a timely manner to
   support maintenance and aircraft movement/disposal processing schedules.
   7.3.2. The RPM notifies the requesting SPM/SSM and AFGLSC RPCOs when a project
   number has been assigned and a save list is requested through RDS. AFGLSC RPCOs must
   track save list development progress and follow-up with Squadron/PD monitors to minimize
   delays. The Lead AFGSLC RPCO is responsible for ensuring a completed save list is
   submitted to the requesting SPM/SSM within 30 calendar days after the project is released by
   the RPM. Item manager and equipment specialist supervisors must work with RPCOs to
   ensure save lists are completed on time and take action to resolve delays. Once a save list is
   complete in RDS the Lead AFGLSC RPCOs must notify the applicable SPM/SSM it is ready
   and supply the AFMC Form 111 reclamation data for review.
   7.3.3. AFMC Form 111 is generated through RDS as a result of IM and ES decisions to
   document non-programmed save list requirements. Attachment 3 outlines information
   contained on AFMC Form 111. Electronic spreadsheets containing AF Form 111 data may
   be used.
   7.3.4. IM asset due-in records must not be adjusted to reflect parts potentially available from
   non-programmed reclamation projects. The relatively small number of aircraft subjected to
   this type of reclamation and unpredictability of the parts yield make due-in data unreliable
   and misleading.
7.4. SPM/SSM Parts Removal Limitations on Non-programmed Aircraft: The non-
programmed save list must be adapted to address each non-programmed save list use.
Limitations and restrictions on removals must be coordinated with the activity performing
reclamation functions. The SPM/SSM may limit the extent of non-programmed reclamation
parts removals from aircraft approved for transfer to museums and static display locations,

conversion to Aircraft Battle Damage Repair (ABDR) training aids, use as ground training
devices, etc.
7.5. Parts Removal Factors to Consider:
   7.5.1. Each non-programmed reclamation request is likely to have its own unique
   circumstances. The save list sent to the reclaiming activity will reflect adjustments made for
   that particular non-programmed reclamation request. In preparation for accomplishing non-
   programmed reclamation, SPMs/SSMs must consider the following factors to determine the
   range of items to include on each particular save list application and address disposal or
   transfer related issues:
   7.5.2. General condition of aircraft and circumstances that make it a candidate for non-
   programmed reclamation.
   7.5.3. Reclamation site and available support facilities.
   7.5.4. Technical limitations or special qualifications peculiar to items identified for
   reclamation.
   7.5.5. Availability of packaging materials and shipping facilities.
   7.5.6. Engine disposition from EIM –Options include engine removal, reclamation, or
   leaving in place. If reclaiming, disposition instructions will be required from EIM.
   7.5.7. Availability of special shipping devices?
   7.5.8. Aircraft demilitarization decisions/hazardous material considerations what action must
   be taken prior to transfer or disposal?
   7.5.9. Hazardous materials decisions removal and disposition at the reclamation site.
   7.5.10. Any other factors that might influence successful project completion.
7.6. Manpower and Funding to Accomplish Non-programmed Reclamation: SPM/SSM
must ensure units requesting non-programmed save list support understand planning manpower
and funding requirements are normally the responsibility of the possessing unit. Manpower
needed to remove parts from aircraft for turn-in to supply may be obtained from sources such as
base level maintenance personnel who are technically qualified to perform required actions, or
qualified Guard or Reserve personnel. Non-programmed save lists will not be initiated in RDS
unless resource requirements planned and coordinated. Disposal of aircraft will not take place
until AF reclamation requirements are met.
7.7. Reclaiming Function Responsibilities:
   7.7.1. Organizations tasked with accomplishing non-programmed reclamation must record
   actions taken and properly account for all reclaimed assets in accordance with instructions
   provided by the SPM/SSM. There may be occasions where SPM/SSM or unit personnel may
   request items be added to save lists. These cases should be worked on an as required basis.
   NSNs being recommended should be identified and supporting justification be routed back to
   the assigned item manager for consideration. Lead AFGLSC RPCOs must assist in
   coordinating these actions and ensure feedback is provided to the requestor to allow for a
   final decision to be made in time to meet project completion timelines.
AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                    41


  7.7.2. Reclaimed parts must be turned in to the local supply account as found on base, non-
  credit turn-ins and shipped to appropriate depot wholesale stocks or the repair activity
  specified on the AFMC Form 111/accompanying spreadsheet. If the parts are turned in to the
  Standard Base Supply System, they should be identified as materiel condition code A, if
  serviceable, F, if reparable or K if in unknown condition. If the parts are turned in or shipped
  directly to depot wholesale stocks, condition codes A, F or R, reclaimed materiel in unknown
  condition, apply.
  7.7.3. Personnel performing the non-programmed reclamation workload are not authorized
  to retain any parts for local use.
  7.7.4. Reclaimed parts must be protected from damage and packaged for shipment in
  compliance with AFI 24-203, Preparation and Movement of Air Force Cargo.
  7.7.5. The reclaiming activity must annotate the AFMC Form 111/electronic spreadsheet to
  indicate parts removed and turned in to the local supply activity or annotate why removals
  were not accomplished. When reclamation is complete, return annotated forms/spreadsheet
  listing to the issuing SPM/SSM. SPM/SSM personnel will forward a copy to their Lead
  RPCO for filing. All action must be completed within 12 months of save list release by
  RPM.
  7.7.6. Packing, Handling and Crating will be funded in accordance with AFI 65-601, Budget
  Guidance and Procedures, Volume 1, paragraph 10.40.4.
7.8. Non-programmed Reclamation Considerations for Museum and Static Display
Aircraft:
  7.8.1. When HQ USAF/A8PB offers aircraft to the NMUSAF Program, museum personnel
  must contact the applicable SPM/SSM to determine the scope of any pending reclamation on
  subject aircraft. Aircraft may lose historical and display value when key components are
  removed (i.e. canopy, control surfaces, etc). NMUSAF may negotiate save list exceptions
  with the SPM/SSM/EIM or may choose to reject the aircraft prior to transfer. Upon
  acceptance of the aircraft into the NMUSAF Program, the reclaiming activity must provide to
  NMUSAF a copy of the completed AFMC Form 111/Reclamation Save List. Refer to AFI
  84-103, U. S. Air Force Heritage Program, for further guidance.
  7.8.2. Aircraft assigned to NMUSAF Program for display at NMUSAF, Wright-Patterson
  AFB, Ohio or subsequent reassignment to the National Air and Space Museum of the
  Smithsonian Institution, are exempt from all reclamation activity since they are the
  worldwide record copy for historical purposes. Refer to AFI 84-103, U. S. Air Force
  Heritage Program, for further guidance. Removals are limited to explosive devices,
  classified items and Nuclear Weapons Related Materiel.
  7.8.3. Aircraft or missiles transferred to the NMUSAF Program for display at other Air
  Force museums, static display locations, air parks or civilian sites are subject to reclamation.
  If the goal is to maintain the external appearance of the exhibit, parts must be carefully
  reclaimed to prevent or minimize any surface damage. In order to preserve the outward
  appearance, consideration must be given to substituting condemned or reparable items for
  parts removed during reclamation. In instances when condemned or reparable items are not
  available, it may be feasible to fabricate replacement parts critical to the external appearance
  of the display.
42                                                        AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012


     7.8.3.1. In accordance with AFI 84-103, gaining organizations bear the expense of
     moving, reclaiming or demilitarizing historical property. In the case of civilian
     museums, this cost cannot be at the government's expense.
  7.8.4. When it is necessary to ferry an aircraft to a military display site, non-programmed
  save list parts necessary for one-time flight must remain on the aircraft and be removed upon
  arrival at its final destination. The receiving organization is responsible for removing
  required parts, returning all assets to proper inventory control points, and notifying the
  SPM/SSM when all save list related actions have been completed.
  7.8.5. The NMUSAF must inform SPM/SSM of assigned military display sites and provide a
  point of contact at each receiving organization. The point of contact coordinates reclamation
  for each assigned aircraft by serial number. Receiving organizations are responsible for
  proper removal and shipment of all property identified for save list reclamation. Written
  certification will be accomplished by completing and signing AF Form 3580, USAF Museum
  Aerospace Vehicle Static Display Acceptance Condition and Safety Certificate. The
  NMUSAF must monitor reclamation progress and obtain written certification of completed
  actions for each loaned/donated aircraft. Activities having physical custody of aircraft are
  responsible for completion of all actions and related documentation associated with a save
  list.
  7.8.6. In some instances, additional part requirements generate after completion of the initial
  save list actions and transfer of the aircraft to the NMUSAF Program. SPMs/SSMs/EMs/IMs
  may request authority for removal of critical components installed on NMUSAF Program
  aircraft. The SPM/SSM/EIM/IM and NMUSAF may also negotiate exchange of condemned
  parts that preserve appearance, completeness and historical accuracy of the Museum exhibit
  in exchange for serviceable or reparable components critical to operational requirements.
  SPM/SSM direct these type of requests, in accordance with requirements in AFI 84-103,
  Chapter 6, Paragraph 6.23, to the Director, National Museum of the United States Air Force
  (NMUSAF/MUX), Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433-6518.
AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                   43

             *AIRCRAFT ENGINE AND ENGINE PARTS RECLAMATION

8.1. Engine Reclamation:
   8.1.1. Program office level Engine Item Managers (EIMs) must consider excess aircraft
   engines for use either as whole engines or for their potential to yield spare parts to support
   other engines. Engines eligible for reclamation may be located at AMARG, ALCs, or other
   locations. Engines will not be authorized for disposal by EIMs until actions are coordinated
   with the applicable engine SOS to determine what items require reclamation. (Exceptions:
   mishaps causing engine damage, ground trainers where parts configuration is outdated,
   legacy engines where no active requirements exist.) RDS generated save lists will be used as
   a baseline for determining reclamation requirements for engine reclamation projects.
       8.1.1.1. RDS generated save lists requests are initiated by inputting the Type Model
       Series (TMS) (e.g. F0100220, TF0033102A) and quantity of engines assigned to each
       project into RDS. Afterwards, it uses this information to pull bill of material data from
       D200F to gather the list of National Item Identification Number (NIINs) loaded against
       the TMS. Next, it compares the list of NIINs from D200F to requirements contained in
       D200A. NIINs with requirements in D200A are considered reclamation candidates and
       flow through the RDS workbasket process for subsequent review by IM, ES, and
       supervisory personnel. Once all items complete the RDS review process, items selected
       for reclamation are downloaded by the lead RPCO onto a save list spreadsheet. Save lists
       are valid for one year (reference paragraph 4.22.1).
       8.1.1.2. Program Managers managing a TMS(s) that is not maintained in D200F (e.g.
       contractor logistics supported) must establish an equivalent process for identifying and
       tracking engine reclamation requirements.
       8.1.1.3. The AMARG SRAN manager will contact the (AF Life Cycle Management
       Center (AFLCMC) EIM for proper storage classification instructions if an aircraft
       reclamation project or priority removal request requires engine removals from aircraft.
       Requestor will be responsible for returning engines to the required storage classification
       (action may require the cost to build/purchase a storage device).
8.2. EIM’s Utilization of Migration Plans: EIMs must obtain copies of all annual Migration
Plans from aircraft program managers (PMs) relating to their engines. When aircraft are no
longer inviolate, EIMs gain control of engines and have authority to remove engines or reclaim
parts. SPMs/SSMs are required to notify applicable EIMs when aircraft move into Type 2000 or
4000 storage at AMARG and become eligible for reclamation. EIM’s must coordinate with
aircraft program managers when requesting reclamation actions from aircraft in Type 2000
storage. EIMs’ knowledge of migration plan content gives them insight into long-term force
structure changes. Official Migration plans are consolidated by AFMC/A4U annually.
8.3. EIM Authority for Engines/Engine Parts Installed on Aircraft Assigned to Type 2000
or 4000 Storage: Engines installed on or obligated to AMARG aircraft assigned to Type 2000
or 4000 storage are available for reclamation. The EIM is the approval authority for all
engine/engine parts removals from aircraft in these storage categories. EIMs must coordinate
 44                                                        AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012


reclamation requests associated with engines with aircraft PMs before reclaiming items from
aircraft in Type 2000 storage.
8.4. Priority Reclamation of Engines/Engine parts located at AMARG: The process for
priority reclamation of whole engines or engine parts from other than inviolate aircraft is the
same as for aircraft parts. To ensure proper supply discipline, all reclamation requirement
requests for parts mounted to engines (internal or external) will be initiated by the source of
supply through AMARG Form 44, Removal Request process. The AMARG Form 44
submission must indicate the removal request is for an engine or engine part so it can be routed
to the EIM for approval and finally to AMARG’s EM for processing and subsequent updating of
the appropriate Comprehensive Engine Management System (CEMS) records. Removals should
be for engine parts that do not require teardown or disassembly. EIMs may approve exceptions
on a case-by- case basis.
8.5. Authority to Remove Engines/Engine Parts Obligated to Inviolate or Security
Assistance Program (SAP) Aircraft: When engines (installed or uninstalled) are obligated to
inviolate or SAP (Type 1000 storage) AMARG aircraft at AMARG, EIMs must direct requests
for priority removals to aircraft PMs. Aircraft PMs must then obtain written approval from HQ
USAF/A4LY. Note: C-5 aircraft require SECDEF approval per National Defense Authorization
Act direction. Aircraft PMs must notify EIMs of Air Staff’s approval or disapproval. If
approved, the EIM must submit an AMARG Form 44 to AMARG for priority removal action.
The EIM must provide AMARG a copy of HQ USAF/A4LY’s authorization for removal of the
engine or engine part from specific serial numbered Type 1000/1500 aircraft when submitting
AMARG Form 44s.
8.6. Disposition Instructions for Engines Installed on Reclamation Aircraft:
   8.6.1. When aircraft are initially assigned to 2000/4000 storage and the aircraft have
   installed or uninstalled obligated engines, AMARG’s EM must generate the RCS-MM (AR)
   7759 Report, Data for Engines Installed on Excess Aircraft. This report directs the EIM to
   furnish AMARG with disposition instructions for each engine serial number associated with
   the project aircraft. EIMs have several disposition options and may direct AMARG to either:
   8.6.1.1. Retain engines on aircraft when no requirements exist until further EIM instructions
   are received.
       8.6.1.2. Remove the engines and ship them to another location for non-programmed
       reclamation or direct AMARG to remove the engines and complete programmed
       reclamation.
       8.6.1.3. Remove the engines and store them at AMARG.
       8.6.1.4. Initiate AMARG Form 44 priority removals as required. Pre-coordination with
       AMARG is required to ensure adequate funding is available to support.
       8.6.1.5. Reclamation must be considered on engines being processed for disposal when
       they remain part of the aircraft.
8.7. Possible Storage Sites for Excess Aircraft Engines:
   8.7.1. Engines identified for reclamation may be:
       8.7.1.1. Located at an ALC, commercial storage facility, base, etc.
AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                   45


       8.7.1.2. Installed on aircraft stored at AMARG.
       8.7.1.3. Uninstalled but still obligated to a specific aircraft at AMARG.
       8.7.1.4. Located at AMARG, uninstalled, and no longer obligated to any aircraft.
8.8. Engine Reclamation Project Sites and Project Number Assignment: Reclamation is
accomplished at sites which have the capability to disassemble engines and reclaim the full range
of parts requested by IMs. Project numbers are assigned by the RPM in accordance with Table
8-1.
8.9. Engine Reclamation Project Planning Roles and Responsibilities (Refer to Attachment
6 Flowchart).
   8.9.1. AFLCMC will:
       8.9.1.1. Ensure EIMs review engines eligible for reclamation annually. This is
       accomplished each fiscal year based on retention computations and aircraft migration
       plans. Annual aircraft migration plans are normally finalized in the May/June time
       frame. Engine retention computations are normally accomplished the third or fourth
       quarter of each year. The Propulsion Division Chiefs approved quantity of excess
       engines will be provided to the engine SOS by 30 Sep.
       8.9.1.2. Ensure EIMs assist SOS Supply Chain Engine Management Focal Points as
       required in conducting analyses to determine if the benefits of setting up an engine
       reclamation project justify the expense for establishing one.
   8.9.2. Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC) will:
       8.9.2.1. Assign a TMS Reclamation Lead for each engine TMS who is responsible for
       ensuring all excess engines identified by EIMs are screened for reclamation requirements.
       TMS Reclamation Leads will establish an annual engine reclamation project forecast
       based on EIM inputs to support project planning activities. Planning activities must
       include a funding forecast process to secure funds well enough in advance to support
       engine reclamation project execution. Refer to Attachment 7 for a top level annual
       engine reclamation project planning process flowchart.
           8.9.2.1.1. CSAG-S funds will only be used to fund engine removals from aircraft
           when actions are required to pull the engine to support reclaiming AF managed
           budget code 8 items (e.g. priority pulls and RDS generated save lists).
       8.9.2.2. Based on inputs from the EIM, TMS Reclamation Leads will plan engine
       reclamation projects to identify and reclaim parts from excess engines. TMS
       Reclamation Leads will follow-up with EIMs NLT 30 September each year when excess
       engine reports are not received to determine, 1) there are no new excess engines, or 2)
       when the report will be submitted to the OS.
8.9.2.2.1. Requests an engine reclamation project number and initiate RDS save list
development process as required through the RPCO. The RPCO will contact the RPM to initiate
the project in RDS. RPCO will monitor each project through RDS to ensure reclamation
candidate reviews are completed within time periods established in RDS (reference paragraph
2.9.5). RPCOs will coordinate with RDS assigned supervisors to ensure prompt action is taken
on overaged workbaskets items. Once a save list is complete in RDS the RPCO will download
 46                                                          AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012


the spreadsheet and format it IAW download instructions provided on the AF Reclamation
SharePoint site at: https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/MC-LG-02-
63/AF%20Reclamation/Forms/AllItems.aspx (References Folder).
          8.9.2.2.2. A RDS generated save list will be the primary starting point for
          determining overall engine reclamation requirements. Once finalized in RDS, engine
          SOS personnel will analyze reclamation candidates further to determine if time
          remaining on parts (when applicable) or other applicable factors justifies reclamation
          action. Additions, changes, and deletions to each RDS generated save list are
          authorized by SOS IM/ES personnel. The TMS Reclamation Lead is responsible for
          establishing a finalized list of items to be removed from specific engines assigned to
          each project. This must be accomplished NLT 30 days after requirements are
          finalized in RDS (NLT 60 days after RDS project initiation). Once finalized by the
          TMS Reclamation lead, a save list is the authorized document used to identify engine
          reclamation project requirements.
          8.9.2.2.3. After reclamation requirements are finalized conduct an analysis to
          determine if costs associated with executing the project, compared to the value of
          parts potentially reclaimed, justify executing the project. Factors include but are not
          limited to:
              8.9.2.2.3.1. Costs to prepare and transport engines to reclamation site (coordinate
              with AFLCMC).
              8.9.2.2.3.2. Costs associated with obtaining authorized containers to store parts
              reclaimed from whole engines.
              8.9.2.2.3.3. Estimated labor costs and availability of stands, dollies, adapters,
              special tools, and equipment.
              8.9.2.2.3.4. Facilities availability/constraints at all potential reclamation sites.
              8.9.2.2.3.5. Fill critical parts shortages.
       8.9.2.3. Once a save list is finalized and funding secured to support parts removals, the
       TMS Reclamation Lead will initiate a temporary job order (organic workload) or an over
       and above (contract) to authorize the removal and shipment of items to the addresses
       listed on each save list. RDS now has the capability to produce downloadable save lists
       on to spreadsheets. The use of AFMC Form 111, Reclamation Save List previously used
       to support non-programmed engine reclamation is no longer required.
          8.9.2.3.1. The TMS Reclamation Lead must also instruct each reclamation
          maintenance site to provide the SOS and EIM a monthly listing by serial number for
          those engines disassembled and reclaimed parts shipped.          The reclamation
          maintenance activity SRAN Engine Manager will submit a loss transaction in CEMS
          removing the engine serial numbers from the USAF inventory per TO 00-25-254-1,
          CEMS Engine Configuration, Status and TCTO Reporting Procedures.
          8.9.2.3.2. Maintenance activities tasked with removing save list parts must be
          instructed by the TMS Reclamation Lead to provide an engine reclamation project
          summary report. Engine project summary reports must be submitted NLT 90 days
          after engine project reclamation activities is complete. They must be filed by the
AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                    47


          SOS for future reference and to provide an audit trail of actions taken. Summary
          report data may be used to provide planning factors for future projects and to assist in
          forecasting funding requirements.
          8.9.2.3.2.1. Engine reclamation project summary reports will include five areas, 1)
          Authorized Engine Serial Numbers; 2) Items Requested on Project; 3) Reclaimed
          Items Shipping Information; 4) Items Not Available; and 5) Funding Amount Used
          on Project. A sample format is maintained on the AF Reclamation SharePoint site at:
          https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/MC-LG-02-63/AF%20Reclamation/Forms/AllItems.aspx
          (Engine Reclamation Folder). Other report formats are acceptable as long as the data
          requirements listed in the sample are fulfilled.
8.10. Engine Reclamation Priority Projects (Sites other than AMARG).
   8.10.1. TMS Reclamation Leads and designated SOS representatives are authorized to
   initiate priority projects to reclaim urgent engine parts requirements. The TMS Reclamation
   Lead or designated SOS representative will utilize the AFMC Form 206, Temporary Work
   Request process to have parts reclaimed; and are responsible for ensuring the process is
   completed. AFMC Form 206’s will identify what parts need to be removed from each engine
   identified. Each request must contain disposition instructions for parts being reclaimed and
   the engine. SOS personnel initiating an AFMC Form 206 will also provide potential due-in
   information to component item managers. Item managers will document actions with
   applicable D200A computation files or related inventory management files. The TMS
   Reclamation lead or designated SOS representative will provide engine serial numbers to the
   assigned SRAN Engine Manager. Engine SRAN Managers will submit loss transaction in
   CEMS as required, to remove engine serial numbers from the USAF inventory.
      8.10.1.1. TMS Reclamation Leads will ensure files are maintained to provide an audit
      trail of actions taken. Records may also be used as a baseline for estimating future
      projects.
      8.10.1.2. Material Control processes outlined in AFMCI 21-130, Depot Maintenance
      Materiel Control, will be used to control movement of reclaimed parts within
      Maintenance.
8.11. Assignment of Engine Reclamation Project Numbers: The engine reclamation project
save list number assignment format is:

Table 8.1. Engine Reclamation Project Number Assignment
Positions 1 & 2              Position 3                   Numeric Series
RC                           E = Engine                   600-699.
(The prefix for every engine                              (Numbers are assigned
project is RC)                                            sequentially)
For example, a T0056015 engine reclamation project number would be constructed as
RCE-600; the next sequential project number assigned would be RCE-601.

                                          Chapter 9

                               END ITEM RECLAMATION

9.1. General Information Regarding End Item Reclamation:
   9.1.1. Reclamation of AF equipment and recoverable spares is commonly referred to as “end
   item reclamation”. This process is not used to reclaim aircraft or aircraft engines. End item
   reclamation applies to materiel in the following categories:
      9.1.1.1. Complete systems identified by standard system designators (SSD) such as
      missiles and radar sets.
      9.1.1.2. Complete items of equipment authorized under allowance standards (AS).
      9.1.1.3. Recoverable components and subassemblies stocked as spares.
      9.1.1.4. Miscellaneous items not covered by any other procedure.
9.2. End Item Reclamation Candidates: All DoD mission needs must be met and the item
must be excess to DoD needs before considering end item reclamation. The end item manager
determines when items are excess to DoD needs. Items condemned or beyond economical repair
are exceptions and may be reclaimed at any time.
9.3. Identity of Specific End Item Reclamation Candidates:
   9.3.1. The end item manager controlling the wholesale stocks of excess materiel identifies
   specific end items to be reclaimed. Usually, reclamation begins with the least preferred
   member of an Interchangeability and Substitutability (I&S) group and progresses upward by
   condition.
   9.3.2. Utilization of the complete end item or assembly for its original purpose is preferred
   to reclaiming its components. Reclamation of serviceable end items normally occurs only
   when available assets clearly exceed all potential future requirements. However, serviceable
   assets may be reclaimed if they cannot be substituted for the needed components and either
   of the following conditions exists:
      9.3.2.1. Current production sources or vendor stocks cannot provide required
      components.
      9.3.2.2. Recovery of parts in advance of new procurement can satisfy outstanding
      requirements on MILSTRIP priorities 01-08.
   9.3.3. When reclaiming an end item or recoverable spare to meet requirements of either
   paragraphs 10.3.1 or 2, the total number of assets reclaimed is limited to a number necessary
   to provide the quantity of critical components required.
9.4. Missile Reclamation/Deactivation:
   9.4.1. Weapon systems loaded in the D200F, Applications, Programs, and Indentures
   Business System will utilize automated save list processes available through D035G
   Reutilization/Disposition System (RDS) to generate save lists for AF managed items. Non-
   programmed reclamation procedures will be used for actions performed away from AMARG.
   Units performing reclamation will follow tracking and return instructions provided by
AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                   49


   SPM/SSM personnel. SPM/SSM personnel will utilize the parts tracking and return
   instruction letter template located on the Reclamation Community of Practice link below.
   Missile support activities planning to reclaim cataloged parts which are over and above items
   identified through RDS must coordinate reclamation actions with appropriate item
   management and equipment specialist personnel prior. Item managers must approve all
   reclamation actions and provide shipment directions to reclaiming activities. SharePoint link:
   9.4.2. Reclamation of cataloged items not managed by Air Force inventory functions will
   have to be coordinated with each responsible SOS. Each SOS must approve reclamation
   actions and provide shipment direction to reclaiming activities.
   9.4.3. Units or SPM/SSM personnel proposing to reclaim items that have no national stock
   numbers assigned must work such actions on a case-by-case basis. Field level units must
   coordinate all actions through their respective SPM/SSM. Non-cataloged items must have
   NSNs assigned. Weapon system equipment specialists will have to initiate cataloging action
   on each item. Afterwards, coordination with item management personnel will be required to
   ensure inventory levels are established to support reclamation actions, and retention of the
   items. Each SOS will need to provide reclaiming activities shipment directions once all
   coordination actions have been completed, so items can be returned to the appropriate supply
   activity and tracked on accountable records.
9.5. Reclamation Candidates Identified During Excess Review:
   9.5.1. Items declared excess during excess reviews will be considered for end item
   reclamation.
   9.5.2. End item managers are responsible for determining if requirements exist for
   indentured parts contained in end items during excess reviews.
   9.5.3. End item managers will coordinate with applicable equipment specialist (ES) using
   RDS to determine if requirements exist for indentured parts contained in end items and
   decide if reclamation actions are feasible. (End item managers will annotate comments with
   request for ES to review if any indentured parts are needed for end item reclamation in RDS.)
   For example, some parts may not be designed for re-use.
   9.5.4. If the ES determines end item reclamation is not feasible, the ES must provide end
   item manager a brief explanation why in the comments and continue with recommended
   disposal action in RDS.
   9.5.5. If the ES determines end item reclamation is feasible, no disposal action should be
   taken, and the ES should annotate this in their RDS comments (ES should disapprove
   disposal action and indicate end item reclamation is feasible). The end item manager will
   place end item in condition code P status and will not recommend disposal in RDS if they
   agree with ES comments. The end item manager/Production Management Specialist (PMS)
   will initiate the AFMC Form 206, Temporary Work Request process to have indentured parts
   reclaimed. The end item manager is responsible for ensuring AFMC Form 206 process is
   completed. Placing end items in condition code P status will remove items from the asset
   posture in RDS Excess review where only A through H condition codes are allowed.
   9.5.6. AFMC Form 206 will identify what indentured parts need to be removed from the end
   item. End item manager will provide disposition instructions on AFMC Form 206 for parts
 50                                                        AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012


   being reclaimed and end item once completed. The end item manager will provide potential
   due-in information to component item managers. End item managers will document actions
   with applicable D200A computation files or related inventory management files.
   9.5.7. Materiel Control processes outlined in AFMCI 21-130, Depot Maintenance Materiel
   Control, will be used to control movement of reclaimed parts within maintenance.
9.6. Determining the Appropriate Maintenance Priority for End Item Reclamation: The
actual recovery of components must be accomplished as a depot maintenance priority workload
if assets can be used to offset either a current year buy requirement (R1) or current year repair
requirement (R2). Long-range support requirements are satisfied through routine actions.
9.7. End Item Reclamation Program Assessment: End item manager supervisors will ensure
reclamation processes are followed prior to sending items to disposal.
AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                     51


                                          Chapter 10

                AMARG STORAGE ACCOUNT ASSET MANAGEMENT

10.1. Purpose of the AMARG Storage Account: The AMARG Storage Account contains
parts removed from specific serial numbered aircraft in storage at AMARG. Parts are packaged
and stored in the AMARG supply warehouse system. Items inventoried within this account are
considered part of the aircraft from which they were removed and are not visible in any DoD
asset reporting system.
10.2. Storage Asset Relationship to AMARG Stored Aircraft:
   10.2.1. All AMARG storage account parts remain obligated to the particular aircraft serial
   number from which they were removed.
   10.2.2. If AMARG receives a request for priority removal of an NSN with a positive balance
   in the storage account, the removal will be referred to the storage account for processing. If
   the stored parts are obligated to aircraft tail numbers different from the SPM/SSM approved
   tail numbers on the priority removal request, the part must not be shipped to satisfy the
   removal request without written approval from the SPM/SSM. Storage account assets must
   not be reassigned to other aircraft without SPM/SSM approval.
10.3. Types of Parts held in the Storage Account:
   10.3.1. The following paragraphs identify some of the most common circumstances that
   generate turn-ins to the AMARG storage account.
   10.3.2. Most items held in the Storage Account are removed from aircraft during the time
   they are processed into storage. These removals include classified items, highly pilferable
   items, life support kits containing drugs or explosives and shelf life or other items subject to
   deterioration in the extreme desert heat.
   10.3.3. Some items not required for safety of flight may be shipped separately to follow an
   aircraft flown to AMARG for storage.
   10.3.4. Some items in this storage account are the result of the priority reclamation of
   another part from a stored aircraft. If parts must be removed from an aircraft in order to
   access a priority reclamation part and it is impossible or impractical to reinstall them,
   AMARG may elect to account for them in the storage account, warehoused for better
   resource protection.
10.4. Retention, Reporting, Issuing, Shipping and Disposal of Storage Account Assets:
   10.4.1. The management of these individual parts follows the same general principles that
   apply to the aircraft to which they are obligated.
   10.4.2. Storage account assets obligated to XS or XT coded aircraft are identified as
   inviolate and are held without requests for disposition instructions. They are reported for
   disposition instructions when the aircraft to which they are obligated is no longer assigned to
   inviolate storage status. Assets obligated to aircraft belonging to NMUSAF, Smithsonian,
   foreign governments, or other special programs are exempt and must be excluded from
   reporting.
 52                                                       AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012


   10.4.3. Assets obligated to aircraft scheduled for either flight withdrawal or overland
   shipment from AMARG, are not reported for disposition. The parts are issued, as required,
   to the AMARG maintenance shops for reinstallation, or are packaged for shipment with the
   aircraft. When aircraft depart AMARG, any residual NSNs remaining in the storage account
   obligated to the departed aircraft must be reported for disposition.
   10.4.4. Assets obligated to XV, XX, XD, RIT, reclamation or disposal aircraft are authorized
   for disposition reporting and disposition directing return to the wholesale inventory,
   redistribution, or disposal. NSNs held in the storage account with Fxx series SOS codes,
   assigned to aircraft that have completed the save list process, and have been authorized for
   aircraft disposal will be turned-in for disposal. If Fxx series SOS code items need to be
   reclaimed they will be under save list processes.
10.5. AMARG Stored Asset Disposition Report: On a quarterly basis (in Oct, Jan, Apr and
Jul), AMARG must report eligible parts to responsible SOS representatives (i.e. item managers,
DLA inventory management personnel) for disposition instructions. Lead AFGLSC RPCOs will
assist in coordinating actions between AMARG on NSNs assigned to IMs at their base. This
report is assigned Reports Control Symbol LOG-MM- (Q)-7210, Request for Disposition
Instructions for Assets Removed from AMARG Stored Aircraft (Refer to Chapter 11). The
AMARG disposition report will contain the following information:
   10.5.1. Routing Identifier Code.
   10.5.2. Manager Designator Code.
   10.5.3. National stock number (NSN, ND or K) or part number when no NSN is assigned.
   Part numbered items will also have the federal supply code for manufacturers (FSCM),
   applicable aircraft and technical order reference, when available, to assist in further
   identifying the item and determining appropriate disposition.
   10.5.4. Nomenclature.
   10.5.5. Quantity available for disposition.
   10.5.6. Supply condition code.
   10.5.7. Expendability, reparability, recoverability category (ERRC) code.
   10.5.8. Unit cost.
   10.5.9. Extended cost.
   10.5.10. Identity of the aircraft from which the part was removed.
   10.5.11. IM/SOS disposition instructions.
   10.5.12. Budget Code. Note: Additional fields may be added based on data availability
   when approved by 401 SCMS/GUMC and AMARGAMARG/OBW.
10.6. Preparation of the RCS: LOG-MM-(Q)-7210 Request for Disposition Report:
   10.6.1. AMARG prepares an electronic spreadsheet format in Routing Identifier Code (RIC),
   Manager Designator Code (MDC) and NSN sequence.
   10.6.2. AMARG must transmit each quarterly report along with instructions no later than the
   seventh workday of each new reporting period.
AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                    53


10.7. Disposition Instructions:
   10.7.1. SOS representatives must provide disposition instructions for each item reported
   using the electronic spreadsheet provided by AMARG.
   10.7.2. AMARG must be directed to either ship the items or transfer them to DLA
   Disposition Services.
   10.7.3. For shipments, SOS must provide the “ship to” SRAN and specify the priority.
   10.7.4. If disposition on an item is to transfer it to DLA Disposition Services, the annotation
   must be “Disposal Authorized.”
       10.7.4.1. The SOS must return the report by the established suspense date.
   10.7.5. Within 30 days of receipt of the disposition instructions, AMARG must ship or
   transfer as directed by each SOS. AMARG must ensure actions from each quarterly
   reporting cycle are completed prior to initiating the next scheduled quarterly report.
10.8. DoD Materiel Returns Program Exemption: The storage account assets are not subject
to reporting in the DoD Material Returns Program. The wholesale system does not issue
AMARG financial credit for materiel shipped from this account. Refer to AFMAN 23-110,
Volume 3, Part 1, Chapter 9.
10.9. Disposition of Items Not Managed by the AF or DLA:
   10.9.1. The items must be reported to the appropriate SOS for disposition by AMARG If the
   NSNs are managed by another service.
   10.9.2. AMARG will coordinate with SPM/SSM logistics personnel prior to disposal of
   parts associated with active weapon systems to ensure no future requirements are anticipated
   if the NSN has a JXX series routing identifier or is a non-cataloged item.
10.10. Supply Condition Codes for Storage Account Materiel: Storage account materiel is
stored in condition code R in most cases. The true condition of the property is unknown and
funding for inspection and condition code determination is not automatically provided to
AMARG by any customer. If it is necessary the IM know the condition code in order to
determine appropriate disposition instructions, SOS directs AMARG/OBW to request an
inspection, and provide technical inspection criteria. If AMARG has the capability to perform
the inspection, the IM must arrange for necessary funding of this workload. The disposition
report must be annotated to advise AMARG the item may be subject to further inspection at
AMARG and will be changed to another condition code upon completion of the inspection
process. Disposition instructions must be provided to address both serviceable and unserviceable
items generated from the AMARG inspection and testing.
10.11. Shelf Life Coded Materiel: Shelf life items will be removed from aircraft and turned
into to supply IAW AFI 16-402. SPM/SSM must negotiate agreements with AMARG/OB if
they require AMARG to store shelf life items for aircraft in any storage category.
10.12. AMARG SNUD Reconciliation Responsibility: AMARG must accomplish semi-
annual SNUD reconciliation actions to maintain data integrity for NSNs maintained in it. Stock
number data elements must be correct so items can be reported to the appropriate IM for
disposition instructions.
 54                                                       AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012


10.13. Alternative AMARG Storage Account Procedures: AMARG and 401 SCMS/GUMC
will explore the use of other processes to report and re-distribute storage account assets. Local
procedures will be developed, as required, and incorporated into AFMCI 23-111 revision.
AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                    55

                                    STORAGE REPORTS

11.1. Reclamation Reports: The AF Reclamation Program must develop methods to analyze
and measure performance in order to ensure it is generating maximum benefits for the AF.
Queries utilizing data from AF sources and AMARG Business Systems will be generated for
analysis purposes. Information will be used to assess program performance and develop process
improvements.
11.2. Aircraft and Missile Status and Activity Report: This report is generated by AMARG
on a monthly basis. It depicts the AMARG aircraft/missile inventory and their project code
designations. The report assists IMs in determining the availability of aircraft/engines that may
potentially satisfy reclamation requirements. This report is posted to the AF Portal, Reclamation
Community of Practice site on a monthly basis. Control number RCS: LOG-MM (M) 7148
applies.
11.3. Save List Project Summary Report:
   11.3.1. This AMARG generated monthly report will be prepared for each programmed
   reclamation project in “parts removal status” at AMARG. Control numbers RCS: LOG-MM
   (M)8603, Part 1 (Monthly activity) and Part 2 (Completion Summary of All Activity) apply.
   It will be transmitted to 401 SCMS electronically, in spreadsheet format. 401 SCMS will
   post it to the Reclamation of AF Community of Practice. Alternate distribution methods may
   be approved by 401 SCMS in coordination with AMARG/OBW when more efficient means
   are identified.
   11.3.2. Part 1, AMARG Save List Project Monthly Activity Report: This report is generated
   on a monthly basis, by project number and recaps all turn-in and shipment activity for the
   previous month. It also reflects NSN code out actions which explain why the save list will
   not generate certain parts, material condition code for parts shipped, and tracks the dollar
   value of parts shipped each month.
   11.3.3. Part 2, AMARG Completed Save List Project Summary: Lists each completed save
   list by project number. This report summarizes parts reclamation activity by NSN, dollar
   value, and material condition code of all items returned. It must also include total work
   authority expended.
11.4. Data for Engines Installed on Excess Aircraft: The AMARG EM generates this report
when aircraft are initially assigned to reclamation projects. All engines installed on reclamation
project aircraft are reported to the appropriate EIM at OC-ALC for disposition instructions.
Refer to Chapter 8 for additional information. Control number RCS: LOG-MM (AR) 7759
applies.
11.5. AMARG Storage Account Asset Report: Lists assets removed from AMARG stored
aircraft. AMARG must generate this report on a quarterly basis. Control number RCS: LOG-
MM (Q)7210 applies.
 56                                                        AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012


                                          Chapter 12

  AIR FORCE SPECIAL DEFENSE PROPERTY DISPOSAL ACCOUNT (AFSDPDA)

12.1. AFSDPDA: AFSDPDA (FR2373) account controls excess military aircraft held for
reclamation and disposal preparation. The account maintains control of the excess aircraft from
the time the services declare aircraft excess to their requirements until they have been reclaimed
and are officially transferred to the DLA Disposition Service or to an authorized recipient.
Reference AFI 24-230, Maintaining Air Force DoD Activity Address Codes (DODAAC), Table
2.1 and DoD 4160.21-M.
12.2. AF Storage Project Codes for Excess Aircraft:
   12.2.1. AMARG AVDO records the storage project assignment in the AMARG MAXIMO
   inventory control system. At that point in time, the FR2373 AFSDPDA assumes control of
   the aircraft until they complete reclamation and are either transferred to an authorized
   recipient or are turned in to DLA Disposition Services on an official DD Form 1348-1A,
   Issue Release/Receipt Document Disposal Turn-In Document (DTID).
       12.2.1.1. Aircraft will remain in AF Reliability and Maintainability Information System
       (REMIS) records in accordance with final termination accountability processes outlined
       in AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status and Utilization Reporting procedures.
       12.2.1.2. AF Form 913 instructions direct STX project aircraft be reclaimed and then
       assigned to Reclamation Insurance Type (RIT) status.
       12.2.1.3. AF Form 913 instructions direct STD project aircraft be reclaimed and then
       processed for disposal.
       12.2.1.4. When RIT aircraft are authorized for disposal, the SPM/SMM must coordinate
       with AF/A8PB to issue an AF Form 913 transferring the aircraft to an STD project code.
       AMARG can then post the storage project change to the MAXIMO system and proceed
       with disposal processing.
12.3. FR2373 Aircraft Inventory: AMARG must maintain appropriate control records for all
aircraft assigned to FR2373 and insure that a 100% physical inventory, by aircraft serial number,
is accomplished on an annual basis and certified by the account manager. Discrepancies must be
researched and resolved in a timely manner and corrective actions must be reviewed and
approved by AMARG/OBW.
12.4. GSA Excess Aircraft Screening:
   12.4.1. When AF/A8PB authorizes disposal of excess aircraft that have completed
   programmed reclamation or have RPM approved reclamation waivers, AMARG/OBW must
   verify that the programmed reclamation is complete or have approved waiver before
   initiating GSA excess aircraft screening process required by DoD 4160.21-M. This
   screening process offers aircraft to civilian federal agencies and authorized donees as
   specified in DOD 4160.21-M.
   12.4.2. The screening process is automated and utilizes the GSAXCESS.gov web site. Each
   disposal aircraft offered for screening is assigned an FR2373 control number consisting of
   the FR2373 DODAAC, the 4 digit Julian date the screening cycle is initiated and an
AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                   57


   AMARG assigned 4 digit local identifier code. The screening period runs for approximately
   60 calendar days. AMARG/OBW must retain an official file copy of each completed aircraft
   screening action.
   12.4.3. Reclamation of parts from aircraft undergoing GSA utilization screening are limited
   to Category A, Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP) priorities
   01 through 08 requirements which cannot be satisfied from other eligible aircraft. The
   AFSDPDA must advise GSA when a major component requires supporting a Category A
   requirement is requested from property undergoing GSA screening action. Any other lower
   priority reclamation requirements must be delayed to determine if any authorized recipients
   select the aircraft during screening. If GSA advises that aircraft in the screening cycle will
   be donated for flight purposes, reclamation requirements will be waived.
   12.4.4. If authorized recipients select aircraft offered in the GSA screening cycle, they must
   coordinate with AMARG/OBW to negotiate any required assistance from AMARG, obtain
   cost estimates and arrange for funding, if required, to prepare the aircraft for transfer.
   Aircraft transfers/donations must be documented on DD 1149s or DD 1348-1s and a copy of
   each completed document must be retained in the AMARG/OBW FR2373 aircraft serial
   number files and posted to the AF/A8PB Strike Board CoP.
   12.4.5. Screening Report Files: An individual file must be established for each GSA Report
   of Excess Personal Property submitted to the GSA excess reporting web site. Each file must
   be identified by the complete report number. The file must contain a copy of all
   correspondence to and from GSA or potential recipients relative to the reported aircraft. The
   original of each shipping/transfer document must be maintained in the AFSDPDA file.
12.5. Demilitarization:
   12.5.1. DOD 4160.21-M-1 establishes the procedures, identifies the categories of property
   and key points requiring demilitarization, and provides guidance regarding the method and
   degree of demilitarization required.
   12.5.2. AMARG must receive demilitarization instructions for each MDS aircraft
   programmed for disposal. SPM/SSMs must furnish AMARG technical guidance and
   assistance, as required.   Combat aircraft are generally disposed of by DLA contracted
   shredding which is witnessed and certified by DLA Disposition Services personnel.
   12.5.3. DD Form 1348-1A, DTID prepared by FR2373 AFSDPDA for transfer of aircraft
   accountability must be signed by the AMARG Disposal Flight Chief and must certify that all
   required demilitarization has been accomplished. The document must also contain a
   "Radiation Certification Statement" and document removal of hazardous materials.
 58                                                    AFMCI23-111 9 FEBRUARY 2012



12.6. Cost Reimbursement Considerations for Donated/Sold Aircraft: Recipients must be
advised due to safety reasons and facility concerns AMARG personnel will generally be
responsible for the removal of aircraft and equipment from the AMARG facility being donated
or sold. Deviations to these procedures may be authorized on a case-by-case basis by the
AMARG Commander. If AMARG is requested to and agrees to do work resulting from GSA
utilization screening, the requesting activity must reimburse all AMARG costs.

        PREPARATION OF PROGRAMMED RECLAMATION REQUISITIONS

A2.1. AFMC Form 110, Reclamation Requisition, is a single line item form used by an IM to
record wholesale supply system requirements for recovery of components from programmed
reclamation of aircraft reclaimed at AMARG. AMARG receives the consolidated batch of
AFMC Form 110s from the lead Center RPCO and prepares internal work control documents to
activate the programmed reclamation project save list.
