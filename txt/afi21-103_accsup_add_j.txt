This MESL compliments AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting. It
applies to all RC-135V/W ACC units, to include deployed locations. This Addendum does not apply to
Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve Command units and members. Ensure that all records created as
a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintain in accordance with Air Force Manual
(AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records
Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at:
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. Contact supporting records managers as
required. Send recommended changes or comments on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major
changes include: Mission columns have been changed. Numerous systems Work Unit Codes
(WUCs) have been added or deleted. Remarks are incorporated for each applicable WUC and
have replaced notes to better clarify mission capability requirements.

1. General. The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW AFI 21-103. MESLs lay the ground
work for reporting the status of aircraft availability. They list the minimum essential systems and
subsystems that must work on an aircraft for it to perform specifically assigned unit wartime,
training, test or other missions. MESLs are not comprehensive WUC lists and are not intended
to mirror Minimum Equipment Lists. Mission Ready Available (MRA) is used in readiness
Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) reporting only and denotes Mission Capable
(MC) aircraft capable of being configured for a contingency mission IAW COMACC
OMNIBUS Plan.
     1.1. Qualifying notes are used to define aircraft exceptions and help explain complex
     degraded mission systems.
     1.2. Aircraft status for generation and deployment: The goal is to generate or deploy Fully
     Mission Capable (FMC) aircraft, recognizing status actually achieved may be less than FMC.
     A Not Mission Capable (NMC) aircraft may be deployed provided it is safe for flight and can
     be configured and generated to MRA status at an employment site.
     1.3. All ACC units will generate, or deploy and regenerate, using ACC MESLs. Major
     Command differences in MESLs are acknowledged. Upon actual deployment to another
     MAJCOM theater, the gaining MAJCOM has the responsibility to resource and specify the
     unit's requirements and resource the differences in support/mission equipment.
     1.4. Reading the MESL. A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by WUC against
     the Full System List (FSL) and all applicable Basic Systems Lists (BSLs) across the page.
     Each unit's Design Operational Capability (DOC) statement determines applicability of BSL
     columns. The aircraft MESLs incorporate all ACC assigned aircraft and therefore it is
     important to compare only those columns listed in the MESL which are applicable to the
     unit's assigned aircraft. For example, units with CC (wartime) coded aircraft would
     determine and report status using only the FSL and BSL columns related to their DOC
     statement. Units with TF (training) coded aircraft would determine and report status using
     only the FSL and TNG columns , and units with CB (test) coded aircraft would determine
     and report status using only the FSL and TST columns. Units with multiple coded aircraft
     will ensure status is reported using the MESL columns appropriate to the individual aircraft
     assignment code.
