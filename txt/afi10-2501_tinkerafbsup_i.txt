This Instruction is consistent with Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 6055.17, DOD
Installation Emergency Management (EM) Program, Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 10-2,
Readiness; AFPD 10-25, Emergency Management; AFPD 10-26, Counter-Chemical, Biological,
Radiological, and Nuclear Operations; AFPD 10-8, Defense Support of Civil Authorities
(DSCA); Air Force Doctrine Document (AFDD) 3-40, Counter Chemical, Biological,
Radiological, and Nuclear Operations; and portions of AFDD 3-10, Force Protection. It also
aligns the Air Force with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5 (HSPD-5), the National
Incident Management System (NIMS), and the National Response Framework (NRF). This

instruction also implements the Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS) based on the
NIMS methodology and aligns Air Force Emergency Management (AFEM) planning and
response with the NRF as directed by HSPD-5. This instruction defines the Air Force EM
program as a cross-functional program that integrates procedures and standards for planning;
logistical requirements; emergency response actions; emergency response guidelines; exercises
and evaluations; personnel training; detection, identification, and warning; notification; and
enemy attack actions. It establishes responsibilities, procedures, and standards for Air Force
mitigation and emergency response to physical threats resulting from major accidents; natural
disasters; conventional attacks (including those using high-yield explosives); and terrorist use of
CBRN materials. Its prescribed planning process helps commanders achieve unity of effort,
allocate and use resources effectively, and identify shortfalls in their response capabilities. This
Instruction includes guidance for both Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the
Continental United States (OCONUS) locations and applies to Active Duty, Air Force Reserve,
and Air National Guard (ANG) units worldwide. See Attachment 1 for definitions of acronyms,
abbreviations, and terms used in this instruction. Consult cited policy directives, instructions,
manuals and their supplements for specific policies, procedures and requirements. Send

Emergency Management Program to include EMWG responsibilities in Chapter 2, Radiological
AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                                                        3


Response requirements in Chapter 3, the All-Hazards Risk Management Process in Chapter 4,
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Defense and Air Force Incident
Command System Position Based Training requirements, Tables 6.1., 6.2., 6.3., 6.4., Air Force
Incident Management System (AFIMS) Education and Training Requirements defined in
Chapter 6, and Air Force Emergency Management Exercise Requirements in Chapter 7. The
reader must use this IC in conjunction with the publication, IC-1, IC-2, and these changes take
precedence.


(TINKERAFB) This supplement is a complete rewrite to match the current Air Force
Instruction and MAJCOM Supplement. This supplement reorganizes the Corporate Readiness
Structure; removes duplication from the parent AFI; adds requirement for tornado shelters; and
clarifies EM Program responsibilities for the installation.

             AIR FORCE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (EM) PROGRAM

1.1. General Information. This instruction implements Air Force Doctrine Document (AFDD)
3-40, Counter Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Operations; Air Force Policy
Document (AFPD) 10-2, Readiness; AFPD 10-25, Full-Spectrum Threat Response (to be
renamed Emergency Management); AFPD 10-26, Counter-Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical
Operational Preparedness (to be renamed Counter-Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and
Nuclear Operations); AFPD 10-8, Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA); and portions of
AFDD 3-10, Force Protection. It also aligns the Air Force with Homeland Security Presidential
Directive 5 (HSPD-5), the National Incident Management System (NIMS), and the National
Response Plan (NRP). This instruction also implements the Air Force Incident Management
System (AFIMS) based on the NIMS methodology and aligns Air Force EM planning and
response with the NRP as directed by HSPD-5. The AFIMS provides scalable and flexible
response to organize field-level operations for a broad spectrum of emergencies. The EM
program addresses the impacts of major accidents, natural disasters, conventional attacks, and
terrorist attacks. Commanders can achieve unity of effort, use resources effectively, and identify
shortfalls using the AFIMS planning process and this instruction. AFIMS is defined in
Attachment 1.
1.2. Purpose. This instruction provides the staff and key agencies of higher headquarters,
installations, and unit commanders with the policies, guidance, structure, and roles and
responsibilities to prepare for, prevent, respond to, recover from, and mitigate threats to their
mission. This instruction also includes guidance to plan, conduct, and evaluate Air Force EM
exercises.
NOTE: For differentiation purposes, the terms "CBRN" and "CBRNE" are defined below and in
Attachment 1.
CBRN. Operations that include chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear materials, either
individually or in combination. Collectively known as weapons of mass destruction (WMD),
CBRN replaces "Nuclear, biological, or chemical (NBC)" when used in reference to
operations or incidents limited to WMD issues. Toxic Industrial Chemicals or Toxic Industrial
Materials (TIC/TIM) and Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) are considered part of the "C" in
"CBRN".
CBRNE. Operations or incidents involving chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and
high-yield explosives, or materials, either individually or in combination. "CBRNE" is used
whenever reference is not being made to "NBC-only" operations or incidents.
1.3. Mission. The primary missions of the Air Force EM program are to save lives; minimize
the loss or degradation of resources; and continue, sustain, and restore operational capability in
an all-hazards physical threat environment at Air Force installations worldwide. The ancillary
missions of the Air Force EM program are to support homeland defense and civil support
operations and to provide support to civil and host nation authorities IAW DOD directives and
through the appropriate Combatant Command (COCOM). The Air Force EM program addresses
the physical threats listed in paragraph 1.1, occurring either individually or in combination.
AFIMS phases of incident management include prevention, preparation, response, recovery, and
AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014                                                         9


mitigation. The Air Force EM program examines potential emergencies and disasters based on
the risks posed by likely hazards; develops and implements programs aimed toward reducing the
impact of these events on the installation; prepares for risks that cannot be eliminated; and
prescribes actions required to deal with consequences of actual events and to recover from those
events.
1.4. Program Policy. The Air Force will establish a single integrated EM program to mitigate
the effects of major accidents; natural disasters; conventional attacks (including those using high-
yield explosives); and terrorist use of CBRN materials on Air Force personnel, resources, and
operations. The Air Force EM program will develop and implement measures for, and manage
activities related to, emergency preparedness, incident management, passive defense (including
response and recovery operations) and consequence management. The Air Force Civil Engineer
(AF/A7C) is the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for the Air Force EM program. Chapter
3 lists responsibilities of organizations that manage other program elements. The Air Force EM
program is established IAW this instruction.
   1.4.1. When compliance with this publication is impractical due to unique local or
   MAJCOM situations, request a waiver from AF/A7CX. An approved waiver remains in
   effect until the approving official cancels it in writing or this instruction is revised. When the
   OPR revises this publication, the waiver requester must renew the waiver. Until a waiver is
   approved by AF/A7CX, the MAJCOM or installation must make every effort to comply with
   this publication. The instruction OPR must maintain a copy of all waiver requests with the
   instruction record set.
   1.4.2. MAJCOM and other agency supplements to this publication should be forwarded to
   HQ AFCESA/CEXR. Supplements cannot be less restrictive than the basic publication;
   however, if needed, they can be more restrictive. Waivers to supplemental guidance will be
   handled by the agency that developed the supplement.
1.5. Major Program Elements. Major program elements of the Air Force EM program include
warning and reporting, command and control (C2), planning, equipping, organizing, training,
exercising, evaluating, response operations and incident management.
1.6. Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Support.
   1.6.1. Each Air Force unit must participate in the AFEM program including exercises and
   meet the AFEM program requirements in this and other governing instructions. The host Air
   Force installation will provide support to all assigned, attached, and tenant units and
   agencies, including AFRC, ANG, DOD, Joint Bases (where the AF is the lead), and Non-
   DOD units, located on and off the installation. AFRC and ANG tenant units will be
   incorporated into the host installation’s Installation Emergency Management Plan (IEMP)
   10-2. The Readiness and Emergency Management (R&EM) Flight on the host installation is
   the Installation Commander’s Air Force EM program OPR and performs the functions of the
   Installation Office of Emergency Management. The R&EM Flight under the Base Civil
   Engineer (CE) is the only Office of Emergency Management on an installation. The EM
   program must address the objectives and program elements related to all-hazard threats.
   Installations with contracted R&EM Flights must ensure their contracts incorporate all the
   tasks in Table A3.3, and Table A4.12, and meet all requirements in this and other EM
   Program Guidance. R&EM Flights with civilian bargaining unit employees who are required
   to change workplace requirements and assume emergency response roles do require
 10                                  AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014


   bargaining. Bargained requirements are formalized by designating manpower positions with
   “emergency responder” codes and updated job descriptions.
   1.6.2. MAJCOMs will determine the host installation for each Geographically Separated
   Unit (GSU) and provide guidance to train and equip its units in compliance with the EM
   program. Guidance may include supplementing this instruction and will include conducting
   Staff Assistance Visits (SAV). Air Force units located on other services’ installations will
   integrate into the host service’s EM program or equivalent.
   1.6.3. Military resources may be used to help local authorities when necessary to save lives,
   prevent human suffering, or mitigate great property damage. See AFI 10-801, Defense
   Support of Civilian Authorities (DSCA).
   1.6.4. Commanders at foreign locations will follow Department of State (DOS), theater, and
   MAJCOM guidance when assisting local authorities. Commanders at United States territories
   and US possessions will follow Department of the Interior (DOI), theater, and MAJCOM
   guidance when assisting local authorities. MAJCOMs will coordinate with the DOI to
   determine appropriate response protocols at US territory and US possession locations. These
   response protocols will be published in supplements to this instruction. (Note: HQ Pacific
   Air Forces [PACAF] will determine which guidance applies to Alaska and Hawaii.)
   1.6.5. The Air Force, under DOD direction, supports the EM programs of Federal agencies,
   as specified in the NRP and interagency agreements.
   1.6.6. Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Compliance with the NIMS. The
   Air Force revised the Full Spectrum Threat Response (FSTR) organizational construct and
   nomenclature as the Air Force EM program to be consistent with the NIMS and the NRP
   without compromising Air Force operational missions or disrupting military command
   authority. The Air Force uses the same structure for peace or war, at domestic and foreign
   locations. (See note in paragraph 1.6.4) To implement this change, standard NIMS
   terminology has replaced Air Force-specific terms. See Table 1.1, List of Cross-Referenced
   Terms.

Table 1.1. (DELETED)
1.7. Relationship to the National Response Plan (NRP) and National Incident Management
System (NIMS). On February 28, 2003, the President issued HSPD-5, which directs the
Secretary of Homeland Security to develop and administer the NIMS. This system provides a
consistent, nationwide approach for Federal, State, and local governments to work effectively
and efficiently together to prepare for, prevent, respond to, recover from, and mitigate domestic
incidents, regardless of cause, size, or complexity.
   1.7.1. The NIMS uses a systems approach to integrate the best existing processes and
   methods into a unified national framework for incident management. This framework forms
   the basis for interoperability and compatibility that will subsequently enable a diverse set of
   public and private organizations to conduct well-integrated and effective incident
   management operations. The NIMS provides interoperability and compatibility among
   various preparedness agencies through a core set of concepts, principles, terminology, and
   technologies. This core set includes:
       1.7.1.1. The Incident Command System (ICS).
AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014                                                    11


     1.7.1.2. Multiagency Coordination System (MCS).
     1.7.1.3. Unified commands, as defined by the NRP and the NIMS rather than as defined
     by DOD.
     1.7.1.4. Training, qualifications, and certification.
     1.7.1.5. Resource identification and management, including systems for classifying types
     of resources.
     1.7.1.6. Incident information collecting, tracking, and reporting.
     1.7.1.7. Incident resources collecting, tracking, and reporting.
  1.7.2. The Air Force uses the NRP structure to implement the AFIMS. The NRP was
  developed to establish a comprehensive, national, all-hazards approach to incident
  management across a spectrum of activities. The NRP outlines how the Federal government
  implements the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as
  amended, (usually referred to as the Stafford Act) to assist State, local, and tribal
  governments when a major disaster or emergency overwhelms their ability to save lives;
  protect public health, safety, and property and restore their communities. The NRP and its
  resultant organizational structure are used by the Air Force to integrate its incident response
  with civilian responses. In addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
  developed the NIMS Implementation Template for use by Federal departments and agencies
  to help them incorporate the NIMS into their emergency response plans, procedures, and
  policies. The template is available on the FEMA web site.
  1.7.3. The NRP requires an ICS designed to enable effective and efficient domestic incident
  management by integrating a combination of facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures,
  and communications operating within a common organizational structure. ICS is used at all
  levels of government—Federal, State, local, and tribal—as well as by many private-sector
  organizations.
     1.7.3.1. The ICS is one of two methods used to provide a common operating picture
     (COP). The ICS provides the communications, intelligence sharing and information
     sharing for incident management. The COP provides the framework necessary to:
         1.7.3.1.1. Formulate and disseminate indications and warnings.
         1.7.3.1.2. Formulate, execute, and communicate operational decisions at an incident
         site, as well as between incident management entities across jurisdictions and
         functional agencies.
         1.7.3.1.3. Prepare for potential requirements and request support for incident
         management activities.
         1.7.3.1.4. Develop and maintain overall awareness and understanding of an incident
         within and across jurisdictions.
     1.7.3.2. Information management is the second of the two methods used to provide a
     COP. In addition, the Air Force GeoBase Program provides situational awareness,
     supports C2, provides the capability to develop plumes and cordons, places information
     on a map that can be displayed and provides a tool kit that supports emergency response.

                                          Chapter 2

      AIR FORCE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (EM) PROGRAM STRUCTURE

2.1. Purpose. This chapter discusses the organization of the Air Force EM program at all levels
of command. The Air Force EM program structure establishes a clear progression of
coordination and communication from installation level to MAJCOM level to Air Force level.
See Figure 2.1, Air Force Emergency Management Program. This structure has the following
two elements at each command level:
   2.1.1. A strategic planning and management staff to maintain an EM program.
   2.1.2. A tactical response structure to manage or conduct contingency response operations.

Figure 2.1. Air Force Emergency Management Program.
AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014                                                  13


2.2. Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Structure. The Air Force EM
program structure includes a strategic planning and management staff and a tactical response
element.
   2.2.1. The Air Force (AF) level will establish and chair a HAF-level working group to
   synchronize AFEM policy and programs. The EM planning and management structure is
   supported by and supports various cross-functional councils, steering groups, and working
   groups that discuss interrelated C-CBRN, force protection, anti-terrorism, medical issues.
   These working groups must synchronize AFEM policy and programs with focus on
   education, training, exercises, and modernization.

       2.2.1.3. (DELETED)
   2.2.2. In support of Air Force operations and as the Air Force lead for Agile Combat Support
   (ACS), the Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics, Installations, and Mission Support (AF/A4/7)
   provides policy direction and oversight of the Air Force disaster response force (DRF)
   capabilities for response, recovery, and sustainment of operations. When directed, the Air
   Staff will assist installations through the Air Force Operations Center (AFOC) to provide
   guidance and supplemental resources for any incident involving Air Force resources. The
   AFOC is the Air Force 24-hour point of contact for EM and Defense Support of Civil
   Authorities (DSCA) operations. See AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting, for AFOC and
   MAJCOM Operations Centers contact information.
2.3. Major Command (MAJCOM) Emergency Management (EM) Program
Structure. MAJCOMs will establish or integrate into existing corporate structures an
Emergency Management Working Group (EMWG). The MAJCOM EMWG is the primary
working group supporting the EM program through the development of MAJCOM guidance and
strategic plans. These working groups must synchronize AFEM policy and programs similar to
the HAF corporate structure.
   2.3.1. The MAJCOM EMWG addresses MAJCOM-wide cross-functional issues that affect
   the readiness and capabilities of the MAJCOM and address peacetime major accidents,
   natural disasters, and wartime conventional, terrorist, and CBRNE attacks. If not combined
   with another working group, the MAJCOM/A7C (Civil Engineer) chairs the MAJCOM
   EMWG. The EMWG meets at least semi-annually. The EMWG reviews EM training;
   monitors issues; monitors installation’s EM operational plans and exercises; reviews
   readiness issues according to AFPDs 10-2 and AFPD 10-4, Operations Planning: Air and
   Space Expeditionary Force (AEF); reviews SAV, exercise and Inspector General (IG) trends;
   monitors CBRNE defense equipment; coordinates shortfalls; coordinates TTPs and

   2.3.2. At MAJCOM level, the response elements includes the MAJCOM Command Center,
   Installation Command and Control, EOC, and specialized teams such as the MAJCOM
   Response Task Forces (RTF). MAJCOMs activate their Commander’s Senior Staff when
   requested by Air Staff or the MAJCOM commander. The MAJCOM Commander’s Senior
   Staff assists the Air Staff or installations in response efforts.
2.4. Installation Emergency Management (EM) Program Structure. Installation will
establish or integrate into existing corporate structures an Emergency Management Working
Group (EMWG). The EMWG must synchronize AFEM policy and programs into the installation
corporate structure. The EMWG ensures installation implementation of EM and C-CBRN related
concepts, training, and guidance passed from the MAJCOM. Programs and activities involving
EM and incident response, must participate fully with the EMWG.
   2.4.1. The Installation EMWG is chaired by the Mission Support Group (MSG)
   Commander. The chairperson appoints members and establishes working subgroups. The
   EMWG meets quarterly unless the chairperson requires meetings more frequently.

       2.4.1.1. The EMWG coordinates with the EET to review EM program training status;
       schedule and design EM exercises; monitor IEMP 10-2 updates; monitor mutual aid
       agreement (MAA) updates; review SAV and exercise trends; monitor AFIMS and CBRN
       defense equipment shortfalls and overages; coordinate new AFIMS TTP and initiatives;
       review the installation augmentation program according to AFPAM 10-243,
       Augmentation Duty; and facilitate computer-based training equipment for the base
       populace.
       2.4.1.2. The EMWG reviews installation-wide programs for the ability to achieve EM
       program objectives. This structure needs to incorporate local, state, and federal planning
       committees, councils, or groups. Examples include Environmental Protection Agency’s
       Local Emergency Planning Committee, FEMA’s Emergency Management Council, State
       Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), local Emergency Management offices, and so
       forth. Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) the DOS, theater Commander of
       the Combatant Command, and host nation agreements may provide additional
       requirements for the EMWG. The EMWG may have subordinate groups work on specific
       issues or planning tasks. As a minimum, the EMWG will have a subgroup: the All
       Hazards Response Planning Team.
           2.4.1.2.1. The purpose of the All Hazards Response Planning Team is to develop and
           refine installation response protocols to develop the IEMP 10-2 for responding to All-
           Hazard incidents. This team is responsible for accomplishing the assessments
           according to the risk management process defined in Chapter 4.
AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014                                                 17


        2.4.1.2.2. The R&EM Flight Chief or Superintendent chairs the All Hazards
        Response Planning Team. This team will meet as necessary or as tasked.
        2.4.1.2.2. (TINKERAFB) The All Hazards Response Planning Team will meet
        semi-annually.
     2.4.1.3. The EMWG will determine which specialized teams are required to support the
     installation EM program and what each team’s composition will be. Representatives from
     civilian agencies may be invited to discuss functional issues.
     2.4.1.4. The EMWG will use Table 2.3, for suggested EMWG topics. Subject matter
     may be modified to meet installation requirements. Furthermore, the EMWG will:
        2.4.1.4.1. Determine the scope of the installation EM program, utilizing scoping
        factors such as unit’s size, mission, IEMP 10-2 responsibilities and roles, and Unit
        Type Code (UTC) taskings.
        2.4.1.4.2. Determine installation response capability requirements (size and
        composition) for Emergency Management Support Team (EMST), Shelter
        Management Team (SMT), Contamination Control Team (CCT), Post-Attack
        Reconnaissance (PAR) and other specialized teams.
        2.4.1.4.3. Ensure information, briefings, and reports are received from MAJCOM
        EMWG, installation TWG, installation EET, and other tasked integrated process
        teams.
        2.4.1.4.4. Review unit SAV reports, CBRN equipment status, and status of
        installation readiness training before the EMWG meeting.
        2.4.1.4.5. Review annual Individual Protective Equipment (IPE) budget.
        2.4.1.4.6. Ensure accuracy, compliance,       and   timeliness   of Readiness     and
        Contingency capabilities briefings.
        2.4.1.4.7. Brief installation commander on EMWG results. Elevate EM or CBRN
        related issues to the installation commander when additional guidance or resolution is
        beyond the scope of the EMWG.

2.5. Installation Disaster Response Force (DRF) Structure.
   2.5.1. The DRF is the structure for response operations at the installation level. The DRF
   includes the CAT, CP, Emergency Communications Center (ECC), EOC, IC, First
   Responders (see paragraph 2.5.8), Emergency Responders (see paragraph 2.5.9), Unit
   Control Centers (UCC), Emergency Support Functions (ESFs), specialized teams, the
   Recovery Operations Chief, and Senior Military Representatives. These terms are defined in
   Attachment 1.
   2.5.2. Crisis Action Team (CAT). The CAT is a C2 function normally activated for a
   specific incident to oversee the mission operation of the installation. The CAT is an
   organization capable of devoting full-time attention to how the crisis affects mission
   execution and is composed of pre-designated personnel with possible representation from
   outside agencies as needed. The CAT develops courses of action and executes the
   commander's and HHQ’s directives. The composition and function of the CAT is largely
   mission driven and therefore a MAJCOM/DRU or installation commander prerogative.
      2.5.2.1. The CAT directs strategic actions supporting the installation's mission. The CP
      is separate from the CAT, which functions as the essential C2 node. The CAT is activated
      to provide command, control, and communication link to higher headquarters and
      comparable civilian agencies, and coordinates the incident response. The CAT is also
      activated for specific incidents to command, control, and coordinate required support, or
      at the discretion of senior wing leadership.
      2.5.2.2. The composition of a CAT varies according to the situation. Contingency
      situations do not always require response by the entire staff. Therefore, CAT operations
      should be composed of representatives from functional areas that will be needed in a
      major emergency or contingency operation. The size and composition of the CAT is also
      dependent upon the organizational and functional role of the unit.
      2.5.2.3. Membership of the CAT is most often a comprised by a combination of the
      commander’s senior staff (generally Group Commanders), tenant wing commanders (if
      any) and Special Staff members, and is scalable to support the Installation Commander’s
      requirements. During extended operations, CAT planning functions transition to the
      normal planning sections (current operations, future operations, and future plans).
 20                                  AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014


       2.5.2.4. The CAT Director: manages activities that affect the unit's resources that could
       affect the unit's mission; directs required actions contained in unit support plans and
       levels of support to the Incident Commander through the EOC Director during
       contingency operations based on mission needs, acceptable levels of risk, and
       commander’s intent; ensures accomplishment of all tasked missions according to the
       commander’s intent and the appropriate degree of readiness of subordinate units;
       monitors the status of assigned aircraft, aircraft launches and recoveries, and unit
       deployment operations through the deployment control center;             ensures timely
       submission of required operations and situation reports through the CP; and performs
       additional actions as directed by the commander.
           2.5.2.4.1. CAT Support Staff. The CAT Director shall appoint a CAT Manager with
           a support staff dedicated cadre (when activated) whose duties are administrative in
           nature. The support staff is normally a compilation of knowledge operations
           personnel designated by units across the installation to serve in this capacity during
           24/7 operations or when directed by the installation commander. CAT Support Staff
           duties are defined in Table 2.4, include, but are not limited to:

Table 2.4. CAT Support Staff Duties
Providing dedicated CAT data, information, and knowledge management services to the CAT.
Providing user assistance for common software applications (e.g. Microsoft Office Word, Power
Point, Excel, etc.).
Organizing an overall information management plan (IMP) for the commander. The IMP should
address:
   - Business rules for life-cycle management of information.
   - Processes for receiving, processing, and distributing CAT directives to the C2 nodes and the
     installation.
   - Activity log and suspense management.
   - Information disseminating methods and procedures (e.g., portals, web sites, shared drives,
     etc.)
   - Support for briefings and phone/e-mail listings.
   - Providing contact rosters of all CAT Support Staff personnel to the CP Controllers.
   2.5.3. The ECC includes a central dispatch capability or its interim equivalent for the
   installation. It should include the core functions of Fire Alarm Communications Center
   (FACC), Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC), and medical dispatch (where applicable).
   The ECC may be virtual until a central facility can be established. The central dispatch
   capability is a goal that installations must work towards while using current assets. In the
   interim virtually consolidated configurations are considered compliant with this guidance
   until the central dispatch capability is achieved. Existing resources should be used as backup
   capabilities once physical consolidation occurs.
   2.5.4. The EOC is the C2 support element that coordinates information and resources to
   support the installation’s actions before, during, and after an incident. The EOC is activated
   and recalled by the Installation Commander. The EOC updates the CAT with continuing
   incident status and request support through the CAT when on-scene requirements surpass the
   installation’s inherent cumulative capabilities. EOCs may support the Multiagency
AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014                                                     21


   Coordination System and joint information activities. See Figure 2.2, On-Base and Off-Base
   Emergency Management Comparison. Core functions of the EOC must include:

Figure 2.2. On-Base and Off-Base Emergency Management Comparison




Note: The Secretary of State coordinates international activities related to the prevention,
preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation for foreign incidents and to protect United
States citizens and United States interests overseas.

       2.5.4.1. Command and Control. The EOC must provide command and control functions
       necessary to place multiple measured response and recovery plans into action and
       implementing them as needed. Additionally, EOC must provide the organizational
       structure required to determine mission capability, allocate resources and personnel, and
       ensure the effective direction of personnel supporting response and recovery operations.
       2.5.4.2. Coordination and Planning. The EOC must have capabilities to coordinate
       closely with the CAT, CP, BDOC, Mobile Emergency Operations Center (MEOC), UCC,
       and the IC to ensure comprehensive situational awareness for the entire installation. It
       must have mechanisms to coordinate and document steps taken to respond to an event,
       and create and maintain records of actions taken to protect personnel, infrastructure, and
       mission assets. The EOC must support planning and emergency preparedness efforts to
       reduce or eliminate the impacts of, and facilitate the quick response to an incident.
       2.5.4.3. Communications. The EOC communication capabilities must include
       exchanging data with First and Emergency Responders, the MEOC, and UCCs.
       Additional consideration should be given to other EOCs and public emergency response
       and recovery agencies.
       2.5.4.4. Resource dispatch and tracking. The EOC must be able to coordinate, allocate,
       mobilize, dispatch and track resources (personnel, vehicles, equipment, funds) to support
       incident response efforts.
       2.5.4.5. Information collection, analysis, and dissemination. The EOC must have the
       capability to collect, analyze and disseminate information to identify and determine the
22                                 AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014


     nature of the incident, mitigate its effects, assess damage caused by the incident and
     support recovery operations. Consideration must be given to disseminating and
     coordinating information to installation personnel and the local community, as required.
  2.5.5. The EOC Director is usually the Mission Support Group (MSG) Commander. Any
  properly trained senior representative designated by the Installation Commander may fill the
  position. The EOC Director provides oversight for the Installation Commander to support
  and control emergency response to incidents. The EOC Director can support multiple ICs
  simultaneously while providing senior officer level C2 for sustained response and recovery
  operations. When senior military authority or assessment is required on the scene, the EOC
  Director or designate can move from the EOC to the incident site. Before leaving the EOC,
  the EOC Director must appoint and brief a replacement. The replacement must meet the
  same training requirements as the EOC Director (see Chapter 6). On scene, the IC maintains
  legal authority and tactical control, including establishing a National Defense Area (NDA)
  with the advice of the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA). When on the scene, the EOC Director
  serves as the senior military representative to maintain military command authority over
  military resources as required by law.
  2.5.6. EOC Manager. The Installation Commander appoints in writing, the Readiness and
  EM officer, Superintendent, Senior Emergency Management Technician (3E9X1), or civilian
  or contractor equivalent as the EOC Manager.
     2.5.6.1. The EOC manager works for the EOC Director by providing support and
     functional expertise for emergency C2 of DOD resources through the ESFs.
     2.5.6.2. The EOC Manager will stand up the EOC when directed and oversee the EOC
     operations, including collecting information about the incident, utilization of functional
     IEMP 10-2 checklists by ESF members, and providing the EOC director with updates.
     See AFMAN 32-1007, Readiness and Emergency Management (R&EM) Flight
     Operations, for additional EOC Manager roles and responsibilities.
     2.5.6.3. The EOC Manager will facilitate a quarterly Table-Top exercise to address the
     core capabilities listed in Chapter 7. All EOC members must attend at least one session
     annually.
  2.5.7. The Emergency Support Function capabilities are grouped into an organizational
  structure that provides support, resources, program implementation, and services most likely
  to be needed during an incident. Installation ESFs serve as the primary operational support
  mechanism. Personnel assigned as ESF representatives must be knowledgeable and have
  decision-making authority for their function. Also, they must meet training requirements in
  Table 6.1. See Attachment 2, Emergency Support Functions for more information. The ESF
  Annexes of the NRF provide added discussion about roles and responsibilities of ESF
  coordinators, primary agencies, and support agencies.
  2.5.8. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) Control Center is co-located
  with the EOC whenever possible. The CBRN Control Center is managed under ESF 5,
  Emergency Management. The control center is subordinate to the EOC director and serves as
  an advisory element to the EOC and the Installation Commander. The control center directs
  CBRN reconnaissance to shape the hazards and advises the commander on hazards,
  countermeasures, and protective actions. The CBRN Control Center plots and maintains
AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014                                                   23


  CBRN hazard status on the airbase, in off-base areas of operational concern and at potential
  recovery bases. The CBRN Control Center also conducts CBRN plotting and reporting
  activities according to AF Tactics, Techniques, Procedures (Interservice) (AFTTP (I) 3-2.56,
  Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for CBRN Contamination Avoidance) or
  additional MAJCOM guidance. The control center may include the host nation or coalition
  CBRN defense specialists and may provide reciprocal manning at the host nation control
  center.
  2.5.9. The Incident Commander is a trained and experienced responder that provides on-
  scene tactical control using subject matter experts (SME) and support from other functions.
  The Fire and Emergency Services will be the incident commander for all incidents involving
  two or more response agencies. The initial First Responder will assume the IC position until
  the senior FES person arrives on scene. Once on scene, command is formally transferred
  from the initial First Responder to the senior FES person. For example, Security Forces
  responds to a hostage situation and the senior security forces member will assume IC until
  FES arrives on scene. Then SF briefs the senior FES person and transfers command. The SF
  person then assumes the operations branch chief position to provide direct tactical
  operational support to the IC.
     2.5.9.1. ICs accomplish Incident Command System training according to Chapter 6 and
     meet DOD and Federal certification standards. For events involving a biological disease
     outbreak, the Installation Commander may appoint the appropriate medical officer as the
     IC. As the National Integration Center (NIC) develops qualification and certification
     standards, guidelines, and protocols, the Air Force will consider for adoption.
     2.5.9.2. Upon issuance of NIC guidance and until the Air Force develops a credentialing
     program for emergency responders, the Air Force FES personnel performing in the
     capacity of IC or other key command positions must meet the training requirements
     described in Table 6.1, and be credentialed using the Fire Emergency Services
     Credentialing (FESCRE) program. FESCRE program components are available on the
     Air Force FES Community of Practice (CoP).
  2.5.10. First Responders, as defined by AFIMS, are members of the DRF elements that
  deploy immediately to the disaster scene to provide initial C2, to save lives, and to suppress
  and control hazards. Firefighters, law enforcement and security personnel, key emergency
  medical personnel, and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) during Improvised Explosive
  Device (IED) and nuclear accident response operations provide the initial, immediate
  response to major accidents, natural disasters, and CBRNE incidents. All First Responders
  are Emergency Responders, but not all Emergency Responders are First Responders. First
  Responder duties have priority over other assigned duties.
  2.5.11. Emergency Responders, as defined by AFIMS, are members of the DRF elements
  that deploy after the First Responders to expand C2 and provide additional support.
  Emergency Responders include follow-on firefighters, law enforcement and security
  personnel, and emergency medical technicians, EOD personnel, physicians, nurses, medical
  treatment providers at medical treatment facilities (first receivers), emergency management
  personnel, public health officers, bioenvironmental engineer, mortuary affairs personnel, and
  other specialized team members. Emergency Responder duties have priority over other
  assigned duties. Emergency Responders are not assigned as augmentees or to additional
24                                 AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014


  duties that will conflict with their emergency duties. See Attachment 3 for specific
  Emergency Responder CBRNE roles and responsibilities.
  2.5.12. UCCs provide response and recovery support to the IC as directed by the EOC and
  mission support to the Installation Commander as directed by CAT. The EOC and CAT
  resolve any conflicting requirements. UCCs provide a focal point within an organization to
  maintain unit C2, relay information to and from unit personnel, provide expertise to the EOC
  or IC, and leverage unit resources to respond to and mitigate the incident. Unit Commanders
  will assign knowledgeable personnel to the EOC and the UCC to facilitate mission
  accomplishment.
  2.5.13. Installation and Unit Specialized Teams/Positions.
     2.5.13.1. Specialized teams are formed from the existing installation and unit personnel
     resources to support emergency response operations. Specialized team duty becomes the
     team member’s primary duty during response, exercises, and training. Team members
     must not be assigned conflicting emergency duties. Enough team members must be
     appointed for 24-hour-a-day operations.
         2.5.13.1.1. Emergency Management Support Team (EMST). The EMST is a trained
         team that augments the R&EM Flight during emergency response or natural disaster
         operations. Commanders and supervisors of EMST members must understand that
         when recalled, the EMST becomes the member’s primary duty.
             2.5.13.1.1.1. Because of the large volume of performance tasks, sufficient EMST
             members must be identified based upon installation needs to augment the R&EM
             Flight key positions for incident response and wartime operations. Members are
             trained on incident response operations, command and control, operating a
             contamination control area, operating a contamination control station (for nuclear
             incidents), decontamination operations, operating the MEOC, response plans,
             CBRN reconnaissance and other areas required by the installation.
             2.5.13.1.1.2. For low threat areas, EMST members may assist in the EOC,
             Incident Command Post (ICP), and R&EM Flight. In high threat areas, EMST
             may assist as a member of the CBRN reconnaissance team, contamination control
             area team, EOC, CBRN Control Center, and in the R&EM Flight.
         2.5.13.1.2. Shelter Management Team (SMT). Installations establish SMTs when
         there is a requirement for extended sheltering of base personnel during natural
         disasters or wartime operations. For example, when an installation shelters personnel
         on base during hurricanes, shelter management teams need to be identified and
         trained before the hurricane season begins. In addition, high threat locations may have
         collective protection systems that require SMTs during wartime operations to be pre-
         identified and trained on shelter management duties and the operations of the
         collective protection systems. See AFMAN 10-2503, Operations in a Chemical,
         Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High Yield Explosive (CBRNE) Environment
         for additional requirements about wartime shelter operations.
             2.5.13.1.2.1. Unit commanders will assign enough SMT members to provide 24-
             hour coverage in the shelter. Ensure SMT members do not have conflicting duties.
             If a home station CBRN threat does not exist, training is only required for the
AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014                                                  25


          appropriate number of shelter management personnel necessary for natural
          disaster and major accident activities. Should a subsequent CBRN threat manifest
          itself, such as the threat of nuclear war, SMTs are identified, trained, and
          equipped at the appropriate Defense Condition (DEFCON) state or stage of alert.
          For wartime operations, minimum team size, for emergency operations and rest
          and relief shelters used for CBRN protection is one shelter manager, one exposure
          control monitor, and one Contamination Control Area (CCA) supervisor each
          shift. For natural disaster shelters, the minimum team requirement is one shelter
          manager, one monitor for registration/accountability of the shelter occupants, one
          security person, and one person for logistics. When additional personnel are
          required, the unit commander responsible for the shelter will identify the
          requirements to be resourced from installation personnel or from the shelter
          occupants.
          2.5.13.1.2.2. Shelter managers are responsible for setting up the shelter with
          equipment and supplies required for housing, feeding, and sanitation for the
          shelter occupants. They need to account for and manage the sheltered and the
          shelter management team and other management duties required by installation
          guidelines.
          2.5.13.1.2.3. SMTs are not used during Shelter-In-Place (SIP) actions since SIP is
          only for short durations. The facility manager or emergency management
          representative must coordinate protective measures for the facility during SIP
          actions.
       2.5.13.1.3. Contamination Control Teams (CCT). These teams are comprised of unit
       personnel that perform contamination control measures specific to the incident. Unit
       personnel fill all CCT positions. Units that must have threat-based CCTs include
       Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS), Maintenance, Munitions, Medical, and Civil
       Engineers. Contamination control teams are required to perform decontamination on
       assets under the control of their functional area for both peacetime incidents and
       wartime operations. The installation commander decides whether contamination
       control teams are established. Criteria for the decision are threat, contamination type,
       installation capabilities, mission impact, and if decontamination will reduce
       protective measures. Emergency Management personnel train CCTs, and each
       functional area develops a CCT checklist for decontaminating specific equipment
       under their control. For additional information, see AFMAN 10-2503 and AFTTP 3-
       2.60, CBRN Decontamination.
          2.5.13.1.3.1. Unit commanders will assign enough members to each CCT to
          conduct decontamination operations. Form and activate CCTs when thorough
          decontamination is required. The installation commander decides when the
          accomplishment of thorough decontamination is likely to produce an
          operationally beneficial result. And, when the time required conducting
          decontamination operations is worth the effort to increase the operational tempo
          or reduce the Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) level. The installation
          commander determines when there is a need for an installation CCT or when
          those units identified to establish CCTs are required to conduct the
          decontamination operation. For example, large numbers of vehicles requiring
26                             AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014


        decontamination may require the installation commander to decide to have the
        LRS (Transportation) conduct the decontamination operation or establish a team
        from several base agencies with a Transportation representative to oversee the
        operation. Teams receive just-in-time training from the R&EM Flight when the
        requirement for CCTs is established.
        2.5.13.1.3.2. Units required to have a CCT must ensure the team has the
        equipment to conduct decontamination operations. Units must develop checklists
        for each CCT. The R&EM Flight can assist with the development. The functional
        area managers for LRS, Maintenance, Munitions, Medical, and CE provides
        guidance about decontaminating assets under their responsibility and availability
        of the required equipment.
     2.5.13.1.4. Post Attack Reconnaissance (PAR) Team. PAR teams are organized,
     trained, and equipped by the unit. PAR teams are used after an attack to survey
     around facilities or areas of responsibility for unexploded ordnance (UXOs),
     contamination, facility damage, and other hazards. Use post-attack reconnaissance to
     determine what happened in an attack. PAR teams are established by units to provide
     a quick assessment of contamination, UXOs, and damage to unit facilities. PAR
     teams are controlled by their UCC. PAR teams report all information to their UCC,
     and the UCC then reports the information to the appropriate ESF within the EOC.
        2.5.13.1.4.1. The minimum size for a PAR team is two people. One person must
        watch for hazards, provide security, and call for assistance when needed. The
        other person must conduct the area survey. Units will establish enough PAR
        teams to survey their facilities or areas after an attack. Units need to establish the
        number of teams based on the number of facilities, area of responsibility, and how
        quickly the installation commander requires the assessment completed.
        2.5.13.1.4.2. Units having PAR teams must ensure they are properly equipped
        and have the proper checklists to conduct their sweeps. AFMAN 10-2503 has
        sample PAR team checklists, reports, and a team supply list.
     2.5.13.1.5. Other teams support the installation’s emergency response depending
     upon the installation mission and threat. Teams that support recovery, either on the
     scene, or on the installation, may include Search and Recovery, Crash Recovery,
     Home Station Medical Response, and Spill Response Teams. These teams are trained
     and equipped according to functional guidance. When requested by the EOC,
     specialized and other support teams are activated through their UCCs when situations
     require their specialized skills and equipment.
     2.5.13.1.6. Recovery Operations Chief. Once the emergency is over and recovery
     starts, the IC must officially transfer control of the site to the Recovery Operations
     Chief (ROC). The ROC is a subject matter expert in the hazards or activities within
     the incident site. When it is a Hazardous Material (HAZMAT) incident, the ROC that
     assumes control of the site must be knowledgeable about the hazards and recovery
     procedures. The EOC Director selects the ROC. AFMAN 10-2504, Air Force
     Incident Management Guidance for Major Accidents and Natural Disasters defines
     the role of the ROC in major accident and natural disaster recovery operations.
AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014                                               27


       2.5.13.1.7. Senior Military Representatives (SMR). The installation commander can
       dispatch to, or the incident commander can request a SMR at the incident site. The
       SMR’s primary purpose is to liaison with media and outside agencies during high
       visibility incidents or to support the incident commander. A SMR is not required at a
       vast majority of incidents. On scene, unless a transfer of Incident Command authority
       occurs, the existing IC maintains tactical control.

   3.11.18. (DELETED)
   3.11.19. Ensure personnel who are inherently deployable to CBRNE defense threat areas can
   perform mission-essential tasks in a contaminated environment. Do not levy this requirement
   against personnel who are specifically exempted. Inherently deployable (in) and specifically
   exempted (out) are defined in AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution.
   3.11.20. Ensure that all unit military personnel maintain and use AFPAM 10-100, Airman’s
   Manual, during exercises and real world contingencies. Furthermore, determine AFPAM 10-
   100 requirements for unit emergency-essential civilian and emergency-essential contractor
   personnel.
   3.11.21. Ensure that the unit EM Representatives complete semi-annual self-inspections
   according to this instruction.
   3.11.21. (TINKERAFB) UEMRs will complete self-assessments IAW AFMAN 32-1007.

   operations (including, but not limited to agencies having aircraft, missiles, spacecraft,
   explosives, or petroleum; those performing open-air work, recreational activities, and
   underground utility work) of impending severe weather events and ensure understanding of
   appropriate weather terminology.
      3.11.22.1. Issuance of a weather watch alerts recipients to the “potential” for severe
      weather. Upon receipt of a weather watch, operations may continue, but personnel in high
      risk areas should be prepared to implement required protective actions.
      3.11.22.2. Issuance of a weather warning alerts recipients that a severe weather event is
      imminent within a specific time frame. Upon receipt of a weather warning, immediately
      implement required protective actions to safeguard life and property.
      3.11.22.3. Create and document pre-severe weather protective measures, as well as post-
      severe weather response plans, for their operations. As a minimum, procedures developed
      will address:
          3.11.22.3.1. Actions to safeguard personnel, aircraft, equipment and other supplies
          stored outdoors, and protect facilities to include severe weather shelter locations.
          3.11.22.3.2. Actions to take prior to resuming operations following a severe weather
          episode.
   3.11.23. (Added-TINKERAFB) UEMRs will ensure all newly assigned personnel are
   briefed on shelter and kit locations and any other unit specific actions for severe weather.
   The UEMR, safety representative or individual supervisor may provide this information
   during in processing.
3.12. Installation and Unit Specialized Teams.
   3.12.1. Specialized teams are formed from the existing installation and unit personnel
   resources to support emergency response operations. Specialized team duty becomes a team
   member’s primary duty during response, exercises and training. Team members should not
 54                                 AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014


   be assigned conflicting emergency duties. Enough team members must be appointed for 24-
   hour-a-day operations.
       3.12.1.1. Readiness Support Team (RST). The RST is a trained team that augments the
       CE Readiness Flight. RST members must not be assigned to other additional duties that
       conflict with RST duties. Commanders and supervisors of RST members must
       understand that when the RST is recalled, RST becomes an RST member’s primary duty.
       3.12.1.2. Shelter Management Team (SMT). The SMT is comprised of two elements,
       unit personnel assigned and trained to perform management duties and sheltered
       personnel identified by the shelter supervisor to augment trained personnel.
       3.12.1.3. Contamination Control Teams (CCT). These teams are comprised of unit
       personnel who perform contamination control measures specific to the incident. Unit
       personnel fill all CCT positions. Units that must have threat-based CCTs include
       Transportation, Maintenance, Munitions, Medical, and Civil Engineers.
       3.12.1.4. Post Attack Reconnaissance (PAR) Team. PAR teams are organized, trained
       and equipped by the unit. The minimum size for a PAR team is two people so one person
       can watch for hazards, provide security and call for assistance if needed.
   3.12.2. Other teams support the installation’s emergency response depending upon the
   installation mission and threat. Teams that support recovery, either on scene or on the
   installation, may include Search and Recovery, Crash Recovery and IPPD. The IPPD is used
   at the medical treatment facility to decontaminate casualties and responders. These teams are
   trained and equipped IAW functional guidance. Teams are activated through the EOC and
   their UCC when situations require their specialized skills and equipment.
3.13. Installation Functional Support. Installation functional support is listed in Attachment
2 through Attachment 4.

                                            Chapter 4

     AIR FORCE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (EM) PROGRAM PLANNING,
                      THREATS AND RESPONSE

4.1. Purpose. This chapter provides an overview of the AFIMS phases of incident
management. It discusses general information concerning the major EM threats, delineates
policy for each type of incident and summarizes the phases of incident management as they
apply to that type of incident.
4.2. General. The primary objective of EM program planning is to support Air Force plans by
minimizing effects caused by all-hazards incidents. EM program planning addresses a wide
range of threats for the Air Force. The Air Force EM program implements the AFIMS based on
NIMS methodology and includes the NRP standardized phases of incident management:
prevention, preparedness, response, recovery and mitigation. These phases of incident
management are discussed in paragraph 4.5
   4.2.1. Installations, including tenant units, will tailor their response capability to the
   installation’s mission and threat assessment. Commanders must stress both planning and
   response to provide unity of effort, allocate resources efficiently and identify shortfalls early.
   Force survivability and mission continuation are the highest priorities for planning.
   4.2.2. The planning goals listed below are not in priority order:
       4.2.2.1. Decentralize vital operations and mission-critical resources.
       4.2.2.2. Disperse, shelter, or cover response and recovery resources.
       4.2.2.3. Relocate, evacuate, or shelter all personnel affected or potentially affected by the
       incident.
       4.2.2.4. Provide IPE for FP and PPE for incident response and recovery.
       4.2.2.5. Improve protection for buildings used as shelters.
       4.2.2.6. Develop MAAs with civilian and host nation authorities.
       4.2.2.7. Provide information, notification and warning systems.
       4.2.2.8. Implement CBRNE detection, risk assessment, avoidance, control, plotting,
       predicting, warning and reporting measures.
       4.2.2.9. Provide information flow between C2 elements and the general installation
       populace.
       4.2.2.10. Provide recovery actions from effects of EM incidents.
       4.2.2.11. Provide survivable, interoperable communications.
       4.2.2.12. Ensure seamless operations with other Federal agencies in response to
       Catastrophic Events or Incidents of National Significance as defined by DODD 3025.15,
       NIMS and the NRP. Ensure plans support other Federal agencies during Incidents of
       National Significance.
 56                                   AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014


   4.2.3. Planning is based upon a threat assessment that enables commanders to identify
   minimum standards to train, organize, equip and protect forces. The CBRNE threat areas are
   shown in Table 4.1, Worldwide CBRNE Threat Area Table. This table was based upon the
   Threat Compendium: Worldwide Threat to Airbases and developed under the guidance of
   AF/A7CXR with support from HQ AFCESA/CEX, in coordination with MAJCOM Civil
   Engineers and cannot be changed without AF/A7CXR approval. The table is provided to
   assist with equipment planning and budgeting only. See 6 for training requirements.
   Installations must evaluate the current operations, intelligence reports, and risk assessments
   to determine the current local threat. CBRNE High, Medium, and Low Threat Areas are
   defined in Attachment 1

Table 4.1. Worldwide Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield
Explosive (CBRNE) Threat Area Table.
         CBRNE Threat Area                 Geographical Location
      1. High Threat Area (HTA)            Bahrain, Balkans Region, Diego Garcia, Egypt, Greece,
                                           India, Israel, Jordan, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
                                           Pakistan, Qatar, Republic of China (Taiwan), Republic of
                                           Korea, Somalia, Singapore, Sudan, Thailand, Turkey, and
                                           United Arab Emirates
      2. Medium Threat Area (MTA)          Germany, Italy, Japan, and Yemen
      3. Low Threat Area (LTA)             All locations not listed as a high or medium threat area

      NOTE: See the Threat Compendium: Worldwide Threat to Airbases for further threat-related
      information.
   4.2.4. The nature of conventional and asymmetrical CBRNE weapons and their delivery
   systems makes positive identification of the type of attack difficult until after the attack has
   occurred. Commanders should tailor their forces and employ threat-specific countermeasures
   that mitigate risk to resources and personnel necessary to sustain operations. Intelligence and
   counterintelligence activities support EM by assessing enemy order of battle, means of
   delivery, weapons type, or agent fill and the conditions under which hostile forces may
   employ these weapons.
   4.2.5. The All-Hazards Risk Management Process is comprised of three assessments that
   provide the installation with a foundation on which to base procedural and resource decisions
   to enhance emergency preparedness, contingency response, and mission continuation.
   Installations will use these assessments to tailor and refine their Installation Emergency
   Management Plan to installation-specific threats and vulnerabilities. The three assessments,
   which must be performed annually, include the Hazard Assessment, the Vulnerability
   Assessment, and the Capabilities Assessment. The EMWG will provide oversight of these
   assessments. The All-Hazards Response Planning Team will conduct these assessments in
   concert with other installation working groups. See AFMAN 10-2504, for additional Hazard,
   Vulnerability, and Capability Assessment information.
4.3. Installation Emergency Management Plan (IEMP) 10-2. The IEMP 10-2 provides
comprehensive guidance for an emergency response to physical threats resulting from major
AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014                                                       57


accidents, natural disasters, severe weather events, conventional attacks, terrorist attacks, and
CBRNE attacks. Using the AF template as a foundation, all installations must develop an IEMP
10-2 that addresses the hazards and physical threats to their base as defined in the All Hazards
Risk Management Process. The template is located on the Readiness and Emergency
Management CoP.
   4.3.1. IEMP 10-2 Elements. IEMP 10-2 assigns responsibilities to organizations and
   individuals and support areas of pre-incident planning, emergency response, medical and
   public health needs, traumatic stress response and disaster mental health, equipment, law
   enforcement, training, intelligence support, weather support, religious support, security,
   response, and recovery. The IEMP 10-2 must list all required installation specialized teams,
   their composition, and roles/responsibilities.
       4.3.1.1. The IEMP 10-2 must address, as a minimum:
           4.3.1.1.1. Mission, goals, and objectives of the IEM Program.
           4.3.1.1.2. Functional roles, responsibilities, and lines of authority for all personnel,
           organizations, and agencies assigned EM response duties.
           4.3.1.1.3. Preparedness activities including risk management; prevention planning;
           mitigation planning; training; exercises; interagency coordination, and equipment
           requirements.
           4.3.1.1.4. Response and recovery planning according to AFMAN 10-2502, Air Force
           Incident Management System (AFIMS) Standards and Procedures. Specific response
           considerations should include: continuity of operations; evacuation management and
           mass care planning; volunteer and donations management; Family Assistance Center
           crisis and mass casualty response that establishes procedures to integrate victim and
           family services in response to the full spectrum of crisis or catastrophic events; crisis
           and mass casualty response that integrates religious support in response to the full
           spectrum of crisis or catastrophic events; Appropriate dynamic protocols to allow
           non-DoD first responders to access the installation in an emergency.
           4.3.1.1.5. Communication through all phases of an emergency.
       4.3.1.2. The IEMP 10-2 must be coordinated through all tasked agencies and should be
       coordinated with all units and agencies, to include tenant units, on the installation. At a
       minimum, the IEMP 10-2 is updated annually. Incorporate lessons learned and
       opportunities for improvement identified during exercises and risk management activities
       during plan updates.
       4.3.1.2. (TINKERAFB) IEMP 10-2 review, re-write and coordination will be IAW
       TAFB Plan 10-401, Tinker AFB Operations Planning and Execution.
       4.3.1.3. The IEMP 10-2 should be coordinated with OPRs of other installation
       protection-related program plans such as but not limited to the AT Plan, Integrated
       Defense Plan, Medical Contingency Response Plan (MCRP), ESP, Disease Containment
       Plan (DCP), and Installation Deployment Plan (IDP), FES, Environmental, and
       Hazardous Materials Plans. Any conflicts with other plans must be resolved before
       publication.
58                                  AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014


     4.3.1.4. During deployments, commanders may need to use other plans, such as the ESP
     prepared according to AFI 10-404, Base Support and Expeditionary (BAS&E) Site
     Planning, to provide EM-specific execution tasks until an IEMP 10-2 is developed.
     4.3.1.5. Sufficient resources may not be available early in a deployment to implement a
     comprehensive EM program. If installations require resources from local authorities,
     those resources should be identified and how, who, and when those resources will be
     provided should be addressed in the plan.
     4.3.1.6. R&EM Flights will provide an information copy of the IEMP 10-2, unless it is
     classified, to local civilian agencies as part of their total coordination effort.
  4.3.2. Each installation unit, including all DOD and Non-DOD tenants, must use the IEMP
  10-2 to develop unit-specific checklists to support the IEMP 10-2 within 60 days of
  publication. Checklists must tell who, what, when, where and how actions will be
  accomplished. Each unit must develop checklists for utilization by specialized team members
  they control. Once checklists are complete and before implementation, they must be
  coordinated through the R&EM Flight and approved by the unit commander.
  4.3.2. (TINKERAFB) Units not tasked in the Installation Emergency Management Plan 10-
  2, as a minimum, will develop local checklists or procedures for recall and accountability;
  severe weather notification; and shelter activation.
  4.3.3. Joint Bases (JB) where the AF is the supporting component will provide support to all
  JB assigned and attached units, located on and off the installation. JB units will be
  incorporated into the host installation’s IEMP 10-2. The units that fell under the supported
  component must be identified in the JB MOA so the supporting component can include them
  into their emergency management program and the IEMP 10-2. If the AF is the supported
  Component, they are not required to develop an IEMP 10-2, but must develop EM operating
  procedures/checklists and coordinate them with the supporting Emergency Management
  office/agency. Where possible, the supported Component will integrate response and
  recovery actions with the supporting Component.
  4.3.4. MAJCOM may provide specific EM program guidance for their installations,
  including MAJCOM instructions for program management, exercise, and administrative
  information. Response must conform to AFIMS.
  4.3.5. DRUs, FOAs, and Numbered Air Forces support the EM Program as directed by their
  MAJCOM. DRUs, and FOAs that report directly to the Chief of Staff, US Air Force, will
  maintain a current, executable EM plan and supporting checklists or ensure that they are
  included in their host installation EM plan and maintain the appropriate checklists.
  4.3.6. GSUs are not required to develop an IEMP 10-2, but they must develop EM operating
  procedures and coordinate them with the host R&EM Flight. MAJCOMs will supplement

  4.3.7. Review documents that address elements of the Air Force EM program when
  developing the IEMP 10-2. Documents to review include all hazard assessments, intelligence
  reports, training and equipment standards, installation plans, MAAs, ESPs, and joint support
  plans. Integrate the capabilities provided by other documents, or cross-reference them to
  avoid duplication.
     4.3.7.1. Annex A: Major Accidents.
     4.3.7.2. Annex B: Natural Disasters.
     4.3.7.3. Annex C: Enemy CBRNE Attacks. Unless specifically mandated by MAJCOMs,
     CONUS bases that determine they have a low threat from this kind of action are not
     required to write this annex.
     4.3.7.4. Annex D: Terrorist Use of CBRNE.
     4.3.7.5. Annex Z: Distribution. NOTE: Disease containment planning has applicability
     to multiple annexes. Naturally occurring disease outbreaks, such as Severe Acute
     Respiratory Syndrome or pandemic flu, are considered a natural disaster and are
     addressed in Annex B. Biological warfare attack can come from a traditional adversary
     (Annex C) or from a terrorist group (Annex D). Because Air Force disease containment
     planning is biological attack-focused, it is included in Annex C, CBRNE Attack.
     Annexes B and D will cross-reference to Annex C when planning for a naturally
     occurring disease outbreak or terrorist use of biological weapons.
  4.3.8. Classify and handle the IEMP 10-2 according to AFI 31-401, Information Security
  Program Management. Three options are available for IEMP 10-2 classification:
     4.3.8.1. The plan should be unclassified to ensure maximum distribution, but designated
     For Official Use Only.
     4.3.8.2. If portions of the plan are classified, those portions must receive appropriate
     handling and should be distributed separately according to AFI 31-401.
     4.3.8.3. If the entire plan is classified, follow instructions in AFI 31-401.
  4.3.9. The plan lists key actions commanders and tasked agencies must accomplish based on
  the threat. Annexes should not repeat the main plan. Base the plan on the template located on
  the Air Force Portal. When EM guidance is included in another plan, such as the ESP or
  WMP-1, or DCP reference the other plan but do not repeat the guidance. The IEMP 10-2 has
  five annexes. Note: Disease containment planning has applicability to multiple annexes.
  Naturally occurring disease outbreaks, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or
  pandemic flu, are considered a natural disaster and are addressed in Annex B. Biological
  warfare attack can come from a traditional adversary (Annex C) or from a terrorist group
  (Annex D). Because Air Force disease containment planning is biological attack-focused, it
  is referenced in Annex C, CRBNE Attack. Annexes B and D will cross-reference to Annex C
  when planning for a naturally occurring disease outbreak or terrorist use of biological
  weapons.
     4.3.9.1. Annex A: Major Accidents.
     4.3.9.2. Annex B: Natural Disasters.

       4.3.9.3. Annex C: Enemy CBRNE Attacks. Unless specifically mandated by MAJCOM,
       CONUS bases that determine they have a low threat from this action are not required to
       write this annex.
       4.3.9.4. Annex D: Terrorist Use of CBRNE.
       4.3.9.5. Annex Z: Distribution.
   4.3.10. The Automated Civil Engineer System Personnel Readiness (ACES-PR) system will
   be the primary method used to track status, coordination, and inputs to the IEMP 10-2 and
   Civil Engineer Contingency Response Plan (CRP).

4.5. Standard Phases of Incident Management. HSPD-5 and Presidential Policy Directive-8,
National Preparedness, policy defines a single, comprehensive approach to incident
management as prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks, major
disasters, and other emergencies. The Air Force has established five phases of incident
management as prevention, preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation. These phases of
incident management have been incorporated into AFIMS and provide the framework with
which the installation DRF responds to all EM events. Comprehensive definitions of these
phases are included in Attachment 1. Actions that were traditionally considered to be pre-event
or pre-attack actions are considered as prevention, preparedness, and mitigation actions under
AFIMS. Actions that were traditionally considered to be trans-event or trans-attack actions are
considered response or mitigation actions under AFIMS. Actions that were traditionally
considered to be event recovery or attack recovery actions are considered recovery or mitigation
actions under AFIMS. Under AFIMS, the DRF includes the CAT, CP, ECC, EOC, IC, First
Responders, Emergency Responders, UCCs, ESFs, specialized teams, the ROC, and SMRs. The
DRF is used to respond to all incidents, although it may be configured differently depending
upon the incident.
   4.5.1. For AFIMS, prevention includes broad categories of activities such as intelligence
   collection and analysis, active defense, proliferation prevention, fire prevention, disease
   prevention and contamination prevention. Prevention also includes more specific tasks such
   as Safety Mishap Investigations that contribute information to prevent future mishaps.
   4.5.2. For AFIMS, preparedness includes actions such as planning discussed in Chapter 4,
   the Air Force EM training covered in Chapter 6 and the Air Force EM exercise and
   evaluation covered in Chapter 7. Preparedness also includes specific tasks such as
   identifying augmentation manpower needs or reviewing ESPs.
   4.5.3. Under AFIMS, response includes deploying the DRF (see Chapter 4), executing the
   IEMP 10-2 (this chapter) and notification and warning (see Chapter 9).
       4.5.3.1. Imminently serious conditions resulting from any civil emergency or attack may
       require immediate action by military commanders to save lives, prevent human suffering,
       or mitigate great property damage.
       4.5.3.2. When such conditions exist and time does not permit prior approval from higher
       headquarters, local military commanders and responsible officials of other DOD
       components can respond to civil authorities’ requests, with follow-on reporting through
       the appropriate command chain as soon as possible.
AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014                                                        61


   4.5.4. For AFIMS, recovery includes operations such as implementing casualty treatment,
   unexploded ordnance (UXO) safing, Contamination Control Area (CCA) processing, airfield
   damage repair and facility restoration. Recovery planning and actions begin as soon as
   possible to ensure sustainment of crucial missions and restoration of normal operations.
   4.5.5. For AFIMS, mitigation includes general measures. Mitigation is an ongoing process
   and is considered, to some degree, a part of every phase of incident management. In a global
   sense, mitigation includes all activities designed to reduce or eliminate risks to persons or
   property or to lessen the actual or potential effects or consequences of an incident. See the
   NRP for a more detailed discussion of mitigation during all phases of incident management.
   See also paragraphs 4.6.6.5., 4.7.4.5., 4.8.4.5 and 4.9.4.5 for discussions of how mitigation
   is applied during each type of incident.
4.6. Major Accidents, Including Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT).
   4.6.1. The Air Force EM program addresses major accident responses through this
   instruction, while the Air Force Safety program addresses mishaps through AFI 91-204.
   Major accidents are defined in paragraph 4.6.2 Mishaps are defined in paragraph 4.6.2.2
   The differences between major accidents and mishaps are discussed in paragraph 4.6.3
   4.6.2. A major accident is an accident of such a magnitude as to warrant response by the
   installation DRF. It differs from day-to-day emergencies and incidents that are routinely
   handled by base agencies without the DRF. A major accident may involve one or more of the
   following:
      4.6.2.1. Hazardous substances, such as radioactive materials, TIC/TIMs, or explosives.
      4.6.2.2. Class A Mishap. A mishap is an unplanned occurrence or series of occurrences
      that results in damage or injury and meets Class A, B, C, or D mishap reporting criteria
      IAW AFI 91-204. Specific examples include damage to DOD property, occupational
      illness to DOD military or civilian personnel, injury to DOD military personnel on- or
      off-duty, injury to on-duty DOD civilian personnel, damage to public or private property,
      or injury or illness to non-DOD personnel caused by Air Force operations. Class A
      mishaps may be categorized as major accidents, depending upon the situation and the
      need for the DRF.
      4.6.2.3. Extensive property damage.
      4.6.2.4. Grave risk of injury or death to personnel.
      4.6.2.5. Adverse public reaction.
   4.6.3. The relationship between major accidents and mishaps may be misleading because the
   definition of a mishap is broader than the definition of a major accident. A mishap includes
   all major accidents, plus some minor accidents, plus occupation illnesses and injuries to
   individuals. Conversely, the scope of an actual major accident may far exceed the scope of an
   actual mishap. For example, a mishap may occur where only one person is injured in an
   industrial accident, less than $20,000 of direct cost is involved, or an injury does not result in
   any loss of time from work. This mishap would not be considered a major accident and
   would not require a DRF response. Major accidents differ from the minor day-to-day
   emergencies and incidents that installation agencies typically handle. All major accidents are
   considered mishaps, but not all mishaps are considered major accidents.
62                                  AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014


  4.6.4. Examples of major accidents include nuclear weapon accidents, HAZMAT spills,
  aircraft crashes, and fires. Through the IEMP 10-2, the Air Force plans response for specific
  types of major accidents such as HAZMAT incidents or aircraft accidents.
  4.6.5. The DOD must respond to major accidents involving DOD resources or resulting from
  DOD activities. AFI 10-206 and AFI 91-204 provide reporting requirements for mishaps
  involving Air Force equipment or personnel.
     4.6.5.1. The installation must plan, equip and train to provide immediate, decisive
     incident response anytime an incident occurs on the installation. Additionally, the
     installation may respond immediately if the effects of an incident on or off an installation
     extend to or involve surrounding civilian communities or when the need to save lives,
     prevent human suffering or mitigate great property damage is a concern.
     4.6.5.2. The installation may respond immediately when acting under an immediate
     response condition, when acting according to an existing MAA, or when civil authorities
     request assistance and time does not allow prior approval from higher headquarters. The
     installation must report any assistance provided as soon as possible. The installation
     should begin tracking all support expenditures as soon as response begins and continue
     until response ends. See AFI 10-801.
     4.6.5.3. For accidents involving nuclear weapons or their components, Installation
     Commanders must adhere to AF/PA policy according to AFI 35-101, Public Affairs
     Responsibilities and Management. They must provide effective PA activities near the
     scene of a nuclear weapon accident and speed the flow of information to the public and
     the internal audience. In the United States, its territories, or its possessions, DOD policy
     requires the senior ranking military authority on scene, usually the Incident Commander,
     to confirm the presence of nuclear weapons or radioactive nuclear components in the
     interest of public safety or to reduce or prevent widespread public alarm. Public
     authorities must be notified if the public is, or may be, in danger of radiation exposure or
     other danger posed by the weapon or its components. Statements that confirm the
     presence of nuclear weapons should clearly address whether or not the possibility exists
     for exposure to radiation or injury from high explosive (HE) weapon components.
     Foreign theater commanders who have RTF responsibilities provide planning and
     exercise requirements for their supporting RTFs. Domestic MAJCOMs with RTF
     responsibilities, as discussed in Chapter 3, provide additional response procedures in
     their RTF plans.
     4.6.5.4. The Initial Response Base (IRB) coordinates directly with local officials until
     FEMA or host nation officials arrive. The IRB is the nearest military installation having a
     disaster response capability, regardless of size, to a major accident involving DOD
     resources. The Air Force IRB responds unless directed otherwise by the MAJCOM,
     theater, or AFOC. Installations must provide initial response to incidents involving
     nuclear weapons and must control the scene until relieved by higher authority. For
     nuclear weapons accidents, the IRB will proceed to the radiological accident or incident
     scene to render emergency assistance, including maintaining C2 of the accident site until
     relieved by the RTF. Subject to its capabilities, the IRB may be tasked to do the
     following: rescue operations, accident site security, fire fighting, initiation of EOD
AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014                                                     63


     procedures, radiation monitoring, establishing C2 and communications, public affairs
     activities and casualty management.
     4.6.5.5. In accidents involving HAZMAT, the release of public information must comply
     with the specific instructions given in movement and plans or orders and DOD or
     overseas-unified command policies.
     4.6.5.6. Civil authorities oversee off-base response and recovery operations within the
     United States, its territories and possessions. DOS, DOD, COCOM, MAJCOM and
     SOFA describe civil jurisdiction and support for EM in all other areas.
        4.6.5.6.1. Involvement of military resources in an off-base response gives the Air
        Force no specific rights or jurisdiction unless an NDA is established.
        4.6.5.6.2. When directed by higher authority, the Air Force will support civil
        authorities to the maximum extent practical; however, the Air Force’s warfighting
        mission will take priority over support to civilian authorities.
  4.6.6. Major Accident Phases of Incident Management.
     4.6.6.1. Prevention. Major accident prevention includes many actions covered by Air
     Force programs such as the Safety Program IAW AFI 91-204. Although the Air Force
     EM program emphasizes the other phases of incident management, the prevention phase
     can save lives and minimize the need to use resources to respond and recover from major
     accidents.
     4.6.6.2. Preparedness. Examples of preparedness for major accidents include maintaining
     and testing the installation notification and warning system, developing and exercising
     installation recall procedures and certifying equipment. Another example of preparedness
     is publishing, testing and validating response procedures.
     4.6.6.3. Response. Major Accident Response has three overlapping phases – notification,
     response and withdrawal or evacuation.
        4.6.6.3.1. During notification, installation authorities receive notification of an actual
        or potential accident, C2 initiates response and the installation populace is notified.
        Typically, installations will use the primary and secondary crash nets to notify the
        Emergency Responders. Any necessary evacuation or sheltering begins. The
        command post alerts and recalls the EOC and notifies both higher headquarters and
        local civil authorities.
        4.6.6.3.2. Response begins when the First Responders deploy. First Responders
        approach the site, preferably from an upwind or crosswind direction, and perform
        initial lifesaving, rescue, suppression, containment and evacuation. During response,
        the IC arrives on scene to establish C2 and directs life saving, rescue, containment
        and mitigation. Response ends with the completion of fire or hazard suppression,
        emergency rescue, transportation of casualties to medical treatment facilities,
        securing of classified material or components and isolation of hazards.
        4.6.6.3.3. The IC decides whether to evacuate personnel from the hazard area or to
        shelter-in-place. Withdrawal occurs when response forces are in imminent danger or
        all response actions have been completed. Withdrawal may be immediate or planned.
64                                 AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014


        Evacuate people in immediate danger of a downwind hazard. Move victims away
        from the scene and away from responders when evacuating personnel.
     4.6.6.4. Recovery. Establish a RWG to plan recovery operations. Hazard mitigation is
     the cumulative set of tasks focused on a specific hazard to reduce the risks and effects
     associated with that hazard. In addition, commanders use hazard mitigation to plan,
     prepare, and respond effectively to a given hazard. The mitigation phase, in contrast, is a
     general series of actions that continue throughout all AFIMS phases to reduce all-hazards
     risks and effects. Transfer of command to recovery organizations takes place when
     hazard mitigation is complete. Some emergency response elements may remain on the
     scene for safety purposes. The recovery phase restores the area and operations to normal
     conditions. The EOC develops a recovery plan, which is approved by the Installation
     Commander before it is implemented. The recovery plan must address all items in IEMP
     10-2, Annex A, Recovery Operations Checklist, including mishap investigation
     requirements.
     4.6.6.5. Mitigation. Mitigation of risks and effects from major accidents takes two
     primary forms. First, methodical planning to prepare and respond effectively to major
     accidents is accomplished by preparing and exercising plans. According to the NIMS, a
     mitigation plan is considered a subset of preparedness. The Air Force provides mitigation
     planning through the IEMP 10-2, the Mortuary and Services Search and Recovery Plan,
     and others. Second, the installation mitigates the effects of major accidents by performing
     a careful and current hazards analysis considering the population and probable accidents
     and developing appropriate measures to mitigate the results.
     4.6.6.6. All major accidents require the same basic response actions; however, some
     types of accidents require additional issues be considered. Every accident will present
     unique challenges. For example, advanced aerospace materials used in some aircraft can
     release composite fibers that are a known hazard to the respiratory tract, eyes and skin
     and can cause electrical equipment to arc and short. Safety precautions must be observed
     during emergency response, handling, cleanup and disposal. All First Responders must be
     trained on permanently and temporarily assigned installation-specific hazards.
        4.6.6.6.1. Temporary storage of government shipments includes DOE and DOT Safe
        Haven, Safe Parking Shipments and Secure Holding. Safe Haven provides Air Force
        support of military and military-sponsored shipments. Safe Parking provides
        temporary storage of DOE shipments of transuranic waste material. Secure Holding
        provides secure holding areas for commercial carriers transporting Arms,
        Ammunition and Explosives (AA&E), classified materials and Controlled
        Cryptographic Items (CCI) in the interest of public safety and national security.
        4.6.6.6.2. Accidents involving HAZMAT can cause serious problems for Air Force
        installations and the local community. Air Force policy is to comply with the
        emergency planning and notification provisions of the Superfund and Reauthorization
        Act (SARA) of 1986, Title III, Emergency Planning and Community-Right-to-Know
        Act (EPCRA). Installations must keep the State Emergency Response Commission
        (SERC) and LEPC informed of its emergency planning and notification efforts.
        Actions taken when responding to a HAZMAT emergency are identical to those taken
        for other major accidents; however, specific processes and emergency notification
AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014                                                       65


          procedures must be followed during HAZMAT incidents. The core of most
          HAZMAT teams includes the First Responders from FES supplemented by
          Bioenvironmental, CE Readiness and EOD.
4.7. Natural Disasters.
   4.7.1. Natural disasters can create emergency conditions that vary widely in scope, urgency
   and degree of damage and destruction. Plan for worst-case scenarios for those natural
   disasters that could occur on or near the installation. Specific natural disasters will differ in
   scope and effects. Therefore, response, recovery and mitigation actions will vary. A national-
   level response will be required to help Air Force installations recover from extensive natural
   disasters.
   4.7.2. Natural disasters include earthquakes, extreme heat or cold, floods and flash floods,
   hurricanes or typhoons, landslides and mudflows, thunderstorms and lightning, tornadoes,
   straight-line winds (see Attachment 1 for definition), cyclones, tsunamis, volcanoes,
   wildland fires, avalanches, winter storms, and natural outbreaks of disease.
   4.7.3. Installations use the CAT and EOC for C2 of resources when responding to and
   recovering from natural disasters. MAJCOM may deploy personnel and other resources to
   support installations affected by natural disasters when requested and directed. Commanders
   must be able to maintain the primary installation mission, account for all personnel according
   to AFI 36-3803, Personnel Accountability in Conjunction with Natural Disasters or National
   Emergencies, save lives, mitigate damage, and restore mission-essential resources and
   infrastructure after a natural disaster. Base the level of response and actions on the magnitude
   of the disaster and degree of damage. Additional natural disaster guidance is defined in
   AFMAN 10-2504.
   4.7.4. Natural Disaster Phases of Incident Management.
       4.7.4.1. Prevention. Most natural disasters cannot be prevented. Vaccination of personnel
       or the use of mass prophylaxis may prevent the spread of naturally occurring disease to
       installation personnel. For other disasters, installations can only take measures aimed at
       mitigating the effects of natural disasters. These measures are addressed under
       preparedness or mitigation.
       4.7.4.2. Preparedness. Natural disaster preparedness includes any actions taken in
       anticipation of a natural disaster such as implementing the IEMP 10-2, Annex B, and
       appropriate Appendices. Training and exercises are critical elements of natural disaster
       preparedness and should be emphasized at all levels. Commanders and staff agency
       chiefs must ensure procedures are developed for personnel notification, recall, and
       accounting. They also must implement actions to protect resources and report injuries and
       damage. Units should integrate protective measures into the installation's overall
       preparedness for a natural disaster. Examples of actions to take include implementing
       weather watch, advisory and warning notifications and resulting protective actions,
       initiating treatment activities during natural outbreaks of disease, preparing installation
       housing residents to evacuate, and developing MAAs with local civil authorities. The EM
       information program makes an important contribution to preparedness by emphasizing
       actions that installation personnel can take on their own such as hardening, securing,
       dispersing, and evacuation preparations.
66                                  AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014


     4.7.4.3. Response. As with major accidents, natural disaster response has three
     overlapping phases: notification, response and evacuation.
         4.7.4.3.1. The notification phase consists of actions taken in anticipation of a natural
         disaster. Actions may not be executable if a natural disaster occurs with little or no
         warning. During the notification phase, establish C2, notify the installation populace
         and response agencies, protect materials and facilities, consider sheltering or
         evacuating personnel, coordinate with civil authorities and begin collecting data for
         reports.
         4.7.4.3.2. During response, maintain C2, assess damage, conduct fire fighting,
         conduct search and rescue, prevent illness and injury, care for casualties, establish
         cordons, protect property, restore utilities and communications and continue
         collecting data for reports.
         4.7.4.3.3. Evacuation is defined in Attachment 1. Evacuation of aircraft before a
         hurricane often precedes the evacuation of installation personnel due to the
         arrangements that must be made at the receiving installation for the evacuating
         aircraft. People are also evacuated due to floods, forest fires and other natural
         disasters.
     4.7.4.4. Recovery. The recovery phase for natural disasters consists of actions taken after
     emergency actions have been implemented and lifesaving actions have been completed.
     All installation agencies may be involved in installation recovery following natural
     disasters. Recovery efforts restore the area and operations to normal conditions. Recovery
     may involve dividing the installation into sectors and assigning each unit a sector for
     recovery actions if a natural disaster affects the entire installation. The EOC develops and
     implements a recovery plan that the Installation Commander approves. Desired outcomes
     of the recovery phase are to reestablish mission capability, prepare to handle personnel
     and claims actions, return to normal operations and provide necessary reports.
     4.7.4.5. Mitigation. Natural disasters can create emergency conditions that vary widely
     in scope, urgency and degree of damage. Installations must establish procedures and
     identify or obtain material to protect their resources from susceptible threats. Installations
     should pre-plan to isolate or shut off utilities, fuel and electrical and water systems that
     are affected by the natural disaster on or near the installation.
  4.7.5. Specific natural disaster responses will be required for the natural disasters listed in
  paragraph 4.7.2 Natural disaster responses may be modified during expeditionary
  operations.
     4.7.5.1. Consider the overall situation and threat when responding to natural disasters
     during expeditionary operations. Mission requirements and available resources will
     dictate procedures and priorities. Use the minimum resources possible to respond to the
     natural disaster and its effects without impairing mission capability. See Attachment 1
     for definitions of expeditionary operations and expeditionary units.
     4.7.5.2. The Installation Commander decides whether to evacuate or to shelter-in-place.
     4.7.5.3. Commanders of expeditionary operations must coordinate evacuation planning
     at the local, theater and DOS levels.
AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014                                                    67


4.8. Contingency and Wartime Attack with Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear,
and High-Yield Explosive (CBRNE) Weapons (referred to hereafter as CBRNE Attack).
   4.8.1. All units must develop contingency plans and conduct training and exercises for both
   their home station and their deployment location. They must develop plans, training,
   contingency response checklists and exercises based upon a realistic threat and assessment of
   resources that will be available in a contingency. Naturally occurring disease outbreaks, such
   as pandemic influenza, may create operational challenges similar to those of a biological
   attack, while also presenting unique circumstances. Response actions will be similar for both
   situations. Plans, training, and response checklists and exercises must take these
   circumstances into account. Deliberate plans that rely upon in-place resources, such as a
   hardened facility or collective protection facilities, may not be executable at austere
   locations, especially during the response and recovery phases. Units must train and exercise
   their forces to develop alternate methods or work-around procedures if critical resources are
   destroyed or if mutual-aid resources, host nation support or incoming forces are unavailable.
   4.8.2. The CBRNE attack threat may come from traditional CBRNE weapons or may be new
   compounds and organisms. Military involvement to advance and protect US interests may
   include war operations, peace operations, homeland defense and civil support, foreign
   humanitarian assistance and other DSCA. Commanders must consider the impacts of a
   potential adversary's CBRNE abilities in the geographic region. Attacks can come from a
   wide array of conventional or asymmetrical threats, including missiles, artillery, mortar,
   unmanned aerial vehicles, Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIED), IEDs,
   vehicle sprayers, backpack sprayers, aircraft, or ground forces. Adversaries may use CBRNE
   weapons and other materials in a widespread manner or in a limited, focused manner to
   achieve specific effects.
      4.8.2.1. The AFOSI and intelligence communities conduct local threat assessments
      annually, when significant threat changes occur and before deployments.
      4.8.2.2. Each installation must conduct vulnerability assessments IAW AFI 10-245.
      Forces that are deployed as part of a fragmented UTC should be briefed on the most
      recent deployed location vulnerability assessment.
      4.8.2.3. Annual reviews of the passive defense and consequence management programs
      may require adjustments to installation operations. Changes in threats or vulnerability
      assessments may also require revisions in planning and operations.
      4.8.2.4. JP 3-11, Joint Doctrine for Operations in Nuclear, Biological and Chemical
      (NBC) Environments, provides a framework to assess the threat posed by an adversary
      possessing, or suspected of possessing, CBRN weapons.
   4.8.3. Installation Commanders must provide the maximum possible protection for assigned
   personnel, materiels, equipment and facilities against the effects of enemy attacks.
      4.8.3.1. Commanders must develop a plan appropriate to their mission and threat, such
      as the installation In-Garrison Expeditionary Support Plan (IGESP) or the IEMP 10-2.
      For example, during an increased alert, unit commanders recall or provide instructions to
      personnel away from their home duty station. Commanders must develop plans that allow
      them to complete that recall in the most effective manner possible.
68                                 AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014


     4.8.3.2. CBRNE passive defense measures are designed to improve the capability of
     personnel to survive and sustain operations in CBRNE environments. The major elements
     are contamination avoidance, protection and contamination control.
     4.8.3.3. Protective actions are taken in stages equal to the immediacy and nature of the
     threat. Use MAJCOM and local instructions and the installation notification and warning
     systems to direct the proper protective posture. When there is strategic warning of an
     increased attack threat, forces will increase defense readiness IAW declared theater alert
     states and stages.
  4.8.4. CBRNE Attack Phases of Incident Management.
     4.8.4.1. Prevention. The EM Program cannot prevent CBRNE attacks. The only
     measures that help mitigate the consequences of CBRNE attacks are more appropriately
     addressed under preparedness, recovery, response and mitigation.
     4.8.4.2. Preparedness. Responders must be trained within their areas of responsibility to
     employ PPE, determine the extent of contamination, control entry and exit to contain the
     spread of contamination, decontaminate their own personnel and equipment, conduct
     mass decontamination, evacuate casualties and initiate recovery operations. They must
     participate in training and exercises to incorporate CBRNE response capabilities into
     ongoing operations. The Installation Commander should ensure that existing base shelters
     and facility shelter plans are evaluated to implement shelter in-place protection. Another
     example of preparedness for terrorist use of CBRNE is to inspect and maintain CBRNE
     response equipment and supplies to ensure they are ready for immediate use.
        4.8.4.2.1. Many actions help prepare forces for operations in CBRNE threat areas.
        Such actions require a readiness strategy designed to train, equip and exercise forces
        to counter the expected threats. This strategy includes training and equipping
        personnel, identifying shortfalls and limiting factors and developing or reviewing
        installation and joint support plans.
        4.8.4.2.2. The EM program must integrate with other efforts, such as physical
        security, critical infrastructure protection and preventive medicine, to provide the
        total force preparedness against all threats. Other examples of necessary steps include
        assigning areas of responsibility for PAR teams or establishing environmental and
        medical baselines for the installation such as those required by AFI 41-106, Medical
        Readiness Program Management; and AFI 48-102, Medical Entomology Program.
     4.8.4.3. Response. Actions taken before, during and after the attack are critical to force
     survivability and mission continuation. All personnel must know the meanings of the
     alarm conditions and MOPP levels; actions to take; where and how to take cover, how to
     report enemy sightings, provide owner-user security and wear IPE. They must perform
     self monitoring for signs and symptoms of chemical or biological exposure. Specific
     plans and procedures may be required to continue mission operations and must be
     coordinated with and supported by EM plans.
     4.8.4.4. Recovery. Successful recovery efforts require a coordinated and integrated
     approach. The recovery concept involves a combined effort from personnel trained to
     operate as a team, using specialized equipment. The EOC will provide C2 for recovery
     operations and direct team efforts for damage assessment after an attack. The commander
AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014                                                      69


      must direct actions that determine the extent of contamination and damage. Teams will
      not be released until the EOC Director and Defense Force Commander have ensured the
      installation is free of hostile activities. With advice from the EOC, the CAT must
      establish, prioritize, and direct recovery actions to restore mission capability and protect
      personnel. Only personnel involved in the recovery actions should be allowed outside
      until hazards have been identified and marked. Each unit and facility will assign and
      control PAR teams. These teams will report to their UCC, who in-turn will provide the
      reported information to the EOC.
      4.8.4.5. Mitigation. Mitigation measures against CBRNE attack include actions such as
      vulnerability and threat assessments. Mitigation also includes developing and testing the
      shelter program to provide the best available physical protection for personnel from the
      effects of an attack. As with all incidents, an important form of mitigation includes
      developing and implementing response plans, checklists and operating instructions. Also
      common to all mitigation efforts is the requirement to train and equip personnel,
      including specialized teams.
      4.8.4.6. The AFIMS structure will be used for a CBRNE incident response by Air Force
      units at home station and expeditionary operating locations. The IEMP 10-2 provides
      checklists for shelter operations. The CBRNE attack checklist provides common tasks for
      the CBRNE material and conventional attack response.
4.9. Terrorist Use of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and High-Yield Explosive
(CBRNE) Materials, Including Toxic Industrial Chemicals or Toxic Industrial Materials
(TIC/ TIM).
   4.9.1. Terrorism, IAW the NRP, is "...any activity that involves an act that is dangerous to
   human life or potentially destructive of critical infrastructure or key resources; and is a
   violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State or other subdivision of the
   United States. This act appears to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; to
   influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or to affect the conduct of a
   government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping".
   4.9.2. Terrorist use of CBRNE materials is separated from CBRNE warfare because of the
   legal requirements for handling the terrorist incident as a crime scene and preserving
   evidence. All responders will be under close scrutiny and must be aware of evidence
   collection and preservation requirements. They must also be aware of the need to follow
   peacetime rules and regulations such as OSHA standards.
   4.9.3. Each installation is required to conduct vulnerability assessments annually IAW AFI
   10-245. The assessment must include the installation’s vulnerability to terrorist use of
   CBRNE materials.
   4.9.4. Terrorist Use of CBRNE Phases of Incident Management.
      4.9.4.1. Prevention. The EM Program cannot prevent terrorist use of CBRNE. The only
      measures that help mitigate the consequences of such attacks are more appropriately
      addressed under preparedness, recovery, response and mitigation..
      4.9.4.2. Preparation. Preparation for terrorist use of CBRNE parallels those actions listed
      in paragraph 4.8.4.2 Terrorist use of CBRNE materials is separated from CBRNE
 70                                  AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014


       warfare because of the legal requirements for handling the terrorist incident as a crime
       scene and preserving evidence. This separation must be accounted for during planning,
       training, and equipping activities.
       4.9.4.3. Response. Response to terrorist use of CBRNE requires many of the same
       response actions as other types of incidents; however, responders must also establish and
       maintain a chain of custody for evidence preservation as directed by the IC. Responders
       must be alert for physical indicators and other outward warning signs of additional
       CBRNE events, including armed assault. Also, they must consider the potential for
       secondary attack, such as chemical dispersal devices, secondary explosive devices or
       booby traps.
       4.9.4.4. Recovery. Throughout the recovery phase, responders must continue to ensure
       that evidence is preserved. They may need to relinquish authority to the FBI or other
       authority for evidence collection or crime scene preservation, although lifesaving
       activities will always have priority over these actions. A mission recovery plan will be
       developed according to the IEMP 10-2. Recovery plans and programs include mitigation
       components designed to avoid damage from future incidents. Long-term recovery may
       include cleanup and restoration.
       4.9.4.5. Mitigation. Mitigation occurs throughout preparedness, prevention, response and
       recovery. Responders must develop operational and tactical safety and security plans.
       The installation must conduct and update the vulnerability assessment IAW AFI 10-245.
       The EOC must be prepared to deploy resources in response to specific threats or potential
       incidents. Another form of mitigation is ongoing educational activities designed to reduce
       loss of life and destruction of property.
4.10. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) Control Center. The CBRN
Control Center is managed under ESF 5, Emergency Management. The control center is
subordinate to the EOC director and serves as an advisory element to the EOC and the
Installation Commander. The control center directs CBRN reconnaissance activities to shape the
hazards and advises the commander on hazards, countermeasures and protective actions. The
CBRN Control Center plots and maintains CBRN hazards status on the airbase, in off-base areas
of operational concern and at potential recovery bases. The CBRN Control Center also conducts
CBRN and release other than attack (ROTA) plotting and reporting activities according to AF
Tactic, Technique, Procedure (Interservice) (AFTTP(I)) 3-2.56, Multi-service Tactics,
Techniques and Procedures for CBRN Contamination Avoidance or according to MAJCOM
guidance. These activities facilitate force survivability and mission continuation for forces on
and off the installation, both in the hazard area and in the downwind hazard area. The CBRN
Control Center manages SMT, CCA and CCT operations and supports installation warning and
reporting and operations with United States joint service, coalition and host nation forces. CBRN
Control Center personnel coordinate with medical, bioenvironmental, intelligence, and weather
representatives to provide advice to the commander. The control center may include host nation
CBRN defense specialists and may provide reciprocal manning at the host nation control center.

                                         Chapter 5

     AIR FORCE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (EM) PROGRAM LOGISTICS

5.1. Purpose. This chapter provides Air Force EM program logistics information. Information
includes policy and guidance for funding, obtaining, and maintaining equipment and supplies to
support the Air Force EM program. It also provides information specific to use of AS,
installation EM response equipment, IPE, PPE, equipment storage and equipment funding, and
reporting.
5.2. General Information. Equipment must be available to mitigate incidents, restore, and
sustain mission operations, and train for EM situations. COCOM, MAJCOM, and installation
plans will identify types and quantities of EM equipment and supplies needed for each
employment area. Equipment is required for installation response functions such as the EOC and
UCCs, specialized teams, and individuals. Equipment, including communications equipment,
should be compatible with and interoperable with on-base and off-base agencies.
5.3. Allowance Standards (AS). An AS lists prescribed items and quantities of equipment that
can be purchased and made available for EM. Expendable and supply catalog items are not listed
in allowance standards. In addition, some CBRNE defense equipment items are being processed
into AS and are not yet listed. The UTC Equipment and Supply List (ESL) identifies the
prescribed equipment items and quantities authorized to support home-station and deployed AF
EM Program. Table 5.1, lists primary AS that prescribe equipment items and quantities
authorized to support the Air Force EM programs. Applicable Medical AS listed in the 886-
series, are located on the Air Force Medical Logistics web site https://medlog.detrick.af.mil
under Medical Readiness. The MEFPAK Responsible Agent maintains the AS for medical
emergency response equipment.

Table 5.1. Non-Medical Allowance Standards (AS) for Emergency Management (EM)
Supplies and Equipment.
               Allowance
                         Title
               Standard
           1. AS 016C      Chemical Warfare Defense Equipment (clothing and textiles)
           2. AS 019       Vehicles
           3. AS 459       CBRN equipment
           4. AS 538       Small Arms and SF equipment
           5. AS 660       Communications equipment

   5.3.1. To determine equipment needs, evaluate the installation or unit mission and threat;
   then purchase only the material needed to respond to that threat. Maintain spare parts for
   user-level maintenance. Base stock levels on anticipated consumption during scheduled
   maintenance, EM operations, training, and exercises.
   5.3.2. Needs may fall into various categories such as mobility, C2, EOC, UCC, team, and
   individual capabilities such as shelter management or detection. Installations may not stock
 72                                 AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014


   supplies solely for the purpose of DSCA, as directed in DODD 3025.15, unless otherwise
   directed by the SecDef.
5.4. Installation Emergency Management (EM) Response Equipment. The Installation
Commander will ensure that all responders have adequate EM response equipment to respond to
any incident that threatens the installation. MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs may specify minimum
equipment requirements for subordinate units. Installations must budget for, acquire, and
maintain equipment for natural disasters, major accidents or incidents, and response on or off
base.
   5.4.1. The CE Readiness Flight and the CBRNE Medical Defense Officer will address the
   status of installation EM response equipment, both medical and non-medical, at the EMWG
   meeting. Before the meeting, the CE Readiness Flight will review the consolidated list of
   non-medical EM response equipment requirements, then present this list to the EMWG. The
   EMWG will then prioritize the list for approval and inclusion in installation budget
   submissions. The EMWG will monitor funding allocation and acquisition to ensure the
   installation EM capability is subsequently established.
   5.4.2. The CBRNE Medical Defense Officer will provide a consolidated, prioritized list of
   EM medical equipment requirements through the EMWG to the installation FPEC. The
   medical list will be submitted to MAJCOM SG for coordination.
   5.4.3. The Installation Comptroller will coordinate the disbursement of EM program funding
   received from MAJCOM budget allocations through the EMWG to ensure funding is applied
   against the EMWG-approved consolidated non-medical EM priority equipment requirements
   list prescribed in paragraph 5.4.1
   5.4.4. Team Equipment. Some personnel assigned to teams may require additional
   specialized protective equipment for their EM missions. Use the AS or 4F9WM UTC ESL to
   validate these requirements.
   5.4.5. Command and Control Vehicles. AF installations must have mobile communications
   capabilities to support AFIMS mobile incident response command and control. Level 1, the
   minimum standard, capability would be thru assigned First Responder (Medical, Security
   Forces, and Fire and Emergency Services) vehicles with assigned tactical communications
   equipment. The Emergency Management office, as follow-on emergency responders, will
   also designate an assigned emergency response vehicle identified and equipped according to
   AFMAN 32-1007. Additional capability, if required, will be supported at the installation
   level. Emergency response command and control vehicles are considered priority vehicles
   according to AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations.
   5.4.6. CBRNE Incident Response Equipment. 4F9W-series UTCs support typical non-
   medical CBRNE incident equipment requirements for a response to terrorist use of CBRNE
   events. UTC 4F9WM is designed for home station CBRNE response, as such the UTC
   should not be palletized or tasked to deploy for inspections or exercises. The equipment
   listed in each UTC ESL builds upon existing HAZMAT team equipment. This equipment
   allows response teams to continue limited mission operations and to restore mission
   capabilities following a terrorist use of CBRNE event. Assigned UTC equipment must be
   properly inventoried and accounted for using supply accountability procedures outlined in
   AFMAN 23-110. Detailed guidance for accountability will be contained in supporting
AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014                                                    73


   manuals to this AFI. Medical UTC CBRNE Incident Response Equipment detailed guidance
   and accountability procedures are outlined in AFI 41-106 and AFI 41-209, Medical Logistics
   Support.
   5.4.7. War reserve materiel (WRM) can be used to support domestic incidents, but approval
   will be obtained from the WRM releasing authority IAW AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel
   (WRM) Program Guidance and Procedures. When WRM is used to support domestic
   incidents, notify the approving authority as soon as possible.
5.5. Unit Emergency Management (EM) Response Equipment. Unit commanders must
identify requirements then budget for, obtain, store, and maintain material needed to accomplish
their specific functional EM tasks in support of response plans. Unit emergency response
equipment includes items to support unit EM missions such as shelter management, PAR, and
CCA team taskings. Unit equipment does not include items issued to individuals, such as IPE.
Units will maintain the minimum materials needed for tasked response and support. Supplement
or rotate consumable supplies and shelf-life-coded equipment with day-to-day operating stocks.
   5.5.1. Unit commanders must ensure unit material, including material in bulk storage, is
   properly maintained and inventoried. Units must budget to repair and replace equipment and
   consumables based on shelf-life expiration, service-life expiration, and unserviceable
   condition. Supplement or rotate this material with day-to-day operating stocks.
   5.5.2. Units must identify and mark training equipment IAW T.O.s. Do NOT store training
   equipment with operational equipment.
5.6. Program Element (PE) Codes. Units will use the PE codes in Table 5.2, EM-Related
Program Elements, to purchase authorized EM response equipment and supplies.

Table 5.2. Emergency Management (EM)-Related Program Elements (PE).

5.7. Individual Protective Equipment (IPE) and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
   5.7.1. IPE is personal clothing and equipment required to protect an individual from
   chemical, biological, and some nuclear effects in a CBRN-warfare environment. The
   protective mask also protects the respiratory tract from radioactive particles. IPE items may,
 74                                  AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014


   but do not necessarily, meet the requirements of PPE for emergency response where
   Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or Air Force Occupational and
   Environmental Safety, Fire Protection, and Health (AFOSH) standards apply.
   5.7.2. C-1 Bag Authorizations. The R&EM Flight will use both Table 5.4, or Table 5.5, as
   applicable to consolidate information provided by the logistics plans and force support
   organizations and determine the total C-1 bag authorization. The R&EM Flight will provide
   the C-1 bag authorizations to the responsible logistics organization annually by 1 February.
   The logistics organization will use the authorizations to update C-1 bag authorizations in the
   Mobility Inventory Control and Accountability System (MICAS). According to AFI 10-403,
   add 10% to the C-1 bag authorization in Table 5.4, or Table 5.5, to identify the total C-1 bag
   authorization. Installations will procure and maintain the C-1 bag contents identified in
   Table 5.6
      5.7.2.1. C-1 Bag Authorizations for Active Duty Organizations. Determine the total
      active duty installation C-1 bag authorization by consolidating all AF assigned,
      supported, tenant and geographically separated active duty units and personnel regardless
      of MAJCOM or other unit of assignment. Use Table 5.4, for installations located in a
      CBRNE LTA. Use Table 5.5, for installations located in a CBRNE MTA or HTA. If
      additional authorizations are identified in COCOM guidance or reporting instruction, use
      the most stringent authorization.

          and for institutional forces available for sourcing in the Military Personnel Data
          System (see AFI 10-403). C-1 bags are authorized for DOD contractors that are
          deployable to MTA or HTA locations. Logistics organizations will maintain 100% of
          the authorized quantity of protective masks and 60% of the authorized quantity of the
          remaining C-1 bag contents, as listed in Table 5.4, and according to AFMAN 23-110.
          5.7.2.1.2. Active Duty MTA or HTA Installation. C-1 bags are authorized for all
          assigned AF military and emergency-essential DOD civilian and contractor
          personnel. Host-nation foreign nationals working on AF installations are authorized
          C-1 bags when identified in a Host-Nation Support Agreement or equivalent.
          Logistics organizations will maintain 100% of the authorized quantity of all C-1 bag
          contents, as listed in Table 5.4, and according to AFMAN 23-110.
      5.7.2.2. C-1 Bag Authorizations for ANG and AFRC Organizations. Use Table 5.4, to
      determine the total C-1 bag authorization for ANG and AFRC units. C-1 bags are
      authorized for military positions assigned Posturing Code A/DWX and A/DWS.
      Logistics organizations will maintain 100% of the authorized quantity of protective

       to MTAs or HTAs: C-bag items may be pre-positioned. Personnel will deploy IAW
       specific location and AOR reporting instructions. Personnel that will be TDY for 20 days
       or longer to a MTA or HTA, other than AEF locations, will bring a complete operational
       C-1 bag and related field gear, including helmet and body armor. Personnel participating
       in an MTA or HTA operations readiness exercise or inspection will bring training IPE
       components and a protective mask.
       5.7.2.4. MAJCOM A4 and A7 staffs, in coordination with MAJCOM/JA, will review
       host nation support agreements to determine if valid requirements exist to issue IPE to
       foreign nationals working on foreign Air Force installations. If valid requirements exist,
       MAJCOM A4 staffs will direct their installations’ LRS to determine and stock
       appropriate quantities of IPE. MAJCOM A4 staffs will also direct their installations to
       issue required IPE.
       5.7.2.5. Provide IPE to each United States government civilian and DOD contractor
       identified as emergency-essential and deployable to HTA or MTA areas. See DODI
       1400.31, Civilian Work Force Contingency and Emergency Planning and Execution, and
       DODI 3020.37, Continuation of Essential DOD Contractor Services During Crisis.
       5.7.2.6. LRS (or equivalent) will maintain a supply of chemical protective overgarments,
       gloves, inserts, and overboots for training and exercise purposes for participating Air
       Force military and civilian members. Use the same operational protective mask for both
       training and real-world operations. Individuals declared hard-to-fit by the
       Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight personnel during QNFT will be issued an M-45 or
       other DOD mask and spare parts for deployment.
   5.7.3. PPE is equipment designed to protect individuals exposed to hazards from injury or
   illness in non-military unique occupational environments where OSHA or AFOSH standards
   apply, including emergency response to CBRNE incidents in the United States.
       5.7.3.1. At foreign locations, PPE for emergency response operations that meets OSHA
       or AFOSH standards may be required IAW Final Governing Standards, Overseas
       Environmental Baseline Guidance, and MAJCOM or COCOM policy.
       5.7.3.2. PPE used by Air Force emergency responders must be approved by the
       installation bioenvironmental engineer or Safety personnel (IAW AFOSH standards)
       before procurement and use. Where IPE meets appropriate PPE standards, the
       bioenvironmental engineer may approve IPE use as PPE for emergency response
       operations. Conversely, responders may use PPE when MOPP conditions are declared if
       the PPE meets or exceeds IPE protection and its use has been coordinated with the
       installation bioenvironmental engineer.
       5.7.3.3. Each installation DRF team or function will determine the incident response PPE
       requirements based on supported operations and types of hazards.
5.8. Funding and Reporting. PE 27593 funding for groundcrew chemical warfare defense
equipment is centrally managed by AF/A7CX beginning in FY13. NGB/A7X manages PE 55165
and AFRC/A7X manages PE 55166 funding for their subordinate units. C-1 bag funding is
provided based on the authorizations and requirements established according to Paragraph
5.7.2, and annual funding guidance established by AF/A7CX. Installations provided funding will

6.1. Purpose. This chapter provides Air Force EM program education and training policy and
guidance including objectives, responsibilities, requirements, and courses. Air Force EM
education and training applies to the all-hazards concept of integrating cross-functional
education and training into the Air Force EM program.
6.2. Training Objective. The objective of Air Force EM training is to provide the required
knowledge and skills to prevent, protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate
contingencies or emergencies requiring Air Force response. AETC formal courses and
installation-level training increase knowledge and proficiency for response operations. Also, Air
Force EM education and training complies with Federal, DOD, Joint, and national consensus
standards in meeting training levels, frequency, and comprehensiveness.
6.2. (TINKERAFB)Installation personnel appointed to the Crisis Action Team, Emergency
Operations Center, Emergency Support Function, Unit Control Center, Unit Emergency
Management representative, or wing inspection team will: complete training requirements
identified in AFI 10-2501 within 60 days of appointment.
6.3. Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Education and Training Policy. The target
audience for Air Force EM education and training includes personnel specified in Table 6.1, Air
Force Incident Management System Education and Training Requirements, Table 6.2, Air Force
Emergency Management (EM) Program Education and Training Courses, and Table 6.4,
HAZMAT Minimum Training and Certification Requirements. Personnel will attend the courses
listed in the tables to meet the level of proficiency needed to accomplish their assigned tasks.
6.4. Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Education and Training
Requirements.
   6.4.1. Only military, civilian, or contractor personnel who complete the AETC Readiness
   Apprentice Course or CE Readiness Flight Officer Course may instruct courses listed in
   paragraph 6.6, unless otherwise specified. These instructors must be task certified and the
   certification documented annually by a CE Readiness Technician IAW AFI 36-2201,
   Volume 3. Military task certification is documented on AF Form 1098, Special Task
   Certification and Recurring Training and placed in the trainee’s AF Form 623, OJT Record.
   Civilian task certification will be documented in the employee’s records IAW AFI 36-401,
   Employee Training and Development, and contractors’ task certification will be documented
   IAW their contract or corporate requirements. New contracts for contracted CE Readiness
   Flight positions that include instructor duties must require completion of the AETC
   Readiness Apprentice Course or CE Readiness Flight Officer Course. Newly hired
   contractors must complete training before instructing or as soon as possible. Contractors
   hired prior to the effective date of this requirement must obtain this training as soon as
   possible to continue instructing.

6.5. Education and Training Program Formats. Most courses in this chapter are currently
conducted and evaluated in a traditional instructor-led classroom or field environment. However,
Air Force EM education and training is transitioning to blended learning. Blended learning
includes two distinctive parts: individual knowledge-based objectives and individual
demonstration-performance objectives. The use of blended learning standardizes education and
training objectives and increases student retention and comprehension.
   6.5.1. Individual knowledge-based objectives use Learning Management System (LMS)
   technologies via the web to deliver consistent, up-to-date education and training. This format
   allows academic self-paced learning and provides students increased access to course
   materials. Use of these technologies also allows for critical education and training data
   analysis at the installation and Air Force levels. Until each course is fielded, instructors will
AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014                                                  87


  use the course proficiency standards for knowledge and performance outlined in the Air
  Force Readiness Training Packages (RTP).
     6.5.1.1. Completion of computer-based Air Force EM education and training products
     for courses discussed in this chapter becomes mandatory as they are fielded and IAW the
     accompanying product implementation guidance.
     6.5.1.2. Current CD-formatted Air Force EM education and training products are
     mandatory to complete until products are transitioned to a web-delivered format.
     6.5.1.3. A listing of fielded EM education and training products is located on the Air
     Force Portal. Web-delivered products can be found at https://golearn.csd.disa.mil/.
     6.5.1.4. (DELETED) .
     6.5.1.5. Each individual must create an account on the Air Force EM program LMS site
     from a computer with military internet access. Once an account is created, EM education
     and training products can be accessed and completed from any computer with internet
     access.
     6.5.1.6. Personnel who need assistance determining course requirements, accessing
     course material, addressing technical issues, or have questions concerning EM training
     products should contact their Unit EM Representative, CE Readiness Flight or the HQ
     AFCESA Reach Back Center at DSN 523-6995 or 1-888-AFCESA1 (888-232-3721).
     Frequently asked questions concerning EM training products can be found on the Air
     Force Portal or on the Air Force EM program LMS site.
     6.5.1.7. Individual knowledge-based objectives must be completed within 15 consecutive
     days of start by active duty military, civilian, or contract personnel or within two Unit
     Training Assemblies (UTA) by ARC personnel. Group or team completion of individual
     knowledge-based objectives is not authorized.
  6.5.2. Individual demonstration-performance objectives focus on common core skills. After
  a student completes the knowledge-based objectives, CE Readiness Flight instructors will
  train and evaluate individual demonstration-performance objectives.
     6.5.2.1. Some courses listed in this chapter do not contain individual demonstration-
     performance objectives; however they contain localized procedures that must be
     presented to the individual by the CE Readiness Flight or other functional areas as
     identified in this chapter.
     6.5.2.2. Unit commanders must ensure personnel complete individual demonstration-
     performance objectives no later than 60 days after completing individual knowledge-
     based objectives.
     6.5.2.3. Duration for the demonstration-performance portion of education and training is
     approximate, based on covering Air Force standard demonstration-performance
     objectives, local procedures, and requirements. Duration is affected by student
     proficiency levels.
  6.5.3. Unless otherwise noted in this chapter, personnel do not receive credit for completing
  a course until both individual objectives have been completed.

   Representatives disseminating EM information provided by the CE Readiness Flight to
   assigned personnel.
       6.7.2.1. Media such as visual aids, handouts, posters, base bulletins, electronic media,
       and base newspapers should be used. HQ AFCESA will develop standard AF visual aids
       as new publications are created. Until these standard visual aids are published
       MAJCOMs or installations are authorized to create their own and use for their specific
       threat requirements.
       6.7.2.2. The CE Readiness Flight disseminates this information at least quarterly to unit
       EM Representatives.
       6.7.2.3. Using localized procedures, the R&EM Flight will record what information was
       distributed and when it was provided. The unit EM Representative will record who
       received the information.
6.8. Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Education and Training.
   6.8.1. Personnel must meet the training requirements specified in Table 6.4. The DOD
   HAZMAT certification program is based on the 2008 Edition of National Fire Protection
   Association Standard 472, Competence of Responders to Hazardous Materials/Weapons of
   Mass Destruction Incidents and consists of HAZMAT Awareness, HAZMAT Operations
   with Mission Specific Competencies (MSCs), Technician and IC training. Note: Security
   Forces and Medical emergency responders will use 29 CFR 1910.120q training requirements
   to train their personnel to respond to CBRNE incidents. They do not require DOD
   certification but are eligible to become DOD certified if they complete the required DOD
   training courses.

Note 2: Course training depends on team duties. If a team operates in a warm zone because of
mission requirements, train to the Operations level. All other MCRP teams, to include
Manpower/Security team members, not performing duties in the patient decontamination warm
zone require only Awareness-level training.
Note 3: HAZMAT Awareness is completed through computer based training. Upon individual
completion DOD certification obtained.
Note 4: Ambulance Services (Field Response Team) not assigned to FES require Enhanced
Awareness-level training.
    6.8.2. The Air Force, as the employer, have two approved training methods to satisfy the
    HAZMAT training and DOD certification levels listed in National Fire Protection
    Association (NFPA) Standard 472. These two methods are:
       6.8.2.1. Web-Based Training.
           6.8.2.1.1. HAZMAT Awareness Training: Students can access and complete this
           course using the AFCEC VLC at https://afcesa.csd.disa.mil/kc/login/login.asp. This
           course is considered complete when the student finishes the required course training
           modules and passes the required computer-based final exam and completes the
           performance tests that are built right into the course. Any DOD employee who
           completes this training course will become DOD certified at the HAZMAT
           Awareness level.
           6.8.2.1.2. HAZMAT Operations with MSCs, Technician, and IC Training: These
           courses require the employee to formally enroll and complete the Career
           Development Courses (CDC) through the Air University Directorate of Education
           Logistics and Communication, A4/6 (formerly the Air Force Institute for Advanced
           Distributed Learning). Enrollment procedures are listed in the course catalog located
           at http://www.au.af.mil/au/afiadl/. The course numbers for these courses are
           47202W for HAZMAT Operations with the MSCs, 47203W for HAZMAT
           Technician and 47205W for the HAZMAT IC course. Once the student enrolls in the
           course, they can access and complete the applicable course using the GoLearn web
           site powered by the ADLS at https://golearn.csd.disa.mil/kc/login/login.asp. These
           courses are considered complete when the student completes the required course
           training modules, takes and passes the required CDC final exam at an official A4/6
           test control facility, completes the required performance test evaluations at the local
           level and becomes DOD certified. The Air Force FES Flight administers all
           performance test evaluations for the HAZMAT Operations, Technician and IC
           certification levels. Any DOD employee who completes these training courses is
           eligible to become DOD certified. Note: HAZMAT Awareness is a prerequisite for
           the HAZMAT Operations level and HAZMAT Operations is a prerequisite for the
           HAZMAT Technician and/or HAZMAT IC levels.
           6.8.2.1.3. HAZMAT Operations MSCs: In the 2008 Edition of NFPA Standard 472
           there are eight MSCs: Technical Decontamination, Mass Decontamination, Product
AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014                                                  103


         Control, Air Monitoring and Sampling, Victim Rescue and Recovery, Evidence
         Preservation and Sampling, Response to Illicit Laboratories and PPE. Completion of
         all, some, or none of these MSCs is left solely up to the employer or based on the
         expected tasks and duties the employee is expected to perform. In the DOD, the
         HAZMAT Operations Core course includes the PPE MSC. The PPE MSC was
         incorporated into the DOD core course because emergency responders cannot
         perform their required hands-on HAZMAT Operations tasks without first having a
         basic knowledge and understanding of the PPE they are required to wear.
         Additionally, PPE is a required prerequisite for the other seven MSCs. The HAZMAT
         Operations CDC final exam covers only the HAZMAT Operations Core and PPE
         portions of the course. Employees deciding to complete some, or all the MSCs will
         take the applicable MSC final exam(s) using the FES Flight or Emergency
         Management Flight’s version of the Certification Test (CerTest) computer-based
         testing program before completing the required performance tests.
         6.8.2.1.4. HAZMAT Operations MSCs:             DOD employees who are already
         HAZMAT Operations certified and want or need to specialize in one, some, or all the
         HAZMAT Operations MSCs; can access and complete the applicable MSCs using the
         AFCEC VLC at https://afcesa.csd.disa.mil/kc/login/login.asp without formally
         enrolling in the course as stated above in paragraph 6.8.2.1.2. The applicable MSCs
         are considered finished when the student completes the required course-training
         module, takes and passes the required CerTest computer-based final exam, and
         completes the required performance test evaluations at the local level and becomes
         DOD certified.
     6.8.2.2. Reciprocity. The DOD certification program recognizes and accepts certification
     certificates from any entity accredited by the International Fire Service Accreditation
     Congress (IFSAC) or the Pro-Board only when the DOD employee has satisfied the
     required prerequisite certification level(s). Employees who have completed IFSAC or
     Pro-Board accredited training programs may request DOD equivalent certification
     certificates under the reciprocity provision of the certification program. The certificates
     being submitted for reciprocity must have the appropriate IFSAC or Pro-Board seal on
     them. The DOD certification program does not issue DOD certification certificates for
     completing non-accredited training.
     6.8.2.3. (DELETED)
     6.8.2.4. (DELETED)
  6.8.3. According to 29 CFR 1910.120q, HAZMAT training is based on the duties and
  functions to be performed by each emergency responder. The required training is defined in
  Table 6.4
     6.8.3.1. Each course requires initial skills and annual refresher training. To comply with
     federal regulations, annual refresher training requires the employee to demonstrate
     competency and/or maintain proficiency at least annually.
         6.8.3.1.1. Refresher training can be satisfied by completing formal training courses,
         in-service training, participating in real-world emergency responses, or by
         participating in training exercises or a combination of these methods.
 104                                 AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014


          6.8.3.1.2. When refresher training is accomplished through real-world emergency
          responses or exercises, the training documentation must include a summary of the
          person’s response that meets the criteria for the appropriate training level, including
          each competency training level listed in 29 CFR 1910.120q.
          6.8.3.1.3. Supervisors and specialized team chiefs must document annual HAZMAT
          refresher training at the local level in the employee’s training record and certify that
          the employee is competent to perform their assigned duties.

   military or government civilian employees filling equivalent positions, and as defined by the
   contract. Contractor training is determined as specified in the contract statement of work or
   specifications. DOD contractors are eligible to take the DOD web-based training courses and
   become DOD certified while they work directly for the federal government.
   6.8.5. Unless exempted in paragraph 6.8.1, initial HAZMAT training will use the DOD
   HAZMAT certification program.
       6.8.5.1. (DELETED)
       6.8.5.2. (DELETED)
   6.8.6. Personnel responding to a HAZMAT or CBRNE incident must be trained and current
   for the positions identified in Table 6.4.

                                            Chapter 8

               CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT AND REPORT PROCEDURES

8.1. Purpose. This chapter establishes guidance for assessing and reporting Air Force EM
capabilities on a routine, pre-incident basis and reporting of actual response when incidents
occur. Reporting is mandated by AFI 10-201, AFI 10-204, Participation in Joint and National
Exercises; and AFI 10-206. Some units use the AEF Reporting Tool (ART), following guidance
in AFI 10-244, Reporting Status of Aerospace Expeditionary Forces, to report Unit Type Code
(UTC) status reporting and AEF certification.
8.2. Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Capability Reports. The Installation
Commander uses monthly SORTS reports and annual Radiological Response Capability Reports
to report the installation’s overall capability to respond to the installation deployment mission or
support a radiological response. The commander must assess installation resources, augmenting
resources, and critical capabilities available through MAAs or commercial sources. The
combination of these resources should assist the installation in more closely achieving maximum
response capability.
   8.2.1. SORTS Reporting. Commanders at all levels must use measurement tools for
   assessing the strength and effectiveness of their EM program. Although SORTS reports are
   not EM-specific, the data needed to complete the SORTS reports make SORTS reporting a
   tool that can be used to support the Air Force EM program. SORTS reporting is based on
   continuous monitoring of changes in the overall unit level, resource category levels, and unit
   locations. Units must report no later than every 30 days or when changes affect the unit’s
   overall rating. To obtain the resources necessary for successful mission accomplishment,
   personnel at every level must report the program status with specific justifications. AFI 10-
   201 provides the requirements for reporting this information and further details.
   8.2.2. Interagency Combating WMD Database of Responsibilities, Authorities, and
   Capabilities Report (INDRAC).
       8.2.2.1. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency, along with USSTRATCOM, is
       responsible for maintaining a listing of organization records of Combating Weapons of
       Mass Destruction responsibilities, authorities, and capabilities.
       8.2.2.2. INDRAC website serves as the central repository for vital information on DOD
       Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction capabilities, assets, and units to assist in
       planning and conducting DOD CBRN-CM operations.
8.3. Reports. The Installation Commander uses OPREP-3 and Situation Report (SITREP)
reports to report the installation’s overall EM response to incidents such as terrorist use of
CBRNE and DSCA support and severe weather events. See AFI 10-206 for the required
reporting procedures.
   8.3.1. Event/Incident Report (OPREP-3). OPREP-3 reports use command post channels to
   immediately notify commanders of any event or incident that may attract international,
   national, US Air Force, or significant news media interest. Submit the OPREP-3 regardless
   of whether or not the event is being reported through other channels. AFI 10-206 details eight
AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014                                                    109


   categories of OPREP-3 reports to help users determine the type of report to submit. CBRNE
   incidents, including HAZMAT releases, are reported using OPREP-3 reports.
   8.3.2. Commander's SITREP. SITREP reports keep the Joint Staff, Services, and SecDef
   apprised of existing political, military, and operational situations and plans. SITREPS also
   advise commanders of a units ability to meet requirements outlined in approved plans. DSCA
   is reported through SITREP reports whether or not the support was covered by an MAA.
   8.3.3. Installation Emergency Managers will notify their respective MAJCOMs and
   AFCEC/CXR within 24 hours whenever the installation EOC is activated for a real-world
   incident or event. Information will be up channeled using ICS Form 213, General Message
   Form.
8.4. After-Action Reports. Procedures for after-actions reports are provided in AFI 10-204.
Commanders must send an installation-wide lessons-learned report to their MAJCOM, FOA, or
DRU for all emergency responses. After-action reports should include actions implemented and
any lessons learned during actual incident response and exercises.
   8.4.1. Reports must be submitted within 14 days after the incident. The report must include
   dissemination and notification successes and shortfalls, installation-wide response checklists,
   deficiencies, deficiency correction plans, required training, dates of implementation, or
   corrective action, follow-up actions, and lessons learned. See AFI 10-204 for guidance on
   reportable actions, as well as preparing, and submitting the report.
   8.4.2. After-action reports are also required by the Air Force After-Actions Reporting
   System (AFAARS) when Air Force elements participate in the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
   of Staff Exercise Program, other joint exercises, Air Force exercises, and real-world
   operations. AFAARS reporting is required on humanitarian, base closure, peacekeeping, and
   Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO). Air Force, MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs
   must establish internal after-action reporting procedures that ensure AFAARS objectives are
   met, problems are solved and results are disseminated.

                                          Chapter 9

AIR FORCE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (EM) PROGRAM NOTIFICATION AND
                      WARNING SYSTEMS

9.1. Purpose. This chapter establishes policies for standardized signals and requirements for
installation notification and warning signals.
9.2. General Information. Every Air Force installation must have the capability to disseminate
rapidly and effectively the emergency information to warn all personnel immediately, but no
longer than 10 minutes after incident notification and verification. This includes signals or
messaging appropriate to Force Protection Conditions, watches, warnings, evacuation routes, and
other alerting information to meet DOD and Federal warning requirements. This must give
response direction and should incorporate all available resources such as an intelligible voice
communications, visible signals, text, text messaging, computer notification, tactile cable
override, reverse 911, or Network Broadcast System. The incorporated resources compose the
INWS, as detailed in paragraph 9.3
   9.2.1. Air Force Visual Aid (AFVA) 10-2510, USAF Emergency Notification Signals, and
   AFVA10-2511, USAF Standardized Attack Warning Signals for the United States, Its
   Territories and Possessions, provide standardized signals that must be used. These signals
   can be supplemented with signals compatible with local, national, host nation, or theater
   systems. Follow command and theater guidance when more than one system applies. Signals
   used within the United States, its territories, and possessions are compatible with those
   established by FEMA and the Homeland Security Advisory System.
   9.2.2. Display local visual aids or posters in work and rest areas. To incorporate local
   information, the overprint of AFVAs 10-2510 and 10-2511 is authorized.
   9.2.2. (TINKERAFB) EM representatives will post AFVA 10-2510, USAF Emergency
   Notification Signals, on unit’s official bulletin board.
   9.2.3. Deployable units should consult plans for specific signals used at the deployed
   locations they support. For deployments to bare base locations, the communications unit
   must provide notification and warning systems.
   9.2.4. Consider unique populations, such as the visually or hearing impaired, to ensure
   effective warning systems are in place to provide for their safety. Planners also consider the
   environment in which the system operates and ensure that all personnel can immediately hear
   or see status changes and take action. For example, voice warnings must be audible to
   personnel inside facilities and over background noise such as air conditioning units. Use
   visual warnings when audio signals interfere with operational security.
   9.2.5. Use DOD-required individual building Mass Notification Systems (MNS) to
   disseminate EM information. MNS will be installed in most new and renovated buildings to
   meet DOD AT requirements. Comply with DOD Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-010-01,
   DOD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings and UFC 4-021-01, Design and
   O&M: Mass Notification Systems.
9.3. Installation Notification and Warning System (INWS). The INWS is a combination of
methods using audible and visual signals, verbal messages, and electronic communication.
AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014                                                    111


Communication modes include sirens, horns, radio tone alerting, MNS, unaided voice systems,
public and broadcast address systems, local area network messaging, telephone alert
conferencing, pagers, television, radio, flags, signs, and other electronic or mechanical methods.
See UFC 4-021-01 for details about warning standards.
   9.3.1. CE and Communications Squadrons will design warning systems for operation
   throughout disaster conditions. The system must be redundant, hardened, or splinter-
   protected, and operate using both commercial and emergency power. Incorporate existing
   networks into this system.
   9.3.2. The INWS must:
       9.3.2.1. Provide installation-wide coverage of outdoor areas, indoor facilities, housing,
       and separated sites.
       9.3.2.2. Reach off-base facilities that are controlled or owned by the installation to
       ensure coverage for personnel working or billeted in those areas.
       9.3.2.3. Incorporate DOD-required MNS into the indoor coverage.
           9.3.2.3.1. Design outdoor INWS voice signals to be intelligible to personnel.
           9.3.2.3.2. Consider the use of directional-type loudspeakers to minimize the
           distortion caused by overlapping voice signals.
       9.3.2.4. Incorporate systematic and coordinated standard to support the AFIMS,
       including protocols for:
           9.3.2.4.1. Initial and follow-on emergency responder and senior leader incident
           notification.
           9.3.2.4.2. Coordinated action for single or multiple incidents.
           9.3.2.4.3. Initiation of pre-planned and incident-specific actions by units, teams and
           individuals, and off-base responders.
           9.3.2.4.4. Alert, notification, and warning of 100 percent of units and personnel and
           units under installation responsibility.
           9.3.2.4.5. Operating under differing FPCONs and Alarm Conditions.
           9.3.2.4.6. Integration of crisis and consequence management functions.
       9.3.2.5. Provide mechanisms for vertical and horizontal coordination, communications,
       and information sharing in response to threats or incidents.
   9.3.3. Domestic locations must use installation notification and warning systems that comply
   with DHS, FEMA, and National Weather Service’s Emergency Managers Weather
   Information Network and the Emergency Alerting System alerting methods, requirements,
   and capabilities. Off-base systems are the responsibility of the city or county EM office.
   9.3.4. Foreign locations must use warning systems and signals that are compatible with
   local, host nation, or theater systems. Follow COCOM or DOS guidance when more than one
   notification and warning system may be applied or is in operation. Alert, notification, and
   warning methods must provide both overt and covert notification capability. Warning
 112                                AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014


   systems in foreign countries should broadcast voice messages in English and the predominant
   language of the local personnel working on base.
9.4. Installation Notification and Warning System (INWS) Responsibilities.
   9.4.1. Installation Commander through the CAT. The Communications Squadron ensures
   testing, activation, and maintenance are accomplished to ensure the installation populace can
   be warned of impending or occurring events. The CAT is responsible to activate and the CE
   Operations Flight is responsible for testing and maintaining individual building MNS when
   designated as real property installed equipment (RPIE). The owner or user must test,
   maintain, and activate systems that are not designated RPIE.
   9.4.2. The Installation Commander, incident commander, or other designated individual
   directs use of the system to ensure personnel safety.
   9.4.3. Command post personnel will test the INWS daily and weekly. They will also ensure
   a procedure is in place to verify each INWS location is operational. The command post will
   maintain a record of the test results. The methodology to verify the INWS can be heard at all
   locations outdoors on base must be coordinated between the command post, Communications
   Squadron, and the CE Squadron. This must be a locally developed procedure due to the
   differences in INWS systems and base topography.
   9.4.4. The Communications Squadron is responsible for coordinating new INWS
   requirements and tracking maintenance requirements on existing INWS components. The
   command post is responsible for identifying, reporting, and tracking INWS outages. The CE
   Operations Flight is responsible for maintaining existing power requirements. The
   Communications Squadron installs and maintains the INWS components that activate,
   generate, and transmit the INWS signal including speakers, sirens, and amplifiers. The CE
   Operations Flight installs and maintains individual building MNS when designated as RPIE.

Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program—The single, integrated Air Force
program to coordinate and organize efforts to prepare for, prevent, respond to, recover from, and
mitigate the direct and indirect consequences of an emergency or attack. The primary missions
of the Air Force EM program are to (1) save lives, (2) minimize the loss or degradation of
resources, and (3) continue, sustain, and restore combat and combat support operational
capability in an all-hazards physical threat environment at Air Force installations worldwide. The
ancillary missions of the Air Force EM program are to support homeland defense and civil
support operations and to provide support to civil and host nation authorities IAW DOD
directives and through the appropriate Combatant Command. The Air Force EM program is
managed by the Office of The Civil Engineer, AF/A7C.
Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS)—A methodology designed to incorporate
the requirements of HSPD-5, the NIMS, the NRP, and OSD guidance while preserving the
unique military requirements of the expeditionary Air Force. AFIMS provides the Air Force
with an incident management system that is consistent with the single, comprehensive approach
to domestic incident management. AFIMS provides the Air Force with the coordinating
structures, processes, and protocols required to integrate its specific authorities into the collective
framework of Federal departments and agencies for action to include mitigation, prevention,
preparedness, response, and recovery activities. It includes a core set of concepts, principles,
terminology, and technologies covering the incident command system, EOCs, incident
command, training, identification and management of resources, qualification and certification,
and the collection, tracking and reporting of incident information and incident resources. The
AFIMS methodology is incorporated into current operating practices through revised instructions
and manuals, training products, and exercise and evaluation tools.
Antiterrorism (AT)—Defensive measures used to reduce the vulnerability of individuals and
property to terrorist acts, to include limited response and containment by local military and
civilian forces. See also AFI 10-245.
Area of Responsibility (AOR)—The geographical area associated with a COCOM within
which a combatant commander has authority to plan and conduct operations.
Avoidance—Individual and/or unit measures taken by individuals or units to avoid or minimize
CBRN attacks and reduce the effects of CBRN hazards.
Awareness—The continual process of collecting, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence,
information, and knowledge to allow organizations and individuals to anticipate requirements
and to react effectively.
Bare Base—A base having minimum essential facilities to house, sustain, and support
operations to include, if required, a stabilized runway, taxiways, and aircraft parking areas. A
bare base must have a source of water that can be made potable. Other requirements to operate
under bare base conditions form a necessary part of the force package deployed to the bare base.
Biological Agent—A microorganism that causes disease in personnel, plants, or animals or
causes the deterioration of material.
Biological Threat—A threat that consists of biological material planned to be deployed to
produce casualties in personnel or animals or damage plants.

Biological Warfare (BW)—Voluntary use of living organisms or their toxic products with the
intent of killing or harming persons, useful animals or plants.
Biological Weapon (BW)—An item of material that projects, disperses, or disseminates a
biological agent including arthropod vectors.
CBRN—Operations that include chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear, either
individually or in combination. Collectively known as WMD, CBRN replaces ― “NBC” when
used in reference to operations or incidents limited to NBC-only issues. TIC/TIM and
HAZMAT are considered part of the ― “C” in ―”CBRN”.
CBRNE—Operations or incidents involving chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and
high-yield explosives, either individually or in combination. ― “CBRNE” is used anytime that
reference is not being made to WMD operations or incidents.
CBRNE Environment—Condition of warfare in which an adversary possesses or uses
chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or high-yield explosive weapons, by-products,
infrastructure, and associated delivery methods.
CBRNE Hazard—Those CBRNE elements that pose or could pose a hazard to individuals.
CBRNE hazards include those created from accidental realizes, TIM (especially air and water
poisons), biological pathogens, radioactive matter, and high-yield explosives. Also included are
any hazards resulting from the deliberate employment of WMD during military operations.
CBRNE High Threat Area (HTA)—Friendly forces in these areas are at high risk for attack
with CBRNE weapons by states and non-state actors, such as terrorists and criminals also known
as transnationals. Potential adversaries within the region either possess or are likely to possess a
substantial stockpile of CBRNE weapons and weapons systems and may have special operations
forces capable of conducting sustained attacks on airbases. Actual or potential transnational
threats exist during peacetime or wartime. Forces are within immediate strike range of adversary
theater missiles, and CBRNE strikes using these weapons are assumed to be likely to occur. Air
Force personnel and units in or deployed to these locations will be organized, trained, exercised,
and equipped to survive CBRNE attacks and conduct sustained combat operations in CBRNE
environments.
CBRNE Low Threat Area (LTA)—Friendly forces in these areas are at risk for attack with
CBRNE weapons by transnationals. Actual or potential transnational threats exist during
peacetime or wartime. Select personnel identified in IEMP 10-2 are organized, trained, and
equipped to continue critical missions and restore the primary mission. All other personnel in
these locations are trained to survive attacks.
CBRNE Medium Threat Area (MTA)—Friendly forces in these areas are at medium risk for
attack with CBRNE weapons by states and non-state actors, such as terrorists and criminals also
known as transnationals. Potential adversaries within the region either possess or are likely to
possess CBRNE weapons and weapons systems and may also have special operations forces
capable of conducting limited attacks on airbases. Actual or potential transnational threats exist
during peacetime or wartime. Forces may be within the extended range of adversary theater
missiles, but it is assessed that CBRNE strikes using these weapons are less likely to occur. Air
Force personnel and units in or deployed to these locations will be organized, trained, exercised,
and equipped to survive CBRNE attacks and to conduct limited combat operations in CBRNE
environments.

clouds. 2. (DOD only) Food or water made unfit for consumption by humans or animals
because of the presence of environmental chemicals, radioactive elements, bacteria, or
organisms, the by-product of the growth of bacteria or organisms, the decomposing material (to
include the food substance itself) or waste in the food or water.
Contamination Control Area—An area in which contaminated IPE is removed; people,
equipment, and supplies are decontaminated to allow processing between a toxic environment
and a toxic free area; the last area an individual can safely don IPE before moving into a
contaminated area.
Contamination Control Station—An area specifically designated for allowing ingress and
egress of personnel and equipment to or from the hazards area. The outer boundary of the CCS
is the CCL, and the inner boundary is the line segment labeled the hot line.
Contingency—An emergency involving military forces caused by natural disasters, terrorists,
subversives, or by required military operations. Due to the uncertainty of the situation,
contingencies require plans, rapid response and special procedures to ensure the safety and
readiness of personnel, installations, and equipment.
Contingency Operations Costs—These are the incremental costs that would not be incurred if
the contingency operation were not being carried out.
Continuity of Operations (COOP)—The degree or state of being continuous in the conduct of
functions, tasks, or duties necessary to accomplish a military action or mission in carrying out
the national military strategy. It includes the functions and duties of the commander as well as
the supporting functions and duties performed by the staff and others acting under the authority
and direction of the commander.
Control Zones—The areas at a HAZMAT incident that are designated based upon safety and the
degree of hazard.
Conventional Explosive Attack—Conventional explosives are compounds or mixtures (such as
ammonium nitrate, TNT, or plastic explosives) that create blast and cause fragmentation when
detonated. Military munitions and IEDs use conventional explosives. The vast majority of
attacks involving conventional explosives are simply conventional explosive attacks. ―High-
Yield “Explosive” (HYE), is a term used to further delineate conventional explosives and is
defined by DOD as: any conventional [explosive] weapon or device that is capable of a high
order of destruction or disruption and/or of being used in such a manner as to kill or injure large
numbers of people. (HYE is the E in CBRNE.). "Note that HYE is similar to the term
 132                                   AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014


―“WMD”– it refers to a weapon or device, and the method in which it is used so that it kills a
large number of people. The key for HYE is how the device is constructed and employed. For
purposes of planning protective measures, the CJCS (CJCSI 3435.01) further clarified HYE as a
device or incident involving: (1) the use of a conventional explosive weapon in conjunction with
a CBRN component or (2) the terrorist use of a conventional weapon or explosive device in such
a manner to inflict a large number of casualties. Examples include a vehicle-borne IED parked
adjacent to a hospital, or an explosive device placed strategically on an aircraft. The term
"explosive" or "conventional explosive" includes the term "HYE" unless specifically noted.
Conventional Weapon—A weapon that is not chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear.
Cordon—A physical barrier surrounding the incident scene where controls are established to
preclude unauthorized entry.

Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA)—Refers to DOD support, including Federal
military forces, DOD civilians and DOD contractor personnel, and DOD agencies and
components, for domestic emergencies and for designated law enforcement and other activities.
Deployment—1. In naval usage, the change from a cruising approach or contact disposition to a
disposition for battle. 2. The movement of forces within operational areas. 3. The positioning
of forces into a formation for battle. 4. The relocation of forces and material to desired
operational areas. Deployment encompasses all activities from origin or home station through
destination, specifically including intra-continental United States, inter-theater, and intra-theater
movement legs, staging, and holding areas.
Detection—In CBRNE environments, the act of locating CBRNE hazards by use of CBRNE
detectors or monitoring or survey teams.

earthquake, fire, flood, or other public disasters or equivalent emergencies that endanger life and
property or disrupt the usual process of government. The term domestic emergency includes any
or all of the emergency conditions defined below:
a. Civil defense emergency. A domestic emergency disaster situation resulting from devastation
created by an enemy attack and requiring emergency operations during and following that
attack. It may be proclaimed by appropriate authority in anticipation of an attack.
b. Civil disturbances. Riots, acts of violence, insurrections, unlawful obstructions or
assemblages, or other disorders prejudicial to public law and order. The term civil disturbance
includes all domestic conditions requiring or likely to require the use of Federal Armed Forces
pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 15 of Title 10, USC.
c. Major disaster. Any flood, fire, hurricane, tornado, earthquake, or other catastrophe which, in
the determination of the President, is or threatens to be of sufficient severity and magnitude to
warrant disaster assistance by the Federal Government under Public Law 606, 91st Congress (42
USC 58) to supplement the efforts and available resources of State and local governments in
alleviating the damage, hardship, or suffering caused thereby.
d. Natural disaster. All domestic emergencies except those created as a result of enemy attack

Emergency Decontamination—The physical process of immediately reducing contamination of
individuals in potentially life-threatening situations with or without the formal establishment of a
decontamination corridor. (NFPA 471) Note: The EPA does not require runoff control when a
process is used to save lives or reduce injury.
Emergency Operations Center (EOC)—For the purposes of AFIMS, the EOC is the C2
support elements that directs, monitors, and supports the installation’s actions before, during, and
after an incident. The EOC is activated and recalled as necessary by the Installation
Commander. The EOC updates the ICC with ongoing incident status and seeks support through
the ICC when on-scene requirements surpass the installation’s inherent capability and the
installation’s cumulative capabilities acquired through MAAs. EOCs may also support MCS and
joint information activities. According to the NRP, the EOC is defined as ―“The physical
location at which the coordination of information and resources to support attack response and
incident management activities normally takes place. An EOC may be a temporary facility or
may be located in a more central or permanently established facility, perhaps at a higher level of
organization within a jurisdiction. EOCs may be organized by major functional disciplines such
as fire, law enforcement, and medical services, by jurisdiction such as Federal, State, regional,
county, city, tribal, or by some combination there of”.
Emergency Operations Center (EOC)—For the purposes of AFIMS, the EOC is the C2
support elements that directs, monitors, and supports the installation’s actions before, during, and
after an incident. The EOC is activated and recalled as necessary by the Installation Commander.
The EOC updates the CAT with ongoing incident status and seeks support through the CAT
when on-scene requirements surpass the installation’s inherent capability and the installation’s
cumulative capabilities acquired through MAAs. EOCs may also support MCS and joint
information activities. According to the NRF, the EOC is defined as ―“The physical location at
which the coordination of information and resources to support attack response and incident
management activities normally takes place. An EOC may be a temporary facility or may be
located in a more central or permanently established facility, perhaps at a higher level of

organization within a jurisdiction. EOCs may be organized by major functional disciplines such
as fire, law enforcement, and medical services, by jurisdiction such as Federal, State, regional,
county, city, tribal, or by some combination thereof”.
Emergency Responders—The response elements of a DRF that deploy to the accident scene
after the First Responders to expand C2 and perform support functions. Emergency Responders
include follow-on elements such as firefighters, law enforcement personnel, security personnel,
and emergency medical technicians, as well as emergency management personnel, EOD
personnel, physicians, nurses, medical treatment providers at medical treatment facilities, public
health officers, bioenvironmental engineering personnel, and mortuary affairs personnel.
Emergency Responders also include specialized teams such as the EMST or SMT. Not all
Emergency Responders are First Responders, but all First Responders are Emergency
Responders. Emergency Responders are not assigned to additional duties that will conflict with
their emergency duties.
Emergency Support Function (ESF)—ESFs are groupings of capabilities into an
organizational structure that provides the support, resources, program implementation, and
services that are most likely to be needed during an incident. ESFs also serve as the primary
operational-level mechanism that provides support during an incident.
Evacuation—1. The process of moving any person who is wounded, injured, or ill to and/or
between medical treatment facilities. 2. The clearance of personnel, animals, or materiel from a
given locality. 3. The controlled process of collecting, classifying, and shipping unserviceable
or abandoned materiel, US or foreign, to appropriate reclamation, maintenance, technical
intelligence, or disposal facilities. 4. The ordered or authorized departure of noncombatants
from a specific area by Department of State, DOD, or appropriate military commander. This
refers to the movement from one area to another in the same or different countries. The
evacuation is caused by unusual or emergency circumstances and applies equally to command or
non-command sponsored family members.
Expeditionary Operation—An expeditionary operation is a military operation conducted by an
armed force to accomplish a specific objective in a foreign country. The missions of military
expeditions may vary widely. Examples of missions of military expeditions include providing
humanitarian assistance in times of disaster or disruption; establishing and keeping peace in a
foreign country; protecting US citizens or commerce abroad; retaliating for an act of aggression
by a foreign political group; and destroying an enemy government by defeating its armed forces
in combat.
Expeditionary Units—These designated units are formed to conduct a specific mission of
limited duration in support of a combatant commander requirement. Because a standing wing,
group, or squadron does not normally deploy intact, UTCs from multiple units are deployed to
create an expeditionary unit.
Explosive Ordnance—All munitions containing explosives, nuclear fission or fusion materials,
and biological and chemical agents. This includes bombs and warheads; guided and ballistic
missiles; artillery, mortar, rocket, and small arms ammunition; all mines, torpedoes and depth
charges; demolition charges; pyrotechnics; clusters and dispensers; cartridge and propellant
actuated devices; electro-explosive devices; clandestine and IEDs; and all similar or related items
or components explosive in nature.

First Receivers—Healthcare workers at a medical facility that may receive contaminated
victims for treatment.
First Responders—The DRF elements that deploys immediately to the disaster scene to provide
initial C2, to save lives, and to suppress and control hazards. Firefighters, law enforcement
security personnel, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) during Improvised Explosive Device
(IED) and nuclear accident response operations, and key medical personnel provide the initial,
immediate response to a CBRNE incident. All First Responders are Emergency Responders, but
not all Emergency Responders are First Responders. First Responders are not assigned as
augmentees or to additional duties that will conflict with their emergency duties.
Force Protection (FP)—Actions taken to prevent or mitigate hostile actions against Department
of Defense personnel (to include family members), resources, facilities, and critical information.
These actions conserve the force’s fighting potential so it can be applied at the decisive time and
place and incorporate the coordinated and synchronized offensive and defensive measures to
enable the effective employment of the joint force while degrading opportunities for the enemy.
Force protection does not include actions to defeat the enemy or protect against accidents,
weather, or disease. Also called FP. (JP 1-02) [An integrated application of offensive and
defensive actions that deter, detect, pre-empt, mitigate, or negate threats against or hazards to Air
Force air and space operations and assets, based on an acceptable level of risk.] (Definition in
brackets applies only to the Air Force and is offered for clarity.). See also AFI 10-245.
Functional Area Analysis (FAA)—The FAA identifies the operational tasks, conditions, and
standards needed to achieve military objectives. It uses the national strategies, the Family of
Joint Future Concepts, UCP-assigned missions, CONOPS, joint tasks, the capabilities list (e.g.,
Universal Joint Task List), the anticipated range of broad capabilities that an adversary might
employ and other sources as input. The FAA identifies the scenarios against which the
capabilities and attributes will be assessed. Scenario sources include, but are not limited to, the
Defense Planning Scenarios (DPS) published by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).
The FAA produces a prioritized list of capabilities and tasks across all functional areas necessary
to achieve the military objectives. The capabilities and their attributes should be traceable to the
Family of Joint Future Concepts and any other supporting information used to develop the
capabilities. These capabilities form the basis for integrated architectures and will be reviewed
in the follow-on functional needs analysis (FNA).
Functional Needs Analysis (FNA)—The FNA assesses the ability of the current and
programmed warfighting systems to deliver the capabilities the FAA identified under the full
range of operating conditions and to the designated measures of effectiveness. Using the
capabilities and tasks identified in the FAA as primary input, the FNA produces a list of
capability gaps that require solutions and indicates the time frame in which those solutions are
needed. It may also identify redundancies in capabilities that reflect inefficiencies. The FNA
will also provide the relative priority of the gaps identified. The FNA serves to further define
and refine the integrated architectures. The FNA must assess the entire range of doctrine,
 136                                   AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014


organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities and policy, as
an inherent part of defining capability needs.
Gross Decontamination—(Also known as Hasty or Expedient decontamination.) The start of
the decontamination process during which the amount of surface contaminants is significantly
reduced. Note: This process typically includes as a minimum completely flushing with water
and the removal of most or all of a person’s clothing while continuing to flush. When warranted,
decontamination soap or other products may be provided. The EPA does not require runoff
control when this decontamination process is used to save lives or reduce injury.
Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT)—Any material that is flammable, corrosive, an oxidizing
agent, explosive, toxic, poisonous, etiological, radioactive, nuclear, unduly magnetic, a chemical
agent, biological research material, compressed gases, or any other material that, because of its

order of destruction or disruption or of being used to kill or injure large numbers of people.
Homeland Defense—The protection of United States sovereignty, territory, domestic
population, and critical infrastructure against external threats and aggression or other threats as
directed by the President. The Department of Defense is responsible for homeland defense.
Homeland defense includes missions such as domestic air defense. The Department recognizes
that threats planned or inspired by ― “external” actors may materialize internally. The
reference to ― “external threats” does not limit where or how attacks could be planned and
executed. The Department is prepared to conduct homeland defense missions whenever the
President, exercising his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief, authorizes military
actions.
Homeland Security Presidential Directive—5 (HSPD-5)—A Presidential directive issued on
February 28, 2003 and intended to enhance the ability of the United States to manage domestic
incidents by establishing a single, comprehensive National Incident Management System
(NIMS).
Homeland Security—Homeland security, as defined in the National Strategy for Homeland
Security, is a concerted national effort to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States,
reduce America’s vulnerability to terrorism, and minimize the damage and recover from attacks
that do occur. The Department of Defense contributes to homeland security through its military
missions overseas, homeland defense, and support to civil authorities.
Host Nation (HN)—A nation that receives the forces or supplies of allied nations, coalition
partners, or NATO organizations to be located on, to operate in, or to transit through its territory.

AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014                                                     137


Incident Commander (IC)—The command function is directed by the IC, who is the person in
charge at the incident and who must be fully qualified to manage the response. Major
responsibilities for the IC include: performing command activities, such as establishing
command; protecting life and property; controlling personnel and equipment resources;
maintaining accountability for responder and public safety, as well as for task accomplishment;
and establishing and maintaining an effective liaison with outside agencies and organizations,
including the EOC when it is activated.
Incident Command System (ICS)—ICS is the model tool for command, control, and
coordination of a response and provides a means to coordinate the efforts of individual agencies
as they work toward the common goal of stabilizing the incident and protecting life, property,
and the environment. ICS uses principles that have been proven to improve efficiency and
effectiveness in a business setting and applies the principles to emergency response.
Incident—An occurrence or event, natural or human caused, that requires an emergency
response to protect life or property. Incidents can, for example, include major disasters,
emergencies, terrorist attacks, terrorist threats, wildland and urban fires, floods, HAZMAT spills,
nuclear accidents, aircraft accidents, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms, war-
related disasters, public health and medical emergencies, and other occurrences requiring an
emergency response.
Incidents of National Significance—An actual or potential high-impact event that requires a

Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC)—A committee established by the State
commission for each emergency planning district to plan and coordinate local emergency
response actions.
Lock down—An announced emergency protocol used as a security measure to confine and
restrict movement. Included are all military uniformed services, federal employees, contractor
personnel, dependents, or other people on an installation as a guest. Because of extenuating
circumstances, all personnel must remain confined inside the nearest vehicle, structure, or
building that provides a measure of protection. During lock-down, no person may enter or exit
another area until the "All Clear" is broadcast; unless a movement is required to escape from a
dangerous place or situation. Freedom to move within a vehicle, structure, or building providing
a measure of protection may be authorized regardless whether an "All Clear" has not been
sounded or not, but only when notification from wing leadership through the installation warning
and notification system is received that a specific location is not within the danger zone. Once
"All Clear" is announced, freedom to move around, exit, or enter is authorized. "All Clear" is
announced through the installation warning and notification system or through verbal
communication by wing leadership through Fire Emergency Services or Security Forces.
Low Threat Area (LTA)—See CBRNE Low Threat Area.
Major Accident—An accident involving DOD materiel or DOD activities that is serious enough
to warrant response by the installation DRF. It differs from the minor day-to-day emergencies

hurricane, tornado, storm, high water, wind-driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake,
volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, or drought) or, regardless of cause, any fire,
flood or explosion, in any part of the United States, which in the determination of the President
causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance under
this act to supplement the efforts and available resources of States, local governments, and
disaster relief organizations in alleviating the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering caused
thereby.
Mass Decontamination—(or, Mass Casualty Decontamination) The physical process of rapidly
reducing or removing contaminants from multiple persons (victims and responders) in
potentially life-threatening situations with or without the formal establishment of a
decontamination corridor. Note: The EPA does not require runoff control when this process is
used to save lives or reduce injury.

AFI10-2501_TINKERAFBSUP_I 20 FEBRUARY 2014                                                    139


Mission—Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP)—A flexible system of protection against
nuclear, biological, and chemical contamination. This posture requires personnel to wear only
that protective clothing and MOPP equipment appropriate to the threat level, work rate imposed
by the mission, temperature, and humidity.
Mitigation—Activities designed to reduce or eliminate risks to persons or property or to lessen
the actual or potential effects or consequences of an incident. Mitigation measures may be
implemented prior to, during, or after an incident. Mitigation measures are often developed IAW
lessons learned from prior incidents. Mitigation involves ongoing actions to reduce exposure to,
probability of, or potential loss from hazards. Measures may include zoning and building codes,
flood plain buyouts, and analysis of hazard-related data to determine where it is safe to build or
locate temporary facilities. Mitigation can include efforts to educate governments, businesses,
and the public on measures they can take to reduce loss and injury.
Monitoring—The process of sampling over time to identify changes in conditions.
Mutual Aid Agreement (MAA)—Written agreement between agencies, organizations, or
jurisdictions that they will assist one another on request by furnishing personnel, equipment, or
expertise in a specified manner. Reciprocal assistance by local government and an installation
for emergency services under a prearranged plan. Mutual aid is synonymous with ― “mutual
assistance”, ― “outside aid”, ― “memorandums of understanding”, ― “memorandums of
agreement”, ― “letters of agreement”, ― “cooperative assistant agreement”, ―
“intergovernmental compacts”, or other similar agreements, written or verbal, that constitute an
agreed reciprocal assistance plan for sharing emergency services. MAAs between entities are an
effective means to obtain resources and should be developed whenever possible. MAAs should
be in writing, be reviewed by legal counsel, and be signed by a responsible official.
Mutual Support—That support which units render each other against any enemy because of
their assigned tasks, their position relative to each other and to the enemy and their inherent
capabilities.
National Defense Area (NDA)—An area established on non-Federal lands located within the
United States, its possessions, or territories for the purpose of safeguarding classified defense
information or protecting DOD equipment or material. Establishment of an NDA temporarily
places such non-Federal lands under the effective control of the DOD and results only from an
emergency event. The senior DOD representative at the scene will define the boundary, mark it
with a physical barrier, and post warning signs. The landowner’s consent and cooperation will be
obtained whenever possible; however, military necessity will dictate the final decision regarding
location, shape, and size of the NDA.
National Disaster Medical System (NDMS)—The NDMS is an integrated Federal, State, local,
and private sector medical response system for medical support during wartime or major United
States domestic disasters. NDMS provides DOD with medical care resources from the civilian
sector to back up the Veterans Administration and DOD medical contingency arrangement.
National Emergency—A condition declared by the President or Congress by virtue of powers
previously vested in them that authorize certain emergency actions to be undertaken in the
national interest. Action to be taken may include partial, full, or total mobilization of national
resources.

Presumptive Identification—The tentative determination of a CBRNE material or pathogen’s
identity with sufficient specificity and confidence to make expedient, risk-based control
decisions until confirmatory identification can be completed.
Prevention—Actions to avoid an incident or to intervene to stop an incident from occurring.
Prevention involves actions to protect lives and property. It involves applying intelligence and
other information to a range of activities that may include such countermeasures as deterrence
operations; heightened inspections; improved surveillance and security operations; investigations
to determine the full nature and source of the threat; public health and agricultural surveillance
and testing processes; immunizations, isolation or quarantine; and, as appropriate, specific law

lessons learned; and develop initiatives to mitigate the effects of future incidents.
Regional Response Teams (RRT)—Regional counterparts to the National Response Team, the
RRTs comprise regional representatives of the Federal agencies on the NRT and representatives
of each State within the region. The RRTs serve as planning and preparedness bodies before a
response and provide coordination and advice to the Federal IC during response actions.
Response—Activities that address the short-term, direct effects of an incident. Response
includes immediate actions to save lives, protect property, and meet basic human needs.
Response also includes the execution of emergency operations plans and of incident mitigation
activities designed to limit the loss of life, personal injury, property damage, and other
unfavorable outcomes. As indicated by the situation, response activities include: applying
intelligence and other information to lessen the effects or consequences of an incident; increased

visiting military force deployed in the territory of a friendly state. Agreements delineating the
status of visiting military forces may be bilateral or multilateral. Provisions pertaining to the
status of visiting forces may be set forth in a separate agreement or they may form a part of a
more comprehensive agreement. These provisions describe how the authorities of a visiting
force may control members of that force and the amenability of the force or its members to the
local law or to the authority of local officials. To the extent that agreements delineate matters
affecting the relations between a military force and civilian authorities and population, they may
be considered as civil affairs agreements.

Vulnerability—a. The susceptibility of a nation or military force to any action by any means
through which its war potential or combat effectiveness may be reduced or its will to fight
diminished. b. The characteristics of a system that cause it to suffer a definite degradation
(incapability to perform the designated mission) as a result of having been subjected to a certain
level of effects in an unnatural (manmade) hostile environment. c. In information operations, a
weakness in information system security design, procedures, implementation, or internal controls
that could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to information systems.
Warm Zone—The area where personnel and equipment decontamination and hot zone support
take place. It includes control points for the access corridor and thus assists in reducing the
spread of contamination.
Water Vulnerability Assessment (WVA)—A method that provides a tool to understand the risk
of operations and pinpoint areas where security improvements might reduce risk. The
assessments focus on the effectiveness of existing countermeasures, mitigation, and recovery
capabilities.
Weather Warning—a short-range, installation-specific weather product/notice alerting
designated agencies to the imminent or actual occurrence of weather conditions of such intensity
as to pose a hazard to life or property for which the agency must take immediate protective
actions. Weather Warnings are issued for a USAF installation by a regionally responsible USAF
OWS or the installation USAF Weather Flight. The National Weather Service (NWS) issues
weather warnings for the surrounding civilian populace outside of the installation.
Weather Watch—a medium-range, installation-specific weather product that provides advanced
notice to designated installation agencies of potential for weather conditions of such intensity as
to pose a hazard to life or property. The weather watch can be thought of as a "heads up", at
which time agencies should begin to consider implementing required protective actions should a
subsequent weather warning be issued. Weather Watches are issued for a USAF installation by a
USAF OWS or the installation USAF Weather Flight. The National Weather Service (NWS)
issues weather watches for the surrounding civilian populace outside of the installation.
Weapon of Mass Destruction (WMD)—Weapons that are capable of a high order of
destruction or of being used in such a manner as to destroy large numbers of people. WMD can
be high explosives or nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological weapons, but exclude the
means of transporting or propelling the weapon where such means is a separable and divisible
part of the weapon.
WMD Civil Support Team (or National Guard Civil Support Team)—DOD has maintained
full-time Guard forces in Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams that are dedicated
to homeland security missions. These teams are comprised of 22 full-time personnel and are
maintained at the highest readiness levels and can respond rapidly to support civil authorities in
an event involving a weapon of mass destruction. Their role is to assist local officials in
determining the nature of the attack, provide medical and technical advice and help to identify
follow-on Federal and State assets that might be needed. Congress has authorized at least one
team for each State and territory. These teams are Federally funded and trained but perform their
mission under the command and control of the State governor.

A2.1. ESFs are groupings of capabilities that provide the support, resources, program
implementation, and services that are most likely to be needed during an emergency response.
ESFs serve as the primary operational-level mechanism that provides support during an incident.
These ESFs are modified from the NIMS/NRF construct to implement AFIMS. AFIMS specifies
that all phases of incident management will be the same regardless of the type of incident;
therefore, no unique wartime ESFs exist. See Table A2.1, Emergency Support Functions –
Offices of Collateral Responsibility (OCR).
A2.2. Each ESF has an OPR and one or more OCRs. The OPR for each ESF is identified on the
basis of authorities, resources, and capabilities. The OCRs provide additional capabilities within
each ESF. More detailed guidance, including the scope of each ESF is contained in AFMAN 10-
2502. Depending upon the scope and magnitude of the incident, the EOC Director activates the
appropriate ESFs to mobilize assets and deploy resources to support the incident. ESFs are
expected to support one another in carrying out their respective roles and responsibilities. OPRs
and OCRs should use the requirements of this AFI and the IEMP 10-2 to carry out their
responsibilities. OPRs are not functionally responsible for all specified ESF tasks, but will
coordinate the efforts of the OCRs in support of any given activity within the scope of that ESF.

      CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, NUCLEAR, AND HIGH-YIELD
       EXPLOSIVE (CBRNE) INCIDENT SITE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

This attachment provides specific functional responsibilities for an integrated CBRNE
Response Program. These roles and responsibilities apply to terrorist use of CBRNE, CBRNE
attack, peacetime incidents involving CBRN, and naturally occurring disease outbreaks.

Table A3.1. Assumptions
 1.     “CBRNE Incident” includes the full spectrum of hazards, from industrial accidents to terrorist
        and enemy combatant attacks. In the early stages of CBRN incidents, the type of
        incident--accident, terrorist attack, or enemy combatant attack--may be unknown.
 2.     Roles and responsibilities listed in this attachment apply to terrorist use of WMD, CBRNE attack,
        and peacetime incidents involving CBRNE.
 3.     Home station and expeditionary roles, responsibilities, and basic capabilities should be seamless
        whenever possible to maximize proficiency in the CBRN response mission.
 4.     First Responders and Emergency Responders need HAZMAT training and certification
        commensurate with their roles and responsibilities to comply with domestic requirements. These
        requirements are outlined in Chapter 6, Attachment 5 and Attachment 6.
 5.     Training and equipment gaps between current capabilities and capabilities outlined in this
        instruction will be identified to MAJCOMs for oversight and resolution.
 6.     The CE Environmental Officer is OPR for HAZMAT cleanup and site restoration operations in
        CBRN hazard environments. Incident site control will not be transferred to cleanup and
        restoration operations until adequate capability is in place for safe and healthy operations.
 7.     Roles and responsibilities outlined in the following tables represent tasks performed in support of
        the IC through any designated OPR agency.
 8.     All responders will be trained that a CBRN incident site may be a crime scene. Scene
        preservation, evidence handling, and chain of custody procedures will be included in training,
        evaluation, planning, response, and recovery.
 9.     There is no single OPR for monitoring operations.
