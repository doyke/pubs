    process procedures are detailed in (Attachment 5).
       2.6.1. Laser Hazard Evaluation. The BLSO or his/her designee (Bioenvironmental
       Engineering Flight Personnel or ULSO) performs hazard evaluations on all laser systems
       involving Class 3a lasers greater than 5 mW power, Class 3b lasers, and Class 4 lasers to
       determine the safe hazard distances associated with the laser and the required Optical
       Density (OD) for laser protective eyewear, skin protection, and engineering controls.
           2.6.1.1. The laser user must electronically forward the laser operating parameters
           using the Laser Specification Sheet (Attachment 6) to the BLSO, through the ULSO,
           so that a classification may be assigned, safe hazard distances calculated, auxiliary
           hazards considered, and laser eyewear/skin protection determined.
           2.6.1.2. A facility visit and review is performed by the BLSO to ensure the proposed
           laser systems will not present uncontrolled hazards to users and other personnel in the
           facility.
               2.6.1.2.1. For ANSI Class 3b and 4 lasers, the laser user must develop site
               specific written Safe Operating Procedures (SOP). A copy of the SOP must be
               provided to the BLSO prior to the BLSO’s facility review. SOPs are
               recommended for ANSI Class 3a greater than 5 mW.
               2.6.1.2.2. Warning signs and lights/beacons required to meet AFOSH Std 48-139
               must be affixed at all entry points to the laser area. The type of laser information
               required on the sign, such as its wavelength, pulse duration (if appropriate),
               maximum output, and the class of the laser or laser systems must be visible at
               door entryways.
       2.6.2. Each outdoor or range use of lasers must be reviewed and approved by the BLSO.

           2.6.2.1. Appropriate range signs, warning devices, written range protocols and
           controls must be used according to AFOSH 48-139, federal range standards
           referenced in AFOSH 48-139, and as determined by the BLSO.
3. Training of Personnel. Operator and awareness laser training shall be provided initially and
annually for the hazards associated with the specific type and class of laser being used, according
to AFOSH Std 48-139 and ANSI Z136.1. Training for DoD personnel may be provided by the
user’s organization, or the user’s organization may request the BLSO to provide training.
   3.1. Non-DoD personnel and/or their employers are responsible to ensure their compliance
   with initial and annual training requirements according to AFOSH Std 48-139 and the ANSI
   Z136.1. The Air Force is not responsible to provide this training.
   3.2. Laser pointer awareness training shall be accomplished for laser pointers that are Class
   3a greater than 5 mW.
4. Medical Examinations:
   4.1. All DoD personnel newly assigned to duties involving ANSI Class 3b and 4 lasers must
   have an initial laser eye examination before beginning these duties. The supervisor ensures
   each potentially exposed employee completes the eye exam. DoD employees receive the eye
   exam at the 88 MDG Optometry Clinic.
   4.2. Upon termination of laser duties (not limited to reassignment, work or a mission change,
   PCS/PCA, retirement, or separation) the supervisor ensures potentially exposed employees
   complete a termination eye examination. DoD employees receive the eye exam at the 88
   MDG Optometry Clinic.
   4.3. Non-DoD employees working in a laser environment needing an initial and termination
   eye exams will need to arrange for their exams from an outside provider.
   4.4. Occupational laser injuries, whether suspected or confirmed, should receive immediate
