   1.8.4. Key Career Position (KCP). The civilian workforce is comprised of centrally
   managed and non-centrally managed positions. Centrally managed positions consist of
   Career Positions and Key Career Positions (KCPs). Career positions are transitional for
   individuals with technical competency and management skills to move from functional
   expertise to corporate leadership. KCPs target competencies required at the Strategic
   leadership level.

       1.8.4.1. The objectives of civilian workforce development are to create a strategy to
       effectively develop leaders to meet mission requirements and the efficient use of financial
       resources. The workforce strategy is: 1) to identify capabilities and talent requirements,
       2) to develop management framework to meet force renewal, functional, and corporate
       requirements and 3) to ensure the framework is flexible enough across career fields to
       meet unique mission requirements. Efficient use of Air Force financial resources
       involves: 1) identifying the framework for executing financial resources/priorities, and 2)
       assessing an acceptable degree of risk and/or alternative funding.

       1.8.4.2. The KCPs provide the stepping stones for individuals to move from functional
       experts to corporate assets. They are frequently filled with high potential career-
       developed candidates that have demonstrated a sustained commitment to personal
       development and adaptability to change. KCP candidates have access to centrally-funded
       development opportunities to include training and tuition assistance.

       1.8.4.3. A Key Career Position is: Centrally Managed and in a major occupational series,
       requires a tour length of three to five years, provides critical experience in developing
       career field leadership, and must be vectored by the Career Field Development Team
       process.

       1.8.4.4. The Career Field Teams will further define criteria for their KCPs in their
       designated chapters in this AFMAN.

1.9. CAREER MOBILITY. Effective force development depends upon filling high-level
positions with highly qualified employees who have a variety of work experiences at various
locations throughout the Air Force. These varied experiences provide employees a range of
challenges and demands that may not be experienced in a single type of position or at only one
installation or organizational level. The career-minded employee should seek such work
experiences in more than one location or organization in a life-time career, but not more
frequently than every four years. This depth and breadth of experience may be the factor that
makes an employee the best qualified for referral. To attain appropriate depth and breadth of
experience in preparation for the next level of challenges, employees should remain assigned no
less than four years in CONUS centrally managed positions and no less than the prescribed
overseas tour in OCONUS centrally managed positions. See Figure 1.1. for a sample CONUS
Employment Agreement. AFMAN 36-204, Overseas Employment, provides samples of
OCONUS Employment Agreements. Employees seeking positions with increased
responsibilities are encouraged to make themselves available for reassignment to fulfill AF
mission needs. AFI 36-202, Civilian Mobility, provides additional guidance on mobility. Types
of mobility include: . .

1.17. METHODS OF FILLING POSITIONS.

   1.17.1. CFT Actions. Centrally managed positions are filled through both competitive
   and non-competitive methods. In most instances, the movement of a person into a
   centrally managed position is in the best interest of the Air Force. There may be some
   cases where a paid PCS would not be necessary to fill a centrally managed CFT position.

       1.17.1.1. The CPS can help identify which positions may be filled with local
       candidates based on local market conditions (i.e., existing pool of local
       employees, prevalence of retired military, unemployment in the area, etc). If local
       market conditions provide a sufficient pool of candidates, the gaining organization
       must clearly identify on the request for personnel action (RPA) that a paid PCS is
       not in the interest of the government. Examples include, but are not limited to:

               1.17.1.1.1. A civilian personnel office in the San Antonio area is filling a
               GS-0201-12, Human Resource Specialist (Civilian Personnel Section
               Chief) position. A government-funded PCS may not be in the best interest
               of the Air Force due to the overwhelming GS-0201-11/12 population in the
               local commuting area.

               1.17.1.1.2. A GS-2010-12 Logistician position at Hill AFB needs to be filled.
               A government-funded PCS may not be in the best interest of the Air Force
               due to the overwhelming GS-2010-11/12 population in the commuting area.

       1.17.1.2. There could be other compelling reasons that a PCS move is not in the
       interest of the government, but rather in the interest of the employee. In such cases,
       the Air Force must not fund the PCS. Examples of PCS moves not in the interest of
       the government may include, but are not limited to:

               1.17.1.2.1. Employee completes OCONUS service agreement, but for
               personal reasons remains at OCONUS location for more than six months
               without requesting/obtaining Commander’s approval to extend time limit for
               beginning return PCS travel.

               1.17.1.2.2. Employee has not completed all 48 months of AF CONUS Service
               Agreement (see Figure 1.1), and does not meet eligible waiver requirements
               for a second AF-funded move.

1.23. PCS RESTRICTION. The Joint Travel Regulations (JTR, Vol 2) restrict any employee
who is serving under a transportation agreement as a result of a Government-sponsored PCS
move from a second PCS move within a 12-month period. The basis of the restriction is the
prudence and cost associated with moving an employee twice within a 12-month period. The Air
Force requires a minimum 48-month tour length in CONUS CFT managed positions. Employees
must sign a completed CONUS Employment Agreement (see Figure 1.1) for each new CONUS
CFT managed position for which selected, to include OCONUS returnees exercising return
rights. For OCONUS CFT managed positions, the JTR identifies prescribed tour lengths.
AFMAN 36-204, Overseas Employment, provides samples of OCONUS Employment
Agreements. AFPC/DPI is the approval authority for a second PCS move when an employee has
not completed a full 48-month service period for all CFT managed positions except the Air
Reserve Technician Officer Career Management Program (ARTOCMP), which is managed by
AFRC/A1C; AFPC/DPIF manages the centralized PCS account funds. If a supervisor selects an
employee under such a restriction, the supervisor, not the employee, must provide sufficient
justification to support a request for waiver. The waiver request must be submitted to the
selectee’s owning CFT. Additionally, if the waiver request is for a second PCS move within a
12-month period, it must contain sufficient justification to establish that it meets the
requirements of the JTR Vol 2. All CONUS Employment Agreement waiver requests for those
who do not fulfill 48 months’ time on station must meet the following requirements:

   1.23.1. The proposed transfer is in the Government‘s interest;

   1.23.2. An equally qualified employee is not available within the commuting area of the
   activity concerned; and

   1.23.3. The losing activity agrees to the transfer. The CFT will review the request to
   ensure the information supports the requested waiver and will forward it to the Functional
   Manager (FM)/Development Team (DT) Chair or designee for concurrence/non-
   concurrence and signature. If the FM/DT or designee concurs, the concurrence will state
   specifically that:

       1.23.3.1. The waiver is in the best interests of the career field,

       1.23.3.2. The need to select the employee outweighs the additional cost of a second PCS
       in less than four years, and,

       1.23.3.3. Sufficient efforts were made to locate a candidate for the position who would
       not require a waiver.

   1.23.4. Automatic exceptions (no waiver required) to the 48-month rule are as follows:

       1.23.4.1. OCONUS returnees on tours of less than 48 months;

       1.23.4.2. Employees selected for promotion within 12-47 months of last PCS. (Note:
       Employees selected for promotion <12 months of last PCS require a waiver as outlined in
       paragraph 1.23).

       1.23.4.3. Employees selected for transfer to another DoD Component or non-DoD
       Agency within 12-47 months of last PCS. (JTR C5574-C).

       1.23.4.4. Employees separated as a result of reduction in force (RIF) or for the
       convenience of the Government.
   1.23.4.5. Employees called to active duty or enlistment in the Armed Forces.

   1.23.4.6. Employees participating in centrally funded civilian development education
   programs, where PCS is required as part of the program, are not subject to the 48 month
   time on station requirement.

   1.23.4.7. Employees who signed a 2 year CONUS Transportation agreement in FY13 are
   exempt from 48 month time on station requirement; they must comply with the two-year
   agreement signed in FY13. However, an employee with PCS orders showing an EOD on
   or after 1 Mar 2014 must sign a new AF CONUS Employment agreement to comply with
   the 48-month requirement.

1.23.5. If the FM/DT Chair or designee does not concur, the package will be returned to
the selecting official advising of the decision. When the FM/DT Chair or designee
concurs with the waiver, the package is forwarded to AFPC/DPIF through the
AFPC/FMAC Resources office for approval. The PCS waiver for an employee selected
for a position covered by the Air Reserve Technician Officer Career Management
Program (ARTOCMP) will be submitted through AFRC/A1C for decision.

1.23.6. Per JTR C5574 an employee serving under a service agreement for an AF CFT
managed position at any permanent duty station (PDS) may be released from the tour of duty
requirement specified in the agreement for reasons beyond the employee’s control that are
acceptable to the Air Force. The commanding officer or designee at the PDS is the authority
to determine whether the reason is acceptable. Examples of acceptable reasons include:

   1.23.6.1. Illness not induced by misconduct;

   1.23.6.2. Enlistment/call to active duty in the Armed Forces;

   1.23.6.3. Exercise of statutory re-employment rights within a time limitation that
   precludes completion of the tour of duty;

   1.23.6.4. Release for the Government’s convenience, such as separation because of
   physical/mental disqualification or lack of skill to perform duties of position for which
   recruited or any other position to which employee could be assigned;

   1.23.6.5. Separation as a result of reduction-in-force (RIF);

   1.23.6.6. When the employee’s services are not required for the entire length of the
   agreement tour of duty period;

   1.23.6.7. The employee’s immediate presence is required in the geographical locality of
   the home of record (actual residence) due to an unforeseen emergency;
   1.23.6.8. Completion of the agreed tour of duty would result in extreme personal hardship
   because of circumstances beyond the employee’s control, such as conditions seriously
   affecting the health, welfare, and safety of the employee, serious illness/death in the
   immediate family, or the imminent breakup of the family group.

1.23.7. An employee unable to complete the service agreement tour of duty requirements for
reasons unrelated to automatic waivers (see 1.23.4.) or selection for another Air Force
position (see 1.23) may submit a request for early release through the CPS for the
Commanding officer’s determination. The CPS will forward acceptable determinations to
the appropriate CFT, which will, in turn, submit to the FM/DT Chair and follow the steps in
1.26.5. The CPS will return unacceptable determinations to the employee.

1.23.8. Per JTR C5576 an employee with an unacceptable determination who fails to
complete the service agreement tour of duty is in violation of the agreement. An employee
who violates the service agreement is not eligible for travel and transportation allowances
and/or is indebted and must reimburse the Government the costs paid for
relocation expenses based on that service agreement. A service agreement violation
includes failure to:

   1.23.8.1. Meet/comply with the conditions specified in an agreement for reasons
   unacceptable to the Air Force;

   1.23.8.2. Report for duty;

   1.23.8.3. Return to the country/geographical locality in which the home of record (actual
   residence) is located in connection with a renewal agreement;

   1.23.8.4. Use travel and transportation allowances within a reasonable time after
   separation from an OCONUS location.

1.23.9. Per JTR 5584-B an Air Force approved service agreement time limit waiver based on
a Commander’s acceptable determination releases the employee from all financial liabilities
associated with failure to complete the service agreement tour of duty.

1.23.10. An employee who fails to complete the terms of the Transportation Agreement (DD
1617 or DD 1618) for reasons unacceptable to the Air Force must reimburse the Air Force
for the pro rata share of the PCS costs for the amount of unfinished time remaining and is
ineligible for Air Force funded PCS allowances (see JTR C5588 for computation examples).

1.23.11. An employee who completes the terms of the DD 1617 or DD 1618, but fails to
complete the second, third, or fourth year of the 48-month Employment Agreement for
reasons unacceptable to the Air Force, is ineligible for Air Force funded PCS allowances.

1.24.1. Each Career Field will have a pre-approved list of designated positions which includes
title, grade, and series of centrally managed and key career positions. The centrally-funded
PCS Account will fund a relocation to fill positions specifically identified by each Career Field
in advance of funds obligation. The Civilian PCS Account will centrally fund:
   1.24.1.1. The move of an Air Force employee selected for a CFT managed
   position, either from a referral certificate or through a management-initiated
   assignment, where approved in advance by the FM or designee.
   1.24.1.2. The move of an individual selected from a certificate if the person is a
   current Federal employee.
   1.24.1.3. The first-duty station move for an external reinstatement eligible applicant
   for a "hard-to-fill" position (upon CFT request).
   1.24.1.4. A return PCS when the Civilian PCS Account funded the move of an
   employee to an overseas location or U.S. territory, except where the employee is
   selected for a position offering reimbursement of authorized PCS expenses.
   1.24.1.5. The return move of an employee who retires overseas when the Civilian
   PCS Account funded the initial overseas move.
   1.24.1.6. Temporary quarters subsistence expense (TQSE) and miscellaneous
   expenses of an employee returning from another component in an overseas area or a
   U.S. territory to a stateside CFT managed position, including those affected by PPP.

1.24.2. Air Force organizations must provide funding to cover all PCS costs that result from
decisions to implement programmatic actions involving ramp-ups, stand-up of new
organizations, reorganizations, realignments, and military-to-civilian or contractor-to-civilian
conversions requiring a career field PCS action. Organizations are responsible for
programming the cost and providing funding to implement all policy, operational, training
and resource requirements relating to their force shaping actions. This guidance applies to
future programmatic actions approved in the Corporate Structure without PCS costs factored
into the original decision and to actions self-initiated by the organization or functional
leadership that impact the centrally managed Civilian PCS Account. Exceptions require
AF/A1 pre-approval.

1.24.3. Contracted relocation services are available to current eligible Federal
employees who are required to PCS and need assistance with selling their residence at the
old Permanent Duty Station (PDS) and/or finding a residence at the new PDS. Defense
Management Review Decision (DMRD) 974, dated 15 December 1992, consolidated all
Department of Defense (DoD) relocation services into the DoD National Relocation Program
(DNRP). DNRP operates in accordance with a contract with multiple relocation companies.
DNRP services currently available include Destination Services and the Guaranteed Home
Sale (GHS) service. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is the DoD Executive
Agent. The National Relocation Program Office (NRPO) located in the USACE Baltimore
District Real Estate Division administers the DNRP. The toll-free telephone number is 1-
800-344-2501. The DNRP handbook is available at
http://www.nab.usace.army.mil/BusinessWithUs/RealEstate/DNRP.aspx.

           1.24.3.2.1. GHS Eligibility. The program is available to current Federal
           employees selected for Air Force Senior Executive Service (SES) or CFT
centrally managed positions which are General Schedule grade level of 13 or
higher. The job announcement for GS-13 positions or higher may restrict GHS
eligibility to positions identified as "key career positions" (KCP). An employee
selected for a position in other appropriated fund pay banding systems is eligible
if the final base salary will be set equivalent to GS-13, step 1 or higher. The
move must be from one location to another in the United States, (including Alaska
and Hawaii), the Canal Zone area, or a U. S. territory or possession (such as
Guam). Additionally, an employee who returns from a completed tour of duty
from a foreign area to a non-foreign area different than the one from which
transferred may be eligible for the program per Joint Travel Regulations (JTR),
Volume 2, Chapter 5, Part P, Section 1, Paragraph C5750-D (employees who
traveled overseas on a first duty station move and employees who were hired
locally overseas are not eligible).

1.24.3.2.2. Application Procedures. An employee who meets the eligibility
requirements in paragraph 1.24.3.2.1 above must navigate to the DNRP web
address:
http://www.nab.usace.army.mil/BusinessWithUs/RealEstate/DNRP.aspx and
select the DNRP Online Relocation Services Request Form. All eligible
employees are required to complete the HR POC info on the DNRP Online
Relocation Services Request Form. Applicants funded by AFPC must cite the
POC name listed in block 28 Item G of the PCS order and include the email
address AFPCDPIEARESOURCESOFFICE@US.AF.MIL, while Air Reserve
Technician Officer Career Management Program applicants must cite the POC
name provided by AFRC/A1CS staff and include the email address
afrc.a1csa@us.af.mil. The DNRP Office will require applicants to submit a copy
of the Listing Agreement (if already available), an Addendum to Listing
Agreement from the DNRP website, and a copy of the PCS order authorizing
Relocation Services upon receiving employee’s application. AFPC/FMAC or
AFRC/A1CS will receive the auto-generated e-mail application for
review/approval and submit it to the DNRP office for further action with one of
the contractor companies. In turn, a DNRP services counselor will contact the
employee and explain the available services.

1.24.3.2.3. Additional Criteria. An employee's residence (former residence for
overseas returnees from a foreign area) must meet the requirements under the
JTR, Volume 2, Chapter 5, Part P, Paragraph C5750-B. According to DNRP
guidelines (DNRP Handbook, Sec. 7, Paragraph IID note), the residence must be
the employee's principal residence and cannot be a mobile home, houseboat,
or cooperative. The residence must be the place from which the employee
regularly (daily) commutes to and from work. The residence must be titled in
the name of the employee and/or one or more dependents. In situations
involving a divorce or separation, or title held with other than a dependent,
contact AFPC/FMAC (AFRC/A1CS for ART Officers) for further information
regarding limited pro rata reimbursement. The maximum home value for which
home sale services are payable is $750,000 per JTR Volume 2, Chapter 5, Part
Q1, Paragraph C5810-D. It is DoD policy that an employee is responsible for
any additional costs to the contractor relocation company if the home is sold
using GHS at a price exceeding $750,000, unless waived by the AF. An
employee requesting a waiver must submit the following information to the
orders approving official, either AFPC/FMAC or AFRC/A1CS: 1) Home
purchase documents showing purchase date and price; 2) Third party home value
estimate(s), such as Zillow.com or Realtor.com; 3) Comparable sales listing; and
4) Historical and projected market trends.

1.24.3.2.4. DNRP Enrollment Time Limit. An eligible employee must elect to
use GHS and complete the sale transaction prior to the one-year real estate time
limit IAW the DNRP Handbook, Section 3, Para III. Per JTR, Vol 2, Chapter
5, Part P, para. C5750-C3 the one-year time limit begins on the date the employee
physically reports for duty at the new PDS and ends on the one year anniversary
of the report-for-duty date. For example, the one year time limit for an employee,
who physically reports for duty on Wednesday, 6 Nov 13 is 6 Nov 14. Due to
GHS marketing requirements and administrative processing timelines, an eligible
employee should enroll NLT 120 days before the one-year expiration date to
allow time for AF-imposed 60-day home marketing plus the 60-day DNRP-
required home marketing plus completion of sale transaction. DNRP program
office will not consummate sale transaction beyond the one-year JTR limit for
sale transactions. It is employee's responsibility to seek a waiver to the one-year
time period for real estate transactions with evidence of extenuating
circumstances that the Air Force finds acceptable due to unavoidable
circumstances. See para. 1.24.7 for details regarding waiver requests.

1.24.3.2.5. DELETE

1.24.3.2.6. DNRP GHS-AF Pre-Enrollement 60-Day Listing of Property. AF
requires an eligible employee who elects to use GHS to market the home for sixty
(60) days (from the date of listing) prior to enrolling in DNRP GHS. Following
the AF imposed 60-day marketing period, and once the employee is enrolled in
the DNRP GHS, DNRP requires an eligible employee to market the home for an
additional sixty (60) days prior to accepting the GHS offer. The listing agreement
must include an exclusion clause to allow the employee to cancel the agreement
without incurring a broker’s commission should the employee elect to accept the
appraised value offer. The clause also permits the employee to assign an offer to
the contractor relocation company to relieve the employee of the responsibility of
closing the sale with the buyer. An employee who receives an acceptable offer
for the property based on appraised fair market values within the 60-day AF-
required pre-enrollment waiting period will not be enrolled in DNRP GHS and
will receive reimbursement using the JTR real estate authorization.

1.24.3.2.7. Home Marketing Incentive Payment (HMIP).

1.24.3.2.7.1. For employees with PCS orders that reflect an Entrance on Duty
(EOD) date on or after 1 Mar 14, AF does not authorize use of HMIP.
Alternatively, homeowners may use the DNRP GHS after marketing the residence
for 120 days (AF 60-day requirement before enrollment plus 60-day DNRP
 requirement once enrolled) or they may use the Real Estate entitlement
authorized in JTR, Vol 2, Chapter 5, for reimbursement of allowed closing costs
during a residence sale.
   1.24.3.3. Property Management Services. An employee transferring to a centrally
   managed position, who meets the DNRP GHS eligibility requirements in paragraph
   1.24.3.2.1, may select Property Management (PM) services in lieu of GHS. An
   employee may self-procure PM services through a rental agency and be reimbursed up
   to 10 percent of the monthly rent in accordance with the JTR, Volume 2, Chapter 5, Part
   Q1, Paragraph C5815-B2. The Air Force ordering-authorizing or authenticating
   official may approve PM services. An employee who elects to use PM services may
   later sell the residence within the applicable time limits in accordance with JTR
   Volume 2, Chapter 5, Part P, Paragraph C5750-C. However, an employee may not use
   GHS pursuant to the same PCS orders. The reimbursement amount an employee
   receives for the sale of a residence may not exceed the maximum amount allowed in
   Part P, Paragraph C5756-B1 less the amount paid for PM services. If the amount paid
   for PM services equals/exceeds the maximum amount allowed in Paragraph C5756-B1,
   then no reimbursement is allowed for the residence sale.

1.24.4. House Hunting Trip (HHT). When authorized an HHT per the eligibility requirements
found in JTR, Vol 2, Ch 5, Part M, Air Force employees and/or their spouse are authorized a
maximum of five (5) days, including travel days, to search for permanent housing at the
gaining Permanent Duty Station (PDS).

1.24.5. Temporary Quarters Subsistence Expense (TQSE). When authorized TQSE per the
eligibility requirements found in JTR, Vol 2, Ch 5, Part H, Air Force employees are
authorized the following:

   1.24.5.1. Within CONUS Moves. Authorized a maximum of 21 days TQSE-Actual
   Expense (AE) reimbursement method only.

   1.24.5.2. Overseas Returnees (Includes non-foreign overseas returnees). Authorized the
   option of 30 days TQSE-Lump Sum (LS) OR 60 days TQSE (AE) reimbursement
   methods.

   1.24.5.3. Extending TQSE (AE) Past the Initial Period. The criteria for extending TQSE
   (AE) beyond the initial period shall be uniformly applied. The authorizing/order-issuing
   official must determine there are compelling reasons to continue occupying temporary
   quarters. Extensions are not automatic and will only be granted on a case-by-case basis
   and in situations where there is a demonstrated need for additional time due to
   circumstances beyond the employee’s control and that is acceptable to the Air Force.
   Circumstances that exist at the time of transfer, such as high cost of housing, high interest
   rates, or a poor housing market may not in themselves be sufficient to warrant extending
   the TQSE (AE) period. The JTR, Chapter 5, Part H, C5364 lists examples of compelling
   reasons or circumstances which might be considered as beyond the employee’s control,
   although they are not inclusive. To clearly demonstrate the need for a TQSE extension
   the employee must submit the following information and documentation to the
   authorizing/order issuing official prior to the expiration of the initial TQSE period;
   AFPC/FMAC Resources Office (AFPCDPIEAResourcesOffice@us.af.mil) is the
   authorizing/order issuing official for all CFTs except the ARTOCMP, which is managed
   by AFRC/A1C.

           1.24.5.3.1. Date employee reported for duty at the new PDS.
           1.24.5.3.2. Date employee began TQSE.
           1.24.5.3.3. Date employee’s dependents began occupying temporary quarters and
           qualifying for TQSE.
           1.24.5.3.4. Number of TQSE days initially authorized.
           1.24.5.3.5. Number of days taken for HHT, if any.
           1.24.5.3.6. Anticipated date permanent quarters will be occupied.
           1.24.5.3.7. Number of day’s extension requested.
           1.24.5.3.8. Copy of contract to purchase or lease permanent quarters showing
           closing or occupancy date.
           1.24.5.3.9. If request is based on delay in HHG delivery, a statement from the
           Traffic Management Office (TMO) showing date of HHG pickup and anticipated
           date of delivery/receipt. If applicable, this should include a statement explaining
           the delay in delivering out of temporary storage.
           1.24.5.3.10. If request is based on delay in processing mortgage application, a
           statement from the mortgage company showing date employee applied for the
           mortgage, the normal processing time, and the reason for the delay. An extension
           request due to a closing date originally scheduled outside the initial TQSE period
           is not a valid request since the employee had an option to enter into a contract
           knowing the initial period of TQSE would expire prior to the final transaction.
           1.24.5.3.11. Other supporting documentation as deemed appropriate by the
           employee or agency.

1.24.6. Waiver Process for Real Estate Time Extensions Beyond One-Year Period (Two
Year Maximum). JTR C5750-C authorizes the Air Force to grant an extension if
extenuating circumstances prevented the sale/purchase transaction to be completed within
the one-year time period and those circumstances reasonably related to the PCS. Waiver
requests will be addressed case-by-case; the Air Force has broad discretion about whether to
approve a waiver. The waiver applicant should explain, in detail, why the extenuating
circumstances caused the delay, i.e., what made transaction completion unavoidable within
the one-year period. The employee must submit supporting documentation with the waiver
request to the authorizing/order issuing official prior to the expiration of the initial one-year
period. AFPC/FMAC Resources Office (AFPCDPIEAResourcesOffice@us.af.mil) is the
authorizing/order issuing official for all CFTs except the ARTOCMP, which is managed by
AFRC/A1C. Example: to support a waiver request based on a depressed housing market as
the "extenuating circumstance" the Air Force should consider, the applicant should address
these factors along with supporting documentation:

   1.24.6.1. Whether the decline in the housing market was as severe as the employee
   suggested;
   1.24.6.2. What efforts the employee made in selling the house during the initial one-year
   period;
   1.24.6.3. Whether the employee priced the house to sell given the selling or listing prices
   of comparable houses during the initial one-year period;
1.24.6.4. Whether the employee received any offers to purchase the residence during that
period; and
1.24.6.5. Whether the employee explicitly rejected or refused to consider such offers.
Figure 1.1.       CONUS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
         ASSIGNMENT TO A CAREER FIELD TEAM MANAGED POSITION

This agreement must be signed by an employee serving on a career or career-conditional
appointment selected for assignment to a Career Field Team (CFT) managed position in a
CONUS location

1. This document represents an agreement between the Air Force and the undersigned and
becomes effective upon my assignment to:

Position Title, Series and Grade or Pay Band __________________________________

Location: _______________________________________________________________

2. By accepting this assignment to a CFT managed position in a CONUS location, I understand
and agree to the following:

My minimum period of service is a 48-month tour of duty for the area to which assigned. Any
reduction to the minimum period of service is subject to management’s approval and my
concurrence (see AFMAN 36-606, para 1.23.6). Any prior DoD tour of duty already served in
the same local commuting area may be cumulative and may reduce the minimum period of
service, but not less than a total of four years of service.

3. I understand that I must satisfactorily complete the required period of service established for
the area to which I am assigned, unless a waiver is granted or I meet one of the conditions listed
below that do not require a waiver (see AFMAN 36-606, para 1.23.4). AFPC/DPI is the AF/A1-
delegated approval authority for any early release (i.e., waiver) from the period specified in this
agreement or from the transportation agreement; AFRC/A1C is the approval authority for early
release (i.e., waiver) for CFT covered Air Reserve Technician officer positions. If my
assignment is terminated earlier than the 48-month period for any of the following reasons, I do
not need a waiver and am released from all financial liabilities (see AFMAN 36-606, para
1.23.9):

a. Return from OCONUS short tours of less than 48 months.

b. Selection for promotion within 12-47 months of last PCS

c. Transfer to another DoD component position outside the Department of the Air Force

d. Transfer to any agency outside DoD

e. Separation due to Reduction in Force or for the convenience of the Government

f. Call to active duty or enlistment in the Armed Forces.
4. I understand and accept the conditions established in this agreement. I understand that failure
to complete the length of the assignment as I have agreed to do in paragraph 2 above may result
in my financial liability to repay the Air Force for the pro rata share (associated with the
unfinished time remaining) of the PCS costs already incurred and/or ineligibility for Air Force
funded PCS allowances to another Air Force position (see AFMAN 36-606, para 1.23.10 and
1.23.11, and JTR C5578 and C5588).

This Manual implements Air Force Policy Directive 36-6, Civilian Force Development, and
interfaces with Air Force Instruction 36-2640, Executing Total Force Development and outlines
procedures and criteria for civilian career field management and force development (FD). The
Air Force manages the careers of officer-equivalent civilians through a series of functionally-
oriented Career Field Management Programs (CFMPs); day-to-day operations of each program
are carried out by a corresponding series of Career Field Teams (CFTs). This Manual applies to
CFMPs, CFTs, supervisors, managers, and employees (including members of the Air Force
Reserve Officer Air Reserve Technician program); civilian personnel staffs; and civilian
employees at joint service organizations where Air Force is the executive agent and to other
Federal civilian employees and reinstatement eligibles. It does not apply to Air National Guard,
Title 32 Technicians.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision recognizes organizational, guidance and procedural changes and responsibilities
that have occurred within the Air Force during this period. This change eliminates Volume 1
from the title, and supersedes AFMAN 36-606, Volume 2, 1 December 1995, by incorporating
the elements of or identifying the location of the material previously contained in Volume 2, (in
almost all cases, that documentation is now posted in an electronic format accessible via the Air
Force Portal, the AFPC Civilian Career Field Management website, individual career field
communities of practice (CoP) websites or career field MyBiz pages).

                                          Chapter 1

             CAREER FIELD TEAMS - OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES

1.1. PROGRAM AUTHORITIES. The Air Force fulfills Civil Service Reform Act
requirements for executive management through a series of functionally-oriented career field
programs. Each career field program is administered by a Career Field Team (CFT) located
within the Directorate of Civilian Force Integration, Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC/DPI).
CFTs manage the careers of officer-equivalent civilians within their career field by developing
highly competent executives through a variety of training and developmental programs.
Additionally, the CFT provides for the systematic development of candidates for Senior
Executive Service/Defense Intelligence Senior Executive Service (SES/DISES) positions
through various force development initiatives to include participation in the Civilian Strategic
Leader Program (CSLP). Additional information about CFT objectives, structure, and
responsibilities is outlined in Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-2640, Executing Total Force
Development.
   1.1.1. Civilian Personnel Policy. The Directorate of Airman Development & Sustainment
   (AF/A1D) provides regulatory guidance and direction pertaining to Force Development and
   the operation of CFTs. The Directorate of Force Management Policy (AF/A1P) provides
   regulatory guidance and direction for the overall management of the civilian workforce
   within the AF.
   1.1.2. Functional Advisory Councils (FACs). Functional communities establish Advisory
   Councils chaired by the Functional Authority (FA) (or designee) to address unique functional
   needs. FAC Chairs may further designate individuals or groups to carry out certain
   authorities. If so designated, a record of written designations is maintained by the CFT.
   Groups (panels) may be established to manage such areas as promotion plans, referral issues,
   positions, training, leadership development, work force analysis and overall program
   effectiveness. Panels meet on a regular and recurring basis. Specific panels may be
   addressed in the individual CF chapters within this Manual.
   1.1.3. Development Teams (DTs). Senior members of the FAC form career field DTs.
   DTs provide mentoring and career advice to members of the career field through the
   vectoring process. DTs also rate and rank candidates for developmental opportunities such
   as Civilian Developmental Education (CDE). During this process, the DT evaluates the
   candidates‘ records to determine if they are ready for CDE. The DT also provides vectors
   identifying appropriate follow-on assignments for candidates selected to participate in CDE,
   Career Broadening, and CSLP.
Section A - Centrally Managed Positions
1.2. GENERAL. The Functional manager (FM) or designee shall establish criteria and provide
direction to CFTs for the coverage of positions centrally managed by the career field. Normally,
career field positions are either competitive or excepted service appropriated fund positions in
the General Schedule (GS) and their equivalents under other pay systems such as the Defense
Civilian Intelligence Personnel Management System (DCIPS), and demonstration projects
(AcqDemo, LabDemo).
 12                                                                AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011


1.3. CODING POSITIONS. The HAF Career Field Manager (CFM) designates centrally
managed positions within the career field unless delegated to the CFT. The installation‘s
servicing classification function and the CFTs at AFPC identify centrally managed career field
positions by coding and maintaining position data in the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System
(DCPDS). These data fields include the Career Field Identifier, Career Field Type, and Mobility
Reason. Civilian Personnel Sections (CPSs) and/or the servicing classification function must
verify career field coverage before filling vacancies. The CFT conducts periodic position
management reviews to identify and correct erroneous position coding.
1.4. POSITION CLASSIFICATION. Except as noted below, positions are classified by
offices maintaining classification authority for the installation or organization, to include,
servicing CPSs, the Air Force Manpower Agency (AFMA), Air Force Office of Special
Investigations (AFOSI), and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC)/A1C. When questions of
consistency or standardization in classification arise, AF/A1MR provides guidance and
assistance to AFMA, Major Commands (MAJCOMs), and comparable personnel activities and
CPSs.
   1.4.1. Career Broadening and Intern Positions: AFMA, in coordination with CFMs,
   classifies career broadening and intern (PALACE Acquire and COPPER CAP) positions
   funded through the Central Salary Account (CSA). Employees accepting a Career
   Broadening (CB) developmental assignment agree to pursue the objectives and activities
   specified in the developmental plan and core personnel document. Changes to the
   established core personnel document or current/history experience skill codes are not
   authorized for the duration of the CB assignment.
   1.4.2. CSLP Position Review. The Civilian Strategic Leader Program (CSLP) is an Air
   Force managed program which identifies and fills civilian command-equivalent positions.
   This program is managed by the AF/DPS CSLP office; manpower validation exercise and
   results are coordinated with MAJCOM A1s and the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC)
   Career Field Teams (CFT‘s). MAJCOM A1‘s and CFT‘s identify manning across
   Commands.
1.5. POSITION COVERAGE EXCLUSION. To request exclusion of a centrally managed
position from career field (CF) coverage, either permanently or on a one-time basis, the local
manager must provide a written request, with justification, through the servicing CPS and
owning MAJCOM to the appropriate CFT. The CFT will prepare a recommendation to the CFM
for adjudication.
1.6. RESTRUCTURING POSITIONS. Centrally managed positions are normally filled at the
full performance level unless a special need arises requiring filling the position below the target
grade. Arrangements to accommodate a special needs situation(s) must be made in advance, in
writing, with justification, and directed through the respective CFT to the FM or designee. The
FM may delegate the authority to approve restructuring a covered position to the respective CFT
Chief.
   1.6.1. Restructured positions are advertised DoD-wide unless specific arrangements have
   been addressed in the justification to limit the area of consideration and approved by the FM
   or designee. (See the appropriate career field chapter in this directive for career field-unique
   instructions).
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                        13


   1.6.2. The CPS and/or classification authority ensures any restructured position remains
   properly coded to reflect the full performance, or target, grade and retains the appropriate
   career field designations (career field ID, career field type, and mobility reason).
1.7. SKILLS CODING. Although skills coding will cease under USAStaffing, the codes
themselves will continue to reside in DCPDS for historical reference.
1.8. CAREER DEVELOPMENT ASSIGNMENTS. There are two primary types of
developmental assignments managed by CFTs: career broadening and career enhancing. Each
provides developmental work experiences intended to prepare employees for higher level
supervisory and managerial positions.
   1.8.1. Career Broadening (CB) Assignments. The CB Program is an integral part of the
   AF‘s leadership development framework depicted in the Civilian Development Continuum
   included at Attachment 4. It is designed to build occupational and institutional competencies
   while enhancing leadership perspective. The program is an integral part of structured
   development and is corporately managed. The primary focus of the program is current mid-
   level AF employees, typically GS-12 through GS-14 (and equivalents in other appropriated
   fund pay systems), however in certain instances assignments may be to positions at the GS-
   15 and equivalent level to meet specific career development requirements. Assignments may
   also be within Joint and Combatant Commands, where the AF is the executive agent, under
   appropriate training agreements and directives; for example, other Department of Defense
   (DoD) components and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD). Career broadening
   assignments, although of relatively short duration, are sufficiently complex and demanding to
   increase and broaden experience. Assignments may be between specialties or disciplines
   within a career field or across functional lines from one career field to another where skills
   pairing have been approved. (NOTE: Individual career field chapters in this directive may
   contain further details).
      1.8.1.1. CB Program Positions. CB assignments can be utilized to facilitate employees
      gaining experiences at the operational and strategic levels. Within the operational arena,
      assignments should focus on development within a functional community to gain breadth
      of experience (this could be accomplished across occupational lines within a single career
      field). At the strategic level, CB assignments should be considered to gain either
      MAJCOM or Joint experience. These positions, while placed at an organization for a
      career broadening assignment, are considered to be overhead positions (not part of the
      local Unit Manning Document (UMD) or critical for accomplishment of the mission). As
      such, CB authorizations generally are not to be used to establish new supervisory
      positions within an organization. DTs determine position location and work assignments
      to accomplish specific career development objectives; therefore, the location,
      occupational series, and grade/pay band level may change from one assignment to the
      next.
      1.8.1.2. Key Attributes of Career Broadening Program Positions.
          1.8.1.2.1. Centrally managed and funded by AFPC/DPI.
          1.8.1.2.2. Established against firm career broadening manpower authorizations that
          have been transferred into, and are funded by, the AF‘s CSA.
14                                                             AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011


        1.8.1.2.3. Centralized personnel servicing by AFPC/DPI and CPS at Randolph AFB
        TX.
        1.8.1.2.4. AF-wide mobility agreement required.
        1.8.1.2.5. Limited in duration, normally 30-36 months; an extension of up to an
        additional 12 months must be approved by the FM or designee and AFPC/DPIF.
        Because these positions are used for corporate development, assignment duration
        shall be limited to a maximum of 48 months.
        1.8.1.2.6. Filled by competitive reassignment, change to lower grade/pay band,
        temporary promotion, or DT vectoring with specific guidelines.
           1.8.1.2.6.1. Individuals identified for competitive temporary promotion to career
           broadening opportunities must meet applicable specialized experience and
           education requirements.
           1.8.1.2.6.2. On occasion, modifying experience requirements for career
           broadening reassignment/ change to lower grade/pay band placement actions may
           be utilized in accordance with OPM Qualifications Standards, Chapter II, Section
           B, Part E.8 (C). This provision does not authorize the career field to disregard
           minimum educational, licensure, or certification requirements in OPM standards.
     1.8.1.3. Using DT Vectors to Fill Career Broadening Positions.
        1.8.1.3.1. At the direction of their DT, career fields may require candidates to submit
        an Airman Development Plan (ADP) and/or resume as part of the career broadening
        selection process. DTs are comprised of senior leaders who are considered subject
        matter experts within their community and are convened annually or on an ad hoc
        basis.
        1.8.1.3.2. When this mechanism is used, career fields must publicize the fact that
        opportunities for these career broadening assignments will be limited to those who
        submit an ADP and who receive a vector from the DT. Additionally, if these career
        broadening opportunities are open to temporary promotion candidates, vacancy
        announcement(s) must be posted and the requirement for interested employees to
        submit an ADP and/or resume must be clearly stated in the body of the vacancy
        announcement.
        1.8.1.3.3. Career fields must ensure employees are made aware that the DT vector
        process will be utilized. At a minimum, career fields must accomplish notification
        using multiple communication methods such as: vacancy announcements, list
        servers, newsletters, bulletin boards, websites, and any other available means.
        1.8.1.3.4. The DT and/or CFT may request placement into a CB position via a
        management directed reassignment. In such cases, the Request for Personnel Action
        (RPA) must contain the following statement: ―This is a management directed
        reassignment approved by the (name of career field) DT Chair.‖
        1.8.1.3.5. Developmental objectives for individuals selected for career broadening
        assignment must be developed and periodic evaluations of progress to meet those
        objectives will be required by AFPC/DPI.
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                      15


        1.8.1.3.6. Resumes and/or ADPs may be required from applicants. (Refer to the
        appropriate career field chapter for detailed instructions.)
        1.8.1.3.7. A career field DT (or its designated selecting authority) may make
        selection for a career broadening position vacancy from a competitive certificate of
        promotion and/or reassignment eligibles. In these instances, the CB Program Office
        must first announce the career broadening position vacancy through the normal
        competitive process and issue a 90-day referral certificate of qualified candidates to
        the CFT. The CFT will then present the referral certificate to the DT or its designated
        selecting authority.
     1.8.1.4. DoD Priority Placement Program (PPP) Exemption. Selections made for
     assignment to the career broadening program are exempt from the PPP. The exemption
     permits placement onto a career broadening position by reassignment, change to a lower
     grade/pay band, or temporary promotion. Outplacements by reassignment or change-to-
     lower grade/pay band are also exempt from clearing PPP for those who have completed a
     centrally funded and managed career broadening assignment, to a follow-on position that
     has been pre-identified in the employee‘s formal developmental plan or memorandum of
     agreement. Follow-on assignment will be firmed up within the last six months of the
     career broadening assignment. This exemption does not apply to outplacement actions
     onto permanent positions through promotion; the DoD Automated Stopper and Referral
     System (ASARS) must be cleared for promotion actions. CB temporary promotion may
     lead to permanent promotion without further competition when PPP has been cleared
     before a follow-on assignment can be effected. This will apply only when full Air Force-
     wide competition was afforded during the career broadening selection process. In each
     instance the ASARS must be cleared prior to placement.
     1.8.1.5. Outplacement of Career Broadeners. Outplacement efforts begin one (1) year
     prior to completion of the career broadening program. Refer to chapter 3, paragraph
     3.5.9 of AFI 36-2640 Executing Total Force Development, for specific guidance.
     Outplacement efforts involve one or a combination of the activities listed below. The
     assignment of a career broadener is made in concert with the objectives of the career
     broadening program and in coordination with leadership officials to build functional and
     institutional competencies while enhancing leadership perspective. As such, DTs and
     CFTs have a responsibility to assess Air Force-wide goals, needs, and mission
     requirements within their communities, and take an active role in seeking out-placement
     assignments for graduating career broadeners.
        1.8.1.5.1. Referral and selection through the normal centrally-managed
        competitive process.
        1.8.1.5.2. Management-initiated Reassignment. The CFT will continually monitor
        existing/incoming career field fill requests for which the graduating career broadener
        is qualified and has indicated a preference, including those which match the
        occupational series and grade/bands identified in the career broadening Memorandum
        of Agreement (MOA). After identifying a match, the CFT will generate a career brief
        and provide it to the selecting official for consideration. This referral must be
        accompanied by an endorsement from the DT Chair/Co-Chair.

        1.8.1.5.3. Career field proactive efforts. Proactive efforts include, but are not
        limited to such activities as; 1) informing the community of upcoming graduating
        career broadeners; 2) issuing emails to functional leaders and actively marketing the
        types of series, grade/pay band levels, and skills of the career broadeners; 3) sending
        out information bulletins on list-servers about program objectives, priority placement
        flexibilities, and availability of career broadeners to fill projected and unanticipated
        vacancies; 4) involving mentors in the outplacement process; and/or 5) outplacement
        vectoring by the DT. These are just a few options; the intent is to be assertive in
        using all the resources available in placing our next generation of civilian leaders.
        1.8.1.5.4. Finalizing the Outplacement. A final placement must be firmed up and
        all necessary arrangements such as PCS orders, release date, new reporting date, etc.
        must be settled and agreed to by all parties concerned within six months but no later
        than 30 days from the end of the career broadener's assignment (Not To Exceed date).
     1.8.1.6. Payment of Career Broadeners:
        1.8.1.6.1. Salary: Salaries for career broadeners are funded from the AF‘s CSA.
        1.8.1.6.2. Annual Performance Awards: Annual performance awards are funded
        from the CSA with instructions and administration of the funds conducted by the CB
        Program Office, Resource Office, and the pay system‘s applicable reviewing
        authority.
           1.8.1.6.2.1. General Schedule Performance Awards. : erformance awards
           may take the form of time-off and/or monetary awards. Time-off awards may be
           approved by the supervisor for GS positions and so annotated as part of the
           appraisal package.
           1.8.1.6.2.2. General Schedule Quality Step Increases (QSIs): QSIs are not
           authorized in the career broadening program because it is a program to develop
           high potential employees. CB positions are designed to broaden the skills of
           high-potential AF employees for future leadership positions.                These
           developmental positions normally last between 30-36 months (with a maximum
           of 48 months) and are accompanied by formal developmental plans. It is
           expected that the individual will be learning and developing his/her skills during
           that period of time.
        1.8.1.6.3. GS Incentive Awards: Monetary incentive awards are processed and
        approved locally, and paid out of the local installation‘s funds. The organization
        granting an incentive award to a career broadener must contact the AFPC/DPI
        Resources section to complete the necessary transfer of funds to the CSA.
        1.8.1.6.4. Overtime: The central account will not pay overtime; this must be paid
        out of the local installation‘s funds. The organization granting overtime to a career
        broadener must contact AFPC/DPI Resources section to complete the necessary
        transfer of funds to the CSA.
        1.8.1.6.5. Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Costs: The central PCS account
        will fund PCS for employees moving into and out of career broadening positions. If
        the outplacement from the career broadening position is not to a career field centrally
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                       17


         managed position, PCS entitlements may be limited. See section 1.24 for additional
         information.
     1.8.1.7. Career Broadening Assignments Overseas. Employees accepting a CB
     assignment at an overseas location must sign an Overseas Return Agreement in
     accordance with AFMAN 36-204, Overseas Employment, Chapters 3 and 7.
  1.8.2. Career Enhancing Positions. Career Enhancing positions are a permanent part of an
  organization‘s infrastructure and are centrally managed separately by each CF. These are
  time-limited with continuing work assignments, and they normally involve work that is Air
  Force-wide in scope, responsibility, and complexity. Key attributes of career enhancing
  positions include:
     1.8.2.1. Centrally or locally managed.
     1.8.2.2. Established against positions on the local UMD (locally owned and funded).
     1.8.2.3. Personnel servicing provided locally (same as other local positions).
     1.8.2.4. Require an AF-wide mobility agreement as determined by each career field.
     1.8.2.5. Limited in duration, as determined by the career field, normally 2-3 years.
     1.8.2.6. May be filled through any appropriate, competitive staffing procedure.
  1.8.3. Air Force Civilian Strategic Leader Program (CSLP). CSLP is a component of the
  talent management strategy for strategic level civilians. Talent Management is a collection
  of processes with the intent of preparing Air Force civilians for challenging and critical
  leadership positions, determining who is most qualified and ready for those positions, and
  filling those leadership positions most advantageously for the Air Force. This program is
  open to all GS-14/15s or equivalents meeting specific eligibility requirements. CSLP
  initially contains four interrelated, but separate processes/programs that are synchronized to
  enhance the overall development and management of a segment of the civilian strategic
  workforce.
     1.8.3.1. The processes/programs include:
         1.8.3.1.1. Director Screening and Assignment: designed to fill command-equivalent
         positions (Wing and Group Director and Deputy Directors).
         1.8.3.1.2. Senior Leader Education: assists in establishing criteria, develops the
         portfolio of opportunities, facilitates the process of identifying candidate
         requirements, and assists in placing candidates into executive education programs.
         1.8.3.1.3. Senior Leader Experiential Management: identifies and maintains portfolio
         of experiential opportunities, identifies and maintains a list of GS-14/15 or
         equivalents, and creates and executes individualized development plans for high
         potential civilian employees.
         1.8.3.1.4. Senior Leader Execution and Program Support: lead for all development
         programs for GS-14/15 or equivalent personnel to include the National Security
         Professional Program, Individual Development Plans, Joint Leader Strategic
         Competency Model, and Career Broadening and Defense Senior Leader Development
         Program.
18                                                              AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011


     1.8.3.2. Objectives:
        1.8.3.2.1. Develop systematic, open processes to compete and fill Air Force
        command-equivalent positions at the GS-14/15 grade levels.
        1.8.3.2.2. Create programmed movement through Air Force civilian command-
        equivalent positions in order to best meet mission requirements, provide fresh
        leadership perspectives to the organizations, and increase the number of civilian
        leaders who have been developed through this type of experience.
        1.8.3.2.3. Institutionalize the requirements for filling command-equivalent positions
        by providing clear, merit-based, corporate processes.
        1.8.3.2.4. Assess senior development opportunities based on development needs.
        Enhance succession planning within the Air Force civilian workforce by building a
        qualified and developed cadre.
     1.8.3.3. Director Screening and Assignment Overview. Director Screening and
     Assignment includes a board process for identifying and filling Air Force command-
     equivalent positions at the GS-14/15 grade levels. The Air Force Senior Executive
     Management Division (AF/DPS) identifies command-equivalent positions, coordinates
     the board and bidding and matching processes to fill the positions for a three year
     assignment with a one year management option to extend.
     1.8.3.4. Overview of Annual Process. There are four major components to the annual
     calendar year (CY) process:
        1.8.3.4.1. Position Identification. Command-equivalent positions will be identified
        by AF/DPS using both manpower data and coordination with the MAJCOMs. All
        civilian Wing Director, Vice Wing Director, Group Director and Group Deputy
        Director positions will be filled using this program. Each year, AF/DPS will validate
        the list of upcoming vacancies based on previous assignment of a Director
        Assignment participant to the position. All positions identified as open for fill in the
        CY will be added to a list for advertisement as available for the next year‘s program.
        The Civilian Force Development Panel (CFDP) will validate the position list each
        year.
        1.8.3.4.2. Member Identification, Screening, and Application. AF/DPS will
        annually task the Development Teams (DT) to identify potential GS-14/15 candidates
        based on the list of projected vacancies and designated criteria. The list of projected
        vacancies will be available to the DTs for review. Within the AF‘s succession
        planning criteria, the DTs will invite potential candidates to submit applications for
        the Director Screening Board (DSB). Individuals who are invited may opt out of
        consideration with no penalty; however, a survey will be provided to obtain feedback
        on why they chose not to compete.
        1.8.3.4.3. Member Boarding. All members who accept the DT invitation will meet
        the DSB and be evaluated on their readiness, based on their performance and other
        designated criteria as outlined by the Board, to serve in one of the command-
        equivalent positions. Final board results will be approved by the CSAF.
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                        19


        1.8.3.4.4. Candidate Bidding and Matching. After the Board results are approved,
        AF/DPS will coordinate with MAJCOMs to complete the bidding and matching
        process.
     1.8.3.5. Position Identification (Initially and Annually)
        1.8.3.5.1. Positions are managed through the Director Screening and Assignment
        process if they are:
            1.8.3.5.1.1. An Air Force position at the GS-14/15 level, AND
            1.8.3.5.1.2. Command-equivalent responsibilities at the civilian Wing Director,
            Deputy Wing Director, Group Director, and Group Deputy Director positions
        1.8.3.5.2. These command-equivalent positions will be filled from a central list.
        Therefore, selecting officials, functional managers, and MAJCOM A1 and functional
        staff must sign a memorandum of agreement (MOA) upon designation of the position
        as command-equivalent that outlines the administrative procedures for filling a
        Director Screening and Assignment process designated position.
        1.8.3.5.3. To ensure the integrity of the position identification process, all positions
        identified for the Director Assignment initiative will be reviewed by the CFDP.
        1.8.3.5.4. In general, positions for Director Assignment position are:
            1.8.3.5.4.1. Wing Director/Deputy Director equivalent positions: in charge of at
            least 1000 people; mission-focused.
            1.8.3.5.4.2. Group Director/Deputy Director equivalent positions: in charge of at
            least 400 people; mission-focused.
     1.8.3.6. Member Identification, Screening, and Application Process
        1.8.3.6.1. Eligibility. Employees must meet the following criteria to be eligible for
        Director Assignment:
            1.8.3.6.1.1. Held a GS-14/15 position for at least 12 months (this is not a

            1.8.3.6.1.6. Not previously held command-equivalent leadership position of the
            same type at the GS-14/15 grade levels (e.g., previous group directors or
            equivalent may not be eligible for second group director).
            1.8.3.6.1.7. Technical qualifications necessary to fulfill position (as applicable to
            current position list).
        1.8.3.6.2. DT Involvement in the Process. DTs are charged with:

 20                                                               AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011


              1.8.3.6.2.2. Screening members for suitability.
              1.8.3.6.2.3. Inviting identified members to meet the DSB.
              1.8.3.6.2.4. Ensuring the appropriate grade level of DT members when
              conducting Director screening.
       1.8.3.7. Outplacement – Completion          of   Director/Deputy    assignment. AF/DPS
       facilitates the member‘s outplacement:
           1.8.3.7.1. Nine months from assignment completion date, the FA/FM community are
           notified of the need to outplace the member; future process may include a corporate
           outplacement board.
           1.8.3.7.2. Six months from assignment completion date, if no outplacement is
           identified, the CFDP reviews to identify outplacement opportunities.
           1.8.3.7.3. Three months from assignment completion date, if no outplacement is
           identified, FAs will work with AF/DPS and the MAJCOM to place the member in an
           overhire billet and continue to work outplacement. Additionally, status of candidates,
           to include pending rotation dates, will be reviewed at each CFDP off-site.
Section B - Participation
1.9. CAREER MOBILITY. Effective force development depends upon filling high-level
positions with highly qualified employees who have a variety of work experiences at various
locations throughout the Air Force. These varied experiences provide employees a range of
challenges and demands that may not be experienced in a single type of position or at only one
installation or organizational level. The career-minded employee should seek such work
experiences in more than one location or organization in a life-time career. This depth and
breadth of experience may be the factor that makes an employee the best qualified for referral.
Employees seeking responsible positions are encouraged to make themselves available for
reassignment to fulfill AF mission needs. AFI 36-202, Civilian Mobility, provides additional
guidance on mobility. Types of mobility include:
   1.9.1. Organizational Mobility.      Organizational mobility is movement between
   organization levels (e.g., base to MAJCOM); between major subdivisions within an
   organizational level; between MAJCOMs and comparable organizations or other major
   subdivisions within the AF; and between the AF and other Components/Agencies with the
   DoD.
   1.9.2. Functional Mobility. Functional mobility is movement between specialties or
   disciplines within a career field or movement across career fields.
   1.9.3. Geographic Mobility. Each of the above types of developmental mobility may or
   may not involve geographic mobility, since a variety of assignments are possible within the
   same geographic area without changing a place of residence. Geographic mobility is a
   change in permanent duty assignment from one location to another that requires the
   employee to undergo a PCS.
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                      21


   1.9.4. Mobility Requirements. When a mobility agreement is required, the employee,
   AFPC/DPI and/or the servicing CPS representative sign a written statement of conditions
   (see sample mobility agreement at Attachment 3). The mobility agreement is a condition of
   employment and must be signed by the employee prior to the assignment or prior to making a
   final commitment.
       1.9.4.1. The following AF positions require mobility as a condition of employment or
       assignment:
          1.9.4.1.1. Reference AFI 36-602, Civilian Intern Programs, for details on Intern
          mobility.
          1.9.4.1.2. Career Broadening and Career Enhancing. These positions require a
          mobility agreement as a condition of assignment to ensure the positions are vacated
          after a specified period and to ensure continuous development of employees.
          1.9.4.1.3. Long-Term Training (LTT). As part of the application package for an
          LTT developmental opportunity, an employee may be required to sign an AF wide
          mobility agreement.
          1.9.4.1.4. Civilian Strategic Leadership Program (CSLP). As a key leadership
          development experiential program, CSLP positions are few in number and require
          movement of the employee upon completion of their tenure in the position to ensure
          continued flow of employees.
       1.9.4.2. Specific Career Field Positions. Individual career field chapters may contain
       further details for their centrally managed positions.
1.10. AIRMAN DEVELOPMENT PLAN (ADP) COMPLETION. Completion of an ADP is
essential for career minded employees who aspire to higher responsibilities. Career fields may
use ADPs for training nominations and selections, management and leadership development, i.e.,
career broadening and CDE, assessments, interviews, career counseling, and workforce analysis.
Employees complete ADPs through the online ADP tool.
   1.10.1. Applicability.
       1.10.1.1. Training & Development. Supervisors identify employees for training and
       development opportunities, such as tuition assistance, short courses, and management
       development courses, and assignments.
       1.10.1.2. Management and Leadership Development. Management and leadership
       development of the civilian work force is an essential component of long-term mission
       readiness. The AF Civilian Development Continuum (Attachment 5) is the corporate
       prototype to sustain senior level civilian development and prepare high-potential
       employees for leadership opportunities. These programs prepare the civilian work force
       to compete for shared leadership positions and provide executive credentialing for high-
       potential managers. AF-wide nomination and selection criteria are used for AF-wide
       competitive development programs, as well as civilian developmental education (CDE).
 22                                                               AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011


       1.10.1.3. Work Force Analysis & Management Advisory Service. Career fields
       utilize ADP data for a variety of work force analysis and reports to senior leadership.
       1.10.1.4. Assessments and Interviews. Some career fields require ADPs for eligibility
       for managerial assessments or interviews. These are used as merit criteria and will
       enhance competitiveness in the rating and ranking process for career field positions.
   1.10.2. Eligible Categories. The following categories of employees are eligible to complete
   an ADP:
       1.10.2.1. Permanent Air Force full-time, part-time, and intermittent employees serving
       on a competitive appointment.
       1.10.2.2. Permanent Air Force full-time, part-time, and intermittent employees in the
       excepted service, provided they are eligible for non-competitive conversion to a
       competitive service appointment.
       1.10.2.3. Permanent Air Force full-time, part-time, and intermittent employees in the
       excepted service who have not held a competitive appointment are eligible to register and
       are eligible for career field excepted service positions only.
       1.10.2.4. Each career field establishes participation eligibility for its centrally managed
       positions. Employees are eligible to complete an ADP if they meet the prerequisites
       identified for a particular career field.
1.11. CURRENCY & ACCURACY OF EMPLOYEE DATA. Employees are ultimately
responsible for ensuring the accuracy of their data in DCPDS and have a continuing requirement
to review their records periodically to make certain their experience, education, awards, etc. are
properly documented. Employees are able to use the My Biz Self-Service module to update
certain information in their personnel record, to include: licenses, occupational certifications,
education, training, work information (phone number, email address, physical work address),
home phone number, handicap code, ethnicity and race category, language, and emergency
contact information. APDP certifications entered in MyBiz by employees do not update the
DCPDS acquisition certification data fields. Employees must complete the following processes
for updating acquisition data fields. Updates/changes to an employee‘s education by the
employee will be listed as ―Self Certified.‖ For positions which require positive education (a
specific degree or 24 hours of related course work), employees are responsible for ensuring their
transcripts are on file for review to ensure qualifications are met. Employees can submit
education, license, language, occupational certification and experience update requests using
Optional Form (OF) 612, Optional Application for Federal Employment, via fax to AFMA/MAH
at DSN 665-2937/Commercial 210-565-2937. To facilitate the electronic process, AFMA/MAH
requests employees fax them all update requests. This fax cover sheet should be used when
submitting update requests. AFMC/AFDW employees can submit these documents through the
AFPC/OL who services them. Employees must also complete the following information from
Section A on the OF 612 for all update requests: last, first and middle name, social security
number, phone numbers, mailing address, phone numbers, and e-mail address, if available. To
clarify this is an update request, simply indicate ―Record Update‖ in Job Title in Announcement.
In Section I, employees must sign and date the applicant certification. Employees may obtain an
OF 612 from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) website.
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                          23


   1.11.1. Employee Career Brief. A career brief is a computer-generated summary of an
   employee's present and past work experience, education, awards, etc. Career briefs are used
   for a variety of career field decisions, including selection for positions. Employees should
   work with the servicing CPS to update and/or correct erroneous data.
   1.11.2. Employee Resume. Employees may be asked to submit resumes in support of
   career field and force development processes, such as nominations for training and
   development, selection/assessment boards, competency assessments, or upon request by
   selecting officials for competitive referrals.
Section C - Work Force Development
1.12. STRATEGIC PLANNING. CFTs provide assistance and information to the CFM, FM,
and FA on the management of the total civilian workforce, including college recruitment,
employee development trends, hiring/promotion demographics and career progression. They also
oversee the data management of the civilian career fields; develop and conduct studies of internal
and external civilian career field trends; perform civilian career field research, analyses, and
surveys; and manage the development of civilian strategic and business plans.
1.13. WORK FORCE ANALYSIS. Each FAC defines the criteria and identifies positions to
be covered by their respective career field. Career fields determine long-term personnel
requirements by identifying the number of AF employees eligible to compete for covered
positions and projecting vacancy rates using such data as projected retirement, historical turnover
rate, mission changes, or anticipated workload increases. Further analysis of work force
composition, as it pertains to specific skill requirements and affirmative employment objectives,
assists in determining specific areas for marketing emphasis, targeted recruitment, or training
needs.
1.14. LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT
   1.14.1. Identification of Exceptional or High Potential Performers. Centrally-managed
   career field positions are considered the primary ―feeder‖ positions to CSLP and SES/DISES
   positions. Career fields may develop procedures to identify exceptional or high potential
   performers, to include: guiding and monitoring employee training consistent with
   developmental templates or their career path; assuring employees have gained the training,
   development, and career growth experiences needed for further advancement; and, arranging
   career enhancing job rotations, details, and special project assignments. At a minimum, and
   through the operation of their respective DTs, each career field team will nominate high-
   potential candidates from within the career field for inclusion in CSLP.
   1.14.2. Developmental Templates. The AF Civilian Force Development Career Planning
   Diagram at Attachment 4 and the developmental templates depicted in the individual career
   field chapters reflect the competencies valued by the Air Force and provide a clear
   progression model from entry to senior leader levels. While no individual will likely do
   everything described, these guides are intended as a clearly defined framework within which
   employees should plan their careers. Supervisors and managers are encouraged to use these
   tools as well when engaged in mentoring activities or discussing career opportunities with
   their subordinates.
 24                                                                 AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011



1.15. AFFIRMATIVE EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM (AEP) PLANNING.
   1.15.1. Responsibilities. Each career field should have an AEP plan covering all facets of
   selection, training, promotion and development opportunities in the career field which it
   oversees. The AEP plan is a legally mandated continuing affirmative program to promote
   equal opportunity and to identify and eliminate discriminatory practices and policies. The
   AEP plan should include analysis, over time, of the centrally-managed positions within the
   career field to identify and eliminate barriers that hamper the advancement of any individual
   on the basis of race, national origin, sex or disability. CFTs assist FACs in developing AEP
   plans and preparing annual progress reports for FAC Chair signature, together with other
   metrics developed to measure the health of the program. A functional member within each
   career field team is tasked to regularly brief their DT on progress toward barrier
   identification and removal. Annual reports should reflect accomplishment in eliminating
   barriers and ensuring equal employment opportunity. Copies of these reports should be
   submitted to AF/A1Q, for use in their submission of the required annual MD-715 report on
   behalf of the Air Force.
Section D - Filling Positions
1.16. GENERAL. The Central Referral Process (CRP) is the primary method used to provide
competitive referral certificates used in filling centrally managed positions. If the CPS identifies
a need to employ a recruitment method other than through the career field, prior approval by the
appropriate career field must be granted. The CPS must use the Career Field-developed
Promotion Plans or assessments when filling centrally managed positions. Career fields fill
centrally-managed positions using the guidance in AFMAN 36-203, Staffing Civilian Positions.
Procedures specific to career field operations are outlined below.
   1.16.1. Developing and Validating Merit Promotion Criteria. Each CFT applies merit
   promotion criteria to develop promotion plans and assessments used to produce competitive
   referral certificates. The criteria are developed through the Air Force method of job analysis
   and become part of each promotion plan. The combined process assures criteria are valid and
   that the best qualified candidates are referred for consideration and selection.
   1.16.2. Job Analysis. A job analysis consists of an analysis of a position (or series of like
   positions) to identify the component Major Job Requirements (MJRs) and the specific job-
   related criteria needed to perform the MJRs. The specific job-related criteria take the form of
   Knowledge, Skills and Abilities (KSAs), and may be represented by various competencies
   and their definitions. Once the skills are identified, they are incorporated into the promotion
   plan or assessment for the position and arrayed in a fashion that permits the records of all
   competing candidates to be compared to a series of progressively more demanding criteria.
   Candidates who most nearly meet these objective criteria will be referred for selection
   consideration. The official position description, in the form of a core personnel document
   (COREDOC) or Standard Core Position Description (SCPD), is used as the basis for the job
   analysis.
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                        25


  1.16.3. Promotion Plan. The promotion plan is the objective statement of position
  requirements against which candidate experience records are evaluated. It results from job
  analysis. At a minimum, it must show the position(s) covered, documentation of the
  minimum qualification standards, selective placement factors (if used), and applicable quality
  ranking factors (if used). Candidates are rated and ranked utilizing the promotion plan
  criteria.
  1.16.4. Promotion Plan Approval. Each respective career field promotion panel (or
  equivalent group) is composed of functional representatives with experience in the
  occupation(s) covered by the career field. In their role as subject matter experts (SMEs) for
  the career field, they typically design and develop standard AF-wide promotion plans for use
  in providing competitive referral certificates for centrally managed positions. The Promotion
  Panel Chair (or DT Chair), together with the appropriate CFT, will validate and approve
  promotion plans according to OPM requirements and AF guidelines.
     1.16.4.1. Promotion Panel Responsibilities. Functional promotion panels or workgroups
     are responsible for developing Air Force wide merit promotion criteria and plans for
     centrally managed positions in their career field. They annually review the results of the
     application of the plans and make adjustments to them to ensure their currency. Over
     time, they ensure that promotion plans reinforce the technical, business, and leadership
     competencies outlined in the career field‘s developmental templates. They also assure
     that, taken as a whole, promotion plans are logical, consistent, fair, representative of the
     expectations of the career field, and support corporate force development objectives. The
     CFTs maintain responsibility for developing promotion criteria and plans for non-
     centrally managed positions in their individual career fields.
  1.16.5. Acquisition Requirements. Each career field promotion panel determines the
  extent to which promotion plans include relevant acquisition-related requirements.
  Acquisition corps membership and certification level requirements may be included in
  promotion plans when needed to meet applicable statutory and/or regulatory requirements.
  They may also be included in order to achieve the level of professional standards determined
  to be necessary to ensure public confidence and credibility in the acquisition process.
  1.16.6. Acquisition Demonstration Project (AcqDemo). Under the National Defense
  Authorization Act (NDAA) of FY96 as modified by NDAA FY98, AcqDemo was
  implemented across DoD in February 1999 with specific authority to re-engineer personnel
  management practices in order to provide managers increased personnel administration and
  management flexibilities to better manage the Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics
  (AT&L) workforce. These flexibilities include delegated and streamlined position
  classification and assignment processes; a wider range of pay setting; increased candidate
  availability; linking pay and awards to employee performance and contribution to mission
  accomplishment; allowed rapid advancement by eliminating cumbersome promotion
  processes; and expanded training and development opportunities for employees. Refer to
  Federal Register notice 64 FR 1426 (8 Jan 1999) and NDAA FY96 as amended by NDAA
  FY98       for    more     information,   or   the    DoD     AcqDemo        website    at
  http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/ops/acqdemo.html.
26                                                              AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011


  1.16.7. Defense Civilian Intelligence Personnel Management System (DCIPS). DCIPS
  has special authorities for filling positions, details, promotions, and compensation, although
  standard career field promotion plans and assessments are used. Refer to AFI 36-1101,
  Civilian Intelligence Personnel Management System for guidance.
  1.16.8. Whole Person Scores. The use of Whole Person Score (WPS) is addressed in the
  individual career field chapters.
1.17. METHODS OF FILLING POSITIONS.
  1.17.1. CFT Actions. Centrally managed positions are filled through both competitive and
  non-competitive methods. The servicing civilian personnel functional office will issue
  competitive internal certificates and external referral certificates, when requested, for all
  centrally managed positions.
  1.17.2. CPS Actions. The servicing civilian personnel function conducts the fill actions in
  support of temporary appointments, term appointments, and details. They may also fill
  encumbered positions upgraded by classification, as defined in Paragraph 1.20.4.
  1.17.3. Exempting Positions from the Career Field Referral Process. When a special
  one-time exemption from filling a position through normal career field processes is
  necessary, the organization will consult with the servicing CPS before submitting a request to
  exempt the position from the career field‘s central referral process. The request will be
  routed through the MAJCOM to the CFT to the appropriate FM or designee for approval.
  (NOTE: Individual career field chapters in this directive may contain further details.)
  1.17.4. Non-Competitive Methods.
     1.17.4.1. Management Initiated or Directed Assignments. DT Chairs or designees may
     approve management initiated or directed assignments of qualified employees. (NOTE:
     Individual career field chapters in this directive may contain further details.)
     1.17.4.2. Noncompetitive Repromotions. Where an employee, under a permanent
     appointment, has previously held a permanent grade at or above the grade level of a
     position being filled the employee may be non-competitively repromoted. However, the
     appropriate DT Chair must approve all such actions prior to extending a commitment to
     the employee or establishing an effective date for such action.
  1.17.5. Internal Candidates (Competitive). Eligibility to be considered for internal Air
  Force competitive service positions is based on the following:
     1.17.5.1. Permanent Air Force employees in the competitive service currently serving on
     a full-time, part-time, or intermittent appointment.
     1.17.5.2. Permanent Air Force employees currently serving on a full-time, part-time, or
     intermittent appointment, in the excepted service who are eligible for non-competitive
     conversion to a competitive service appointment by virtue of having previously held a
     position in the competitive service.
         1.17.5.2.1. Permanent Air Force employees who are serving on a full-time, part-time,
         or intermittent appointment in the excepted service, and, who have not previously
         held a competitive service appointment may only be considered for centrally
         managed positions in the excepted service (DCIPS positions).
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                        27


  1.17.6. Area of Consideration (Competitive). The normal area of consideration for all
  centrally managed positions is the current DoD permanent employee workforce. There may
  be instances; however, in which an expanded area of consideration is warranted:
     1.17.6.1. Other Federal Employees. The appropriate FM or designee may approve
     extending the normal area of consideration to Federal employees external to the DoD.
     When approved, candidates from external sources must be as well qualified as the
     internal promotion candidates being referred.
     1.17.6.2. Status Applicants. Candidates possessing one or more of the external
     appointment statuses listed on the AFPC/DPI web site are eligible to apply for external
     announcements for centrally managed positions.
     1.17.6.3. DCIPS/AcqDemo. At the onset of recruitment, DCIPS and AcqDemo positions
     may be filled either by internal or external candidates. Prior approval is not needed from
     the CFT, FM or designee.
     1.17.6.4. Consistent Ranking Criteria. When internal and external recruitment sources
     have been exhausted, the CPS/selecting official may return the career program certificate
     without action and request authority to consider candidates from either the AFPC/DEO or
     from OPM. The servicing CPS must use the same ranking criteria in evaluating
     candidates as were used in evaluating internal and external candidates.
1.18. REQUESTING FILL ACTION.
  1.18.1. Clearing the DoD Priority Placement Program (PPP). When filling centrally
  managed positions, it is necessary to comply with DoDI 1400.20, DoD Program for Stability
  of Civilian Employment. In the event of a PPP ―match‖, AFMAN 36-203, Staffing Civilian
  Positions, outlines the specific procedures to be followed.
  1.18.2. Considering Spouse Preference Eligibles. Similarly, the consideration of
  candidates entitled to ―Spouse Preference‖ will be in accordance with the specific procedures
  set forth in AFI 36-203.
  1.18.3. Clearing Career Field Priorities. In addition to observing all statutory and
  regulatory placement priorities, individual career fields may also establish procedures for the
  consideration and placement of certain types of employees in advance of normal methods of
  filling centrally managed positions. Examples of such career field priorities include:
  outplacement of employees completing a career broadening assignment; employees
  completing long term training or other formal training/development programs such as CSLP;
  DT vector assignment lists; employees who have missed consideration, etc.
1.19. COMPETITIVE FILL PROCESS.
  1.19.1. Areas of Consideration. Career field covered positions are filled DoD-wide using
  merit promotion criteria developed by a promotion panel or equivalent group.
  1.19.2. Announcement & Application Process. CFTs use the announcement and
  applications procedures set forth in AFMAN 36-203.
 28                                                                 AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011


   1.19.3. Competitive Promotions.
      1.19.3.1. Rating & Ranking Candidates. Normally, only the best-qualified candidates
      are referred for selection based upon individual qualifications and position requirements.
      Career fields may establish minimum referral criteria and valid job-related evaluation
      criteria that extend beyond the minimum requirements specified by the qualification
      standard to permit meaningful ranking of eligible candidates.
   1.19.4. Competitive Reassignments and Change to Lower Grade or Pay Band. These
   actions use the same process as competitive promotions.
   1.19.5. Referral Certificates. Referral certificates list qualified candidates.
   1.19.6. Supervisor’s Action on Referral Certificates. When making their selection
   decisions, supervisors must comply with any pre-approval requirements outlined in
   succeeding chapters of this directive as they relate to operations within a specific career field.
1.20. FILLING UNIQUE POSITIONS. See area of consideration paragraph 1.17.6 above.
   1.20.1. Joint or Unified Command Positions. Air Force career field teams centrally
   manage positions in Joint or Unified Commands for which the Air Force is the executive
   agent. The FM or designee may grant exceptions to this guidance. Referral by the CFT is the
   sole source of internal and external candidates for permanent fill actions of covered positions.
   If a staffing need is identified to utilize an OPM or DEU certificate and the career field
   approves, the CPS/AFPC servicing staffing team requests assistance from the CFT when
   developing the promotion plan or assessment.
   1.20.2. Excepted Service Positions. When centrally managed positions in the excepted
   service become vacant, the CPS must clear priorities and request referral certificates in the
   same manner as described above for competitive service positions. However, for DCIPS
   positions, the servicing CPS may simultaneously recruit from outside the Air Force. The
   selecting supervisor; however, may select a candidate from any source.
   1.20.3. Temporary Promotions. CPSs may noncompetitively temporarily promote an
   employee for up to 120 days to a centrally managed position. The CPS must notify the
   appropriate CFT prior to effecting any such action. Temporary promotion of more than 120
   days to a centrally managed position requires competition. The servicing civilian personnel
   function will announce the position and issue the referral certificate upon receipt of a
   properly documented RPA. The RPA must identify the area of consideration to be applied to
   the fill action.
   1.20.4. Position Upgraded by Classification. When an encumbered position is being
   upgraded because of accretion of duties, the incumbent is a clear successor, and there are no
   other employee(s) to whom the duties could have been assigned, the CPS may effect the
   promotion without competition. Coordination by the appropriate FM or designee is required
   prior to effecting a noncompetitive promotion. When the position is not a clear successor, or
   there are other employees to whom the duties could have been assigned, the servicing
   civilian personnel function will issue a competitive referral certificate for a limited area of
   consideration as defined by the CPS and IAW AFMAN 36-203, Table 2.1. Such actions may
   be exempt from PPP. The FM or designee may request a position classification review from
   AF/A1P.
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                            29


1.21. MISSED CONSIDERATION FROM A REFERRAL CERTIFICATE. Individuals
will receive priority referral if referral consideration was denied due to errors in the DCPDS data
base or other administrative errors beyond the candidates‘ control. See AFMAN 36-203, Table
2.3 for additional information. If the administrative error is discovered prior to a selection from a
referral certificate, candidates who missed consideration are referred on a supplemental
certificate. If a selection has been made, priority consideration will be granted. Candidates who
claim ―missed consideration‖ due to inaccurate skill coding of their experience records are not
eligible for supplemental referral or priority consideration. Priority consideration terminates
when priority referral is made or 12 months from the date the CFT notifies the employee of
priority referral, whichever is earlier.
1.22. PAY SETTING. Detailed pay setting guidance can be found in AFI 36-802, Pay Setting
or applicable issuances for other pay systems.
   1.22.1. Recruitment, Relocation and Retention Incentives (3Rs): When local funds will
   pay for recruitment or relocation incentive or retention incentive, the CPS will apply the
   procedures outlined in AFI 36-802, Pay Setting.
   1.22.2. Centrally Funded Relocation Incentive Program: The centrally funded relocation
   incentive program is funded, managed and administered by the Air Force Personnel Center's
   Directorate of Civilian Force Integration (AFPC/DPI). The relocation incentive is
   specifically designed as a monetary incentive to increase the interest of high quality
   employees required to PCS to fill positions that are determined to be hard to fill. The
   relocation incentive applies to DoD Candidates and may be used for competitive fill actions,
   management reassignments, and non-competitive re-promotions. Approval authority resides
   with AFPC/DPI. Each incentive paid must be based on a determination that the office
   having the vacancy would encounter substantial difficulty in filling the position without the
   incentive. A centrally funded relocation incentive must be requested through the CFT and
   approved prior to initiating the fill action; the approval must be attached to the RPA when
   submitted for fill/processing. Additionally, the relocation incentive must be approved for the
   selectee IAW AFI 36-802, Pay Setting prior to selectee reporting to new duty station.
1.23. PCS RESTRICTION. Any employee who is serving under a transportation agreement as
a result of a Government-sponsored PCS move is restricted from a second PCS move within a
12-month period (JTR Vol 2). The basis of the restriction is the prudence and cost associated
with moving an employee twice within a 12 month period. Authority to approve a second PCS
move for an employee who has not yet completed 12 months service from a previous move
resides with AFPC/DPI because the centralized PCS funds manager resides within AFPC/DPIF.
If a supervisor selects an employee under such a restriction the supervisor, not the employee,
must provide sufficient justification to support a request for waiver. The waiver request must be
submitted to the selectee‘s owning CFT; it must contain justification to provide sufficient detail
to establish that the request meets the requirements of the Joint Travel Regulation (JTR Vol 2),
in that:
   1.23.1. The proposed transfer is in the Government‘s interest;
   1.23.2. An equally qualified employee is not available within the commuting area of the
   activity concerned; and
30                                                                 AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011


  1.23.3. The losing activity agrees to the transfer. The CFT will review the request to ensure
  the information supports the requested waiver and will forward it to the FM or designee for
  concurrence/non-concurrence and signature. If the FM or designee concurs, the concurrence
  will state specifically that:
     1.23.3.1. The waiver is in the best interests of the career field,
     1.23.3.2. The need to select the employee outweighs the additional cost of a second PCS
     in less than one year, and,
     1.23.3.3. That sufficient efforts were made to locate a candidate for the position who
     would not require a waiver.
  1.23.4. If the DT Chair or designee does not concur, the package will be returned to the
  selecting official advising of the decision. When the DT Chair or designee concurs with the
  waiver, the package is forwarded to AFPC/DPIF through the AFPC/DPIF Resources office
  for approval. The PCS waiver for an employee selected for a position covered by the Air
  Reserve Technician Officer Career Management Program (ARTOCMP) will be submitted
  through AFRC/A1C for decision.
1.24. PCS FUNDING AND RELOCATION SERVICES:
  1.24.1. The gaining CPS will notify the CFT in writing when a selection requires a PCS
  move. The CFT will notify the AFPC PCS Unit to pay PCS costs of selectees as authorized
  by the JTR, Volume 2. The Civilian PCS Account will centrally fund:
     1.24.1.1. The move of an Air Force employee selected for a CFT managed position,
     either from a referral certificate or through a management-initiated assignment, where
     approved in advance by the FM or designee.
     1.24.1.2. The move of an individual selected from a certificate if the person is a current
     Federal employee.
     1.24.1.3. The first-duty station move for an external reinstatement eligible applicant for a
     "hard-to-fill" position (upon CFT request).
     1.24.1.4. A return PCS when the Civilian PCS Account funded the move of an employee
     to an overseas location or U.S. territory, except where the return is through PPP.
     1.24.1.5. The return move of an employee who retires overseas when the Civilian PCS
     Account funded the initial overseas move.
     1.24.1.6. Temporary quarters subsistence expense (TQSE) and miscellaneous expenses
     of an employee returning from another component in an overseas area or a U.S. territory
     to a stateside CFT managed position, except when effected through PPP.
  1.24.2. Contracted relocation services are available to current eligible Federal employees
  who are required to PCS and need assistance with selling their residence at the old Permanent
  Duty Station (PDS) and/or finding a residence at the new PDS. Defense Management Review
  Decision (DMRD) 974, dated 15 December 1992, consolidated all Department of Defense
  (DoD) relocation services into the DoD National Relocation Program (DNRP). DNRP
  operates in accordance with a contract with multiple relocation companies. DNRP services
  currently available are the Destination Services and the Guaranteed Homesale Services
  (GHS). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is the DoD Executive Agent. The
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                      31


  National Relocation Program Office (NRPO) located in the USACE Baltimore District Real
  Estate Division administers the DNRP. The toll-free telephone number is 1-800-344-2501.
  The DNRP handbook is available at http://www.nab.usace.army.mil/dnrp/.
     1.24.2.1. Destination Services. Services include home finding for buyers and renters as
     well as mortgage counseling.
        1.24.2.1.1. Call DNRP at toll free 1-800-344-2501 for additional information about
        the services.
        1.24.2.1.2. Destination Services Eligibility: An employee may use Destination
        Services regardless of whether GHS is used. Destination services are provided at no
        cost to the Air Force.
     1.24.2.2. Guaranteed Homesale Services (GHS). These services include an appraised
     value offer, home closing, and home marketing assistance. The goal is to obtain a market-
     based offer - Amended Value (AV) or Buyer Value Option (BVO) – at a price equal to or
     better than the appraised value offer. The GHS appraised value offer is based on the
     average of two market value appraisals, if the two appraisal values are within the
     approved variance of 10%. If the values do not fall within the 10% variance, a third
     appraisal is ordered. The GHS offer will be the average of the two appraisals or all three
     if they are equally distant. An employee is required to market the home for at least 60
     days from the date of the listing after authorization for DNRP services before the
     employee can accept the DoD Relocation Contractor GHS offer.
        1.24.2.2.1. GHS Eligibility. The program is available to current Federal employees
        selected for an Air Force Senior Executive Service (SES) or CFT centrally managed
        position. For General Schedule positions, the supervisor must make a selection at the
        GS-12 grade level or higher. An employee selected for a position in other
        appropriated fund pay banding systems is eligible if the final base salary will be set
        equivalent to GS-12, step 1 or higher. The move must be from one location to another
        in the United States, (including Alaska and Hawaii), the Canal Zone area, or a U. S.
        territory or possession (such as Guam). Additionally, an employee who returns from a
        completed tour of duty from a foreign area to a non-foreign area different than the
        one from which transferred may be eligible for the program per Joint Travel
        Regulations (JTR), Volume 2, Chapter 5, Part P, Section 1, Paragraph C5750-D
        (employees who traveled overseas on a first duty station move and employees who
        were hired locally overseas are not eligible).
        1.24.2.2.2. Application Procedures. An employee who meets the eligibility
        requirements in paragraph 1.24.2.2.1 above must submit the Relocation Services
        Request Form – Appendix 1, Addendum to Listing Agreement – Appendix 2, (both
        from the DNRP Handbook), a copy of the Listing Agreement (if already available),
        and a copy of the PCS travel order to AFPC/DPIF to start the DNRP process.
        Applicants may fax the forms to Commercial 210-565-2445 or DSN 665-2445 or e-
        mail the signed and scanned forms to the AFPC/DPIFS Resources Office workflow
        inbox      afpc.dpiea.resources.office@randolph.af.mil.         AFPC/DPIF   will
        review/approve the enrollment application, and forward to the DNRP office for
        further actions with one of the contractor companies. In turn, a DNRP services
        counselor will contact the employee and explain the available services.
32                                                          AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011


     1.24.2.2.3. Additional Criteria. An employee's residence (former residence for
     overseas returnees from a foreign area) must meet the requirements under the JTR,
     Volume 2, Chapter 5, Part P, Paragraph C5750-B. According to DNRP guidelines
     (DNRP Handbook, Sec. 7, Paragraph IID note), the residence must be the employee's
     principal residence and cannot be a mobile home, houseboat, or cooperative. The
     residence must be the place from which the employee regularly (daily) commutes to
     and from work. The residence must be titled in the name of the employee and/or one
     or more dependents. In situations involving a divorce or separation, or title held with
     other than a dependent, contact AFPC/DPIF for further information regarding limited
     pro rata reimbursement. The maximum home value for which home sale services are
     payable is $750,000 per JTR Volume 2, Chapter 5, Part Q1, Paragraph C5810-D. It is
     DoD policy that an employee is responsible for any additional costs to the contractor
     relocation company if the home is sold using GHS at a price exceeding $750,000.
     1.24.2.2.4. Enrollment Time Limit. An eligible employee must elect to use GHS at
     the time the employee accepts the new position in conjunction with the PCS. The
     employee's option to choose this program expires 45 days from the date all
     dependents travel and household goods (HHG) are shipped, when delayed dependent
     travel is authorized, but not to exceed the two-year limit IAW JTR, Volume 2,
     Chapter 1, Paragraph C1057. Otherwise, the employee's option to choose this
     program expires 45 days from the date of the personnel action that required the PCS
     (i.e., SF 50), when no delayed dependent travel is authorized.
     1.24.2.2.5. Delayed Use of GHS. An applicant must submit a request for delayed use
     of the program to AFPC/DPIF within 45 days from the date all dependents travel and
     household goods (HHG) are shipped, when delayed dependent travel is authorized,
     but not to exceed the two-year limit IAW JTR, Volume 2, Chapter 1, Paragraph
     C1057. Otherwise, when no delayed dependent travel is authorized, an applicant
     must submit a request for delayed use of the program within 45 days of the effective
     date of the personnel action that required the PCS (i.e., SF 50). Submit the request to
     AFPC/DPIF, and specifically explain the reason(s) for requesting the delay (such as,
     serious illness or death of immediate family member or employee, children in school,
     and/or intervening TDY/training). Requests must include a copy of PCS orders and
     all amendments plus any documentation that supports the request.
     1.24.2.2.6. Listing the Property. DoD requires that an eligible employee who elects
     to use GHS must market the home for sixty (60) days (from date of listing) prior to
     accepting the GHS offer. The listing agreement must include an exclusion clause to
     allow the employee to cancel the agreement without incurring a broker‘s commission
     should the employee elect to accept the appraised value offer. The clause also permits
     the employee to assign an offer to the contractor relocation company to relieve them
     of the responsibility of closing the sale with the buyer.
     1.24.2.2.7. Home Marketing Incentive Payment (HMIP). An employee who is
     authorized a PCS and who meets GHS eligibility requirements may be authorized the
     Home Marketing Incentive Payment (HMIP). To qualify for the HMIP, an employee
     must: 1) enter the residence in GHS; 2) independently and aggressively market the
     residence; 3) find a bona fide buyer for the residence as a result of independent
     marketing efforts; 4) transfer the residence to the contractor relocation company
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                     33


        through which the buyer completes the sale. Upon completion of these requirements,
        the Air Force ordering-authorizing or authenticating official will issue the employee
        an HMIP payout based on the sale price of the residence. In accordance with JTR,
        Vol 2, Chapter 5, Part Q, Paragraph C5849, the maximum HMIP may not exceed the
        least of a) five percent (5%), b) $10,000 or c) one half the savings realized from the
        reduced fee paid to the relocation contractor as a result of the employee finding a
        bona fide buyer with whom the sale is closed. If no savings are realized, a home
        marketing incentive may not be paid.
        1.24.2.2.8. Alternative to the JTR. GHS provides an employee with an alternative to
        the direct method of reimbursement authorized when an employee sells a home at a
        former duty station coincident with a PCS. It provides an employee with an
        opportunity to accept "fair market value" for the home, relieves the employee from
        having to sell the home, and eliminates the lengthy process of requesting and
        receiving reimbursement for expenses under the JTR.
        1.24.2.2.9. Group Move GHS Services. AF/A1PA will approve GHS services for
        group moves on a case-by-case basis. Group moves include, but are not limited to,
        transfers of function, realignments, reorganizations, or transfers unrelated to base
        closure, even if the employees do not move at the same time.
        1.24.2.2.10. BRAC Moves. BRAC funds cover the cost of civilian PCS moves from
        bases closing or realigning as a result of a recommendation directed in the Defense
        Base Closure and Realignment Commission report. This includes centrally managed
        moves from closing bases and transfer of function moves. In addition, BRAC funds
        cover GHS costs for Air Force employees moving to centrally managed positions
        within the United States and its territories or possessions as a result of BRAC.
     1.24.2.3. Property Management Services. An employee transferring to a centrally
     managed position assigned in a foreign area, who meets the eligibility requirements in
     paragraph 1.24.2.2.1, is eligible for Property Management (PM) services. An employee
     can self procure PM services through a rental agency and be reimbursed up to 10 percent
     of the monthly rent in accordance with the JTR, Volume 2, Chapter 5, Part Q1, Paragraph
     C5815-B2. The Air Force ordering-authorizing or authenticating official may approve
     PM services. An employee who elects to use PM services may later sell the residence
     within the applicable time limits in accordance with JTR Volume 2, Chapter 5, Part P,
     Paragraph C5750-C. However, an employee may not use GHS pursuant to the same PCS
     orders. The reimbursement amount an employee receives for the sale of a residence may
     not exceed the maximum amount allowed in Part P, Paragraph C5756-B1 less the amount
     paid for PM services. If the amount paid for PM services equals/exceeds the maximum
     amount allowed in Paragraph C5756-B1, then no reimbursement is allowed for the
     residence sale.

Section E - Training and Development
1.25. ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITIES.
   1.25.1. Career Field Teams (CFTs) - CFTs centrally administer managerial/leadership
   training and development for career field employees and interns. This training and
   development includes selected career broadening and career enhancing assignments, job
   rotation, short and long-term training, management and executive seminars, education, and
   self-improvement activities intended to systematically develop employees for filling Air
   Force positions of increased responsibility.
   1.25.2. Local Base Training Offices retain the responsibility for funding and administering
   tactical level training, such as that required for job proficiency.
   1.25.3. CFT Training & Development Course Listing.               The AFPC/DPI Leadership
   Development office updates the AFPC website with courses offered, nomination due dates,
   specific eligibility criteria, and application procedures for all training and development
   opportunities offered by the CFTs.
1.26. MASTER DEVELOPMENT PLAN (MDP). Each career field develops a MDP for its
career families. It serves as a guide to current or future job-related experience, training, and
education important for highly successful performance and career progression. The MDP covers
suggested entry-level training and development, special projects, cross-training, career
broadening assignments, active participation in professional associations, including certification
and licenses, etc. Each MDP also includes recommended training and experiences important for
developing technical and managerial competencies required by executive-level positions. The
MDP should be the basis for all training requirements and the development of formal training
plans. Contact the individual CFTs and/or the CFTs website for individual MDPs.
1.27. CAREER PATHS. CFTs develop and maintain career planning diagrams which
represent specific progression possibilities from entry level positions up to career positions at the
Secretary of the Air Force level. Individual career field chapters may contain specific career
planning diagrams, or refer to the AF career planning diagram at Attachment 4.
1.28. FUNDING. The AF centrally funds key training and development opportunities for
career fields. AF/A1P is the program element manager for all AF civilian training funds, and
they provide AFPC with budget authority for their programs. AFPC/DPI Resource section
submits budgets and financial plans based on requirements developed by individual CFTs as well
as the needs of other centrally managed programs. CFTs and other centrally managed programs
prioritize their training requirements and submit their requests through AFPC/DPIF, who
processes those requests, pays training providers, and tracks overall training funds.
1.29. CONTINUED SERVICE AGREEMENT (CSA). A CSA is required for any training
over 80 hours duration with a minimum payback of three times the length of training. Refer to
AFI 36-401, Employee Training and Development, for specific guidance. AFPC/DPI will
initiate a CSA for all employees who attend training over 80 hours that is funded or managed by
CFTs. The employee is required to sign and return the CSA to AFPC/DPI prior to class start
date.
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                           35


1.30. REPAYMENT OF TRAINING FUNDS. Employees who fail to attend or successfully
complete scheduled training due to circumstances within their control must reimburse the Air
Force for all training costs (excluding salary) associated with their attendance. The final training
approval authority (AFPC/DPI) may waive this requirement in whole, or in part, based on the
employee's justification.
1.31. SELECTION PROCEDURES. Based on AF guidance and competitive selection
procedures, each career field develops procedures to select employees for both short-term (less
than 120 days) and long-term (over 120 days) training.
1.32. EXECUTIVE AND MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT. Based on AF guidance and
merit promotion guidelines, career fields develop and implement a process to identify and
develop exceptional employees to meet future needs for executives and managers, using some or
all of the programs addressed in Section F of this guide. Due to the strategic importance and the
investment of resources to develop Air Force managers and executives, the Civilian Force
Development Panel (CFDP) will meet twice annually to monitor and discuss development and
experiential programs to ensure that DT selection processes are providing the highest quality
candidates into these programs. In addition, the CFDP will track DT outplacement efforts and
intervene when necessary to effect outplacement assignments consistent with corporate needs
and DT vectors. While these will not be ―forced‖ placements into MAJCOM-owned billets,
CFDP members and senior functional leaders may utilize influence within their communities to
assist in placing these highly trained candidates who have been vetted and selected using
competitive boarding procedures. Proactive placement results in ―win-win‖ for both the gaining
organization and the enterprise as these corporately developed leaders move on to challenging
positions and the Air Force realizes force development ROI.
1.33. LONG-TERM TRAINING (LTT). Long-term training is full-time, in-residence, off-
the-job training that consists of more than 120 consecutive duty days accomplished either in
government or non-government facilities. The intent of LTT is to develop selected employees in
order to keep the AF abreast of professional, managerial, technical and scientific achievements.
Available programs include, but are not limited to, those offered through Civilian Developmental
Education (CDE), (i.e., Professional Military Education or PME, fellowships and specific college
graduate programs). They may also include attendance at the Air Force Institute of Technology
(AFIT) graduate programs, Education With Industry (EWI), or programs tailored to the specific
needs of a career field.
1.34. CIVILIAN DEVELOPMENTAL EDUCATION (CDE). Most long term civilian
education and development is offered through CDE (AFI 36-2301, Developmental Education).
CDE includes long-term academic programs at major universities, experiential programs such as
the DoD Executive Leadership Development Program, the Excellence in Government Fellows
and RAND Fellowships, PME, and Executive Development Programs. PME includes both
Intermediate and Senior Service Schools. TDY costs for CDE employees are centrally funded.
Salaries of individuals selected for LTT through CDE are funded through the Central Salary
Account, enabling management to fill behind the selectee during the period of LTT. All eligible
AF employees may apply for these programs.
 36                                                                AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011


   1.34.1. Competitive Selection. Nominations for CDE are solicited in the spring of each
   year. Employees must submit an AF Form 4059, Air Force Civilian Competitive
   Development Nomination, or electronic nomination form, signed by their supervisor and
   endorsed by their wing commander (or equivalent with senior rater authority) or the first
   SES/general officer in their chain of command. The DT is responsible for recommending
   specific courses, rank-ordering applicants for various programs, and providing meaningful
   outplacement assignments upon graduation. Nominees are then evaluated by a board
   comprised of senior executives/general officers representing the various functional
   communities, who rate candidates for selection and determine which courses or development
   opportunities selectees will attend. The Developmental Education Designation Board
   (DEDB) approves selections.
   1.34.2. Continued Service Agreement (CSA). A CSA is required for all CDE programs
   and courses. Employees sign the Air Force CSA, Attachment 11 of AFI 36-401. The
   continued service period does not begin until the first duty day following completion of the
   program or course. The standard service commitments for CDE are as follows:
       1.34.2.1. Short-term Executive Development – 1 year
       1.34.2.2. Long-term programs less than $40,000 – 3 years
       1.34.2.3. Long-term programs between $40,000 and $59,999 – 4 years
       1.34.2.4. Long-term programs $60,000 or more - 5 years
   1.34.3. LTT Follow-on Assignment. Employees attending LTT through CDE are expected
   to move to positions that best utilize their newly acquired skills and meet the mission needs
   of the Air Force. The endorsing official on the AF Form 4059, or electronic nomination
   form, recommends an appropriate follow-on assignment which is either validated by the DT
   or the DT will recommend an optional outplacement assignment. The career field team and
   DT are responsible for outplacement of the employee. Refer to AFI 36-2640, chapter 3, for
   specific outplacement guidance.
1.35. TUITION ASSISTANCE (TA). Tuition assistance is funding for tuition and course-
related fees for accredited college and university courses taken either during duty or non-duty
hours. It is distinguished from long-term training that is defined as training during duty hours of
over 120 consecutive days. The following outlines Air Force guidance on administration of the
program for Air Force civilian CFT eligibles in both acquisition and non-acquisition related
fields.
   1.35.1. Civilian Tuition Assistance Program (CTAP). CTAP was implemented in
   October 1999 as an Air Force quality of life priority. This guidance is designed to ensure
   standardization and provide equity for all employees. Interns, such as PALACE Acquire
   and COPPER CAP are covered under AFI 36-602, Civilian Intern Programs, and are not
   subject to the CTAP guidance. CTAP guidance is found in AFI 36-401 Chapter 9. CTAP
   differs from training because employees rather than management identify requirements,
   choice, share in the cost, and attend on a voluntary off-duty basis. Normally, TA is not
   provided for courses at the post-masters level or at a level lower or equal to a degree already
   attained.
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                            37


  1.35.2. Acquisition Tuition Assistance. Tuition assistance (TA) for personnel assigned to
  Acquisition Personnel Development Program (APDP) coded positions is funded by
  acquisition funds to meet education requirements under the Defense Acquisition Work Force
  Improvement Act (DAWIA) and not subject to CTAP guidance. AFPC/DPI administers an
  automated TA system for all acquisition employees IAW SAF/AQXD policy.
  1.35.3. Mission-Related. All courses for which TA is requested must be related to the job
  or the mission of the organization, must improve individual or organizational performance
  and must assist an agency in achieving its mission or performance goals by improving
  employee skills. CFTs determine whether courses are mission or job-related. Mission
  related education does not include courses in religion, art, physical education, music
  philosophy, literature or history (except for the Historian CFT). Courses in written and oral
  communication, business ethics and values, math, and business management are appropriate.
  1.35.4. Tuition and Fees. Under CTAP guidance, CFTs use a standard rate of 75% of
  tuition costs not to exceed $187.50 per semester hour or $124.50 per quarter hour and is
  limited to $3500 per fiscal year. Table 188 codes ―NTU‖ for undergraduate and ―BTG‖ for
  graduate are used for documentation. Servicing training offices should also use these codes
  to record CTAP completions in the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS).
  Individual program managers for each CFT have the flexibility to establish a lower standard
  annual rate based on the total number of employees who have identified CTAP requirements
  and available funds. The Air Force does not pay for non-instructional costs (i.e. books,
  health insurance, registration, athletic fees, library, parking, food, housing, laundry, etc.), but
  may fund laboratory and other course related fees. Purchase of supplies is the personal
  responsibility of each employee. Costs for vicinity travel are not funded. TA is not
  provided, in whole or in part, for courses for which the employee is receiving other federal or
  state tuition subsidies such as Veterans Administration educational benefits, scholarships or
  grants, etc. CTAP limits apply to all sources of money; other government organizations
  cannot cover the remaining 25% of tuition costs. Funding is limited and submission of a
  mission-related request for TA does not mean automatic approval. Employees should not
  attend any classes until CFTs have approved funding documents.
  1.35.5. Eligibility. CFTs may fund eligible permanent appropriated-fund employees under
  the CTAP and AFPC/DPI administers the program. TA for all other employees is
  administered by servicing training offices, regardless of funding source.
  1.35.6. Examination Fees. CFTs do not pay for examination costs, professional
  certification fees, or charges related to accrediting work or life experiences. Specifically, TA
  is not used for the costs of the College Level Examination Program (CLEP), Graduate
  Management Admissions Test (GMAT), Graduate Records Examination (GRE), Law School
  Admission Test (LSAT), Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT), Standard Achievement
  Test (SAT), or Admissions College Test (ACT) examinations, nor is it appropriate to use TA
  to transfer credits from one institution to another. For qualified acquisition employees,
  Defense Activity for Non-Traditional Education Support (DANTES) testing is provided free
  of charge.
38                                                                AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011


  1.35.7. Dual Compensation. The law (5 U.S.C. 1781) governing veterans‘ educational
  assistance prohibits the payment of an educational assistance allowance to an employee who
  is attending training paid for under the Government Employees Training Act (GETA) and
  whose full salary is paid while in training. The Veterans Affairs agency considers an
  employee as being in a full salary status while in training when he or she is a part or full time
  employee receiving full salary payment during the calendar period in which the training
  occurs. Such an employee would be subject to the prohibition described above, regardless of
  whether the training occurs during duty hours or after duty hours.
  1.35.8. How to apply for Tuition Assistance.
     1.35.8.1. SF 182, Authorization, Agreement and Certification of Training. To apply for
     TA, an employee must submit an SF 182 with Block 4, home address with nine-digit zip
     code, completed, to the immediate supervisor for signature in Section D - Approvals
     Blocks 1a thru 1e prior to the course start date. Section D - Approvals Blocks 2a thru 2e
     and 3a thru 3e are to be left blank for authorization by the CFT manager and training
     officer. In addition to the SF 182, the following is required to make a complete training
     package:
         1.35.8.1.1. A course description for each class, copied from the course catalog or
         website
         1.35.8.1.2. A signed TA agreement. The agreement can be obtained from the CFT
     1.35.8.2. Submission to AFPC/DPI. Submit SF 182 with attachments directly to the
     CFT by the dates established. All correspondence must include last four digits of
     nominee‘s Social Security Account Number (SSAN). Each CFT makes final selections
     and notifications. Funding is often limited and submission of a request for TA does not
     mean automatic approval.
     1.35.8.3. Application Dates. Nominations are to reach AFPC/DPI (individual CFTs) by
     the dates specified. If additional funds become available later in the fiscal year, a CFT
     may make an additional TA call. Applications received after the suspense dates are
     considered as funds are available. Questions should be directed to the CFT.
         1.35.8.3.1. Employees should not attend the course without prior approval (funded
         SF 182, Section E - Approval/Concurrence is signed)
  1.35.9. Procedures. The following rules must be followed in order to retain funding.
  Failure to comply will result in nonpayment of tuition, termination from the tuition assistance
  program, and no additional funding.
     1.35.9.1. Courses must be completed by the date in Section B - Training Course Data,
     block 4 of the SF 182. If circumstances require a deviation from the dates listed, notify
     the CFT immediately via fax or email.
     1.35.9.2. If a deviation from the approved course list (Section B - Training Course Data,
     Blocks 2a and 2b on the SF 182) is required, request approval from the CFT before
     starting the course. Changes to the approved course list must be accomplished in writing
     to the CFT. TA is paid only for courses approved by the CFT in advance of registration
     or class start date.
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                         39


       1.35.9.3. Employee pays for a course taken when approval to enroll in the course was not
       granted by the CFT prior to course start date.
       1.35.9.4. Employee pays for any CFT funded course when:
           1.35.9.4.1. Course is dropped.
           1.35.9.4.2. Employee withdraws from a course.
           1.35.9.4.3. Employee does not complete a course.
           1.35.9.4.4. Employee does not make a ―C‖ or higher in an undergraduate course.
           1.35.9.4.5. Employee does not make a ―B‖ or higher in a graduate course.
       1.35.9.5. Grade Requirements. A copy of grades (fax acceptable) must be sent to the
       CFT upon completion of each course. Delay in providing a grade report delays the
       funding of current enrollment or delays payment of tuition charges billed to the CFT.
       The employee is responsible for maintaining academic standing, and for satisfactorily
       completing approved courses. Satisfactory completion requires a minimum grade of ―C‖
       for undergraduate level courses and a minimum grade of ―B‖ for graduate level courses.
       1.35.9.6. When unable to attend courses, the employee must call the CFT immediately in
       order to allow the CFT to make those funds available elsewhere.
       1.35.9.7. Employees must present SF 182(s), approved by the CFT, to the institution at
       the time of enrollment for the institution to use in billing the CFT directly.
1.36. INTERN PROGRAMS. AFI 36-602, Civilian Intern Programs, addresses the various
intern programs (i.e., COPPER CAP, PALACE Acquire, etc.), and the methods and procedures
for recruiting, selecting, training, evaluating, promoting, and separating CFTs interns.
Section F - Acquisition Professional Development Program (APDP)
1.37. CONCEPT. The Defense Acquisition Work Force Improvement Act (DAWIA),
November 1990, provided centralized management and professional development, education,
training, and career opportunities to the acquisition work force. In order to maintain the highest
professional standards among acquisition work force members, requirements in education,
training and experience were established for every type of acquisition position. The
requirements are listed in AFI 63-101, Chap 5, Acquisition Workforce Management and
Professional Development and AFI 36-1301 (DODD5000.52), Management of Acquisition Key
Leadership Positions. Specific information may be found on the SAF/AQ APDP web site.
1.38. CAREER FIELD TEAM (CFT) ROLES. The Acquisition-related CFTs within
AFPC/DPI are responsible for ensuring DAWIA and DoD requirements are considered in the
competitive processes for centrally managed acquisition positions; performing quality reviews of
records of employees certified to ensure consistency across command lines; and answering or
resolving questions concerning creditable experience or training. CFTs must ensure the legal
requirements of DAWIA are met when filling acquisition positions. DAWIA requirements that
must be met for acquisition positions to include the appropriate APDP certification level in the
correct functional discipline, Acquisition Corps membership for critical acquisition positions,
and statutory requirements for Key Leadership Positions. DT Chairs may require CFT review of
waiver requests prior to submission to the Director of Acquisition Career Management (DACM).

Section G - Grievances and Complaints
1.39. PROCESSING. All complaints (other than EEO complaints), grievances, and appeals
concerning career field issues must be submitted to and reviewed by the local servicing civilian
personnel function for regulatory compliance and guidance. Those from non-bargaining unit
employees concerning career field issues are referred to the appropriate CFT for action. The
CFT Chief makes the final decision, if he or she has the authority to adjust the matter. If not,
they refer the grievance or complaint to the appropriate career field official with authority at a
higher organizational level than any person involved or having a direct interest in the matter.
Bargaining unit employees must follow the local negotiated grievance procedure, if one exists, to
request review of decisions related to the career fields. EEO complaints regarding administration
of career field issues are to be handled in accordance with AFPD 36-27, Equal Opportunity (EO)
and AFI 36-2706, Military Equal Opportunity (MEO) Program.
1.40. SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES. Settlement negotiations in a local dispute involving a
career field‘s policies or positions must receive the coordination and approval of the career
field‘s DT Chair and the Director, AFPC/DPI, prior to finalizing the agreement. Settlement
agreements without this required approval are not binding on the career field. This includes the
placement of an individual into a centrally managed position as part of the settlement agreement.
If such action occurs without the prior approval of the career field, the CPS will be required to
reverse the action, unless they subsequently obtain approval from the DT Chair.
Section H - Program Evaluation
1.41. PERIODIC EVALUATION. Periodic evaluation is accomplished by functional chiefs or
managers and each career field Functional Advisory Council. Self-evaluation by AFPC/DPI and
CFTs is based on an analysis of progress in meeting stated career field Functional Advisory
Council objectives, to include defining customer requirements, analyzing performance of work
processes, and implementing measures to streamline and continuously improve personnel
management servicing.
1.42. OVERSEAS EMPLOYMENT. See AFMAN 36-204, Overseas Employment, for
complete information on overseas employment and return placement programs as they relate to
employees in centrally managed positions.
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                     41

     PROGRAM MANAGEMENT CAREER FIELD MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

2.1. FUNCTIONAL ADVISORY COUNCIL (FAC) STRUCTURE. The Program
Management Career Field Management Program (PMCFMP) Advisory Council provides
oversight of the program management workforce. The Advisory Council addresses force
development and career field management initiatives and issues impacting the entire program
management career field. This includes ensuring the workforce is being developed in a manner
to produce effective leaders through planned development activities, and ensuring career paths
are clear and compatible with opportunities and the needs of the Air Force. The PMCFMP
Career Field Team (AFPC/DPIBG) and Military Assignments Team (AFPC/DPASA) present
workforce issues for resolution through the Career Field Manager.
   2.1.1. ADVISORY COUCNIL COMPOSITION
       2.1.1.1. Co-Chaired by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition
       Integration, SAF/AQX, or a delegated representative

   formulate various enhancement and development initiatives, identify concerns, and provide
   recommendations. Senior acquisition personnel from across the Air Force, with support from
   the CFT, participate on the panels.
2.2. CIVILIAN DEVELOPMENT TEAMS (DTs). The Functional Manager establishes
development teams to provide and execute education, training, and experience vectors to foster
development of employees in the PMCFMP. Two permanent DTs are established:
   2.2.1. Senior Level. The PMCFMP Advisory Council serves as the Senior Level DT and
   vectors GS-14/15 and equivalent employees. This team also assesses candidates for Air
   Force-wide competitive development programs.
   2.2.2. Intermediate Level. A panel composed of GS-15 and equivalent members
   designated by respective PMCFMP Advisory Council members vectors GS-13 and
   equivalent employees who meet the technical breadth and depth anchors. This team is
   chaired by the Career Field Manager, SAF/AQXD, or designee.
 42                                                               AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011


2.3. CENTRALIZED CAREER FIELD REFERRAL. An individual must meet the
requirements imposed by the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) for
assignment to an Acquisition-coded position. Only eligible members of the Acquisition Corps
can fill Critical Acquisition Positions (CAP). The CFT screens Acquisition Corps eligibility in
identifying candidates for CAP positions. Candidates are also required to meet or be able to
meet the Acquisition Professional Development Program‘s (APDP) certification requirements of
the position within 24 months of assignment. Further detail on APDP requirements is in
Chapter 1, Section G.
   2.3.1. Sources of Candidates. The PMCFMP centralized referral process is the primary
   source for internal and external candidates for centrally-managed positions. Consistent with
   DoD issuances, external sources, in addition to Air Force candidates, are referred to fill
   covered positions in Joint or Unified Commands, where Air Force is the executive agent.
   2.3.2. Standardized Air Force-wide Promotion Plans. Standardized Air Force-wide
   Promotion Plans are used in filling all centrally-managed positions. These plans may use
   professional credentials as quality ranking/referral factors for promotion and competitive
   reassignment. The Advisory Council approves the credentials and weighting used in the
   Promotion Plans.
2.4. MANAGEMENT INITIATED RE-ASSIGNMENTS (MIRs). To foster geographic
mobility and broadening of the PMCFMP workforce, MIRs within the career field are locally
approved. MIRs into centrally managed positions from outside the career field must meet
predetermined PMCFMP requirements. CFM approval is required for all waivers, through the
CFT.
2.5. LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT. Refer to Section 1.14 for information on Leadership
Development.
2.6. TRAINING & DEVELOPMENT. The CFT sponsors/administers training and education
classes and programs.
   2.6.1. Formal Training. The PMCFMP sponsors training courses to satisfy Continuing
   Learning and Training guidance and further managerial and executive development. On-site
   management and leadership courses are sponsored where there is a highly concentrated
   interest and need. Long-term training and development opportunities may require the
   individual to sign a mobility agreement so that the trainee can be out-placed to an available
   PMCP position at the completion of training.
   2.6.2. Tuition Assistance. APDP offers tuition assistance to individuals on APDP-coded
   positions attending accredited universities. The APDP tuition assistance guidance is not
   subject to the Civilian Tuition assistance Program (CTAP).
   2.6.3. Career Broadening. The PMCFMP will administer centrally managed career
   broadening positions through the CFT, subject to CFM and Advisory Council guidance.
   When selected for assignment to a career broadening position, the career broadener will serve
   a period of two to three years, followed by an assignment to a position that may or may not
   be at their original location. Individuals selected for career broadening positions must sign a
   mobility agreement prior to final selection.
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                       43


       2.6.3.1. Filling Career Broadening Positions. The organization receiving the position
       will submit a proposed position description, organizational chart, functional statement,
       and developmental plan to the CFT for review before forwarding to AFMA for
       classification. Normally, career broadening positions will be filled based on DT vectors.
       A competitive procedure may be used to fill career broadening positions, and may
       include reassignment, change-to-lower-grade, or temporary promotion.
   2.6.4. Master Development Plan/Developmental Template. The PMCFMP develops and
   maintains a Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) and career paths to guide
   individuals toward the experience, education, and training important for successful
   performance and career progression. The Career Paths recommend education and self-
   development activities, acquisition certification levels, desired training, and typical
   assignments for entry-level, mid-level, and senior-level acquisition/program managers.
   Career Paths may be found on the Program Management Career Field Force Development

   5.1.1. Force Management and Development Council and Sub-panels. The Force
   Management and Development Council (FMDC) is chaired by the Vice Chief of Staff. This
   forum provides an institutional perspective and makes strategic recommendations on AF-
   wide force management and development issues. The FMDC also has supporting Officer,
   Enlisted and Civilian Development Panels as well as an Air Force Learning Council and
56                                                               AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011


  Emerging Issues Panel. As the C&I Functional Authority, SAF/A6 CIO is a member of the
  FMDC. As the senior civilian within SAF/A6, the A6 deputy is a member of the Civilian
  Force Development Panel.
  5.1.2. C&I Functional Authority. The C&I Functional Authority (SAF/A6 CIO) is
  appointed by the Secretary of the Air Force and provides oversight and functional advisory
  services related to the C&I community.
  5.1.3. C&I Functional Advisory Council. The C&I Functional Advisory Council (FAC) is
  chaired by the Functional Authority (FA) and provides guidance in areas of institutional
  civilian, officer and enlisted force management and development guidance. This council is
  primarily made up of MAJCOM A6s. Additionally, the FAC provides institutional force
  management and development recommendations allowing the identification of requirements
  to support programmatic decisions and providing senior leader guidance regarding the focus
  and subject matter of Air Force programs designed to recruit, develop and retain a total force.
  5.1.4. C&I Civilian Advisory Panel. The C&I Civilian Advisory Panel (CAP) is chaired
  by SAF/A6-2. This senior civilian panel provides input to the C&I FAC and prepares
  civilian issues for FAC discussion and decisions. The C&I CAP will meet at least quarterly
  in advance of the C&I FAC. Many of these senior civilians also participate in portions of the
  annual C&I Civilian Working Groups described below.
     5.1.4.1. Positions Management Working Group (PMWG): The PMWG deliberately
     manages AF C&I civilian force structure through the development of guidance,
     strategies, and other actions for recommendation to the CAP to ensure a current and
     future workforce capable of delivering air, space and cyber superiority.
     5.1.4.2. Civilian Education and Training Working Group (E&TWG): provides
     strategic oversight as it pertains to C&I civilian force development—how the AF
     develops and trains the C&I civilian force. It deliberately develops AF C&I civilians in
     support of Total Force Development and consistent with AF development strategies. The
     panel develops guidance, strategies, and other actions for recommendation to the CAP to
     ensure a current and future workforce capable of delivering air and space superiority.
     5.1.4.3. Recruitment and On-ramping Working Group (R&OWG): works directly
     with the CICFT to identify and manage C&I intern programs and to identify participants
     for inclusion into AF and career field level programs.
  5.1.5. C&I Functional Manager. The C&I Functional Manager (FM) (SAF/A6O) is
  designated by the C&I FA and provides day-to-day management responsibility of the C&I
  functional community. The FM is responsible for ensuring the specialties are equipped,
  developed and sustain to provide AF capabilities as defined in AFI 36-2640.
  5.1.6. C&I Development Team. The C&I Development Team (DT) is chaired by the FM
  or designee and provides oversight of military and civilian leadership positions and the
  leadership development process of military officers and civilian employees. This team is
  made up of C&I career field general officers, senior executive service civilians and
  MAJCOM/A6 representation. It provides oversight through career vectoring, identifying
  appropriate outplacement from Developmental Education (DE), Career Broadening, and
  other special programs and/or assignments.
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                       57


   5.1.7. C&I Career Field Manager (CFM). The C&I Career Field Management (CFM)
   (SAF/A6OD) responsibilities are split into officer, enlisted and civilian duties. The CFM(s)
   shall be appointed by the FA and are responsible for implementing policies, providing central
   oversight for education, training and accessions.
   5.1.8. C&I Civilian Working Group. The Civilian Working Group (CWG) is a working
   level forum consisting of representation from the MAJCOM/DRU/FOA A6 organizations.
   Formed December 2008, this group of seasoned C&I civilians from A6 staffs works with the
   C&I Force Development team to tackle hot-topic issues and downward directed tasking. The
   group holds monthly (or as necessary) teleconferences and an annual conference.
   5.1.9. C&I Career Field Team. The Air Force Personnel Center‘s (AFPC/DPIBC) C&I
   Career Field Team (CICFT) serves as the ―front-line‖ in executing force development
   policies. Supporting the C&I community leadership, they manage the DT covering Civilian
   Development Education (CDE), Squadron Director Program, Outplacement and Vectoring.
   The CICFT provides career enhancing opportunities by managing the career broadening
   program by working with selecting officials to identity, establish and fill C&I positions
   across the Air Force. This team also develops future leaders through the Palace Acquire
   Internship Program and provides educational opportunities via the annual Tuition Assistance
   Program (TAP). The CICFT also administers SAF/A6O guidance with respect to centrally
   managed C&I positions. This includes providing determinations on external hiring,
   management reassignments, overseas extensions and relocation bonuses. The CICFT
   Roadshows communicate current workforce status and way ahead for career planning
   activities. The CICFT completes record reviews for career counseling and many other
   inquiries to serve the members of the C&I career program.
5.2. Position Coverage. The CICFT is responsible implementing the policies and guidance for
all C&I centrally managed positions. Centrally Managed positions are typically supervisory and
managerial positions. In general, centrally managed positions are defined at the GS-12
(Supervisory) and all higher grade levels. There are cases where GS-9 or 11 nonsupervisory are
categorized as centrally managed. It‘s recommended that the CICFT be contacted for
verification.
5.3. Career Mobility. In addition to the mobility requirements identified in Chapter 1,
paragraph 1.9, select GS-14‘s and all GS-15 positions designated by the C&I Civilian Advisory
Panel (CAP) will require mobility. Acceptance to internships, career broadening, and LTT
programs will require a mobility agreement.
5.4. Staffing Positions:
   5.4.1. External Candidates. For external recruitment of centrally managed positions an
   organization must have prior approval before submitting the request for personnel action
   (RPA). Exceptions to pre-authorization are limited to positions in a joint command, hardto-
   fill, or highcostof-living areas where Air Force is the executive agent.
   5.4.2. Management Reassignments. The organization must submit a request for
   management reassignments for all centrally managed positions. The request must be
   submitted in writing to the CICFT for approval prior to submitting the RPA. The request
   must include the name of the employee, the position, and the rationale for the movement.

   5.4.3. Interview Panels: For centrally managed positions selecting officials will conduct
   interviews by panel. A panel should consist of no less than three individuals. All panel
   members must be at least one grade higher than the interviewee. To the greatest extent
   possible representation should provide a balance in gender and race.
   5.4.4. By-Name Requests (BNR). The organization must submit a request for BNR for all
   centrally managed positions. The request must be submitted in writing to the CICFT for
   approval prior to submitting the RPA. The request must include the name of the employee,
   the position, and the rationale.
   5.4.5. Restructuring Positions. Approval to restructure a centrally managed position
   requires CICFT concurrence. Restructuring a centrally managed to noncentrally managed
   requires submission of the position description to AFMA classification. Restructuring a
   centrally managed position to non-centrally managed removes eligibility for CICFT managed
   programs and career program PCS funding.
   5.4.6. Permanent Change of Station (PCS). PCS costs will be paid for all centrally
   managed positions (subject to availability of funds). PCS statements must be included on all
   job announcements when applicable.
   5.4.7. Relocation Bonus. A relocation bonus can be used for competitive fill actions,
   management reassignments, and non-competitive promotions that are determined hardtofill
   and highcostof-living areas for centrally managed positions (subject to available funds).
   Organizations must obtain CICFT approval prior to submitting the RPA. Relocation bonus
   statements must be included on all job announcements when applicable.
5.5. Training & Development:
   5.5.1. Determining Course Offerings. The CICFT will propose and coordinate the course
   offerings as determined by C&I Force Development objectives and policies.
   5.5.2. Selection Criteria. The selection of all training is based on Development Team (DT)
   policies, recommendations, career field experience and any specific training requirements.
   5.5.3. On-site Courses. The CICFT schedules courses in areas of high concentration of
   interest and need. These courses are generally hosted at Air Force installations or
   metropolitan areas where the concentration of C&I personnel is high.
   5.5.4. Tuition Assistance (TA). CICFT will offer tuition assistance to eligible centrally
   managed personnel who may apply for part-time undergraduate (Bachelor) or part-time
   graduate (Master) studies. TA does not fund the cost of registration, books or fees.
   Personnel should contact the CICFT Tuition Assistance Administrator for additional
   information.
   5.5.5. Acquisition Certification Requirements. The Air Force, through Defense
   Acquisition University (DAU), provides the training required for you to meet mandatory
   position certification requirements and to advance in an acquisition specialty. Acquisition
   certification requirements are published in the Defense Acquisition University Course
   Catalog.
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                   59



5.6. Career Broadening (CB) Program. Refer to Chapter 1 for general information on the
AF career broadening program. Career broadening opportunities beginning at the GS-12 level.
The assignments are normally no more than 30 months in length providing broadening
experience in a varied set of opportunities (AF, joint, Career Program, etc.).
   5.6.1. The CICFT will accept applications, annually, for career broadening positions. The
   C&I DT will determine the eligibility of the applicants for CB opportunities. The CICFT
   Development Team (DT) will facilitate interviews and selections with the designated
   organization.
5.7. Palace Acquire Intern (PAQ) Program. The CICFT is responsible for the recruitment,
development, and training of all C&I PAQ interns. The Palace Acquire Intern Program is
governed by AFI 36-602. Personnel should contact the CICFT PAQ Administrator for program
specifics.

       CONTRACTING CAREER FIELD MANAGEMENT PROGRAM (CCFMP)

6.1. DEVELOPMENT TEAM STRUCTURE. The Contracting Development Team (DT)
includes oversight of the civilian and military contracting and contracting-supporting workforce.
This team is chartered to develop our workforce to meet deliberate Air Force requirements. The
joint oversight of the workforce includes ensuring that quality individuals are being identified
and encouraged to make careers in the Air Force, ensuring the workforce is being developed in a
manner to produce effective leaders through planned development activities, and ensuring career
paths are clear and compatible with opportunities and with the needs of the Air Force. The DT
also addresses career management initiatives and issues impacting the entire contracting career
field. The DT is chaired by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition, SAF/AQC, Senior
Executive Service members, the Contracting Career Field Manager, and senior military leaders
from across the Air Force. Two permanent DTs are established.
   6.1.1. Senior Level: The DT vectors GS-14/15 and equivalent employees. This team also
   assesses candidates for Senior Developmental Education programs.
   6.1.2. Intermediate Level: The DT vectors GS-12/13 and equivalent employees. This team
   also assesses candidates for Intermediate Developmental Education.
6.2. CENTRALLY MANAGED POSITIONS. The CCFMP centrally manages positions in
both primary occupational series and shared occupational series. Primary series positions are
those performing contracting, contractor industrial relations, or industrial property management
duties. Shared series positions are those performing duties at least 50% of the time in direct
support of contracting (at least 50% of the position‘s duties/skill codes must be contracting
duties).
   6.2.1. Primary Series Positions. These are positions in occupational series 1102, and 1103
   (see Figure 6.1). All grade 12 through 15 positions (or equivalent payband) in these series
   are centrally managed.
   6.2.2. Shared Series Positions. These are positions in occupational series 0301 and 1101
   (see Figure 6.1). In determining whether a position in one of these OCSRS is centrally
   managed, local supervisors and CPS staffs must consider: position title, pay plan, OCSRS,
   grade, functional account code (FAC), skills codes, and duties. The CCFMP will centrally
   manage all grade 12 through 15 (and equivalent) positions in these shared occupational
   series when the skills coding on the position reflects that the incumbent performs duties in
   direct support of contracting at least 50% of the time.
   6.2.3. Restructuring Positions: Contact the CCFT at AFPC for guidance regarding the
   appropriate approval authority for restructuring positions.
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                         61

6.3. MANAGEMENT INITIATED ASSIGNMENTS. A CCFMP position may be filled by
management-initiated/directed reassignment or management-approved voluntary change to lower
grade without prior approval from the CCFMP chief when the proposed action meets the
following criteria.
   6.3.1. The candidate is currently occupying or has occupied a centrally managed position.
   6.3.2. The candidate meets all qualification and other requirements of the position.
   6.3.3. There will be no CFMP-funded PCS or relocation services associated with the
   assignment.
6.4. TRAINING & DEVELOPMENT.
   6.4.1. Acquisition Professional Development Program (APDP). All positions in the 1102
   and 1103 series must be APDP coded. See Chapter 1, Section G for specific DAWIA
   requirements. The APDP functional manager for these requirements is SAF/AQC with the
   point of contact in SAF/AQCX.
   6.4.2. Career Broadening (CB) Program. Career broadeners are generally selected from
   the pool of individuals vectored by the Contracting Development Team (DT) for a career
   broadening or cross-functional career broadening opportunity. Career Broadeners may also
   be selected from a job announcement. As CB vacancies occur, vectored individuals or those
   that self nominate are generally interviewed by a DT panel. Specific career broadening
   assignments are developed based upon the individual career broadener development need as
   well as needs of the Air Force.
 62                                                              AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011


   6.4.3. Tuition Assistance (for Non-Acquisition coded positions). The CCFMP Tuition
   Assistance program policies and procedures are posted on the CCFMP website. Significant
   points are that the CCFMP may fund coursework that is lower than the employee‘s highest
   level of post secondary achievement if the coursework is being taken to meet statutory
   requirements to qualify for lateral or upward movement in the 1102 occupational series. The
   CCFMP will not fund coursework that is creditable toward a second master‘s degree or a
   doctorate‘s degree unless that coursework is being taken for the reason stated immediately
   above.
   6.4.4. Long Term Training (LTT). The CCFMP will support LTT opportunities offered
   under the Civilian Career Development Program, the Defense Senior Leadership
   Development Program (DSLDP), and other programs deemed appropriate by the Contracting
   Development Team. Employees participating in these programs will not be referred for
   reassignment or change-to-lower grade consideration until the first of the month in which the
   program ends. A participant selected for a centrally managed position during the program
   period may report for duty only after completion of the program.
   6.4.5. Other Training Opportunities. The CCFMP will also participate in short-term
   training and development programs such as the OPM Management Development Center
   courses.
6.5. EXTERNAL FILLS. Selecting officials who request external announcements must also
announce internally.
6.6. WHOLE PERSON SCORES. The use of the Whole Person Score (WPS), also known as
Quality Ranking Criteria, is not utilized by the Contracting Career field for referral purposes.
6.7. CONTRACTING          CAREER       PATH       AND    CAREER        DEVELOPMENT
ROADMAPS. Contracting career field developmental information is located in the Career
Development Tools section of the Force/Career Development Folder, Contracting Career Field

7.3. DEVELOPMENT TEAM (DT). The DT continuously assesses, develops and implements
a comprehensive plan for achieving IACF mission-driven force development requirements.
   7.3.1. Development Team Membership:
       7.3.1.1. SAF/IA

       7.3.1.5. AFMC Logistics and Product Centers
       7.3.1.6. AMC-International Relations Advisor
7.4. TRAINING AND EDUCATION PANEL (TEP). The TEP develops and recommends
IACF training and education policies and/or changes to the IACF DT.
7.5. CENTRALLY MANAGED POSITIONS. Through central management of core positions
within the IACF, the DT and senior IA leaders deliberately develop team members for positions
of increased responsibilities in the career field. In turn, these positions afford IACF team
members focused education and training and provide assignment experiences that are supported
by mentoring at all levels from seasoned IA professionals. The DT defines Centrally Managed
positions as operational and strategic level positions (GS-13 through GS-15 grade level).
Centrally Managed positions also include: Career Broadening and Palace Acquire Intern
positions. Each of these positions will provide developmental work experiences intended to
prepare IA team members for higher-level supervisory and managerial positions. IACF team
members in Centrally Managed positions are entitled to centrally funded moves (PCS) and other
development opportunities to include short-term management and leadership training, Civilian
Developmental Education (CDE), and tuition assistance.
7.6. MANAGEMENT INITIATED ASSIGNMENTS (MIA). A MIA may be accomplished
by assigning an employee to a vacant position or by swapping two employees between positions.
There are two types of MIAs: assignments within the IA functional community, and
assignments from outside the IACF. All MIAs into a Centrally Managed position must be routed
through the Career Field Team (CFT) and approved by the Career Field Manager and DT.
7.7. CAREER BROADENING PROGRAM. The IACF Career Broadening Program
leverages the Headquarters, Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) Career Broadening program that
is available to all career fields. This program is designed to broaden the skills and enhance
leadership perspective of high-potential and exceptional personnel. Annually, the IACF DT will
review and recommend AF candidates that have been vectored for career broadening
assignments in compliance with AFPC DT Meeting Cycle responsibilities. Assignments are
scheduled for 36 months and require a mobility agreement and training and development plan.
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                          65



7.8. TRAINING & DEVELOPMENT. (Refer to Chapter 1 Section F)
   7.8.1. International Affairs Certification Program (IACP). Quality training and
   continual learning play an extremely important role in the AF‘s ability to accomplish its
   mission. Therefore, it is essential that senior leaders are involved in planning, developing,
   managing, conducting, and evaluating an effective and efficient training program. IACF will
   leverage the Department of Defense (DoD) IACP to assess IA experience and training for
   IACF team members. IACP has three levels of certification designed to build on previous
   levels. Each certification level identifies specific requirements that must be met in order to
   be certified: Level I – Basic or Foundation Level, Level II – Intermediate Level, and Level
   III – Advanced or Expert Level.
   7.8.2. Global Master of Arts Program (GMAP II). The GMAP II is a Defense Security
   Cooperation Agency (DSCA) sponsored 12-month program that culminates in a Master of
   Arts degree from The Fletcher School at Tufts University. The program combines three two-
   week residency sessions with state-of-the-art internet-based courses of study. The program is
   presented in trimester form with three courses presented the first and second trimesters, and
   two courses plus a thesis in the third trimester. PCS travel will not be required. Students will
   continue to work from their home stations/countries. Two mandatory two-week in-resident
   sessions will be conducted at The Fletcher School outside Boston, Massachusetts and one
   mandatory two-week in-resident session will be conducted at an international location
   selected by Tufts University. The program is part time and takes on average 20 hours per
   week of study in addition to the student‘s regular workload. Students whose native tongue is
   English are required to pass oral and reading language exams in a foreign language of their
   choice. The IACF DT will select two primary and one alternate AF nominees annually to
   compete for a DoD GMAP II quota. Detailed information about GMAP II can be found on
   the            IA             Workforce             Initiatives            website           at:
   http://www.safia.hq.af.mil/workforceinitiatives/gmapoverview.asp.
   7.8.3. IA Workforce Initiatives website. The IA workforce initiates website located at
   http://www.safia.hq.af.mil/workforceinitiatives/, provides the most recent information on
   career development opportunities, graduate studies, IA Certification, and IACF.
7.9. DEVELOPMENT PLANNING. The vision of Civilian Force Development is to create a
civilian workforce that is responsive to requirements and can be managed as an integral part of
the Total Force, including mobility, where it serves the AF and the IA mission. Through robust
career field management, integrated leadership education, and clearly defined requirements,
IACF will integrate the development of IA civilians with their military counterparts. IACF team
members should reference the Career Path pyramid (Figure 7.9.1) and development templates
(Figures 7.10.1.1, 7.10.2.1, and 7.10.3.1) along with supervisor and/or mentor guidance to create
a planned approach for personal development.
 66                                                              AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011


Figure 7.2. Career Path Pyramid.




7.10. DEVELOPMENT TEMPLATES. Three levels of career development are described in
this section. Each development level identifies competencies the AF requires civilians to
develop and exercise throughout their career. Development templates should be used to guide
discussions between IA team members and their supervisors/managers as career paths and plans
are developed.
   7.10.1. Tactical Development Level. At the tactical level, IA civilian members master their
   primary duties, skills and responsibilities, and gain a general understanding of team
   leadership and an appreciation for institutional leadership. Assignments should establish and
   build depth of knowledge and technical expertise within IA. This level includes gaining
   knowledge and experience in a primary skill, combined with educational and leadership
   training exercises.
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                    67


Figure 7.3. Tactical Development Level Template.




   7.10.2. Operational Development Level. At the operational level, IA civilian members
   transition from a specialist to an individual who understands AF integration. This level
   includes continued broadening of experience and increased responsibility within a related
   family of skills. Team members in operational level positions continue to develop personal
   leadership skills, while developing familiarity in institutional leadership competencies.
   During this time, Career Broadening and cross-functional assignment experience
   opportunities should be considered to increase potential for career progression.

Figure 7.4. Operational Development Level Template.




   7.10.3. Strategic Development Level. At the strategic level, IA civilian members combine
   highly developed occupational and enduring competencies to apply broad professional
   leadership capabilities.    Strategic positions require individuals to develop a deep
   understanding of AF missions and how operational capabilities and resources are integrated
   to achieve synergistic results and desired effects. Individuals will also develop a greater
   understanding of how the AF operates within joint, interagency, and multinational
   relationships. At this level, an individual‘s required competencies transition from the
   integration of people with missions to leading and directing exceptionally complex and
   multi-tiered organizations.

   8.2.3. DT Sub-Panels: The Development Team Chairs will appoint DT Sub-Panels to assist
   the Team in designing, implementing, and maintaining the program.
8.3. CENTRALLY MANAGED POSITIONS. The FMCFMP will centrally manage the
positions described below. The DT may elect to change the scope of the program operations.
   8.3.1. Primary Series. The FMCF will centrally manage all two-grade interval GS-12
   through GS-15 and equivalent positions in series 5XX, i.e., GS-501, 505, 510, and 560.
   8.3.2. Shared Series. Normally, the FMCF will centrally manage the following GS-12
   through GS-15 and equivalent positions when established in FAC 15XX (except 154X) or
   when they meet the criteria established in the note below.
       8.3.2.1. GS-301, Resource Analyst/Manager/Program Control/ etc.
       8.3.2.2. GS-343, Program Analyst/Management Analyst
       8.3.2.3. GS-1515, Operations Research Analyst
NOTE: Positions in the above series located outside of FAC 15XX will also be designated as
FMCF centrally managed positions if their primary purpose is financial in nature; i.e., positions
which require incumbents to possess the KSAs normally obtained through experience and/or
education associated with financial management positions. The servicing Civilian Personnel
Element (CPS) should consult with the Career Field Team (CFT) if there are questions
concerning whether such positions are included in the scope of program operations.
8.4. CAREER MOBILITY. Career mobility will include rotational assignments or geographic
relocation. Interns, career broadeners, and employees selected for long-term training will sign
agreements which may require geographical mobility to follow-on positions. Except as
described above and as provided in AFI 36-202 for GS-14 and 15 positions and equivalent,
geographic mobility will be a voluntary feature of the FMCFMP. Career broadening and certain
other FMCF positions will require a follow-on Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) or mobility
agreement as a condition of employment. The CFT will obtain signatures from the selected
candidate and all approval authorities before final selection and assignment. The servicing CPS
will file the agreement in the employee‘s OPF. A sample agreement is at Attachment 3.
8.5. EXEMPTION           FROM        STANDARD         CAREER          FIELD        REFERRAL
PROCEDURES. Standard career field recruitment for centrally managed positions will
include all Air Force internal candidates. Simultaneous internal and external recruitment
is allowed without prior approval from the CFT. If standard referral procedures do not
produce a viable candidate, the supervisor may request an exception to fill the position through
alternative recruitment procedures.. On an exception basis and with strong justification, the DT
Co-Chair or designee may authorize a one-time approval for the organization to fill the position
through the servicing CPS or the Delegated Examining Office (DEO). When this occurs, the CPS
or DEO must use the ranking template or assessment created and approved by the FM Functional
Manager.
 72                                                              AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011


8.6. MANAGEMENT INITIATED REASSIGNMENTS. Provisions of AFMAN 36-203,
Staffing Civilian Positions, apply. Prior approval from the DT Chair must be obtained for any
management reassignment that involves a geographic move (PCS) or is between MAJCOMs.
For reassignments involving either of the above actions, gaining supervisors will send requests
through their servicing CPS to the CFT for approval before taking any action. The written
request will provide the name, organization, and phone numbers of the reassignment candidate,
gaining supervisor, and losing supervisor. The request must also contain justification and a
statement which verifies contact has been made with the losing supervisor/CPS and that all
parties are in agreement with the requested reassignment.
8.7. TRAINING & DEVELOPMENT.
   8.7.1. Formal Training. The FMCF will centrally fund courses to satisfy intern,
   managerial, and executive development needs. (Local managers will fund and administer
   other types of training.) Information and application process for sponsored courses are listed
   in the Training and Development Course Listing on the AFPC website.
       8.7.1.1. Civilian Developmental Education (CDE). Individuals in centrally managed
       positions can apply for Professional Military Education (PME) or Long-Term Training.
       More information on CDE can be found at the AFPC website. (Some PME classes are
       offered through correspondence or seminar without having to go TDY. Please see your
       local base education office for these opportunities.)
       8.7.1.2. Professional Financial Management Training. The FMCF is allocated several
       civilian training quotas for each Financial Management Staff Officer Course (FMSOC)
       for interns; all other employees should contact their Major Command FM Training Office
       for training quotas.
   8.7.2. Career Broadening. The FMCF may establish approved career broadening positions
   within the Air Force to meet corporate developmental needs. Individuals will normally serve
   for a period of 24-30 months on a career broadening position. Their follow-on assignment
   will be to a predetermined permanent position or as indicated in a MOA. Individuals selected
   for a FMCF career broadening position must sign a MOA before being officially selected and
   assigned. All selections for a FMCF career broadening position will require advance
   approval and signature on the MOA by the DT Co-Chair.
       8.7.2.1. Placement of Career Broadening Positions. The DT will determine where Career
       Broadening positions are to be placed
       8.7.2.2. Filling Career Broadening Positions. The organization receiving a position will
       submit a proposed position description, organizational chart, functional statement, and
       training plan to the CFT. Career broadening positions are filled through management
       reassignment, change to lower grade, and/or temporary promotion using competitive
       procedures.
   8.7.3. PALACE Acquire (PAQ) Training Program: The FMCF administers a formal,
   structured 3-year intern training program using the Office of Personnel Management‘s
   (OPM) Administrative Careers With America (ACWA), Federal Career Intern Program
   (FCIP) special hiring authorities or conversion of current Air Force Student Career
   Experience Program (SCEP) employees under OPM‘s Schedule B authority, 5 CFR
   213.3202 (b).
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                            73


       8.7.3.1. For the Administrative Careers With America (ACWA) and Federal Career
       Intern Program (FCIP) hiring authorities, qualifications are based on experience,
       education or a combination of education and experience. (NOTE: Disabled students may
       call the Force Renewal Branch for guidelines.)
       8.7.3.2. Interns receive extensive on-the-job training and attend professional military
       education (PME) courses to enable them to function effectively in financial management
       positions. MAJCOM/FMs identify potential host sites during an annual call. Additional
       information on the PALACE Acquire program can be found in AFMAN 36-602, Civilian
       Intern Programs.
   8.7.4. Tuition Assistance (TA). The Civilian Tuition Assistance Program (CTAP) is an Air
   Force force development initiative priority designed to benefit the Air Force mission by
   providing assistance for mission related courses at accredited colleges and universities taken
   during non-duty hours. All requests for tuition assistance must be received by the CFT at
   least 30 days prior to the start date of the class to allow time for review, approval, and
   funding of the request.
       8.7.4.1. Except for shortage occupations, public law prohibits training of civilians for the
       sole purpose of acquiring an academic degree. However, a degree may be an incidental
       by-product of CTAP. Accordingly, CTAP is restricted to academic mission-related
       courses as certified by the FMCF. While each course must be validated as mission-
       related, the CTAP differs from training in that employees, rather than management,
       identify requirements, initiate requests for specific courses at institutions of their choice,
       share in the cost, and attend on a voluntary off-duty basis.
       8.7.4.2. Under CTAP guidance, the FMCF must use the standard rate of 75% of tuition
       costs, not to exceed $187.50 per semester hour or $124.50 per quarter hour, and is limited
       to $3500 per fiscal year. TA for acquisition personnel under the Defense Acquisition
       Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) is mandated by DoD policy and is not subject to
       these CTAP funding limits. PALACE ACQUIRE interns are covered under AFI 36-602,
       Civilian Intern Programs, and also are not subject to these CTAP funding limits.
       8.7.4.3. The CTAP guidance applies across the Air Force and to all sources of money.
       This includes tuition assistance paid by career field programs, installation-level training
       offices, organizational funds, or outside agencies, which may not make up the difference
       between the CTAP cap and tuition costs for employees. Tuition assistance will not be
       provided for non-instructional costs such as books, materials, examination fees, optional
       fees, parking, charges for personal services, or the costs of vicinity travel.
8.8. CAREER       PATHS. See           the      FM      Force      Development        Primer       at
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/FMET.
8.9. STAFFING POSITIONS. The CFT and DT designated functional area Sub Panel will
jointly develop standard internal promotion plans for use in filling all FM centrally managed
positions.
   8.9.1. Development Team (DT). The DT will be briefed on all new and revised promotion
   plans.
74                                                                AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011


  8.9.2. Management Officials. Management officials may request modification of
  promotion plans through their MAJCOM to the CFT for new positions or revisions to current
  positions. Requests must include the proposed change, rationale, and supporting job analysis
  data.
8.10. CLASSIFICATION          ACTIONS        AFFECTING          CENTRALLY            MANAGED
POSITIONS.
  8.10.1. Upgrading to GS-13 and equivalent.
     8.10.1.1. If the position is vacant, the CPS may upgrade a centrally managed position up
     to grade GS-13 or equivalent without the prior coordination and approval of the DT Chair
     or designee. The CPS must only notify the CFT of the upgrade.
     8.10.1.2. If the position is filled and the upgrading action is due to classification error or
     application of a new or revised standard or is clearly a successor position where there are
     no other employees in similar or identical positions to whom the supervisor could assign
     the work, the CPS may non-competitively promote the incumbent without prior
     coordination or approval from the DT Chair. However, the CPS is to provide written
     notification to the CFT for information and reporting purposes.
  8.10.2. Upgrading to GS-14 and equivalent. Any upgrade of a centrally managed position
  to the GS-14 or equivalent grade level will require prior approval of the DT Chair before the
  CPS may effect the upgrade. Management will submit all requests for upgrade approval
  through base and MAJCOM functional channels to the CFT. The CPS will coordinate on the
  request, which will address the following questions:
  Will this upgrade result in the potential upgrade of any other positions?
  Is the position encumbered?
  If encumbered, does the upgrade meet the noncompetitive promotion criteria described in
  8.10.1.2 above? If not, will a limited area of competition be requested for the fill action?
  8.10.3. Classification of GS-15 and equivalent positions. Prior to any personnel action,
  the CFT and DT Chair or designee will review all proposed personnel actions that would
  change the position structure, grade, or qualifications of any existing centrally managed
  position or that propose to create a new GS-15 or equivalent position. The servicing CPS will
  prepare and forward a review package through the MAJCOM A1C and FM, who will submit
  a coordinated package to the CFT. The package must include:
     8.10.3.1. Pertinent position classification information to include: reason for changes to
     the position, position description, evaluation statement, organization chart, position
     descriptions of key subordinate positions, etc.
     8.10.3.2. Pertinent information concerning any incumbent in the position to include:
     copy of current position description, statement as to whether or not there are other
     positions in the organization to which the supervisor could assign the GS-15 duties, and
     recommendation on whether the fill action should be competitive.
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                     75


8.11. FILLING RESTRUCTURED POSITIONS. See Chapter 1.
8.12. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT APDP REQUIREMENTS. In order to be selected for
a Critical Acquisition Position (CAP), candidates must be an Acquisition Corps member prior to
assignment to the position unless a waiver is requested and approved. See Chapter 1 for
Acquisition Corps membership requirements. For non-critical acquisition positions, candidates
must meet the APDP certification requirements for the position prior to appointment or be able
to meet the requirements within 24 months of the appointment. If unable to meet the
requirements within 24 months, a waiver must be requested and approved. Acquisition
certification requirements are published in the Defense Acquisition University (DAU) Course
Catalog.

         LOGISTICS CAREER FIELD MANAGEMENT PROGRAM (LCFMP)

10.1. LOGISTICS EXECUTIVE BOARD. The Logistics Executive Board (LEB) provides
strategic oversight, direction and information to the Logistics Advisory Council and Logistics
Career Program Functional members. The LEB focuses on providing consistent strategic
guidance and information regarding the development and management of a competency-based
logistics workforce to satisfy current and future Air Force mission needs. This will be
accomplished through strategic goal-setting in the strategic and operations force development
arenas. As a standing body and regularly scheduled forum, the LEB will facilitate
communication among all logistics areas, provide guidance on all logistics matters, and help plan
for future logistics force development.
   10.1.1. LEB MEMBERSHIP: The Board will be co-chaired by the senior civilian
   Logisticians in the Air Force, normally the Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff/Logistics,
   Installations & Mission Support and the AFMC/Executive Director. The LEB is responsible
   for developing a charter, which will further define the members and advisors, as well as roles
   and responsibilities.
10.2. LOGISTICS ADVISORY COUNCIL. The Logistics Advisory Council (LAC) provides
guidance and direction to the various panels, sub panels and working groups which make up the
Logistics Career Field Team (LCFT). The LAC focuses on providing consistent logistics
management through the establishment of two panels: Workforce Management Panel (WMP)
and Workforce Development Panel (WDP).
   10.2.1. LAC MEMBERSHIP: The Council will be co-chaired by the Functional
   Manager/Managers for Logistics civilian career specialties and designated representative as
   identified by the Functional Manager. The LAC is responsible for developing a charter,
   which will further define the members and advisors, as well as roles and responsibilities.
10.3. PANELS. The following panels have been established to provide oversight of the
Logistics Career Field and the Logistics Career Field Team (LCFT) and its day-to-day
operations. The panels work to design, implement and maintain procedures for the program.
The Advisory Council Co-Chairs select the chairs of the panels.
   10.3.1. The Workforce Management Panel (WMP) establishes criteria for position
   coverage by the Logistics Career Field. Through continuing surveillance of program trends,
   manpower authorization changes, and long-term executive needs, the Panel develops
   recommendations for Advisory Council consideration. The Panel provides position studies,
   developed for council consideration to other Logistics activities and to functional
   management to ensure a coordinated approach to management of Logistics covered positions.
   The Panel provides oversight of the development of promotion plans by working groups
   comprised of subject matter experts who develop these promotion plans for positions in their
   areas of occupational expertise. These promotion plans are for use in providing competitive
   referral certificates for filling centrally managed positions. The panel also develops and
   administers the Whole Person Score (WPS) process applied to the centrally managed
   positions. The Panel provides oversight of the elements of the WPS. This Panel develops
 80                                                              AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011


   and executes the WPS implementation plan. The Panel also oversees the Logistics PALACE
   Acquire (PAQ) intern program, AFI 36-602.
   10.3.2. The Workforce Development Panel (WDP) reviews training requirements,
   develops training criteria, and provides general guidance for administering Logistics career
   field training and developmental programs. The WDP works in concert with the
   Development Team (DT) to develop, evaluate, and implement strategies to integrate Air
   Force developmental programs that cut across Logistics career field programs, initiatives,
   and activities. The panel articulates logistics workforce development strategies and
   requirements at the Air Force level.
10.4. CENTRALLY MANAGED POSITIONS. Logistics career field centrally manages
positions which the Advisory Council approves for program inclusion. The Logistics career field
covers all GS-13 through GS-15 (and equivalent) positions in the series shown in Figure 10.1.
Each MAJCOM commander or equivalent may determine up to 50 percent of Logistics positions
for coverage by grade for GS-09 to GS-11 and equivalent positions for Transportation series and
GS-12 and equivalent positions for all other series. MAJCOM logistics functional managers will
inform the LCFT of percentages chosen and of any changes. The percentage will apply to all
bases and activities within the Command or equivalent organization.
10.5. CAREER MOBILITY. See Chapter 1, paragraph 1.9.
10.6. STAFFING POSITIONS. See Chapter 1 for procedures for submitting requests for
competitive referral certificates.
   10.6.1. Centrally managed positions filled and the Whole Person Score (WPS). The LCFT
   applies a WPS to rank employees who self-nominate for Air Force-wide promotion,
   reassignment, change-to-lower-grade (CLG), and developmental opportunities. The WPS
   provides a numerical point assessment of a self-nominee‘s overall qualifications against
   defined and stated career field individual, developmental objectives.
       10.6.1.1. The WPS awards points for a combination of elements: experience, education,
       and performance appraisal. The applicability of elements depends on the grade of the
       position for which a competitive referral certificate has been requested. Figure 10.1
       reflects the WPS elements and maximum awardable points. Attachment 4 provides
       details on scoring procedures.
   10.6.2. Promotion Plans. The LCFT and WMP along with established occupational series
   functional work groups, develop standard Air Force-wide promotion plans for use in
   providing competitive referral certificates for filling Logistics centrally managed positions.
       10.6.2.1. The functional work groups represent all occupational series centrally managed
       by the career program and develop promotion plans for their specific functional areas of
       expertise.
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                        81


   10.6.3. Ranking Candidates. Self-nominating candidate‘s skills-coded experience records
   pass through each of four areas of the promotion plan: Basic Eligibility skills, Fallback,
   Primary Lead-In skills and the Primary skills of the position for which a certificate has been
   requested. As an experience record passes each of these four areas, points are awarded
   toward an overall score for each self-nominating employee. In addition, the plan awards
   WPS points and points for possession of acquisition certification, where this is a requirement
   of the position being filled. A total score, including WPS and acquisition certification where
   appropriate, is determined. Each candidate record is then ranked by the total points awarded.
      10.6.3.1. When a Centrally managed position request for fill occurs, each candidate
      record is awarded additional points based upon experience credited by the promotion plan
      beyond the Fallback skills area. A maximum of 80 additional points may be awarded in
      this process. The actual number of points is determined by the number of experience
      elements possessed by a candidate.
   10.6.4. Upgrading Logistics Centrally Managed Positions:        See Chapter 1, paragraph
   1.20.4.
   10.6.5. Filling Developmental Positions. See Chapter 1, paragraph 1.8.
   10.6.6. Temporary Fill Actions. See Chapter 1, paragraph 1.20.3.
10.7. MANAGEMENT INITIATED ASSIGNMENTS.
   10.7.1. Assignments Involving a PCS. The Logistics Functional Manager must approve
   these assignments in advance. The requesting official will send a written request to the
   LCFT, through the CPS and provide position CPCN, series, grade, title, office symbol, and
   candidate's name and SSN and justifying reasons for the reassignment The LCFT will
   confirm qualifications; determine satisfactory appraisal; confirm awareness of losing and
   gaining functional managers/supervisors; and obtain Functional Manager approval.
   10.7.2. Assignments Not Involving a PCS. The supervisor will notify the LCFT in writing
   before the action, providing all information required in paragraph 10.6.1 above. Functional
   Manager approval is not required. In the event a Management Initiated Reassignment is
   requested for an individual who does not meet minimum requirements as identified in the
   appropriate series template, a waiver request will be forwarded to the LCFT for review and
   approval by the Functional Manager.
10.8. TRAINING & DEVELOPMENT. The LCFT will provide central funding and

reassigned from one centrally managed position to another, not of a higher grade, provided that
the employee meets minimum qualifications. Assignment cannot be to a position with known
growth potential. The requesting official will submit a request to the PA CFT chief, who will
confirm employee eligibility, ensure appropriate coordination between gaining and losing
organizations and MAJCOMs, and process a fund cite request, if required. The PA civilian CFM
is the approval authority for assignments at GS-13 or above; the PA CFT chief is the approval
authority for positions at GS-12 and below.

bonus statements must be included on all job announcements when applicable. Approval will
follow AFPC guidelines. Only internal candidates are eligible to receive a relocation bonus.
12.8. CAREER MOBILITY. Career mobility includes local rotational assignments and
geographic relocation. PALACE Acquire interns and PACFMP participants occupying specific
career-broadening or career-enhancing positions and those completing long-term training will
sign geographic mobility agreements. Career mobility is highly encouraged and considered
integral to civilian development and career progression.

      SAFETY CIVILIAN CAREER FIELD MANAGEMENT PROGRAM (SCCFMP)

13.1. FUNCTIONAL ADVISORY COUNCIL (FAC) STRUCTURE. The Safety Civilian
Career Management Program (SCCMP) Advisory Council structure provides oversight of the
safety civilian workforce. The advisory council ensures the safety civilian workforce is
developed in a manner to produce effective leaders through planned development activities, and
that career paths are clear and compatible with opportunities and Air Force requirements. The
Advisory Council addresses force development in addition to career field management initiatives
and issues impacting the safety career field. The FAC will be chaired by the Functional
Authority (AF/SE). The Functional Authority may delegate the FAC Chair responsibility to the
Functional Manager (AF/SED) as in accordance with AFI 36-2640, Executing Total Force
Development. The duties and responsibilities of the Functional Authority, Functional Manager,
Career Field Manager and AFPC Career Field Team are also contained in AFI 36-2640.
   13.1.1. The FAC will be comprised of the following voting members:
       13.1.1.1. The Functional Authority (FA) – AF/SE.
       13.1.1.2. Functional Manager (FM) – AF/SED.
       13.1.1.3. Civilian Career Field Manager (CFM) – AF/SEM.
       13.1.1.4. Enlisted Career Field Manager – AFSC/CDM.
       13.1.1.5. MAJCOM Civilian Career Field Managers.
   13.1.2. The FAC will also be comprised of the following nonvoting members:
       13.1.2.1. AFPC Safety Career Field Team (CFT) Chief or rep.
       13.1.2.2. Safety Program Assistant.
13.2. SAFETY DEVELOPMENT TEAM STRUCTURE. The Safety Development Team
(DT) will be chaired by the Safety Functional Manager (AF/SED) and includes oversight of the
centrally-managed civilian safety program. The DT addresses career management initiatives and
issues impacting the safety career field and provides recommended developmental vectors. The
Safety DT will consist of the FM (AF/SED) who also serves as the senior civilian in Safety, the
Career Field Manager (AFSC/SEM), MAJCOM Civilian CFMs, a representative from AF/SEI,
the Safety Enlisted Career Field Manager, the AFPC Safety CFT Chief, and other representatives
as determined by AF/SED.
13.3. EXECUTIVE PANELS. The DT Chair may appoint executive panels as necessary to
assist, design, implement, and maintain the program as needed.
13.4. CENTRALLY MANAGED POSITIONS. The SCCMP will centrally manage all AF
positions at grades GS-09 through 15 (and equivalent Pay Bands) in primary (or shared) Series
0017, Explosives Safety; 0018, Safety and Occupational Health Management; 0019, Safety
Technician; 0803, Safety Engineering; 1815, Air Safety Investigating, and specified 0301,
Miscellaneous Administrative and Program Series. The AF/SE, AF/SED, and/or the CFM may

AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                         93


13.5. CAREER MOBILITY. Personnel appointed to GS-15 and/or equivalent Pay Bands may
be required to execute a mobility agreement. Interns, career broadeners, and registrants in long-
term training will be required to execute a written mobility agreement which may require
geographic mobility to follow-on assignments. Except as provided in AFI 36-202, geographic
mobility is a voluntary feature of the Safety Career Field. Reference AFMAN 36-606, Air Force
Civilian Career Program Management, Chapter 1, Section 1B – Career Program Participation,
Paragraph 1.9.
13.6. "HARD-TO-FILL" LOCATIONS. The Safety CFT will work with the selecting official
to recommend additional recruitment options when a centrally managed position meets the
criteria for designation as ―hard-to-fill.‖ This may include, for example, using external
recruitment sources, issuing multiple grade/band-level referral certificates, or determining a
recruitment/relocation incentive to increase the applicant pool. The Relocation Incentive
Program is centrally funded and managed by the Director of Civilian Force Integration, and
administered by the CFT. Only internal AF candidates are eligible to receive a relocation
incentive. Approval for incentive(s) will follow AFPC guidelines.
13.7. EXTERNAL/INTERNAL RECRUITMENT. All requests for external recruitment must
include internal recruitment UNLESS the fill request is for a temporary and/or overhire position.
The use of competitive examining, such as Delegated Examining Office (DEO)Office of
Personnel management (OPM) or Alternate Certification actions must be approved by the Safety
CFM through the Safety CFT before submitting the RPA for fill. Prior to selecting a DEO
candidate, the selecting official must provide justification to the CFM through the CFT as to
how/why all internal/external candidates were not selected. External fills that do not include
DEO do not require CFM approval. Internal recruitment only is authorized.
   13.7.1. TEMPORARY/OVERHIRE                   POSITIONS. The         recruitment       for
   temporary/overhire positions does not require CFM approval. Temporary/overhire positions
   are not centrally-managed and PCS costs will not be authorized for these same positions.
   Non-appropriated fund (NAF) and term positions are considered external candidates for
   recruitment purposes. External recruitment only is authorized
   13.7.2. EXEMPTION            FROM        NORMAL          CAREER         FIELD      REFERRAL
   PROCEDURES. An Alternate Certification request requires pre-approval by the CFM
   through the CFT prior to submission of the RPA. This process will allow full consideration
   of the implications of force development/force management and/or DT vectoring. If normal
   referral recruitment procedures do not produce a viable candidate, a supervisor may request
   an exception to fill the position internally via an Alternate Certificate request.
13.8. MANAGEMENT              Initiated     Assignments. Management-initiated        actions    or
reassignments affecting centrally-managed positions that involve a geographic move (PCS) or is
between MAJCOMs must be approved by the CFT through the CFM. The CFM approves
reassignment or change to lower grade/pay band from a non-centrally-managed to a centrally-
managed position. The CFT will be notified of all management-initiated reassignments through
receipt of the Request for Personnel Action submitted through DCPDS. Prior to submission of
the RPA, the requesting official must submit a written request to the CFT. The request must
include the position, series, grade, title, office symbol, position description, candidate‘s name
and SSN. The CFT will obtain CFM approval, and assist with providing a fund cite, if
necessary. Provisions of AFMAN 36-203, Staffing Civilian Positions, apply.
 94                                                              AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011


13.9. CAREER PATH. The Safety Career Master Development Plan (SCMDP) reflects the
normal entry level, either through an intern program, or a locally administered hiring process.
Individuals advance through progressively complex assignments, which may include career
broadening assignments or rotational training assignments at the mid-management level. See
Figure 13.1, Master Development Plan and Figure 13.2, Safety Career Development Plan.
13.10. TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT. Factors considered for funded training are: time
in grade, education, past experience, mission relevance, previous SCCF funded course
completion and mission needs. The CFT centrally funds and administers select leadership,
management, executive and professional development programs. Additionally, the CFT will
ensure the FM, through the CFM, remains abreast of training and development opportunities,
selections, and funding. Reference AFMAN 36-306, Chapter 1, Section 1F – Training and
Development. See Figures 13.3 – 13.5, Tactical, Optional, and Strategic Development
Templates.
   13.10.1. Career Broadening (CB). The FM and/or the CFM will determine the location of
   safety Career Broadening (CB) positions and may place CB positions anywhere appropriate
   in the Air Force to meet corporate developmental needs. The CFM serves as selection
   official for applicants into the CB program. The FM serves as final approval authority
   through consultation with the FA, if necessary. Career broadening positions are normally
   filled through management reassignments and individuals will normally serve an AFPC-
   approved CB tour for a maximum of 30 months. Individuals selected for a safety CB
   assignment must sign a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) before AFPC
   selection/assignment actions are initiated. All selections will be finalized by the CFM or
   CFT Chief‘s signature on the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). The follow-on
   assignment will be a pre-determined permanent position or as indicated in the MOA. The
   length of assignment will be for a period not to exceed 30 months, beginning with the official
   date assigned to the career broadening position. The CFT will actively monitor all vacancies
   6-months prior to the end of the CB tour. The CFT develops and ensures the accuracy of the
   CB Development Plan. The development plan is approved by the FA or the designee. The
   CFM ensures the development plan is documented through periodic follow-up with the
   supervisor of the Career Broadener. Reference AFMAN 36-606, Chapter 1, Section 1F –
   Training and Development, Paragraph 1.38.
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                         95


  13.10.2. PALACE Acquire (PAQ) Intern Program. The Safety CFT is responsible for the
  recruitment, development, and training of all SCCF PAQ interns.            AFPC/DPIF is the
  program management office for Force Renewal and the PAQ Intern Management program.
  The CFM serves as the selection official for applicants into the PAQ program. The FM
  serves as final approval authority through consultation with the FA, if necessary. The CFM
  approves placement of all interns upon entry and graduation from the program. The CFT will
  actively monitor all vacancies 6-months prior to the end of the PAQ assignment to ensure an
  outplacement location upon graduation from the program. MAJCOMs requesting an intern
  have a responsibility to place the intern at the end of the 2-year program. However, the CFT
  will assist with placement efforts should the MAJCOM not have a vacancy. The CFT
  develops and ensures the accuracy of the PAQ Intern Development Plan. The development
  plan is approved by the FA or the designee. The CFM ensures the development plan is
  documented through periodic follow-up with the supervisor of the PAQ. The PALACE
  Acquire Intern Program is governed by Air Force Instruction 36-602, Civilian Intern
  Programs.
  13.10.3. Civilian Development Education (CDE). Individuals may apply for Professional
  Military Education (PME) or long-term training. PME classes, e.g., Squadron Officer
  College and Air Command and Staff College are offered through correspondence, in-
  residence or seminar. Applicants must understand completion of CDE may include a follow-
  on assignment. The Safety Development Team (DT) will rank-order management-nominated
  candidates for Air Force-wide CDE competition. The Safety DT will forward CDE
  nomination endorsed packages to the AFPC CDE Program Manager. All CDE nomination
  packages are prepared and forwarded to the Air Force CDE Selection Board Panel.
  13.10.4. Tuition Assistance. The Civilian Tuition Assistance Program is an Air Force
  quality-of-life initiative designed to benefit the Air Force mission by providing assistance for
  job or mission-related courses at accredited colleges and universities taken during non-duty
  hours. The Safety Career Field will not fund entire degree programs of study but will fund
  individual mission-related courses as funding permits and IAW appropriate Air Force
  training guidance. Tuition assistance will not pay for non-instructional costs (i.e., payment
  for books, computers, or related fees). Assure requested training is appropriate and is a
  course approved by the Safety CFMT and/or a course on the approved Leadership
  Development portfolio. The tuition assistance package for each class/course must include a
  completed SF 182 template, course description from the college catalog, course cost from the
  college catalog, and the civilian tuition assistance program agreement. For OPM courses, a
  Student Information Sheet (SIS) must be obtained by the Safety CFMT and sent to
  AFPC/DPIFDA electronically prior to submitting the SF 182. All requests for tuition
  assistance must be submitted to the Safety CFMT NLT 30 days prior to class start date.
  Reference Air Force Instruction 36-401, Employee Training and Development, Chap. 9,
  Civilian Tuition Assistance Program (CTAP); and in this publication Chap 1, Section 1F –
  Training and Development, Paragraph 1.35., Tuition Assistance.
  13.10.5. Management and Leadership Development Training. The FAC and DT will
  provide guidance on priorities for centrally-managed training funds.

14.2. EXECUTIVE PANELS. The Advisory Council Chair may appoint executive panels to
assist the Council to design, implement, and maintain the program. The panel chairs will be
Scientist and Engineer Advisory Council Members. Members of the panels will represent the
various scientific and engineering disciplines. The Chair may designate ad hoc panels to meet
special temporary requirements. Areas within the purview and influence of the Council include,
but are not limited to the following:
   14.2.1. Requirements - Analyze Air Force Scientist and Engineer skill and population
   requirements and provide data to the Policy Council for input into Recruiting, Retention, and
   Career development policies.
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                      103


   14.2.2. Recruiting and Retention - Analyze overall Air Force recruiting and retention
   policies and develop policies for the requirement and allocation of intern spaces, as well as
   intern selection, training, and placement.
   14.2.3. Force Development - Formulate guidance on the types of training to be provided
   and the procedures for allocating short-term and long-term training for career program
   registrants and interns. Force Development also involves identifying positions Air Force-
   wide to be centrally managed by the SECFT and overseeing the formulation of promotion
   plans used to screen candidates for position vacancies. Work group members, like panel
   members, will be senior scientists and engineers from various Air Force locations.
14.3. Career Mobility. In addition to the mobility requirements identified in Chapter 1,
paragraph 1.9, all GS-15s (and equivalents under other pay systems) are required to be mobile
IAW AFI 36-202. For other centrally managed positions geographic mobility will be a voluntary
feature.
14.4. CENTRALLY MANAGED POSITIONS. The SECFT will centrally manage Air Force-
wide S&E positions, including designated excepted service positions, in the following
categories: 1) all S&E supervisory positions (Air Force Supervisory levels 1–5) at or above the
GS-12, IA3, DR 2, NH 3 and NJ 4 level, with the exception of base level Air Force supervisory
code 4 positions; 2) all S&E non-supervisory positions in the GS-15, IA5, NH 4, and DR 4
levels. Such positions must also be in one of the S&E occupational series and meet the S&E
career field criteria as listed in Figure 14.1. Exemptions from SECFT referral for centrally
managed positions may be requested by making a written justification to the SECP. The
Advisory Council Chair or designee will serve as the authority for these requests.
14.5. MANAGEMENT INITIATED ASSIGNMENTS FOR CENTRALLY MANAGED
POSITIONS.
   14.5.1. Assignments Involving a PCS. The S&E Functional Manager must approve these
   reassignments in advance. The requesting official will send a written request to the SECFT,
   through the CPS and provide position CPCN, series, grade, title, office symbol, and
   candidate's name and SSN and justifying reasons for the reassignment. The SECFT will
   confirm qualifications; determine satisfactory appraisal; confirm awareness of losing and
   gaining functional managers/supervisors; and obtain Functional Manager approval.
   14.5.2. Assignments Not Involving a PCS. The supervisor will notify the SECFT in
   writing before the action, providing all information required in paragraph 14.5.1 above.
   Functional Manager approval is not required. In the event a Management Initiated
   Reassignment is requested for an individual who does not meet minimum requirements as
   identified in the appropriate series template, a waiver request will be forwarded to the
   SECFT for review and approval by the designated panel chair or functional manager.

14.6. TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
  14.6.1. Internships.
      14.6.1.1. Palace Acquire (PAQ) Intern Program. The SECFT participates in the PAQ
      Intern Program, which is a centrally-managed and funded recruitment program used to
      provide resources for hard to fill positions. The S&E PAQ Program is a development and
      training program that provides two or three-year internships for hard-to-fill positions.
      The three-year program allows applicants with a Bachelor‘s degree to receive on-the-job
      training the first and third years of the internship. During the second year, the applicant
      attends graduate school full-time and fully paid. The two-year program allows applicants
      with a Master‘s degree to receive two years of on-the-job training. Upon completion of
      the program, interns are promoted to journeyman engineers or scientists. Other
      entitlements that the program provides are recruitment bonuses, the Student Loan
      Repayment Program, and non-competitive annual salary increases. Contact the SECFT
      for more information.
      14.6.1.2. Science, Mathematics And Research for Transformation (SMART)
      Program. Scholarship for the SMART Program has been established by the Department
      of Defense (DoD) to support undergraduate and graduate students pursuing degrees in
      Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The program
      aims to increase the number of civilian scientists and engineers working for the Air
      Force. The SMART Program is also open to civilian DoD employees. Contact the
      SECFT for more information.
  14.6.2. Tuition Assistance (TA). The SECFT will provide funding for employees who are
  currently in the S&E career field and meet S&E Career Program requirements. Contact
  SECFT at AFPC, Randolph AFB, TX for details.
      14.6.2.1. Tuition Assistance Funding. S&E will fund approved tuition and lab fees
      from accredited college and university courses. All courses must be related to the job or
      the mission of the organization; must improve individual or organizational performance;
      and assist an agency in achieving its mission and performance goals. All courses must be
      graduate level courses; prerequisite undergraduate courses for acceptance into a graduate
      degree program will not be funded. Acceptable SECFT degree programs include:
      technical masters degree, technical management masters degree, masters in business
      administration, masters of art in management, or a technical doctoral degree. Individuals
      may also apply for one continuing education graduate or undergraduate course per fiscal
      year (October through September), without a degree program.

     14.6.2.2. Funding limitations. Tuition assistance is approved on a first come, first
     served basis. Submission of a mission-related request for TA does not constitute
     automatic approval. For individuals currently on acquisition positions, TA pays 100% of
     tuition costs and lab fees. For individuals on currently non-acquisition positions, TA
     pays 75% of tuition costs and lab fees. Also, as per AFI 36-401, Chapter 9 rules,
     effective 1 Jul 05, non-acquisition limits cannot exceed $187.50 per semester hour,
     $124.50 per quarter hour, or $3,500 per fiscal year. TA will not exceed a lifetime limit of
     $18,000 for a masters and $30,000 for a doctoral degree. TA will not be provided, in
     whole or in part, for courses for which the employee is receiving other federal or state
     tuition subsidies such as Veterans Administration educational benefits, scholarships or
     grants, etc.
  14.6.3. Scientist and Engineer Career Development Guide. SAF/AQR develops and
  maintains a Scientist and Engineer Career Development Guide to guide scientists and
  engineers toward the experience, education, and training important for successful
  performance and career progression. The development guide suggests education and self-
  development activities, desired training, and typical assignments for entry-level, technical
  and managerial track scientists and engineers. Visit the SAF/AQR web page on the Air Force
  Portal to view the development guide for the Scientist & Engineer career field.
     14.6.3.1. S&E Career Paths. There are three career paths for the scientist and engineer
     workforce to pursue -- Technical Expert (to ST/SL), Manager/Leader (to SES), and
     Senior Leader (to SES) path. These path and their definitions are found in Figure 14.2.
     14.6.3.2. S&E Career Planning Diagram. This is the S&E career planning roadmap.
     The SECFT develops and maintains an S&E career planning diagram to guide civilian
     S&Es toward the experience, education, and training important for successful
     performance and career progression. The career planning diagram suggests education
     and self-development activities, acquisition certification levels, desired training, and
     typical assignments for entry-level, mid-level, and senior-level S&Es. The base of this
     pyramid conveys that S&E employees must have a solid foundation in the technical side
     to expect a successful career regardless of the path of preference. The S&E career
     planning diagram is at Figure 14.3.
  14.6.4. S&E Development Teams. In January 2005 the Scientist and Engineer Advisory
  Council (SEAC) established two S&E development teams to review individual career
  development plans and provide their best career development advice (called vectors). The
  Senior Development Team (SDT) is comprised of S&E SESs and general officers across the
  S&E community. The SDT provides force development guidance to S&E GS-15 and
  equivalent grades. The Intermediate Development Team (IDT) is comprised of S&E GS-15
  and equivalent grades and provides force development guidance to S&E GS-12-14 and
  equivalent grades.

  14.6.5. S&E Executive and Intermediate Leadership Development Initiatives (S&E
  ELDI and ILDI). S&E ELDI and ILDI are GS-15/equivalent and GS-14/equivalent
  corporate reassignment processes through which critical, S&E leadership positions are filled
  with aspirants who are developing their careers based on the SES Accessions
  Template. S&E ELDI and ILDI selections are intended to provide experience in the areas of
  technical, organizational, or functional breadth, as well as significant leadership
  challenges. Many of Air Force‘s most important S&E leader positions have been designated
  for corporate-management using these initiatives. S&Es who are approved for inclusion in
  the S&E ELDI or ILDI reassignment candidate pools are considered for S&E ELDI or ILDI
  position vacancies, and there is no penalty if they decline consideration for a particular
  position or location. S&E ELDI and ILDI assignment tenures are planned for two to four
  years. The invitation for S&Es to opt-in to be considered for the S&E ELDI or ILDI is
  usually linked with the annual GS-15 /equivalent SDT cycle and the annual supervisory GS-
  14/equivalent IDT cycle. Approved S&E ELDI and ILDI candidates must meet the SDT or
  IDT criteria for experience and credentials, and they must be available for a reassignment as
  determined by the SDT or IDT. Prerequisites for S&E ELDI and ILDI candidate
  consideration are: 1) an advanced degree and 2) a strong willingness for geographic mobility.
  Contact the SECFT for more information.
  14.6.6. Career Broadening. Refer to Chapter 1 for general information on the AF career
  broadening program. The SECFT provides career broadening opportunities to develop
  individual's needs and capabilities. The assignments are normally no more than 30 months in
  length at select Air Force Installations determined by the Scientist and Engineer Advisory
  Council. A mobility statement is a prerequisite for the Career Broadening Program.
  14.6.7. Developmental Education. Civilian Developmental Education (CDE) opportunities
  are available to the S&E community.         This encompasses Academic, Intermediate
  Developmental Education, Senior Developmental Education, and Experiential programs.
  The S&E Development Team (DT) reviews Civilian Developmental Education applications
  and makes recommendations to the CDE board. Contact the SECFT for more information.
  The SECFT also sponsors individuals to the Management Development Center (MDC)
  courses for those individuals that have been identified by the DT through the vectoring
  process.

Figure 14.2. SCIENTIST & ENGINEER CIVILIAN CAREER PATH DESCRIPTIONS.
The Civilian Technical Expert Path (to ST/SL level)

Civilians may opt to continue on the Technical Expert Path, leading to increased in-depth,
technical experience. A few civilians on the Technical Expert path peak at the GS-14 or GS-15
grade level (or workforce project demonstration equivalent); even fewer make it to the Senior
Level (SL) or Scientific and Professional (ST) level.

Unlike the Senior Leaders and Manager/Leaders, the Technical Expert aspires to become an
expert in a selected field, recognized at the national or international level. As such, this path
allows for pursuit of further technical expertise rather than broadening into management. While
the goal is eventually to be recognized as an expert, progression through the ranks also allows
the Technical Expert to grow. By maintaining technical expertise, the civilian Technical Expert
is able to develop and maintain relationships with the communities using that technology,
assuring mission requirements are met. Technical Experts tend to strive toward more technical
assignments, PhDs, and technical training over management and leadership assignments.

The Civilian Manager/Leader Path (to SES level)

Those who select the Manager/Leader Path will concentrate on both technical expertise and
technical management responsibilities. The scientist or engineer will be recognized as a
technical expert in at least one discipline, but will also accrue management experience through
supervisory positions. If you choose this path, you may serve as a project engineer, team leader,
or may supervise several project teams. Progression on this path, with its blend of technical
expertise and management skills, can lead to Senior Executive Service (SES) level positions,
although the preponderance of those on the path will peak at the GS-14 or GS-15 grade level (or
workforce project demonstration equivalent).

Early in an S&E‘s career, the attributes of the Manager/Leader and Senior Leader are very
similar. Those in either group have high performance appraisals, first line supervisory
experience, appropriate acquisition professional development program (APDP) level 2
certification and Professional Military Education (PME) through intermediate service school
(ISS). In addition, both have excellent communication skills and are able to articulate extremely
technical issues to diverse groups. The career paths do not really accrue distinction until around
the grade of GS-14 (or workforce project demonstration equivalent).

In contrast, as the Manager/Leader moves past the GS-14 level (or workforce project
demonstration equivalent), assignments tend to remain in technical development and technical
management, as refinement and development of the specialty continues. Manager/Leaders have
advanced degrees, lead organizations and people, and have completed the appropriate PME. The
Manager/Leader does not have the level of specialization of a Technical Expert but still retains
the technical experience and background, which makes them much more than a generalist.

The Civilian Senior Leader Path (to SES level)

The Senior Leader Path is for S&Es who choose to balance technical depth with breadth of
alternate functional experience. Through communications and interactions with other career
fields, organizational disciplines and AF operations, the Senior Leader becomes more of a
strategist than a technical expert. Technical grounding, management experience, and leadership
skills allow Senior Leaders to make the critical decisions that define organizational vision and
focus. Their responsibility lies in defining what an organization does, how it operates and how it
positions itself for the future. Broadening assignments provide the ―big-picture‖ view, equipping
these leaders with a variety of experiences to progress as high as the SES level. The civilian
Senior Leader is nurtured through Civilian Leadership Development and Civilian Competitive
Development Programs, as well as the Executive Resources Board.

Like the civilian Manager/Leader, as Senior Leaders progress past GS-14 (or workforce project
demonstration equivalent), they have further refined and expanded their skills and competencies.
They are able to lead people and to lead change within their organizations, and have held second
level supervisory positions. In addition, they have completed Senior Service School and have a
technical as well as a business Master‘s degree. As they progress, their assignments lead to
career-broadening opportunities, such as Program Management or Strategic Planning and
continue to broaden beyond technical expert and excel in all jobs.

          SECURITYCAREER FIELD MANAGEMENT PROGRAM (SCFMP)

15.1. FUNCTIONAL ADVISORY COUNCIL (FAC) STRUCTURE. The Council is chaired
by SAF/AAP, as the Security Functional Manager. The Career Field Manager will be the Vice
Chair. The Chief, Security Career Field and Security Career Field (SCF) Personnel will
participate in Council meetings in an advisory capacity and serve as primary interface between
the Council and the Directorate, Civilian Force Integration (AFPC/DPI). The Chief, SCF will
maintain current membership rosters. Council membership is comprised of the senior civilian
0080 from the following organizations/agencies:
   SAF/AAP(Chair)                    AETC/IP                       AF/A2RS
   ACC/IP                            AFCAF                         AFSFC

   SAF/AAZ                           AFE/IP                        AFGSC/IP
   AFOSI                             AFDW
15.2. CAREER FIELD MANAGERS (CFM). The security civilian career field consists
primarily of employees in job series 0080/0083/0085/0086. Under the single career field there
are two career field managers; one for security personnel (0080/6) and one for law enforcement
personnel (0083/5). SAF/AAP designates the CFM for security personnel and AF/A7S
designates the CFM for law enforcement personnel.
15.3. ADVISORY COUNCIL PANELS: The Council is supported by a standing Force
Development Team (DT). The Advisory Council Chairperson/Vice Chair will appoint panel
chairpersons and members. Panel activities will be guided by formal charters. Panels will
convene at the call of the Advisory Council Chairperson/Vice Chair to address and make
recommendations on appropriate career program issues.
   15.3.1. Development Team: This charter gives authorization to the Security (0080) Force
   Development Team through the Security Advisory Council to provide the necessary tools
   and guidance to career development program participants, offering them unique opportunities
   at the tactical, operational, and strategic development levels. Implementation will be realized
   through a series of decisions that provide deliberate and rewarding challenges in education,
   training, and experience across the Air Force and DoD. The overall result will be a highly
   educated corps of civilian security professionals with broad experience and superior
   leadership skills ready to carry the Air Force well into the next century.
   15.3.2. The Security Functional Manager (FM) (SAF/AAP) will chair the FDT and represent
   HAF/DRU security specialists. The Security Career Field Manager (CFM) will be
   designated by the FM, will co-chair the FDT, and will represent security specialist personnel
   from within their respective organization/MAJCOM/Agency. All voting members of the
   FDT will be comprised from AF positions designated as Strategic. FDT membership will
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                        113


   represent AF security specialists from across the spectrum of multi-disciplines, organizations,
   and functions. Therefore, the FDT will consist of a permanent representative from the
   AFCAF, AF/A2RS, AFISRA, SAF/AAZ and NRO in addition to a representative from the
   top four (4) MAJCOMs based upon the population of 0080 personnel serviced by that
   MAJCOM. AFSFC will be included as a representative so long as the FDT represents 0083
   and 0085 personnel within Security Forces or AFSFC has a population of 0080s in
   comparison to the top four MAJCOMS. There will be two additional seats on the FDT
   comprised of membership from the remaining MAJCOMs on a two year rotational basis.
   Voting members are limited to the senior Air Force civilians (GS-15 or DCIPS pay band
   equivalent) from the following MAJCOMs/Agencies. Voting Members will be derived from:
       SAF/AAP               A2S/AF ISR             AFCAF                  NRO
       SAF/AAZ               AETC                   AFGSC                  AFMC
       AFSFC                 AFSPC                  AMC                    AFRC
       PACAF                 USAFE                  AFSOC                  ACC
   15.3.3. Roles and Responsibilities: Areas within the purview and influence of the Security
   (0080) Force Development Team include, but are not limited to:
       15.3.3.1. Provide vector to force development participants on Career Development Plans
       (CDPs), mentoring, accessions, educational opportunities, career development, career
       broadening, and career-path issues.
       15.3.3.2. Prepare and implement a professional development methodology. Provide
       feedback on policy issues, career field issues, etc, affecting force/career development to
       the Security Advisory Council and Functional Manager.
       15.3.3.3. Provide candidate fill position recommendations to selecting officials in
       conjunction with vectoring responsibilities above.
       15.3.3.4. Other duties as assigned by the Security Advisory Council.
15.4. CAREER MOBILITY. The SCFP strongly encourages mobility for all employees.
Mobility provides employees a major avenue to acquire depth and breadth of experience for
career progression and managerial development; it provides management with a pool of
individuals who have clearly demonstrated the potential for continued growth and broader
responsibility. Mobility between functional areas within the security career field is critical to
achieving the multi-disciplined workforce demanded by current mission requirements. While
mobility does not always require geographic relocation, geographic relocation provides optimum
experiences. Therefore, geographic mobility is encouraged through voluntary assignment
preferences, but may also be required in the best interest of the Air Force. Employees in GS-14
and 15 (and equivalent) positions are subject to worldwide mobility.
15.5. EXTERNAL APPLICANTS. External applicant referral certificates will be provided to
supplement Internal applicant referral certificates for (grades 09- 13 and equivalent DCIPS pay
bands) when requested by the Selection Official. For grades GS-14 and GS-15 and (DCIPS
equivalent pay band), the Selection Official must request approval to consider candidates from
external sources from the FAC Chair prior to the issuance of a referral certificate.

          15.8.1.1.4. Priority IV- Other program participants.
   15.8.2. Career Broadening. The SCFP will administer their Career Broadening program
   with guidance and direction provided by the DT. The Career Broadening Program is
   described in Chapter 1.
       15.8.2.1. The DT will assign approved career broadening positions to organizations in
       specific locations, taking into account the Air Force Mission and the broadening needs of
       the top-ranked candidates. When selected for assignment to one of these positions, the
       individual normally will serve a period, not to exceed duration of 30 months, with follow-
       on to a permanent position.
       15.8.2.2. Approximately six months prior to completion of the career broadening
       assignment, the CFT will assist in the outplacement of the career broadener through
       Career Program channels. The CFT will fully coordinate all post broadening assignment
       actions with the functional community and the gaining and losing servicing CPSs.
       15.8.2.3. Selection to a career broadening opportunity does not obligate the vacated
       position as would formal ―return rights.‖
   15.8.3. Career Enhancement. The Advisory Council will approve Career Enhancement
   positions. Individuals selected for these positions will normally serve a period of three to
   four years‘ duration. Upon entry, the selectee must sign a mobility agreement. Selection to a
   career enhancement opportunity does not obligate the vacated position as would formal
   ―return rights‖. All eligible program employees should consider this position and participate
   in the special development associated with it.
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                        115


15.9. CENTRALLY MANAGED POSITIONS. All GS-0080, grades GS-09 through GS-15
(DCIPS pay band equivalents), except Air Reserve Technicians, are centrally managed.
   15.9.1. For centrally managed positions within the security career field, selection officials
   will employ a criterion based selection process. Selection criteria and minimum
   qualifications will be developed in advance of the vacancy announcement. The criteria will
   be based on the position requirements as outlined in the Position Description, vacancy notice,
   and reflect supervisory requirements, pay schedule and/or band. The selection document will
   be quantitatively based. The Career Field Team (CFT) has recommended, standardized
   selection form available that can be modified to reflect unique aspects of any position.
   Custom selection forms may be used, but must contain at a minimum the categories and
   weighted scores contained in the standardized form and reflect a balanced set of weighted
   criteria. Ratings will be completed on all applicants and retained for a minimum of ninety
   (90) days after the selection is complete. Candidates may be selected using both internal and
   external certifications with the understanding that internal candidates are reviewed and rated
   before external applicants. Selection will be based on the highest rated cumulative score.
   Should a tie develop between the highest rated internal and external applicant, the internal
   applicant will be given preference. Should a selection be appealed, the selection official
   must provide the applicants rated score, the average, cut off and selection applicant‘s score
   coupled with a narrative of the selection process.
   15.9.2. Positions identified as Strategic in any category now fall under the review of the
   Security 0080 Force Developmental Team (FDT) and the CFM. These positions are
   identified as key senior civilian positions in the Air Force and assignments to these positions
   require the most stringent review.
   15.9.3. The FDT will review all personnel and applicant certificates for Security GS-15 and
   DCIPS Pay Band 5 positions to include MAJCOM Directors of Information Protection,
   providing by rank order the top five (5) recommended personnel to the CFM and the
   selecting official. The selecting official will make the final selection from this list in
   coordination with the CFM to make the Management Reassignment decision. A waiver for
   conventional selection will only be approved by the CFM and only in exceptional
   circumstances.
   15.9.4. The FDT, like its military counterpart, has been charged with the responsibility of
   identifying and selection individuals for career broadening assignments and schools. Unlike
   their military counterparts, personnel assigned have not had the assurance of appropriate
   follow-on assignments to effectively use their newly acquired skills and knowledge. The
   FDT is charged with identifying and recommending placement assignments within the Air
   Force to the CFM, who in consultation with selecting officials will use Management
   Reassignment authorities. In addition, this process applies to Palace Acquire Interns and
   civilians assigned OCONUS without follow-on assignments.

   (regardless if the entry grade is below program coverage), management must provide a
   written request with justification to the CFT through the servicing Civilian Personnel Section
   (CPS). The CFT Chief has been delegated the authority to approve/disapprove requests on
   behalf of the Advisory Council Chair
   17.4.2. Classification Actions. CPSs may upgrade and fill encumbered positions when the
   upgrade is due to classification error, new or revised standards, or reconstitution of the
   incumbent‘s position and competition is not required. The CPSs must notify the AFICF
   Team of the action. However, if competition is required, the CPS must forward the request
   through the CFT for recruitment action.
17.5. EXTERNAL FILLS. Defense Civilian Intelligence Personnel System (DCIPS), allows
management to make selections from any source. In addition to generating referral certificates
for internal candidates (i.e., current AF civilians), the AFICF allows for referral of all types of
external candidates (e.g., transfers from other agencies, reinstatements, and non-status
individuals) for any of its covered positions. Therefore, organizations are encouraged to utilize
this ―one-stop shopping‖ referral service for external recruitment as well.
17.6. TRAINING & Development
   17.6.1. Competitive Training. Selections for funded competitive training will consider
   factors such as relevance of courses to employee‘s duties and training needs; time in grade;
   time in service; appraisal scores; and awards. (Also refer to Chapter 1 Section F).
   17.6.2. Intelligence Community Joint Duty Assignment Program (ICJDA/JDA).
   Referred to as a ―Goldwater-Nichols for intelligence civilians,‖ JDA is a community-
   managed assignment program designed to promote and encourage two- to three-year
   rotational assignments as details across Intelligence Community (IC) functions, positions,
   and geographic locations. The JDA is designed to provide civilian employees with increased
   breadth/depth of experience and a broader understanding of IC missions and functions. The
   JDA builds and sustains a professional civilian intelligence corps with a community
   perspective similar to that gained by military personnel through their joint assignment
   requirements.     The JDA infuses new perspectives, knowledge, and expertise into
   participating organizations. The AF Intelligence CF Team administers AF participation in
   the ICJDA. Contact the AFPC Intelligence CFT at 210-565-4587/1982 or DSN 665-
   4587/1982 for more information.

   AIR RESERVE TECHNICIAN OFFICER CAREER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
                             (AOCMP)

18.1. FUNCTIONAL ADVISORY COUNCIL (FAC) STRUCTURE. The Career
Management Board (CMB) serves as the Advisory Council for the Air Reserve Technician
Officer Career Management Program (AOCMP). AFRC/CC is the Chair and AFRC/CV is the
Vice Chair. The Career Management Board is composed of senior leaders appointed by
AFRC/CC who assist in developing objectives, requirements, guidance, planned assignments,
and career progression for high potential officers, regardless of status, ie. ART, AGR, TR or
IMA.
18.2. EXECUTIVE PANELS. Force Management and Development Council (FMDC). The
FMDC is established by the Chief, Air Force Reserve to provide inputs for guidance and
instruction for all reserve communities. The FMDC is instrumental in shaping, advocating, and
monitoring how functional communities execute their force development responsibilities.
18.3. CENTRALLY MANAGED POSITIONS & CAREER PROGRAM REFERRAL.
   18.3.1. All ART Officer positions are centrally managed. No other Air Force career
   program will include ART positions. Filling ART Officer positions will be accomplished
   through AFRC/A1CSA, who serves as the trusted agent of the CMB. Generally, entry level
   and trainee positions will be filled from external sources, such as ART Special Examining
   Unit (SEU) competitive registers, Veterans Readjustment Appointment (VRA), Veterans
   Employment Opportunity Act (VEOA) of 1998, reinstatement candidates, etc.
   18.3.2. Local AFR commanders, assisted by CPSs and AFPC, manage all AFRC positions
   not centrally managed by AFRC and the career development of AFRC personnel not
   covered by this program. This includes ART enlisted positions and non-ART positions and
   the assigned individuals. For AFRC positions/employees not covered by AOCMP, AFPC
   provides referral certificates to selecting officials through the local merit promotion system
   or other authorized recruitment sources.
18.4. CAREER MOBILITY/MOBILITY FOR KEY POSITIONS. AFR command-wide
geographic mobility is a condition of employment for all ART officer positions. Before
assignment for any covered position, each employee or appointee must sign a Mobility
Certificate committing to accept assignment to AFRC jobs at other locations. (The form is Air
Reserve Technician (ART) Program Certificate of Understanding, AFRC Form 121). The
AOCMP places personal and career needs of the individual subordinate only to the best interests
of AFRC when determining assignments.

18.5. MANAGEMENT INITIATED ASSIGNMENTS. AFRC/CC/CV are in the direct
supervisory chain of all ART officers. All ART officers must sign a command-wide mobility
agreement; therefore, AFRC/CC/CV maintains the authority to direct the reassignment of any
and all ART officers to positions for which they qualify. All permanent ART officer actions,
e.g., reassignment, promotion, change to lower grade, and initial appointment, must be approved
by AFRC. The filling of ART officer positions by temporary promotions, which exceed 120
days, is through career program referral. In unusual situations, AFRC/CC/CV may approve
reassignments/ change to lower grade outside the auspices of the career program [the employee
would not be entitled to pay retention, Relocation Services (RS) Program, or Home Marketing
Incentive Program (HMIP); a PCS may be allowed, but IAW the JTR, Vol. 2, management may
elect not to offer a house hunting trip or TQSE].

     CPS/AFPC processes the action.
     18.8.8.6. Proposed management-directed assignments to ART officer positions require
     AFRC approval prior to the action being effected.

  18.8.10. Overseas Assignments & ART Eligibility. ARTs going to non-ART overseas
  positions have return rights to their ART position only if they are still militarily qualified. If
  an ART loses Reserve status, or is unwilling to accept placement into their previous ART
  position, ARFC will provide return placement into the ART position and take action for an
  employee who is ineligible or unwilling to maintain active Reserve membership. In
  determining active Reserve eligibility and continued employment in the ART position,
  employees will be treated as though they never left the ART position. Employees are not
  automatically entitled to a non-ART position if they are no longer eligible or willing to
  maintain Reserve eligibility.
  18.8.11. Supplemental Guidance. AFRC will provide further guidance/instruction as
  appropriate (e.g., AFRCI 36-111).

19.8. WEATHER CAREER FIELD DEVELOPMENT PATHS.
  19.8.1. WCF Development Themes (All Career Paths). Completion of education, both
  academic degree completion and CDE/PME, are emphasis areas for professional
  development. Tactical level and early operational level development focuses on individual
  professional and technical proficiency. Operational and strategic level development adds
  focus on Intermediate through Senior CDE/PME, advanced academic degree completion,
  supervisory experience and depth and breadth of job experiences within the functional career
  field, as well as corporate breadth at multiple organizational levels of the AF.
  19.8.2. Operational Weather Career Path. This weather career path‘s primary focus is on
  characterizing the environment and assisting AF and Army operators with the ability to
  exploit and optimize mission planning and execution based on the effects of weather on both
  friendly and threat force operations. Positions at both tactical and operational levels of
  development are found at base level and in weather squadrons or groups. Base and level
  positions primarily focus on the supported units‘ missions. Positions at Operational Weather
  Squadrons and Groups primarily focus on theater/regional, functional mission areas, or
  providing worldwide reach-back operational weather support. These positions employ both
  weather technicians (1341) and professional meteorologists (1340). This development path
  normally plateaus at the GS 12/13 level for 1340s and at the GS 9/10 level for 1341s. This
  career path is an ideal development track that can feed both the Technical Expert Career Path
  and Management/Leader Career Paths described below.
  19.8.3. Technical Expert Career Path. This weather career path spans operational level to
  strategic level positions with a focus on technical expertise. Professional positions (1340)
  serve as organization experts in one or more disciplines of meteorology for the assigned unit.
  These positions are normally filled with advanced academic degree holders. The technical
  expert path provides growth to GS-15 and equivalent and SL/ST positions. The technical
  expert career path also includes senior weather technicians (1341) with highly specialized
  expertise on weather systems and weather operations. The senior technician positions
  provide growth to GS 10/11 within the technical path. These positions are normally found at
  HAF, FOA, Lab, Center or MAJCOM levels.
  19.8.4. Management and Leader Career Path. This career path spans Operational Level
  to Strategic Level Positions with a focus on first and higher level supervisory positions or
  managing weather support operations and programs at HAF, FOA, Lab, Center, or
  MAJCOMs. Positions on this track normally enter at GS-13 and equivalent and can progress
  to GS-15 and SES. Both the Operational Weather Career Path and Technical Expert Career
  Path provide development tracks into the Management and Leader Career Path.

    OPERATIONS (OPS) CAREER FIELD MANAGEMENT PROGRAM (OCFMP)

20.1. Operations Career Field Progression and Development Templates. Three Operations
(Ops) levels of career development are described in this section: Tactical, Operational, and
Strategic. Each developmental level identifies suggested competencies and the path an AF Ops
civilian should follow throughout their career. Figure 20.1 highlights a typical career
progression in Ops. Developmental templates are used to assist and guide discussions between
Ops career team members and their supervisors/managers for suggested career paths and plans
for an Ops career professional.
20.2. Ops Tactical Development Level – Personal Leadership The Tactical Developmental
Level establishes the basic operational foundation and baseline for an Ops career field
professional. During this professional phase each individual will master their primary duties,
build warfighting skills, build joint and coalition knowledge, and develop institutional
competencies while gaining valuable expertise and experience. The overall goal is for every Ops
person to gain an in-depth understanding of their critical skill sets, AF culture by embracing the
AF‘s Core Values, team leadership (followership), and institutional leadership while executing
the daily Ops mission. Targeted and specific assignments are designed to establish and build in-
depth knowledge and technical expertise. Training and educational opportunities will be offered
for those progressing and identified as having leadership potential at higher command levels.
Figure 20.1 highlights a desired developmental path at the Tactical Level.

20.3. Ops Operational Development Level – Leading People and Teams At the Operational
Developmental Level, AF civilian members transition from a specialist or followership role to
leadership responsibilities where campaigns and major operations are planned, conducted, and
sustained to accomplish strategic objectives. Ops team members must understand the broader
AF perspective and capabilities to execute operations, hone joint and coalition understanding
while combining broad occupational skills and AF competencies such as focusing on Personal,
People/Team Building, and Organizational functions.

    While employed at the Operational Level career broadening and cross-functional
    assignment opportunities must be considered to increase career growth potential and value
    across the AF. Career functional team leaders will focus on identifying and developing
    Ops professionals for the Strategic Level.

20.4. Ops Strategic Development Level – Leading Institutions At the Strategic Level, AF
civilian members combine highly developed occupational and enduring competencies to bring an
AF perspective in determining and accomplishing national or multinational (coalition) security
objectives. These skills will be used to develop and use valuable national resources to
accomplish these objectives. Often these tasks include developing an understanding of leadership
at institutional and interagency levels in executing AF operations within a joint, coalition, and
interagency relationship. The objective at the Ops Strategic Level is to broaden the Ops
professional‘s institutional competencies with focus on Organizational functions listed in
paragraph 20.3

Figure 20.4. Ops Strategic Development Template.




20.5. Ops Development Planning The vision of Civilian Force Development is to create a
civilian workforce that is responsive to requirements and can be managed as an integral part of
the Total Force, including mobility, where it serves the AF and the Ops mission. Through robust
career field management, integrated leadership education, and clearly defined requirements, Ops
will integrate the development of Ops civilians with their military counterparts. The end result is
a Total Force that can lead and be managed as one and where civilian and military roles can be
interchangeable.
AFMAN36-606 3 MAY 2011                                                                        137


20.6. Centrally Managed Positions. Through central management of core positions within the
Ops, the Development Team (DT) and senior Ops leaders will have an opportunity to
deliberately develop team members for positions of increased responsibilities in the career field.
In turn, these positions will afford Ops team members focused education and training and
provide assignment experiences that are supported by mentoring at all levels from seasoned Ops
professionals. The DT has defined Centrally Managed positions as operational and strategic
level positions (GS-13 through GS-15 grade level). Centrally Managed positions also include
three types of Career Developmental positions: Career Broadening, Key Developmental, and
Palace Acquire. Each of these positions will provide developmental work experiences intended
to prepare Ops team members for higher-level supervisory and managerial positions. Ops team
members in Centrally Managed positions are entitled to centrally funded moves (PCS) and other
development opportunities to include short-term management and leadership training, CDE, and
tuition assistance.
20.7. Ops Career Broadening Program. The Ops Career Broadening Program leverages the
headquarters, Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) Career Broadening program that is available
to all career fields. This program is designed to broaden the skills and enhance leadership
perspective of high-potential and exceptional personnel. Annually, the Ops DT will review and
recommend AF candidates that have been vectored for career broadening assignments in
compliance with AFPC DT Meeting Cycle responsibilities. Assignments are scheduled for 30
months and require a mobility agreement and training and development plan.
20.8. Career Mobility. Effective career field management mandates filling high-level positions
with qualified personnel who have a variety of work experiences. These varied experiences may
not be gained in a single position or at only one installation or organizational level. Ops team
members should seek such work experiences in more than one location or organization. The
depth and breadth of experience gained through developmental and geographic mobility may be
the factor that makes a candidate the best qualified for referral. Ops professionals seeking
executive management positions should remain available for reassignment to fulfill mission
needs.
20.9. Management—Initiated Reassignments (M/R) A M/R may be accomplished by
reassigning an employee to a vacant position or by swapping two employees between positions.
There are two types of M/Rs: reassignments within the Ops functional community, and
reassignments from outside the Ops. All M/Rs into a Centrally Managed position must be routed
through the CFT and approved by the Career Field Manger and DT.
20.10. Ops Certification and Career Development Program (CCDP) Quality training and
continual educational growth play an essential role in the AF‘s ability to accomplish its mission
and identify leaders with the talent and potential for senior civilian positions. Therefore, it is
crucial that senior leaders become involved in planning, developing, managing, conducting, and
evaluating an effective and efficient training program across all the Tactical, Operational and
Strategic Levels. Ops senior functionals will leverage the AF Ops CCDP to identify, assess, and
nominate competitive Ops individuals for appropriate training along the career growth path.
Detailed information about CCDP will be found in the DoD Certification and Career
Development Guidelines, which will be available for download on the Ops Programs website.
