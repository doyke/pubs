     AFRL employee.

     Career Award with coordination through the potential candidate's Technology Directorate
     (TD)/711th Human Performance Wing (HPW). The TD/711 HPW will define the processes
     by which it will consider all suggested individuals and identify up to two personnel to be
     nominated by the TD/711 HPW.
     2.3. AFRL/CZ is responsible for impaneling an Early Career Award recommendation
     committee to evaluate the nomination packages received from the TD/711 HPW. The

     2.4. For nominations containing classified materials, the nominating TD/711 HPW will
     prepare an addendum to the nomination package classified at the secret level. That
     addendum will characterize the impact of the work in terms of scientific achievement or
     program leadership. Any addendum classified at or below collateral secret will be provided
     to all cleared recommendation committee members.
     2.5. AFRL/CZ is responsible for forwarding Early Career Award recommendations to AFRL
     Executive Director (AFRL/CA) and ultimately AFRL Commander (AFRL/CC).
     2.6. Final selection of Early Career Award is the responsibility of AFRL/CC.
3. Eligibility.
     3.1. The nominee must be a young scientist or engineer who has contributed an
     accumulation of outstanding theoretical and/or experimental work during their career as an
     AFRL researcher. Prior research contribution will be considered but maximum consideration
     will be given to research performed as an AFRL employee. Both civilian and military
     members are eligible.
     3.2. The nominee must be within the first seven years of their government career, regardless
     of age. The award shall be granted without restriction to all AFRL researchers.

     nominations, typically in October.
     4.2. Nomination packages are due to AFRL/CZ by a date specified in the call, typically in
     September.      AFRL/CZ will subsequently impanel the AFRL Early Career Award
     recommendation committee to evaluate the candidates under consideration. The panel shall
     base its deliberations on individual scoring of each candidate. Rankings of the candidates by

   each member of the panel attending the scoring session shall be done using that scoring
   system.
   4.3. Nomination package formats should be conformed to Attachment 2.
   4.4. The committee’s recommendations will be forwarded to AFRL/CC, typically in

   will not be considered. Nominations are limited to one submission per TD/711 HPW. Late
   or incomplete nominations will not be accepted.
4.6. The Early Career Award Committee is appointed to serve in the selection of up to two
award recipients in a single year. The Research Council will discharge that committee by its
confirmation of the proposed award recipient(s). It is suggested that at least one member of the
committee be reappointed to the subsequent award committee to serve as Chair, fostering
experience and continuity. In the event that the award committee cannot identify a suitable
awardee, the committee will be discharged, with no award being made that year.
   4.7. The Research Council will decide whether to forward the nomination to the AFRL/CA.
   A condensed version of the nominating documents will be included when the nomination is
   forwarded to AFRL/CA. AFRL/CA will forward the nomination(s) to AFRL/CC to grant
   final approval. If the research council or AFRL/CA does not approve the selection(s), then
   the matter will be referred to the award committee for further action. This may entail
   obtaining additional information, selection of an alternate nominee, or postponing the award.
