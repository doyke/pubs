SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision updates Attachment 2 WETLANDS AREA MAP – YOUNGSTOWN ARS. It
also updates 910th Airlift Wing Commander (910 AW/CC).
1. Background. A wetland survey and delineation was conducted in September 2001 and in
March and April 2002 to assess the extent of Jurisdictional Waters and Wetlands present on the
site. The results of the wetland survey and delineation are documented in the Wetland
Identification and Delineation Report for Youngstown Air Reserve Station, Ohio and are
available in the 910th Mission Support Group Civil Engineer Environmental (910 MSG/CEV)
Files located in Building 510. In November 2006, the USACE issued authorization to
Youngstown ARS under Nationwide Permit No. 39 (USACOE Permit No.: 200201253) to fill
 2                                                      910AWI32-7000 17 DECEMBER 2012


0.49 acre of wetlands to construct a new Munitions Maintenance Facility Building 539. In 2008,
Youngstown ARS constructed the Munitions Maintenance Facility Building 539 and completed
the permitted wetlands impact of 0.49 acre. There are now approximately 11.49 acres of USACE
regulated jurisdictional wetlands and 0.89 acres of isolated wetlands regulated by the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA), for a total of approximately 12.86 acres of wetlands.
The Jurisdictional Wetlands and isolated wetlands are located in the northeastern wooded and
unimproved portions of the base property. In December 2007, the USACE conducted an on-site
field review and reassessment of wetland and water resources. The results of the USACE field
review and reassessment including updated Wetland Delineation Data Sheets and photographs
are documented in the Update & Revision of 2002 Wetland Identification and Delineation Report
at Youngstown Air Reserve Station, Ohio and are also available in the 910 MSG/CEV Files
located in Building 510.
2. Wetlands Regulations. Executive Orders, Federal, state and local laws and regulations
govern the protection of wetlands. AFI 32-7064, Chapter 3 addresses the protection of wetlands.
The regulations stipulate that wetlands will be protected and conserved through avoidance or
minimization of impact. The USACOE and/or OEPA are authorized to issue permits that are
required for the discharge of dredged or fill materials into wetlands. Even an inadvertent
encroachment into wetlands resulting in displacement or movement of soil or fill materials has
the potential to be viewed as a violation unless an appropriate permit is obtained from USACOE
and/or OEPA. Such impacts include construction as well as the incidental fill and grading of wet
depressions. For more information on the laws, regulations and guidelines affecting wetlands,
contact 910 MSG/CEV.
3. Wetlands Protection.
     3.1. The perimeter of the area in which the wetlands exist has been posted with signs reading
     ―Protected Wetlands – Do Not Disturb‖. Exercise caution to avoid all ground disturbances in
     or near wetland areas.
     3.2. Youngstown ARS personnel shall avoid all impacts to the Jurisdictional Wetlands and
     to the isolated wetlands identified on the installation. Training activities and development
     projects should be conducted or sited to avoid impacts to wetlands. If a project or activity
     requires encroachment into or disturbance of Jurisdictional Wetlands or isolated wetlands,
     contact 910 MSG/CEV to initiate the required procedures for approval and permitting. Any
     proposed action that impacts wetlands requires a Finding of No Practical Alternative
     (FONPA) approved by Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Occupational Safety,
     Health, and Environment (SAF/MIQ) in accordance with AFI 32-7064.
     3.3. On-foot training activities within the wetland boundaries should be planned and
     conducted to avoid all ground disturbances in or near wetland areas, and should be scheduled
     to avoid seasonally wet conditions during the spring. Motorized vehicles other than All
     Terrain Vehicles (ATVs) are not permitted to be used in the area in which the wetlands exist.
     ATVs shall stay on the existing semi-improved trail system within the wooded area. The use
     of ATVs through wet areas and standing water off of the trails shall be avoided at all times
