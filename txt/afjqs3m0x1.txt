SECTION A -- GENERAL INFORMATION

1. Purpose. This Air Force Job Qualification Standard (AFJQS) standardizes Services Missile
Chef on-the-job training (OJT). This document identifies the duties and tasks required to attain
qualification in a Missile Alert Facility (MAF). Use this document to plan and record all duty-
position related training, and as a basis for preparing a Master Task Listing (MTL) for each
functional area. Training managers, supervisors, trainers, trainees, and other functions use this
AFJQS to plan, conduct, and document OJT.

2. Qualification Standards. Personnel assigned to perform missile chef duties are trained and
qualified to the “Go” level. “Go” means the individual can perform the task without assistance
and meets local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures. (Note:
“Go” level equates to 3c in the proficiency code key). AF Job Qualification Standards pertain to
all organizations that support missile chef positions.

3. General Management.
A. This AFJQS will be maintained in the member’s OJT record while performing duties as a
missile chef.
B. Trainer and trainees will use this AFJQS in conjunction with the 3M0X1 Career Field
Education and Training Plan (CFETP). The CFETP outlines all upgrade training requirements
that are required, to include core tasks.
C. Use the AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation for additional/locally
required tasks specific to duty positions within a MAF. Documentation is accomplished IAW
AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program.
