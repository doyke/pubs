SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Changes include
updating the instruction number from TI 23-503 to TI 23-502 which aligns this publication with
AFI 23-502, Recoverable and Unusable Liquid Petroleum Products. Also, the changes made to
AFI 23-502 were incorporated into the TI 23-502. Finally, several office symbols and contact
numbers were updated.

1. General Policies:
     1.1. Organizations that generate recoverable or waste petroleum must adhere to this
     instruction. Every precaution will be taken to ensure foreign substances including different
     fuel types do not contaminate petroleum products.
     1.2. All recoverable fuel must meet minimum specifications IAW T.O. 42B-1-1 to be
     returned to the Fuels Management Flight.
2. Petroleum Products Stocked On Base: Currently, Tinker Air Force Base stocks JP5 and
JP8 aviation fuel; JP10 and PF1 missile fuel; unleaded regular, diesel and bio-diesel ground fuel.
3. Generators of Recoverable and Waste Products:
     3.1. Tinker AFB generating organizations include: 72 ABW/CEAN (Hazardous Material),
     564 AMXS/MXDPA (Tanker Production), 565 AMXS/MXDXA (Bomber Weapons System
     Support Center), OC-ALC/MXAQIQ (Bardes Services), 72 OSS/OSMT (TA), 72
     LRS/LGRF (Fuels Management), 72 LRS/LGRV (Transportation Division), 72 ABW Civil
     Engineering (CE), 72 FSS (Morale, Welfare, Recreation, and Services), AAFES (Base
     Exchange), 552 ACW (Maintenance Group), United States Navy Command Strategic
     Communications Wing-One, 507 MXS/MSMG and 507 AMXS/MXAS.
     3.2. Base Fuels Management and aircraft maintenance squadrons (aircraft maintenance and
     aerospace ground equipment (AGE) generate recoverable petroleum products from refueling
     unit sumps, bulk storage tank bottoms, aircraft sumps, aircraft requiring fuel cell inspections
     and repairs, and AGE equipment. Recoverable fuel will be collected and temporarily stored
     in portable fuel bowsers. Due to the restrictions placed on mission support defuelers, only
     defuel recoverable fuel from bowsers.
     3.3. Bowsers used to recover fuel drained from aircraft sumps or residual fuel must be clean
     and include a low point drain. Bowsers shall be marked for and restricted to a single grade of
     product. Use of large volume bowsers should be coordinated with local ground safety and
     the fire department. All water must be drained and stored in a separate container or bowser
     designated for waste water/fuel system icing inhibitor (FSII) mixture. Contact 72
     ABW/CEANO at 734-3546 for the Industrial Waste Services contractor to remove and
     dispose of the water/FSII mixture.
     3.4. Bowsers that contain flammable product shall be bonded to the product transfer point
     prior to and during product transfer operations. All bowsers shall have appropriate closure
     devices to prevent vaporization, entry of water or material other than the product being
     collected.
4. Collecting Recoverable or Waste Petroleum Products: Each organization is responsible
for establishing procedures on collecting recoverable or waste fuel products. Contact the Base
Environmental Coordinator for assistance. The Fuels Management Flight will provide
organizations owning support tanks the required tank custodian training classes and answer
questions or provide assistance on any fuel related problem.
5. Methods, Equipment, and Facilities Available to Collect, Store, Return to Inventory,
Reuse, Recycle, and Dispose of Products:
     5.1. Approved Containers: Portable fuel bowsers are approved containers for collecting
     petroleum products. There are approved fuel bowsers available for procurement through the
TINKER AFBI23-502 28 OCTOBER 2010                                                             3


   Logistics Readiness Squadron. Some of the National Stock Numbers are: 2330-01-300-
   4482 (600 gallon capacity); 2330-01-301-0753 (250 gallon capacity) and 2330-01-464-3666
   (600 gallon capacity).
   5.2. Bowsers used on a recurring basis to collect recoverable flammable petroleum products
   shall be painted and marked IAW T.O. 42B-1-23, paragraph 2-4c or table 2.1.
   5.3. Returning fuel to Base Fuels Management: Aviation fuel may be returned to the Fuels
   Management Flight provided it meets the established specifications IAW T.O. 42B-1-1 or
   may be downgraded to a different product IAW T.O. 42B-1-23. The Fuels Laboratory
   telephone (739-5067) is the coordination focal point to determine if the petroleum product is
   suitable for return to the base fuels inventory. The Fuels Control Center telephone (739-
   5066) is the focal point to obtain refueling units to defuel temporary storage bowsers. The
   Fuels Management Flight representative will determine quality and quantity of product.
   5.4. Returning Fuel to the Base Heating Plant: The base heating plant currently uses natural
   gas and will only accept DF-2 recoverable fuel. Products that cannot be downgraded and
   recovered by the Fuels Management Flight will be disposed of as used oil (see the Base
   Hazardous Waste Management Plan).
   5.5. Accounting for Fuel Returned to Base Fuels Management: A Base Fuels Management
   Flight representative will determine the quantity of product recovered and document it on a
   DD Form 1898, Energy Sale Slip. This form will be forwarded to the Fuels Accounting
   Office to be processed through the Standard Base Supply System for credit to the generating
   organization.
6. Storage and Disposal Requirements for Waste Petroleum Products: All waste petroleum
products will be stored and disposed of IAW TAFBI 32-7004, Hazard Waste Management
Instruction.
7. Waste Products Must Be Recycled Through Positive Means Whenever Possible. The
following prioritized guidelines have been established for sound property conservation
management of recoverable and waste petroleum products:
   7.1. On-specification fuel will be returned to the Base Fuels Management Flight’s inventory
   for use as the original grade.
   7.2. Off-specification fuel can be returned to the Base Fuels Management Flight for possible
   blending into the original product or downgrading to another product.
   7.3. Surplus/Waste Fuel: Fuel that can’t be returned to the Base Fuels Management Flight
   inventory should be categorized as surplus/waste fuel. This fuel will be disposed of IAW the
   Base Hazard Waste Management Plan.
