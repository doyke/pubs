1. Requirements. Note: For purposes of this instruction and to clarify terminology used in
numerous source documents, C&I system requirements, C4 system requirements, and
Information Technology (IT) requirements are all inclusive and one and the same.
Requirements arise from a deficiency in an existing operational capability, a need for a new
capability, or an opportunity to replace or modernize an existing system with improved
technology when operationally and economically practical. Requirements must be validated by
the applicable unit commander or wing CSO. Technical solutions to these requirements must be
compatible with DoD, Joint Service, Air Force, MAJCOM, and base C&I/C4/IT systems
LUKEAFBI33-103 3 DECEMBER 2013                                                              3


architecture, templates, blueprints, and plans.   Systems include, but are not limited to, the
following:
   1.1. Radio, RADAR, and other navigational aids for air traffic control and landing systems
   (ATCALS).
   1.2. Fixed-ground electronic devices.
   1.3. Ground electronic meteorological equipment.
   1.4. Land Mobile Radios (LMR), wire, telephones, and other means used for the electrical
   and visual transmission of encrypted or unencrypted messages.
   1.5. Non-command standard Automated Data Processing Equipment (ADPE), software, and
   related computer services.
   1.6. Other related electronic systems and equipment.
2. IT Board/Working Group & Change Control Board.
   2.1. The 56 FW IT Board, Working Group and Change Control Board (CCB) were
   established to ensure the continued availability of wing-level planning forums to review
   current and future IT issues affecting Luke AFB’s C4 infrastructure and the respective
   systems supported. The IT Board, in close coordination with the IT Working Group and
   CCB, ensures participative organizational planning, sharing of IT resources, and exploits
   related synergies when feasible and cost effective. Both forums are used as catalysts to
   promote a centralized, proactive, wing-wide focus to address pertinent IT issues and
   concerns. The IT Board is chaired by 56 FW/CC. Membership consists of 56 OG/CC, 56
   MXG/CC, 56 MSG/CC, 56 MDG/CC, 56 FW/RMO, and 944 FW/CC. The 56 CS/CC, as the
   wing CSO, serves as technical advisor to the IT Board. The IT Working Group consists of
   functional representatives from each of the groups and other functional areas as required.
   The IT Board typically convenes quarterly, while the IT Working Group convenes as
   required. The CCB is chaired by the 56 CS/CC and consists of subject matter experts from
   each functional area within 56 CS. As necessary, Group representatives and other functional
   areas are invited to attend the CCB, though they will not be voting members in the
   fundamental decision making process.
3. General Requirements Processing Information.
   3.1. The wing CSO provides an approved technical solution/broad gauge costing, and the
   customer typically funds the requirement. Unit commanders must ensure only valid and
   necessary C&I systems requirements are submitted and technical solutions are reviewed and
   approved. Except for routine telephone requirements, which may be delegated to unit
   Telephone Control Officers (TCOs), unit commanders are designated as the approval
   authority for their respective units.
4. Requirements Processing Procedures.
   4.1. The requesting organization identifies C&I systems requirements using E-3215,
   Communications and Information Systems Requirement Request, and allocates resources to
   satisfy     those       requirements.       The    E-3215     is      available     at
   https://luke.eis.aetc.af.mil/56MSG/CS/SCX/SCXP/C%20%20I%20Systems%20Require

    forwarded through respective unit commanders to 56 CS/SCOSC for a technical
    solution/broad gauge costing and subsequent implementation.             Anyone within an
    organization can submit a C&I requirement except as specified in paras 4.1. through 4.5.
    4.2. Software requirements.
       4.2.1. Software requirements must be submitted by the applicable unit’s Software
       License Manager (SLM). For software that is not listed on the AF Evaluated/Approved
       Products List (E/APL) or the transitional list, additional supporting documentation must
       be submitted using the current Application Request Worksheet (ARW)
       <https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/DocView.asp?DocID=9736561> . The ARW must also be
       digitally signed by an IAM or higher. In this case, your request shall be submitted to the
       Air Force Network Integration Center for further processing and authorization prior to
       being     submitted     locally.      The      AF     E/APL     can     be   found      at:
       https://cs.eis.af.mil/afdaa/Lists/COTSGOTS%20Software/EPL.aspx.
    4.3. Personnel Wireless Communications Systems (PWCS) requirements.
       4.3.1. PWCS requirements, to include hand-held mobile radios, pagers, and cellular
       telephones, must be submitted by the applicable unit’s PWCS Manager. IAW AFI 33-
       106, the unit PWCS Manager is required to submit a decision matrix (Attachment 2) prior
       to initiating a C&I requirement.
    4.4. Office/building renovation or relocation requirements.
       4.4.1. Office/building renovation or relocation requirements will include coordination
       with the unit’s applicable TCO to ensure telephone and network requirements are both
       addressed.
    4.5. Functional users.
       4.5.1. Functional users can route requests for electronic equipment directly to the
       command functional, but must coordinate with 56 CS/SCXP for base communications
       infrastructure support.
    4.6. C&I requirement requests.
       4.6.1. C&I requirement requests are not required for Automated Data Processing
       Equipment (ADPE) that meets the AETC standard (workstations and laptop computers to
       include monitors, printers, scanners, and docking stations). Equipment Custodians (ECs)
       will purchase via AFWay and as part of the AETC Quarterly Enterprise Buy. For out-of-
       cycle or non-standard ADPE requirements, the EC must prepare a waiver IAW governing
       guidelines as outlined in the Luke C4 Catalog. Contact ADPE representatives at 6-7673
       for further instructions. 944 FW personnel contact 944 FSS/SCO at 6-8025 for assistance
       with ADPE matters.
    4.7. Contract operations.
       4.7.1. If the requirement supports contract operations, the Air Force Contracting
       Officer's name and telephone number must be included in the justification block.
    4.8. C&I system requirements.
LUKEAFBI33-103 3 DECEMBER 2013                                                                5


     4.8.1. C&I system requirements will be submitted using the Luke Air Force Base
     SharePoint Site at https://luke.eis.aetc.af.mil/default.aspx by clicking the
     “Communications and Information Systems Requirements Request” link. Requirements
     will not be accepted, and may be delayed, without all necessary fields completed or
     if not submitted by appropriate personnel/authority.
  4.9. Official CATV requirements.
     4.9.1. Official CATV requirements (official use; typically Group commanders and
     above, billeting facilities and/or 24-hour operations) will be submitted per para 4.7.
     above.
     4.9.2. Unofficial CATV requirements do not require submission of an e-3215.
     Unofficial CATV requirements will be funded at the unit level to include installation and
     recurring charges using the GPC card.
  4.10. Requesting organizations.
     4.10.1. Requesting organizations typically fund all telephone requirements to include
     cellular telephones and personal digital assistants (PDA; i.e., BlackBerry, etc.) and local
     area network (LAN) wiring requests. Major C&I systems, large equipment purchases,
     substantial LAN wiring, fiber optic cabling, paging systems, call management systems,
     and voice mail systems are typically forwarded to the requesting organization or placed
     in the Luke C4 Blueprint for funding of the technical solution.
  4.11. 56 CS/SCOSC.
     4.11.1. 56 CS/SCOSC assigns a control number for tracking purposes, coordinates with
     the customer, obtains an initial technical solution/broad gauge costing, and forwards it to
     the requesting organization, typically within 45 days of receipt.
     4.11.2. The requesting organization must review and approve the technical solution, and
     provide necessary funds and other resources as required to begin implementation. The
     user or originator may cancel the requirement at any time by submitting a written request
     to 56 CS/SCOSC at Luke.helpdesk@us.af.mil.
     4.11.3. The implementation strategy will be one of the following or a combination
     thereof:
         4.11.3.1. The requesting organization will procure the material identified in the
         technical solution and costing and 56 CS will install.
         4.11.3.2. The requesting organization will procure and install the materials identified
         in the technical solution and costing either through organic or contractor resources.
     4.11.4. 56 CS/SCOSC will:
         4.11.4.1. Route applicable requirements through unit organic resources to include the
         56 CS/SCOKR (Base Records Management) for legal requirements related to
         automated records, Privacy Act, or Freedom of Information Act issues; 56 CS/SCXS
         (Base Information Assurance) for requirements related to COMSEC equipment; 56
         FW/PA (Base Multimedia Manager) on requirements related to Multimedia Systems;
         and 56 CS/SCXP as applicable.
 6                                                     LUKEAFBI33-103 3 DECEMBER 2013


           4.11.4.2. Obtain technical solution/broad gauge costing using organic resources.
           When the development of the technical solution exceeds the capability of organic
           resources, 56 CS/SCOSC will obtain wing CSO validation of the requirement and
           forward the requirement to 56 CS/SCXP for contractor, Cyber Systems Integrator
           (CSI-B), or other non-organic engineering support to assist with preparation of the
           technical solution.      In addition, 56 CS/SCOSC will forward the following
           requirements to 56 CS/SCXP for submittal to the AETC/A6 Requirements Manager
           as outlined in the attached instructions:
           4.11.4.3. Requirements exceeding $250K in a FY or $1M over the FYDP.
           4.11.4.4. Non-Standard IT Peripherals, i.e., IT equipment not available from AFWay
           or any USAF Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA).
           4.11.4.5. Long-haul circuits.
           4.11.4.6. Video teleconferencing and multimedia equipment.
           4.11.4.7. Secret Internet Protocol Routing Network (SIPRNet) requirements.
           4.11.4.8. Engineering and Installation (E&I) out of cycle requirements.
           4.11.4.9. Requirements with the potential to be used by, or affect more than one base.
           4.11.4.10. Requirements for Automated Information.
Note: Prior to submission to the AETC/A6 RM, requirements must be validated by at least an O-6 in
the submitters chain-of-command, and all requirements must be endorsed by the CSO (56 CS/CC)
stating the requirement is a valid mission need or deficiency. Wing users with requirements for any
of the above shall continue to follow the local base CS process for requirements submission. The CS
will forward the requirement to the AETC/A6 Requirements Manager (RM). This new guidance is
intended to bring an AETC enterprise approach to the IT requirements process. This will guide the
command to confidently and securely incorporate these new capabilities into the existing
environments.
           4.11.4.11. Coordinate with 56 CS/SCXP as required to ensure the technical solution
           satisfies all technical architecture as referenced in paragraph 1. The technical
           solution will usually be forwarded to the unit commander within 10 calendar days of
           receipt.
           4.11.4.12. Most technical solutions/broad gauge costings are valid for a maximum of
           4 months, while some are good for only 30-60 days from the date completed. Upon
           expiration of those costings and where requirement implementation is dependent on
           56 CS, the customer will be advised and the requirement will be placed in a held-in-
           abeyance (HIA) status awaiting customer funding/resubmission.
           4.11.4.13. Typically, individual, stand-alone requirements, will be the individual
           unit’s responsibility to fund.          Requirements that impact overall base
           infrastructure/architecture or impact overall mission accomplishment will be added to
           the base C4 Systems Blueprint. By adding requirements to the Blueprint, they are
           linked to the funds programming process to facilitate MAJCOM and Lead Command
           Program Objective Memorandum submissions.
LUKEAFBI33-103 3 DECEMBER 2013                                                                 7


           4.11.4.14. Requirements will be closed when no longer valid or once no further
           support is required of 56 CS.
   4.12. 56 CS/SCXP will:
       4.12.1. Track/monitor requirements forwarded to AETC/A6 RM.
       4.12.2. Obtain technical solutions to requirements that exceed the capability of organic
       resources.
       4.12.3. Add requirements to the C4 Blueprint for funding consideration as applicable.
       4.12.4. Upon establishment of a project, utilize the CIPS dashboard for management.
5. Luke Change Control Board.
   5.1. The purpose of the Luke Change Control Board (CCB) is to ensure all new or modified
   systems are compliant with the present technical infrastructure to ensure a seamless
   integration onto the Luke Network. The CCB will validate new systems and system
   configuration changes can be accomplished in such a manner, as to not degrade the operation
   of the Luke Network or its supporting systems. The CCB is the single point of management
   responsibility for change management decisions related to the configuration and evolutionary
   development of the Luke Network. The CCB has approval authority for changes to the
   configuration baseline, including (but not limited to) the following entities: software,
   hardware, COTS products, and documentation defining the current configuration. The CCB
   process is defined by wing charter and identifies the CCB role in executing the configuration
   change management process. It also provides the details of CCB operations including CCB
   membership, activities, responsibilities and operating procedures.
6. Luke Change Control Board Procedures.
   6.1. Any change to the configuration baseline must be managed using the configuration
   change management process, and must be approved by the CCB. The CCB manages changes
   to the configuration baselines by using the E-3215 process, and/or any other subsequent
   requirements document. To perform its review, the CCB requires input from the members of
   the CCB. The output of the CCB review is a decision on whether or not to authorize initiation
   of the change. For those changes which are approved, the CCB will also prioritize the
   changes to indicate a preferred or desired sequence in which the changes shall be
   implemented. The CCB will meet periodically, as determined by the Chairperson (or
   designated alternate).
7. Responsibilities.
   7.1. Wing Commander will:
       7.1.1. Serve as the base-level approval authority for the base C4 Systems Blueprint, other

     8.4.1. The agency responsible for the construction activity will ensure all personnel
     actually performing work take adequate precautionary steps by following the rules and
     comments made on the AF Form 103 by both Civil Engineering and the Luke AFB
     resident telephone services contractor. Contractors may be held liable for damage done,
     with or without an AF Form 103, by the commercial utility company or AF if damage is
     within 2 feet of the centerline of the staked area. Due diligence, according to state law
     and AF guidelines, must be adhered to by contractor personnel at all times.
