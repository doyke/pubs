1. General: A unit must coordinate all ammunition or explosives procedures with the 436 AW Chief of
Safety and Weapons Safety Manager/NCOIC before final action by the approval authority (Squadron
commander or equivalent). The Weapons Safety Program must be equally shared by the host and tenant
units and supported by all levels of management to be effective. Apply the program by:
    1.1. Coordinating between host and tenant representatives in explosives and hazardous material oper-
    ations.
    1.2. Enforcing and complying with safety instructions/regulations and standards, and applying safety
    engineering principles.
    1.3. Inspecting explosives, operations, and facilities, and investigating mishaps and incidents.
    1.4. Identifying hazards and developing corrective measures.
    1.5. Using technically qualified explosives personnel and correct use of equipment.
    1.6. Adequately training personnel on a frequent and continuing basis.
    1.7. Unit Responsibilities: All units will comply with established procedures. Personnel responsible
    for handling, storing, assembling, maintaining, testing, transporting, or using explosives will make
    sure that:
       1.7.1. Ammunition, explosives or items containing explosives are not taken into or stored in any
       office or building not licensed/cited for that use.
       1.7.2. They brief operating personnel in detail with safety directives, technical orders, operating
       instructions and other publications to ensure a safe and efficient operation.
    1.8. Explosives Truck Routes:
       1.8.1. Primary Route: All vehicles containing DOT Class A or B (1.1, 1.2, 1.3) explosives will
       enter and exit the base through Gate 5. Vehicle movement is restricted to the roads from Gate 5 to
       the explosives storage facilities. Gate 5 is located east of ZONE II and is for the sole use of explo-
       sives loaded vehicles.
       1.8.2. Alternate Route: If the primary truck route becomes unusable, use Gate 4 (South Gate) and
       follow Arnold Drive and Reno Street to the explosives storage facility. The 436th Aerial Port
       Squadron (436 APS) will provide a lead vehicle. In the event the 436 APS cannot provide a lead
       vehicle, request assistance from 436th Security Forces Squadron (436 SFS) IAW DAFBI 91-204,
       Reception of Hazardous/Sensitive Cargo.
       1.8.3. Flight line/Internal Base Routes: All explosives loaded vehicles will follow the explosives
       routes. (See Attachment 2).
           1.8.3.1. The movement of explosives between licensed explosives facilities over internal base
           explosives routes is limited to 50 pounds NEW, C/D 1.3 and unlimited quantities C/D 1.4.
           Exception: Mission-essential requirements may deviate from the explosives routes, but avoid
           all highly populated areas and mission-oriented facilities.
           1.8.3.2. Each vehicle transporting explosives on base must have appropriate placards and fire
           extinguishers as required by AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards. Exception: Vehi-
           cles transporting HC/D 1.4 on base only, do not require placards.

      these publications. For units and squadrons having a custodial ammunition account, coordinate
      with Munitions Accountable Systems Officer (MASO), 436 MXS/MXMW. Develop and coordi-
      nate these directives, with proper approval, before beginning any operation. Process changes in
      the same manner as the original directive. In all instances, the 436 AW/SE is the final approving
      authority. Send one copy of the approved procedures, AF Form 673, and the current index to 436
      AW/SE.
      2.2.6. Ensure operating personnel periodically review unit operating instructions on the handling,
