SUBJECT: Air Force Guidance Memorandum to AFI 36-2646, Security Forces Training and
         Standardization Evaluation Programs, 13 Apr 2012, Home Station Training
         Initiative

Releasability: There are no releasability restrictions on this publication.

By Order of the Secretary of the Air Force, this Air Force Guidance Memorandum immediately
changes AFI 36-2646, Security Forces Training and Standardization Evaluation Programs, 13
Apr 2012. Compliance with this Memorandum is mandatory to included Air National Guard
(ANG) and Air Force Reserve (AFR) units. To the extent its directions are inconsistent with
other Air Force Publications, the information herein prevails, in accordance with AFI 33-360,
Publications and Forms Management. This guidance is effective upon receipt and will be
incorporated into AFI 36-2646 rewrite. The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in
this publication are identified with a Tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number following the
compliance statement. See AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, for a description
of the authorities associated with the Tier numbers. Submit requests for waivers through the
chain of command to the appropriate Tier waiver approval authority, or alternatively, to the
Publication OPR for non-tiered compliance items.

    The guidance in AFI 36-2646 is hereby changed as follows:

Home Station Training (HST) Objective. The new HST initiative is non-post associated training
designed to provide a career field training strategy. The initiative allows MAJCOMs and units
the ability to right size training to meet local mission requirements associated with Mission
Essential Tasks (METs), Mission Essential Task Lists (METL) and UTC obligations. HST links
directly to the unit’s Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) reporting and the
Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS). In addition, HST establishes a standard baseline
of training which ensures AF/A7S’ global delivery of a standardized, tactically proficient and
resilient defender, regardless of MAJCOM, mission, or location.




                                                   
Unit Training Obligation. Active Duty, Department of Air Force Civilian Police/Security
Guards (DAF CP/SG) 0083/0085, and full time Air Reserve Component (ARC) personnel will
complete 216 hours/27 days of training (DOT) of HST annually. (T-1). HAF directs 108 hours
of training through the Foundational Skills Library and MAJCOMs or if delegated to the unit
DFCs, select the remaining 108 hours from the remaining Libraries in the SF HST Course
Catalog. IMA’s and Non-full time Category A (unit) ARC will complete 151 hours/21 DOT of
HST in a 21 month cycle directly linked to AEF cycle. (T-1). IMA’s and Non-full time Category
A (unit) ARC on extended orders 90 days or more will assume the Active Duty HST
requirements listed above. (T-1) ARC training consists of Foundational Skills Library (FSL),
Combat Readiness Training (CRT), and AF Tier 2B training. Note: Training times identified
are for force management and planning purposes only. Security Forces are required to be trained
to standard not to a specific time.

Individual Training Obligation. Although it is desirable all individuals be trained to the same
tactical level, unless otherwise identified by higher level guidance, HST applies only to: DW
coded personnel, flight personnel, and all unit support personnel, E-6s/O-2s and below and
equivalent DAF CP/SG (in accordance with Position Description and IAW AFI 31-122,
Department of the Air Force Civilian Police/Security Guard Program). All others must be
knowledgeable of the operational employment of these forces commensurate with duty position.
(T-1). Note: Units should avoid overtime to the greatest extent possible and adhere to local
Civilian Overtime Policies.

Credit for SF Sustainment and Pre-Deployment Training. An individual’s completion of SF
Sustainment and Pre-Deployment Training will be credited towards the 108 hours of MAJCOM
or DFC training through the Expeditionary Skill Library (ESL). (T-1). These individuals are
required to complete the FSL (HAF Mandated 108 hours) and CRT 90 days prior to vulnerability
window.

Personnel Returning from Deployments. Unless otherwise determined by the MAJCOM,
individuals returning from deployments will fall into the unit’s annual training cycle upon return
to duty status. (T-1). These individuals are not required to execute the portions of the annual
training plan already completed while they were in deployed or reconstitution status.

Unit Orientation Training. Unless otherwise determined by the MAJCOM, there are no specified
AF/A7S orientation training requirements (Nuclear units will have to evaluate for possible
additional orientation requirements). (T-2). Instead, units will utilize orientation training to bring
newly assigned personnel in line with the unit’s annual training cycle and to execute necessary
Unit Training Manager (UTM) and local administrative processes. (T-3). During orientation
training, personnel will be evaluated on training which they received a GO at their previous duty
station and which occurred during the gaining unit's current training cycle. (T-3). If properly
documented and the member still meets the established training standards then they will not be
required to re-accomplish the previously conducted training and no further documentation is
required. (T-3).

Mission Needs Analysis (MNA). A MNA must to be conducted to determine the DFC’s mission
responsibilities and establish the foundation for the unit’s annual training plan. (T-2). Elements
required to complete the MNA are: Designed Operational Capability (DOC) Statement, METs
& METLs obligations (DFC determined with MAJCOM approval), projected UTC obligations
(DW Coded members), Post Priority Chart and special certifications and qualifications.

Annual Training Plan. Requirements identified by the MNA coupled with the MAJCOM or
DFC desired advanced skills or proficiencies will be aligned against the unit’s training
obligations and SF HST Course Catalog to build the unit’s annual training plan. Note. The
annual training plan must be staffed to owning MAJCOMs for approval.

Aligning Forces Against the Annual Training Plan. Each work center (S-1, S-2, S-3, S-4 and S-
5) will further breakdown the annual training plan to align members to required, training,
certifications and qualifications not applicable to all, to develop their work center Master Task
List (MTL). (T-3). Once completed, use the information from the MNA and the annual training
plan to build the Master Training Plan (MTP) selecting topics from the SF HST Course Catalog
only.

Training Delivery. Leader-led training is the preferred delivery method for all SF training.
Trainers, whether S3T or designated flight trainers will use evaluate, train, evaluate (ETE) to
ensure each member is trained to standard commensurate with rank and duty position. (T-3).
This approach ensures members are proficient in the identified task, by first
evaluating/identifying weak areas and in turn, train those areas to a desired level of proficiency.
Under ETE, individuals, teams and flights will not require additional training if they meet the
required performance standard in an area identified in the MNA and codified in the annual
training plan. (T-3). This method further ensures training resources are effectively focused on
areas requiring greater level of time and resources.

Documentation. Available Task Performance Checklist (TPC) located in the electronic-Tactics,
Techniques and Procedures Guides (e-TTPG) will be used to evaluate members on a GO/NO GO
performance standard. (T-1). Once the member receives a GO, the date of the completion of this
task will be added to the applicable block of the AF Form 1098 in the member’s Air Force
Training Record (AFTR) and an entry will be made in the 623A. (T-1). Any topics waived or
exempted from the unit’s annual training plan will be documented in the members 623A under
the specific training module. (T-3).

Authorized Reference Material. To ensure standardization of training across the Air Force, units
are only authorized to utilize the training material identified in the SF HST Course Catalog.
Trainers will use available e-TTPG and HST reference material located on the HQ AFSFC
website at: https://afsfmil.lackland.af.mil/sfot-training.html to ETE. (T-1). However, during the
implementation of this initiative, there will be some sub topics in certain modules where a valid
reference is not available. In these instances, units are exempt from the topic (not the module)
until the HQ AFSFC can provide the appropriate reference. (T-3). For unit level planning
purposes, if a topic reference is added after the DFC signs the annual training plan then the unit
is not required to update the annual training plan until the following scheduled publication date
(not to exceed 12 months) and will remain exempt during this duration of time. (T-3).
Implementation of SF HST Course Catalog. All HST training will be selected from the SF HST
Course Catalog. (T-1). The SF HST Course located on the HQ AFSFC website at:
https://afsfmil.lackland.af.mil/sfot-training.html. The SF HST Course Catalog is grouped into six
distinctive Libraries linked directly to AF/A7S’ MET obligations or SF Skills. The MET
Libraries include: Law and Order Operations (L&OL), Nuclear Security (NSL) and Military
Working Dog (MWDL). The SF Skills Libraries include: SF Foundational Skills (FSL), SF
Expeditionary Skills (ESL) and Advanced Individual/Team Skills and Proficiency (ASL). Note.
The MWDL is intended to capture MWD training requirements but is not part of the individuals
216 hour training requirement.

Execution of FSL. Completion of the entire FSL will be accomplished by all SF regardless of
MET, mission or location and will be included in their annual training plan, unless waivered by
the Career Field Manager (CFM). (T-1).

Module Use. With the exception of the ASL, the HST is delivered using modules. Modules are a
collection of training topics intended to be delivered collectively to achieve a specific “tactical
level effect”. Units will select the modules from the appropriate libraries which meet mission
needs. (T-1). Although units are not required to complete the entire library (exception FSL and
NSL) they are required to train the entire module selected unless the topic is identified as
exemptible by HQ AFSFC. (T-1) When making module selection considerations must be given
to ensure units meet all L&O requirements IAW DoDI 5525.15. Law Enforcement (LE)
Standards and Training in the DoD. (T-1).

Training Commensurate with Rank and Duty Position (Tiering). With the understanding Airmen
are required to perform at different levels, the HST uses a Tiered approach. Items identified with
an “*” in the SF HST Course Catalog are not required to be performed by E-3s and below unless
determined by the MAJCOM or DFC.

Training Commensurate with Local Mission. Units are also allowed to exempt themselves from
specific training topics (without seeking waiver approval) in any module identified with an “L”
in the SF HST Course Catalog, if the specific line item falls outside of the of unit’s mission
obligations (Example, Exclusive Jurisdiction Considerations in the Traffic Enforcement Module
of the L&OL would not be required if the installation does not have exclusive jurisdiction).

Application of the ASL. The ASL is delivered topically and is intended to allow the DFC to
leverage HST to take credit for required specialized certifications (i.e. Radar, Breathalyzer) and
qualifications (i.e. special weapons, additional non-lethal weapons). Additionally, the ASL
allows the DFC to invest more training time in a specific capability already covered in other
libraries (i.e. SF Tactical Maneuver, Conduct Physical Control of Subjects/Suspects, Weapon
Proficiency) to enhance unit capabilities commensurate with the MAJCOM’s or DFC’s desired
level of proficiency. When using the ASL to enhance capabilities beyond what is delivered in
previously covered modules, units may opt to use a topical approach (versus re-accomplishing
the entire module), selecting and focusing on a specific line item from a previously trained
module (Example, Selecting the Combatives line item from the Conduct Physical Control of
Subjects Module). However, this is additive training and not conducted in lieu of any module
from the FSL. Lastly, the ASL allows MAJCOMs and DFCs to take advantage of civilian, state,
local or federal professional training venues to enhance unit capabilities (Example, interrogation
techniques or ForcePRO) and the time attending these course can be applied to the MAJCOM’s
or unit’s 108 hours. In addition, intra-service and joint training venues not designated as
Professional Military Education or skill level awarding venues can also be applied to the
individual’s annual training obligation (Examples. ESS Course, MPI, IDC3).

Approval for Topics not Captured in ASL. Although not all inclusive, the ASL does capture
some of these training opportunities available to use against a MAJCOM’s or unit’s 108 hours of
training. If a unit wishes to take advantage of professional training venues not identified in the
ASL they only need to seek MAJCOM approval of the venue and the respective MAJCOM will
forward the topic to AFSFC/SFOT for immediate inclusion in the ASL. Note: This only applies
to the ASL.

Deviation/Wavier Process. DFCs will provide written justification utilizing the AF FM 116,
Request for Deviation from Security Criteria to the parent MAJCOM/A7S. (T-2). In the AF FM
116, DFCs will capture the validation for the specific training topic waived and compensatory
measures to deliver the commensurate tactical effect covered through the waived topic. If the
parent MAJCOM/A7S concurs, the request will be forwarded to HQ AFSFC for coordination
with SF CFM for final approval.

Execution of CRT. Individuals required to conduct CRT will utilize the CRT Module located in
the ESL. (T-1).

memorandum, or upon incorporation by Interim Change to, or rewrite of AFI 36-2646,
whichever is earlier. HQ AFSFC/SFOT POC is Major Dana Metzger, DSN: 945-5157,

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This Interim Change (IC) incorporates new guidance from AFI 36-2646_AFGM2, which updates
the HQ AFSFC website that incorporates the Instructor Evaluation Checklist, a listing of Home
Station Training (HST), Ancillary Training, and the training subject listing and frequency. An
addition was added in reference to the DFCs’ compliance with Public Affairs responsibilities and
management. Chapter 4, paragraph 4.2., was revised to update information regarding Unit Laser
Safety Officer. Paragraph 4.3. was substantially revised to provide supplementary guidance and
clarify who must complete Combat Readiness Training (CRT) and when, as well as revised to
make clarifications to the weapons test. An addition was added to paragraph 4.3. in reference to
the authorized databases that can be used to document training. Chapter 5, paragraph 5.4.3., was
revised to update information regarding Duty Position Evaluations (verbal and performance)
involving weapons. Chapter 6, paragraph 6.3., was changed for purposes of readability and
clarification. The IC identifies Tier waiver authorities as approved by the Inspector General
Advisory Board (IGAB). When a requirement is mandated for compliance at the Wing level
throughout this IC, the requirement is tiered, signifying the appropriate waiver authority to the
requirement and is indicated in parentheses (T-0, T-1, T-2, or T-3) following the

                         SECURITY FORCES TRAINING PROGRAM

2.1. SF Training Program Objective. The objective of the SF Training Program is to build
aggressive, lethal, highly-maneuverable, air-minded, capabilities-based and combat-focused
defenders. Trained defenders will possess enhanced individual and collective skills that run the
gamut from law enforcement and security operations to high-order infantry type skills that
ensure delivery of ID desired effects and mission success.
2.2. SF Training Program Description. The SF Training Program encompasses Home Station
Training (HST), Expeditionary Skills Training (EST) and Formal Training. The program ensures
the execution of all required individual and collective skills needed to build, reinforce and
sustain SFs ability to deliver enduring ID against threats to Air Force, Joint and Coalition
missions.
     2.2.1. SF training programs must be rooted in the evaluate-train-evaluate methodology.
     Evaluate-train-evaluate ensures members are proficient in the identified task, by first
     evaluating, identifying weak areas, and in turn, training those areas to a level of proficiency.
     Under this methodology, an individual or team will not require additional training if they
     have proven proficiency in a given task. This method ensures training resources are
     effectively used.
2.3. Responsibilities. SF at every level have an inherent responsibility to ensure personnel
under their command or supervision are adequately trained and maintain proficiency in their
mission essential tasks (MET). SF leaders must assume roles as teachers and small unit leaders,
responsible for every aspect of an Airman’s development, to include the delivery of recurring
training. Leader-led training is the primary delivery method for all SF standardized recurring
training. Individuals conducting leader-led training are not required to attend Principles of
Instruction, the Air University (AU) Online Instructor Methodology Course 1.2 (Course Number
03S00W), or a MAJCOM-approved Instructor Course. However, SF conducting leader- led
training should, at a minimum, be familiar with training responsibilities outlined in AFI 36-2201,
Air Force Training Program, and have attended the Air Force Trainer’s Course. Tier III level
courses of instruction may be taught by leader-led instructors, but will be certified by personnel
who have completed instructor methodology as outlined in AFI 36-2201 and this instruction,
which includes certification through Principles of Instruction, the Air University (AU) Online
Instructor Methodology Course 1.2 (Course Number 03S00W), or a MAJCOM- approved

     3.3.3.5. MAJCOM/A1 will be the final approval authority for any issues regarding quota
     funding.
  3.3.4. Mission Readiness Training Allocations.
     3.3.4.1. 343 TRS identifies SF requirements built for all MAJCOMs and allocates
     MAJCOM quotas.
     3.3.4.2. Once all allocations are loaded in OTA, MAJCOM SF Training Managers export
     the data. MAJCOMs must determine how to allocate quotas to units based upon MRT
     data call and quotas received.
     3.3.4.3. The MRTP funded baseline set by Second Air Force (2 AF) determines the
     number of funded quotas available.
     3.3.4.4. MAJCOMs who have not executed funded quotas in the past (i.e., 20 quotas
     requested and only 10 executed), could affect future quotas received.
     3.3.4.5. Zeroing of requirements may occur if allocations from previous FYs were not
     filled;
     30 days prior for Air Force courses or 60 days prior for sister service courses.
  3.3.5. Priority Explanation.
     3.3.5.1. When submitting MRTP validations, each requirement must have a priority
     designated.
         3.3.5.1.1. Priority 1 are Mission Critical requirements: the mission will fail without
         this training. All “T” quota type requests must be submitted under Priority 1; any
         under priority 2 will be zeroed out. “P” quota types may also be loaded under Priority
         1 if unit or MAJCOM will fund the course.
         3.3.5.1.2. Priority 2 are Mission Essential requirements: the mission will not fail, but
         the training would greatly assist in accomplishing the mission. All Priority 2 quotas
         should be submitted as a “P” quota type.
     3.3.5.2. Distance learning and Mobile Training Team classes type 4, 6 or 7 (look at the
     second digit in the course number (e.g., J7AZTTXXXX 0P1A)), do not count against a
     MAJCOM’s funded baseline. “T” quotas cannot be built under these classes.
  3.3.6. Allocations in Non-SF Functional Courses.
     3.3.6.1. All formal courses are managed by a course owner. Other AFSCs requiring
     training in SF allocated training will seek these courses via their MAJCOM SF Training
     Manager. Similarly, MAJCOM SF Training Managers will also seek training venues
     through other MAJCOM Course Functional Managers.
AFI36-2646 13 APRIL 2012                                                                     15


      3.3.6.2. Based upon MAJCOMs’ FY training requirements, contact Course Functional
      Managers for the required courses to request allocations. Most Course Functional
      Managers can be determined through ETCA website instructions.
   3.3.7. Non-Mission Readiness Training Allocations.
      3.3.7.1. In addition to the standard SF formal training courses, there are numerous other
      training venues available which enhance overall unit capabilities and skill sets. Most of
      these courses can be identified using the ETCA website to search for courses.
      3.3.7.2. MAJCOM Training Managers schedule Non-MRT courses either directly
      through the course owner, or by having requirements built and requesting allocations in a
      course from the course owner.
          3.3.7.2.1. When requesting allocations in a Non-MRT course that is not directly
          scheduled by the course owner, submit the course and quota information to the
          MAJCOM/A1 to request requirements be built in OTA. Once requirements are built,
          the course owner can release allocations to the TRQI and courses can be scheduled
          through AFPC as outlined below.
      3.3.7.3. The majority of pre-deployment training does not process through formal
      training channels with the exception of Air Mobility Command (AMC) courses. All
      AMC courses, to include RTCs, are scheduled through the MAJCOM SF Training
      Manager after requesting allocations from the AMC course owner.
3.4. Scheduling.
   3.4.1. Formal training classes for upgrade training, cross training and Professional Military
   Education are processed through the base level formal training offices. The majority of all
   other formal training is requested by S-3/Training through the MAJCOM SF Training
   Manager.
   3.4.2. Units will submit formal training requests for FY allocations to the MAJCOM SF
   Training Manager.
   3.4.3. When additional allocations are required, the unit may seek quotas using the “out of
   cycle” process.
      3.4.3.1. Formal training classes have a “use or lose” date, usually within 30 days of the
      class start date for Air Force courses and 60 days for sister service courses. Units not
      filling allocations prior to “use or lose” date risk losing training allocations.
   3.4.4. Units may request a quota movement to change quota status.
      3.4.4.1. Change a quota status from officer, enlisted or civilian by submitting a quota
      movement request. For example, request an “AP” quota be changed to an “OP” quota. If
      approved, the quota will change from an enlisted “A” quota to officer “O” quota.
      3.4.4.2. Request funding for a course by submitting a quota movement request for
      funding. For example, request an “AP” quota be changed to an “AT” quota. If approved,
      the quota will be changed from a Unit/MAJCOM funded “P” quota to a fully funded “T”
      quota.
      3.4.4.3. Funding availability is determined by 2 AF/MRTP.
 16                                                             AFI36-2646 13 APRIL 2012


   3.4.5. Prior to submitting training requests, units must ensure members meet eligibility
   requirements as outlined in the ETCA website.
      3.4.5.1. Students not meeting course prerequisites will not be submitted for training
      unless the ETCA website prerequisite waiver process is followed (if one is listed), or the
      MAJCOM Training Manager works directly with the formal training course Point of
      Contact (POC) to approve the eligibility discrepancy.
      3.4.5.2. Grade waivers must be submitted to the 343 TRS Training Manager (through the
      respective MAJCOM/A7S) for SF functional courses.
      3.4.5.3. Members reporting to school without a valid Training Line Number (TLN) or
      without meeting prerequisites may be returned to home-station without attending training
      and the parent organization will incur any/all associated costs.
   3.4.6. MAJCOMs submit training requests to the AFPC/DPSIT team to which they are
   assigned, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, etc.
   3.4.7. Once processed, the MAJCOM provides units the TLN for each student.
   3.4.8. A Report on Individual Personnel (RIP) will be generated from the Base Formal
   Training Office. UTMs will provide students reporting instructions, as outlined in the ETCA
   website, prior to departing for TDY.
3.5. Course Replacements/Cancellations/Swaps.
   3.5.1. The unit will submit replacements, cancellations or swaps to the MAJCOM/A7S for
   processing using current AFPC format and template.
   3.5.2. Failure to submit replacements, cancellations or swaps in a timely manner may result
   in loss of training quotas. Units must effectively monitor and execute training quotas to
   ensure minimal loss of training. Unfilled training quotas ultimately affect the entire SF
   community by denying other defenders training opportunities.
   3.5.3. Students not attending scheduled training will be marked as a no-show. Parent
   organizations will incur any/all associated costs for student no-shows.
      3.5.3.1. UTM will provide justification for no-show to the MAJCOM Training Manager
      before the student can be rescheduled.
3.6. Formal Training Resources
   3.6.1. SF Center of Training Excellence website (SF CTE). The SF CTE website provides
   SF members a single portal for access to various training programs, resources and tools. The
   SF CTE is found at https://sf-cte.csd.disa.mil/kc/login/login.asp.
   3.6.2. ETCA Website. The ETCA website is operated by AETC; it contains a list of training
   courses conducted or managed by MAJCOMs or Field Operating Agencies (FOA). It also
   lists courses conducted or administered by the Air Force and reserve forces and serves as a
   reference for the Air Force, DoD, other military services, government agencies and security
   assistance programs.
AFI36-2646 13 APRIL 2012                                                                     17


     3.6.2.1. Information such as course reporting instructions, prerequisites and uniform and
     security requirements can be found in the ETCA website. Certain types of courses,
     especially those that are unique or conducted on a one-time basis, are not listed in the
     ETCA website.
     NOTE: Additional courses not listed on the SF CTE can be searched for on the ETCA
     website by using the search tab. Search for courses using the course number or keyword.
  3.6.3. Air Force Officer Classification Directory/Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory.
  These separate directories contain the official specialty descriptions for all military
  classification codes and identifies each Air Force job and the minimum mandatory
  qualifications of personnel to fill these jobs. These standards are used to develop career
  programs for initial training, retraining, and skill upgrade. Special Experience Identifiers
  (SEI) are also located in these directories and can be found on the AFPC website.

  4.2.5. Supervisor /Work Center Supervisor.
     4.2.5.1. Supervisors are key to trainee and mission success. They must share their
     experiences and expertise by providing a quality training program that ensures
     subordinates attain and maintain proficiency in required tasks. Supervisors plan, conduct
     and evaluate training. It is vital that all supervisors know their responsibilities outlined in
     AFI 36-2201.
     4.2.5.2. Per AFI 36-2201, the work center supervisor identifies and executes specific
     training requirements for each duty position within their work center as reflected in the
     work center MTL.
         4.2.5.2.1. In addition to executing supervisor responsibilities IAW AFI 36-2201,
         supervisors must:
         4.2.5.2.2. Review assigned personnel’s AFTR to determine training requirements and
         ensure all necessary training is accomplished per the duty position or work center
         MTL.

      4.2.8.1. Executes trainee responsibilities IAW AFI 36-2201.
      4.2.8.2. Obtains and maintains the knowledge and skills necessary to perform assigned
      tasks.
      4.2.8.3. Completes surveys (Graduate Assessment Surveys and Field Evaluation
      Questionnaires) IAW AFI 36-2201.
4.3. SF Home Station Training Program Elements.
   4.3.1. Individual Skills Training teaches initial knowledge/skills or sustains existing
   knowledge/skills. SF units normally accomplish individual skills training through Unit
   Orientation Training (previously known as Phase I), Duty Position Qualification Training
   (previously known as Phase II), Continuation Training, Ancillary Training, and Specialized
   Training.
   4.3.2. Continuation Training and Individual/Collective Skills Training are on-going training
   tailored to the individual job and its overall execution. Continuation training is designed to
   keep individuals current in their tactical skills, familiar with local TTPs, and appraised of
   threats, security procedures, and mission changes affecting them. This training should also
   include a method of determining the effectiveness of the nuclear and non-nuclear weapon
   security program through appropriate recurring evaluations and exercises. Individual skills
   training provides the foundational elements our Airmen must accomplish in order to
   effectively perform their job. (T-1). Collective skills training builds upon individual skills
   applied in teams, such as a fire team, squad, flight, emergency services team, and response
   force element or UTC team. SF personnel can execute individual/collective skills training in
   a variety of ways, to include training as teams during flight-level exercises.
   4.3.3. Battle drills are collective actions rapidly executed without applying a deliberate
   decision-making process. Battle drills are limited to actions requiring an instantaneous
   response. They require minimal orders from the leader to accomplish and routinely apply to
   flights or smaller units. While SF normally act as flights or smaller units, battle drills may
   involve multiple teams (such as fire teams) acting independently to achieve a common
   objective. Therefore, SF must regularly train collectively in order to understand and apply
   battle drills.
   4.3.4. Training exercises and battle drill rehearsals reinforce and sustain proficiency in
   individual and collective skills. Additionally, exercises provide training on collective tasks
   and integrate all elements of an SF unit’s capabilities.
   4.3.5. Unit Orientation Training indoctrinates newly assigned personnel to the unit’s mission
   and prepares them to carry out their SF duties and responsibilities. This training is instructed
   by
   S-3/Training or unit Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). This training is conducted prior to
   individuals being released to S-3/Flight or other permanent unit positions.
      4.3.5.1. As a minimum, SF units will cover the training subjects listed on the HQ AFSFC
      website at: https://afsfmil.lackland.af.mil/sfot-training.html. (T-1).
22                                                              AFI36-2646 13 APRIL 2012


  4.3.6. The UTM will conduct a review of the member’s AFTR during Unit Orientation
  Training. UTM will request AFTR account transfer from losing unit if account cannot be
  accessed.
     4.3.6.1. Some of these subjects may be covered during Base Orientation or at First Term
     Airman Center (FTAC); however, it is imperative the training received in Unit
     Orientation Training be specific to the SF unit’s mission and first-responder
     responsibilities.
  4.3.7. Ancillary Training is universal training, guidance, or instruction, regardless of Air
  Force Specialty Code (AFSC), that contributes to mission accomplishment. Ancillary
  training can be a one-time event or recurring requirement. Refer to AFI 36-2201 for specific
  ancillary training requirements. A consolidated list of ancillary training is listed on the HQ
  AFSFC website at: https://afsfmil.lackland.af.mil/sfot-training.html
     4.3.7.1. Specialized training is unique training pertaining to an SF Airman’s specific
     duties and duty location. Examples of this specialized training include: mechanical and
     thermal breaching, or the Close Precision Engagement Course. A supervisory level,
     highly knowledgeable and task certified individual shall certify this training. (T-2).
     4.3.7.2. All required training, whether initial or follow-on, not otherwise documented in
     an approved Air Force database such as ADLS or Security Forces Management
     Information System (SFMIS) must be annotated in AFTR. (T-1).
  4.3.8. AFI 36-2201 states that SNCOs who hold a skill level commensurate with their grade
  and Duty Air Force Specialty Code (DAFSC) are considered qualified and do not require
  training records; however, every SF, to include officers, SNCOs and DAF civilians (080/LE,
  083, 085) must maintain an AFTR account to facilitate documentation of training. The Job
  Qualification Standard (JQS) will be used for upgrade training (if necessary) and/or for those
  duty positions that require duty position evaluation.
  4.3.9. As a minimum, the following tabs within AFTR will be utilized: Profile I, Profile II,
  623 I, 623 II, 623 III, 623a, AF Form 797 and AF Form1098.
  4.3.10. Duty Position Qualification Training is hands-on training designed to qualify SF in a
  specific duty position. Initial training begins the day the member is released from training
  and assigned to the S-3/flight or work center. Supervisors and trainers play a vital role to
  ensure their trainees are proficient in the skills required for their duty position.
     4.3.10.1. Supervisors and trainers must ensure trainees are provided hands-on, over-the-
     shoulder training and can complete the performance aspects of a duty position before
     receiving a Duty Position Evaluation (DPE). The majority of this training encompasses
     only individual skills, but could require some collective skills training with flight
     members.
     4.3.10.2. Supervisors will ensure personnel under their supervision complete duty
     position qualification training for each duty position within 60 calendar days of
     completing orientation training. (T-3). NOTE: This includes assigned IMAs and Air
     Reserve Component volunteers performing active duty for 30 days or more.
     4.3.10.3. An individual may receive qualification training for more than one duty
     position at a time.
AFI36-2646 13 APRIL 2012                                                                     23


     4.3.10.4. National Guard Bureau (NGB/A7S) and AFRC will outline duty position
     qualification training timelines in their supplement to this instruction for Drill Status
     Guard (DSG) and traditional Reserve members who perform an installation security
     mission. Air Reserve Technicians will maintain the same duty position qualification
     timelines as active duty.
     4.3.10.5. After completion of the duty position qualification training, the supervisor will
     notify
     S-3/Training and submit member’s AFTR for review. This is completed no later than 3
     duty days after completion of the training.
     4.3.10.6. Supervisors notify S-3/Training in writing if the trainee will be unable to
     complete qualification training within 60 calendar days. Document the circumstances,
     dates and the reasons for the delay in the individual's AFTR.
     4.3.10.7. S-3/Training will verify completion of duty position qualification training by
     reviewing the individual AFTR and comparing the completed tasks to the MTL.
     4.3.10.8. The MTL identifies all day-to-day mission (duty position) requirements, core
     tasks, in-garrison and contingency tasks and additional duties performed by personnel.
         4.3.10.8.1. MTLs will be completed for each work center to ensure 100% task
         coverage.
         4.3.10.8.2. MTLs will identify all critical work center/duty position tasks.
         4.3.10.8.3. The S-3/Flight MTLs will include Attachment 4 of this document, which
         mandates the minimum core tasks for select S-3/Flight duty positions (Installation
         Entry Controller, SF Patrol and Flight Chief/Commander).
         4.3.10.8.4. MTLs will be approved by the appropriate work center superintendent or
         as delegated by the DFC.
  4.3.11. S-3/Training will notify Stan/Eval when duty position qualification training is
  complete. NOTE: This initiates the DPE cycle.
  4.3.12. S-3/Training will develop unit MTP to ensure 100 % task coverage.
     4.3.12.1. At a minimum, the MTP must include:
     4.3.12.2. Current CFETP or Air Force Job Qualification Standard (AFJQS).
     4.3.12.3. Locally developed or electronic equivalent AF Form 797, Job Qualification
     Standard (JQS) Continuation/Command JQS.
     4.3.12.4. Milestones for tasks and CDC completion.
     4.3.12.5. Projected timeframe the trainee will complete all required tasks, HST,
     deployment/UTC) tasks and CDCs as required.
  4.3.13. For SF training program documentation purposes, the following are designated as the
  lowest level work centers for traditional SF squadrons: SFM, S-1, S-2, S-3, S-4 and S-5.
  Subordinate elements will not be considered work centers and all duty positions within each
  subordinate element will be listed under each work center. For example, Patrolman and
24                                                               AFI36-2646 13 APRIL 2012


  Training Instructor would be duty positions under S-3 and Pass and Registration Clerk would
  be a duty position under S-5.
     4.3.13.1. SF units not using the organizational S-structure will use the three-letter branch
     designator (i.e., SFA, SFT, SFO) as the lowest level work center. All duty positions
     within subordinate elements will be listed as duty positions under these work centers. For
     example, Patrolman would be a duty position under SFO, Training Instructor would be a
     duty position under SFT and Pass and Registration Clerk would be a position under SFA.
  4.3.14. Annual Training Schedule. S-3/Training will develop an Annual Training Schedule
  which is approved by the DFC. The schedule will prioritize the DFCs training priorities and
  provide a schedule to ensure all personnel are trained on recurring training topics every 12
  months or as directed.
     4.3.14.1. S-3/Training coordinates the Annual Training Schedule with unit work centers
     and base agencies. To the greatest extent possible, training should coincide with work
     schedules.
     4.3.14.2. S-3/Training will review the Annual Training Schedule monthly and update as
     necessary. The DFC must approve all changes.
     4.3.14.3. The Annual Training Schedule must include the following:
         4.3.14.3.1. Twelve month training schedule, incorporating all HST and ancillary
         training requirements.
             4.3.14.3.1.1. Consolidated listing of required HST and their associated training

     Special Task Certification and Recurring Training.
     4.3.15.2. The AUoF and Rules of Engagement (ROE) basic training provided by Combat
     Arms (CA) personnel during weapons qualification training, as outlined in AFI 36-2226,
     Combat Arms Program, does not replace this training.
     4.3.15.3. S-3/Training administers the AUoF written test and practical scenario after
     training.
     4.3.15.4. S-3/Training should utilize the AUoF e-TTPG to assist with training and
     practical scenario.
         4.3.15.4.1. The AUoF test will consist of a minimum of 25 multiple-choice
         questions.
         NOTE: Local procedures will be established to secure the test and prevent test
         compromise.
AFI36-2646 13 APRIL 2012                                                                     25

            3/Training) prior to retaking the test or performance-based practical decision-
            making scenario(s). The retraining will be conducted and documented IAW AFI
            36-2201.
            4.3.15.4.3.2. The individual must re-take and pass the written and/or
            performance-based practical decision-making scenario to be eligible for arming
            reinstatement. A different version of the written test will be administered for re-
            testing.
  4.3.16. S-3/Training administers a Weapons Knowledge test to measure member’s
  knowledge of primary SF weapons in conjunction with AUoF training.
     4.3.16.1. Test will be documented on the AFTR AF Form 1098.
     4.3.16.2. If an individual is qualified on both the M4 and M9, the test will consist of
     questions pertaining to both weapons.

     4.3.17.2. DFCs will provide written justification to parent MAJCOM/A7S if the unit is
     unable to complete mandated training requirements.
         4.3.17.2.1. Unit will route training          waiver    requests   through    the   parent
         MAJCOM/A7S for concurrence.
         4.3.17.2.2. If MAJCOM concurs, the request will be forwarded to HQ AFSFC for
         routing to the appropriate SF CFM for final approval. NOTE: The appropriate SF
         CFM is the waiver authority for mandated career field specific training requirements.
         4.3.17.2.3. Reference AFI 36-2201 when requesting waivers from specialty
         qualification requirements (entry, award or retention of AFS and respective skill
         level) from the CFETP or the Air Force Officer/Enlisted Classification Directories
         (AFOCD/AFECD).
  4.3.18. S-3/Training will incorporate collective skills training into all SF training.
     4.3.18.1. Collective skills training builds on individual skills in a team effort, such as a
     fire team, squad, flight, emergency services team, and response force element or UTC
     team.
     4.3.18.2. SF can execute collective training in a variety of ways, to include training
     collectively during flight-level exercises and field training. Again, emphasis must be
     placed upon using leader-led training at the fire team, squad and flight level.
     4.3.18.3. Battle drills are actions rapidly executed without applying a deliberate decision-
     making process. Battle rehearsals are an execution of the battle drill.
         4.3.18.3.1. Battle drills are limited to actions requiring an instantaneous response.
         They require minimal orders from the leader to accomplish and routinely apply to
         flights or smaller units.
  4.3.19. Upgrade Training.
     4.3.19.1. SF (Officer/Enlisted) has specific training requirements before being upgraded
     in skill level. AFI 36-2201 outlines requirements for personnel skills development.
     4.3.19.2. The Air Force Officer and Enlisted Classification Directories
     (AFOCD/AFECD) on the AFPC website and 3P0X1/X1A/X1B CFETP also contain
     specific upgrade training requirements.
     4.3.19.3. SF 5 and 7-skill level core tasks can be found in the 3P0X1, SF STS within
     CFETP 3P0X1/X1A/X1B.
AFI36-2646 13 APRIL 2012                                                                       27


          4.3.19.3.1. Personnel in upgrade training must be trained on these tasks in order to be
          upgraded to the 5 and 7-skill levels. Part 1 of the CFETP outlines the education and
          training requirements for skill level upgrade.
          4.3.19.3.2. It is the responsibility of the trainee to take an active role in meeting
          upgrade training.
      4.3.19.4. Air Force Specialty Code Shreds. Personnel completing the Military Working
      Dog (MWD) Handler Course or the Combat Arms Apprentice Course must have the
      appropriate shred added to their AFSC. This should occur during the member’s initial
      AFTR review with the UTM.
          4.3.19.4.1. The UTM will verify AFSC data and update the appropriate shred/skill
          level for MWD (3P031A) or CA (3P031B) in MilPDS as part of the member’s
          control AFSC.
          4.3.19.4.2. The UTM will enter the member into 5-skill level upgrade training.
      4.3.19.5. Combat Arms Specialist Training. In addition to training requirements set forth
      in this instruction and in the CFETP, CA personnel will also meet training requirements
      in
      AFI 36-2226.
      4.3.19.6. MWD Handlers/Kennel Masters Training. In addition to training requirements
      set forth in this instruction and in the CFETP, MWD personnel will also meet training
      requirements in AFI 31-202, Military Working Dog Program.
      4.3.19.7. Prior Service Personnel. Prior service members entering the SF Career Field
      who previously held a Military Occupational Specialty/Navy Enlisted Classification
      (MOS/NEC) listed as direct convertible skills IAW the AFECD may arrive for direct
      duty without attending the SF Apprentice Course. They will be awarded a 3-skill level
      and entered into 5-skill level upgrade training. All prior service personnel will undergo
      Unit Orientation Training and Duty Position Qualification Training. Coordinate training
      arrangements with supervisors/trainers to identify individual training needs. Refer to AFI
      36-2201 and the AFECD for more specific criteria.
4.4. SF Shoot, Move and Communicate (SMC) Course Training/Evaluation.
   4.4.1. SMC course standardizes basic individual and team firearms tactical skills necessary
   to engage hostile threats. This course satisfies the mandatory requirement in AFI 36-2226 for
   SF unit live-fire sustainment training, five to seven months after completion of qualification
   training on their primary weapon(s).
   4.4.2. The CA section or other approved HQ AFSFC training venues identified on the HQ
   AFSFC training website will provide all SMC trainers/instructors initial task qualification
   and certification for the SMC course and ensure the qualification is documented in AFTR
   using the AF Form 797, SMC. (T-1).
   4.4.3. S-3/Training will ensure the unit has S3/Flight task-qualified SMC course trainer(s). It
   is also highly recommended S-3/Training maintain SF SMC course task qualified trainers to
   augment flight-specific training and add flexibility in the unit’s Annual Training Plan.
 28                                                                AFI36-2646 13 APRIL 2012


   4.4.4. Stan/Eval will conduct annual evaluations (using a Go/No-Go standard) of all unit
   SMC course trainers. The evaluation will ensure trainers are training all objectives of course
   curriculum. NOTE: Stan/Eval sections may incorporate annual evaluations into scheduled
   force-on-force evaluations. Units should develop checklists, using the AF Form 797, Job
   Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS, included with the SF SMC Course of
   Fire to facilitate evaluations.
4.5. Active Shooter Course Training/Evaluation.
   4.5.1. An active shooter scenario involves one or more subjects engaging in a shooting
   spree, random or systematic, with the intent and means to continuously harm or kill others.
   Active shooter training incorporates weapons handling, non-lethal weapons and SMC
   principles, including basic individual and fire team tactical skills necessary to engage hostile
   threats.
   4.5.2. S-3/Training will ensure the unit has S3/Flight task-qualified Active Shooter course
   trainer(s). It is also highly recommended S-3/Training maintain SF Active Shooter course
   task qualified trainers to augment flight-specific training and add flexibility in the unit’s
   Annual Training Plan.
   4.5.3. Active Shooter Trainers will receive their initial task qualification and certification
   from an Active Shooter Instructor/Train the Trainer Course. Supervisors will ensure all
   training is documented in AFTR, using AF Form 797, Active Shooter.
   4.5.4. Active shooter trainers will incorporate the approved SF active shooter lesson plans
   into all active shooter training. The approved active shooter course material is located on the
   HQ                         AFSFC                        website/SFOT                         at:
   https://afsfmil.lackland.af.mil/Organization/AFSFC/SFW/org_afsfc_sfxt_index.htm.
   4.5.5. Stan/Eval will conduct annual evaluations (using a Go/No-Go standard) of all unit
   Active Shooter course trainers. The evaluation will ensure trainers are training all objectives
   of course curriculum. NOTE: Stan/Eval sections may incorporate annual evaluations into
   scheduled force-on-force evaluations. Units should develop checklists, using the AF Form
   797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS, to facilitate evaluations.
4.6. SF Augmentee Program.
   4.6.1. AFPAM 10-243, Augmentation Duty, replaced the Resource Augmentation Duty
   (READY) Program with a more flexible, commander-directed program. The contents of
   AFPAM 10-243 are recommendations only and may be used in part or entirely.
   4.6.2. Wing Commanders or equivalent Geographically Separated Unit (GSU) Commander
   will determine if an installation augmentation program is required.
   4.6.3. If it is determined that a program is needed, it will be implemented and managed
   locally to support ID Force requirements as outlined in AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense.
   4.6.4. SF Augmentee Coordinator, assigned to S-3/Training, will coordinate augmentee
   training with tasked units/agencies.
   4.6.5. SF Augmentee Coordinator will maintain training records for each SF Augmentee.
   4.6.6. If utilized, personnel identified specifically as SF Augmentees will be trained on the
   tasks listed in Attachment 2, SF Augmentee Training Tasks. ID forces, such as armed
AFI36-2646 13 APRIL 2012                                                                        29


   owner/user protection personnel, unarmed owner/user protection personnel and unarmed ID
   force contributors can use Attachment 2 as potential training items.
      4.6.6.1. The DFC may direct additional training requirements to support the local
      mission.
   4.6.7. All SF Augmentee training will be documented in individual training records.
4.7. SF Training Resources and Equipment.
   4.7.1. TEEOs. These tools are developed at the unit level and are used by S-3/Training,
   Stan/Eval, supervisors/trainers and flight leadership to train and evaluate SF collectively.
      4.7.1.1. TEEOs contain an exercise overview, provide a suggested approach to
      conducting an exercise and specify the task, condition and standards.
      4.7.1.2. As a minimum, SF units will develop a TEEO for each contingency outlined in
      the installation’s Integrated Defense Plan (IDP).
      4.7.1.3. TEEOs should be broad-based and capture the aspects of the collective force.
      Standards contained within the TEEO should be derived from the IDP and written to the
      collective level. For example, “Did responding forces establish final denial to protect the
      resource?” or “Were the appropriate security requirements established for the Department
      of Energy (DoE) safe haven?”
      4.7.1.4. Task Performance Checklist (TPC) may be used to augment TEEOs if
      evaluation of individual tasks is necessary. Attachment 3 is a sample TEEO.
      4.7.1.5. S-3/Training and Stan/Eval will jointly develop TEEOs and TPCs for local
      training and evaluation.
      4.7.1.6. Coordinate local TPCs or similar computer generated products with S-
      3/Operations Officer or Superintendent.
      4.7.1.7. S-3/Operations Officer or Superintendent will validate the checklists and ensure
      all tasks identified as critical on the MTL are also identified as critical on the TPCs. This
      will be annotated on the TPCs or official memorandum.
   4.7.2. S-3/Training will use the CFETP to plan, conduct, evaluate and document training.
      4.7.2.1. The SF CFETP (3P0X1/X1A/X1B) is the primary document used to identify
      life-cycle education and training requirements. It serves as a road map for SF career
      progression and outlines requirements that must be satisfied at appropriate points
      throughout the career path.
      4.7.2.2. CFETP also specifies the mandatory task qualification requirements for award
      and maintenance of an AFSC.
      4.7.2.3. Deployment/UTC task requirements can be identified with a symbol to assist
      commanders in prioritizing training.
      4.7.2.4. Supervisors use the CFETP to plan, prioritize, manage and execute training.
      4.7.2.5. CFETPs are used to identify and certify all past and current qualifications.

  4.7.3. SF Center of Training Excellence website. The SF CTE website provides SF members
  a single portal for access to various training programs, resources and tools. The SF CTE is
  found at: https://sf-cte.csd.disa.mil/kc/login/login.asp.
  4.7.4. Electronic - Tactics, Techniques and Procedures Guides (e-TTPG). These guides are
  accessible through the SF CTE website under “Security Forces Training Tools.” NOTE:
  Most
  e-TTPGs contain a pre-filled AF Form 689 which lists the subtasks associated with specific
  tasks.
     4.7.4.1. Most guides contain a lesson plan, TPC, high-resolution video, study guide and
     applicable references.
     4.7.4.2. The e-TTPGs will be used by S-3/Training, supervisors and trainers to the
     maximum extent possible and can be found on the HQ AFSFC website at:
     https://afsfmil.lackland.af.mil/Organization/AFSFC/SFW/org_afsfc_sfxt_tngref.htm
     .
     4.7.4.3. Recommendations to add or change e-TTPG subjects/content can be sent to the
     parent MAJCOM Training Manager for forwarding to HQ AFSFC.
  4.7.5. Unit Learning Center. The ULC is an area, usually within the unit and easily
  accessible to all unit members, that contains individual study materials, training resources
  and computer access. Follow these parameters when establishing a ULC:
     4.7.5.1. Adapt the ULC to suit the unit's mission, size and available space.
     4.7.5.2. Provide separate areas containing individual study materials, equipment and
     computer systems. Computer systems assigned to the ULC should parallel the latest
     technology afforded to other sections within the unit, but no more than one generation
     behind.
         4.7.5.2.1. The ULC computers will have network connection to allow access to
         AFTR and other on-line training resources.
     4.7.5.3. Units must ensure personnel have access to the ULC to the maximum extent
     possible.
  4.7.6. Obtaining training equipment is a unit responsibility. Training equipment will be
  standardized and consistent with approved duty equipment.
     4.7.6.1. S-3/Training will ensure all personnel have access to the training aids to use
     during Duty Position Qualification Training.
     4.7.6.2. Allowance Standard 538 lists requirements for issuing training equipment.

   5.3.2. When necessary, Stan/Eval may elicit unit SMEs to assist in conducting the
   performance portion of DPEs for specialized positions (for example, MWD handler and
   alarm monitors). At a minimum, unit evaluators (to include SMEs who augment Stan/Eval)
   will be task qualified (signed off in AFTR) on the tasks they evaluate while conducting
   DPEs.
5.4. Standard/Evaluation Functions.
   5.4.1. Functional Area Inspection Program.
      5.4.1.1. Stan/Eval will inspect each unit functional area or work center every 12 months.
      Air Reserve Component tenant and associate units will conduct functional area
      inspections at least every 2 years.
      5.4.1.2. Stan/Eval will organize an inspection team composed of Stan/Eval personnel and
      unit SMEs (as needed) when performing inspections of functional areas or work centers.
      5.4.1.3. Stan/Eval will coordinate with the SFM and appropriate unit leadership to
      identify inspection criteria and performance standards. Headquarters Air Force and
      MAJCOM CUI Core Checklists will be utilized when inspecting functional areas or work
      centers. CUI Core Checklists can be found on the Air Force Inspection Agency (AFIA)
      website at: https://www.my.af.mil/reservenetprod2/checklistservice/home.aspx.
          5.4.1.3.1. HAF/MAJCOM CUI Core Checklists are tools for use by Higher
          Headquarters (HHQ) and unit personnel when conducting assessments of programs or
          activities. They do not constitute the order or limit the scope of any HHQ or unit self-
          inspection. They do not limit the requirement to comply with any published DoD and
          AF policies, directives or instructions.
          5.4.1.3.2. Units are highly encouraged to develop and use local CUI checklists during
          Functional Area Inspections. The development of local CUI checklists will ensure
          local policies and procedures not identified within the HAF and MAJCOM CUI Core
          Checklists are being captured and inspected.
      5.4.1.4. Units may substitute a HHQ inspection (Inspector General or MAJCOM Staff
      Assisted Visit) for an annual Stan/Eval Functional Area Inspection if the inspection
      activity used Headquarters Air Force and MAJCOM CUI Core Checklists. NOTE: If
      substituting a HHQ inspection for an annual Stan/Eval Functional Area Inspection and
      not all functional areas or work centers were inspected, Stan/Eval is still responsible for
      inspecting those functional areas or work centers to meet the annual requirement.
   5.4.2. Stan/Eval Inspection Report Preparation and Processing.
      5.4.2.1. The Stan/Eval Inspection Team Chief signs inspection reports and provides a
      copy to the SFM for review within 3 duty days after the inspection. Stan/Eval will
      maintain a copy of the two most recent inspection reports for each activity inspected
      (hard or electronic; the electronic copy should include digital date).
      5.4.2.2. The SFM will review, validate and endorse inspection reports. The SFM will
      forward the report to the DFC for review. After the DFC review, the report will be sent to
      the inspected activities to correct any deficient areas discovered during the inspection.
AFI36-2646 13 APRIL 2012                                                                      33


     5.4.2.3. Stan/Eval will establish a tracking system for discrepancies noted during annual
     inspections. The system will monitor open discrepancies until the inspected activity
     corrects the deficiency.
         5.4.2.3.1. The inspected activity will provide Stan/Eval with monthly updates
         outlining what actions are being taken to correct discrepancies. Stan/Eval will route to
         SFM and DFC for review.
         5.4.2.3.2. When a discrepancy is permanently corrected by the inspected activity, the
         DFC will endorse the corrective action and forward the update to Stan/Eval for the
         finding to be closed.
         5.4.2.3.3. Stan/Eval will maintain monthly updates for the two most recent inspection
         reports for each functional area.
  5.4.3. Duty Position Evaluation. This evaluation measures an individual’s ability to perform
  duties within a given duty position and also validates the effectiveness of the training
  provided to the individual being evaluated. A DPE consists of the following:
     5.4.3.1. Verbal Evaluation. The verbal evaluation will consist of a question-and-answer
     period. These verbal questions will be subject-knowledge and task-knowledge based and
     will be formulated using training references associated with the duty position under
     consideration as found on the work center MTL. Avoid questions that elicit a one-word
     response.
         5.4.3.1.1. Assign point values to questions in advance of the verbal evaluation; the
         evaluation will be at least 25-questions.
         5.4.3.1.2. Units will establish local procedures to secure all forms of testing media
         used for verbal tests.
     5.4.3.2. Performance Evaluation. This evaluation measures the individual’s ability to
     successfully perform the duties for the specific duty position under consideration.
         5.4.3.2.1. Performance evaluations will be conducted during the normal duty
         schedule and while the individual is on post or in their work center.
         5.4.3.2.2. If approved by the MAJCOM, units may conduct performance evaluations
         at support base training sites. MAJCOM will identify duty positions which may be
         evaluated at the support base.
         5.4.3.2.3. Team positions will be evaluated while the member is performing duties as
         part of the team.
         5.4.3.2.4. Immediately following the evaluation, Stan/Eval will provide feedback to
         the individual/team. Performance evaluation will use the Go/No-Go rating system.
     5.4.3.3. M4 carbine/M9 pistol Performance Evaluation. Evaluation is based upon
     weapon(s) certifications. This evaluation ensures SF personnel can perform general
     weapon procedures and have a general knowledge of the capabilities and functionality of
     the weapons system(s) for which they are certified. M4 carbine/M9 pistol Performance
     Evaluations are only required to be conducted once annually and are not required for
     subsequent Duty Position Evaluations conducted within a year of initial M4 carbine/M9
     pistol Performance Evaluation for critical and 18 months for non-critical.
34                                                             AFI36-2646 13 APRIL 2012


        5.4.3.3.1. The weapons performance evaluation will encompass, as a minimum,
        clearing procedures,     operator    inspections,  function checks, loading,
        charging/chambering a round, reloading and immediate actions (failure to fire).
     5.4.3.4. Verbal Weapon Evaluation. The verbal evaluation will consist of a question and
     answer period. (T-1). The intent of this evaluation is to ensure SF personnel understand
     the capabilities and functionality of their weapon system(s). Verbal questions will be
     subject knowledge and task knowledge-based and will be formulated using the authorized
     operator’s manual and references found in the e-TTPGs associated with the weapon(s)
     being evaluated. (T-1). The verbal weapon evaluation will encompass, as a minimum, the
     weapon’s nomenclature and the range determination estimation for maximum effective
     and maximum ranges. (T-1). Verbal Weapon Evaluations are only required to be
     conducted once annually and are not required for subsequent Duty Position Evaluations
     conducted within a year of initial Verbal Weapon Evaluation for critical and 18 months
     for non-critical .
        5.4.3.4.1. Assign point values to questions in advance of the verbal evaluation; the
        evaluation will be at least 20-questions.
     5.4.3.5. Written Evaluation. Written evaluations are not required, but MAJCOMs may
     incorporate a written evaluation in the DPE process. If a written evaluation is
     incorporated, MAJCOMs will provide clear, written guidance to subordinate units on all
     aspects of the written portion to include but not limited to: how many questions will be
     on the test, type of test (multiple choice, scenario based, forms, etc), securing data,
     scoring/rating and failures/ decertification.
        5.4.3.5.1. Questions will be subject-knowledge and task-knowledge based and will
        be formulated using training references, associated with the duty position under
        consideration as found on the work center MTL, to include standard forms associated
        with the duty position.
     5.4.3.6. Where one is available, e-TTPG TPCs should be used to administer the
     performance portion of DPEs. If an e-TTPG TPC is not available, or to supplement an e-
     TTPG TPC, units may use local TPCs to conduct the performance portion of DPEs.
     MAJCOMs may mandate that locally developed TPCs or computer generated products be
     approved at their level prior to use.
     5.4.3.7. Simulated and non-functional firearms/weapons used by Stan/Eval during DPEs
     must be approved by the DFC prior to their use and strictly controlled by Stan-Eval.
        5.4.3.7.1. Simulated firearms will be of a color that is immediately distinguishable
        from real weapons.
        5.4.3.7.2. As a minimum, control measures will include the development of a local
        method to uniquely identify each simulated firearm and accountability procedures to
        record when they are signed in/out by unit personnel.
        5.4.3.7.3. Weapons used during M4/M9 performance evaluations will be readily
        identifiable. (T-1). The M4 must have a blue muzzle cap affixed to the compensator
        and the M9 must have blue tape (i.e., painters tape) wrapped around the pistol grip.
        (T-1). Magazines used will be readily identifiable through the use of blue tape or blue
AFI36-2646 13 APRIL 2012                                                                       35


         paint. (T-1). The M4/M9 used during the performance evaluation will be cleared by a
         certified clearing barrel attendant IAW AFMAN 31-229, USAF Weapons Handling
         Manual. (T-1). Additionally, prior to initiating performance evaluations, the evaluator
         will verify the weapon is cleared by locking the bolt/slide to the rear and inserting a
         cleaning rod into the muzzle end of the barrel until it passes through the bore and
         chamber to ensure no ammunition is present in the chamber, and then remove the
         cleaning rod. (T-1). NOTE: Use of live ammunition or spent brass casings is not
         authorized for performance evaluations. Dummy rounds are the sole authorized
         rounds for performance evaluations and will be maintained and strictly controlled by
         Stan-Eval. (T-1).
         5.4.3.7.4. “On-duty” weapons will not be used during the evaluation. If an armed SF
         is being evaluated, the duty weapon will not be allowed in the evaluation area.
  5.4.4. Duty Position Categories. Duty positions are categorized as either critical or non-
  critical. The DFC will identify all S-3/Flight duty positions (critical and non-critical) either
  in a local Operating Instruction (OI) or official memorandum. All S-3/Flight duty positions
  will be certified by Stan/Eval.
     5.4.4.1. Critical Positions. A critical position is one that requires precise accomplishment
     of assigned duties crucial to mission accomplishment. Individuals will not perform
     independently in a critical duty position until successfully completing the DPE process.
     NOTE: While in Duty Position Qualification Training, individuals may perform in a
     critical duty position, as an alternate, and must be under continuous supervision from an
     individual DPE certified in that position. The duty positions listed below are designated
     as critical.
         5.4.4.1.1. Key positions in direct support of nuclear resources.
         5.4.4.1.2. Convoy Commanders.
         5.4.4.1.3. Area Supervisors.
         5.4.4.1.4. Limited Area Entry Controller/Close In Sentry.
         5.4.4.1.5. Exclusion Area Entry Controllers.
         5.4.4.1.6. Flight Chief.
         5.4.4.1.7. Confinement/Detention Positions (with facilities/cells).
         5.4.4.1.8. Alarm monitors (regardless of type of electronic security system or
         resource being monitored).
         5.4.4.1.9. Command and Control (C2) positions (Desk Sergeant, Security Controller,
         Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC)/Emergency Communications Center (ECC)
         Controller, etc).
         5.4.4.1.10. Other duty positions as designated by the MAJCOM/A7S or the unit
         DFC.
     5.4.4.2. Non-critical positions. Non-critical positions are those positions whose exacting
     accomplishment of assigned duties is less crucial to the accomplishment of the mission.
36                                                              AFI36-2646 13 APRIL 2012


        5.4.4.2.1. At the discretion of the DFC, individuals may work non-critical duty
        positions independently prior to being certified through the DPE process. If allowed,
        the DFC must identify these non-critical duty positions in a local OI or official
        memorandum. Additionally, if allowed by the DFC, the individual must be task-
        qualified (annotated in AFTR) on all critical tasks associated with these duty
        positions, as identified on the work center MTL, prior to the trainee working that
        particular non-critical position independently.
     5.4.4.3. DPE Cycle. The DPE cycle initiates when S-3/Training notifies Stan/Eval of an
     individual’s completion of Duty Position Qualification Training. Within 30 calendar days
     of being notified, Stan/Eval will complete the initial DPE for personnel assigned to active
     duty units (includes AFRC and ANG personnel while assigned to an active duty unit).
        5.4.4.3.1. Non-critical certifications are valid for a period of 18 months. Subsequent
        certifications must be completed by the last day of the anniversary month. For
        example, if an individual is certified on 5 Jan 12, the subsequent DPE must be
        completed by 31 Jul 13. If a recertification is not completed by the end of the
        anniversary month, the certification expires.
        5.4.4.3.2. Critical duty certifications are valid for a period of 12 months. Subsequent
        certifications must be completed by the last day of the anniversary month. For
        example, an individual is certified on 5 Jan 12, the subsequent DPE must be
        completed by 31 Jan 13. If a recertification is not completed by the end of the
        anniversary month, the certification expires.
        5.4.4.3.3. IMAs will be evaluated every 24 months for a non-critical duty position
        and                                                                           every
        18 months for critical duty positions. GB/A7S and AFRC will outline DPE timelines
        in their supplement to this instruction for DSG and traditional Reserve members who
        perform an installation security mission. Air Reserve Technicians will maintain the
        same duty position qualification timelines as active duty.
        5.4.4.3.4. Deployment cycles must be taken into account when scheduling
        subsequent DPEs. Units should make every effort to recertify expiring critical duty
        certifications prior to deployments. MAJCOMs and DFCs may direct additional no-
        notice evaluations.
        5.4.4.3.5. If recertification could not be conducted on critical/non-critical duty
        positions prior to deployment, it must be accomplished within 45 calendar days of a
        member returning to duty.
        5.4.4.3.6. Supervisors will annotate any delay in the DPE cycle and the cause of the
        delay in the individual's AFTR. The unit will develop local procedures to ensure S-
        3/Training and Stan/Eval are notified of the delay and its cause.
        5.4.4.3.7. Contracted Personnel. Evaluate contract personnel as identified in the
        SOW or PWS. NOTE: Evaluation results should be made available to Quality
        Assurance Evaluators (QAE).
        5.4.4.3.8. DAF CP/SG Employees. Evaluate using the DPE Cycle as outlined in
        paragraph 5.4.4.3., and the criteria outlined in paragraph 5.4.3. and paragraph 5.4.4.2.
AFI36-2646 13 APRIL 2012                                                                       37


         5.4.4.3.9. DFCs are encouraged to require personnel assigned to unit staff positions
         to maintain S-3 duty position certification(s) to backfill S-3 personnel shortfalls,
         augment on-duty SF during increased Force Protection (FP) Conditions and other
         contingency operations. Examples of personnel exempt from a DPE would only be
         those individuals filling unique staff positions requiring specific rank, duty,
         supervisory/management and experience requirements, for which a DPE does not
         exist (i.e., SFM, S-3 Operations Officer/Superintendent, S-4 OIC/Superintendent,
         etc).
             5.4.4.3.9.1. Staff positions are identified as SF personnel assigned to S-Staff
             functions that do not arm on a daily basis in support of the S-3 Operations Flight.
             5.4.4.3.9.2. The intent is to ensure SF personnel not performing day-to-day
             integrated defense duties at the operational flight level maintain the prerequisite
             knowledge and skills needed to perform the mission during contingencies or as
             directed by the DFC.
             5.4.4.3.9.3. The DFC will identify all duty positions requiring position
             certification, either in a local OI or official memorandum.
     5.4.4.4. If an individual requires evaluation for multiple duty positions with similar tasks,
     they may be evaluated all at once during one DPE (i.e., Internal Security Response Team
     (ISRT)/External Security Response Team (ESRT) members). The NCOIC of Stan/Eval
     must ensure combined evaluations adequately encompass the duties of each duty
     position.
     5.4.4.5. After the individual passes the initial DPE, establish a date for subsequent
     evaluations according to paragraph 5.4.4.3.1. or 5.4.4.3.2.
     5.4.4.6. If approved by the DFC, persons having fewer than 90 calendar days remaining
     until discharge, retirement, retraining or are within 90 calendar days of permanent change
     of station may be exempted from DPEs. IMAs and ARC with less than 180 calendar days
     remaining until discharge, retirement or retraining may be exempted from DPEs. ANG
     personnel with less than six Unit Training Assemblies (UTA) or 180 days remaining
     (whichever is less) may also be exempted by the DFC. If approved by the DFC, these
     individuals are still considered certified in the duty positions they hold (critical/non-
     critical). The DFC’s approval of exemptions will be in memorandum format (filed in
     Stan/Eval) or as a blanket exemption in a local OI.
  5.4.5. DPE Documentation. A final report will be produced to provide an overview of each
  DPE. The report will contain a minimum of the verbal evaluation scores, written evaluation
  score (if applicable) and M4 carbine/M9 pistol performance evaluation deficiencies. In
  addition, the report will provide a synopsis of the duty position performance evaluation
  scenario and the subject area deficiencies for all portions of the DPE. Evaluator notes from
  the performance portion of the DPE will be transcribed from the TPC or similar computer
  generated product to the final report. A copy of the report will be provided to the member’s
  supervisor, SFM and SFO. The report will be filed in the individual’s Stan/Eval file (hard or
  electronic).
 38                                                               AFI36-2646 13 APRIL 2012


5.5. Evaluation and Rating System.
   5.5.1. For all duty positions, individuals must receive at least a 70% to pass the verbal
   weapons evaluation.
   5.5.2. For non-critical duty positions, individuals must receive at least a 70% to pass the
   verbal portion of the DPE. For critical duty positions, individuals must receive at least an
   80% to pass the verbal portion of the DPE.
   5.5.3. Individuals must also earn a “Go” on the performance portion of their DPE. “Go”
   means the individual can perform the duties without assistance and meets local demands for
   accuracy, timeliness and correct use of procedures. This doesn’t necessarily translate to
   requiring an error free performance evaluation to receive a “Go”, but does mandate
   individuals successfully perform all critical tasks that were evaluated during the performance
   portion of DPEs. These critical tasks must be identified for every unit S-3/Flight duty
   position (critical and non-critical) and reflected on the MTL and correlating TPC.
      5.5.3.1. For example, the TPC used by Stan/Eval to evaluate the unit’s alarm monitor
      duty position contains 35 specific tasks; the unit has designated 28 of these tasks as being
      critical to the functioning of the position. To successfully pass the performance portion of
      the DPE and receive a “Go”, all critical performance tasks which were measured during
      the DPE must be successfully completed without assistance. Table 5.1 provides an
      example of the DPE rating system.
   5.5.4. The M4 carbine/M9 pistol performance evaluation will be a factor in the DPE rating
   system. Individuals earning a “No-Go” in any area during the evaluation will be given a
   second attempt to successfully complete the task. The individual will be allotted no more
   than five calendar days of supervisor/trainer-administered review training prior to being
   rescheduled for a reevaluation.
      5.5.4.1. If any task is not successfully completed on the second attempt, the individual
      will receive a “No-Go” for that particular weapon. (T-1). In addition, the individual will
      immediately be decertified on the firearm for which they received the “No-Go” and they
      will not be armed with this model firearm until they successfully complete the
      performance evaluation. (T-1). This action will not affect the member’s certification on
      other weapons or their authority to bear firearms. (T-1).
      5.5.4.2. The individual's supervisor/trainer will re-train the task(s) and annotate the
      training in the trainee’s AFTR, IAW AFI 36-2201, and notify S-3/Training when review
      training has been completed. S-3/Training will verify completion of the review training
      and notify Stan/Eval to reschedule the performance evaluation. Stan/Eval will reevaluate
      the individual ASAP, but no later than five calendar days after being notified by S-
      3/Training.

Critical duty position: 79% on verbal exam and ‘No-Go’ on weapons performance evaluation;
individual must successfully complete a reevaluation in these two areas prior to being certified and will
have authority to bear firearms removed (after second attempt) until a ‘Go’ is received in the
performance weapons evaluation area.
Non-critical duty position: 69% on verbal exam and ‘No-Go’ on the performance evaluation; individual
must successfully complete a reevaluation in these two areas prior to being certified.

   5.5.5. Duty Position Evaluation Failures.
       5.5.5.1. If the verbal or performance portion of a DPE is failed, the trainee will be
       allotted no more than 30 calendar days of supervisor/trainer-administered review training
       prior to being rescheduled for a reevaluation. NOTE: NGB/A7S and AFRC will outline
       DPE review training timeline requirements in their supplement to this instruction for
       DSG and traditional Reserve members who perform an installation security mission. Air
       Reserve Technicians will maintain the same timelines as active duty.
       5.5.5.2. When an individual fails a DPE, the S-3/Operations Officer (or DFC designee
       for units not having an S-3/Operations Officer) and S-3/Operations Superintendent or the
       appropriate section superintendent will determine which training requirements will be
       reviewed based upon recommendations from the individual’s immediate chain of
       command. The supervisor/trainer will ensure the recommended training plan is annotated
       in the member’s AFTR. The DFC and SFM will be notified and briefed on the failure and
       the recommended courses of action.
       5.5.5.3. The individual's supervisor/trainer will re-train the task(s) and annotate the
       trainee’s AFTR IAW AFI 36-2201, and notify S-3/Training when review training is
       completed. S-3/Training will verify completion of review training and notify Stan/Eval to
       reschedule the failed portion(s) of the DPE. Stan/Eval will reevaluate the individual no
       later than 30 calendar days after being notified by S-3/Training. NOTE: NGB/A7S and
       AFRC will outline reevaluation training timelines in their supplement to this instruction
       for DSG and traditional Reserve members who perform an installation security mission.
       Air Reserve Technicians will maintain the same reevaluation timelines as active duty.
       5.5.5.4. The DFC and SFM, in coordination with the S-3/Operations Officer (or DFC
       designee for units not having an S-3/Operations Officer) and S-3/Superintendent will
 40                                                               AFI36-2646 13 APRIL 2012


       approve supervisor/trainer-administered review training requirements for subsequent
       DPE failures.
       5.5.5.5. Critical DPE failures. Members will not be allowed to work in that position
       without direct supervision until successfully completing a reevaluation.
       5.5.5.6. Non-critical DPE failures. The DFC may authorize members who have failed a
       DPE to work in that position while awaiting their reevaluation, but only after completion
       of review training as outlined in paragraph 5.4.4.3.2.
   5.5.6. Duty Position Decertification. This process is reserved for instances where an
   individual’s proficiency in or suitability for a specific duty position has been called into
   question. Recommendations to decertify normally come from supervisors/flight leadership,
   but can also come from personnel in unit leadership positions. The DFC will designate
   decertification authority, by position, in a local OI.
       5.5.6.1. If reconsidered for the duty position after decertification, the individual's
       supervisor/trainer will conduct review training on the deficient task(s) and annotate the
       trainee’s AFTR IAW AFI 36-2201, and notify S-3/Training when review training is
       completed. The trainee will be allotted no more than 30 calendar days of review training
       prior to being scheduled for a reevaluation.
       5.5.6.2. S-3/Training will verify completion of review training and notify Stan/Eval to
       schedule a complete DPE (verbal and performance). Stan/Eval will reevaluate the
       individual no later than 30 calendar days after being notified by S-3/Training.
5.6. Duty Position Evaluation Records Disposition.
   5.6.1. Distribute copies of the DPE final report to the individual’s supervisor, S-3/Operations
   Superintendent, S-3/Training, SFM, DFC and the member evaluated. NOTE: This
   requirement may be accomplished using electronic means.
   5.6.2. Stan/Eval will maintain the original evaluation report IAW the Air Force Records
   Disposition Schedule (RDS).
5.7. Trend Analysis Report. Stan/Eval will provide a quarterly trend analysis to the DFC,
S-3/Operations Officer/Superintendent and S-3/Training. The analysis will focus on individual
DPE reports from the previous quarter. This analysis is designed to provide the DFC feedback on
the status of the unit’s training program and highlight areas where training should be more
focused.
   5.7.1. Quarterly trend analysis reports should be made available to all unit personnel; this
   will ensure any trends (negative or positive) are corrected or reinforced during duty position
   qualification training and flight-level exercises.
   5.7.2. S3/Training should use these trend analyses to focus quarterly training and identify
   training shortfalls.
   5.7.3. Consider using the trend analysis to focus the SF Duty Officer on specific job
   knowledge weaknesses.

            SECURITY FORCES EXPEDITIONARY TRAINING PROGRAM

6.1. SF Expeditionary Training Program Concept. The SF Expeditionary Training Program
incorporates EST and SF CRT. EST is administered at home station, SF Regional Training
Centers (RTC), other Tier-3 training sites or other approved DoD training venues.
6.2. Responsibilities.
   6.2.1. Director of Security Forces (AF/A7S).
       6.2.1.1. Prescribes the SF CRT.
   6.2.2. SF Officer (HQ AFSFC/CC), Enlisted (AF/A7SM) and Civilian (HQ AFSFC/DS)
   CFM.
       6.2.2.1. Establishes SF EST policies and direction.
   6.2.3. HQ AFSFC.
       6.2.3.1. Publishes SF CRT.
       6.2.3.2. Ensures development, standardization and evaluation of SF EST and CRT
       objectives and requirements.
       6.2.3.3. Manages SF EST and CRT; provides guidance to MAJCOMs.
   6.2.4. MAJCOM/A7S.
       6.2.4.1. MAJCOMs will provide SF EST and CRT guidance to units.
   6.2.5. MAJCOM Training Manager.
       6.2.5.1. Works in unison with the MAJCOM Deployment FAM to ensure SF tasked to
       deploy receive specialized training as directed by their deployment line remarks.
       6.2.5.2. Ensures SF tasked to deploy receive required Tier-3 pre-deployment training as
       scheduled by AFSFC/SFOC.
       6.2.5.3. Ensures SF postured against a DWS UTC posturing code, but not tasked during
       their deployment vulnerability window, receive EST sustainment training at an approved
       SF RTC.
   6.2.6. Defense Force Commander.
       6.2.6.1. Appoints an EST Manager in writing.
       6.2.6.2. Ensures all SF EST and CRT requirements are met.
   6.2.7. Unit S-3/Training.
       6.2.7.1. Performs as EST Manager ensuring all SF members meet the appropriate EST
       tiered training requirements.
6.3. Security Forces Combat Readiness Training.
   6.3.1. SF CRT is a combination of individual and collective skills. It provides every SF
   member with the capability to shoot, move and communicate. SF CRTs provide the
 42                                                               AFI36-2646 13 APRIL 2012


   foundation upon which every SF member’s mission preparation will begin and directly
   contributes to combat readiness.
       6.3.1.1. Readiness Training Center (RTC) training must be completed by all SF postured
       against a DW coded UTC. (T-1). Those personnel not scheduled for a deployment
       tasking will complete their RTC training within 90 days prior to entering their
       deployment vulnerability window. (T-1). All personnel who are scheduled to deploy in
       their deployment vulnerability window will be scheduled by AFSFC/SFOC to attend an
       RTC as close to their ‘available to load date’ as possible. (T-1). MAJCOM FAMS should
       work closely with AFSFC/SFOC to ensure all members within their MAJCOM attend
       RTC training in accordance with the guidance above. MAJCOMs will work with
       AFSFC/SFOC to provide further guidance regarding who is required to complete RTC
       training above and beyond this baseline requirement for availability as deployment
       backfill and ensure DOC response times can be met. Members completing RTC training
       must be proficient in the required CRT tasks identified in the Home Station Training
       (HST) table. (T-1). For readiness reporting purposes, individuals who have completed
       CRT requirements can be counted as meeting the expeditionary training requirement.
       6.3.1.2. To be considered proficient, defenders must train using the evaluate-train-
       evaluate methodology demonstrating proficiency on SF CRT tasks during their assigned
       deployment Band Battle Rhythm training & exercise window as outlined in AFI 10-401,
       Air Force Operations Planning and Execution.
   6.3.2. SF CRT is established IAW international treaties, law, DoD requirements, Combatant
   Commander requirements and Headquarters Air Force policy.
   6.3.3. A list of SF CRTs are located on the HQ AFSFC website at:
   https://afsfmil.lackland.af.mil/Organization/AFSFC/SFW/org_afsfc_sfxt_HomeStation.
   htm
6.4. Expeditionary Skills Training.
   6.4.1. Expeditionary Skills (ES) are defined as the knowledge, skills and abilities (KSA)
   required of a deployment-ready defender essential to survive, operate and succeed in a
   deployed environment, while reinforcing a strong warrior ethos.
       6.4.1.1. SF will complete EST as outlined in AFI 36-2201.
       6.4.1.2. These skills are obtained through a tiered training approach and target KSAs not
       routinely acquired during occupational and/or other ancillary training venues. EST must
       be relevant, synchronized, standardized and integrated across the Air Force to provide
       Combatant Commanders with defenders trained to support that theater’s requirements,
       while maximizing resources. EST is optimized when incorporated as a continuum across
       a defender’s career and aligned with mission tasking and deployments.
   6.4.2. Tier 1, Foundational EST. ES for all defenders delivered through accessions and
   initial occupational training, and sustained through developmental education. Defenders gain
   skills through Basic Military Training, Officer Accession venues, the Air and Space Basic
   Course and 3-skill level initial training. Completion of this training alone does not produce a
   deployable defender.
AFI36-2646 13 APRIL 2012                                                                    43


  6.4.3. Tier 2, Deployment-Ready EST. EST for all defenders, delivered at the wing level in
  alignment with assigned deployment band. Tier 2 is designed to ensure every defender
  maintains proficiency and sustain readiness currency for deployment, Tier 2 is divided into A
  and B categories. DFCs have maximum flexibility to efficiently execute Tier 2 training.
  Categories, requirements, frequencies and a current list of Tier 2 training is available at:
  https://aef.afpc.randolph.af.mil/mandatory_exped_trning.aspx.
     6.4.3.1. Defenders will maintain EST proficiency by completing Tier 2A training as they
     prepare for their postured deployment vulnerability period (reference AFPD 10-4,
     Operations Planning: Air and Space Expeditionary Forces). These training requirements
     must be accomplished by all members in preparation for their assigned deployment
     vulnerability period and are fulfilled by completing the computer-based training (CBT)
     on the ADLS at: https://golearn.csd.disa.mil.
     6.4.3.2. Tier 2B, Home Station Pre-Deployment Training. DFCs will provide Tier 2B
     training to those defenders tasked to deploy or to maintain mission-ready status to
     support and including major combat operations. Tier 2B home station pre-deployment
     training is a combination of ADLS, standardized classroom and standardized hands-on
     instruction. Tier 2B will meet Air Force entry requirements for a standard deployment to
     a permissive environment. Tier 2B will also serve as the prerequisite for defenders to
     attend Tier 3 or Tier 4 training. Tier 2A EST proficiency items that are accomplished
     within the currency for Tier 2B will satisfy both requirements. NOTE: If directed
     response times in Mission Capability (MISCAP) or Designated Occupational Capability
     (DOC) statements preclude units from completing Tier 2B training requirements on a
     “just in time” basis, the owning MAJCOM/A7S may direct this training to be completed
     on a recurring basis.
  6.4.4. Tier 3, Advanced EST (Mission Specific). Enhanced EST for select defenders as
  determined by factors including: deployment location, threat assessment, specific mission,
  duty assignment, role, operation or special requirement. Tier 3 training is focused on pre-
  deployment training that supports both traditional taskings and non-traditional USAF
  missions that support other Combatant Commanders’ taskings. Completion of this advanced
  training prepares a defender for a specific deployment tasking.
     6.4.4.1. SF RTC curriculum and the 820th Base Defense Group (BDG) training plan
     (which includes SF RTC ASO/BSO curriculum) has been certified by HQ AETC/A3Q as
     meeting the Tier-3 training requirements, outlined in AFI 36-2201. NOTE: Only
     defenders assigned to the 820 BDG may attend training at the 820 BDG. This
     organization is not authorized to operate as an RTC for members outside of its assigned
     personnel.
  6.4.5. Tier 4, Advanced EST. ES courses that are rapidly developed and fielded to train
  defenders on skill sets needed to meet critical/emerging requirements. These courses are
  often not initially well defined and are subject to rapid curriculum change. Tier 4 courses
  include those advanced training programs that are unique to a specific MAJCOM, such as the
  initial Tactical Security Element training.
  6.4.6. Integrated Defense Command and Control Course (IDC3). The IDC3 was developed
  to provide training in the knowledge and skills needed to perform a Headquarters/BDOC
  staff position.
 44                                                              AFI36-2646 13 APRIL 2012


      6.4.6.1. It is highly recommended that DFCs make every effort to have SNCOs (MSgt
      through CMSgt) and Officers (Captain through Colonel) assigned to a SF Headquarters
      UTC (QFEBA, QFEBB and QFEBS) attend the course.
      6.4.6.2. Individuals in the target grade who are not assigned to an SF Headquarters UTC
      may also attend the course as determined by the parent MAJCOM/A7S and availability
      of unfilled seats.
      6.4.6.3. Refer to the ETCA website for course specifics.
   6.4.7. Combat Leaders Course (CLC). The CLC was developed to provide training in the
   knowledge and skills needed to perform in an SF Squad Leader position.
      6.4.7.1. It is highly recommended that DFCs make every effort to have NCOs (SrA with
      a promotion line number or SSgt-TSgt) assigned to an SF Squad Leader position attend
      this course.
      6.4.7.2. MAJCOMs will implement a selection process to manage their annual training
      quotas in this course.
      6.4.7.3. Refer to the ETCA website for course specifics.
6.5. SF Pre-deployment Training Requirement.
   6.5.1. SF who have been postured and tasked to meet known rotational expeditionary
   requirements and emerging operational requirements will receive Tier-3, mission-specific
   training at an approved SF RTC or other approved Tier-3 training site as scheduled by
   HQ AFSFC/SFOC.
   6.5.2. SF postured against a DWS UTC posturing code, but not tasked during their
   deployment vulnerability window, remain in an on-call status to reinforce forward-deployed
   forces or provide additional capability for the duration of the deployment vulnerability
   period. NOTE: DAF CPs (083) will comply with active duty requirements for EST and
   CRTs only when deploying. DAF CP/SG are exempt from EST sustainment requirements.
      6.5.2.1. These individuals must be trained and ready to deploy at a moment’s notice as
      new Combatant Commander requirements can be sourced at any time during the
      deployment period.
      6.5.2.2. SF postured against a DWS UTC posturing code, but not tasked during their
      deployment vulnerability window, will attend an approved SF RTC to receive
      standardized BSO training.
          6.5.2.2.1. MAJCOMs may increase frequency of RTC training, as seats are available
          and at their own expense.
          6.5.2.2.2. DFC will utilize these personnel to fulfill replacement requirements.
          6.5.2.2.3. SF who deploy as replacements must receive the same mission specific
          training as identified in the original deployment line remark, unless an EST
          exemption is approved IAW AFI 36-2201.
      6.5.2.3. This training will be scheduled by HQ AFSFC to coincide with their current
      assigned deployment prep window as outlined in AFI 10-401.
AFI36-2646 13 APRIL 2012                                                                   45


      6.5.2.4. Attendance at an SF RTC will be documented in the member’s AFTR by a
      trainer/supervisor. The RTC report card will be used as documentation of training
      completion.
   6.5.3. DAF CP/SG not assigned to an AEF Band, but volunteer to deploy, will train on SF
   CRT prior to arriving at an SF RTC or other Tier-3 training site. SF CRT and RTC will be
   documented in the AFTR.
   6.5.4. SF personnel who attend a Tier-3 training site per deployment line remark (such as
   Air Advisor Course or a Power Projection Platform) are not required to attend an SF RTC.
   6.5.5. Non-SF personnel assigned to SF units who are postured and/or tasked to deploy will
   complete EST requirements as outlined in AFI 36-2201.
      6.5.5.1. Members deploying with or in support of an SF mission are encouraged to train
      with their deploying team at an SF RTC.
6.6. Training Exemptions.
   6.6.1. Individual exemptions from EST. AFI 36-2201 is the governing directive for EST and
   states only individuals who have completed required training within 12 months of their
   current deployment Required Delivery Date (RDD) will be considered for an exemption from
   Tier-3, Advanced EST.
   6.6.2. Units must submit justification for exemption via memorandum to the parent
   MAJCOM/A7S for approval.
   6.6.3. If exemption is approved by MAJCOM, it will be forwarded to the HQ AFSFC/SFOC.
   6.6.4. HQ AFSFC will coordinate the exemption with AETC/A3Q (lead MAJCOM for EST)
   and AF/A3O-A (exemption approval authority).
      6.6.4.1. If approved and the individual is deploying to a hostile/uncertain environment,
      the unit will use one of the following processes based upon deployment tasking.
          6.6.4.1.1. JET/Individual Augmentee (IA) Tasking. Units will use the JET/IA CST
          Exemption Request form located on the AEF Online Air Force Reporting Instructions
          Tool page at: https://aef.afpc.randolph.af.mil/AFRIT/afrit.aspx?cat=16.
          6.6.4.1.2. Non-JET/IA Tasking. Units will use the guidance in AFI 10-403,
          Deployment Planning and Execution, to request exemption of deployment tasking
          line remarks.
 46                                                                AFI36-2646 13 APRIL 2012

   defender, enhance their warrior ethos with a technological aptitude and make them adaptive
   and innovative in delivering ID effects. This training meets Tier 3 training requirements.
       7.1.2.1. Unless otherwise directed, SF defenders will attend only AFSFC approved SF
       RTCs. SF defenders may attend other mission specific training (i.e., Provincial
       Reconstruction Teams,       Air Advisory), but will not attend Combat Airman Skills
       Training (CAST) or Advanced Combat Airman Skills Training (ACAST) to fulfill SF
       Tier 3 requirements. NOTE: HQ AFSFC is the designating authority for developing an
       SF RTC.

     influence on the RTC’s ability to perform training mission, and/or identified as critical on
     RTC Validation Checklist.
  7.6.14. Decertification.
     7.6.14.1. If the RTC validation team determines the RTC is not meeting the RTC
     training mission and ineffectively delivering the Air Force standardized RTC curriculum,
     the RTC validation team will make a recommendation to the owning MAJCOM/A7S to
     decertify operations at the affected RTC.
     7.6.14.2. Recommendation for decertification will be based upon:
         7.6.14.2.1. Failure to meet any critical item.
         7.6.14.2.2. Failure to meet 50% of non-critical items.
     7.6.14.3. The owning MAJCOM/A7S and AFSFC/CC will meet and discuss
     decertification of the RTC. If agreement cannot be made on an outcome of the RTC
     decertification, a package will be staffed to HAF/A7S for a decision.

     Commander or equivalent and the HQ AFSFC/CC of decertification.
     7.6.14.6. HQ AFSFC will no longer schedule classes at the decertified location and it
     will be the HQ AFSFC’s responsibility to determine scheduling courses of action for
     existing and future classes.
     7.6.14.7. MAJCOM and RTC will collaborate and establish a recertification timeline
     based upon the observations. Owning MAJCOM will provide the recertification timeline
     to HQ AFSFC within 60 days of decertification.
  7.6.15. Impact Considerations.
     7.6.15.1. HQ AFSFC/CC will make the determination for long term impact of a
     decertified curriculum or RTC.
AFI36-2646 13 APRIL 2012                                                                   61


  7.6.16. Contracted Functions Validation.
     7.6.16.1. Validation Areas. Assess and rate contracted functions against Performance
     Work Statements (PWS) or Statement of Work (SOW). The PWS or SOW will be
     assessed for adequacy to ensure it meets mission requirements.
     7.6.16.2. Rating and Reporting. Contracted functions will be rated; however, individual
     contractors will not. Sampling of contracted activity will be coordinated through the
     Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE). Contractors may be provided with applicable
     portions of the report IAW DoD Regulation 5400.7/Air Force Supplement, DoD
     Freedom of Information Act Program.
     7.6.16.3. Validation. Validate observations related to contractor functions with the QAE

     7.6.17.1. Validation Team will complete a formal report within 30 days of validation
     visit and forward a copy to owning MAJCOM/A7S and HQ AFSFC/CC. The report will
     be approved by both prior to release to the RTC.
     7.6.17.2. Each Validation Report will be assigned a unique tracking number by
     HQ AFSFC/SFOC.
     7.6.17.3. The Validation Report will describe, in sufficient detail, the deficiency and
     contextual facts as necessary, to clearly convey deficiencies requiring resolution. The
     written description alone should be adequate for the validation party to begin corrective
     action planning. Final reports will be maintained by HQ AFSFC/SFOC and reviewed by
     AETC/A3Q during the annual RTC Tier 3 validation.

      EXAMPLE TRAINING, EXERCISE AND EVALUATION OUTLINE (TEEO).

UNIT: (Type of unit engaged in exercise/evaluation, i.e., Response Force, Fire Team).

MISSION: (Provide a brief description of the mission, i.e., Convoy Operations).

TASK(S): (List the task(s) to be evaluated).

CONDITION: (The condition associated with the evaluated task).

STANDARD: (The standard associated with the evaluated task).

Evaluator/Unit: (Self-explanatory).

Date: (Self-Explanatory).

1. GENERAL CONDITIONS: (Provide a brief description of the scenario).

2. PRIMARY EXERCISE TRAINING AND EVALUATION STANDARDS: (Provide an
explanation of the standards to be met in order to achieve a passing grade/rating and how the
standards are to be measured. TEEO developers may also provide an explanation of intangible
items that may contribute to successful accomplishment of the task or tasks, for example,
command and control, communication, tactics, etc).

3. TRAINING EXERCISE AND EVALUATION RESULTS: (Provide instructions for
trainers/evaluators/controllers on how to document evaluation results, i.e., Check "G" [Go] or
"N" [No-Go] in the space provided on the following pages of this outline to indicate the unit's
performance on each task. Trainers/evaluators/exercise controllers should record other important
information on the back of the outline).

4. SUGGESTED SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS:

a. Administration. (Outline instructions for trainers/evaluators/controllers on any administrative
functions needed to carry out the exercise/evaluation. Some things to consider are safety and
coordination with affected units such as providing exercise start cards and copies of TEEO to the
BDOC).

b. Minimum evaluators. (Provide a description of the composition of the exercise/evaluation
team. The size, makeup and positioning of the team should be adequate to cover all aspects of
the exercise/evaluation).

c. Opposing forces. (Provide the details for opposing forces. Among things to consider are team
composition, equipment, position, and tactics, techniques and procedures to be used).

d. Support personnel. (List any support personnel needed and the duties they will perform).
AFI36-2646 13 APRIL 2012                                                                         71



e. Exercise area. (Provide a description of the area to be used. The area should be of sufficient
size to allow the unit to carry out the task(s) and should also resemble the environment where the
team will be performing its mission(s) as much as possible).

f. Firing area. None.

g. Training aids, devices and special equipment. (List any items needed to support the
exercise/evaluation. Some examples are listed below).

(1) If available, use approved dye marking cartridges or Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement
System (MILES) or similar system for both the RF and opposing forces.

(2) If available, use light attenuating devices for training in limited visibility situations.

(3) In actual night exercises, both response forces and opposing forces personnel should wear
night vision devices, if available.

(4) Ammunition. Issue the following to both forces:

(a) 5.56mm, blank, 60 rounds per M16 series weapon (M16A2/GAU/M4).

(b) 5.56mm, blank, 200 rounds per M249 or M240B machine gun.

(5) Smoke canister (if appropriate).

(6) If using MILES, follow the rules in the Air Force Handbooks or in the MILES exercise
booklet.

(7) Marking cartridges.

(8) Key references. AFHs, AFI 31-101 Integrated Defense, and Marking Cartridge CONOPS.

5. CONSIDERATIONS: (List any considerations that will contribute to a safe but successful
exercise/evaluation. Some examples are listed below).

a. If MILES is not available, one trainer or evaluator should be with opposing forces to allow the
trainer or evaluator to see how well the response force uses available cover and concealment, as
well as proper fire and maneuver techniques.

b. The use of marking cartridges is authorized but is not required. Marking cartridges can add a
high degree of realism, but can create a safety risk. If used, strict compliance with the guidance
and safety procedures in the CONOPS provided on the HQ AFSFC website will be followed.
Safety is critical and must be considered and built into every phase of training. Scenarios will be
stopped immediately if any safety violation occurs.

c. Trainers, evaluators and exercise directors must not interfere with the exercise, or by their
position, alert either side of the opponent's movements.

d. In training, players will serve as controllers or evaluators. Being a player in one exercise and
an evaluator in another reinforces tactical training principles.

e. Safety procedures must be briefed before the exercise starts. The briefing must include:

(1) Weapons safety.

(a) Never play with your weapon, or perform any gestures with your weapon that would cause a
safety concern or issue.

(b) The safe use of blanks, if used. Briefing should include safe engagement distance and proper
use/installation of blank firing adapters.

(c) The safe use of marking cartridges when used. Briefing should include safe engagement
distances, any prohibited engagement areas, the use of protective equipment and do’s and don’ts
of using marking cartridges.

(2) Use of Force.

(3) Vehicle safety.

(a) Speed limits.

(b) Local driving hazards.

(c) Vehicle limitations and handling characteristics.

(d) Driving in/around the flight line and aircraft parking areas.

(4) Ground Safety.

(5) Any locally unique hazards, state or host nation restrictions.

(6) Evaluators and controllers must be able to immediately stop exercises in progress for safety
violations.

                                       CORE TASKS FOR SELECT S-3/FLIGHT DUTY POSITIONS.

A4.1. This table mandates the minimum core tasks required for Installation Entry Controller, SF
Patrol and Flight Sergeant/Commander. The below tasks (most from the 3P0X1 CFETP STS)
will be identified in the work center MTL as being required for these duty positions; this will
ensure SF performing in these duty positions, regardless of location, receive standardized duty
position training. NOTE: Per AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, Attachment 13, the
CFETP will be the core document of the MTL; all other mandated duty position tasks (local or
otherwise) will be documented on an AF Form 797.
