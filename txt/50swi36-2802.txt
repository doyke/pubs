SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision created a separate
chapter that governs the Contractor Quarterly/Annual Awards Program, changed the Unit Nomination
Letter, changes submission timelines, changed the scoresheet, defines the requirements for First Sergeant
of the Year, changed headings of awards from five to three for active duty, changed the headings from five
to one for civilians, changed quarterly award spacing to single space between sub bullets and double
space between main bullets, changed scoring process to a 6-10 whole-person concept system and changed
the maximum number of lines of justification for quarterly awards.
General: This program is a means of formally recognizing personnel who have demonstrated through job
performance, special achievements, and contributions to their local communities that they warrant special
recognition. Nominees are representative of a quality force and therefore must be able to stand the test of
“whole life/whole career” scrutiny. Entries in the AF Form 1206, Nomination for Award, will address
events that occurred during the award period only. All nominees are eligible except those who have been
subject to judicial or nonjudicial punishment, unfavorable information file, control roster action, weight

     pt. with 1 inch margins. Must be complete sentences and no more than 5 lines. This information will

     3.7.2. Nomination Packages. Packages for contractors will be handled by the 50 CONS/CC in the fol-
     lowing manner:
        3.7.2.1. Government contractor personnel perform functions that are an integral component in the
        success of the Schriever Air Force Base mission. The intent of this section is to recognize out-
        standing performance by incorporating government contractors into our Quarterly and Annual
        Awards Program. However, the government will not be involved in any way in the selection of
        contractor award winners. The intent of this section is to simply provide a forum for contractor
        personnel to receive an award. The success of this initiative will be dependent upon the contrac-
        tors, specifically, the members of the contractor awards review board.
        3.7.2.2. All government contractors who hold prime contracts or subcontracts at Schriever AFB
        are eligible to nominate employees in the contractor categories. Each contractor is limited to one
        nomination from his or her company in each category per period. The contractor package should
        reflect the accomplishments, which show the outstanding performance of the individual or team.
        A contractor awards review board, consisting of a representative from each prime contractor (one
        for each group and one for tenant organizations), will be established to review these nominations
        to choose one contractor personnel award recipient per category for each group and tenant units. A
        wing contractor review board, consisting of a representative from five prime contractors, will be
        established to select the wing contractor of the quarter in each category.

3.8. Submission Timelines.
     3.8.1. Contractors at Schriever AFB will use their own methods for selection of nominees. Competi-
     tive categories and submission timeliness must adhere to the provisions of this directive to compete
     for Schriever AFB awards.
     3.8.2. Contractors will provide nomination packages to their respective group or tenant contractor
     awards review board by the second Tuesday in April, July, October, and January.
     3.8.3. Quarterly Awards. The contractor chairperson will provide the nomination packages to 50 SW/
     CCA by the 15th of April, July, October, and January.
     3.8.4. Annual Awards. Due dates will be determined by the 50 SW/CCC.

3.9. Program Responsibilities. 50 SW/CCA

     GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING VOLUNTEER RECOGNITION PROGRAM

4.1. Volunteer Recognition. The Family Support Center (FSC) is the OPR for volunteer the recognition
program. Specific questions, guidance, and information can be obtained from the FSC staff. This guid-
ance is general in nature and covers basic nomination and process procedures.

4.2. Purpose: The purpose of the Volunteer Recognition program is to recognize volunteer efforts and to
publicize opportunities. Nominations can be submitted at any time to the FSC. They will be reviewed and
used to catalog and record volunteer programs, efforts and results of personnel, and to aid in publicizing
through web pages, base publications, and other means, program and individual results. The AFSPC/CC
has designated that volunteer effort should be recorded in base publications thereby highlighting the pro-
grams and personal results. Use of this program will aid in providing our people with avenues to find out
where to employ their efforts, recognition of their efforts, and cataloging of programs both on-base and in
the local community.

4.3. Categories: Military (assigned and tenant), civilian, or defense contractor. All military, civilian, and
contractor personnel working on Schriever AFB or assigned GSUs are eligible for this recognition. Super-
visors may nominate personnel through their unit commanders to ensure quality force checks on military
personnel and the worthiness of nominations. Defense contractor personnel are eligible to participate with
nominations being routed through the contractor consortium to base contracting for review, and then to
the FSC for award of certificate of recognition.

4.4. Nominating official: Supervisor. All nominations must be routed through and approved by unit
commander or staff agency head to ensure quality force issues are met. Defense contractor personnel
nominations must be routed through 50 CONS prior to submission to ensure no contract problems are
incurred. Supervisors, Commanders and directors are responsible for any time off, incentive, or other
awards. The primary intent of this program is to provide recognition for people’s volunteerism and to
highlight available programs.

4.5. Qualification Criteria: Nominees must have performed service on a voluntary basis, while sta-
tioned at Schriever AFB or associated GSU. Cited accomplishments must have occurred during the period
to which the award pertains. All volunteer efforts count, both on- and off base. Example: Work in a school
program helping kids study after duty hours or during a time when commander has designated time off.

4.6. Recognition Periods: Volunteer recognition can be for any period of time or for a specific event if
deemed worthy of award. Supervisors (nominating official) should include all pertinent information in
nomination submission (see example). Submissions may be made to the FSC at any time.

4.7. Nominating procedure: Nominations should be typed and formatted in sync with Attachment 1
example. No specific length is required. Specify as much information as necessary to highlight the pro-
gram and the specific results achieved by the individual.

4.8. Quarterly Recognition of Recipients: Personnel recommended for this recognition, with concur-
rence of the FSC staff, can be recognized and presented a certificate of appreciation as a part of an appro-
50SWI36-2802 26 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                            19


priate squadron, group, or wing ceremony or other ceremony established by the FSC staff. The FSC staff
will coordinate presentation with squadron commanders or staff agency, contractor personnel and assist
with presentation as deemed appropriate. All personnel selected will be recognized with an appropriate
memento and certificate. Contractor personnel, are only able to, and will only receive a certificate of rec-
ognition only.

4.9. Selection Process : Nominations will be reviewed by FSC staff to ensure they meet volunteerism
criteria.

4.10. Annual Recognition of Volunteer Service Medal Recipients : Recommendation and approval of
the Military Volunteer Service Medal (MVOSM) rests with unit and group commanders. In order to rec-
ognize recipients of the medal, and to highlight accomplishments of military members receiving this rec-
ognition, members will be recognized at an appropriate wing or other level ceremony (Example could be
the 50th Space Wing, Annual Awards Ceremony). Recipients will be presented the medal or ceremoni-
ously re-presented the medal at the ceremony. This will be done to increase visibility of volunteer efforts
and results of wing personnel.

        Achiever Award.

ment gifts.
50SWI36-2802 26 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                        21


5.4. Nomination Procedures. Any commander or supervisor may nominate an individual or small group

5.5. Criteria. The criteria to receive the Gold Achiever Award are broad. However, commanders should
limit their awards to those who have gone above and beyond the normal call of duty. The award can be
given to superior performers who were instrumental in ensuring mission accomplishment, but should be
awarded sparingly for a one-time, nonrecurring event (e.g., the top 1% of “Outstanding Performers” iden-
tified during an inspection).

5.6. Award determination. The appropriate commander approves or disapproves all nominations for
their level of award using the following guidelines:
   5.6.1. Did the nominee perform or make an effort to perform above and beyond the normal call of
   duty?
   5.6.2. Was the nominee’s superior performance a major contributing factor to a one-time, non-recur-
   ring event?

5.7. 50th Space Wing Commander and Command Chief Master Sergeant Recognition Coins . The
50 SW/CC and the 50 SW/CCC may present recognition coins to individuals who deserve on-the-spot
recognition for performing in an outstanding manner and improving the overall mission success of the
50th Space Wing.

 A10.1. Each board member should score each nominee package using the appropriate score sheet. After
 scoring is complete, each board member should rank order the nominee packages, assigning a ranking
 based on the nominee’s score. For instance, if there are five nominees, each board member will assign a
 rank 1 through 5, with 1 being the best. The rankings are then added together to get your total. The lowest
 total is the winner. For example a nominee received a 1, 1, 1, 2, and 3. His total would be 8. If this were
 the lowest total he would be the winner.

 A10.2. In instances where there are tie scores on the score sheet, the board member must break the tie.

 A10.3. In the instance where there are tie scores on the ranking sheet, the president must add in her or her
 scores to determine the winner.

                                   BOARD MEMBER’S GUIDANCE

A11.1. Board members are not to discuss their scored packages with anyone, expect other board members
or president during the board period, until after the awards ceremony. Do not reveal who won until after
the 50th Space Wing Commander or Vice Commander announces the winners.

A11.2. Members must be fair and impartial. Set aside any bias (positive or negative) and evaluate the
packages based on the substance of the write-ups. The AF Form 1206 consists of 21 lines with 3 heading.
Headings do not count towards the 21 lines. Quality and impact of the accomplishments are important, not
the quantity. Please keep in mind it is not the “importance” of one’s job you’re rating, but what the indi-
vidual did within their job.

A11.3. You should compare the accomplishments of each nominee and then score accordingly using the
score sheet provided. Pay careful attention to the category criteria. Filler and fluff do not count for any-
thing. They actually detract from the write-up. Things to look for in each category are listed below:
     A11.3.1. JOB PERFORMANCE IN PRIMARY DUTY (Enlisted, CGO & Civilians)
     The member’s leadership and job performance in their primary duty, including the development of
     new techniques, must have contributed significantly to increase mission effectiveness during the cal-
     endar quarter/year. You should be looking for individual accomplishments that impacted the unit.
     A11.3.2. SIGNIFICANT SELF-IMPROVEMENT (Enlisted & CGO)
     The member must have shown this improvement through off-duty education, achievements in profes-
     sional or cultural societies or associations, development of creative abilities, and so on during the
     award period. Includes military and civilian classes, professional development, self-development, etc.
     In general, self-improvement that is voluntary carries more weight than just attending a mandatory
     class the individual was scheduled for.
     A11.3.3. BASE OR COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT (Enlisted & CGO)
     The member must have contributed tangibly or intangibly to the military or civilian community’s wel-
     fare, morale, or status during the calendar year. This includes base/squadron/community involvement
     such as Top-3, booster club, coach of a youth athletic team, scout leader, church elder, etc. Being a
     member of an organization is not as strong as being in a leadership position (president, secretary,
     coach, team leader, head organizer, etc.).

A11.4. This is an important program for our people. Give the packages the time and effort they deserve.
When you’re finished, set them aside. If you have time, take another look later and adjust as necessary.

A11.5. Once you have an established score for each nominee, identify the highest rated nominee with a
“1”, the second with a “2”, etc. No ties are allowed. If you have two packages that are very close you
must decide which to rate higher. (Remember this is a “whole person” program and you are selecting who
you think will best represent the organization using the scoring criteria.)

A11.6. Relative rankings from each board member will be added together to determine the winner. Low
score is the winner.

A11.7. Do not reveal who won until after the winners have been announced.

                                BOARD PRESIDENT’S GUIDANCE

A12.1. This guidance is to assist the president in ensuring the board runs smoothly and professionally.
Quarterly/Annual board members are under orders not to discuss their scored packages with anyone until
after the awards ceremony. Winners' names are only to be released by 50th Space Wing Commander, Vice
Commander or Command Chief Master Sergeant.

A12.2. Ensure you know the ranks, names, and units of your fellow board members.

A12.3. Ensure the nominees’ ranks and names are written on the score sheets that are provided in your
board’s packages. Setup a time to meet with your board members. Explain the criteria for review of pack-
ages. Members are to focus on the information listed on the AF Form 1206 and grade packages accord-
ingly. The amount of information provided is not the determining factor. The quality of information
provided for the period being considered is paramount. Remind members to be fair and consistent in their
scoring.

A12.4. Check the raw scores, and rack and stack packages for each nominee.

A12.5. Once the board is finished scoring their nominations, board members need to date and sign score
sheets, turn in their folders along with the score sheets to the president. The board president will then
transfer the information to the board president score sheet and sign it.

A12.6. Thank members for their participation and efforts in making our recognition program a successful
one.
