Guard (ANG) on Title 10 status, and AFSOC-gained Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units
only upon mobilization. In the event AFSOC guidance conflicts with ANG or AFRC guidance,
units will follow the ANG or AFRC guidance until gained by AFSOC (i.e. after mobilization).
ANG/AFRC units that support active associate units will ensure SORTS reporting is
accomplished according to this supplement whenever active associate unit resources are
involved and they are reporting on any asset owned by the active component. All guidance for
SORTS reporting will be issued solely by HQ AFSOC/A3OR. Ensure that all records created as
a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force
Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air

                                           Chapter 1

                                SORTS GENERAL POLICY

1.1. SORTS. SORTS is an internal management tool for use by the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), Services, Unified Commands, and Combat Support Agencies. It is the
single automated reporting system within the Department of Defense (DoD) functioning as the
central registry of all operational units of the US Armed Forces and certain foreign
organizations. SORTS has a threefold purpose: it provides data critical to crisis planning,
provides for the deliberate or peacetime planning process, and is used by the Chief of Staff
United States Air Force (CSAF) and subordinate commanders in assessing their effectiveness in
meeting Title 10, “United States Code,‖ responsibilities to organize, train, and equip forces for
combatant commands. All units with a United States Air Force (USAF) Personnel Accounting
Symbol (PAS) code will be registered in SORTS.
   1.1.1. As a monitoring system of measured units and resources, SORTS indicates the
   C-level of selected resources and training status required to undertake the full mission set
   for which a unit was organized or designed. It also collects and distributes Service-unique
   information regarding a measured unit.
   1.1.2. The Air Force (AF) uses SORTS status information in assessing readiness,
   determining budgetary allocation and management action impacts on unit level readiness,
   answering congressional inquiries, analyzing readiness trends, and supporting readiness
   decisions.
   1.1.3. SORTS provides broad bands of information on selected unit status indicators which
   include the commander’s assessment of the unit’s ability to execute the mission set for
   which it is organized or designed. Measurement criteria is designed and developed by
   Functional Area Managers (FAM) to provide valid assessments regarding unit readiness.
   Commanders, or their designated alternates, assess measurements against their mission set
   to determine if they provide a realistic indication of the unit’s readiness. It is critical that
   reporting commanders identify those areas that are rated less than desired in order to
   promote and justify corrective action (including funding, personnel and equipment
   allocations.).
       1.1.3.1. SORTS is not designed to function as a detailed information management
       system objectively counting all conceivable variables regarding personnel, training, and
       logistics.
       1.1.3.2. SORTS is not designed to be used as input for the performance appraisal of a
       unit or a unit commander.
           1.1.3.2.1. SORTS indicates a unit’s ability to undertake their full mission
           (Primary DOC Statement) or particular mission(s) (Secondary or Tertiary DOC
           Statements).
           1.1.3.2.2. SORTS may also provide indications of the efficacy of resource
           allocation decisions and the impacts of budgetary constraints on resourcing unit
           requirements.
10                                             AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009


        1.1.3.3. A fundamental premise of SORTS reporting is integrity. Commanders must ―tell
        it like it is‖ (in accordance with (IAW) paragraphs 1.10.7 and 1.10.8) and not allow
        masking of deficiencies to affect their ability to provide capability or other readiness
        related information. Risk must be balanced with responsibility. Effective management of
        unit resources requires accurate information at all levels.
     1.1.4. When deployed/employed in response to a crisis or operations order (OPORD),
     SORTS provides both an assessment of a unit’s status based on ability to execute the mission
     set for which it was organized or designed and, when appropriate, the mission against which
     it is employed.
     1.1.5. Records Maintenance. Records prescribed by this instruction will be maintained
     IAW Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule.
     1.1.6. In the event of conflict between this AFI and MAJCOM Supplements or Unit DOCs,
     AFI guidance will take precedence. Concerned parties will contact the HQ USAF/XOOA
     office for resolution.
        1.1.6.1. (Added-AFSOC) AFSOC units will contact HQ AFSOC/A3OR prior to
        contacting HQ USAF/A3O-AOBR (HAF SORTS). All change requests to tables in
        AFI 10-201 or this supplement must be in written form and signed by the Functional
        Area Manager (FAM) Directorate. Provide a hard and soft copy of the request to
        HQ AFSOC/A3OR. HQ AFSOC/A3OR will forward requests to HAF SORTS.
1.2. Measured Units Reporting Requirement. Measured units are all planned and actual
(JTF) HQs, combat, combat support, combat services support units including Active, Air
National Guard, AF Reserves and provisional units apportioned to or deployed in support
of a CJCS or combatant command-directed OPLAN, Concept Plans, SIOP, Operations Plan
8044 Revision 03 or Volume 3 of the USAF War and Mobilization Plan (WMP-3), or assigned
in the ―Forces For Unified Commands‖ document. Measured units will be named on a DOC
Statement (DOCS) and must report SORTS in accordance with their DOCS. One exception is
training units that report only Major Equipment Location and Crew Information (MEQLOCN).
Measured unit SORTS reporting begins as soon as possible after a unit activates and continues
until the unit deactivates.
     1.2.1. Provisional and task organized combat, combat support and combat service support
     units are also designated as measured units. The Service component or Combatant
     Commander (CC) directing the establishment of a measured unit will determine the
     organizational reporting structure of the unit.
     1.2.2. Air Force measured units may include any units registered in SORTS. Registered units
     include PAS coded units, fragments of PAS coded units and composite units such as fleets
     (e.g., airlift, tanker, etc.). Composite reports are in addition to and do not replace normal
     measured unit SORTS reporting requirements.
     1.2.3. SORTS measurement baseline. Regardless of the source of a unit's tasking or the
     extent of unit capability tasked in OPLANS, etc., SORTS measurement is based on the unit's
     full wartime requirement for which it was organized or designed. This baseline is reflected
     in the definition of C-1. This baseline can exceed the unit's OPLAN tasking(s). To fulfill
     this measurement requirement, the unit's primary DOC Statement must include the
     maximum tasking(s), including both in-place and mobility wartime missions, the unit can
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                         11


  simultaneously support within its current resource authorizations. When properly updated
  with a unit’s complete in-place and mobility tasking(s), the AFWUS is a single source
  reference for a unit's designed capability. Units are required to measure and report on all
  resources identified on their DOC Statement(s) even if the resources are not yet delivered
  (e.g., equipment for a newly assigned UTC) or if it is not possible to accomplish a task, such
  as small arms qualification. If required, waivers for SORTS reporting must to be
  coordinated through HQ USAF/ XOOA.
     1.2.3.1. Personnel Measurement Baseline.
         1.2.3.1.1. Primary, secondary and tertiary DOC Statement reports. The baseline for
         measuring personnel is the unit's full wartime requirement for personnel based on
         either Unit Manning Document (UMD) authorizations or UTC requirements.
         See paragraph 3.1. Training is not measured in the personnel measured area.
         1.2.3.1.2. CBDRT reports used in SORTS do not report the personnel measured
         area. See Attachment 4.
     1.2.3.2. Equipment and Supplies O/H Measurement Baseline.
         1.2.3.2.1. Primary, secondary and tertiary DOC Statement reports. The baseline for
         measuring equipment and supplies is the unit's full wartime requirement for the
         items being measured. The required numbers for the items are based on
         authorization documents such as Allowance Standards (AS), Air Staff-level
         functional area guidance, MRSP lists, equipment and supplies lists, or UTC
         requirements, depending on the unit's mission(s). See Chapter 4. Equipment
         condition is normally not to be measured in the Equipment and Supplies
         O/H measured area.
         1.2.3.2.2. CBDRT reports used in SORTS will base the equipment and supplies
         O/H area on the unit's full wartime requirement for the equipment items and the
         condition of the items being measured. See Attachment 4.
     1.2.3.3. Equipment Condition Measurement Baseline.
         1.2.3.3.1. Primary, secondary and tertiary DOC Statement reports. The Equipment
         Condition measured area measures the condition of possessed equipment and
         supplies. See Chapter 5.
         1.2.3.3.2. CBDRT reports used in SORTS include equipment condition
         measurements in the equipment and supplies O/H measured area. See Attachment 4.
     1.2.3.4. Training Measurement Baseline.
         1.2.3.4.1. Primary, secondary and tertiary DOC Statement reports. The baseline for
         measuring training is the personnel assigned to the unit that require the training
         event or category being measured. See Chapter 6.
         1.2.3.4.2. CBDRT reports used in SORTS measure training in the training
         measured area. Measured training is based on the unit's full wartime requirement of
         personnel for the training event or category being measured. See Attachment 4.

1.3. Frequency of SORTS Reporting. All measured units (Active, Reserve, and Guard) will
continuously monitor changes in the overall unit level, resource category levels, and unit
location. Units must report no later than every 30 days (in order for messages to process by the
mandated 31 day maximum) or when changes affect the unit’s Overall C-level, the four
measured area levels, associated reason codes, deployed reason codes, get well/get worse date
changes, and when desired by the measured unit commander. See Chapter 2, paragraph 2.4,
for further information.
     1.3.1. Command Reporting Organizations (CRO) submit waiver requests for reporting
     requirements or changes to reporting frequency through HQ USAF/XOOA to the Joint Staff
     (JS). Units submit their waiver requests to their CRO.
     1.3.2. Composite/aggregate unit reports must be received within 96 hours of the oldest
     individual unit’s; Report Date of Change of Category Information (RICDA).
     1.3.3. If unit status has not changed since the last report an OVERALL set must be
     submitted to reflect an updated RICDA date and any remarks in the database will be updated
     with the current date.
1.4. SORTS Data Classification. Executive Order (EO) 12958, ―Classified National Security
Information,‖ requires us to protect classified information while striking a balance between
protection and the need to inform the American public of their governmental activities. Also,
this EO increases and emphasizes personal responsibility for classification and declassification
decisions. The procedures for classification and marking of classified documents are
specified in DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program, DoD 5200.1-PH, DoD Guide to
Marking Classified Documents; and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management.‖
     1.4.1. Derivative Classification. Derivative classification is the incorporating, paraphrasing,
     restating, or generating, in a new form, already classified information and marking newly
     developed material consistent with the classification that applies to the source information.
     1.4.2. Derivative Classifier. Persons applying derivative classification markings must carry
     forward to any newly created document the classification markings from the original source.
     1.4.3. SORTS Readiness Data. Measured area category levels, overall category levels,
     numbers used to compute percentages and the percentages (when associated with SORTS),
     reason codes associated with their remarks, and limiting factors for a single unit, are, at a
     minimum, classified CONFIDENTIAL. Products that contain data from two or more
     measured units is classified SECRET NOFORN. Additionally, individuals classifying
     SORTS reports must consider other classification guidance including OPLANS. The
     association of the unit with its OPLAN(s) tasking is classified at the level of classification
     of the OPLAN(s), usually SECRET. Information that is not SORTS based and does not
     show a deficiency may still require classification through channels other than SORTS. Unit
     and Wing Security Managers should be consulted in these events.
        1.4.3.1. SORTS Worksheets/Briefing Slides reflecting measured unit data, as described
        above, will be given the same classification level as the material from which it was
        derived. Although sources (worksheets, e-mails, etc.) used to compile a unit’s SORTS
        data may be unclassified, once compiled and associated with SORTS ratings, it becomes
        classified at the highest level associated with the data (see Table 1.3).
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                           13


          1.4.3.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) When grouping multiple documents in the same binder,
          folder, etc., ensure each individual page is marked with the highest classification
          contained on that page and the binder or folder is marked with the highest
          classification of any document contained therein. For further information and detail,
          refer to DOD 5200.1-R, Chapter 5. Note: If an item is unclassified, it must be
          marked accordingly.
       1.4.3.2. Aggregate SORTS data will be classified at the same or higher level as the
       highest classified component parts or segments of SORTS data. SORTS data converted
       to a new type information must be evaluated for its impact on national security if
       released. See Table 1.3 for further guidance.
       1.4.3.3. C-5 Authorization messages (giving that a unit is authorized to, not that they are
       reporting C-5) are Unclassified provided notification does not contain the unit’s current
       C-level (C1-5) or specific information, e.g., limiting factors, operational plans, etc.
   1.4.4. Classification Authority. The JS SORTS database is classified SECRET. Information
   extracted from this database is classified IAW CJCSM 3150.02, ―Global Status of Resources
   and Training System (GSORTS),‖ and must contain derivative classification markings
   consistent with DoD 5200.1R, except where authorized otherwise. Derivative
   classification rules apply when extracts contain exempted data. If no classified source
   exists, use CJCSM 3150.02 as classification authority. Use "Derived From: CJCSM
   3150.02, Global Status of Resources and Training System (GSORTS), Declassify On:
   (date)‖ to mark material when this reference is used as classification guidance. The date of
   declassification is four years from the date of the document for CONFIDENTIAL and eight
   years for SECRET. If other sources direct a classification higher or for a longer period, list
   the classification guidance as the authority and list the specific sources on the file copy.
   1.4.5. Downgrading Authority. Initial downgrading of SORTS data and aggregate
   information will be determined by CJCS. The HQ USAF Deputy Chief of Staff, Air and
   Space Operations (HQ USAF/ XO) is the authority to extend or accelerate downgrading
   classification of SORTS data following an initial determination by CJCS.
1.5. Releasing SORTS Data to Outside Agencies. CJCSI 5714.01, ―Release Procedures for
Joint Staff and Joint Papers and Information,‖ sets the policy for release of SORTS data to
agencies not on original distribution.
   1.5.1. Policy: All holders of SORTS data must take action to protect against unauthorized
   disclosure and to preserve the statutory relationship of the CJCS, as principal military
   adviser, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) as military advisors to the Secretary of Defense
   (SECDEF). Authorized holders of AF SORTS data can release it only to military
   components, or assigned or apportioned units, with a valid need-to-know and appropriate
   clearance. Exceptions to this policy must be coordinated through HQ USAF/XOOA.
14                                              AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009


     1.5.2. Specific policies for auditors, the Congress, and the general public: Auditors and
     inspectors of the General Accounting Office (GAO) or the Office of the DoD Inspector
     General (IG) have legal authority under Public Laws 96-226 and 97-252 for access. Only
     the President and SecDef can deny final access. Refer denial proposals to HQ USAF/XOOA
     for submission to the JS.
        1.5.2.1. Release data to Congress and its committees, staff, and investigators according
        to DoD Directive 5400.4, ―Provision of Information to the Congress.‖
        1.5.2.2. Responses to requests for SORTS data from the public under provisions of the
        Freedom of Information Act must be coordinated with HQ USAF SORTS, JS, and the
        Freedom of Information Act processing office.
     1.5.3. Preferred Methods for Release. Only the minimum amount of information will be
     released to satisfy a request. Preferred methods in rank order are:
        1.5.3.1. Access to a specific part or parts of the database in a controlled environment.
        1.5.3.2. Access to a major subset or the entire database in a controlled environment.
        1.5.3.3. Release of a specific part or parts of the database or minor subset.
        1.5.3.4. Release of a major subset of the entire database.
1.6. Information Reported in SORTS.
     1.6.1. Reported Unit Identification Code (RPTDUIC) set. This set establishes the identity
     of each individual reporting unit by their Unit Identity Code (UIC).
     1.6.2. Basic Identity Data Element (BIDE) set. Set applies to all registered units, includes
     the Unit Descriptor Code (UDC), unit abbreviated name (ANAME), UTC, Unit Level
     Code (ULC), Major Command (MJCOM for BIDE) under which the unit is organized, and
     unit Long Name (LNAME). Only CROs (MAJCOM SORTS office or equivalent) report this
     data.
     1.6.3. Reporting Organization (RPTNORG), Losing Organization (LOSING), Gaining
     Organization (GAINING), and Transfer Status (TRANSFER) sets. The RPTNORG set
     includes each unit’s CRO (Reporting Organization UIC (RPTOR) field) and Subordinate
     Reporting Unit (SBRPT). Only CROs report LOSING, GAINING, and TRANSFER sets to
     manage unit reporting organizations.
     1.6.4. General Status Organization and Location (ORGLOCN). ORGLOCN applies to all
     registered units, includes codes for CC/Service Command (CSERV), commands with
     Operational Control (OPCON), Administrative Control (ADCON), unit’s Home
     Geographical Location (HOGEO) and Present Geographical Location (PRGEO), Activity
     Code (ACTIV), and Percent Effective (PCTEF). Only CROs report this data with the
     exception of PCTEF, which is reported by the measured unit.
     1.6.5. Reserve Component Organization Status (RESERVES) set. Includes duty location,
     activity, mobilization or call-up date, and gaining command for units mobilized. HQ Air
     Force Reserve Command (HQ AFRC) and the National Guard Bureau (NGB) report this
     data according to CJCSM 3150.02.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                          15


   1.6.6. Personnel Strength Status (PERSTREN) set. The Air Force reports wartime
   authorized, assigned, possessed, deployable, and tasked deployable strengths. Unit
   authorizations are maintained by the MAJCOM and in the UMD. MAJCOMs will provide
   guidance for units to identify wartime personnel authorizations. In peacetime, the Air Force
   Personnel Center (AFPC) reports assigned and available data. When CJCS directs an
   increased reporting frequency, measured units report personnel strength status as directed.
   1.6.7. Resources and Training Status (Type of Report (TREAD), OVERALL,
   PERSONNEL, Equipment Supplies O/H (EQSUPPLY), Equipment Condition
   (EQCONDN), TRAINING, FORECAST, Category Limit (CATLIM) and Remarks fields.
   Fields apply to all measured units that report status for one or more DOC Statements.
   SORTS DOC Statements (AF Form (AFF) 723 or approved facsimile) summarize and
   provide source information for the mission(s) for which the unit is organized or designed.
   All unit SORTS data is available to all authorized Global Command and Control System
   (GCCS) GSORTS customers. While there are exceptions, Unified Commanders and the JS
   primarily look to joint data elements (Overall C-level and reason code, the four measured area
   levels and reason codes, and the associated remarks). AF FAMs look at detailed data,
   analyze information for trends, and direct appropriate actions in response to lowered
   C-levels.
       1.6.7.1. Plain language supplemental remarks can be reported for any SORTS data field
       that contains information. These remarks are a critical component of the SORTS report
       and are frequently used as a management tool.
       1.6.7.2. Remarks are allowed in the database through 3 increments of
       2000 + 2000 + 1000 characters for a maximum total of 5000 characters per remark. On
       rare occasions a remark may be limited to 2000 or less characters.
   1.6.8. Major Equipment Location and Crew Status (MEQLOCN) set. MEQLOCN is
   reported in unit SORTS reports for those units possessing major equipment (aircraft,
   missiles, etc.). This set includes major equipment (MEQPT) and crew status at a unit's present
   and deployed locations. See Attachment 5 for further guidance.
       1.6.8.1. (Added-AFSOC) When submitting Major Equipment Location and Crew
       Status data (MEQLOCN), AFSOC units will only utilize the MEPSA, MEPSD,
       MEORC, CREWA, CREWF and CRMRC fields to depict readiness status. Units must
       pay particular attention to detail to ensure accuracy.
          1.6.8.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) In the MEQLOCN set(s), CREWF and CRMRC fields
          show crew numbers to include assigned and attached personnel. Count only those
          attached personnel available to deploy supporting Unit Type Code (UTC) taskings.
          1.6.8.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) All reported MEPSD and MEORC fields cannot add up
          to more than what is reported in the MEPSA field. All CREWF and CRMRC fields
          reported cannot add up to more than what is reported in the CREWA field.
1.7. SORTS Designed Operational Capability (DOC) Statement (AFF 723) or approved
facsimile). CJCS SORTS policy requires a unit’s Overall C-level to be based on an assessment of
those resources and training required to undertake a unit’s wartime mission(s). The purpose for
a SORTS DOC Statement is to provide units with a single source document of the information
necessary and the location of the references specifying resources to measure and report in
16                                             AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009


SORTS. They also provide a narrative description of the unit’s wartime mission(s). All SORTS
DOC Statements will be completed on a standard or computer generated AFF 723 or an XOOA
approved facsimile.
     1.7.1. There are three types of SORTS DOC Statements. The Primary Mission DOC
     Statement must reflect the unit’s full wartime mission set (all unit wartime missions,
     i.e., in-place, mobility, Air Expeditionary Force (AEF), etc.) and is assigned DOC Number
     (DOCNR) one. Secondary Mission DOC Statements will reflect all resources necessary to
     undertake a major portion of the primary mission and are numbered sequentially using
     DOCNRs 2 through 9. Units with more than eight secondary missions will coordinate with
     HQ USAF SORTS for additional DOCNRs. Secondary DOC Statements are normally
     written for single missions such as mobility. Tertiary Mission DOC Statements will
     reflect all resources necessary to undertake ancillary missions. A Tertiary DOC Statement is
     normally given a DOC number from A-J (K-Z are reserved per HQ USAF SORTS).
     1.7.2. SORTS DOC Statements are not used to establish, organize, design, equip, or task
     units. Need statements, ASs, UMDs, OPLANs, UTCs, AFWUS, etc., serve these functions.
     1.7.3. In coordination with the CRO, FAMs must ensure SORTS DOC Statements are
     written to reflect the wartime capability units are committed to deliver at execution.
     1.7.4. SORTS DOC Statements are approved by the MAJCOM SORTS DOC Statement
     Approval Authority (e.g., ANG SORTS DOC Statements are approved by the ANG
     SORTS office (ANG/ XOOX)). DOC Statements involving multiple MAJCOMs, such
     as gaining unit issues, must be approved by all MAJCOMs involved.
     1.7.5. CROs must provide the following agencies with the SORTS DOC Statement upon
     approval by the CRO.
        1.7.5.1. HQ USAF SORTS.
        1.7.5.2. Interested MAJCOMs.
        1.7.5.3. Initial gaining MAJCOMs.
        1.7.5.4. Parent MAJCOM functional offices.
        1.7.5.5. Parent MAJCOM manpower offices.
        1.7.5.6. Subordinate reporting organizations.
     1.7.6. HQ AFRC and the NGB will provide interested parties a copy of SORTS DOC
     Statement(s) within 45 days of approval.
     1.7.7. Subordinate reporting organizations must make SORTS DOC Statements available
     to measured units, direct support units, and functional offices.
     1.7.8. Recipients at all levels must review new SORTS DOC Statements and forward any
     comments to the FAM.
     1.7.9. SORTS DOC Statements must be reviewed annually by the MAJCOM staff and the
     measured unit commander. Unit commanders must sign the unit DOC Statement upon
     assumption of command or after annual review has been completed. Signature does not
     acknowledge agreement/disagreement. Signature indicates the review has been accomplished
     and the commander and their designated alternates understand the SORTS reporting
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                         17


  requirements in the DOC Statement. Current SORTS DOC Statements must be marked
  with the last review date and maintained for the duration of the initial DOC, i.e., if current
  DOC’s effective date is 1 Jan 2001, and you have a SAV in Mar 2003, records must show
  the initial review and one annual. All unit commander documentation must be shown for the
  life of the DOC. The MAJCOM/ANG/DRU/FOA SORTS office is responsible for the
  tracking and initiation of annual reviews. When an annual review is conducted, notify
  HQ USAF SORTS of the review date via e-mail or the Automatic Digital Network
  (AUTODIN)/Defense Message System (DMS). When altered or outdated the impacted
  SORTS DOC Statement must be replaced or rescinded, as applicable. The applicable
  MAJCOM/ANG/DRU/FOA SORTS office will ensure that HQ USAF SORTS receives the
  current SORTS DOC Statement via electronic mail media; (e-mail or AUTODIN/DMS) or
  an automated DOC Statement system.
     1.7.9.1. Unexpected changes to unit DOC Statements must be accomplished within
     60 days of changes in unit data, i.e., Unit & Mission Identification, Measured
     Resource areas (personnel, equipment, training), or any item that would affect unit
     reporting requirements. Expected changes must be accomplished 30 days prior to the
     change.
     1.7.9.2. DOC Statement pen and ink changes will only be completed for administrative
     purposes. Administrative changes include DOC effective date, spelling or grammatical
     errors, etc. All pen and ink changes will be originated by the OPR for the
     DOC Statement and submitted to all agencies that originally coordinated on the
     DOC undergoing the change. Any change to DOC content, such as Unit data,
     UTC identification, unit reporting instructions, or other material that effects the actual
     reporting of information requires a new/revised DOC Statement submitted through
     normal coordination channels.
     1.7.9.3. For coordination timelines and detailed instructions on preparing DOC
     Statements, see Attachment 2.
  1.7.10. (Added-AFSOC) Forward all comments concerning a new AFSOC Designed
  Operational Capability (DOC) Statement to the Functional Area Managers (FAM) through
  HQ AFSOC/A3OR.
  1.7.11. (Added-AFSOC) HQ AFSOC/A3OR is the command’s DOC Statement manager.
  AFSOC FAMs writing a new DOC Statement, conducting an annual review or rewriting an
  existing DOC Statement will initiate the process with HQ AFSOC/A3OR. Once the DOC
  Statement is ready, HQ AFSOC/A3OR will begin the coordination process. If during the
  coordination any necessary changes are identified, the FAM is responsible for making the
  corrections. Once corrections are made, the coordination process will continue through HQ
  AFSOC/A3OR. The original, signed copy of all DOC Statements will be maintained by HQ
  AFSOC/A3OR. HQ AFSOC/A3OR is responsible for distributing new, reviewed or
  rewritten DOC Statements external to HQ AFSOC.
  1.7.12. (Added-AFSOC) Upon receipt of a new DOC Statement, units have 30 days to
  review and begin reporting accordingly.
18                                            AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009


     1.7.13. (Added-AFSOC) FAMs will be notified by HQ AFSOC/A3OR, a minimum of
     60 days prior, to complete the DOC Statement annual review. DOC Statements being
     rewritten or updated are not exempt from the annual review requirement.
     HQ AFSOC/A3OR will notify the applicable Subordinate Reporting Organization
     (SRO)/Command Representative (COMREP) when the annual review is completed. The
     SRO/COMREP is responsible for ensuring the applicable unit receives the notification the
     annual MAJCOM review has been accomplished.
        1.7.13.1. (Added-AFSOC) The annual review must be completed by the anniversary of
        the DOC Statement’s effective date. Annual reviews are expected to be a rigorous
        review and validation of the DOC Statement.
            1.7.13.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) During the annual review, FAMs will coordinate with
            HQ AFSOC/A1MP, HQ AFSOC/A1RR, HQ AFSOC/A4RX and 623 AOC/SPDD to
            verify the DOC Statement(s) accurately reflect wartime mission requirements and
            perform a complete reconciliation of DOC Statement(s) to the Force Flow,
            Manpower Force Element Listing (MFEL), War Mobilization Planning (WMP), Unit
            Type Code (UTC), Unit Manning Document (UMD) and any other applicable
            planning documents. All mismatches with war planning documents will be identified
            and corrected. All changes will be documented in the FAM continuity files and all
            source documents maintained until resolution.
            1.7.13.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) 623 AOC/SPDD will assist FAMs in validating
            response time(s), sortie rates, UTCs and operations plan (OPLAN) taskings.
            1.7.13.1.3. (Added-AFSOC) HQ AFSOC/A4RX provides FAMs guidance on all
            logistical issues. During the UTC validation process, HQ AFSOC/A4R in concert
            with HQ AFSOC/A1RR and 623 AOC/SPDD ensures overall accountability within
            the Unit Type Code Availability (UTCA) and coordinates appropriate Operational
            Plan’s DW - coded UTC apportionment. HQ AFSOC/A4RX is the responsible agent
            for Logistical Detail (LOGDET) management to include development, maintenance
            and accuracy as required to ensure the actual content of the LOGDETs are in
            compliance with AF Directives to include all current Weapon/Non-weapon System
            Allowance Standards.
            1.7.13.1.4. (Added-AFSOC) HQ AFSOC/A1RR will assist FAMs in validating the
            UTCs against authorized unit manpower as defined in AFI 38-205, Manpower and
            Quality Readiness and Contingency Management.
1.8. Single and Multiple SORTS DOC Statement (AFF 723 or approved
facsimile). N or m ally, a unit has a single SORTS DOC Statement, called the Primary Mission
DOC, which reflects all the unit assigned/tasked wartime mission(s), including the most
stringent contingency mission. The Primary DOC Statement Overall C-level for a unit is the
primary readiness indicator available to the Joint/Air Staffs and component commanders, and is
based on the capability of a unit to accomplish it’s full wartime mission set(s). DOC Statements
will not be written to only reflect an AEF steady state commitment; such commitments may be
added in the Remarks section at MAJCOM option. See Attachment 2 for details.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                         19


   1.8.1. If a unit’s total wartime mission is composed of significantly different component
   missions (mobility, generation, nuclear, conventional, etc.), the parent MAJCOM may elect
   to produce multiple SORTS DOC Statements for that unit. Multiple SORTS DOC Statements
   will be organized as follows:
       1.8.1.1. The primary mission SORTS DOC Statement will be assigned DOCNR 1
       and will encompass all the missions assigned to a unit. There will be only one primary
       mission SORTS DOC Statement.
       1.8.1.2. Any major portion of a unit’s total wartime mission requiring assessment
       separate and apart from the primary mission SORTS DOC Statement is referenced in
       a secondary mission SORTS DOC Statement. Examples include conventional
       munitions delivery, Operations Plan 8044 Revision 03, nuclear munitions delivery,
       mobility, in-place generation, etc.
       1.8.1.3. Ancillary portions of a unit’s total wartime mission that require assessment
       separate and apart from the Primary or Secondary SORTS DOC Statement are referenced
       in a Tertiary Mission SORTS DOC Statement. Examples would be individual UTCs,
       force protection, operational risk management, etc.
       1.8.1.4. Primary DOC Statements will only address a single set of resources listed on
       a unit’s DOC and are limited to only resources authorized to that unit or Direct
       Support Unit (DSU). A unit’s Primary DOC Statement (for SORTS C-level
       assessment purposes) must not reference resources already measured under another
       unit’s DOC Statement. Two units cannot measure the same resources, however, a unit’s
       Secondary or Tertiary DOC Statement(s) may reference the same Primary
       DOC resources for a secondary mission assessment. This does not constitute double
       counting of resources as this procedure is intended to provide a separate assessment of
       single missions or capabilities.
   1.8.2. Overall C-level data for the Secondary or Tertiary SORTS DOC Statement is
   reported in the Subordinate Overall (SUBOVRAL) set.
1.9. Measuring Unit Resources using DOC Response Time. Air Force units must be ready
for deployment and/or employment within a specified time, referred to as the unit’s DOC
response time. Measurement of unit resources is based on the measured resource areas expected
to be mission ready by the DOC response time and the expected Overall C-level at the DOC
response time.
   1.9.1. Response Time. Resource status is a calculated forecast of a mission or alert response
   time of up to 72 hours (CJCSM 3150.02). Units with multiple missions and/or response times
   also apply these rules. Multiple response times should be applied accordingly to resources
   required by each response time. SORTS Primary DOC Statements list the shortest of
   multiple response times that all unit resources are expected to be ready or recalled.
20                                              AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009


     1.9.2. Using Response Time. Air Force units project C-level status within their response
     time. When projecting resource status, units will count all resources (as available, that are
     expected to be ready by the response time). Consider the following factors, as a minimum,
     when projecting unit resource status:
        1.9.2.1. The unit’s actual deployment posture.
        1.9.2.2. The unit can conduct emergency recall of personnel, curtail scheduled
        maintenance/routine training unrelated to deployed posture, and increase work shift
        length.
        1.9.2.3. The delivery schedules for ordering items from outside agencies will not
        change from current projections.
        1.9.2.4. Allocate resources to units under a parent organization based on the
        subordinate unit’s place in the deployment sequence.
1.10. Category-Levels (C-levels) and Associated Remarks. C-levels reflect the degree to
which unit resources meet prescribed levels of personnel, equipment, and training.
     1.10.1. C-1. The unit possesses the required resources and is trained to undertake the
     full wartime mission(s) for which it is organized or designed. The resource and training
     area status will neither limit flexibility and methods for mission accomplishment nor
     increase vulnerability of unit personnel and equipment. The unit does not require any
     compensation for any deficiencies.
     1.10.2. C-2. The unit possesses the required resources and is trained to undertake most of the
     wartime mission(s) for which it is organized or designed. The resource and training area
     status may cause isolated decreases in flexibility in methods for mission accomplishment,
     but will not increase the unit's vulnerability under most envisioned operational scenarios.
     The unit would require little, if any, compensation for deficiencies.
     1.10.3. C-3. The unit possesses the required resources and is trained to undertake many, but
     not all, portions of the wartime mission(s) for which it is organized or designed. The
     resource and training area status will result in significant decrease in flexibility for
     mission accomplishment and will increase vulnerability of the unit under many, but not
     all, envisioned operational scenarios. The unit would require significant compensation for
     deficiencies.
     1.10.4. C-4. The unit requires additional resources or training to undertake its wartime
     mission(s), but it may be directed to undertake portions of its wartime mission(s) with
     resources O/H.
     1.10.5. C-5. The unit is undergoing a Service-directed resource action and is not prepared,
     at this time, to undertake the mission set for which it is organized or designed. Within the
     CBDRT report, units will use C-5 to indicate when they have no NBC defense equipment
     or training requirements, See Attachment 4.
     1.10.6. C-6. The unit is not required to measure assets in a specified area. C-6 (not a rating)
     may not be used as an Overall C-level.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                              21


  1.10.7. Overall C-level. Only the commander, or officially designated representative, of the
  measured unit is authorized to assign an Overall C-level. Commanders may not modify
  calculated resource area category levels, but are expected to use judgment in the commander’s
  assessment and to raise or lower the overall category level when appropriate. Higher echelons
  of command may add remarks to a unit’s SORTS report to further explain a situation or
  deficiency but may not change subordinate unit C-levels.
  1.10.8. Assigning the Overall C-level. Based on unit readiness, unit commanders assign the
  Overall C-level each time it is reported. Normally, the lowest level of the four measured
  resource areas is reported as the Overall C-level provided it is a realistic indication of the
  unit’s readiness (based on the C-level definitions). As a reminder, the measured area data
  cannot be arbitrarily changed from calculated values (must be reported per the specified
  formulas and tables). If the lowest measured area level is not a realistic indication of the unit’s
  Overall C-level, commanders can assess the Overall C-level to a level that better indicates
  unit readiness. Commanders are expected to use their judgment during assessments and
  may raise or lower the overall C-level. At a minimum, commanders should consider the
  following factors when determining the overall unit C-level: inspection results, assistance
  team results, program readiness reviews, and the number of critical personnel in support
  of Small Scale Contingencies (SSC) deployments. Units attaining an Operational
  Readiness Inspection (ORI) or Nuclear Surety Inspection (NSI) Marginal or Unsatisfactory
  inspection result will consider lowering the Overall C-level and providing remarks outlining
  deficiencies and resource improvement timetables. The remarks should reflect training
  requirements and/or resource actions necessary to satisfactorily accomplish the inspection
  and anticipated completion dates. The commander will provide rationale for any
  assessment in a remark using the Overall Reason Organization not C-1 (REASN) label.
  The following factors should also be considered:
     1.10.8.1. Personnel subjective factors:
         1.10.8.1.1. Availability of personnel who do not have the required Air Force
         specialty code (AFSC) or skill level but are able to accomplish mission tasks.
         1.10.8.1.2. Unusually high/low formal education level, morale, or unit cohesion.
         1.10.8.1.3. Personnel turnover rates that impact mission accomplishment.
         1.10.8.1.4. Availability of contractors to provide services in support of generation
         mission.
     1.10.8.2. Equipment and Supplies O/H subjective factors:
         1.10.8.2.1. Item shortages having a larger effect than indicated by equipment fill rate.
         1.10.8.2.2. Availability of older items able to substitute functionally and
         inter-operate with required items.
         1.10.8.2.3. Status of plans to move resources from temporary peacetime locations, to
         wartime locations.
         1.10.8.2.4. Differences between standard fill rates and various assessment tools.
         1.10.8.2.5. Individual protective equipment items availability (e.g., mobility bags).
22                                               AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009


            1.10.8.2.6. The availability of special equipment that may be used to increase the
            chance for success under adverse conditions or add flexibility to mission
            accomplishment.
        1.10.8.3. Equipment Condition subjective factors:
            1.10.8.3.1. Demonstrated maintenance        surge   capabilities   during   exercises,
            inspections, or operations.
            1.10.8.3.2. Depot programmed and unscheduled maintenance status probability.
            1.10.8.3.3. Status of modification programs and their impact on daily operations.
            1.10.8.3.4. Mission Ready rates.
        1.10.8.4. Training subjective factors:
            1.10.8.4.1. Availability of qualified training personnel (rated and non-rated), of
            equipment and/or facilities, and of areas, ranges, and flying hours.
            1.10.8.4.2. Major training event time lapses or a high turnover of key personnel.
            1.10.8.4.3. Completion of any specialized training that increases the chances for
            mission accomplishment.
        1.10.8.5. Other subjective factors:
            1.10.8.5.1. The unit’s ability to operate in a nuclear, biological, and chemical
            environment, see CBDRT.
            1.10.8.5.2. Another unit’s C-level when also required for a specific mission.
            1.10.8.5.3. Host or tenant mission requirements.
            1.10.8.5.4. Ability of contractors to provide contingency or wartime services.
            1.10.8.5.5. Ability of unit assigned foreign nationals to perform assigned wartime
            tasks during contingencies or wartime.
     1.10.9. Assigning C-5 as the Overall C-level. A parent MAJCOM may authorize use of C-5
     for units undergoing a service-directed resource action and which are not prepared to
     undertake the mission set for which they are organized or designed. C-5 cannot be reported
     in any measured resource area and C-5 status will not exceed one year for Active Duty or
     three years for Guard/Reserve units from the designated start date of the conversion or
     transition. C-5 is only used when authorized by the parent MAJCOM and one of the
     following conditions exists:
        1.10.9.1. Unit Transition. Unit transitions include modernization/conversion of major
        equipment (F-4s to F-16s), modernization/upgrade of software in major equipment
        (extensive equipment testing/personnel user training), a change in a unit’s mission
        (which can be accomplished without changing the major equipment involved), and/or a
        change in a unit’s home station location (higher headquarters approval may be required).
        When a unit is undergoing a transition and the first measured area C-level falls to C-4,
        C-5 may be authorized. Report C-5 as the Overall C-level and report the current
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                             23


      measured area C-levels until the old DOC is rescinded and the new DOC is effective.
      Units will continue to report their Overall C-level as C-5 until all measured areas
      (except areas authorized to report C-6) have improved to C-3. SORTS reports and
      DOC Statements are based on the wartime mission(s) for which the unit is organized or
      designed. Unit transitions are not wartime missions. Therefore, separate DOC
      Statements will not be written for transitions.
      1.10.9.2. Unit Activation or Re-activation. Activating units may be authorized to
      report C-5 as their Overall C-level until all measured areas have reached a maintainable
      C-3 (except measured areas authorized to be reported as Code 6) or the end of the
      designated activation period, whichever occurs first.
      1.10.9.3. Unit Deactivation. Deactivating units will continue to report SORTS
      measured areas based on their current DOC Statement. Units may be authorized to
      report C-5 after the first measured area reaches C-4. Units must continue to report
      SORTS until unit deactivation is authorized by the publication of a command order
      (G-Series) at which time the SORTS DOC Statement(s) is/ are rescinded. Once a unit
      has deactivated, MAJCOMs will ensure all pertinent unit data is removed from the
      database. Necessary actions must also be undertaken to remove the unit from tasking
      documents (OPLANs, CONPLANS, service war planning documents such as the
      AFWUS, etc.).
      1.10.9.4. Units not manned or equipped but required in wartime force structure.
      HQ USAF SORTS will determine what data will be reported for any units of this type.
      1.10.9.5. Units authorized to report C-5 will continue to compute and report measured
      area C-levels at least monthly unless directed to do so more frequently by the parent
      MAJCOM.
   1.10.10. Explaining the Overall C-level. Remarks will be used to explain and amplify data
   contained in a SORTS report. All remarks must be written in plain English and clearly
   explain why the unit is less than C-1, what actions are being taken to resolve the problem,
   what resources are needed, and when the C-level will change. Acronyms may only be
   used if previously defined in the remark in which that acronym is being used.
   See Chapter 2 for further direction.

     ensure applicable AFWUS UTC records are listed in section IIC.
  1.11.9. Intermediate Headquarters Numbered Air Forces (NAF): Normally, organizations
  between MAJCOM and wing/base don’t have a direct SORTS role unless acting as the
  AF component to a unified command. However, MAJCOMs may assign SORTS
  responsibilities to NAFs. As a component headquarters during contingencies NAFs will:
     1.11.9.1. Ensure assigned units (those with OPCON) submit timely and accurate reports.
     1.11.9.2. When gaining deploying units, assist the CRO with identifying SRO for the
     deployed units.
  1.11.10. Wings/Bases (normally the SRO level): MAJCOMs may assign responsibilities
  for geographically separated units to a wing/base or to the measured unit itself.
     1.11.10.1. Wing/Base Commander:
        1.11.10.1.1. Wing leadership is expected to review SORTS reports to ensure they
        are accurate, timely, valid, and complete. This includes ensuring that remarks explain

               1.11.10.2.1.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) The 1 SOW Command Post is the
               designated Subordinate Reporting Organization (SRO) for all active duty
               AFSOC units assigned to Hurlburt Field, Eglin AFB and Duke Field and will
               ensure these units submit timely SORTS reports. The 27 SOW Command
               Post is the designated SRO for all active duty units assigned to Cannon AFB
               and will ensure these units submit timely SORTS reports. For AFSOC
               overseas units, the COMREP has SRO responsibilities and will ensure
               submittal of SORTS for AFSOC units in accordance with the host-tenant
               support agreement. The 720 STG will oversee submission of all assigned
               units. Note: Because COMREP positions are one-man deep positions, a
               written notification must be sent to HQ AFSOC/A3OR regarding any time
               away from duty (i.e. leave, TDY, etc.). A SORTS point of contact must be
               included in the notification to include duty phone number, unclassified and
               classified email address.
                 1.11.10.2.1.1.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) The SRO/COMREP is responsible for
                 crosschecking inputs and remarks to ensure completeness and that all
                 remarks are self-explanatory.
           1.11.10.2.1.2. To handle SORTS problems at the lowest possible level and
           prevent circumvention of command authority levels, Wing/Base SORTS Offices
           will solicit all contact with HQ USAF SORTS through their parent MAJCOM
           SORTS Office.
        1.11.10.2.2. Enter into SORTS only that C-level data approved by the commander of
        the measured unit. This includes the RICDA date, which cannot be updated without a
        report from the measured unit commander. The RICDA date is the "as of" currency
        date for the entire measured unit's database.
        1.11.10.2.3. Maintain a current record of each subordinate unit’s GSORTS data.
        1.11.10.2.4. Notify units and staff agencies of reporting requirements using approved
        SORTS DOC Statement(s).

        1.11.10.2.6. As a minimum, conduct and document initial and quarterly recurring
        SORTS training for subordinate unit SORTS monitors. Documented training
        records must be maintained at the Wing/Base level.
           1.11.10.2.6.1. (Added-AFSOC) The SRO/COMREP is responsible for
           initial/quarterly training of SORTS monitors and personnel providing data to unit
           SORTS monitors; provide documentation of training. If SORTS monitors have
           already received SORTS training from a previous assignment (within the past
           year), refresher training of local SORTS procedures fulfills the initial training
           requirement.
        1.11.10.2.7. Conduct and document initial and recurring commander SORTS
        training.
           1.11.10.2.7.1. (Added-AFSOC) The SRO/COMREP will ensure measured unit
           commanders, their designated alternates, direct supporting unit (DSU)
           commanders and designated alternates receive initial SORTS training. Annually
           provide and document refresher training of commanders and their designated
           alternates.
        1.11.10.2.8. Provide unit SORTS monitors with a copy of that unit’s current SORTS
        database anytime an updated report is submitted. Only products that reflect the
        current GSORTS database will be used. AFSORTSDET Easy Reads do not reflect
        current GSORTS database information and will not be used as the unit’s current
        database copy.
           1.11.10.2.8.1. (Added-AFSOC) AFSOC units will maintain the current
           UIC DUMP message generated by the GSORTS database.
        1.11.10.2.9. Remind unit SORTS monitors to validate unit data and notify the SRO
        immediately if discrepancies are found. Ensure monitors know that correction reports
        must be submitted and processed within 24 hours.
           1.11.10.2.9.1. (Added-AFSOC) AFSOC units will use the UIC DUMP message
           generated by GSORTS to validate the accuracy and currency of information in
           the GSORTS database.
        1.11.10.2.10. Notify, in writing, all designated DSU commanders of their
        appointment and responsibilities as a SORTS DSU unit.
        1.11.10.2.11. (Added-AFSOC) The SRO/COMREP will accomplish an annual
        Staff Assistance Visit (SAV) for all measured units. Units will provide an update to
        the SRO/COMREP 30 days after the SAV detailing the status of all discrepancies
        found. Follow up reports will be every 45 days thereafter until the discrepancies no
        longer exists.
        1.11.10.2.12. (Added-AFSOC) The SRO/COMREP will provide a schedule to the
        SORTS monitors of when SORTS reports are due for input. Ensure turn-in dates do
        not allow reports to go over 30 days due to weekends, holidays or long months.
34                                    AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009


     1.11.10.2.13. (Added-AFSOC) After a CRO conducted SAV, the SRO/COMREP
     will provide an update to the CRO 30 days later detailing the status of all
     discrepancies found. Follow up reports will be provided every 45 days thereafter
     until the discrepancies no longer exists.
     1.11.10.2.14. (Added-AFSOC) The SRO/COMREP will maintain a SORTS
     continuity binder in the following order:
        1.11.10.2.14.1. (Added-AFSOC) Air Force Instructions (AFIs) utilized to
        complete SORTS reporting. The AFIs may be kept electronically.
        1.11.10.2.14.2. (Added-AFSOC) Letter of SRO appointment. Note: General
        Schedule (GS) employees and COMREPs do not need a letter of appointment.

     1.11.11. Measured Unit (those named on SORTS DOC Statements):
        1.11.11.1. Measured Unit Commander:
           1.11.11.1.1. Designate, in writing, alternates who are capable of completing all
           SORTS reporting actions in absence of the commander.
              1.11.11.1.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) The unit commander or a designated alternate
              must sign the first worksheet and initial each sequential worksheet prior to
              transmitting the report. If any category or significant remark changes are made
              prior to submission, the commander must sign the worksheet. Minor pen and ink
              changes may be initialed by the SORTS monitor. Note: A designated alternate
              must be able to act on the CC’s behalf in his or her absence. The commander’s
              alternate(s) will have the same SORTS training as the commander. The unit
              SORTS monitor will not be the designated alternate.
           1.11.11.1.2. Appoint and ensure that two or more SORTS monitors are adequately
           trained to perform SORTS duties emphasizing the need for accuracy and
           attention-to-detail. Units must maintain the ability to deploy one SORTS trained
           monitor, and allow for peacetime leave and TDYs without disrupting normal
           reporting requirements. Reports will not be delayed due to unavailability of SORTS
           monitors.
           1.11.11.1.3. Ensure    report    submissions    meet     established    time    lines
           (see paragraph 2.4).
           1.11.11.1.4. Ensure data reflected in the SORTS report adequately reflects the unit’s
           ability to undertake the missions for which the unit was organized or designed.
           1.11.11.1.5. Review remarks monthly for additions, changes, or deletions. Ensure
           remarks are updated each time a full report or a partial report containing remarks is
           submitted. Remark dates will not exceed 31 days since their last update. Review data
           and remarks for quality and assign an Overall C-level based on assessment of
           measured data and SORTS DOC Statement mission(s).
              1.11.11.1.5.1. When reporting less than C-1, whether commander assessed
              or not, describe in a REASN remark what mission(s) or portions of the
              mission(s) the unit is not performing, capable of performing, or the reason for an
              assessment.
              1.11.11.1.5.2. Explain deficiencies in layman’s terms, addressing planned
              corrective actions and a realistic resolution date.
           1.11.11.1.6. Each time a new report is processed, commanders will signify their
           review of their current database by signing an SRO provided SORTS product that
           reflects the current data in the GSORTS database.
           1.11.11.1.7. Recommend changes to unit SORTS DOC Statement to the
           MAJCOM FAM and provide an information copy to the CRO.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                        37


        1.11.11.1.8. Must review, sign, and date SORTS DOC Statement(s) as soon as
        possible after assuming command, receiving a new statement, upon a change to an
        existing statement, and annually thereafter.
        1.11.11.1.8. (AFSOC) Unit commanders will review, sign and date newly received
        DOC Statements within 30 days of receipt. Annual reviews will be accomplished by
        the anniversary date of the DOC Statement and documented on the last page of the
        AF Form 723.
           1.11.11.1.8.1. Signing and dating a DOC Statement signifies that the
           commander has reviewed and understands implications for SORTS reporting
           required by their DOC. It is not coordination for, nor does it signify agreement
           with, the DOC Statement.
           1.11.11.1.8.2. SORTS DOC Statements are directive in nature and SORTS
           reporting, per a SORTS DOC Statement, must continue even when resolving
           DOC issues.
        1.11.11.1.9. Ensure personnel duty status (medical, leave, TDY, administrative
        action, etc.) is monitored daily by the Commander’s Support Staff (CSS). As duty
        status changes occur, the CSS must immediately update effected Personnel Data
        Systems. Refer to AFI 36-2134, Air Force Duty Status Program, for duty status
        reporting and program management guidance.

        1.11.11.2.1. Unit SORTS Monitors will be responsive to the direction of their
        Wing, MAJCOM SORTS Offices, and HQ USAF SORTS. To handle SORTS
        problems at the lowest possible level and prevent circumvention of command
        authority levels, Unit SORTS Offices will initiate all contact with HQ USAF
        SORTS through their parent Wing, MAJCOM FAM and MAJCOM SORTS Offices.
        1.11.11.2.2. Prepare unit SORTS report after collecting information, extracting
        data from existing records, calculating percentages and measured area levels,
        assigning reason codes, and preparing remarks.
        1.11.11.2.3. Advise the commander regarding SORTS DOC Statement discrepancies.
        1.11.11.2.4. Unit SORTS Monitors will ensure that:
           1.11.11.2.4.1. Reports are prepared at least every 30 days or sooner in order to
           meet the NLT 31-day mandate.
               1.11.11.2.4.1.1. Validate unit data each time data is processed into the
               SORTS database. Use a SORTS product, provided by the SRO or downloaded
               from the HQ USAF SORTS Classified Web Page, that reflects the current
               GSORTS database status. Notify the SRO immediately if discrepancies are
               found.

        1.11.12.1.6. Ensures that a process is established for the availability tracking of DoD
        civilians reported in the unit's SORTS reports.
        1.11.12.1.7. (Added-AFSOC) At the discretion of the SRO/COMREP, primary
        SORTS monitors may provide quarterly SORTS training for their unit’s DSU SORTS
        monitors. This training will include the unit’s requirements from the DSU. The
        SRO/COMREP maintains responsibility for the DSU SORTS monitor training.
        Attending the 334 TRS MTT SORTS Data Handler’s Course is optional and may be
        used in place of initial training provided by the SRO.
        1.11.12.1.8. (Added-AFSOC) Annually review all DOC Statements the unit
        supports. Document and maintain reviews.
     1.11.12.2. DSU SORTS Monitor:
        1.11.12.2.1. Assists the measured unit SORTS monitors in preparing SORTS data.
        1.11.12.2.2. Provides the measured unit with status of allocated resources and
        ensures those resources are counted in only one unit’s SORTS reports.
        1.11.12.2.3. Validates unit data on a monthly basis using monthly SRO-provided
        SORTS products that reflect the current data in the GSORTS database. Notify the
        SRO immediately if any discrepancies are found. Track discrepancies in subsequent
        reports to ensure they have been corrected.
        1.11.12.2.4. Verifies personnel duty status is accurate with the CSS. Refer to
        AFI 36-2134, Air Force Duty Status Program, for duty status reporting and program
        management guidance.
        1.11.12.2.5. Thoroughly briefs the unit commander prior to obtaining his/her
        signature on the unit SORTS input to the measured unit for release authority,
        advising of any discrepancies noted in previous inputs and actions being taken to
        correct them.

            1.11.12.2.6. (Added-AFSOC) It is very important that DSU SORTS monitors
            supporting more than one unit ensure that the combination of data provided does not
            exceed available resources.
            1.11.12.2.7. (Added-AFSOC) DSU SORTS monitors will maintain a continuity
            folder/binder with information in the following order:
                1.11.12.2.7.1. (Added-AFSOC) Appointment letter signed by the squadron
                commander. This letter will be provided to each measured unit SORTS monitor
                supported by the DSU.
                1.11.12.2.7.2. (Added-AFSOC) Documentation of 334 TRS MTT SORTS Data
                Handler’s Course training received if applicable.
                1.11.12.2.7.3. (Added-AFSOC) Documentation            of   training   provided    by
                SRO/COMREP.
                1.11.12.2.7.4. (Added-AFSOC) Maintain     all  UTCs      supported   with
                corresponding DOC Statement(s). If supporting more than one unit, maintain
                each unit’s data separately.
     1.11.13. 334 TRS (SORTS) Mobile Training Team (MTT):
        1.11.13.1. Provide SORTS Data Handlers Course to any base, as requested by MAJCOM
        on a fiscal year basis (ten student minimum). Upon request of the unit hosting the Data
        Handlers Course the MTT can provide a Commanders Briefing (one hour) ―SORTS from
        a Commanders Perspective‖. The commander’s course will only be conducted at unit
        request and will be accomplished on the last day of the Data Handlers Course.
            1.11.13.1.1. Units desiring the MTT to teach at their base should coordinate their
            requests through their CRO.
            1.11.13.1.2. Data Handlers Course is mandatory for all new SORTS monitors at the
            earliest opportunity and should be attended by all SORTS monitors anytime that
            AFI 10-201 has been completely revised.
        1.11.13.2. When requested by the CRO, the MTT will provide a one-day course at the
        MAJCOM location for FAMs.
1.12. SORTS Report Error Messages and Troubleshooting Actions. Errors detected in a
unit’s SORTS report or the headquarters database must be corrected and resubmitted within 24
hours of receipt of a RAMP reporting errors or upon discovery that an error exists in the
database.
     1.12.1. If a reporting unit fails to receive a RAMP message within 72 hours of report, notify
     the parent MAJCOM as soon as possible seeking resolution. HQ USAF will assist in
     difficult or confusing cases.
     1.12.2. Reference Table 1.2, ―SORTS Joint Report AF (SORTSREPAF) Trouble-shooting,‖
     for possible corrective actions to format and logical edit errors. Table contains information on
     common errors but is not all-inclusive.
     1.12.3. (Added-AFSOC) Difficulties in correcting or resubmitting corrected messages
     within the required time must be reported to HQ AFSOC/A3OR through the SRO/COMREP.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                       43


1.13. SORTS Message Sequence Counter Number.
   1.13.1. Unit SORTS and/or CBDRT reports will be sequentially numbered 001-999.
   Although transcribed in AFSORTSDET as a seemingly singular report, SORTS and
   CBDRT reports are counted separately. Counters will not be restarted for fiscal or calendar
   years.
      1.13.1.1. When SROs are transmitting single, multiple-part, SORTS messages, the
      counter should be bumped forward to allow the next report in the series to process to
      avoid unnecessary delays.
      1.13.1.2. Only Air Staff or MAJCOM SORTS agencies may request Defense
      Information Systems Agency (DISA) bump the GSORTS message processor counter.
      DISA will coordinate with appropriate headquarters prior to making the change. Any
      additional notifications will be made, as required.
   1.13.2. When units are experiencing difficulties with their message sequence numbers,
   CROs, may use the GSORTS OVERRIDE feature to override the normal sequencing of
   message traffic. Users are responsible for the consequences of overriding.
      1.13.2.1. OVERRIDE message numbering will be sequential (e.g., 001Y, 002Y,
      003Y). Non-sequential OVERRIDE reporting is not authorized under any circumstance.
      1.13.2.2. Units choosing to use OVERRIDE message sequencing will take immediate
      corrective action on any errors that occur as a result of out of sequence message
      processing.
1.14. (Added-AFSOC) Transmitting SORTS reports. Submit all SORTS reports via
Readiness Assessment System-Input Tool (RAS-IT). Notify HQ AFSOC/A3OR via unclassified
e-mail, message or telephone when out of cycle reports are transmitted. Include the Unit
Identification Code (UIC) of the unit reported, report number and the date, time of the
transmission and reason for transmission (e.g. updating MEQLOCN).
   1.14.1. (Added-AFSOC) The unit commander or a designated alternate must sign the first
   worksheet and initial each sequential worksheet prior to transmitting the report.

                                             Chapter 2

            REPORTING CATEGORY LEVEL (C-LEVEL) DATA ELEMENTS

Section 2A—Measured Categories and General Rules

2.1. General Resource Relationship to Unit Combat Preparedness. C-levels are developed
by the JS and derived through quantitative criteria to define in qualitative terms, the degree to
which a measured unit is capable of performing the wartime mission(s) for which it was
organized and designed. C-levels provide clarity of resource status to advise the Secretary of
Defense, unified commands, and the Services on current force readiness.
     2.1.1. C-levels collectively represent, via a five point scale, the degree to which a unit meets
     standards established within four measured resource areas: 1) personnel, 2) training,
     3) equipment and supplies O/H, and 4) equipment condition, plus an Overall C-level assigned
     by the measured unit commander.
     2.1.2. While the JCS require only the Overall and measured area C-levels, the AF requires
     units to report actual raw data percentages in each measured area. This gives a crisis
     decision-maker and resource or training manager more detailed status than the C-levels
     alone indicate.
2.2. When To Use This Chapter. Command echelons, above measured units, use this chapter
to ensure C-level data is relayed without change or delay and to comment on its content when
appropriate. Measured units and below will use chapter sections as follows:
     2.2.1. Section 2A. Used to calculate values for C-level data elements and gather data for the
     preparation/transmission of properly formatted SORTS reports.
     2.2.2. Section 2B. Used to gather source document data (see paragraph 2.9 and Table 2.2),
     identify Limiting Factor(s) (LIMFAC), formulate detailed narratives and forecast changes in
     Overall C-levels, and verify correct reporting of narrative remarks.
     2.2.3. Section 2C. Used to report AF SPECAP data.
2.3. General Policy for C-level Calculations.
     2.3.1. CJCS policy requires all Active, ANG, and AF Reserve operating force and
     provisional combat, combat support, and combat service support units apportioned to or
     deployed in support of an OPLAN, CONPLAN, OPERATIONS PLAN 8044 REVISION
     03, or service war planning documents, e.g. WMP and AFWUS, be designated as SORTS
     reporting measured units. Unit types listed in Attachment 2, Table A2.1 through A2.4, are
     required to report SORTS. Additional unit types identified are necessary for crisis planning
     whether or not those units are currently tasked in plans. The following policy guidelines
     apply to all reporting units:
        2.3.1.1. Two units will not count the same resource as available.
        2.3.1.2. A unit’s Overall C-level will be based only on the resources and training
        organic (assigned, allocated, or direct support) to it or its parent unit. Mobile or
        transportable communications units may include those resources on loan that can be
        re-deployed within the reported unit’s SORTS DOC Statement response time.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                             49


       2.3.1.3. Units calculate and report area levels (P, S, R, and T) for all four measured
       resource areas unless exempted by Table 2.1. Use only published objective criteria for
       measurement. Do not subjectively raise or lower measured resource area levels.
       2.3.1.4. Only measured unit commanders, or their designated alternates, can assign
       the unit’s Overall C-level. Unless factors like those listed in Chapter 4,
       paragraph 1.10.8, warrant a level change, report the lowest of the four measured levels
       as the Overall C-level.
       2.3.1.5. Command echelons, above the measured unit, will not change any reported
       levels or delay the submission of a report. The command echelon may submit additional
       remarks to comment on reported levels or describe assistance actions.
       2.3.1.6. Units not reporting a C-1 in all areas must clearly indicate the reason(s). Refer to
       Section 2B, paragraph 2.11, for specific remark content requirements.
2.4. Frequency of Reporting C-level Data Elements. CJCS policy requires unit C-level
changes to reach the National Military Command Center (NMCC) within 24 hours after a
reportable event or upon direction of the CJCS, the Services, or CRO. GSORTS is the readiness
reporting system for the NMCC. AF units will report C-level changes within 24 hours of the
change for each SORTS DOC Statement. Report when there are changes in the Overall
C-level, Overall Reason Code, measured area levels, measured area reason codes, PCTEF, D, E,
F, and G reason codes (DEFG), GWD updates, forecast dates, or when directed by the measured
unit commander. If a unit is committed to combat operations (i.e., located in a combat zone),
report C-level data as described above or at the frequency and level of detail as directed by the
CJCS.
   2.4.1. SORTS measured units will verify and update data elements listed in this chapter
   every 28-30 days or more frequently if specifically directed. Unless otherwise authorized by
   HQ USAF SORTS, databases will never be older than 31 days from the last report based on
   the RICDA date. Units and/ or their designated SROs must ensure that submitted reports
   process. Units will verify GSORTS database accuracy via receiving error-free RAMP and
   subsequent SORTS Database Review messages. Units will compare reports submitted
   against their database reviews (or equivalent products), and ensure that non-receipt of a
   RAMP or review within 72 hours (since time of report transmittal) is reported to the
   CRO for assistance. Units and/or SROs failing to meet listed timing criteria are in direct
   violation of AFI 10-201 and CJCSM 3150.02.
       2.4.1.1. Units will continue to report SORTS when TDY for training, when deployed
       (e.g., Red Flag, natural disaster, crisis, OPORD, Deployment Order (DEPORD),
       Expeditionary Aerospace Force/Air Expeditionary Force (EAF/AEF), etc.), or when
       involved in local training (base phase exercises, inspections, etc.).
       2.4.1.2. Secondary and Tertiary Mission data will be reported using the same timelines as
       Primary Mission data.
   2.4.2. Submit data to the appropriate labels in AFSORTSDET and a new report date in the
   RICDA field (Primary Mission) or Date of Change of Subarea Category Information
   (RICDF) (Secondary or Tertiary Missions). Composite/aggregate unit reports must be
   received within 96 hours of the oldest individual unit report RICDA.
50                                               AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009


     2.4.3. Report major equipment relocation(s) using the MEQLOCN set upon partial unit
     deployment or unit relocation. The reporting of all fields of the MEQLOCN set pertaining to
     operational ready status of aircraft and mission-ready status of crews will reflect the resources
     available within the applicable response times. See Attachment 5 for further guidance.
     2.4.4. CROs will report changes in unit location.
     2.4.5. CROs will submit waiver requests for reporting requirements or changes to reporting
     frequency through HQ USAF SORTS to the JS. Units submit their waiver requests
     through their respective MAJCOM FAM to the CRO.
     2.4.6. If there is no change to a unit’s status since their last report and a new report is due,
     show that data has been reviewed and is current by submitting a report consisting of the
     unit’s AFSORTSDET Overall Page with the RICDA and all remarks reflecting an updated
     date.
     2.4.7. INFO address all AUTODIN/DMS reports to ―HQ USAF SORTS REPORTS
     WASHINGTON DC//.‖ There is no requirement to submit an info copy when using File
     Transfer Protocol (FTP) to deliver messages to the GSORTS processor.
     2.4.8. CJCS policy allows assignment of overall status as of the report time or projection
     of status within the response time of up to 72 hours. Air Force units will report expected
     C-level status within the SORTS DOC Statement response time. The SORTS report will
     reflect the resources that are expected to be available within the DOC response time. Units
     can assume the following:
        2.4.8.1. The unit is in its actual deployed posture as dictated by current situation and
        existing JCS tasking orders. If committed to a smaller scale contingency, units may be
        released to refit and re-deploy to fill their full wartime mission set. Generally, units
        consider deployed resources to be available for their full wartime mission set
        (see para 2.8).
        2.4.8.2. The unit can conduct emergency recall of personnel, curtail scheduled
        maintenance/routine training unrelated to deployed posture, and increase work shift
        length.
        2.4.8.3. The delivery schedules for ordering items from outside agencies will not
        change from current projections.
     2.4.9. (Added-AFSOC) All unit reports are due by the second Wednesday of each month at
     2359Z. Measured unit SORTS monitors, SROs and COMREPs working together are
     responsible to ensure reports do not exceed 30 calendar days.
2.5. Forecasting Overall C-level Changes. Use this set whenever the Overall C-level is not a
―1‖, is an assessed Overall C-level (C-1X), a C-level change is predicted, or when the
Forecast Date of Change (CADAT) expires. If concrete indications of an impending change
in the unit’s Overall C-level exist, forecast what C-level the unit will change to (up or down) and
the date the unit will change C-levels. Units coordinate with their MAJCOMS for any assistance
needed.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                        51


   2.5.1. When a unit forecasts a change in its C-level, the unit must report both the Forecast
   Change Rating (CARAT) for Primary DOCs and the Forecast Subarea Change Rating
   (CARAF) for Secondary or Tertiary DOCs. Units must also report the estimated CADAT
   (Primary) and the Forecast Subarea Date of Change (CADAF) (Secondary or Tertiary).
   When a unit reports degraded C-levels and it is unable to forecast a change date, the
   responsible MAJCOM must provide the unit assistance to determine a best estimate
   forecast for insertion into the SORTS report. Forecasts are not required for units reporting
   C-1 that expect no change. If the reporting unit commander assesses the Overall C-level
   up to C-1X, the reporting unit must also report a CARAT and CADAT. The CARAT and
   CADAT fields must be updated every time a SORTS report is submitted.
   2.5.2. Forecast Remark. In addition to the CARAT and CADAT field information, a
   minimum of once every 30 days, unit commanders will provide a C-level forecast at 3, 6,
   and 12 months in a remark under the CADAT label. The remark will forecast the C-level
   at 3, 6, and 12-month points in time reflecting same number of forecasted days added
   to the RICDA date of the report. Fill in the AFSORTSDET Overall SORTS page
   following the example format below:
       2.5.2.1. Format the C-level forecasts as:
       (date) 3 MONTH FORECAST/2/P/P06/PERSONNEL PERMANENT CHANGE OF
       STATION (PCS) WITH NO REPLACEMENTS TRAINED
       6 MONTH FORECAST/1/NO EXPECTED PROBLEMS
       12 MONTH FORECAST/1/NO EXPECTED PROBLEMS
       2.5.2.2. Units desiring to report additional dates or information concerning forecasts
       may do so using a free-text remark. Remarks of this type are in addition to forecast
       comments and may be added immediately following the 12-month CADAT remark or
       by selecting the CADAT label from the remarks listing.
   2.5.3. (Added-AFSOC) If the CADAT field date expires before the next report is due,
   submit a new report updating the CADAT field. Submit the new report on or prior to the
   expiration date. Ensure the REASN remark is updated, giving an explanation for the
   extension of the expiration date, if required. If the FORECAST set is no longer required,
   delete it.
2.6. Limiting Factor(s) (LIMFAC). Within the scope of SORTS reporting, remarks must be
created to address any LIMFAC (unit problem) that affects the unit’s ability to accomplish its
wartime mission. A LIMFAC is a problem, deficiency, or condition that decreases or prevents a
unit from accomplishing its wartime mission, and which usually requires assistance from
higher headquarters to resolve. Issues of LIMFAC will be reported under the Current Overall
Category Level (READY) label. In addition to the READY remark, some LIMFAC may
require that they be reported using a remark label for the SORTS area affected and considered
when assigning unit C-levels (SORTS LIMFAC). SORTS LIMFAC may be reflected in the four
measured resource area C-levels, but may be reported throughout a unit’s SORTS report.
Examples of SORTS LIMFAC include; critical AFSC and equipment shortages, problems
with aircrew training, personnel experience levels, Mobility Readiness Spares Package (MRSP)
and In-Place Readiness Spares Package (IRSP) pacing item shortages, etc.
52                                              AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009


     2.6.1. Units experiencing a LIMFAC that they feel is not reportable in SORTS but
     requires higher headquarters direction will report in accordance with MAJCOM directives.
     2.6.2. LIMFAC impacting the unit’s ability to accomplish its mission(s) are classified at the
     level of the information contained per applicable directives. If no other directive governs the
     classification, the SORTS classification guidance applies.
2.7. Use of the Percent Effective (PCTEF) Field. PCTEF provides a subjective assessment of
the unit’s ability to execute its currently assigned nontraditional mission. When employed in
support of a nontraditional mission, commanders will report PCTEF. PCTEF reporting is
required upon receipt of an order to execute any of the following missions: Homeland Defense or
Homeland Security missions in support of USNORTHCOM and USPACOM (including quick
reaction force and/or ready reaction force missions), peacekeeeping or peace enforcement
operations, humanitarian assistance, consequence management, counterdrug operations, civil
distrubance operations, and natural disaster relief operations (including wildfire fighting
missions). In some cases, a unit executing assigned nontraditional operation will be executing its
wartime tasks in support of that nontraditional mission (e.g., a Civil Engineering unit providing
support to a natural disaster relief operation). In those cases, commanders will use their
discretion to determine if PCTEF reporting is required.
     2.7.1. PCTEF will not necessarily correlate with a unit’s Overall C-level. For example, if
     the unit is currently assigned a nontraditional mission, PCTEF will capture the commander’s
     assessment against this nontraditional mission while the Overall C-level will continue to
     assess the unit’s ability to execute its full wartime tasking(s). To report the impact on a
     unit’s C-level from deployed resources, commanders needs to use DEFG
     (see paragraph 2.8).
     2.7.2. When conditions for reporting PCTEF exist, home station units (SORTS reporting
     units only), who own the deployed resource(s) will begin reporting PCTEF upon
     assignment of a mission and issuance of a deployment warning order. Regardless of order
     receipt, PCTEF reporting commences no later than the deployment date and continues until
     unit mission requirements are changed or no longer exist.
        2.7.2.1. Units with multiple tasked or assigned deployment missions will reflect PCTEF
        ratings of the lowest assessed mission accompanied by the unit commander's remarks.
        2.7.2.2. Units will not report individual (single person) deployment tasking in PCTEF.
        2.7.2.3. Use the following definitions to report the commander’s estimate of unit ability
        to undertake one or more assigned missions for which the unit must deploy:
            2.7.2.3.1. Report a PCTEF level of 1 ('1' in PCTEF field) if the unit possesses the
            required resources and is trained to undertake the full mission(s) assigned.
            2.7.2.3.2. Report a PCTEF level of 2 ('2' in PCTEF field) if the unit possesses the
            required resources and is trained to undertake most of the mission(s) assigned.
            2.7.2.3.3. Report a PCTEF level of 3 ('3' in PCTEF field) if the unit possesses the
            required resources and is trained to undertake many, but not all portions of the
            mission(s) assigned mission.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                             53


           2.7.2.3.4. Report a PCTEF level of 4 ('4' in PCTEF field) if the unit requires
           additional resources or training to undertake the current mission(s) assigned. It may
           be directed to undertake portions of the current assigned mission with resources O/H.
           2.7.2.3.5. When no other requirement exists to report data in this field enter a
           question mark "?" to completely remove a previously reported entry.
   2.7.3. Commander’s remarks are mandatory when reporting in the PCTEF field. Using
   plain text under the PCTEF label, identify the mission assigned (e.g., Tsunami Relief
   Operations.) current status, and/or any action underway or planned to remedy a current
   reduced readiness condition for assigned missions. Format the PCTEF remark according to
   the example below:
        Percent Effective (2), Tsunami Relief Operations, status reflects reduced/increased
        effectiveness due to reason(s), e.g., Tsunami Relief Operations deployment tasking
        cannot be fully supported due to shortage of (personnel, equipment and supplies o/h,
        equipment condition, and/or training). To alleviate the situation on (area), the unit will
        (action). Get well date (gwd) is estimated to be (date). Estimated departure/return date
        is (date).
   2.7.4. (Added-AFSOC) AFSOC units who deploy to multiple locations will identify those
   locations within the PCTEF remark and provide a PCTEF level for each location.
2.8. Policy for Units with Deployed Resources. When assets of a measured unit are deployed
(partially deployed), the parent unit will normally report status on these resources in its C-level.
   2.8.1. When part of a unit is deployed in support of an operation you may count resources as
   available under the following conditions:
       2.8.1.1. For units with mobility only or a dual, in-place generation and mobility
       mission(s): if they are capable of being ready to redeploy from their current location
       within the DOC response time.
       2.8.1.2. For units with an in-place generation mission: if they are capable of redeploying
       to their home station and generating within response time. Generally units with in-place
       generation missions will not be able to redeploy to home station and generate within their
       response time.
       2.8.1.3. Regardless of gaining or losing resources, if the unit reports less than C-1, enter
       the reason under the SECRN label and use remarks to emphasize increase or reduction
       in required and assigned resources because of deployment to build up or augment
       resources. When resources partially deployed are counted as available (could be
       redeployed within response time), see the expanded reason codes in Table 2.6.
       2.8.1.4. Expanded reason codes D, E, F, or G (DEFG) will be used to reflect the
       commander’s assessment of the percent of unit deployable capability that is currently
       deployed. This information is used to assess risk of resources not being made available to
       redeploy. Refer to Table 2.6 for an explanation of these expanded reason codes.

         2.8.1.5. Supported CCs require readiness information specific to a unit’s ability to meet
         employment tasking. Therefore, MAJCOMs must ensure their deployed units meet the
         supported commanders’ information needs through utilization of unit commander
         assessments of PCTEF.
     2.8.2. HQ USAF/XOOA, in coordination with the JS, will decide, on a case-by-case basis,
     the extent of reporting for units deployed to operate; in a stand-alone capacity; as a
     temporary or provisional unit; and units which transfer, loan, or supplement personnel or
     supplies (e.g., resources turned in to personnel or supply system) from several units to form
     a temporary or provisional unit.

      Available (TPAVL) fields, respectively.
      2.10.2.4. Critical Personnel Required/Authorized (CPAUR), Assigned (CPASG), and
      Available (CPAVL) fields, respectively.
   2.10.3. Chapter 4, also AFMAN 23-110, ―USAF Supply Manual,‖ Volume II, Part Two,
   Chapter 26 (WRM information), use for SORTS procedures to check the Equipment and
   Supplies O/H Category Level (S-level) data elements:
      2.10.3.1. S-Level and its reason code in the Measured Resource Area Level for
      Equipment/Supplies O/H (ESRAT) and Primary Reason Measured Resource Area Level
      for Equipment/Supplies O/H Not C-1 (ESRES) fields.

     elements:
        2.10.4.1. R-Level and its reason code in the Measured Resource Area Level for
        Equipment Condition (ERRAT) and Primary Reason Measured Resource Area Level

        Training Subarea (TRSA) percentages 1 through 5 fields, as per Chapter 6.
2.11. Preparing Narrative Remarks. Remarks are a critical component of SORTS and are
required whenever a measured resource subarea percentage drives a measured area level less
than 1, i.e., P-1 (Personnel), S-1 (Equipment), R-1 (Equipment Condition) or T-1 (Training)/
(See Table 2.4, Remarks Guidance Matrix). Remarks will progressively highlight problem areas
for each individual label regardless of whether the reported percentage is the actual driver of the
measured area level, e.g., a unit has equipment and supplies problems in ESSA3 and
equipment condition problems reported in ERSA2 and ERSA4. First an individual remark will
be written for each one of these labels. Then a remark, in some cases the same, will be listed in
the next higher label of both areas. IAW the above that would be the ESRES and ERRES
labels. For the ESRES the same ESSA3 remark will be used. For the ERRES a combination of the
ERSA2 and ERSA4 labels will be added. Lastly, a compilation of all the labels remarked on
(ESSA3, ERSA2, ERSA4, ESRES, and ERRES) will be given in the REASN label. Remarks will
be written in conjunction with the following:
     2.11.1. Use remarks to give supplemental information concerning unit Overall C-level, or
     measured area level, and SORTS LIMFAC. Remarks must be checked and verified for
     accuracy each time any portion of a report is submitted. Revise content and remark date as
     necessary to maintain validity. Remove remarks that no longer apply. If no change in
     content, revise the remark date to prevent it from exceeding 30 days from the last revision
     or when a full report or a partial report that contains remarks is submitted. Remarks will
     never be more than 31 days old.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                          57


  2.11.2. As previously described, progressively report on each label requiring a remark.
  SORTS customers often selectively retrieve specific pieces of data from the database and
  need to know the location of the remark that explains the data they retrieve. Write remarks in
  plain English. Acronyms must be defined in each remark area in which it is used. Additional
  uses of a defined acronym in the same remark may reflect only the acronym. As SORTS is
  dynamic and remarks may change from report to report, do not refer to previous message
  numbers. Do not submit remarks referencing other remarks (e.g. See REASN remark), each
  remark must stand on its own content or it will defeat the specific data retrieval programs. In
  general, list resource types with their problems. State numbers required, assigned, and
  available, explain the cause of the problem, if known, identify previously requested
  assistance and remedial actions in progress, highlight further actions required, and supply a
  date of expected change for better or worse (see 2.11.5 for GWD specifics).
  2.11.3. Remarks must contain a layperson’s explanation of the problem and its mission
  impact for customers to understand the unit's situation. Remarks must also contain a detailed
  functional explanation of the situation to provide details needed for functional management.
  2.11.4. Explain unit and wing actions taken to resolve shortcomings. State if, and what kind
  of, higher headquarters action is needed.
  2.11.5. Provide a realistic GWD for each shortfall or problem in each remark. Use the day,
  month and year (DDMMMYY) date format, i.e. 01JAN02. If GWD is Unknown, contact
  the applicable MAJCOM FAM for assistance in establishing a GWD.
  2.11.6. Remarks should be clear and concise, but not at the expense of the details
  needed. Each remark can be up to 5000 characters long.
     2.11.6.1. (Added-AFSOC) Do not use the ―remarks section‖ when directing questions
     to MAJCOMs or requesting MAJCOM assistance. Questions/requests for assistance
     should be up-channeled to the applicable office via DSN or message. Should you have
     difficulty locating the appropriate office, please contact HQ AFSOC/A3OR.
         2.11.6.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) When a unit is less than a ―C-1‖, overall or in any
         measured area, they are required to provide an estimate get well date (EGWD) of
         when they will reach the next higher category-levels.
         2.11.6.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) If a situation arises where a unit can never reach the
         next higher C-level due to math, not availability, then this must be thoroughly
         explained in the REASN remark.
  2.11.7. For the Personnel area, explain the following areas:
     2.11.7.1. Write a remark using the PRRES label (Primary Reason Measured Resource
     Subarea Level for Personnel Not C-1 (PRREF) for Secondary or Tertiary Missions) to
     discuss the personnel area when less then P-1.
         2.11.7.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) When providing Personnel measured area forecasting,
         use P-level verbiage. For example:

               EGWD TO P-2: 15 JUN 06
               EGWD TO P-1: 15 AUG 06
58                                          AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009


        2.11.7.1.2. (Added)(AFSOC) AFSOC communication units will submit a PRRES
        remark in accordance with the following format:

          UTC/REQ/ASGN/AVAIL/P-LEVEL

     2.11.7.2. When directed to include DoD civilian employees (contractors will not be
     measured) in P-level measurements, report total and critical numbers authorized,
     assigned, and available in a remark using the PRRES label. When commander-assessing
     the Overall C-level, if the availability of any non-measured contract personnel or
     assigned DoD personnel are used to support that assessment, factor in the
     non-availability of those who are obligated to the reserve components during crisis or
     wartime. Describe the services they would have provided in a remark using the PRRES
     label. Contract employee availability due to labor action or failure to perform impacting
     mission should also be explained in detail.
     2.11.7.3. UTC/UMD mismatches exist when one or more of the following conditions
     occur: UTC requirements exceed UMD authorizations or UTC skill and/or grades cannot
     be matched after all authorized substitutions have been considered. When UTC/UMD
     mismatches reflect a shortage in any AFSC, identify shortfalls in a remark in the
     PRRAT label by listing each involved; UTC, AFSC, number of personnel required by
     UTC, and number of personnel authorized by UMD. To identify shortfalls, compare the
     most current UTC as indicated on the SORTS DOC Statement with the most current
     UMD authorizations. Compare these documents for mismatches. A comparison report is
     available through the Wing Manpower Office upon request. In the event of
     UTC/UMD mismatches, see paragraph 3.6.1 for measurement calculation requirements.
        2.11.7.3.1. (Added-AFSOC) UTC/UMD mismatch shortages need only be reported
        when the UTC requirement exceeds the UMD authorizations. UMD authorizations in
        excess of UTC requirements are normal and should not be reported. All supporting
        documentation must be kept on hand.
     2.11.7.4. Regardless of P-level, if personnel shortages exist, identify them in a remark
     using the PERTP label by listing each involved; AFSC, number of personnel
     authorized or required, assigned, available, in upgrade training (UGT), the identifying
     personnel reason code (PRC), corrective actions, and a GWD for each;
     ―AFSC/REQ/ASGN/AVAIL /UGT/PRC.‖ Include a discussion of action(s) taken to
     resolve the problem. Use Chapter 3, Table 3.5, to indicate applicable PRCs.
        2.11.7.4.1. (Added-AFSOC) Utilize the PERTP remark to account for AFSC and
        skill level shortages, include a reason for shortages and actions taken to resolve the
        shortfall. In the RMKS column, clearly describe all skill-level substitutions if there
        are still shortages after the substitutions.
            2.11.7.4.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) If all shortages are filled with skill-level
            substitutions, the AFSC should not be identified as having shortages in the
            PERTP remark.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                    59


            2.11.7.4.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) Format the personnel remark in accordance with
            the example below:

                 (DDMMMYY) PROBLEM AFSCS
                 AFSC/POSITION/REQ/ASGN/AVAIL/UGT/PRC/RMKS/EGWD:
                 1A251/LOADMASTER/12/7/8/2/P40/2 DNIF, 2 PME, FIVE 7-LEVELS

                 2W071/WEAPONS/10/17/17/5/P40/2 INBOUND/30OCT09

                Note: This example shows the unit has a requirement for 12 five-level
                loadmasters; using seven-level substitution, the unit is short four
                loadmasters.
     2.11.7.5. (Added-AFSOC) Flying squadrons will provide a breakdown of total critical
     aircrew personnel positions (Ops), total critical maintenance (MX) and life support
     personnel authorized/assigned/available/EGWD in the PERTC remark. Include a
     breakdown of all crew positions to include authorized, assigned and available by crew
     position. Also include all Mission Ready Crews (MRC). When any shortages exist,
     explain reason, corrective action and EGWD. Format the aircrew remark according to
     the example below:

         (DDMMMYY) CREW BREAKDOWN
         OPS PERS AUTH/ASGN/AVAIL: 165/160/135

         ATTACHED PERSONNEL CAN BE USED TO FORM 2 ADDITIONAL
         CREWS.

        2.11.7.5.1. (Added-AFSOC) The MRC portion of the PERTC remark will only
        reflect the unit’s assigned crew numbers. The MRC of the remark will not include
        attached personnel; however, the additional number of crews that can be formed
        using attached personnel may be listed at the bottom of the PERTC remark (only
60                                            AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009


            after considering whether the attached personnel are available to support the UTC
            tasking).
            2.11.7.5.2. (Added-AFSOC) Show crews with attached personnel in the
            MEQLOCN sets, using CREWF and CRMRC fields in accordance with
            paragraph 1.6.8.1.

     2.11.8. For the Equipment and Supplies O/H area, explain the following:
        2.11.8.1. Write a remark using the ESRES label (Primary Reason Measured Resource
        Subarea Level for Equipment and Supplies Not C-1 (ESREF) for Secondary or Tertiary
        Missions) when equipment and supplies O/H is less than S-1. Ensure each subarea field,
        reflecting a percentage of ―less than 90%,‖ is described in the associated remark label;
        e.g., ESSA4. Ensure remarks accurately reflect the specified reason code (Table 4.5) and
        contain all pertinent details such as readiness driver national stock number (NSN),
        item data, get-well date, kit serial number (as applicable), on-hand versus authorized
        quantities, POC, etc. Remarks for each allowance standard equipment shortage resulting
        in a LIMFAC must contain the NSN, quantity short, allowance source code (ASC),
        equipment account number, and an account custodian POC.
            2.11.8.1.1. If Electronic Countermeasure (ECM) pods O/H and mission ready are less
            than 90 percent, provide a remark on ECM pod status using the ESSA4 label.
            2.11.8.1.2. The status of medical WRM project codes not reported in subareas are
            provided using the ESRES label. No remarks are required other than the project code
            and percent filled from the Stock Status Report (i.e., BA: 67%).
        2.11.8.2. Write a remark using the Major Equipment Possessed (MEPSD) label to
        account for a flying unit’s aircraft assigned but not possessed. Report the number of
        assigned backup aircraft inventory (BAI) aircraft total, the tail number and location of
        aircraft in programmed depot maintenance (PDM), on loan to or from another unit, and
        estimated return date(s).
            2.11.8.2.1. Using AFSORTSDET,         format   the   aircraft   summary    narrative
            according to the example below:

            (date) AIRCRAFT SUMMARY
            AUTHORIZED 16, ASSIGNED 10, POSSESSED 7
            TAIL / LOCATION/ REASON         / ESTIMATED RETURN DATE
            00452 / MBPB     / PDM           / 23JAN03
            80217 / MBPB     / SPEEDLINE / 23SEP02


            2.11.8.2.2. In the aircraft summary, UAV units will report the number of systems
            authorized, assigned and possessed.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                     61


     2.11.8.3. In a RICDA remark, report mobility A-bags (general use) and B-bags (cold
     weather), see AFMAN 23-110 for a list of minimum compositions. Remark will be
     formatted as follows:
      (Date) MOBILITY BAGS
      TYPE          AUTH/REQ               ONHAND
      A-BAG              10                   10

     2.11.8.4. (Added-AFSOC) When multiple sub-areas limit the S-level, the ESRES label
     will be used for summarizations with actual data reported in the sub-area remarks. When
     providing Equipment and Supplies On-Hand measured area forecasting use S-level
     verbiage. For example:

              EGWD TO S-2: 15 JUN 06
              EGWD TO S-1: 15 AUG 06

        2.11.8.4.1. (Added-AFSOC) In each sub-area with a deficiency, list the equipment
        authorized or required and equipment possessed or on-hand for the applicable ESSA
        field.
        2.11.8.4.2. (Added-AFSOC) ESSA remarks listing equipment shortages must be in
        the following format:

             LABEL/S/A/LABEL:ESSA#//
             GENTEXT/YYMMDD SHORTAGE OF EQUIPMENT
             NAME AUTH       ONHAND  EGWD     RMKS

             Note: Units should add a narrative to further describe the shortages.
     2.11.8.5. (Added-AFSOC) AFSOC communication units will submit an ESRES remark
     in accordance with the following format: UTC/PROBLEM PARTS/S-LEVEL/EGWD.
     Units should add a narrative to further describe the shortages.
     2.11.8.6. (Added-AFSOC) Aircraft units will account for all mission aircraft in the
     unit’s inventory, to include Back-up Aircraft Inventory (BAI). Use the following
     example to format the remark:

          TYPE/AUTH/ASGN/PSD/AVAIL
          PAA MH-53M           10    10   8     7

              5556/SOUDA BAY, GREECE/JCET TRAINING/15 JUL 08

             Note: The definition of ERD is: estimated return date.
            2.11.8.8.1. (Added-AFSOC) Aircraft units with multiple MRSPs will report each
            MRSP capability in the EQSSE remark. Base the S-level on the aircraft availability
            (ACFTA) 30-day percentage. Format the MRSP capabilities remark in accordance
            with the example below:

                 (DDMMMYY) MULTIPLE UTC CAPABILITIES
                 MRSP/PAA/ACFTA PERCENTAGE/S-LEVEL:
                 XAAX1/6/100/S-1
                 XAAX2/2/100/S-1
                 XAAX3/2/50/S-2

     2.11.9. For the Equipment Condition area, explain the following:
        2.11.9.1. Write a remark using the ERRES label (Primary Reason Measured Resource
        Area Level for Equipment Condition Not C-1 (ERREF) for Secondary or Tertiary
        Missions) when equipment and supplies condition is less than R-1. Ensure each
        subarea field reflecting a percentage ―less than 90% ‖ status is described in the
        associated remark label; e.g., ERSA4.
        2.11.9.2. Additionally, aircraft units will provide explanatory remarks for conditions less
        than 75 percent in the ERRES label.
        2.11.9.3. (Added-AFSOC) When multiple sub-areas limit the R-level, the ERRES label
        will be used for summarizations with actual data reported in the sub-area remarks. When
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                            63


     providing Equipment Condition measured area forecasting, use R-level verbiage. For
     example:

           EGWD TO R-2: 15 JUN 06
           EGWD TO R-1: 15 AUG 06

         2.11.9.3.1. (Added-AFSOC) In each sub-area with a deficiency, list the equipment
         deficiency for the applicable ERSA field. This must include number of unserviceable
         pieces of equipment.
         2.11.9.3.2. (Added-AFSOC) ERSA remarks must show equipment condition
         deficiencies in the following format:

          LABEL/S/A/LABEL:ERSA#//
          GENTEXT/YYMMDD EQUIPMENT DEFICIENCY
          NAME       AUTH      ON HAND NO. DEFICIENT                             EGWD

         Note: Units should add a narrative to further describe the shortages.
     2.11.9.4. (Added-AFSOC) AFSOC communication units will submit an ERRES
     remark in accordance with the following format:           UTC/PROBLEM
     PARTS/R-LEVEL/EGWD. Units should add a narrative to further describe the
     shortages.
  2.11.10. For the Training area, identify the primary cause of training program limitations.
     2.11.10.1. Write a remark using the TRRES label (Primary Reason Measured Resource
     Subarea Level for Training Not C-1 (TRREF) for Secondary or Tertiary Missions) when
     the training condition is less than T-1. Write remarks for each subarea reported as less
     than 85%; e.g., TRSA1 for units using Method C, Option 1 or 2.
     2.11.10.2. Regardless of training method and option, when multiple subareas are less
     than T-1, summarize problems in a remark using the TRRES and/or TRREF labels.
     Ensure each subarea field reflecting a ―less than T-1‖ status is described in an individual
     label remark, also regardless of method used.
         2.11.10.2.1. (Added-AFSOC) When multiple sub-areas limit the T-level, the
         TRRES label will be used for summarizations with actual data reported in the
         sub-area remarks. When providing Training measured area forecasting, use T-level
         verbiage. For example:

          EGWD TO T-2: 15 JUN 06
          EGWD TO T-1: 15 AUG 06
64                                              AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009


               2.11.10.2.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) AFSOC communication units will submit a
               TRRES remark in accordance with the following format:

                     UTC/REQ/AVAIL/T-LEVEL/EGWD

               2.11.10.2.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) AFSOC units will submit the TRSA remarks in
               the following format:

                POSITION/AFSC/ASSIGN/TRND/RMKS/EGWD.

               Note: The maximum number of personnel reflected in the assigned column will
               not exceed the number of personnel authorized or required by UTCs. Aviation
               units only need to list the driving crew position in the TRSA area as applicable.
        2.11.10.3. When current or forecast Air Education and Training Command (AETC)
        formal training school allocation deficiencies exist, write a remark using the TRRAT
        label. Begin the narrative remark with ―AETC:‖ followed by the deficiency short title,
        and continue with a detailed summary of current or future deficiency, the current
        status or action taken to resolve the deficiency, additional actions required, and the
        impact on the unit’s ability to undertake its wartime mission. Using AFSORTSDET,
        format the AETC formal training school allocation deficiency narrative according to
        the example below:
         (date) AETC: (list short title deficiency or future requirement)
         CURRENT STATUS/ACTION
         ADDITIONAL ACTIONS
         IMPACT ON UNIT
         FUTURE REQUIREMENT(S)
        2.11.10.4. When required, CE units report the last date the unit attended Silver Flag
        Training using the TRSA3 remark label.
     2.11.11. Overall C-level data must be explained in a REASN label remark (Overall Reason
     Unit Subarea is Not C-1 (REASF) for Secondary or Tertiary Missions). The remark should
     summarize problems in sufficient detail to ascertain unit readiness and prompt review of
     specific measured area remarks. The following situational examples would require a
     remark:
        2.11.11.1. Which mission(s) the unit cannot fully support or undertake when its Overall
        C-level is less than C-1.
        2.11.11.2. The commander’s rationale, supporting a subjectively assessed C-level and
        area(s) where the commander disagrees with the measured area C-level.
            2.11.11.2.1. (Added-AFSOC) Unit commanders are precluded by the AFSOC/CC
            from subjectively assessing up. However, unit commanders may continue to assess
            down. Rationale for the assessment must be included.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                        65


     2.11.11.3. The programmed or estimated date the unit will again be able to undertake
     its major wartime mission if less than C-1 or after undergoing a major equipment
     conversion or transition.
     2.11.11.4. The deactivation date planned for the unit. If within one year of deactivation,
     do not list personnel shortages unless specifically instructed to do so by the MAJCOM.
     2.11.11.5. When a unit fails an ORI or NSI, consider a commander assessed
     downgrade to the unit’s Overall C-level until the deficiency causing the unsatisfactory
     rating is resolved. Units may assume successful re-inspection; when it is required and
     the inspection team provides applicable dates. Provide remarks to explain the condition
     in the REASN and/or REASF labels.
  2.11.12. Using the RICDA label, all SORTS reporting units will include a written remark in
  each Primary, Secondary, and/or Tertiary database supplying the full rank and name of their
  primary and alternate SORTS monitors. Minimum entry will include contact telephone
  number(s) and e-mail address(s). Current DOC Statement date will be included as the final
  line of text. EXAMPLE: SORTS MONITORS FOR THE 123XFW ARE PRIMARY TSGT
  JOHN DOE. ALTERNATES SSGT JANE DOE AND A1C MAY JUNE.
  DSN 999-8888/ 7777. E-MAIL 123XFW@EXAMPLE.AF.MIL. Current DOC Statement
  date: DDMMMYY.
  2.11.13. (Added-AFSOC) REASN remarks must identify all measured areas less than ―1‖,
  respectively.
     2.11.13.1. (Added-AFSOC) If a commander assesses the overall C-level, it must be
     listed first. As long as all areas less than C-1 are listed in the REASN remark, the order
     of those areas is up to discretion of the unit commander.
     2.11.13.2. (DELETED-AFSOC)
         2.11.13.2.1. (DELETED-AFSOC)
     2.11.13.3. (Added-AFSOC) Format the REASN remark in accordance with the

        B-BAGS               3500               3500              NONE

        2.11.14.1. (Added-AFSOC) Mobility bags are considered ―on-hand‖ if an individual
        within the unit has possession of them (e.g. deployed).
2.12. Overall Reason Codes.
     2.12.1. Assigning a Primary Reason Code (PRC). Units must report a reason code against the
     Overall C-level using the reason codes in Table 2.5, unless reporting C-1. When
     partially deployed, use DEFG (See Table 2.7 for additional clarification on use of PRCs).
     2.12.2. Reporting a PRC. The PRC will be entered in the REASN and/or REASF fields.
        2.12.2.1. When the Overall C-Level is less than C-1, pick that resource area most
        affecting the lowered C-Level. Use P for personnel, S for equipment and supplies O/H,
        R for equipment condition, and T for training.
        2.12.2.2. If the Overall C-Level (14) is changed by commander assessment the
        X reason code will be used. See paragraph 2.13 for supporting reason codes.
            2.12.2.2.1. If the Overall C-level is based on commander assessment of partial
            deployment capability, up or down, the X reason code will be used under the REASN
            remark label and the DEFG will be placed in the SECRN field. Detailed
            deployment remarks under the REASN remark label will be included to reflect
            DEFG, the percentage of the unit’s deployable capability that is currently deployed,
            and the rationale for the commander’s change to the calculated C-Level.
            2.12.2.2.2. If the Overall C-level is based solely on measured area calculations
            (REASN not X and not C-1) and the unit is partially deployed P, S, R, or T will be
            placed in REASN and the DEFG as described below will be placed in the SECRN
            field. A detailed explanation will be included under the REASN remark label. Using
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                         67



           AFSORTSDET, format the reason summary narrative according the example below:
            (date) PARTIAL UNIT DEPLOYMENT
            REASON CODE (E)/6 F-16 DEPLOYED TO BASE X FOR OPERATION ABC; 1
            60K
            AIRCRAFT LOADER AND 2 10K ALL-TERRAIN FORKLIFTS DEPLOYED TO
            BASE Y
            FOR HUMANITARIAN SUPPORT OPERATIONS; 16 SECURITY PERSONNEL
            DEPLOYED TO BASE Z FOR HUMANITARIAN SUPPORT OPERATIONS.
       2.12.2.3. If the Overall C-Level is C-1, there is no partial deployment reflected
       (no DEFG needed), and one or more of the resource areas are not measured (reported as
       code 6), the 6 reason code will be used. No remarks are required for a 6 reason code.
       2.12.2.4. If the Overall C-Level is capped by AF FAMs, (i.e., due to resource
       allocation) below C-1, enter the maximum level possible in the Category Level
       Limitation (LIM) label for primary missions (Category Level Subarea Limitation
       (LIMF) for secondary or tertiary missions) in the CATLIM set. Enter a P, S, R, or T in
       the Reason for Category Level Limitation (RLIM) label for the area most affected by the
       resource allocation (Reason for Category Level Subarea Limitation (RLIMF) label for
       secondary or tertiary missions).
2.13. Assigning a Secondary or Tertiary Reason Code. The Overall C-Level is changed by
the commander, enter X in REASN field and assign a secondary code to explain the primary
reason for the decision to change the C-level (See Table 2.7 for additional clarification on use
of secondary and tertiary reason codes).
   2.13.1. When upgrading, use the codes: PUP for personnel, SUP for equipment and
   supplies O/H, RUP for equipment condition, and TUP for training.
   2.13.2. When downgrading, use the applicable reason code in Chapter 3, Chapter 4,
   Chapter 5, and Chapter 6. Do not use PUP, SUP, RUP, or TUP when downgrading.
   2.13.3. SECRN is mandatory if REASN equals X or if Overall is less than 1 and DEFG is
   reported in REASN and/or REASF fields.
   2.13.4. TERRN will be used if REASN equals X and SECRN equals DEFG when
   READY is less than 1 (Tertiary Reason Unit is Not C-1 (TERRF) field for Secondary or
   Tertiary Missions).

Section 2C—Air Force Unique Data

2.14. Special Mission Capability Data. Special mission capabilities are tasks, equipment, and
missions listed in Table 2.3. Generally, they add flexibility to mission accomplishment and
require specialized equipment or training. The SORTS DOC Statement will state which
special mission capabilities to include in C-Level calculations. It will also state where to
report data on up to four specific capabilities. For each special mission capability:
   2.14.1. Determine the SMCC by using Table 2.3. Enter the code under the SMCC 1 through
   4 fields, as applicable.
68                                                AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009


     2.14.2. Determine the number of aircraft required to have the capability. Use the SORTS
     DOC Statement to find the number required to have the specialized equipment. Enter the
     number under Special Mission Required Aircraft (SMRA) 1 through 4 fields, as applicable.
     2.14.3. Count the number of aircraft mission ready and available with the special
     capability. Count only those aircraft mission ready and available and have the required
     specialized equipment mission ready and available according to paragraph 5.7. Enter the
     number under the Special Mission Aircraft Available (SMAA) 1 through 4 fields, as
     applicable.
     2.14.4. Determine the number of crews required to have the specialized training. Use the
     SORTS DOC Statement to determine the number required and enter the number under the
     Special Mission Required Crews (SMRC) 1 through 4 fields, as applicable.
     2.14.5. Count the number of mission ready and available crews with specialized training.
     Count only those crews with specialized training which are mission ready and available
     according to paragraph 6.2.3. Enter the number under the Special Mission Available
     Crews (SMAC) 1 thorough 4 fields, as applicable.
     2.14.6. (Added-AFSOC) For SORTS reporting, Special Capability (SPECAP) crews are
     those requiring special training beyond basic qualifications and apply to only a portion of the
     unit’s crews. Special training that applies to all crews (e.g. in-flight refueling, receiver) will
     be factored into combat mission ready crew calculations.
        2.14.6.1. (Added-AFSOC) Special mission capability aircraft are modified for a type of
        mission other aircraft of the same mission design series (MDS) cannot perform. Because
        AFSOC does not have a ―select few‖ aircraft within any MDS, special operations forces
        (SOF) units do not need to account for special mission airframes.
     2.14.7. (Added-AFSOC) Until Table 2.3, Special Mission Capability Codes for SMCC 1-4
     Field Use, is updated in AFI 10-201 Code 64 is designated UAS Expeditionary Launch and
     Recovery.
2.15. CBDRT Reporting. To report the status of unit required/authorized CBDRT equipment
and training, see Attachment 4. All measured units will complete a CBDRT report concurrent
with the unit’s primary SORTS report.

                           PERSONNEL MEASURED AREA DATA

3.1. Personnel. A critical part of SORTS readiness reporting is the status of the unit’s
personnel resources. Units compute the personnel P-level based on the percentages of total
and critical personnel available to accomplish the unit’s required wartime mission. For units
with an in-place or dual (in place and mobility) wartime mission, personnel wartime
requirements are based on authorized funded positions in their UMDs. For units with mobility
only missions, the requirements are the manpower details of their UTC(s). The following
documents are used as sources for the personnel measured area: MEML, UMD, SORTS
Personnel Availability Roster, and the MANFOR UTC Detail Report from the Manpower
Personnel Module Base-Level (MANPER-B) system. Personnel measurement is limited to US
military and specified DoD civilian personnel. Foreign national military, foreign national
civilian, and contractor personnel are not counted in the measured personnel area. Active duty
units will not count ANG and Reserve personnel unless gained by the unit as a result of
mobilization.
     3.1.1. Total Personnel.
        3.1.1.1. TPAUTH for all units is based on the unit’s UMD and/or its DOC required
        UTCs.
            3.1.1.1.1. For units with an in-place generation mission or an in-place generation and
            mobility mission (see unit DOC Statement), the source document for TPAUTH is
            the unit’s UMD. MAJCOMs must provide instructions to their units on how to
            identify wartime-required and funded positions, i.e. a DOC instruction of "Measure
            and report the availability of unit personnel to fill all funded military positions in your
            UMD.‖
            3.1.1.1.2. For units with a mobility only mission (see unit DOC Statement),
            TPAUTH is the total of the manpower requirements identified in the deployment
            UTC(s) the unit is required to support. Contact the local manpower office for a UTC
            Manpower Detail Report for each UTC.
        3.1.1.2. TPASG is determined by counting all personnel in a unit from the time they
        arrive at the unit until they depart on a PCS, permanent change of assignment (PCA), or
        separate from the Air Force. All personnel are counted for TPASG regardless of AFSC,
        skill level, or grade and may exceed the TPAUTH number. Units will use a unit
        manpower personnel roster (UMPR) or similar product provided by their CSS or Military
        Personnel Flight (MPF) to determine total assigned personnel. Before preparing the
        SORTS report, the unit SORTS monitor should coordinate with the unit CSS to ensure
        records in the Personnel System are updated and reflect the true status of unit personnel.
        3.1.1.3. TPAVL is determined by calculating the number of TPASG that are available to
        the unit within the DOC response time and are able to perform the assigned mission
        (see paragraph 3.2 for specific availability guidance). TPAVL are counted regardless of
        AFSC, skill level, or grade and may exceed the TPAUTH number.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                       77


     3.1.1.4. DoD Civilian Personnel can be included in personnel counts when they
     occupy     wartime-required     positions.  Only     Emergency      Essential  (EE)
     (IAW AFI 10-231, ―Federal Civilian Deployment Guide”) and ―Key‖ DoD civilians
     (IAW AFI 36-507, ―Mobilization of the Civilian Workforce”) are included in
     calculations in the SORTS personnel area. Other DoD civilian and general contractor
     personnel impacting a unit’s readiness may be reported on as part of the commander’s
     assessment.
         3.1.1.4.1. Do not count civilian personnel in SORTS if they have Reserve or Guard
         commitments during crisis or wartime that can make them subject to recall.
         3.1.1.4.2. MAJCOMs must mark SORTS DOC Statements to include United States
         (US) DoD civilian personnel in the personnel measurement area when they are part of
         the unit’s wartime requirement (either by occupying wartime required authorizations
         and/or as part of the unit’s deployment UTCs). A remark on SORTS DOC
         Statements should indicate if and how a civilian occupation code converts to a
         military AFSC.
     3.1.1.5. Foreign Local Nationals will not be counted in SORTS due to questionable
     availability during wartime contingencies.
  3.1.2. Critical Personnel.
     3.1.2.1. The reporting of critical personnel is based on the AFSC’s identified by the
     HQ USAF functional area manager as detailed in Table 3.1. Personnel with particular
     AFSCs are considered ―critical‖ if they meet the following criteria:
         3.1.2.1.1. Personnel with AFSC(s) that are essential to fulfilling the unit’s wartime
         mission tasks.
         3.1.2.1.2. Absence of personnel possessing AFSC(s) that would render the unit
         severely deficient or totally unable to execute its wartime mission.
         3.1.2.1.3. AFSC is part of a critically manned career field subject to special
         monitoring.
     3.1.2.2. Officers who have a critical AFSC as their duty or primary AFSC, or enlisted
     who have a critical AFSC as their primary or control AFSC are considered critical.
     3.1.2.3. Enlisted members who are cross training and hold a 3-level control AFSC in
     their new career field present a special circumstance. Those personnel can be
     counted against critical requirements in their former career field so long as they hold
     the correct primary or control AFSC and skill level, their grade meets or exceeds the
     UMD requirement, and their commander determines they are qualified to perform the
     job.
     3.1.2.4. CPAUR is determined by counting the number of TPAUTH positions that also
     match the AFSC/skill levels listed in Table 3.1.
78                                              AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009


        3.1.2.5. CPASG is determined by counting the number of critical personnel authorized
        positions that can be filled by a qualified person. To count as qualified, the person must
        have the required AFSC and meet or exceed the required skill level. An officer must
        have the correct duty AFSC and grade and enlisted personnel must have the correct
        control or primary AFSC/skill level compared to the critical position requirement.
        Critical Personnel who are surplus to the unit’s critical personnel requirement in an
        AFSC will not be counted as part of the critical personnel assignment unless they can be
        used to fill a requirement shortage IAW authorized substitutions as defined below:
            3.1.2.5.1. AFSC substitution: AFSC Substitution of critical personnel is only
            allowed when authorized by UTC MISCAP, WMP-1 Functional Annexes, or
            Functional AFIs.
            3.1.2.5.2. Skill-level substitution: The UTC MISCAP, functional AFIs, or the USAF
            WMP-1 annexes govern authorized skill-level substitutions. Substitutions will
            only be made when authorized! IAW CJCSM 3150.02, critical personnel
            substitutions must have the required AFSC and meet or exceed the skill level
            required. Commanders should review the qualifications of any substitutes to ensure
            the UTC requirement is not degraded. Once review is made, substitutes may be
            included in critical calculations.
                3.1.2.5.2.1. (Added-AFSOC) For enlisted aircrew positions, AFSOC flying
                units are authorized to use standard skill-level substitution. Substitutions must be
                accomplished in accordance with AFI 10-401 and AFI 10-403. Only those
                individuals who are trained and qualified to perform the duties at the substituted
                skill-level may be used in skill-level substitution.
                3.1.2.5.2.2. (Added-AFSOC) Pilots qualified in an MDS may be substituted for
                co-pilots in the same MDS.
        3.1.2.6. CPAVL is determined by calculating the number of CPASG that are available to
        the unit within the DOC response time and are able to perform the assigned mission
        (see paragraph 3.2 for specific availability guidance).
        3.1.2.7. Critical Personnel overages will not be reported in the CPASG and CPAVL
        data fields but may be reported using a remark under the applicable label (CPASG or
        CPAVL).
     3.1.3. Special Provisions for Personnel Counting.
        3.1.3.1. The SORTS DOC Statement must indicate whether DSU personnel must be
        included in the count.
        3.1.3.2. Units with multiple weapon systems will allocate resources to meet the wartime
        requirements of each system.
        3.1.3.3. Personnel TDY or temporarily attached to a measured unit will not be
        included in the gaining unit’s assigned and available numbers.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                          79


      3.1.3.4. Total force organizations or units with a joint mission that have multiple service
      personnel assigned, attached or a combination of active duty and reserve component
      personnel will use their respective service or component unit UMD to determine total
      personnel requirements, e.g., a total force wing requires support from the Army, Navy,
      and Air National Guard. The Army operating location (OL) has a UMD of
      20 personnel, the Navy OL 20 personnel, the ANG unit 100 personnel and the Active
      Duty unit 150 personnel, the total requirement is 290. Critical personnel will be assessed
      using the same guidelines based on specific AFSC/MOS requirements listed in the
      UMD or UTCs required to support.
      3.1.3.5. AFRC and NGB personnel attached to an active duty unit, for training purposes,
      will not be included in personnel numbers.
      3.1.3.6. If a unit is assigned a fragmented portion of a UTC (split-tasking), report the
      UTC portion that has been assigned on the unit DOC Statement. Split-tasking will be
      reflected by using a minus sign (-) immediately after the UTC.
      {Example: FFGK5(-)}. The portion of the UTC that is assigned, or is not assigned, is
      then spelled out within the Remarks section of the DOC Statement (See Attachment 2
      for further DOC Statement guidance).
      3.1.3.7. Individual Mobility Augmentees (IMAs) will only be counted when assigned as
      part of a mobilization or Reserve Call-up. Unit’s reporting IMA numbers in their
      personnel area will explain how the IMAs are used under a PRRES label remark.
3.2. Determining Personnel Availability. Unit personnel may be considered available if
they are assigned to the unit and meet one of the following requirements:
   3.2.1. Are present at home station or can be present within the prescribed unit response time.
   3.2.2. Are at a deployed location and can be ready to redeploy within the unit response time.
   3.2.3. Are not restricted from deploying or employing with the unit (this is for units with a
   mobility mission).
   3.2.4. Are counted if their duty status/availability code(s), on a SORTS Personnel
   Availability Roster and the Duty Status Roster, match those from AFI 10-403, and the
   commander determines them available where appropriate. Personnel having a duty
   status/availability code restricting them from deployment (IAW AFI 10-403) may be
   considered available for in-place missions as determined by the commander.
   3.2.5. Use the following SORTS rules to determine personnel availability according to a
   unit’s DOC Statement Mission Title (Section 2).
      3.2.5.1. For in-place generation, alert, OPERATIONS PLAN 8044 REVISION 03, or
      surveillance missions, count personnel available if they can be expected to return to
      their assigned duty location within response time.
      3.2.5.2. For mobility missions, count personnel available if they are expected to be
      ready to deploy from their present location within DOC response time.
      3.2.5.3. For combined in-place generation and mobility missions, allocate personnel to
      each mission and then apply the rules for each type mission.

        3.2.5.4. For security forces combined in-place generation and mobility missions DOC
        Statements, allocate all personnel required for UTC or mobility deployment and apply all
        remaining available personnel towards home station force protection.
     3.2.6. When a unit temporarily transfers (lends) personnel to another unit, the supplying
     measured unit will continue to measure and report the personnel in its SORTS unless
     otherwise directed by the MAJCOM(s) involved. Likewise a unit receiving personnel from
     another unit will not measure or count those personnel unless otherwise directed.
     Temporary assignment of personnel will not justify improved SORTS C-levels. However,
     support from other units may be factored into a commander’s assessment for the Overall
     C-level.
     3.2.7. MAJCOMs should provide additional guidance to assist unit commanders to
     consistently and accurately determine whether members are available and ready to deploy
     within the response time.
     3.2.8. (Added-AFSOC) Personnel are generally not considered available if:
        3.2.8.1. (Added-AFSOC) In a professional military education or other formal training
        program.
        3.2.8.2. (Added-AFSOC) On leave and will not return to duty within the DOC
        Statement response time (e.g. the duty location is overseas, the person is on leave in the
        continental United States (CONUS) and the response time is 24 hours). Note: If the
        DOC Statement response time is for example, 72 hours, the person TDY or on leave in
        CONUS would most likely be able to return to duty and could be considered available.
3.3. Total and Critical Personnel Percentage Calculation. The lower P-level from total or
critical personnel is used to determine the personnel resource area P-level.
     3.3.1. Total Personnel Percentage. Total personnel are calculated using the following rules:
        3.3.1.1. If 10 or more people are calculated, divide total personnel available by the total
        number of personnel authorized, multiply by 100 and round off to a whole number.
        3.3.1.2. If nine or less people are calculated, use Table 3.2 to derive the percentage.
        3.3.1.3. Enter the percent in the PERTP field.
     3.3.2. Critical Personnel Percentage. Units use one of two methods for computing critical
     personnel percentages; the single percentage computation method or the multiple
     percentage computation method. The method used is derived from Table 3.1 for each unit
     type. If the entries in Table 3.1, columns B and/or C are separated by commas only, the
     single percentage computation method is used. If the entries in Table 3.1, columns B and
     C include semicolons, the multiple percentage computation method is used. Calculate critical
     personnel using the following rules:
        3.3.2.1. For support, non-combat air forces (CAF) units, space, and missile units,
        if 10 or more personnel are calculated, divide the number of critical personnel available
        by the number of critical personnel authorized (UMD) or required (UTC). Multiply the
        result by 100 and round off to a whole number.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                            81


      3.3.2.2. Single percentage computation method. Total the number of personnel
      positions from TPAUTH that contain the AFSCs and skill levels identified in Table 3.1
      as critical. This number becomes the denominator in the percentage equation.
      3.3.2.3. Multiple percentage computation method. Compute a separate percentage for
      each packet of critical personnel. See paragraph 3.5 for an explanation of packets.
      Report the lowest percentage of all of the packets in the PERTC data field.
      3.3.2.4. Percentage computations. The following applies regardless of the method used.
          3.3.2.4.1. Availability of personnel is determined using paragraph 3.2.
          3.3.2.4.2. If the number in the denominator of the percentage equation is nine or less
          personnel, use Table 3.2 to derive percentage.
          3.3.2.4.3. If the personnel calculation baseline (denominator in the percentage
          equation) is 10 or more personnel , divide the number of critical personnel available
          by the number of critical personnel authorized (UMD) or required (UTC). Multiply
          the result by 100 and round off to a whole number.
          3.3.2.4.4. Enter the percentage in the PERTC data field.
      3.3.2.5. CAF aviation units will calculate their personnel numbers using the following:
          3.3.2.5.1. See paragraph 3.3.2.3 to calculate CAF multiple percentages.
          3.3.2.5.2. Find the number of personnel available for each crew position (i.e., pilot,
          co-pilot, navigator, etc.). Calculate critical maintenance personnel as you would for
          non-combat aircraft units using paragraph 3.3.2.1 guidance.
          3.3.2.5.3. If 10 or more aircrew are calculated, divide the number aircrew available
          by the number of aircrew required for each crew position. Multiply the result by
          100 and round off to the whole number.
          3.3.2.5.4. If nine or less aircrew are calculated, find the percent using the number
          available by crew position (Reference Table 3.2).
          3.3.2.5.5. Enter the lowest percentage between aircrew personnel positions and the
          Critical Maintenance AFSCs in the PERTC field.
              3.3.2.5.5.1. (Added-AFSOC) AFSOC flying units will calculate critical
              personnel percentages based on lowest available aircrew personnel position,
              critical maintenance personnel or life support personnel.
      3.3.2.6. Non-CAF aircraft units may elect to use CAF criteria for measuring critical
      personnel including when GTACS CAF units report via aircrew duty position method.
3.4. Personnel Reason Codes.
   3.4.1. Select the most specific reason code from Table 3.5, when P-level is less than P-1.
   3.4.2. If the reason code has changed from the last reported, enter the new reason code in the
   PRRES or PRREF data fields.
82                                             AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009


3.5. Critical Personnel Packet Formulation.
     3.5.1. When a unit’s personnel resources are sufficiently diverse, measuring certain critical
     personnel by the single percentage computation method may mask shortages in critical
     AFSCs and skill levels. In these cases, HQ USAF FAMs may arrange critical AFSCs listed
     in Table 3.1, into groups called packets and separate the packets by semicolons (;). Packets
     will be reflected in the unit’s DOC Statement. Alternatively, UTCs may be substituted for
     AFSC packets when they have manpower details assigned. (Examples: 1C37X, 1C35X;
     3C072, 3C052 or UTC-QFEBA; QFEBB;). The critical personnel packets will be reported
     using the multiple percentage computation method.
     3.5.2. When packets are used, units will calculate a separate percentage for each
     designated packet listed in Table 3.1 using the procedures in paragraph 3.3.2. The lowest
     percentage of all packets will be reported in the PERTC field.
     3.5.3. MAJCOM CAF FAMs may designate non-aircrew personnel packet(s) using
     Table 3.1.
3.6. Commander Assessment and Remarks. Commanders should address the following
personnel issues when submitting a unit assessment, if applicable:
     3.6.1. In the event of UMD/UTC mismatches (paragraph 2.11.7.3), personnel
     measurement calculations will be made based on the UMD requirement for the mismatched
     position(s). Commanders with UTC requirements not on the UMD (not authorized) should
     assess the Overall C-level downward to reflect the impact of the ―missing‖ manpower
     authorizations and remarks should illuminate the specific manpower authorization
     mismatches with the UTC tasked to support. See paragraph 2.11.7.4 for remark requirement.
     3.6.2. Resource capabilities provided by overseas host nation or by foreign national contract
     personnel should be considered in the commander’s assessment when relevant.
     3.6.3. When non-aircrew personnel are not included in the personnel measurement, flying
     unit commanders must assess these required capabilities when assigning an Overall C-Level.

                                           Chapter 4

        EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES ON HAND (O/H) MEASURED AREA DATA

4.1. Equipment and Supplies O/H Reporting. Equipment and supplies O/H measurement
is used to indicate the resource status of authorized equipment and supplies required to support
the unit’s wartime mission(s), as identified in the unit SORTS DOC Statement. This
measurement may indicate budget and supply problems when details are known. Resources
measured in this area are reported in the EQSUPPLY set.
     4.1.1. Equipment and supplies O/H reporting is based on a unit’s wartime requirement.
        4.1.1.1. Units with an in-place generation or combined in-place generation and mobility
        mission, use the applicable documents (AS, Air Staff-level functional area guidance,
        UTC LOGDET, etc.) as the base line for equipment and supplies measurement as
        supplemented by Table 4.4 subareas. These subareas will normally reflect those items
        on the applicable documents that are critical to mission accomplishment.
        4.1.1.2. Units with a mobility-only mission, use LOGDET, plus any applicable Air
        Staff-level functional area guidance, as the baseline for equipment and supplies
        measurement as supplemented by Table 4.4 subareas for each UTC it is required to
        support.
        4.1.1.3. Units compute the equipment and supplies S-level, for combat essential and
        support equipment and supplies, based on the availability of wartime required
        equipment and supplies. Equipment and supplies items are considered available if
        they are assigned to the unit and are physically present or can be present within
        prescribed unit response times.
        4.1.1.4. For equipment and supplies deployed in support of Small Scale Contingencies
        (SSC), equipment and supply items may be considered available to units with mobility
        missions if unit personnel can make the equipment and supplies ready to redeploy within
        the DOC response time.
        4.1.1.5. For in-place (generation), in-place and mobility, or mobility-only missions, the
        full wartime requirement of equipment and supplies is determined by the applicable
        authorizing or requirements documents.
     4.1.2. The formula for equipment and supplies computations is the number of equipment and
     supplies available divided by the wartime requirement multiplied by 100.
4.2. Equipment and Supplies Subareas (ESSAs). This measured area allows measurement
of up to nine subareas. Consider the following:
     4.2.1. In-place/Generation or Generation and Mobility Missions. Use the SORTS DOC
     Statement, LOGDET, IRSP, ASs, and Air Staff-level functional area guidance, as necessary,
     to determine equipment types and numbers authorized/required.
        4.2.1.1. For IRSP, count only XD-coded repairable items to avoid tainting results with
        large numbers of expendable items that current assessment tools cannot model their
        mission impact (BEAR base squadrons excluded).
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                            95


       4.2.1.2. MAJCOMs report strategic airlift aircraft spare engines under a fleet status
       report.
   4.2.2. Mobility Missions. Use DOC Statement to determine the types of equipment and
   supplies to measure and use UTC LOGDET and applicable Air Staff-level functional area
   guidance to determine specific equipment and supply items required.
       4.2.2.1. If more than one UTC is measured, add their individual requirements together.
       4.2.2.2. For MRSP, count only XD-coded repairable items to avoid skewing the count
       with large numbers of expendable items whose mission impact cannot be modeled using
       current assessment tools (BEAR base squadrons excluded).
   4.2.3. Item Possession. To determine the number of items a unit will possess within its
   response time, the unit must have actual responsibility for the items according to applicable
   supply regulations. The following items are not considered possessed:
       4.2.3.1. Additional or BAI in excess of the number authorized or required. Include
       backup aircraft if MEASG does not exceed MEARD.
       4.2.3.2. Items in PDM or Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) depot
       modification.
       4.2.3.3. Items temporarily in the hands of another unit due to long term maintenance
       (lasting more than seven days or for crash or battle damage repair) are not considered
       possessed by the receiving unit. If the unit has items on loan from another unit, the
       items from the other unit will not be counted.
       4.2.3.4. Items loaned to another unit to augment their resources will be considered
       possessed by the owning unit. Receiving unit will not use these resources for SORTS
       reporting. Items will not be double-counted. Units receiving equipment on loan should
       consider a commander’s assessment of the Overall C-level based on support.
   4.2.4. MRSP and IRSP:
       4.2.4.1. Include XD-coded repairable items, but not XB/XF-coded expendable items.
       Large numbers of XB may mask problems with higher value XD items (BEAR base
       squadrons excluded). Include only items serviceable/repairable within the response time.
       4.2.4.2. Include the possessed primary operating stock (POS).
       4.2.4.3. Add the items O/H for each measured subarea to obtain a subarea total.
   4.2.5. Electronic Attack (EA) Pods. If Pods are O/H and mission ready, but are less than
   90 percent mission capable, provide a remark on EA Pod status using the ESSA4 label.
4.3. Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) General Policy. BEAR units report
SORT S data against stated SORTS DOC Statement mission. Each unit must determine and
report their status on the basis of critical BEAR equipment and supplies (support) assigned.
Report using only the assets the unit is authorized. Specific equipment allowances are included
in AFI 25-101, Chap 7 ―USAF Bear Base Systems,‖ and in AS 157, 158 and 159.
96                                             AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009


     4.3.1. The following measured units report on the designated BEAR systems:
        4.3.1.1. 49 Material Maintenance Group (MMG) Holloman AFB, NM for assigned
        ACC BEAR assets.
        4.3.1.2. 609 Air Support Squadron (ASUS) Shaw AFB, SC for assigned USCENTAF
        BEAR and Harvest Falcon assets.
        4.3.1.3. 607 ASUS Osan AB, Korea for assigned PACAF Harvest Eagle, T-550, and
        BEAR assets.
        4.3.1.4. 435 Materiel Maintenance Squadron (MMS) Sembach, Germany for assigned
        USAFE BEAR assets.
        4.3.1.5. 60 Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS), Travis AFB, CA and 305 LRS,
        McGuire AFB, NJ for assigned AMC Swift BEAR assets.
     4.3.2. BEAR base equipment is grouped by UTC and is designed to provide a functional
     capability. UTCs also include support MRSPs that are required to make UTC end items
     functional. When determining UTC capability support, MRSPs must be considered along
     with equipment items. Spare MRSPs provide repair parts and are considered separately.
     Spare MRSP will provide for 30 days of operations without re-supply. See Air Force
     Handbook (AFH) 10-222 for breakdown of BEAR Base sets and packages.
4.4. MRSP and IRSP Authorizations. New MRSP/IRSP authorizations loaded into a unit’s
Standard Base Supply System (SBSS) and requisitioned 90 days prior to authorization/activation
date are assessed beginning on the authorization date. New MRSP/IRSP authorizations start at
the same time as the unit’s specific tasking date for its wartime requirement.
     4.4.1. Revised MRSP or IRSP authorizations are provided a minimum of 30 days and a
     maximum of 60 days grace period for reporting S-levels. This includes annual MRSP reviews
     or major RSP reconfiguration changes.
     4.4.2. Report new authorizations starting 30/60 days after they are loaded into the SBSS, or
     as soon as the sorties/aircraft (for ASM or WSMIS-SAM assessed units) or the RSP
     percent filled (where ASM or WSMIS-SAM are not assessed) of revised authorizations
     equal or exceed that of outdated authorizations, whichever occurs first. Continue to report
     the assessment of the outdated authorizations until the conditions are met for the new
     authorizations, but comment on the status of the new authorizations in the remarks, e.g.
     new MRSP authorization loaded (date).
     4.4.3. Assets available in POS to fill MRSP shortages are counted as O/H in MRSP when
     computing fill percentages in SORTS.
        4.4.3.1. The MRSP percent fill is based on total authorized units, excluding
        Expendability, Recoverability, Reparability Code (ERRC) XB and XF items. The MRSP
        fill percent is computed as follows: O/H (XD) MRSP divided by (XD) MRSP
        authorization multiplied by 100 = (XD) MRSP percent fill rate.
        4.4.3.2. Assets due in from maintenance (DIFM) within DOC response time and not
        awaiting parts (AWP) are also counted as O/H. The O/H MRSP quantity is computed as
        follows: serviceable MRSP + applicable POS + Forward Supply Points (FSP) + (DIFM
        AWP) = O/H MRSP.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                          97


   4.4.4. Units with an in-place DOC have specific IRSP guidance. Each unit with an in-place
   DOC is provided a total wartime requirement.
      4.4.4.1. The total wartime requirement is computed as follows: IRSP + POS O&STQ
      (Order And Ship Time Quantities).
      4.4.4.2. The O/H IRSP quantity is computed as follows: serviceable IRSP + serviceable
      POS + O/ H repairable assets O/H repairable assets coded AWP = authorized units,
      excluding ERRC XB and XF items.
      4.4.4.3. The IRSP fill percent is computed as follows: O/H IRSP quantity divided by
      total wartime requirement multiplied by 100.
4.5. Subarea Percentage Calculations.
   4.5.1. Calculate the subarea percentages. If ten or more items are authorized or required
   divide the number of items possessed within the DOC response time by the number of
   items authorized or required. The number of items counted as possessed is not to exceed the
   number of items authorized. Multiply the result by 100 to derive a percentage and round
   off to the nearest whole number. This whole number is the subarea percentage.
   4.5.2. If nine or less items are authorized or required select appropriate percentage from
   Table 4.2, unless Table 4.4 directs otherwise. Note the derived percentages. If a percentage
   has changed since the last report, enter the new percentage under the appropriate subarea
   label from Table 4.4.
4.6. Combat Essential and Support Equipment O/H Percentage Calculations.
   4.6.1. Determine unit combat essential versus support specification using Table 4.1,
   Column A (unit type), Column B (combat essential equipment) and Column C (support
   equipment).
   4.6.2. To calculate the combat essential and support equipment percentage for each area use
   the following rules:
      4.6.2.1. If the entry lists subarea labels, use the lowest percentage found for those
      subareas.
      4.6.2.2. If the entry lists equipment or another document, calculate that percentage with
      the same procedure used for the subarea calculations.
   4.6.3. Note the derived percentage. If the percentage has changed since the last report, enter
   the new percentage in the EQSEE label for combat essential equipment and the EQSSE
   label for support equipment.
   4.6.4. Note the derived combat essential/supporting item counts. For aircraft units, if the
   item counts have changed since the last report, enter them in the following labels:
      4.6.4.1. The number authorized in the label MEARD.
      4.6.4.2. The number assigned in the label MEASG.
      4.6.4.3. The number possessed in the label MEPOS.
      4.6.4.4. If MRSP fill rate was used in spares assessment, enter it in the RSP field and
      enter an X in the Spares Assessment Driver (ARUSD) field.

4.7. Equipment and Supplies O/H S-Level Calculations. To convert area percentages into
an S-level use the following rules:
     4.7.1. Aircraft units:
        4.7.1.1. Convert EQSEE field to an S-level by using Table 4.6.
        4.7.1.2. Convert EQSSE field to an S-level by using Table 4.7.
        4.7.1.3. Select the lower of EQSEE and EQSSE S-levels.
     4.7.2. Non-aircraft units:
        4.7.2.1. Select the lowest percentage value from EQSEE and EQSSE percentages.
        4.7.2.2. Convert percentage into an equipment and supplies O/H S-level using Table 4.3.
     4.7.3. Note the derived equipment and supplies O/H S-level. If the S-level has changed since
     the last report, enter it in the ESRAT label. Use the Measured Resource Subarea Level for
     Equipment/Supplies O/H (ESRAF) for secondary or tertiary missions.
     4.7.4. If Table 4.1 lists nothing to report for the combat essential and support equipment
     O/H percentages, report S-6 in ESRAT and SNM in ESRES.
4.8. Equipment and Supplies O/H Reason Codes. Select the most specific reason code
from Table 4.5 when the equipment and supplies O/H S-level is less than S-1. Note the
selected reason code. If the reason code has changed since the last report, enter the new reason
code in the label ESRES. Use the label ESREF for secondary or tertiary missions.
4.9. Aircraft Sustainability Model (ASM) and Weapon System Management Information
System Sustainability Assessment Module (WSMIS-SAM). When the SORTS DOC
Statement references ASM or WSMIS-SAM units must use Table 4.9 to find the spares
subarea percentage. MAJCOMs may waive this requirement if there is a major problem with the
ASM assessments. When there is a validated problem with ASM, MAJCOMs may direct the use
of WSMIS-SAM as a secondary or tertiary means of providing an assessment of capability
attributed to spare parts. The following rules apply for ASM and WSMIS-SAM:
     4.9.1. No ASM or WSMIS-SAM available. If ASM or WSMIS-SAM is not available,
     and when authorized by MAJCOM, use the RSP (XD2 only) fill rate to report, using
     Table 4.9, rules 1-4. Report percentages in the RSP and ESSA1 fields. Enter an X in the
     ARUSD field.
        4.9.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) HQ AFSOC/A4 provides this authorization.
     4.9.2. For units with strategic airlift aircraft (C-17, C-5, C-141), use percent SORTIES
     achieved over 30 days (reference Table 4.9).
        4.9.2.1. Enter Y in the ARUSD field.
        4.9.2.2. Report spares assessment percentage in ESSA1 field (reference Table 4.9).
        4.9.2.3. Use fill rates to determine MRSP/IRSP and report in the RSP field.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                            99


   4.9.3. All other aircraft units (non-strategic airlift) use the aircraft availability spares
   assessment method (reference Table 4.9).
       4.9.3.1. Enter Z in the ARUSD field.
       4.9.3.2. Report spares assessment percentage in ESSA1 field (reference Table 4.9).
       4.9.3.3. Use fill rates to determine MRSP/IRSP and report in the RSP field.
   4.9.4. Guidance for specific aircraft availability (ACFTA) options to be used for each
   aircraft type is included in the notes to Table 4.9. Units will contact their MAJCOM office
   with any questions as to which ACFTA Option is appropriate.
   4.9.5. MAJCOMs will promptly notify HQ AFMC Logistics (HQ AFMC/LGXX) of
   specific modeling disconnects with ASM. Notifications should be made within 48 hours of
   discovery, but not later than 72 hours.
   4.9.6. When ASM is used spare engine assessments will be made using Table 4.8 reporting
   the percentage in the ESSA2 field. The ASM assessment does not include spare engines.
   4.9.7. (Added-AFSOC) Use ASM Aircraft Availability Method "Z" Option 1 or 2. Each
   MRSP is considered separately based upon the primary aircraft it is intended to support.
   MRSP with six or less primary aircraft will use Option 2. MRSP with more than six primary
   aircraft will use Option 1. Do not use the unit’s total primary aircraft authorized for Option 1
   or 2 determinations.
       4.9.7.1. (Added-AFSOC) Units with multiple MRSPs will assess each MRSP and use
       their lowest MRSP assessment capability as the driving force. Use Table 4.9 to
       determine this capability.
       4.9.7.2. (Added-AFSOC) The calculated percentage will be in the ACFTA field. The
       ―reported spares assessment percentage‖ will be in the ESSA1 field in accordance with
       Table 4.9.       The EQSSE remark will be formatted in accordance with
       paragraph 2.11.8.8.1.
   4.9.8. (Added-AFSOC) Spare engine authorizations/requirements should be based solely
   on War Reserve Equipment (WRE). Peacetime Operating Stock (POS) engines may be
   considered available; however, not required for SORTS reporting.
4.10. Non-Returnable Deployed Resources. Occasionally, a unit may own equipment that is
required to be left in the contingency AOR after unit personnel redeploy to their home station.
Equipment defined as non-deployable/non-returnable because of use in a particular AOR will
be immediately reported as non-available in the units SORTS report. Unit S-level will reflect
the computations derived from lack of specified equipment.
   4.10.1. MRSPs. MRSPs having SBSS MRSP details that are partially or totally transferred to
   either a MAJCOM Regional Supply Squadron (RSS) or to the deployed SBSS account are
   still the responsibility of the owning base for SORTS reporting.
   4.10.2. The owning LRS will contact the RSS or deployed account to obtain an R26 for
   the transferred items and calculate these assets as available, if they can be redeployed within
   the response time.

   4.10.3. ASM will be used in conjunction with R26 merge program to assess the
   deployed unit’s MRSP (or mission support kit, MRSK, if partially deployed) along with the
   MRSPs at the home base for SORTS.
4.11. BEAR Base Equipment and Supplies O/H Measured Area. Required equipment and
supplies S-levels are based on critical equipment and MRSP authorized for items identified
in the BEAR Base SORTS Critical Item List, as applicable. Authorized suitable substitutes
may be used. The BEAR Base Critical Item List is produced by HQ Air Combat Command
(ACC) Logistics and should be used to calculate these levels.
4.12. Aircraft Engine Computations. These procedures are outlined in AFI 21-104,
―Selective Management of Selected Gas Turbine Engines‖ and must be used to determine
required war readiness engines. Authorized additives, justified on the basis of wartime
requirement, must be included in computations. All aircraft with engine holes will have
serviceable engines allocated. The number of net serviceable spare engines will then be
compared to the WRE requirement and the reported percentage is the factor to be entered on the
S-level checklist. Engines installed in or obligated to BAI, cannibalized (CANN), and
unserviceable assigned aircraft, that are available within response time, may be considered by
the unit commander to subjectively upgrade the S-level. This can include engines projected
available through the pipeline, jet engine intermediate maintenance, or logistics support center
provided that serviceability and Ready For Issue (RFI) requirements are met.

NOTE: If 11 or more engines are required, compute and report the actual percentage available.
This table is used in conjunction with Table 4.7. Units reporting at squadron level, use the
number of engines required for the squadron. Units reporting at wing level, use the number of
engines required for the wing. These procedures are outlined in AFI 21-104 and must be
used to determine required war readiness engines. Authorized additives, justified on the
basis of wartime requirement, must be included in computations. All aircraft with engine holes
will have serviceable engines allocated. The number of net serviceable spare engines will then
be compared to the WRE requirement and the reported percentage is the factor to be entered
on the Aircraft and Equipment and Supplies O/H S-level checklist. Engines installed in or
obligated to BAI, CANN, and unserviceable assigned aircraft, that are available within the
response time, may be considered by the unit commander to subjectively upgrade the
S-level. This can include engines projected available through the pipeline, jet engine
intermediate maintenance, or a logistic support center provided that serviceability and RFI
requirements are met.

                   EQUIPMENT CONDITION MEASURED AREA DATA

5.1. Equipment Condition Reporting. The equipment condition measured area is used to
measure the combat essential and support equipment that can be made ready within the unit’s
response time to undertake the unit’s assigned wartime mission. This measure is also used to
indicate maintenance and equipment reliability, serviceability and operational status of assets.
Units compute the equipment condition R-level for combat essential and support equipment
based on the availability of wartime required equipment. Equipment items are considered
available if they are possessed by the unit and are, or can be, made mission ready within the
prescribed unit response time. The formula for equipment condition computation is: the number
of equipment items mission ready and available divided by the number possessed (not to
exceed the wartime requirement number) multiplied by 100.
5.2. Equipment Condition Subareas (ERSAs). The equipment condition measured area
allows units to measure up to nine subareas. Consider the following for all missions:
   5.2.1. Use SORTS DOC Statements, equipment lists, Air Staff-level functional area
   guidance, LOGDET, AS’s, etc., as necessary, to determine equipment types; then measure
   the number possessed.
   5.2.2. Add number of items possessed for each subarea to obtain a subarea total.
5.3. Subarea Percentage Calculations. Determine the number of items mission ready and
available for each subarea. Accomplish the following:
      5.3.1. Add number of items MRA for each subarea to obtain a subarea total.
   5.3.2. Forecast the number of items that could be MRA by response time.
   5.3.3. Calculate the subarea percentages:
         5.3.3.1. If there are ten or more items possessed accomplish the following:
             5.3.3.1.1. Divide the number of items MRA by the number of items possessed.
             5.3.3.1.2. The number of items counted as possessed is not to exceed the number
             of items authorized.
             5.3.3.1.3. Multiply the result by 100 to derive a percentage.
             5.3.3.1.4. Round percentage to nearest whole number (this is the subarea
             percentage.).
         5.3.3.2. If there are nine or less items possessed select the appropriate percentage from
         Table 5.2, unless Table 5.4 contains other instructions. Note the derived percentages.
         If a percentage has changed since the last report, enter the new percentage in the
         appropriate subarea label from Table 5.4.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                            161


5.4. Combat Essential and Support Equipment Condition Percentage Calculations:
   5.4.1. Find the unit type in Table 5.1, Column A. Use Column B for combat essential
   equipment and Column C for support equipment.
   5.4.2. To calculate the combat essential and support equipment condition percentage for
   each area accomplish the following:
      5.4.2.1. If the entry lists subarea labels, select the lowest percentage for those subareas.
      5.4.2.2. If the entry lists equipment or another document, calculate the percentage with
      the same procedure used for subarea calculations.
   5.4.3. Note the derived percentage. If the percentage has changed, enter the new
   percentage in the EQREE label for combat essential equipment or EQRED label for support
   equipment.
   5.4.4. Note the derived number of combat essential items. For aircraft units, determine the
   number of aircraft that are mission ready and available.
      5.4.4.1. If the number of aircraft that are mission ready and available has changed since
      the last report enter the new number in the label MEMRA.
      5.4.4.2. The number of aircraft reported in the labels MEASG, MEPOS, and MEMRA
      fields will not be greater than the number reported in the label MEARD.
      5.4.4.3. The actual number of aircraft authorized, possessed, and mission-ready and
      available is reported in the MEQLOCN set.
5.5. Equipment Condition R-Level Calculations.
   5.5.1. To convert area percentages into an R-level use the following rules:
      5.5.1.1. Select the lowest percentage value from the combat essential and support
      equipment condition area percentages.
      5.5.1.2. Aircraft units use Table 5.3 to convert the combat essential equipment condition
      percentage into an R-level.
      5.5.1.3. Non-aircraft units use Table 5.6 to convert the equipment condition area
      percentage into an R-level.
   5.5.2. Note the derived equipment condition R-level. If the R-level has changed since the
   last report, enter the new R-level in the ERRAT label (Equipment Condition Measured
   Resource Area Category Subarea (ERRAF) label for secondary or tertiary missions).
   5.5.3. When an AF directed resource change depletes mission ready and available
   equipment, reference paragraph 1.10.9.
   5.5.4. If Table 5.1 lists nothing to report for the combat essential equipment condition and
   support equipment condition percentages, report R-6 in ERRAT and RNM in ERRES
   (see paragraph 4.7.4).
162                                            AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009


5.6. Equipment Condition Reason Codes.
   5.6.1. Select the most specific reason code from Table 5.5, when the equipment condition
   R-level is less than R-1.
   5.6.2. Note the selected reason code. If the reason code has changed since the last report,
   enter the new reason code in the ERRES or ERREF label.
5.7. Equipment Considered Mission Ready and Available (MRA). Most equipment is
considered mission ready if the equipment is safe to use and in the condition to perform the
functions for which it was designed.
   5.7.1. Aircraft, missiles, and major weapons systems must comply with the following:
       5.7.1.1. Have a full or basic system list of items for the stated working mission
       (MAJCOMs are the authority on which system to use).
       5.7.1.2. Be configured with suspension equipment (i.e., dash 21 items and alternate
       mission equipment) that is required by the MAJCOM.
       5.7.1.3. Have all peacetime inspections or time compliance technical order actions
       completed or waived for wartime use.
   5.7.2. In-Place Generation, Alert, or Surveillance Missions. Consider items available if the
   items will be ready at their duty location within response time.
       5.7.2.1. Consider strategic air defense aircraft available when these aircraft are within
       the United States or Canada.
       5.7.2.2. Consider strategic airlift aircraft on operational missions available regardless
       of their location.
       5.7.2.3. Consider strategic tankers on operational missions available if the aircraft will be
       ready to deploy within the response time.
   5.7.3. Mobility Missions. Consider items available, regardless of location, if the items are
   expected to be ready within response time. Equipment items left in a contingency AOR,
   while personnel reconstitute or redeploy, will be reported as non-available if equipment
   condition cannot be ascertained.
   5.7.4. Combined In-place Generation and Mobility Mission. Allocate equipment to each
   mission type and apply the guidelines for each specific mission type.
   5.7.5. Operations Plan 8044 Revision 03 Mission. Consider items available if the items are
   expected to be ready within response time.
   5.7.6. Equipment items loaned to another unit to augment their resources. Will be
   considered possessed by the owning unit. Items will not be double counted. Receiving
   unit will not use these resources for SORTS reporting.
5.8. BEAR Base Equipment Condition Measured Area. Equipment condition R-levels are
based on fully mission capable critical equipment authorized for items identified in the BEAR
Base Critical Item List produced by HQ Air Combat Command (ACC) Logistics. Use the
standard command checklists to calculate this area.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                     163

NOTES:
  1. Rule 43 To be mission ready, a communications central must have the capability to transmit and receive secure
     communications on HF/ Single Side Band (SSB), UHF/AM HAVE QUICK, and VHF/frequency modulation (FM) high-
     power pallet mounted radios and be mounted in a mission ready and available tactical vehicle.
  2. Rule 43 A TAC kit is MRA when the following items are MRA: TACP Close Air Support System, laser range finder, thermal
     imager/laser spot viewer, and GPS receiver.
  3. To compute percentage divide the quantity MRA by the quantity authorized and multiply the result by 100. This must be
     done for each UTC, use the lowest percentage to determine the support equipment condition.
  4. Rule 32a Aircraft assigned and directly support aircraft operations; excludes nuclear support equipment.
  5. Rule 32b Munitions service-level and theater swing-stock support activity (non-aircraft; even if stocks support aircraft;

 NOTES:
   1. SHF SATCOM requires capability to receive incoming data, multiplex,
      modulate, up-link, down-link, demodulate, demultiplex, and transmit outgoing data
      using GMF SHF SATCOM.
      2. TROPO requires capability to receive incoming data, multiplex, modulate, transmit,
         receive, demodulate, demultiplex, and transmit outgoing data using TRC-170.
      3. Operating TSSR pair requires a transmit and receive capability at both ends of TSSR
         link.
      4.    Tactical radio nets must have the capability to transmit and receive secure
           communications using high powered radios.
      5. Each SHF SATCOM and TROPO must be capable of one message circuit (AUTODIN
         or equivalent) and one Transmission Control Protocol/Information Processing Code
         (TCP/IPC) circuit.

 NOTES:
   1. Where different, values for US Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) CRCs are enclosed in parentheses.
   2. Compute maximum number of customers that could be supported by assigned telephone switch(es); considering available
      instruments, cable, j-boxes, termination units, switch capacity, central processing unit (CPU) function, and any other factor
      impacting service availability.
   3. Consider ability to terminate one AUTODIN circuit (UGC-144, etc.)
   4. C2 channels require transmit and receive capability over radios in 4 OMs and external radios.
   5. SHF SATCOM requires capability to receive incoming data, multiplex, modulate, up-link, down-link, demodulate,
      demultiplex, and transmit outgoing data using TSC-100A GMF SHF SATCOM hub. Numbers of carriers are TSC-100A
      available.
   6. SHF SATCOM requires capability to receive incoming data, multiplex, modulate, up-link, down-link, demodulate,
      demultiplex, and transmit outgoing data using TSC-94A GMF SHF SATCOM.
   7. TROPO requires capability to receive incoming data, multiplex, modulate, transmit, receive, demodulate, demultiplex, and

      transmit outgoing data using TRC-170.
  8. Operating TSSR pair requires a transmit and receive capability at both ends of TSSR link.
  9. Net control requires capability to automatically configure, monitor, test, and control circuits and trunks transitioning the
      facility using TSQ-111 or TSQ-188.
  10. To compute multiplexing package capability divide available capability of assigned multiplexers (TSQ-146, FCC-100, RMC,
      etc.) by designed capability and multiply by 100.
  11. Compute ERSA4 percentage by selecting lowest score of all areas measured herein. Where a rating crosses two scores,
      assume higher score unless driven lower by another rating (e.g. 1 TSC-100A Carrier). Where no criteria exists for an area,
      failure to meet minimum criteria will drive score no lower than minimum criteria noted (e.g. no message traffic capability =
      70                                                                                                                 percent).

                           TRAINING MEASURED AREA DATA

6.1. Training. Training measurement is used to indicate the status of training needed to support
the mission for which a unit is designed, as identified in the unit SORTS DOC Statement.
Measured units will calculate a training measured area T-level using either Training Method B
(Crew Training) or Training Method C, Option 1 (Unit Training) or Option 2 (CAF Aviation
Unit Training).
   6.1.1. Option 1 is used to provide fidelity, flexibility, and a macro view of the unit’s training.
   6.1.2. Option 2 is used by CAF aviation units, command and control reporting units,
   and those assigned to a wing (89AA UTC - active duty only) with Aircrew Position
   Indicator (API) codes 1 (pilot), 2 (navigator, observer or air battle manager), and A (career
   enlisted advisor (CEA)) plus 6, or B for CEA, (attached flyer at wing level and below) and 8,
   or D for CEA, (attached flyer above wing level) used to achieve WMP-5 sortie rates
   (e.g. Wing Safety, Tactics, STANEVAL, IG, etc.).
       6.1.2.1. Wing crews with RPI 6 and 8 attached to a squadron for training and wartime
       service are normally measured in the organization of assignment when tasked against
       that unit’s requirements. Personnel resources cannot be counted against requirements in
       more than one unit.
       6.1.2.2. Weapons load crews (AFSC 2W1X1) are unique among maintenance
       personnel, in that they perform their duties as formed and certified crews with specialized
       certification requirements for each crew position. T-levels for 2W1X1 personnel,
       assigned to a weapons load crew, may be determined using Training Method B if and
       when it is allowed by current reporting structure and guidance.
   6.1.3. (Added-AFSOC) AFSOC aircraft units are considered Combat Air Force (CAF)
   aviation units and will report using Training Method C, Option 2.
6.2. Using Training Method B: Crew Training.
   6.2.1. Find the number of crews authorized or required.
       6.2.1.1. Aircraft units reporting against           a   mobility,    SIOP,    or     combined
       in-place/generation and mobility mission:
           6.2.1.1.1. Check the MISCAP of the UTC listed in the SORTS DOC Statement for
           crew ratio or use crew ratio listed in AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning
           Factors, Attachment 36-1, separated by aircraft type.
           6.2.1.1.2. For each UTC, multiply the crew ratio by the primary mission aircraft
           inventory (PMAI) authorization on the SORTS DOC Statement to get the number
           of crews required. Add the separate UTC amounts together to get the total number of
           crews required.
       6.2.1.2. Aircraft units reporting against an in-place/generation or alert mission:
           6.2.1.2.1. Check AFI 65-503 to determine the crew ratio associated with the unit’s
           aircraft type.
216                                            AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009


          6.2.1.2.2. Multiply the crew ratio by the PMAI authorization on the SORTS DOC
          Statement to get the number of crews authorized.
      6.2.1.3. The AF Space Training manager in coordination with the AF Space FAM will
      ensure space operations unit crew requirements are set and based on unit DOCs.
      6.2.1.4. Aeromedical evacuation unit crew requirements are determined by adding
      together the number of crew UTCs tasked to the unit.
      6.2.1.5. If the number of crews has changed since the last report, enter the change
      under the TCARQ label.
      6.2.1.6. Weapons load crew requirements are determined by adding the number of
      crews tasked by aviation UTCs or for SIOP generation (if applicable).
   6.2.2. Find the number of crews assigned.
      6.2.2.1. For aircraft units, use AFI 65-503 for crew composition unless modified by
      the MAJCOM because of unique mission requirements.
      6.2.2.2. All other units, use Table 6.1 for crew composition.
      6.2.2.3. Weapons load crew composition is determined IAW AFI 21-101.
      6.2.2.4. To count a crew as assigned, each position must have an assigned crewmember.
      Do not limit this to by-name formed crews such as those required by AFI 65-503. Count
      crewmembers as assigned from when they sign in on a permanent change of station until
      they sign out.
      6.2.2.5. If the number of crews has changed since the last report, enter the change
      under the TCRAS label. Total crews assigned may not exceed total crews authorized or
      required.
          6.2.2.5.1. Count weapons load crew members as assigned once they are designated
          to a position and have entered initial weapons load crew training.
          6.2.2.5.2. Standardized load crews (SLC), assigned to weapons standardization, will
          be apportioned equally to flying squadrons for determining assigned load crews.
   6.2.3. Count the number of crews mission ready and available.
      6.2.3.1. Count a crew mission ready and available (MRA) when all positions are filled
      with MRA crewmembers.
          6.2.3.1.1. If they meet the mission ready criteria in the training directive listed in the
          SORTS DOC Statement.
          6.2.3.1.2. Determine     crewmember       availability   case-by-case     according    to
          paragraph 3.2.
          6.2.3.1.3. Do not count overhead crewmembers (e.g., wing training officers, etc.).
      6.2.3.2. Enter the total of crews MRA under the TCRAV label.
      6.2.3.3. Count weapons load crews as mission ready and available when all positions
      are filled with position-certified weapons loaders IAW AFI 21-101 and the Unit
      Committed Munitions List.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                              217


   6.2.4. Calculate the training percentage.
      6.2.4.1. If ten or more crews are assigned, divide crews MRA by crews assigned.
      Multiply the result by 100 and round off to the nearest whole number.
      6.2.4.2. Table 6.3 will be used to determine the overall T-level.
      6.2.4.3. If nine or less crews are assigned use Table 6.2.
      6.2.4.4. Enter the percentage under the TRUTC label.
6.3. Using Training Method C, Option 1 - Unit Training. Use this training method to report
subareas specified on the SORTS DOC Statement for the unit types in Table 6.4.
   6.3.1. Determine the number of personnel required to have the training specified in each
   subarea. Some units may have more personnel assigned than are authorized by UMD or
   required by UTC. All individuals must be trained, but not all may be measured in the training
   measured area. Using Method C, Option 1, the number you establish as assigned requiring
   training may not exceed UMD-authorized or UTC-required total personnel.
      6.3.1.1. If a single type of training is listed, determine if everyone is required to have it.
          6.3.1.1.1. If everyone is required to have the training, use the number of total
          personnel assigned as the number required to be trained.
          6.3.1.1.2. If everyone is not required to have the training, use the number of total
          personnel assigned that require the training, (e.g. 25K/40K aerial port training).
      6.3.1.2. If there is more than one type of training listed, (e.g. chemical warfare and
      weapons), determine if everyone is required to have the training.
          6.3.1.2.1. If everyone is required to have the training, use the total personnel
          assigned as the number required to be trained. (Consider limitations in
          paragraph 6.3.1).
          6.3.1.2.2. If less than all assigned personnel are required to have each type of
          training, add together the number required for each type of training. This number
          could be more than the number of personnel requiring training.
   6.3.2. Count the personnel who have the training specified in each subarea.
      6.3.2.1. Personnel are counted as trained if they have completed, or are expected to
      complete, the required training within the response time.
      6.3.2.2. If everyone is required to have all training, count only those personnel who
      have all the training.
      6.3.2.3. If personnel are required to have each type of training, count those personnel
      who have received each type of training. In this method, you can count the same
      individual more than once. To determine the T-level, continue with paragraph 6.5.
   6.3.3. Table 6.3 will be used to determine the overall T-level.

6.4. Using Training Method C, Option 2: CAF Aviation Unit Training.
   6.4.1. Calculations by type of training and crew composition will be compared against the
   percentage conversion Table 6.6, Table 6.7, and Table 6.8 to derive the percentages
   reported in the specific TRSAs. The lowest of the resulting TRSAs will drive the T-level
   reported in the TRRAT label in the OVERALL set.
   6.4.2. As a minimum, the following three training events will be measured. All five subareas
   may be used depending on MAJCOM requirements. If TRSA 4 and 5 are used, enter as in
   paragraph 6.5.4.
      6.4.2.1. TRSA1 - Basic Mission Capable (BMC).
      6.4.2.2. TRSA2 - Combat Mission Ready (CMR).
      6.4.2.3. TRSA3 - Special Capability (SPECAP).
   6.4.3. To count a crew as assigned, each position must have an assigned crewmember.
   However, don't limit this to by-name formed crews such as those required by appropriate
   training directives for the weapon system. Count crewmembers as assigned from when they
   sign in on a permanent change of station or become attached on temporary duty until they
   sign out.
   6.4.4. Single Position Crews:
      6.4.4.1. Assess crews for training subareas the unit is required to report.
          6.4.4.1.1. Determine the number of required BMC/Mission Capable (MC)
          designated crewmembers, assigned and attached to the unit, and the minimum
          crew required based on non-CMR flying positions within the wing and its
          subordinate units. If the BMC changes, detail the changes in a TRSA1 remark.
          6.4.4.1.2. Determine the number of required CMR/Mission Ready (MR)
          designated crew members, assigned and attached to the unit, and the minimum
          crew required based on the PMAI specified by the SORTS DOC Statement.
              6.4.4.1.2.1. Multiply the PMAI by the crew ratio.
              6.4.4.1.2.2. Add the Squadron Commander and Director of Operations (DO)
              (ANG/ AFRC only).
              6.4.4.1.2.3. If the CMR changes, detail the changes in a TRSA2 remark.
          6.4.4.1.3. Determine the number of required SPECAP designated crew members,
          assigned and attached to the unit, and the minimum crew required based on all
          positions identified in the SORTS DOC Statement, applicable training directives, and
          ready aircrew program tasking messages that specify special capability-trained
          aircrews. Calculations will be made only on those SPECAP requirements that match
          those listed in Table 2.3. MAJCOMs may add to this table when approved by HQ
          USAF/XOOT. Commanders may assess other SPECAP shortfalls when they affect
          his ability to undertake his DOC mission. If the SPECAP changes, detail the changes
          in a TRSA3 remark.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                        219


   6.4.5. Multi-Position Crews:
      6.4.5.1. Assess crews for training subareas the unit is required to report.
          6.4.5.1.1. Units with multi-position crews will perform calculations similar to single
          position crews except against each crew position individually. This is required before
          TRSA, TRUTC, and T-level percentages can be determined.
          6.4.5.1.2. Determine the number of required BMC designated crewmembers,
          assigned or attached to the unit, in each duty position, based on the non-CMR flying
          positions within the wing and its subordinate units. If the BMC changes, detail the
          changes in a TRSA1 remark.
          6.4.5.1.3. Determine the number of required CMR/MR designated crewmembers,
          assigned and attached to the unit, in each duty position, based on the PMAI
          specified by the SORTS DOC Statement.
              6.4.5.1.3.1. Multiply the PMAI by the crew ratio.
              6.4.5.1.3.2. Add the Squadron Commander and DO (ANG/AFRC only).
              6.4.5.1.3.3. If the CMR changes, detail the changes in a TRSA2 remark.
              6.4.5.1.3.4. For Air Control Squadrons, determine the number of required
              CMR/MR designated crewmembers, assigned and attached to the unit, in each
              position, based on the UTC manpower requirements.
          6.4.5.1.4. Determine the number of required SPECAP designated crewmembers,
          assigned and attached to the unit, in each duty position, based on all positions
          identified in the SORTS DOC Statement, applicable training directives, and tasking
          messages that specify special capability-trained aircrews. Calculations will be
          made only on those SPECAP requirements that match those listed in Table 2.3.
          MAJCOMs may add to this table when approved by HQ USAF/XOOT.
          Commanders may assess other SPECAP shortfalls when they affect his ability to
          undertake his DOC mission. If the SPECAP changes, detail the changes in a
          TRSA3 remark.
6.5. Calculating and Explaining the Training T-Level.
   6.5.1. Training Method C, Option 1: Unit Training, determine T-level using the following:
      6.5.1.1. Calculate the subarea percentage using applicable tables, as required. Otherwise:
          6.5.1.1.1. If ten or more personnel are required to have the training, divide the
          number of trained personnel by the number of assigned personnel required to have
          the training (not to exceed the wartime required number).
          6.5.1.1.2. Multiply the result by 100 to derive a percentage.
          6.5.1.1.3. Round the percent to the nearest whole number.
          6.5.1.1.4. If nine or less personnel are required to have the training, use Table 6.2
          to determine the percentage.
220                                           AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009


      6.5.1.2. Calculate the training percentage. Determine the unit type in Table 6.4 in
      column A. Across from the unit type in column B, determine whether the entry lists
      subarea labels.
          6.5.1.2.1. If the entry lists subarea labels, choose the lowest subarea percentage as
          the area percentage.
          6.5.1.2.2. If the entry lists types of training or another document, calculate an area
          percentage using the same procedure as for a subarea.
          6.5.1.2.3. If changed since the last report, enter the percentage in the TRUTC label.
      6.5.1.3. Use the TRUTC percentage in conjunction with Table 6.3 to determine the
      T-level to be reported in the TRRAT field. Use the Measured Resource Area Level for
      Training (TRRAF) for Secondary or Tertiary Missions.
  6.5.2. Training Method B: Crew Training, determine T-level using the following:
      6.5.2.1. If ten or more assigned, divide the number of crews mission ready and
      available by the number of assigned (not to exceed the wartime required number).
      Multiply the result by 100 and round off to a whole number.
      6.5.2.2. If nine or less assigned, use Table 6.1.
      6.5.2.3. If the percentage of crews changed since the last report, enter the change in the
      TRUTC label.
   6.5.3. Training Method C, Option 2: Single Position Crews, use the following to
   determine the T-level:
      6.5.3.1. Calculate the percentage trained for each subarea required to be reported.
          6.5.3.1.1. For nine or less crews assigned, use Table 6.2 to derive percentage trained.
          6.5.3.1.2. For ten or more crews assigned, divide number trained by number
          assigned.
      6.5.3.2. Apply each resulting percentage against column A of the corresponding
      training table (BMC/Table 6.6, CMR/ Table 6.7, and SPECAP/Table 6.8).
      6.5.3.3. Convert the column A percentage into the column B reported percentage.
      6.5.3.4. Enter percentage in the related TRSA label: BMC in TRSA1; CMR in TRSA2;
      and SPECAP in TRSA3. If TRSA 4 and 5 are used, enter as in paragraph 6.5.1.
      6.5.3.5. Choose the lowest TRSA reported and enter the percentage in the TRUTC label.
      6.5.3.6. Use the TRUTC percentage in conjunction with Table 6.6, Table 6.7, and
      Table 6.8 to determine the T-level to be reported in the TRRAT label. Use TRRAF for
      Secondary or Tertiary Missions.
  6.5.4. For Training Method C, Option 2: Multi-position crews, use the following to
  determine the T-level:
   6.5.4. (AFSOC) Each SPECAP will be calculated separately using Table 6.8. Use the crew
   position with the lowest training percentage calculation to determine the TRSA percentage.
   Report the lowest percentage from each SPECAP in TRSA3. All SPECAP training
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                         221


   percentages will be shown in the TRSA3 remark and if any percentages are less than T-1
   provide an explanation.
      6.5.4.1. Calculate the percentage trained for each subarea required to be reported.
          6.5.4.1.1. For nine or less crews assigned, use Table 6.2 to derive percentage trained.
          6.5.4.1.2. For ten or more crews assigned, divide number trained by number
          assigned.
          6.5.4.1.3. (Added-AFSOC) Use the numbers of personnel trained per position in
          accordance with paragraph 6.4.5.1.1. The lowest crew position will determine each
          TRSA level. The lowest TRSA level will determine the T-Level.
      6.5.4.2. Apply each resulting percentage against column A of the corresponding
      training table (BMC/Table 6.3, CMR/Table 6.4, and SPECAP/Table 6.5).
          6.5.4.2.1. (Added-AFSOC) AFSOC flying units will use column A of the
          corresponding training table (BMC/Table 6.6, CMR/Table 6.7 and
          SPECAP/Table 6.8).
      6.5.4.3. Convert the corresponding percentage in column B.
      6.5.4.4. Enter the percentage in the related TRSA label: BMC in TRSA1; CMR in
      TRSA2; and SPECAP in TRSA3. If TRSA 4 and 5 are used, enter as in 6.5.1.
      6.5.4.5. Choose the lowest TRSA reported and enter the percentage in the TRUTC label.
      6.5.4.6. Use the TRUTC percentage in conjunction with Table 6.6, Table 6.7, and
      Table 6.8 to determine the T-level to be reported in the TRRAT label. Use TRRAF for
      Secondary or Tertiary Missions.
   6.5.5. Regardless of option used, assign training reason codes when the training T-level is
   less than T-1. Select the most specific reason code from Table 6.5 to explain it. If
   changed, enter it in label TRRES. Use TRREF for Secondary or Tertiary Missions.
   6.5.6. For units that conduct required training and must use alternate workaround facilities
   or methods due to environmental restrictions on normal exercise or major training range
   areas, commanders should note this limitation through a TRRAT or TRSA remark and
   indicate an appropriate reason code from Table 6.5.

      3. Rule 15 BMC, CMR and SPECAP subcategories apply only to Rule 15, Combat
          Air Forces.
      4. Rule 19 For those units with a Combat Camera (COMCAM) or Visual
          Information (VI) mobility mission, members must complete the COMCAM
          Contingency Support course at least once. Such training is considered valid as
          long as the member is assigned to subsequent COMCAM or VI units.
          Assignment outside such a mobility environment not including extended TDYs,
          short tours or specialized training under one year nullifies currency of this
          training, requiring the member to re-accomplish. COMCAM and/or VI unit
          commanders may, at their discretion, choose to send members to the training
          beyond the minimum requirement as readiness dictates. Air Force Aircrew
          Survival Training (for appropriately qualified aircrew personnel) may
          substitute for the COMCAM Contingency Support course, consistent with the
          rules described above.
      5. Rule 12 Training must include a command approved ABDR; engineer, general
          assessor, technical course, and support at least one CLSS field exercise
          (Hardstand) as an engineer.
      6. Rule 43 TACS will be considered current if they meet all air-strike control
          currency requirements to include Night, Live, Laser, and basic TAC requisites
          (IAW AFI 13-112, Vol 1).
      7. Rule 43 Units will include TRUTC remark to report the total number of
          combat mission ready JTACS broken out by officer and enlisted numbers.
      8. Rule 32a Aircraft assigned and directly support aircraft operations; excludes
          nuclear support equipment.

support of a CJCS or combatant command-directed OPLAN, CONPLAN, SIOP, Service
war planning document or assigned in the ―Forces For Unified Commands‖ document are
designated as measured units (units that report SORTS).
Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP)—A short paragraph associated with each UTC that
describes significant employment information. The MISCAP briefly explains mission
capability, and states the types of bases to which a unit can be deployed (i.e., BEAR base,
standby deployment base, or limited operating base).
Mission Qualification Training (MQT)—Training required to achieve a basic level of
competence in a unit’s primary tasked mission; a prerequisite for CMR and BMC status.
Mission Ready and Available (MRA) Aircraft—MRA aircraft have operational full system
list (FSL) or basic system list (BSL) items for the stated mission and are available within the
response time. The aircraft are configured with required suspension equipment, weapons
are uploaded, servicing is completed, and pre-flights are done. The major command
determines which list will be used, which items are required, and the aircraft configuration.
Mission Ready and Available Crews—Primary duty crews who are mission ready and
available to undertake the unit's specified wartime tasking. The measured unit
commander determines crew availability.
Mission Ready and Available Equipment—Equipment that is available and in condition to
perform the functions for which designed within the response time.
Mission Set—Any grouping of missions (EXAMPLE: All missions for which an
organization is organized or designed; chemical biological defense; conventional, nuclear;
engagement, peace-keeping/ peace-making; etc.).
Mobility Mission—A wartime mission for which the measured unit will normally mobilize and
deploy to another area of operation prior to employment.
Mobility Readiness Spares Package (MRSP)—An air transportable package of war reserve
materiel spares, repair parts, and related maintenance supplies required to support planned
wartime or contingency operations of a weapon or support system for a specified period of time
pending re-supply. MRSP may support aircraft, vehicles, communications systems, and other
systems as appropriate.
Notional Tasking—The condition of being prepared to execute a mission set against a
planned requirement that is in fact not tasked, but representative of a probable task in
contingency or deliberate planning actions. Units sourced to the Air Force War and
Mobilization Plan against apportioned requirements that are not currently tasked to any
OPLAN, CONPLAN, or OPERATIONS PLAN 8044 REVISION 03 are notionally tasked to
be able to deliver their Designed Operational Capability within their response time if allocated
to a crisis or sourced to a TPFDD.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                           277


Operational Control (OPCON)—Transferable command authority that may be
exercised by commanders at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command.
Operational control is inherent in Combatant Command (command authority) and is the
authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate forces involving
organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and
giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission.
Operating Location (OL)—Part of a unit that is geographically separated from its parent unit.
It is used to account for personnel by location. Personnel remain assigned to the parent unit
so the command supervision or other features provided by a detachment are not needed.
An OL has none of the administrative attributes of a unit.
Operation Plan—A plan for a single or series of connected operations to be carried out
simultaneously or in succession. It is usually based upon stated assumptions and is in the form
of directive employed by higher authority to permit subordinate commanders to prepare
supporting plans and orders. The designation ―plan‖ is usually used instead of ―order‖ in
preparing for operations well in advance. An operation plan may be put into effect at a
prescribed time, or on signal, and then becomes and operation order (CJCSM 3150.02, Global
Status of Resources and Training System (GSORTS)). Any plan, except for the Single
Integrated Operational Plan (OPERATIONS PLAN 8044 REVISION 03), for the conduct of
military operations. Plans are prepared by Combatant Commanders in response to
requirements established by the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff and by commanders of
subordinate commands in response to requirements tasked by the establishing unified
commander. Operation plans (OPLANs) are prepared in either complete format of an OPLAN,
or as a concept plan (CONPLAN).
OPLAN is an operation plan for the conduct of joint operations that can be used as a basis for
developing an OPORD. An OPLAN identifies the forces and supplies required to
execute the combatant commander’s Strategic Concept and a movement schedule of these
resources to the theater of operations. The forces and supplies are identified in time-phased force
and deployment data (TPFDD) files. OPLANs will include all phases of the tasked operation.
The plan is prepared with the appropriate annexes, appendixes, and TPFDD files as
described in the JOPES manuals containing planning policies, procedures, and formats.
CONPLAN is an operation plan in an abbreviated format that would require considerable
expansion or alteration to convert it into an OPLAN or OPORD. A CONPLAN contains the
combatant commander’s strategic concept and those annexes and appendixes deemed necessary
by the combatant commander to complete planning. Generally, detailed support requirements
are not calculated and TPFDD files are not prepared. Operational control includes authoritative
direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training necessary to accomplish
missions assigned to the command. Operational control should be exercised through the
commanders of subordinate organizations; normally this authority is exercised through the
Service component commanders. Operational control normally provides full authority to
organize commands and forces and to employ those forces as the commander in operational
control considers necessary to accomplish assigned missions. Operational control does not,
in and of itself, include authoritative direction for logistics or matters of administration,
discipline, internal organization, or unit training.
Organic Equipment—Equipment authorized, required, and under the direct control of the unit.

Overhead Crew—A person or a group of people assigned or attached to the organization in a
status other than that of primary duty crew (e.g., wing training officers, safety officers,
maintenance officers, etc.) who maintain mission ready status. Overhead crewmembers WILL
NOT be counted in the personnel or training C-level calculations. They may be assessed
subjectively in the unit’s.
Overall C-level—Commanders of measured units and operations officers who maintain
mission ready status may be counted in the personnel and training C-level calculations.
Pacing Item—An individual line item whose shortage more closely reflects support capability
rather than overall fill rates.
Possessed Aircraft—Aircraft for which actual responsibility has been given to a measured
unit for operational use. Aircraft temporarily absent but remaining under the operational control
(OPCON) of the measured unit are considered possessed aircraft. This includes aircraft
possessed by a unit’s supporting maintenance facilities until the aircraft are lost from the
unit according to AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status and Utilization Reporting.
Possessed Equipment—Equipment for which the measured unit has been given actual
responsibility according to applicable supply regulations for operational use.
Primary Air Force Specialty Code—The awarded AFSC in which an airman is most highly
qualified to perform duty.
Primary Aircraft Authorization Aircraft—authorized to a unit for performance of its
operational mission. The primary authorization forms the basis for the allocation of operating
resources to include manpower, support equipment, and flying hour funds (CJCSM 3150.02,
Global Status of Resources and Training System (GSORTS)).
Primary Duty Crewmember—A person assigned or attached to a measured unit for the
explicit purposes of operating that unit’s primary mission weapon system.
Primary Mission—The wartime mission that is most resource demanding. The only exception
is when a unit has a less resource demanding mission of higher priority
(e.g., OPERATIONS PLAN 8044 REVISION 03).
Registered Units—Units that have the potential to support, by deployment or otherwise, a
CJCS or combatant command-directed operations plan, contingency plan, Single Integrated
Operations Plan , or contingency operation. These units (which do not report SORTS) are
registered in GSORTS through the BIDE and ORGLOCN sets.
Reporting Units—All combat, combat support, and combat service support units, including
Active, National Guard or Reserve units sourced to an operations plan (OPLAN), contingency
plan (CONPLAN), the Single Integrated Operations Plan (OPERATIONS PLAN 8044
REVISION 03), or a Service war planning document, are designated as measured (reporting)
units and are required to report SORTS.
RICDA—The ―as of date‖ of the unit GSORTS report.
Secondary Mission—Wartime mission that is less resource demanding than the primary
mission and is not a subordinate mission to the primary.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                       279


OPERATIONS PLAN 8044 REVISION 03 Mission—Wartime mission for which the

of the Single Integrated Operational Plan. Can include both aircraft sortie generation and
deployable support/recovery teams.
SORTSREPAF—A unit GSORTS report submitted by Air Force units.
Special Mission Capability—An enhancement to mission accomplishment. It provides
opportunities for accomplishment in various situational scenarios, adds tactical flexibility to
mission accomplishment, and normally requires additional training and or specialized
equipment.
Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS)—A JCS controlled, automated data
system primarily created to provide to NCA and JCS with authoritative identification,
location, and resource information. It is used throughout the chain of command to measure the
daily resource status of operating forces.
Subarea—A class of equipment or supply within a SORTS major category of equipment.
The major categories are combat essential equipment and support equipment and supplies.
Subordinate Mission—Those missions, which stand by themselves as directed sub-elements
within the primary mission. Subordinate missions are not secondary missions but integral
elements of the primary mission.
Subordinate Reporting Organization (SRO)—The wing or base-level agency that is
designated to enter data into SORTS for the combat, combat support, and combat services
support units at that location. Often it is the reports cell of the unit command post.
Supplies—In logistics, all material and items used in the equipment, support and maintenance of
military forces (CJCSM 3150.02, Global Status of Resources and Training System (GSORTS)).
Support Equipment—All equipment required to perform the support function except that
which is an integral part of the mission equipment. Does not include any equipment required
to perform mission operation functions (AFDD 1.2, Air Force Glossary).
Suspension Equipment—All aircraft devices such as racks, adapters, missile launchers, and
pylons used for carriage, employment and jettison of aircraft stores. (CJCSM 3150.02, Global
Status of Resources and Training System (GSORTS)).
Tarble of Allowance (TA)—An equipment allowance document which prescribes basic
allowances of organizational equipment, and provides the control to develop, revise, or change
equipment authorization inventory data (CJCSM 3150.02,Global Status of Resources and
Training System (GSORTS)).
Tasked—Assignment to perform a specific mission or task allotted by higher component.
Total Personnel—The total number of personnel authorized or required by the measured unit.
Unit Descriptor Code (UDC)—A one character, alphanumeric code indicating the component,
general status, and primary mission for which the organization was established. Stored in
the Joint SORTS database as a 3 character code.
280                                           AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009


Unit Identification Code (UIC)—A six-character, alpha-numeric code that uniquely
identifies each Active, Reserve, and National Guard unit of the Armed Forces (CJCSM
3150.02,Global Status of Resources and Training System (GSORTS)).
Unit in Cadre Status—A unit is in cadre status when it deploys assets to support a task
force or rotational unit, and the assets of the original unit are depleted to the extent that it
cannot undertake its wartime mission.
Unit Manning Document (UMD)—A detailed manpower listing reflecting the distribution of
manpower allocation into a finite structure of authorizations (by work center) (AFI 38-205,
Manpower and Quality Readiness and Contingency Management).
Unit Type Code (UTC)—A five-character, alpha-numeric code that uniquely identifies each
type of unit in the Armed Forces (CJCSM 3150.02, ) Global Status of Resources and Training
System (GSORTS)).
War and Mobilization Plan (WMP)—The Air Force supporting plan to the Joint Strategic
Capabilities Plan. The six volumes of the WMP extends through the Six Year Defense Program
to provide continuity in short and mid-range war and mobilization planning. It provides
current planning cycle policies and planning factors for the conduct and support of wartime
operations. It establishes requirements for development of mobilization and production-
planning programs to support sustained contingency operations of the programmed forces.
The WMP encompasses all functions necessary to match facilities, manpower, and material with
planned wartime activity (AFDD 1-2, Air Force Glossary).
War Reserve Material (WRM)—Material required, in addition to mobility equipment,
RSP, and primary operating stocks needed to support wartime activities reflected in the US
Air Force War and Mobilization Plan until the industrial base has generated sufficient
deliveries to equal planned wartime consumption (AFDD 1-2, Air Force Glossary).
Wartime Mission—A task or group of tasks assigned to a unit in an approved operations
plan and expected to be executed during some level of armed conflict whether incident,
limited war, or general war.

                                        Attachment 2
 DESIGNED OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY (DOC) STATEMENT (AF FORM 723 OR
               APPROVED FACSIMILE) DEVELOPMENT

A2.1. Designed Operational Capability Statements. A SORTS DOC Statement identifies a
measured unit and references the unit’s wartime mission(s). Its purpose is to provide a summary
of the mission for which a unit is organized or designed (or equipped, when tasked). The
SORTS DOC Statement is a hard copy management tool used to describe a unit’s mission and
provides details for its SORTS measurement criteria. SORTS DOC Statements are not used as a
tasking source. SORTS DOC Statements list resources and training requirements based on
WMP-1, 3, and 5, command instructions, OPLANS, CONPLANS, and other AF or MAJCOM
directives. All reporting units are provided a primary SORTS DOC Statement that is designed to
assist them to report C-level status to satisfy JCS SORTS requirements. Additionally, units may
be provided other subordinate missions on their DOC Statement, by the MAJCOM, to satisfy
unique requirements. See Chapter 1 for policy on writing SORTS DOC Statements.
   A2.1.1. DOC Statements will be developed using an AFF 723 or an approved computer
   generated facsimile.
   A2.1.2. Sections of the SORTS DOC Statement (AF Form 723). A unit SORTS DOC
   Statement is divided into six sections: Unit Identification, Mission Identification,
   Measured Resources Areas (MSRA), Amplifying Notes, Gaining Command list, and
   Coordination/Review.
       A2.1.2.1. Section I, Unit Identification, includes the measured unit ANAME, HOGEO,
       a representative UTC of the unit type named on the DOC, and the six-character UIC.
       This section also includes the DOC Mission Title, DOCID, and Geographic Location
       Code (GEOLOC).
       A2.1.2.2. Section II, Mission Identification, includes a mission tasking narrative and
       mission specifics (i.e., response time and source, aircraft and missile mission-design-
       series (MDS), planning UTCs the unit is required to support for the unit’s
       mission(s), direct support units’ UICs, ANAME, and OPLAN(s) to which the unit is
       sourced to support). For weapon systems with a range of sortie rates and duration listed
       in the WMP-5, specify the single sortie rate and duration highlighted for planning
       purposes as the wartime flying scenario for SORTS in a unit SORTS DOC Statement,
       Section II, Part B.
       A2.1.2.3. Section III, MSRAs, will include the required measured resource areas.
          A2.1.2.3.1. Section IIIA, Personnel. MAJCOM FAMs will determine if the Total
          Personnel MSRA is determined using the UMD or only UTCs IAW paragraph
          3.1. Additionally, they provide packets for packet methodology of measuring
          Critical Personnel (included in Table 3.1). Use of the packet methodology can allow
          shortfalls to be more visible within SORTS.
              A2.1.2.3.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) When Section II Part D of AF Form 723
              identifies a DSU UIC, the FAM will identify the UTC supported by the DSU. If
              the DSU is not providing the entire UTC, then the FAM will identify the specific
              AFSCs being provided by the DSU.
282                                        AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009


         A2.1.2.3.2. Section IIIB, Equipment and Supplies O/H. The Equipment and
         Supplies O/H MSRA section lists the combat essential and/or support equipment and
         supplies that the unit is required to measure in SORTS. MAJCOM FAMs may use a
         packet methodology for measuring equipment and supplies O/H when included as
         subarea measurements (ESSAs) in tables listed in Chapter 4. Use of the packet
         methodology allows shortfalls to be more visible within SORTS. This section also
         includes space for additional remarks.
             A2.1.2.3.2.1. (Added-AFSOC) If two DSUs support a UTC, use the additional
             notes section to identify the DSUs and UTC. Identify the quantity of AFSCs, by
             UTC, each DSU supports. It is acceptable to list the shortest list of AFSCs and
             follow with a note stating the remaining AFSCs are provided by the other DSU.
             Use continuation sheets as required. The additional notes will be formatted in
             accordance with the example below:

             UTC            DSU           AFSC
             XYZA1          1 SOLRS       1S052 (2)
                            1 SOAMXS      All other AFSCs
             XYFF2          1 SOSS

         A2.1.2.3.3. Section IIIC, Equipment Condition. The Equipment Condition MSRA
         section lists the combat and/or support equipment the unit is required to
         measure and report in SORTS. MAJCOM FAMs may use a packet methodology
         to measure equipment condition when included as subarea measurements (ERSAs)
         in Chapter 5 tables. Use of the packet methodology allows shortfalls to be more
         visible within SORTS. This section also includes space for additional remarks.
         A2.1.2.3.4. Section IIID, Training. Air Force units use either Training Method B or
         C. Training Method C is comprised of two options, Option 1 and 2. Option 1 is
         used to report unit training. All Active, Reserve, and National Guard units with a
         CAF mission will use Option 2 to support the Ready Aircrew Program (RAP).
         Method B is used by aviation units outside CAFs. This section also includes space
         for additional remarks.
      A2.1.2.4. Section IV of the SORTS DOC Statement (AFF 723) provides space for
      amplifying notes. Amplifying notes further guide unit SORTS monitors and
      commanders in understanding the scope of the desired SORTS report and additional
      details required accomplishing the report.
      A2.1.2.5. Section V, Gaining Commands. Lists initial AF gaining commands if the unit
      is to be under OPCON of another command after mobilization.
      A2.1.2.6. Section VI, Coordination and Review. Coordination blocks will be used
      for initial SORTS DOC Statement issue to capture interested parties’ concurrence and
      the review blocks for annual review.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                         283


A2.2. Units Required To Have A SORTS DOC Statement (AFF 723 or approved
facsimile). N o t every unit in the Air Force is required to have a SORTS DOC Statement. Units
tasked against an OPLAN, Concept Plans, Operations Plan 8044 Revision 03, or have standard
UTCs coded as simultaneously available for deployment under war time surge conditions
(DWS or DWX), or other tasking documents, are required to have SORTS DOC Statements.
Applicable units will report SORTS regardless of whether currently in plans or available to be
included in these plans. Provisional or task organized units will be provided a SORTS DOC
Statement when they are required to report. Aircraft/Non-Aircraft-Combat units or separately
deployable DETs, Aircraft-Combat Support Elements, Non-aircraft-Combat Support
Elements, and Combat Service Support Elements listed in Table A2.1 must possess a valid
SORTS DOC Statement.
   A2.2.1. Permanently separated DETs planning to be geographically separated from their
   parent unit will act as measured units and report their own C-level data. These units will
   have an independent PAS code. OLs A, B, etc. will be included in the SORTS DOC
   Statement and SORTS report of their parent unit, when appropriate.
   A2.2.2. DOC Statements must be provided to units as soon as possible after the unit is
   activated by the publication of G-series orders. Units must start reporting in conjunction
   with the effective date of the DOC Statement. The DOC Statement remains in force until the
   unit is inactivated by the publication of a G-Series order.
A2.3. Single and Multiple SORTS DOC Statements (AFF 723 or approved
facsimile). M o s t u n i t s will have only one SORTS DOC Statement called the Primary Mission
SORTS DOC Statement. The Primary Mission SORTS DOC Statement encompasses all
missions for which the unit is organized or designed (primary mission). MAJCOMs may elect
to have a unit report on parts of the overall mission set. If the parts of a unit’s total wartime
mission are significantly distinct, the parent MAJCOM may elect to produce multiple SORTS
DOC Statements for that unit. Any major part of the overall mission (mobility, generation,
nuclear, conventional, etc.) will be a secondary mission and be described on a Secondary Mission
SORTS DOC Statement. Any subordinate portion (UTC, section, flight, etc.) will be a tertiary
mission and be described on a Tertiary Mission SORTS DOC Statement. Units should not use
the SORTS mission rank ordering to prioritize training or resource allocation requirements.
Do this only when directed by the MAJCOM through the planning process.
   A2.3.1. Procedures for Secondary or Tertiary Mission SORTS DOC Statement
   development and approval are the same as the unit’s Primary Wartime Mission SORTS DOC
   Statement.
   A2.3.2. Some resource area P, S, R or T-levels may be the same for secondary or tertiary
   missions as for primary mission resource area Levels. SORTS DOC Statements must include
   enough information on how to measure resources that it is clearly understood.
   A2.3.3. Some units have several missions (survive to operate, Operation Security
   (OPSEC)/Communication Security (COMSEC), SABC, etc.) contained within the
   primary mission. The capability exists to measure these as elements of the primary
   mission. These ancillary missions of the primary mission are not secondary or tertiary
   wartime missions. SORTS DOC Statements are not normally required for these ancillary
   missions.
284                                             AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009


A2.4. Source References for SORTS DOC Statement (AFF 723 or approved
facsimile). Thefollowing are examples of references, information, data, and source documents
for SORTS DOC Statements:
      A2.4.1. SORTS Files are record files for units and contain the following information:
         A2.4.1.1. The Unit BIDE. Several fields in the SORTS BIDE set contain information
         which must be used to update the unit SORTS DOC Statement. If the unit data in the
         SORTS BIDE is incorrect, MAJCOM SORTS offices are responsible for immediate
         correction.
         A2.4.1.2. The Unit’s UIC is the six-character code that identifies the unit. It is created
         by adding the letter F to the front and the number zero to the end of the last four
         characters of a unit’s PAS code. Subordinate organizations to the PAS code holding unit
         may be registered in SORTS using the ―parent‖ unit’s PAS. Adding F to the front and a
         unique letter or number at the end (A, B, 1, 2, etc.). Provisional units may be registered
         by replacing the second F with an H and the character following that reflects it
         relationship to the parent.
         A2.4.1.3. The UTC in Section I of the SORTS DOC Statement is the five-character code
         from the unit’s registration BIDE. This UTC is the unit’s Deployment Indicator
         (DEPID) Code 9 non-deployable UTC.
         A2.4.1.4. The Unit ANAME is the standardized unit abbreviation from AFPD 38-5,
         Unit Designations, if available and a unit designation (number).
   A2.4.2. Air Staff and MAJCOM FAM Tasking Documents may be used to obtain specific
   information on tasks and UTC configurations.
   A2.4.3. USAF WMP-3 is divided into three parts and contains information on Combat
   Forces and the AFWUS. WMP-3, Part 1 identifies AF General Purpose Combat Deployable
   Forces, Part 2 identifies Combat Support Deployable Forces (LRS, medical, chaplain,
   comm., etc.), and Part 3 is a list of USAF UTCs approved for use in planning and is the
   catalog of capabilities the AF offers to the supported CCs to build OPLAN taskings. The
   AFWUS is the system of record to record the UTC taskings of wings/units and to provide
   AF planners with a list of USAF UTCs available for tasking. MAJCOMs must
   disseminate this UTC availability information to their wings/units to ensure the units
   know what UTCs they are tasked to support. The AFWUS lists which units will provide
   UTCs, DOC Statements define what UTCs units are designated to support, and the
   MISCAP defines what specific capability the UTCs can provide.
   A2.4.4. USAF WMP-5 describes basic planning factors and data used for aircraft sortie
   and flying hour data.
   A2.4.5. A current manpower detail listing (MP-4 report) from a standard MANFOR retrieval
   may be used to determine current manpower and critical AFSC configurations for tasked
   UTCs.
   A2.4.6. A current Time-Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD) extract can be used to
   list tasks in various plans.
      A2.4.7. Refer to Table A2.2 for AFI references for SORTS DOC Statements.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                     285


   A2.4.8. USAF WMP I, Annex F, lists medical unit response times.
A2.5. SORTS DOC Statement Preparation.
   A2.5.1. HQ USAF SORTS Office will:
      A2.5.1.1. Forward copies of initial SORTS DOC Statements to air staff-level functional
      offices of primary responsibility, as required, for review and coordination.
      A2.5.1.2. Keep a master file of all initial and reviewed SORTS DOC Statements.
      A2.5.1.3. HQ USAF/XOO reserves the right to challenge any SORTS DOC Statement.
   A2.5.2. MAJCOMs, ANG, and FOA/DRU will:
      A2.5.2.1. Develop, coordinate, and approve unit SORTS DOC Statements. All
      MAJCOMs, ANG, and FOA/DRU will develop, coordinate, and approve unit SORTS
      DOC Statements using prepared system software, Microsoft Word Template, JetFlow, or
      MS Access. If an AF Form 723 is not used, coordinate with HQ USAF SORTS and
      ensure alternate methods provide all information on the AFF 723, Sections I through VI.
          A2.5.2.1.1. AFRC and NGB must coordinate proposed SORTS DOC Statements
          with the initial gaining command (e.g., ACC, AMC, PACAF, etc.).
          A2.5.2.1.2. AFRC and ANG will suspense gaining MAJCOM DOs/XOs with a date
          45 days after gaining MAJCOM receipt of the draft SORTS DOC Statement. If no
          response is received by the suspense date, then AFRC or ANG will assume
          MAJCOM concurrence on the SORTS DOC Statement as written.
      A2.5.2.2. Provide HQ USAF SORTS with copies of all DOC Statements. MAJCOMs,
      who provide DOCs via web pages, must send an electronic mail (e-mail) to HQ USAF
      SORTS informing of new or updated DOCs. MAJCOMs that do not provide access to
      DOC Statements via web page must send an e-mail with the current DOC Statements
      attached. DOCs briefed in the Air Staff JQRR will be e-mailed regardless of
      availability.
      A2.5.2.3. The CRO will send the approved DOC Statement to the SRO.
      A2.5.2.4. Submit requests for new DOCIDs, not listed in Table A2.3, to HQ SORTS at
      least 30 calendar days prior to the programmed effective date. This will provide
      adequate time to update computer programs.
      A2.5.2.5. Maintain a copy of all unit SORTS DOC Statements under their command.
   A2.5.3. Measured units and subordinate reporting organizations will:
      A2.5.3.1. Maintain a copy of each unit’s SORTS DOC Statement (AFF 723).
      A2.5.3.2. Make sure the unit commander reviews the SORTS DOC Statement (AFF
      723) as required per paragraph 1.11.11.1.8.
A2.6. SORTS DOC Statement Annual Review. MAJCOM FAMs will review their
respective SORTS DOC Statements on an annual basis and prior to the statement anniversary
date. If there are any changes, FAMs must submit a new SORTS DOC Statement (AFF 723) to
the local SORTS office for processing IAW paragraph A2.5 Each MAJCOM, ANG, FOA and
DRU will ensure HQ SORTS, all interested MAJCOMs, and reporting units receive a SORTS
286                                          AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009


DOC Statement annual review document that lists the unit UIC, ANAME, location, and
DOCID. Discrepancies should be addressed to the SORTS office that initiated the review. All
SORTS DOC Statements, other than initial statements, must have a current review date (less
than one year old). Each MAJCOM, ANG, FOA and DRU SORTS office will be responsible for
tracking annual reviews and notifying FAMs when an annual review is due.
A2.7. SORTS DOC Statement Unit Tasking Changes. As a norm, SORTS DOC Statements
must be revised at least 30 days prior to any significant expected change(s) in unit tasking to
include, but not be limited to, changes in types of major equipment, unit mission, or unit
response time. Unexpected changes that may require DOC revision must be made no later than
60 days after changes are known.
   A2.7.1. MAJCOMs, ANG, FOA, and DRU develop and coordinate changes to unit
   SORTS DOC Statements. All MAJCOMs, ANG, and FOA/DRU will complete an AF
   Form 723. If the AF Form 723 is not used, coordinate with HQ USAF SORTS and provide
   all information from the AFF 723, Sections I through IV. AFRC and NGB must
   coordinate proposed changes to SORTS DOC Statements with initial gaining command
   (e.g., ACC, AMC, PACAF, etc.) IAW A2.5.2.1.2.
   A2.7.2. Submit one copy of each unit’s changed SORTS DOC Statement to HQ USAF
   SORTS as an attachment to e-mail or DMS message. Coordinate with HQ USAF SORTS for
   points of contact and addresses (if e-mail is not possible, coordinate for an alternate
   means to submit a unit’s changed SORTS DOC Statement(s).
   A2.7.3. Accomplish actions listed from paragraph A2.5.2.3 through A2.5.3.2.
A2.8. SORTS DOC Statement (AF Form 723) Instructions. Reference Figure A2.1 through
Figure A2.8 for samples of SORTS DOC Statements. SORTS DOC Statements will
normally be classified according to derivative classification guidance.
   A2.8.1. Part I, Unit Identification.
       A2.8.1.1. Measured Unit. Use the abbreviated name from SORTS BIDE set, ANAME
       field, that is paired to the UIC entry.
       A2.8.1.2. Home Location. Use the home geographic name and country or state code
       from the GEONA (geographic name) and CRTCD (country code) fields in the GEOFILE
       (geographic location file).
       A2.8.1.3. To establish a UTC use one of the following methods: 1) Use the DEPID
       Code 9 UTC from the UTC label in SORTS. This is a non-deployable, in-place UTC,
       assigned by HQ USAF and used by the JCS for categorization of the unit type or 2) use a
       UTC from the tasked set that is most representative of the unit mission.
       A2.8.1.4. UIC. Use the code from SORTS BIDE set, UIC field.
       A2.8.1.5. DOC Mission Title. Select a long mission title from Table A2.3 that best
       describes the unit mission. If no available long mission title adequately describes the
       unit, recommend a new one to HQ USAF SORTS.
       A2.8.1.6. GEOLOC. Use the code from SORTS in the label HOGEO.
       A2.8.1.7. DOCID. Paired with the mission title entry, select the DOCID from
       Table A2.3 that was chosen for the DOC mission title.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                        287


         A2.8.1.7.1. For new titles, use the area letter and XX99 (e.g., SX99) as an interim
         DOCID. Request a new DOCID from HQ USAF SORTS using the format in
         Figure A2.9. Interim DOCIDs are valid for 90 days.
         A2.8.1.7.2. Submit request for changes to DOCIDs not listed in Table A2.3 to HQ
         USAF SORTS at least 30 calendar days prior to the programmed effective date to
         provide adequate time to update computer programs. Tables in this instruction will
         follow with the next update cycle.
     A2.8.1.8. DOCNR. Only the primary mission SORTS DOC Statement will use DOCNR
     1. Major portions of the unit’s mission, listed in secondary mission SORTS DOC
     Statements, will use DOCNR 2 through 9. Subordinate portions of the unit’s mission,
     listed in tertiary mission SORTS DOC Statements will use DOCNR A through J.
     A2.8.1.9. Mission Rank. Select primary, secondary or tertiary via paragraph A2.3.
  A2.8.2. Part II, Mission Identification.
     A2.8.2.1. A. Mission Tasking Narrative. Describe the unit’s wartime mission in plain
     text using missions in AF Doctrine Document (AFDD) 1-1, Air Force Task List. This is
     a summary of the mission capabilities the unit brings to the tasks for which it is
     designed. List major tasks and their purposes (e.g., provide rapid intra-theater mobility
     for all military forces) for each mission (JCS/ AF) and any special mission capabilities
     the unit is organized or designed to provide. Special mission capabilities are included
     when they are essential for mission success.
         A2.8.2.1.1. The most resource demanding OPLAN or set of UTC(s) mission
         capabilities should be referenced if it is used as the basis for unit reporting.
         A2.8.2.1.2. Address secondary missions, tertiary missions, additional, or special
         capabilities separately in the SORTS DOC Statement Section IV.
     A2.8.2.2. B. Mission Specifics.
         A2.8.2.2.1. Response Time. Enter the response time that upon which the C-level
         is based (from OPLAN, WMP-3, UTC, etc.). Enter the shortest time in hours
         (01 - 72 hours) by which all unit resources are to be generated or prepared for
         deployment. Aircraft units response time source is the WMP-3, Part 1 availability
         date.
             A2.8.2.2.1.1. For units with alert, generation, Operations Plan 8044 Revision
             03, or surveillance missions, use the time required to employ all tasked forces.
             For aircraft units, the response time source is WMP-3, Part 1 availability date.
             A2.8.2.2.1.2. Units with a mobility mission will use the time to begin loading of
             common user or organic lift before deployment (i.e., ready-to-load date at origin).
             A2.8.2.2.1.3. Active duty and specifically identified Reserve and Guard SF units
             must be able to deploy within 24 hours after notification per WMP 1, Annex T.
             A2.8.2.2.1.4. Reserve and Guard units not specifically identified must be able to
             deploy within 72 hours of notification.
288                                          AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009


             A2.8.2.2.1.5. Ensure response time for Reserve and Guard units includes
             24 hours for mobilization or call-up plus time allocated for preparation once
             mobilized. SF units will comply with Attachment 2, paragraphs A2.8.2.2.1.3
             and A2.8.2.2.1.4.
             A2.8.2.2.1.6. When response times exceed 72 hours or a source reference does
             not exist, use the default time of 72 hours IAW JCS policy. Do not use this
             default time for other than SORTS reporting.
         A2.8.2.2.2. Source. List the source for the response time. When the source reference
         does not exist, exceeds the default time, or if the default time was used, list
         ―AFI 10-201‖. Indicate the paragraph number of the source used within the provided
         brackets, e.g., [3.2.1.]. When "AFI 10-201" is listed as the source, reference the
         source document and paragraph number for the response time in part IV Amplifying
         Notes.
         A2.8.2.2.3. MDS. Use the WMP-3, Part 1 or USAF Program Document to enter the
         number and type of major equipment and PMAI. Do not include BAI. List the MDS
         for missiles (e.g., ICBMs).
         A2.8.2.2.4. Sorties/Flying Hours (aircraft units only). Use sortie factors in WMP-5
         to enter sortie rates and sortie duration, and rates the unit is required to perform for
         its wartime mission(s).
      A2.8.2.3. UTCs Required to Support. Enter the UTCs for force packages that the unit is
      expected to be able to simultaneously support. These UTCs are the AFWUS UTCs with a
      Nonsourced Unit Type Code (NSUTC) of ―DWS‖, ―DWX‖ (the total number of
      standard UTCs coded as ―DW_‖ (DWS and DWX) represent the maximum number of
      standard UTCs the unit can deploy simultaneously during wartime surge and any UTCs
      associated with the unit's in-place wartime mission(s). All of these UTCs must be
      included in Part II of the DOC Statement and reported in the unit's SORTS C-Level.
         A2.8.2.3.1. For alert, generation, Operations Plan 8044 Revision 03, and
         surveillance missions, use the unit’s in-place UTC (coded as ―non-deployable‖ in
         AFWUS), or other deployable UTCs required for home station support during
         wartime.
         A2.8.2.3.2. For mobility missions, list standard, deployable UTCs (AFWUS NSUTC
         codes of ―DWS‖ and ―DWX‖ as a minimum). Since UTC detail is used for
         measuring/reporting SORTS, ensure UTC detail is complete.
         A2.8.2.3.3. Use a combination of both deployable and in-place generation UTCs
         for combined in-place generation and mobility missions. Functional managers are
         responsible for de-conflicting the UTCs and providing guidance on which UTCs a
         unit can be expected to simultaneously support. Use remarks sections to illuminate
         how each tasking should be considered in light of others that may conflict
         (i.e., assumptions in planning may exclude one or the other tasking like Operations
         Plan 8044 Revision 03 and conventional mobility).
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                         289


            A2.8.2.3.3.1. Units may be resourced to be able to provide combinations of
            UTCs that would in aggregate exceed their total assets, (i.e. parent-child UTCs)
            but they must not be postured/tasked in the AFWUS or plans beyond their
            authorized resource levels. UTC combinations that cannot be de-conflicted
            (i.e. Operations Plan 8044 Revision 03/mobility) should be delineated on the AF
            Form 723, Section IV, Amplifying Notes. The assumptions on which a dual
            tasking lies must be provided or referenced.
            A2.8.2.3.3.2. If a unit shares a UTC tasking with another unit (split tasking),
            or is not required to support the entire UTC, place a hyphen (-) after the
            applicable UTC, and note the details in Part IIIA, Additional Notes. All units
            supporting the tasking will list the UTC in their SORTS DOC Statement. Each
            SORTS DOC Statement will list all of the units supporting the split UTC tasking.
            A2.8.2.3.3.3. Commander assessments will be based on providing either/or
            combinations of resources, not all simultaneously in these cases. When the unit
            commander must assess specific resource combinations, they should be listed. All
            instances of Parent-Child UTCs must first be approved by the USAF War and
            Mobilization Plans Division (AF/XOXW).
     A2.8.2.4. Direct Support Units UICs. Enter direct support unit UICs and ANAMEs.
     A2.8.2.5. OPLANs (Optional). List those OPLANs and other documents that the unit is
     tasked to support. Identify plans by command and number (e.g., United States
     Commander European Command (USCOMEUR) OPLAN 4102). This will classify
     the SORTS DOC Statement IAW the OPLAN classification guidance. If no specific
     OPLAN is identified, enter Command Directed.
     A2.8.2.6. (Added-AFSOC) The FAM will ensure all UTCs coded ―DW -‖ are included
     in Part II of the AF Form 723 validation of all new or revised DOC Statements. HQ
     AFSOC/A1RR will validate the FAM has identified all ―DW -‖ coded UTCs on the DOC
     Statement.
     A2.8.2.7. (Added-AFSOC) AFSOC DOC Statements will list the OPLANS and other
     planning documents the unit is tasked to support.
  A2.8.3. Part III, Measured Resource Area.
     A2.8.3.1. Personnel Measured Area. Check the applicable box(s).
         A2.8.3.1.1. Total. Place an X in this box to indicate total personnel is to be reported,
         regardless of UMD or UTC, along with critical personnel listed in Table 3.1 and
         emergency essential and Key DOD civilians.
         A2.8.3.1.2. UMD and UTC. FAMs with alert, generation, combined in-place
         generation and mobility, or surveillance units will place an X in the UMD box to tell
         the unit to use the wartime requirements described in the UMD. Missions with
         mobility only taskings will have an X placed in the UTC box to tell the unit to use
         manpower details of UTCs listed in Section IIC of the SORTS DOC Statement.
290                                         AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009


         Units with a combined generation and mobility mission will list the UMD as the
         source document. Intelligence units may use MEMLs when matched by the UMD.
         The ―civilians‖ block will be marked with an X when US emergency essential or
         Key DOD civilians are part of the unit’s wartime requirement. Add additional notes
         as required.
         A2.8.3.1.3. Critical. Place an X in this box if the unit has critical AFSCs or packets
         listed in Chapter 3, Table 3.1 Critical personnel are those identified as essential to
         the launch, recovery, or turn around of a unit’s weapon system, or the direct
         accomplishment of the unit’s specified wartime mission. They are critical because
         their absence would materially effect the mission.
         A2.8.3.1.4. Civilians. Place an X in this box when the unit has emergency essential
         or Key DoD civilian requirements on UTC manpower details or coded emergency
         essential positions on the UMD. This directs units to include DoD emergency
         essential and Key civilian personnel requirements in C-level reporting but not
         personnel hired by host nation or contractors. Host nation or contractor personnel
         resources should be considered in commander assessment when relevant.
         A2.8.3.1.5. Additional Notes. Use this area to amplify other personnel measured area
         entries.
         A2.8.3.1.6. Split UTC tasking details (i.e. UIC, AFSCs, number of
         requirements, etc.). Include adequate details for the unit known to have resources
         it provides for the split UTC tasking and which it measures in SORTS. Also
         include the names and locations of the other unit(s) supporting the split UTC
         taskings.
      A2.8.3.2. Equipment and Supplies O/H Measured Area. This area of the SORTS DOC
      Statement lists general types of combat essential (major) equipment and general
      categories of support equipment and supplies to be measured. For each subarea in a
      category, list equipment followed by the subarea label (e.g., vehicles (ESSA4). If no
      subareas are used, use the EQSEE label for combat essential equipment and EQSSE for
      support equipment. Source document names can replace long lists. Add additional notes
      as needed.
         A2.8.3.2.1. Combat Essential Equipment. Enter all equipment subareas from
         Table 4.1, Column B and subarea equipment types from Table 4.4 for which the unit
         has equipment authorizations. Aerial port, LRS, and mission support units will also
         use Table 4.8, Table 4.10, and Table 4.11.
             A2.8.3.2.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) AFSOC LRS units will use Tables 4.12, 4.13,
             5.15 and Table 4.16, respectively.
         A2.8.3.2.2. Support Equipment and Supplies. Enter all equipment subareas in
         Table 4.1, Column C and subarea equipment types in Table 4.4 for which the unit
         has equipment and supplies authorizations. Aerial port units will also use Table 4.10.
             A2.8.3.2.2.1. Spare engines and MRSP/IRSP for Strategic airlift units will be
             reported by MAJCOM in their fleet report and will not be reported at the unit
             level. Units report nothing in fields ESSA1 and ESSA2.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                       291


           A2.8.3.2.2.2. Units will ensure engine requirements in their DOC reflect the
           most recent WRE requirements.
        A2.8.3.2.3. Additional Notes. Use this area to explain equipment and supplies
        O/H area entries to include:
           A2.8.3.2.3.1. Spares assessment driver for aircraft units. Indicate ASM,
           WSMIS-SAM, or RSP fill rates. Continue to use ASM unless your MAJCOM
           has authorized use of the WSMIS-SAM as an interim measure for reporting the
           spares subarea percentage. ASM is the primary means of determining the
           spares subarea percentage followed by the WSMIS-SAM (if approved by
           MAJCOM and HQ USAF/XOOA), then RSP fill rate when directed by parent
           MAJCOM.
           A2.8.3.2.3.2. All units with aircraft using ASM derived percentages for spare
           assessment will report IAW Table 4.9. Use the ASM as a commander’s tool to
           assess the unit’s overall C-level (if appropriate) and then report the ASM sortie
           percentage, ASM problem parts, and parts status in the ESSA1 remark.
     A2.8.3.3. Equipment Condition Measured Area. This area of the SORTS DOC
     Statement lists general types of combat essential (major) equipment and general
     categories of support equipment to be measured. Add additional notes as needed.
        A2.8.3.3.1. Combat Essential Equipment. Enter all equipment subareas from
        Table 5.1, Column B and subarea equipment types from Table 5.4 for which the
        unit has equipment and supplies authorizations. Aerial port, LRS, and mission
        support units will also use Table 5.14 through Table 5.16.
        A2.8.3.3.2. Support Equipment. Enter all equipment subareas from Table 5.1,
        Column C and subarea equipment types from Table 5.4 for which the unit has
        equipment and supplies authorizations. Aerial port units will also use Table 5.17.
        A2.8.3.3.3. Additional Notes. Use this area to explain equipment condition area
        entries to include long-term non-reportable items (e.g., excluded subsystems),
        sources for numbers required, and directions for special mission capabilities
        equipment if part of the unit’s full wartime requirement.
     A2.8.3.4. Training Measured Resource Area.
        A2.8.3.4.1. Training Method Used. The Air Force uses two training methods. Place
        an X in the appropriate Training Method block. (Training Method B and Training
        Method C, Option 1 or 2).
        A2.8.3.4.2. List the source document(s) for the training standard. If standards are not
        listed in a single document, list the most significant source in the area provided, and
        the other source documents in the additional notes area.
        A2.8.3.4.3. Additional Notes. Include additional training directives used, directions
        for special mission capability, equipment, and the types of training for each subarea
        from Table 6.4 followed by the subarea label. If there are no subareas, use TRUTC.
        Source document names can replace long lists.

   A2.8.4. Part IV, Amplifying Notes. Use this part of the SORTS DOC Statement to include the
   following:
      A2.8.4.1. For flying units, list capabilities being measured. Also, list special
      capabilities being reported but not measured. FAMs will select these special capabilities
      only from Table 2.3.
      A2.8.4.2. Any requirement for special capabilities reported in the TRSA2 field and the
      AFSPECAP set.
      A2.8.4.3. Overflow from additional note entries or descriptions of assumptions used
      for units with overlapping taskings between two or more OPLANS.

                 BASIC IDENTITY DATA ELEMENT (BIDE) REPORTING

A3.1. Basic Identity Data Element Purpose. Data entered through the BIDE set into the
SORTS database provides users with authoritative unit identity information. The BIDE set data
enables SORTS to fill its role as the central registry for all military units of the DoD. All AF
units with a PAS will be registered in SORTS.
   A3.1.1. Units with classified PAS codes (up to an including SECRET) will be registered. If
   the unit has a PAS code, the UIC will end with a zero ―0‖. In special cases, if the unit does
   not have a PAS code, the unit is formed from the parent unit. Use the parent UIC and
   substitute the 0 with a letter (A through Z). Units cannot reuse a previously registered unique
   UIC. If a subordinate unit merges with the parent UIC, then subsequently separates from the
   parent UIC again, the previous UIC should not be used for at least two years.
   A3.1.2. Provisional units will be registered. The Provisional Unit will register with its UIC
   first two digits of FH (FHXXXX). Provisional units formed from active units (FFXXXX)
   will use the third through fifth character of the parent UIC, an H in the second, and a sixth
   character that best indicates the provisional unit’s relationship to the parent. Examples: 41
   FW (FFABC0) to 41 FW Provisional [just the headquarters element] (FHABCA) or 66
   AS (FFSSS0) to 66 AS Provisional [whole unit deployed] (FHSSS0). Provisional units
   with a unique PAS code will be registered using the last four of that PAS for the second
   through fifth characters of the UIC. When the unit is registered, the ORGLOCN sets
   must be entered in addition to BIDE set.
A3.2. BIDE Set Usage. The BIDE set is used in the following four specific instances for
SORTS message processing:
      A3.2.1. Used by the RPTOR to initially register an organization in SORTS.
A3.2.2. Used to change previously reported data.
   A3.2.3. Used to delete data on a unit that inactivates/deactivates or was registered in error.
   A3.2.4. Used to validate unit registration.
A3.3. HQ USAF Responsibilities.
   A3.3.1. In concert with the JS and other Services, perform a semi-annual UIC validation.
A3.3.2. Notify RPTOR of any known database discrepancies for immediate corrective action.
   A3.3.3. Maintain an updated version of the AFSORTSDET-BIDE Entry Tool.
A3.4. Command Reporting Organizations (RPTOR) Responsibilities. All CROs prepare
and submit BIDE reports (including RPTNORG and ORGLOCN sets) on all Active, AF
Reserve, and Air National Guard units, including DETs assigned a PAS code.
   A3.4.1. RPTORs will register their units when they are listed in the PAS directory or
   G-Series orders, unless permission is granted by HQ USAF/XOOA to register them before
   they are listed. RPTORs must ensure unit registration data is kept current and available in the
   joint database. This includes adding or deleting missing or outdated information. Periodic
   comparisons will be undertaken to align PAS and BIDE records.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                          315


   A3.4.2. Individual measured units and SROs will not be responsible for BIDE reporting.
   A3.4.3. BIDE Data Validation to JCS. Use of the AFSORTSDET-BIDE Entry Tool will
   suffice as HQ USAF initial validation of BIDE data to the JS.
A3.5. Unit Registration.
   A3.5.1. Establishing Unit Identity. Identity is established in SORTS using the BIDE set. To
   initially register a unit, report all mandatory fields in the BIDE, RPTNORG, and
   ORGLOCN sets (according to Table A3.1, Table A3.2, and Table A3.3) using the ADD
   transaction code.
   A3.5.2. Changing Unit Registration Data. Using the CHANGE transaction code, report all
   mandatory and conditional fields that have changed since the unit’s initial registration.
       A3.5.2.1. After an initial BIDE report has been submitted use the TRANSFER set to
       change the RPTOR.
       A3.5.2.2. To delete existing data on a unit or when a unit has been registered in error,
       submit the BIDE report using the DELETE transaction code.
A3.6. AFSORTSDET-BIDE Entry Tool.
   A3.6.1. Reports and Checklists. The AFSORTSDET-BIDE Entry Tool contains three
   reports and their associated checklists: BIDE, RPTNORG, and ORGLOCN. Associated
   checklists allow plain language to be entered and then automatically converted into the
   appropriate codes/formats to be transmitted to the GSORTS processor.
       A3.6.1.1. The BIDE checklist contains all the necessary data to build a complete BIDE
       set for a specific UIC. With some fields requiring entered data or selecting the correct
       data from a list, and some data being derived.
           A3.6.1.1.1. The Basic Identity Status screen displays the current UIC in the upper left
           portion of the checklist.
           A3.6.1.1.2. Enter the appropriate data into the Basic Identity Status checklist and
           select the ACCEPT button.
       A3.6.1.2. The RPTNORG checklist contains all the necessary elements to build a
       complete RPTNORG set for a specific UIC. With some fields requiring entered data or
       selecting the correct data from a list.
           A3.6.1.2.1. The currently selected UIC is displayed in the upper left portion of the
           RPTNORG checklist.
           A3.6.1.2.2. The unit name is displayed in the upper middle portion of the checklist.
A3.6.1.2.3. Enter all appropriate data into the checklist and select the ACCEPT button.
       A3.6.1.3. The ORGLOCN checklist contains all the necessary elements to build a
       complete ORGLOCN set for a specific UIC. With some fields requiring entered data or
       selecting the correct data from a list.
           A3.6.1.3.1. The currently selected UIC is displayed in the upper left portion
           of the ORGLOCN checklist.
           A3.6.1.3.2. The unit name is displayed in the upper middle portion of the checklist.

      A3.7.1.1. Select the MSG HEADER button from the Select UIC window.
      A3.7.1.2. Enter the sending unit name, UIC, and ZULU time difference from its
      location.
      A3.7.1.3. Select the ACCEPT button.
   A3.7.2. The Select UIC window uses three UIC sets: BIDE, RPTNORG, and ORGLOCN.
      A3.7.2.1. Select the appropriate UIC from each set type that you want to appear on the
      message. Multiple UICs may be selected from each set type.
      A3.7.2.2. Select the ACCEPT button and this will build your message in USMTF
      format.
A3.8. BIDE Message Verification. Verify a correct sequence number on the BIDE message.
   A3.8.1. In the Message window select SEQUENCE button to display the Sequence window.
   A3.8.2. Select the appropriate sequence number or override.
      A3.8.2.1. SORTSREPAFs must arrive at the GSORTS processor in sequential order.
      A3.8.2.2. When using the label SEQNO, the sequence number is always a three-digit
      number. Make appropriate changes if the sequence number is not correct.
      A3.8.2.3. When using the label OVRRD, the GSORTS processor will ignore sequential
      processing and process the message in the order that it was received.
      A3.8.2.4. The override function may be used at the discretion of the MAJCOM
      SORTS Office provided, if involved, the MAJCOM, Wing and Unit assume
      responsibility for correction of any errors that may occur and take the necessary action to
      correct them.
      A3.8.2.5. In all cases use a sequential three-digit number followed by the letter Y
      (i.e., 001Y, 002Y, 003Y).

         NUCLEAR CHEMICAL BIOLOGICAL DEFENSE REPORT (CBDRT)

A4.1. Reporting CBDRT C-Level. An inherent part of every unit’s mission is the ability to
survive and operate in a nuclear, biological or chemical (NBC) contaminated environment.
IAW CJCSM 3150.02, Global Status of Resource and Training Systems (GSORTS), all SORTS
measured units are required to provide a separate readiness assessment in a CBDRT based on
the unit’s ability to perform its wartime mission for up to 96 hours IAW AFMAN 10-2602,
Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, Conventional (NBCC) Defense Operations and Standards, in a
NBC environment. This assessment is based on measurements of MRA NBC defense equipment
and the status of individual and unit level NBCC defense training.
   A4.1.1. The separate CBDRT report will be submitted concurrent with the unit’s primary
   SORTS report. The CBDRT includes an overall C-level rating, measured area level
   ratings for (1) NBC defense equipment and supplies and (2) NBCC defense training, and
   accompanying remarks to report a unit’s capability to perform its wartime mission in NBC
   conditions. These measured area ratings are specific to the unit’s NBC defense requirements
   and are to be reported in the CBDRT TREAD report. The CBDRT report may be a factor in
   the commander’s assessment of the unit’s primary overall SORTS C-level; however,
   CBDRT-specified calculation/measurements will not be reported in the regular SORTS
   reports. Units shall use AFSORTSDET version 1.3.8.9 or later to create the CBDRT SORTS
   report.
   A4.1.2. Measured units with no NBC defense equipment or training requirements must still
   submit a CBDRT report. They should report an overall C-5 with a S-6 in the equipment and
   a T-6 in the training areas with a REASON code of ―N‖ IAW AFI 10-201, Table A4.5 Also
   see paragraphs A4.2.2 and A4.3.1.
A4.2. NBC Defense Equipment and Supplies On-Hand Rating (ESRAT). The ESRAT is
based on the percentage of wartime NBC defense equipment that is MRA divided by the
quantity of NBC equipment required. The Equipment and Supplies area of the CBDRT report is
broken down into six categories of equipment (most units will report only Category 1) as shown
in Table A4.1. Report the ESRAT IAW Table A4.3 and enter the appropriate rating (S-level),
based on the lowest calculated equipment category that applies to the unit. For a CBDRT S-level
below S-1, state the reasons in the ESRES remark field of the CBDRT. Include the applicable
supply reason code (Table 4.5). If a unit does not have a requirement for a specific category of
NBC defense equipment, then enter a ―0‖ in that CBDRT equipment category.
   A4.2.1. Reporting ESRAT Percentages. All applicable units will list percentages for each
   category listed on the AFSORTSDET CBDRT page. Once information is filled in, and
   percentages are computed and accepted, a CBDRT ESRAT Remark is automatically
   formatted. Example of an automatic ESRAT Remark follows:

      /S10-MRA/0/S10-REQ/0/S10-PCT/NA//
     A4.2.1.1. For the detection category, enter only the data for the detection group with
     the lowest percentage MRA.
     A4.2.1.2. Do not enter data in S07 through S10. These entries area generated by the
     AFSORTSDET program, but are NOT used.
  A4.2.2. Enter plain text remarks identifying deficiencies and get well actions under the
  CBDRT ESRES remark field. The following is an unclassified example of an
  AFSORTSDET formatted ESRES remark:

   LABEL/U/A/LABEL:ESRES//
   GENTEXT/RMK/YYMMDD CATEGORY 1 SHORTAGE OF 27 C-1 MOBILITY
   BAGS. ADDRESSED TO MAJCOM FOR FURTHER ACTION.
   Estimated get-well date: DDMMMYY//

  A4.2.3. No Equipment Requirements. Units in a nuclear, biological, chemical, and
  conventional (NBCC) low threat area (LTA) (NBCC threat areas are explained in
  AFI 10-2501, Full Spectrum Threat Response (FSTR) Planning and Operations) with only
  an in-place mission, as identified by their DOC Statement or tasking system, have no NBC
  defense equipment requirements, unless otherwise specified by their MAJCOM. In this
  case, the unit should report a ―6‖ for the Equipment and Supplies subarea in the CBDRT
  report and ―SNM ― in ESRES.
  A4.2.4. Reportable NBC Equipment. (Table A4.1 can be used by MAJCOM FAMs to
  determine what categories their units should measure and report. The FAMs should
  identify which categories units are to measure and report within the add/ remark section of
  the unit’s DOC Statement.) The specific equipment items to measure in each category are
  listed in Table A4.2. Requirements vary based on unit mission and location. For units with
  both an in-place (generation) and a mobility mission, combine the requirements for
  reporting. Baseline Equipment Data Assessment List (BEDAL) equipment for first

  responders to weapons of mass destruction (WMD) incidents is not included in the
  CBDRT. The six equipment categories and applicable clarifications follow.
      A4.2.4.1. Category 1 Individual Protective Equipment (IPE). Count the number of C-1
      and D/ D-1 bags that are MRA, divided by the number required. AFI 10-2501, Table 8.1
      lists the required contents of C-1 bags. AFI 11-301V1, Aircrew Life Support (ALS)
      Program, lists the required contents of D/D-1 bags. To be MRA, a bag must contain 100
      percent of required items and each item must be serviceable IAW the applicable
      technical guidance. This 100 percent availability criteria is only for SORTS reporting.
      Unit commanders should follow guidance in AFI 10-403 and other MAJCOM guidance
      in determining risk of deploying individuals with partial IPE. paragraphs A4.2.4.1.1
      through A4.2.4.1.4 identify unit IPE requirements by location. paragraphs A4.2.4.1.5
      and A4.2.4.1.7 provide specific measurement and reporting instructions.
         A4.2.4.1.1. Continental United States (CONUS) units with a mobility mission or dual
         in-place and mobility mission: unit C-1 mobility bag requirements are established by
         AFI 10-2501 and MAJCOM guidance and should provide for every person assigned
         to a deployable UTC listed in Part IIc of the DOC Statement. When directed by the
         MAJCOM, flying units must have one D-bag equivalent for each aircrew member
         assigned to UTCs listed in the unit DOC Statement.
             A4.2.4.1.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) Aircrew in-flight Chemical War Defense
             Equipment (CWDE), including Aircrew Eye/Respiratory Systems (AERPS), will
             be counted as ―D-aircrew bags‖.
         A4.2.4.1.2. Outside CONUS (OCONUS) units in LTAs:
             A4.2.4.1.2.1. For a mobility mission, the unit must have the equivalent of one
             C-1 bag for every person assigned to a deployable UTC listed in Part IIC of the
             unit’s DOC Statement. As directed by MAJCOM, flying units must also have one
             D-1 and one D-bag equivalent for each assigned aircrew member IAW
             AFI 11-301, Vol 1.
             A4.2.4.1.2.2. For an in-place (generation) mission, there are no requirements.
             A4.2.4.1.3. OCONUS units in medium threat areas (MTAs):
             A4.2.4.1.3.1. For the mobility mission, the unit has a requirement of one C-1 bag
             equivalent for every person assigned to a deployable UTC listed in Part IIC of
             the unit DOC Statement.
             A4.2.4.1.3.2. For an in-place (generation) mission, a unit has a requirement
             of a C-1 mobility bag equivalent for all military and emergency essential
             civilian personnel assigned to the unit IAW AFI 10-2501.
             A4.2.4.1.3.3. As directed by the MAJCOM, flying units require one D-bag
             equivalent for each assigned aircrew member IAW AFI 11-301, Vol 1.
         A4.2.4.1.4. OCONUS units in high threat areas (HTAs):
             A4.2.4.1.4.1. Units have a requirement of a C-1 bag equivalent for all military
             and emergency essential civilian personnel assigned to the unit IAW
             AFI 10-2501.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                    323


           A4.2.4.1.4.2. As directed by the MAJCOM, flying units require one D-bag
           equivalent for each assigned aircrew member IAW AFI 11-301, Vol 1.
        A4.2.4.1.5. Instructions for units that get their C-1 mobility bags from an LRS:
        MAJCOMs will provide guidance to their reporting units on how to count and
        report on centrally stored bags. Use these criteria when preparing that guidance:
           A4.2.4.1.5.1. To provide consistency in reporting, the supporting LRS should
           calculate a base wide IPE availability percentage for centrally managed bags.
           This is calculated by dividing total MRA bags and bag equivalents by the
           total required (see paragraph A4.2.3.1.5.3 to establish the total centrally
           managed requirement). This percentage should be provided to all appropriate
           units to use in their CBDRT SORTS report. The supporting LRS must count the
           number of MRA tariff and individually sized bags that are or could be built up
           with resources O/H.
           A4.2.4.1.5.2. Units should report their unit IPE requirement (percentage of bags
           available) based on the LRS-provided percentage of available IPE. Units multiply
           the LRS-provided percentage by the number of bags required to determine the
           number of ―unit bags‖ to report as available/O/H.
           A4.2.4.1.5.3. Centrally managed requirements will be a sum of all unit
           requirements (as outlined in paragraphs A4.2.3.1 through A4.2.3.4) minus
           requirements for units that manage their own bags. All OCONUS units in MTAs
           and HTAs have C-1 bag requirements, but some of those units are not required
           to submit SORTS reports. Be sure to include the C-1 bag requirements for those
           units in this centrally managed total, unless those units manage their own bags.
           Per AFI 10-2501, the Installation Readiness Working Group will provide the
           total IPE requirements to the supporting LRS.
           A4.2.4.1.5.4. One bag or bag equivalent can be used to satisfy no more than one
           requirement. The total number of centrally stored bags reported available for
           all units, cannot exceed the number of complete bags (or bag equivalents) that
           are available in central storage plus the number of bags that have been issued to
           currently deployed personnel.
           A4.2.4.1.5.5. Count bags issued for real world deployments as available.
           A4.2.4.1.5.6. MAJCOMs can provide additional procedures in cases where C-1
           bag allocation is applied to priority units on a base.
        A4.2.4.1.6. Flying units must report IPE requirements for all required aircrew,
        ground crew and direct support unit personnel—not just on aircrew.
        A4.2.4.1.7. See paragraph A4.2.1 on reporting percentage information.
        A4.2.4.1.8. (Added-AFSOC) When an AFSOC Logistics Readiness Squadron
        (LRS) maintains Individual Protective Equipment (IPE) for other units, they will
        provide all applicable units with the base wide availability percentage of IPE. For
        example, if the LRS only has 80 percent of the required number of mobility bags;
        each unit whose bags are maintained at the LRS will report 80 percent MRA in their
        CBDRT report.

      A4.2.4.2. Category 2 Detection Equipment. Count the detection and monitoring
      equipment listed in Table A4.2, Column B, for UTCs listed in the unit DOC Statement
      and for in-place base support in MTAs and HTAs (do not include C-1 bag detection
      items (i.e., M8 and M9 paper) in this category). To count as MRA, category 2
      equipment must have enough serviceable batteries and support equipment O/H to
      support operations for up to 96 hours IAW AFMAN 10-2602. Divide MRA equipment
      by total number required for each detection group in this category. Report the category
      status based on the detection group with the lowest percent available. UTC requirements
      are listed in LOGFOR, AS, and/or HQ USAF functional area guidance.
         A4.2.4.2.1. MAJCOMs must specify in-place base support requirements for units
         in MTAs and HTAs.
         A4.2.4.2.2. See paragraph A4.2.1 on reporting percentage information.
      A4.2.4.3. Category 3 Decontamination Equipment. Count decontamination equipment
      listed in Table A4.2, column B, for UTCs listed in the unit DOC Statement and for
      in-place base support in MTAs and HTAs (do not include C-1 mobility bag detection
      items, i.e., M291 and M295 decontamination kits in this category). Divide MRA
      equipment by total number required. UTC requirements are listed in LOGFORs, ASs,
      and/or HQ USAF functional area guidance.
         A4.2.4.3.1. MAJCOMs must specify in-place base support decontamination
         equipment requirements for units in MTAs and HTAs.
         A4.2.4.3.2. See paragraph A4.2.1 on reporting percentage information.
      A4.2.4.4. Category 4 Radiation, Detection, Indication, and Computation (RADIAC)
      equipment. Count RADIAC equipment listed in Table A4.2, column B, for UTCs
      listed in the unit DOC Statement and for in-place base support in MTAs and HTAs.
      Divide MRA by total number required. To count as available, Category 4 equipment
      must have the required serviceable batteries and support equipment O/H. UTC
      requirements are listed in LOGFORs, ASs, and/or HQ USAF functional area
      guidance.
         A4.2.4.4.1. MAJCOMs must specify in-place base support equipment requirements
         for units in MTAs and HTAs.
         A4.2.4.4.2. See paragraph A4.2.1 on reporting percentage information.
      A4.2.4.5. Category 5 Medical Countermeasures. See paragraph A4.2.5.1.5.
      A4.2.4.6. Category 6 Collective Protection. Count the number of transportable collective
      protection systems, in Table A4.2, column B, that are MRA. Divide by total number
      required. To count as MRA, a collective protection system must have 100 percent of the
      critical components (those that are needed to make the system fully operational). All
      critical components must be serviceable in accordance with technical data on the report
      date. UTC requirements are listed in LOGFORs, ASs, and/or HQ USAF functional area
      guidance. See paragraph A4.2.1 on reporting percentage information.
   A4.2.5. Reportable Medical NBC Equipment. Medical units will report their equipment
   UTCs as follows:
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                      325


     A4.2.5.1. In cases of more than one item for a given field, enter the lowest percentage.
     Report only on equipment and supplies the unit is required to maintain. For units that
     possess no CBDRT material, as described below, report codes S-6 in ESRAT and SNM in
     ESRES. For categories two and three, do not report those items contained in C-1 bags.
     If the medical logistics (MEDLOG)/ defense medical logistics standard support
     (DMLSS) end-of-month (EOM) Stock Status Report reflects WRM project at zero
     percent, it represents a requirement with no material O/H and should be reported as such.
     UTCs that contain equipment in categories two, three, and four will still report their
     overall Material Availability Percentage (MAP) in the unit SORTS report in addition to
     the itemized reporting in the CBDRT portion of their SORTS report.

          Percentage (use the ESRAT)). If the critical equipment material availability
          percentage is less than 100 percent, the equipment is not considered MRA, and will
          be reported at zero percent, regardless of how much of the other material in the
          UTC is O/H. Divide the total number of these UTCs that are MRA by the number of
          UTCS required, and multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage to be reported under
          the ESRAT label.

           Example Calculations:
           FFCPA Critical O/H = 100 percent (MRA, count as 1)
           FFCPB Critical O/H = 99 percent (Not MRA, count as 0)
           FFCPW Critical O/H = 100 percent (MRA, count as 1)


           UTCs O/H/UTCs Required = percent
                   2           3      = 67 percent (report in ESSA6)

A4.3. Individual and Unit NBCC Defense Training Rating (TRRAT). The training
portion of the CBDRT report has two categories: individual NBCC defense training and unit
NBCC defense task qualification training (TQT). Determine the percent of personnel (or crews)
who are current in each training category. Based on the category with the lowest percent
available, report NBCC defense training status IAW Table A4.4 and enter the appropriate
T-level rating (TRRAT). TRRAT is calculated IAW applicable training methods of Chapter 6,
Method B (paragraph 6.2); Method C, Option 1 (paragraph 6.3), or Method C, Option 2
(paragraph 6.4). For units measuring under Method C, Option 2, use Table 6.3 Flying units
shall report training status for all required aircrews, ground crews and direct support unit
personnel. For a CBDRT T-level below T-1, insert the applicable training reason code (from
Table 6.5) in the TRRES field and explain the reasons in TRRES remarks. If a unit does not

have a requirement for a specific category of NBCC defense training, then enter a ―0‖ in the
required category.
   A4.3.1. No Training Requirements. Units in LTAs with only an in-place mission have no
   NBCC defense training requirements, unless otherwise specified by their MAJCOM. In
   this case, the unit should report a ―6‖ representing a non measured training subarea in the
   CBDRT report and TNM in TREAS.
   A4.3.2. Individual NBCC Defense Training. Count the number of military and emergency-
   essential civilian personnel who are current in individual NBCC Defense Training, divided
   by the total number of personnel assigned who are required to have the training
   (AFI 10-2501).
       A4.3.2.1. Units with a mobility mission: Every person assigned to a deployable UTC as
       listed in Part IIC of the unit’s DOC Statement is required to be current in this training.
       A4.3.2.2. Units assigned in either MTAs or HTAs: Every military and emergency-
       essential civilian assigned to the unit must be current in this training.
   A4.3.3. Unit NBCC Defense Task Qualification Training (TQT). Count the number of
   military and emergency-essential civilian personnel who are current in NBCC Defense
   TQT, divided by the total number of assigned personnel required to have the training.
   General NBCC Defense TQT requirements are listed in AFI 10-2501 and
   AFMAN 10-2602. To be TQT trained, unit personnel must be task trained using the general
   and functional NBCC defense tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) listed in
   AFMAN 10-2602, Attachment 4, all published HQ USAF functional area TTPs per
   AFMAN 10-2602, paragraph A4.1.2, and all unit identified TTPs per AFI 10-2501,
   paragraphs 2.11.2, 9.3.5, and 9.7.8.
   A4.3.4. The lowest percentage of paragraph A4.3.2 or A4.3.3 is used to assign a training
   level (T-level) under the TRRAT field IAW Table A4.4 State the reasons for a below T-1
   status in the TRRES field and the applicable training reason code from Table 6.5.
   A4.3.5. Training Remarks. TRRAT remarks are automatically formatted by the
   AFSORTSDET CBDRT page and list number of personnel who require training, the
   number who are current in their training, and the percent of personnel complete and
   current for each training category (individual NBC defense and unit level TQT). In plain
   text English, TRRES remarks should explain deficiencies and get well actions. The
   following are examples of the AFSORTSDET formatted remarks:

A4.4. Special NBC Defense Equipment and Supplies Reporting Requirements. To provide
visibility to installation-wide requirements and capabilities, CE units have an additional special
CBDRT reporting requirement. MAJCOMs will specify this special reporting requirement in
Section IV of a unit’s SORTS DOC Statement.
   A4.4.1. OCONUS CE Units in NBCC MTAs and HTAs. Once each quarter (in January,
   April, July, and October), report the status of in-place collective protection assets.
       A4.4.1.1. For an in-place mission in MTAs and HTAs, list the number of collective
       protection spaces that are required and the number that are MRA. To count as MRA, the
       shelter must be fully operational (see AFMAN 10-2602). If it is not, none of the spaces
       in that shelter can count as MRA.
       A4.4.1.2. MAJCOMs must specify in-place requirements. If theater or MAJCOM
       guidance is not provided, units should report MRA, rest and relief collective spaces for
       30 percent (assumes each space will support two people over a 24-hour period) of the
       in-place and deployed AF personnel plus the number of collective protection spaces used
       in medical, command and control, and other function-specific facilities. MAJCOMs will
       provide guidance as to how many additional spaces to include for the protection of
       transient aircrew and passengers into the collective protection calculation. Use any
       combination of Class I-IV transportable, fixed facility, or expedient collective protection
       systems to satisfy the total requirement. Do not include collective protection systems
       assigned to deployable UTCs. (See AFMAN 10-2602.)
       A4.4.1.3. In an ESRES remark, provide both the required and the MRA number of
       collective protection spaces. If reporting in-place requirements, this remark and the
       report must be classified SECRET. The following is an Unclassified example of the
       AFSORTSDET CBDRT formatted remark:

        GENTEXT/RMK/YYMMDD INPLACE COLLECTIVE PROTECTION SPACES /
        REQ 1300/ MRA 120//
A4.5. Overall CBDRT C-level. Unit Commanders will assign an overall CBDRT C-level
based on the lowest of the ESRAT and TRRAT. CBDRT overall C-level is assigned based on
definitions in paragraph 1.12, relevant to the unit’s ability to operate in CB conditions. An
overall C-level will be entered in the READY field under TREAD = CBDRT report. If
applicable, a primary reason (in plain text) should be stated under the CBDRT TREAD
REASN remark label, while using an applicable reason code from Table 4.5 and Table 6.5
for the area ratings. CBDRT reports will be submitted in conjunction with the unit’s primary
SORTS report. Commander CBDRT assessments are not applicable to CBDRT reports,
however the CBDRT overall rating can be factored into commander assessments of overall unit

A4.6. CBDRT Data Requirements. Table 4.5 and Table 6.5 list applicable reason codes for
use with CBDRT. No FORECAST Set data is required. Only applicable Equipment and
Training reason codes listed in Table 4.5 and Table 6.5 will be used for CBDRT overall and
subarea level ratings (S-level, and T-level). Use the REASN code from Table A4.5 for the
CBDRT overall rating.

   MAJOR EQUIPMENT LOCATION AND CREW INFORMATION (MEQLOCN)

A5.1. MEQLOCN Description.
   A5.1.1. MEQLOCN is a major equipment location set reported in SORTS for those units
   possessing major equipment (aircraft, missiles, etc.).
   A5.1.2. MEQLOCN is used to report the location and status of major equipment items
   and crews authorized to the unit.
      A5.1.2.1. Includes MEQPT and crew status at a unit’s present and deployed locations.
      A5.1.2.2. Equipment and crews that will be off station for less than 72 hours (with
      response time not a key factor) are not considered deployed and do not need to be
      reported in a separate MEQLOCN set.
      A5.1.2.3. Major equipment in PDM are not reported in a separate MEQLOCN set,
      account for major equipment in PDM in a remark using the ―MEPSD‖ Label.
A5.2. Reporting Information.
   A5.2.1. MEQLOCN sets report on the type of equipment, the number of crews at a given
   location, and the location of deployed equipment and/or crews.
   A5.2.2. Total numbers, reported for unit resource data (equipment and crews), at various
   locations must equal total assigned, possessed, formed, and mission ready.
   A5.2.3. MEQLOCN sets are reported as a stand alone set of a unit’s SORTS report. A
   unit will develop and maintain their MEQLOCN set(s) using the current AFSORTSDET
   version.
      A5.2.3.1. Submit the MEQLOCN set on a unit authorized or possessing major
      equipment items. Submit the set for each combination of major equipment, type, and
      location to show status at all locations being occupied by the unit. There is no limit to
      the number of MEQLOCN sets a unit may report.
      A5.2.3.2. MEQLOCN sets are reported using an Add, Change or Delete set transaction
      code. The Add transaction code should ONLY be used the very first time a MEQLOCN
      set is added to the database. Any subsequent reporting of the MEQLOCN sets that are
      changing data should utilize the Change transaction. If the set is to be deleted, the Delete
      transaction code is used. If a unit continuously uses the Add transaction code, the number
      of equipment and crews will constantly double with each report, causing the unit’s
      database to have incorrect data.
      A5.2.3.3. When submitting MEQLOCN sets, units should ensure the numbers of
      deployed crews or equipment do not exceed the total number possessed, and change
      accordingly. SORTS reporting personnel must know what is in the database for the UIC
      being reported.
      A5.2.3.4. When a unit deletes the number of previously reported equipment at deployed
      locations, the system will return equipment numbers back to the home or UNIT location.

      A5.2.3.5. Units should ensure that the proper security classification value is applied
      to each MEQLOCN set every time it is reported.
      A5.2.3.6. The following examples of USMTF reporting are provided for reference:
          A5.2.3.6.1. Adding a MEQLOCN set should look like the following:
           MEQLOCN/U/A/MEQPT:C-130E/-/MEPSA:30/MEPSD:30/-/-/-/-
           /CREWA:30/CREWF:30/ /

          A5.2.3.6.2. Moving equipment or personnel from the unit to a deployed location:

           MEQLOCN/U/C/MEQPT:C-130E/-/MEPSA:11/MEPSD:11/-/-/-/-
           /CREWA:11/CREWF:11/ -/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/NEWLOC:CNBC//

          A5.2.3.6.3. Moving equipment/personnel from a deployed location to a home
          location:

 TRANSPORTABLE COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT AND PERSONNEL DATA.
             (UTC PACKAGE DEPLOYABILITY STATUS)

A6.1. Required Actions:
   A6.1.1. Identify the package being reported on. Units may be required to provide a number
   of the same UTC packages. To uniquely identify a package, enter two secondary control
   elements according to the following:
      A6.1.1.1. Check the DOC Statement for the UTC. Enter it under the label UTC each
      time there’s a ―PACKAGE‖ transaction.
      A6.1.1.2. Find the Designated Item Serial Number using the following rules and enter it
      under the Designated Item Serial Number (MESEN) label each time there’s a
      ―PACKAGE‖ transaction.
          A6.1.1.2.1. For Equipment and Personnel UTCs check for a force requirement
          number (FRN) in plan’s time-phased force and deployment data (TPFDD). If
          there’s an FRN, use its first three characters as the first three characters and a
          sequence number (e.g., 1, 2, etc.) as the last character of the MESEN. If there isn’t an
          FRN, use a four-digit sequence number (e.g., 0001, 0002, etc.).
          A6.1.1.2.2. For Equipment UTCs use the first four characters of the major
          equipment’s serial number as MESEN.
          A6.1.1.2.3. For Personnel UTCs use ―P‖ as the first character and a three-digit
          sequence number as the last three characters (e.g., P001, P002, etc.) of MESEN.
      A6.1.1.3. For the DOC Listed UTC(s) enter a ―Y‖ if tasked or an ―N‖ if not tasked,
      under label DTASK.
   A6.1.2. Show Major Equipment Operational Status for Specified Package. Commanders
   will select the operational status in Table A6.1, which most closely matches the current
   status of the prime equipment required by the package. If changed, enter it under label Prime
   Equipment Operational Status (PEQS). If status is other than ―not applicable‖ or ―prime
   equipment is fully operational,‖ forecast the date the equipment will be fully operational. If
   changed, enter it under label PEQFR.
   A6.1.3. Show Support Equipment Operational for Specified Package. Commanders will
   select the operational status in Table A6.2, which most closely matches the current status of
   the support equipment required by the package. If changed, enter it under label Support
   Equipment Status (SEDY). If status is other than ‖not applicable‖ or ―support equipment is
   fully operational,‖ forecast the date the equipment will be fully operational. If changed,
   enter it under label Support Equipment Forecast Ready Date (SEQFR).

  A6.1.4. Show the Assigned Team Status for Specified Package. Commanders will select the
  team status in Table A6.3, which most closely matches the status of the personnel required
  by the specified package. If changed, enter it under the label for Assigned Team Status
  (TEDY). If status is other than ―not applicable‖ or ―assigned team status is satisfactory,‖
  forecast the date the team will be operational. If changed, enter it under the label for Team
  Status Satisfactory Forecast Date (TEAFR).
   A6.1.5. Show the Overall Operational Condition and Deployment Status of Specified UTC
   Package. Commanders will select the overall operational condition and deployability
   status in Table A6.3, which most closely matches the current status of the specified
   package. If changed, enter it under the Expected Availability Category (EXDAC) label. If
   the status is:
      A6.1.5.1. UTC is redeployable, deployed, or en route, check the actual deployment
      date. If changed, enter it under the label for UTC Forecast Ready Date (UTCFR).
      A6.1.5.2. UTC is committed, forecast the deployment date. If changed, enter in UTCFR.
      A6.1.5.3. Either of the above, show status of the deployed or committed UTCs. If a
      UTC is deployed or committed to deploy, report this data depending on the status
      showing using the EXDAC field:
          A6.1.5.3.1. In the Deployment Control Number (DCN), if reporting that the UTC is
          deployed, committed, or en route, check the deployment tasking number, departure
          control number, or deployment control number issued by the MAJCOM for the
          specified UTC package movement. If the number is unknown, use ―XXXXX‖ as the
          number. If changed, enter it under label DCNDY.
          A6.1.5.3.2. For Equipment Return Date, if reporting UTC is redeployable,
          committed, deployed, or en route, forecast the date the specified package is
          expected to return from deployment. If changed, enter it under the label for
          Equipment Return Date (EQRET).
          A6.1.5.3.3. For GEOLOC Code, if reporting UTC is redeployable, committed,
          deployed, or en route, find the GEOLOC code matching the specified package’s
          present location in the GEOFILE. If changed, enter it under the label for
          Geographical Location of Equipment (GEOGR).
      A6.1.5.4. Other than those above, or if the UTC is fully operational and deployable,
      forecast the date the package will be operational and deployable. Anytime the EXDAC is
      other than ―A‖ enter it under the label UTCFR.
  A6.1.6. Prepare remarks to explain the situation. When they occur, prepare remarks to
  explain any of the situations listed below. Don’t duplicate remarks if situations have same
  explanations.
      A6.1.6.1. When specified UTCs have sub-elements deployed state which sub-
      elements are deployed, the deployment number, the estimated return date, and the UTC
      operational capability remaining. Create the remark under the label EXDAC.
      A6.1.6.2. When a unit has major equipment deficiencies explain the impact the
      deficiencies have on UTC operational and deployment capability, also identify
      corrective actions taken. Create the remark under the PEQS label.
AFI10-201_AFSOCSUP_I 01 OCTOBER 2009                                                      341


     A6.1.6.3. When a unit has support equipment deficiencies explain the impact the
     deficiencies have on UTC operational and deployment capability, also identify corrective
     actions taken. Create the remark under the SEDY label.
     A6.1.6.4. When a unit has personnel deficiencies explain the impact the deficiencies
     have on UTC operational and deployment capability, also identify corrective actions
     taken. Create the remark under the TEDY label.
  A6.1.7. Submit ―PACKAGE‖ with the unit SORTS report. Ensure accurate data is reflected
  each time a unit SORTS report is submitted. Take add, delete, or change action as necessary.

1.2. Measured Units Reporting Requirement. Measured units are all planned and actual
(JTF) HQs, combat, combat support, combat services support units including Active, Air
National Guard, AF Reserves and provisional units apportioned to or deployed in support of
a CJCS or combatant command-directed OPLAN, Concept Plans, SIOP, Operations Plan
8044 Revision 03 or Volume 3 of the USAF War and Mobilization Plan (WMP-3), or
assigned in the ―Forces For Unified Commands‖ document. Measured units will be named on
a DOC Statement (DOCS) and must report SORTS in accordance with their DOCS. One
exception is training units that report only Major Equipment Location and Crew Information
(MEQLOCN). Measured unit SORTS reporting begins as soon as possible after a unit
activates and continues until the unit deactivates.
1.4.3. SORTS Readiness Data. Measured area category levels, overall category levels,
numbers used to compute percentages and the percentages (when associated with SORTS),
reason codes associated with their remarks, and limiting factors for a single unit, are, at a
minimum, classified CONFIDENTIAL. Products that contain data from two or more
measured units is classified SECRET NOFORN. Additionally, individuals classifying
SORTS reports must consider other classification guidance including OPLANS. The
association of the unit with its OPLAN(s) tasking is classified at the level of classification of
the OPLAN(s), usually SECRET. Information that is not SORTS based and does not show a
deficiency may still require classification through channels other than SORTS. Unit and Wing
Security Managers should be consulted in these events.
1.6.4. General Status Organization and Location (ORGLOCN). ORGLOCN applies to all
registered units, includes codes for CC/Service Command (CSERV), commands with
Operational Control (OPCON), Administrative Control (ADCON), unit’s Home
Geographical Location (HOGEO) and Present Geographical Location (PRGEO), Activity
Code (ACTIV), and Percent Effective (PCTEF). Only CROs report this data with the
exception of PCTEF, which is reported by the measured unit.

1.10.8.1.4. Availability of contractors to provide services in support of generation mission.
2.7. Use of the Percent Effective (PCTEF) Field. PCTEF provides a subjective assessment
of the unit’s ability to execute its currently assigned nontraditional mission. When employed
in support of a nontraditional mission, commanders will report PCTEF. PCTEF reporting is
required upon receipt of an order to execute any of the following missions: Homeland Defense
or Homeland Security missions in support of USNORTHCOM and USPACOM (including
quick reaction force and/or ready reaction force missions), peacekeeeping or peace
enforcement operations, humanitarian assistance, consequence management, counterdrug
operations, civil distrubance operations, and natural disaster relief operations (including
wildfire fighting missions). In some cases, a unit executing assigned nontraditional operation
will be executing its wartime tasks in support of that nontraditional mission (e.g., a Civil
Engineering unit providing support to a natural disaster relief operation). In those cases,
commanders will use their discretion to determine if PCTEF reporting is required.
2.7.1. PCTEF will not necessarily correlate with a unit’s Overall C-level. For example, if the
unit is currently assigned a nontraditional mission, PCTEF will capture the commander’s
assessment against this nontraditional mission while the Overall C-level will continue to
assess the unit’s ability to execute its full wartime tasking(s). To report the impact on a unit’s
C-level from deployed resources, commanders needs to use DEFG (see paragraph 2.8).
2.7.3. Commander’s remarks are mandatory when reporting in the PCTEF field. Using plain
text under the PCTEF label, identify the mission assigned (e.g., Tsunami Relief Operations.)
current status, and/or any action underway or planned to remedy a current reduced readiness
condition for assigned missions. Format the PCTEF remark according to the example below:
      Percent Effective (2), Tsunami Relief Operations, status reflects reduced/increased
      effectiveness due to reason(s), e.g., Tsunami Relief Operations deployment tasking cannot
      be fully supported due to shortage of (personnel, equipment and supplies o/h, equipment
      condition, and/or training). To alleviate the situation on (area), the unit will (action). Get
      well date (gwd) is estimated to be (date). Estimated departure/return date is (date).

  NOTES:
      1. X means all AFSCs in source that match remaining characters are critical AFSCs.
         * means all suffixed and non-suffixed AFSCs in the source document that match
         remaining characters are critical. Consider AFSCs that convert as critical.
      2. HQ AF/A3OR, as authorized may augment this table by message. MAJCOM SORTS
         offices will disseminate the supplemented message to subordinate units.
      3. Rule 2 Aeromedical units use ―X‖ as a prefix to identify flight qualification. In this
         case, ―X‖ does not have the same significance as in note 1 above.
      4. Rule 21 AFSC 6C091 may be substituted for a 64P3.
      5. Rule 13 Number of personnel tasked under UTC is listed on unit DOC Statement.

         Two mobility positions for AFSC 2S0X1 fall under UTC XFBPF, however, the
         second position is non-critical.
      6. Rule 13 Four of the 13 mobility positions per XFBJ1 UTC are critical. The remaining
          nine positions, regardless of AFSC, are non-critical.
      7. Rule 13 The mobility position per XFBKB UTC is critical.
      8. Rule 13 Both of the mobility positions per XFBYC UTC are critical and will not be
          substituted.
      9. Rule 13 One of the three mobility positions per JFBBS UTC. Remaining two positions
          are not critical.
      10. Rule 32 Aircraft operations support, theater hub (non-aircraft), depot munitions
          activity (STAMP/ TARRP), and units providing nuclear capabilities.
      11. Rule 24 Emergency essential and key DOD civilians must be identified and coded as
          such in their position description.
4.3. Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) General Policy. BEAR units report

NOTES:
1. Rule 43 To be mission ready, a communications central must have the capability to transmit
and receive secure communications on HF/Single Side Band (SSB), UHF/AM HAVE QUICK,
and VHF/frequency modulation (FM) high-power pallet mounted radios and be mounted in a
mission ready and available tactical vehicle.
2. Rule 43 A TAC kit is MRA when the following items are MRA: TACP Close Air Support
System, laser range finder, thermal imager/laser spot viewer, and GPS receiver.
3. To compute percentage divide the quantity MRA by the quantity authorized and multiply the
result by 100. This must be done for each UTC, use the lowest percentage to determine the
support equipment condition.
4. Rule 32a Aircraft assigned and directly support aircraft operations; excludes nuclear support
equipment.
5. Rule 32b Munitions service-level and theater swing-stock support activity (non-aircraft; even
if stocks support aircraft; theater hubs, STAMP, TARP).

3. Rule 15 BMC, CMR and SPECAP subcategories apply only to Rule 15, Combat Air Forces.
4. Rule 19 For those units with a Combat Camera (COMCAM) or Visual Information (VI)
mobility mission, members must complete the COMCAM Contingency Support course at least
once. Such training is considered valid as long as the member is assigned to subsequent
COMCAM or VI units. Assignment outside such a mobility environment not including extended
TDYs, short tours or specialized training under one year nullifies currency of this training,
requiring the member to re-accomplish. COMCAM and/ or VI unit commanders may, at their
discretion, choose to send members to the training beyond the minimum requirement as
readiness dictates. Air Force Aircrew Survival Training (for appropriately qualified aircrew
personnel) may substitute for the COMCAM Contingency Support course, consistent with the
rules described above.
5. Rule 12 Training must include a command approved ABDR; engineer, general assessor,
technical course, and support at least one CLSS field exercise (Hardstand) as an engineer.

A3.1.2. Provisional units will be registered. The Provisional Unit will register with its UIC first
two digits of FH (FHXXXX). Provisional units formed from active units (FFXXXX) will use the
third through fifth character of the parent UIC, an H in the second, and a sixth character that best
indicates the provisional unit’s relationship to the parent. Examples: 41 FW (FFABC0) to 41 FW
Provisional [just the headquarters element] (FHABCA) or 66 AS (FFSSS0) to 66 AS Provisional
[whole unit deployed] (FHSSS0). Provisional units with a unique PAS code will be registered
using the last four of that PAS for the second through fifth characters of the UIC. When the unit
is registered, the ORGLOCN sets must be entered in addition to BIDE set.
A3.4. Command Reporting Organizations (RPTOR) Responsibilities. All CROs prepare and
submit BIDE reports (including RPTNORG and ORGLOCN sets) on all Active, AF Reserve,
and Air National Guard units, including DETs assigned a PAS code.
A3.5.1. Establishing Unit Identity. Identity is established in SORTS using the BIDE set. To
initially register a unit, report all mandatory fields in the BIDE, RPTNORG, and ORGLOCN sets
(according to Table A3.1., Table A3.2., and Table A3.3.) using the ADD transaction code.

                              Attachment 8 (ADDED-AFSOC)
   AIR FORCE SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND (AFSOC) SORTS TRAINING
                            OBJECTIVES

A8.1. (Added-AFSOC) AFSOC SORTS Training Program. In accordance with this
supplement’s instruction, SRO/COMREPs are responsible for providing initial and quarterly
refresher training to SORTS and Direct Support Unit (DSU) monitors. Training for unit and
DSU commanders and applicable alternates will be conducted initially upon receipt of duties and
annually thereafter.
   A8.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) The training plan must be in accordance with Table A8.1,
   AFSOC SORTS Training Objectives, as a foundation. Local procedures are up to the
   SRO/COMREPs discretion. These training procedures can range from an in-class
   environment, a PowerPoint slide show, a newsletter, an open book test(s), etc.
   A8.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) The main purpose is to ensure all subjects are taught at least
   annually and each individual has a clear understanding of SORTS and his or her part in the
   SORTS process. The SRO/COMREP must have each year’s training program agenda
   established at the beginning of each calendar year. Note: Building the yearly training
   program agenda in its entirety will provide anyone conducting an inspection of the
   SRO/COMREPs program the intention of the current training program no matter what time
   of year the inspection takes place.
   A8.1.3. (Added-AFSOC) How to track each individual’s SORTS training progress is at the
   judgment of the SRO/COMREP. The tracking program should be based on a calendar year,
   beginning with January.      Each calendar year’s tracking program should annotate
   accomplished training from the previous year. Note: Do not destroy documentation of initial
   or SORTS MTT training.
   A8.1.4. (AFSOC) HQ AFSOC FAMs will receive initial SORTS training from HQ
   AFSOC/DOCR. Only objectives with a ―*‖ are applicable to FAMs.
A8.2. (Added-AFSOC) AFSOC SORTS Training Objectives. It is recommended the
objectives listed in Table A8.1 be accomplished by training topic instead of by individual
subject objective.
   A8.2.1. (Added-AFSOC) Because of the number of objective subjects, more than one
   subject must be reviewed quarterly. Additionally, the SRO/COMREP should include
   training based on areas he or she feels need special attention or could/needs to show room for
   improvement.
