                                             Chapter 1

                         OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY PROGRAM

1.1. Basic Guidelines.
     1.1.1. Records that are retrieved by name or other personal identifier of a U.S. citizen or
     alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence are subject to Privacy Act requirements and
     are referred to as a Privacy Act system of records. The Air Force must publish SORNs in the
     Federal Register, describing the collection of information for new, changed or deleted
     systems to inform the public and give them a 30 day opportunity to comment before
     implementing or changing the system. (See Attachment 2).
        1.1.1.1. In the Privacy process, The Privacy Act of 1974 defines the term "record" as any
        item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an
        agency, including, but not limited to, education, financial transactions, medical history,
        and criminal or employment history and that contains name, or the identifying number,
        symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a finger or
        voice print or a photograph.
        1.1.1.2. In the Records Management process, 44 U.S.C., Section 3301 defines the term
        “records” as all books, papers, maps, photographs, machine readable materials, or other
        documentary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received
        by an agency of the United States Government under Federal law or in connection with
        the transaction of public business and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that
        agency or its legitimate successor as evidence of the organization, functions, guidance,
        decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the Government or because of the
        informational value of data in them.” Records Management has a broader definition of
        “record” than the Privacy Act definition.
     1.1.2. An official Privacy Act system of records is:
        1.1.2.1. Authorized by law or Executive Order or regulation; and
        1.1.2.2. Necessary to carry out an Air Force mission or function; and
        1.1.2.3. Published in the Federal Register.
     1.1.3. The Air Force shall not :
        1.1.3.1. Keep records on how a person exercises First Amendment rights. First
        Amendment rights include, but are not limited to, freedom of religion, freedom of
        political beliefs, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right to assemble, and the
        right to petition. EXCEPTIONS are when: The Air Force has the permission of that
        individual or is authorized by Federal statute; or the information pertains to and is within
        the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity.
        1.1.3.2. Penalize or harass an individual for exercising rights guaranteed under the
        Privacy Act.

  1.1.4. Air Force members shall:
     1.1.4.1. Keep paper and electronic records that are retrieved by name or personal
     identifier only in approved Privacy Act systems of records which have notices published
     in the Federal Register.
     1.1.4.2. Collect, maintain, and use information in such systems ONLY for purposes
     described in the published system of records notice to support programs authorized by
     law, executive order, regulation, or policy.
     1.1.4.3. Safeguard the records in the system, keep them the minimum time required, and
     dispose of them according to disposition instructions.
     1.1.4.4. Ensure records are timely, accurate, complete, and relevant.
     1.1.4.5. Amend and correct information in Privacy Act records upon request, as
     appropriate.
     1.1.4.6. Allow individuals to review and receive copies of their own Privacy Act records

          COLLECTING PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM INDIVIDUALS

2.1. Each agency that maintains a system of records shall:
   2.1.1. Maintain in its records only such information about an individual as is relevant and
   necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be accomplished by statute,
   executive order or their implementing regulations;
   2.1.2. Collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject
   individual when the information may result in adverse determinations about an individual's
   rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs;
   2.1.3. Inform each individual whom it asks to supply information, on the form which it uses
   to collect the information or on a separate form that can be retained by the individual. This is
   otherwise known as a Privacy Act Statement (PAS). A PAS may be provided verbally or in
   writing. A sign may also be displayed with the PAS in the area where the information is
   routinely requested;
       2.1.3.1. Authority: the legal authority that authorizes the solicitation of the information
       and whether the disclosure of such information is mandatory or voluntary;
       2.1.3.2. Purpose: the principal purpose or purposes for which the information is intended
       to be used;
       2.1.3.3. Routine Uses: Who will have access to the information outside the DoD.
       2.1.3.4. Disclosure: Voluntary or Mandatory. (Use Mandatory only when disclosure
       is required by law and the individual will be penalize d for not providing
       information; must have SJA review). Include any consequences of nondisclosure in
       nonthreatening language.
   2.1.4. Examples of when it is more practicable to collect information from a third party
   about another individual, instead of the subject individual, include:
       2.1.4.1. Verification of information through third-party sources for security or
       employment suitability determinations;

  record. When the same information is solicited for a Privacy Act record, the notification is
  referred to as a PAS. If PII is solicited on a DoD Web site (e.g., collected as part of an email
  feedback/comments feature on a Web site) and the information is not maintained in a Privacy
  Act system of records, the solicitation of such information triggers the requirement for a
  privacy advisory.
  2.2.2. Privacy Act Statement in Publications. Include a Privacy Act Advisory Statement in
  each Air Force publication that requires collecting or keeping personal information in a
  system of records. Also include a Statement when publications direct collection from the
  individual of any part or form of the SSN. The Statement will refer to the legal authority for

     protected under the Freedom of Information Act of 1966 and Privacy Act of 1974, as
     amended. Unauthorized disclosure or misuse of this PERSONAL INFORMATION may
     result in criminal and/or civil penalties”
     2.2.3.2. Paper documents and printed materials that contain PII shall be covered with the
     AF Form 3227 or DD Form 2923, Mar 2009, Privacy Act Cover Sheet (see paragraph
     9.4.3) when removed from a system of records.
 2.2.4. The Privacy Act requires agencies to provide safeguards to ensure the security and
 confidentiality of Privacy Act records and to protect individuals against an invasion of
 personal privacy. Refer to AFI 33-129, Transmission of Information Via the Internet, for the
 appropriate procedures required to send Privacy Act information across the Internet.
 2.2.4.1. Exercise caution before transmitting personal information over E- mail to ensure the
 message is adequately safeguarded. Some information may be so sensitive and personal that
 E- mail may not be the proper way to transmit it. When sending personal information over E-
 mail within DoD, ensure:
     2.2.4.2. There is an official need.

AFI33-332_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 26 JULY 2011                                                      15


   statement at the beginning of the e- mail: “The information herein is For Official Use Only
   (FOUO) which must be protected under the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. Unauthorized
   disclosure or misuse of this PERSONAL INFORMATION may result in criminal and/or civil
   penalties.” Do not indiscriminately apply this statement to E-mails. Use it only in situations
   when you are actually transmitting personal information for official purposes within the
   Government. See DoD 5200.1-R Information Security Program. Note: The guidance in this
   paragraph does not apply to appropriate releases of personal information to members of the
   public via e- mail, such as pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, or with the consent of
   the subject of the personal information.
   2.2.6. Do not send Privacy Act information to distribution lists or group e- mail addresses
   unless each member has an official need to know the personal information. Official e- mails
   messages will be digitally signed and encrypted (MGS). Before forwarding E-mails you have
   received that contain personal information, verify that your intended recipients are authorized
   to receive the information under The Privacy Act.
2.3. Social Security Number (SSN) Reduction. The stated intention of the Social Security
Reduction Plan is to reduce or eliminate the use of SSN in DoD a nd AF systems of records, IT
systems and forms. The Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for SSN Reduction shall be the
data owner of systems of records, IT systems and AF forms with assistance from the Records
Professional, the Privacy Official, and Forms Manager. The use of the SSN shall be limited to
transactions that specifically require the presentation of the SSN to meet a statutory or regulatory
requirement. Most applications that require the SSN for specific transactions do not require its
use for every transaction. For example, systems that link to financial institutions may need the
SSN for initial interactions, but thereafter use an account number or some other form of
identification or authentication. As such there is no need to use the SSN for individuals to
authenticate themselves as part of every transaction. Prior to the issuance of the DoD Instruction,
the Directive Type Memorandum (DTM)-07-015-USD (P&R), DoD Social Security Number
(SSN)               Reduction               Plan,              28            Mar              2008,
http://www.defenselink.mil/privacy/files/SSNReductionPlan.pdf is in effect and establishes:
   2.3.1. Acceptable Uses. Use of the SSN includes the SSN in any form, including, but not
   limited to truncated, masked, partially masked, encrypted, or disguised SSN. The acceptable
   uses of the SSN are those that are provided for by law, require interoperability with
   organizations beyond the Department of Defense, or are required by operational necessities.
   Such operational necessities may be the result of the inability to alter systems, processes, or
   forms due to cost or unacceptable levels of risk. Those systems, processes, or forms that
   claim “operational necessity” shall be closely scrutinized. Ease of use and unwillingness to
   change are not acceptable justifications for this case.
   2.3.2. Documenting Acceptable Uses of PII and SSN specifically. The authorization for use
   of PII is governed through the DoD Privacy Program. The method by which SSN use is
   documented shall be consistent with existing Privacy program requirements for forms,
   processes, IT systems, and systems of records, to include any locally created applications.
       2.3.2.1. In addition to the documentation required for the use of PII in the PIA and/or
       SORN, the use of the SSN in any form as part of any collection, transfer, or retention
       including locally created user applications must be specifically documented and justified.
16                               AFI33-332_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 26 JULY 2011


     Documentation for SSN justification shall be retained and available upon request. This
     documentation shall include:
         2.3.2.1.1. The specific requirement for use of the SSN.
         2.3.2.1.2. A senior official (flag officer or SES equivalent) shall sign a memorandum
         stating the justification for use of the SSN. It is unacceptable to collect, retain, use or
         transfer SSN without an approved justification.
            2.3.2.1.2.1. Justification memo to collect SSN in an IT System shall be forwarded
            with the PIA and/or SORN to the AF Privacy Officer. The justification memo will
            be addressed to Defense Privacy Official for approval/disapproval. (See
            Attachment 6)
            2.3.2.1.2.2. Forms that collect SSN must have a completed DD Form 67 or AF
            Form 673, (whichever is applicable IAW AFI 33-360) and a justification memo
            (IAW paragraph 2.3.2.1.2.1) that is addressed to and approved by DoD Privacy
            Officer. Submit items to appropriate Forms Manager IAW AFI 33-360.
         2.3.2.1.3. The Defense Privacy Officer reviews SSN justifications for IT systems as
         an adjunct to the biennial PII review process. Where a justification for SSN use is
         rejected, the action officer will prepare a plan, to include milestones and a timeline,
         for the elimination of SSN usage.
  2.3.3. Periodic Review of SSN Use and Justification. SSN use and justification memo
  review is a responsibility under the biennial review process for all forms. IT systems
  justification memo shall be reviewed for this purpose in conjunction with the FISMA Annual
  review.
  2.3.4. Requesting the Social Security Number (SSN). When requesting an individual‟s SSN
  always give a Privacy Act Statement when the SSN will be placed in a Privacy Act record, or
  otherwise provide a Privacy Advisory to the individual as to why their SSN is being
  collected, for what purpose it will be used, and whether disclosure is mandatory.
  2.3.5. The Air Force requests an individual‟s SSN and provides the Privacy Act Statement
  required by law when anyone enters military service or becomes an Air Force civilian
  employee. Confirmation of Employment Eligibility is an acceptable use. The Air Force uses
  the SSN as a service or employment number to reference the individual‟s official records.
  When you ask an Air Force service member or employee for an SSN as identification in the
  context of this stated use to retrieve an official record, you do not have to restate this
  information.
     2.3.5.1. Alternative Means of Identifying Records. When law, executive order, or
     regulation does not require disclosing the SSN or when the system of records was created
     after January 1, 1975, you may ask for the SSN, but the individual does not have to
     disclose it. If the individual refuses to respond, use alternative means of identifying
     records. Executive Order 9397, Numbering System for Federal Accounts Relating to
     Individual Persons, November 22, 1943, has been amended by Executive Order 13478,
     Amendments to Executive Order 9397 Relating to Federal Agency Use of Social Security
     Numbers, November 18, 2008, which emphasizes the need to protect PII. The mandatory
     requirement to collect SSNs has been deleted. Executive Orders 9397 (SSN), as amended
AFI33-332_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 26 JULY 2011                                                 17


     shall be referenced when cited in PAS, PIA and SORN whenever SSN is collected, used,
     stored, or disseminated for acceptable uses within AF IT systems, on AF Forms, or in
     other physical media systems of records. IT systems, AF Forms, and AF records OPRs
     should also consult DTM-07-015-USD (P&R), paragraph 2, Acceptable Uses. Contact the
     OPR‟s organizational Privacy Office for assistance.
     2.3.5.2. Protection of SSN. SSNs are personal and unique to each individual. The SSN in
     any form, including, but not limited to truncated, masked, partially masked, encrypted, or
     disguised SSN will be Protected as High Impact PII and marked FOR OFFICIAL USE
     ONLY (FOUO). Within DoD do not disclose another person‟s SSN without an official
     need to know. Outside DoD SSNs are not releasable without the person‟s consent or
     unless authorized under one of the twelve exceptions to the Privacy Act (see paragraph
     10.4).
  2.3.6. Reporting Results of Social Security Number Reduction.
     2.3.6.1. New Departmental Forms. AF Departmental Forms Management Officer shall
     maintain a database to produce an annual report every July 1st. This report shall be an
     input into the Privacy section of the annual FISMA Report as required by subchapter III,
     chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code. The annual report shall contain the following
     elements:
         2.3.6.1.1. Number of forms reviewed.
         2.3.6.1.2. Number of forms requesting SSNs.
         2.3.6.1.3. Number of SSN justifications accepted and rejected.
         2.3.6.1.4. Examples of forms where SSNs were not allowed.
         2.3.6.1.5. Examples of SSN masking or truncation.
     2.3.6.2. For new forms issued below departmental level (HAF/MAJCOM/FOA/DRU,
     Wing, etc), no database shall be required as set forth in paragraph 2.3.6.1., above, w ith
     the exception of annual reporting to the AF Departmental Forms Management Officer
     each July 1st with respect to information as to those forms in which SSNs were proposed
     to be collected but was determined not to be necessary.
     2.3.6.3. Existing Departmental Forms. AF Departmental Forms Management Officer
     shall report annually on July 1st the results of AF Forms reviews and submit via report to
     the AF Privacy Officer for input into the Privacy section of the Annual FISMA Report.
     This report shall include the following elements:
         2.3.6.3.1. Total number of forms in the database.
         2.3.6.3.2. Number of forms reviewed.
         2.3.6.3.3. Number of forms containing SSNs.
         2.3.6.3.4. Number of forms where justifications were questioned.
         2.3.6.3.5. Number of SSN justifications accepted and rejected.
         2.3.6.3.6. Examples of forms where SSNs were not allowed.

     2.3.6.4. For       existing    forms      issued    below        departmental      level
     (HAF/MAJCOM/FOA/DRU, Wing, etc.), no reports are req uired at the command and
     installation levels, with the exception of sharing best practices of specific examples
     where SSNs were eliminated or better masked, or unless for metrics collection at the AF
     level.

                                            Chapter 3

        GIVING FIRST PARTY ACCESS TO THEIR PRIVACY ACT RECORDS

3.1. Making a Request for Access. For a non-official request for their Privacy Act record(s),
first party requesters or their designated representatives shall submit a signed written request for
a copy of their records. Requesters need not state why they want access to their records. Verify
the identity of the requester to avoid unauthorized disclosures. How you verify identity will
depend on the sensitivity of the requested records. Identity can be verified in a number of ways,
to include visually, personal knowledge of the requester, a signed letter or request via telephone
or email, a notarized statement, or an unsworn statement. An unsworn declaration or notarized
statement should be obtained in the following format:
   3.1.1. “I declare under penalty of perjury (if outside the United States, add “under the laws
   of the United States of America”) that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date)
   (Signature).”
3.2. Processing a Request for Access. Immediately consult the local Privacy Act Officer to
assure timely response to the request. Consider a request from an individual for his or her own
records in a system of records under both the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the
Privacy Act regardless of the Act cited. The reque ster does not need to cite either Act if the
records requested are contained in a system of records. Process the request under whichever Act
gives the most information. When necessary, tell the requester which Act was used and why.
   3.2.1. Requesters must adequately describe the records they want. They do not have to name
   a system of records number, but they should at least name a type of record or functional area.
   For requests that ask for “all records about me,” ask for more information and tell the perso n
   how to review the government-wide systems of records published in the Federal Register or
   at http://privacy.defense.gov/notices/.
   3.2.2. Requesters will not use government equipment, supplies, stationery, postage,
   telephones, or official mail channels for making non-official requests for Privacy Act
   records. However, system managers may process such requests and tell requesters that using
   government resources to make non-official requests for Privacy Act records is not
   authorized.
   3.2.3. Response to all Privacy Act requests shall be made within 20 workdays of receipt. The
   requester will be informed of the status of their request after 10 workdays have elapsed,
   informing them of the status of their request and providing an approximate completion date
   of no more than 20 workdays from the date of initial receipt of the request.
   3.2.4. Show or give a copy of the record to the requester within 10 workdays of receiving the
   request unless the system has an exemption published in the Federal Register as a final rule.
   Give information in a form the requester can understand. If the system is exempt from
   disclosure under the Privacy Act, follow the procedures addressed in paragraph 3.5
3.3. Fees. Provide the first 100 pages free, and charge only reproduction costs for the
remainder. Copies cost $.15 per page; microfiche costs $.25 per fiche. Charge fees for all pages
of subsequent requests when copies of the same records.
 20                               AFI33-332_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 26 JULY 2011


3.3. (MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Fees. Coordinate the DD Form 1131, Cash Collection
Voucher, and monies collected through 366 CS/SCOKR prior to submission to accounts
receivable. Make checks or money orders for the exact amount payable to "FSO Mountain
Home AFB ID, DSSN 3801." Contact 366 CS/SCOKR for a sample of DD Form 1131.
3.4. Do not charge fees:
   3.4.1. For official purposes, such as to respond to the proposed denial of a right, privilege, or
   benefit; disciplinary action; or if the requestor can get the record without charge under
   procedures governed by DoD or AF regulation applicable to the record (for example medical
   records).
   3.4.2. For search.
   3.4.3. For reproducing a document for the convenience of the Air Force.
   3.4.4. For reproducing a record so the requester can review it.
   3.4.5. Fee waivers. Waive fees automatically if the direct cost of reproduction is less than
   $15, unless the individual is seeking an obvious extension or duplication of a previous
   request for which he or she was granted a waiver. Decisions to waive or reduce fees that
   exceed $15 are made on a case-by-case basis.
3.5. Denying or Limiting Access. When a Privacy Act record will not be released under the
Privacy Act, the request must be processed under the FOIA. If any part of the record is de nied
under the FOIA, the procedures in DoD Regulation 5400.7/AFMAN 33-302 are followed. For
Privacy Act denials not processed under the FOIA, send a copy of the request, the record copy,
and why you recommend denying access (include the applicable exemption) to the denial
authority through the legal office and the Privacy Act office. Judge Advocate (JA) offices will
include a written legal opinion. The legal opinion will not merely state that the decision is
“legally sufficient,” but will provide factual details and an analysis of the law and applicable
regulations. The Privacy Act officer reviews the file, and makes a recommendation to the denial
authority. The denial authority sends the requester a letter with the decision. If the denial
authority grants access, release the record copy. If the denial authority refuses access, tell the
requester why and explain pertinent appeal rights (see Chapter 5).
   3.5.1. Before you deny a request for access to a record, make sure that:
       3.5.1.1. The system has an exemption published in the Federal Register as a final rule.
       3.5.1.2. The exemption covers each document. All parts of a system are not
       automatically exempt.
       3.5.1.3. The FOIA does not require release of any part of the record.
       3.5.1.4. Nonexempt parts are segregated.
   3.5.2. Third Party Information in a Privacy Act System of Record. A first party requester is
   not entitled to information that is not “about” him or her that is contained in their Privacy Act
   record; for example, the home address or SSN of a third party. Servicing legal offices should
   be consulted prior to the release of a third party‟s sensitive personal information to a first
   party requester that is contained in the first party requester‟s Privacy Act record.
3.6. Denial Authorities.
AFI33-332_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 26 JULY 2011                                                 21


  3.6.1. Initial Denial Authority (IDA). An official who has been granted authority by the head
  of a DoD component to withhold records requested under the FOIA for one or more of the
  nine categories of records exempt from mandatory disclosure. See DoD 5400.7-R/AFMAN
  33-302, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program. IDA‟s may also deny a fee category
  claim by a requester; deny a request for expedited processing due to demonstrated
  compelling need in accordance with DoD Regulation 5400.7/AFMAN 33-302; deny a
  request for a waiver or reduction of fees; review a fee estimate; and confirm that no records
  were located in response to a request.
  3.6.2. Only approved IDAs will deny all or parts of records. However, if the only
  information withheld from an Air Force record is privacy information under the DoD policy
  to withhold lists of names of DoD personnel (“DoD Names Policy”), the organization/unit
  FOIA monitors may sign the decision memorandum and FOIA managers may release on
  their behalf. FOIA managers may: initially deny fee category claims, requests for expedited
  processing, and waiver or reduction of fees; review fee estimates; and sign “no records”
  responses. IDAs are the deputy chiefs of staff and chiefs of comparable offices or higher at
  HQ USAF and Secretary of the Air Force (SAF) and MAJCOM commanders. MAJCOM
  commanders may appoint two additional positions at the headquarters and also the wing
  commander at base level. MAJCOM inspector general‟s (IGs) and MAJCOM Directors of
  Inquiries (IGQ) may act as IDAs for IG records. MAJCOM FOIA managers must notify
  SAF/A6PP in writing (by facsimile, e- mail, or regular mail) of IDA position titles. Send
  position titles only--no names. SAF/A6PP provides SAF/IGQ a courtesy copy of
  correspondence designating IDA positions for IG records. When the commander changes the
  IDA designee position, MAJCOM FOIA managers advise SAF/A6PP immediately. In the
  absence of the designated IDA, the individual filling/assuming that position acts as an IDA,
  however; all denial documentation must reflect the position title of the approved or
  designated IDA, even if in an acting capacity (i.e., Acting Director of Communications and
  Information, Headquarters Air Combat Command). Organizations are authorized to withhold
  DoD names below 0-7, and email addresses of most DoD personnel, under the DoD Names
  Policy.
  3.6.3. HAF two- letter/digit offices
  3.6.4. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU commanders
  3.6.5. Unified Commanders

                                             Chapter 4

                           AMENDING A PRIVACY ACT RECORD

4.1. Amendment Reasons. Individuals may ask to have their personal information in records
amended to make them accurate, timely, relevant, or complete. System managers will routinely
correct a record if the requester can show that it is factually wrong (e.g., date of birth is wrong).
4.2. Responding to Amendment Requests.
   4.2.1. The individual may request simple corrections orally. Requests for complicated and
   detailed corrections must be in writing to ensure clarity.
   4.2.2. After verifying the identity of the requester, make the change if appropriate, notify all
   known recipients of the record, and inform the individual.
   4.2.3. Acknowledge requests within 10 workdays of receipt. Give an expected completion
   date unless you complete the change within that time. Final decisions must, unless extended
   by the appropriate authority, take no longer than 30 workdays.
4.3. Approving or Denying a Record Amendme nt. The Air Force does not usually amend a
record when the change is based on opinion, interpretation, or subjective official judgment.
Determination not to amend such records constitutes a denial, and requesters may appeal (see
Chapter 5).
   4.3.1. If the system manager decides not to amend the record, send a copy of the request, the
   record, and the recommended denial reasons to the denial authority through the legal office
   and the Privacy Act office. Legal offices will include a written legal opinion. The legal
   opinion will not merely state that the decision is “legally sufficient,” but will provide factual
   details and an analysis of the law and applicable regulations. The Privacy Act officer reviews
   the proposed denial and legal opinion and makes a recommendation to the denial authority.
   4.3.2. The denial authority sends the requester a letter with the decision. If the denial
   authority approves the request the record is amended.
   4.3.3. The requester may file a concise statement of disagreement with the system of records
   manager if SAF/GCA denies the request to amend the record. SAF/GCA explains the
   requester‟s rights when they issue the final appeal decision. (see Privacy Act of 1974)
4.4. Contents of Privacy Act Processing Case Files. Do not keep copies of disputed records in
this file. File disputed records in their appropriate series. Use the file solely for statistics and to
process requests. Do not use the case files to make any kind of determination about an
individual. Document the reasons for untimely responses. These files include:
      4.4.1. Requests from and replies to individuals on whether a system has records about them.
   4.4.2. Requests for access or amendment.
   4.4.3. Approvals, denials, appeals, and final review actions.
   4.4.4. Coordination actions and related papers.
AFI33-332_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 26 JULY 2011                                                     23

                                              APPEALS

5.1. Appeal Procedures. Individuals who receive a denial to their access or amendment request
may request a denial review (appeal) within 60 calendar days of the date of the denial letter. (See
paragraph 3.6. Denial Authorities)
   5.1.1. The denial authority promptly sends a complete appeal package to SAF/GCA. The
   package must include:
       5.1.1.1. The original appeal letter;
       5.1.1.2. The initial request;
       5.1.1.3. The initial denial;
       5.1.1.4. A copy of the record;
       5.1.1.5. Any internal records or coordination actions relating to the denial; (6) the denial
       authority‟s comments on the appellant‟s arguments; and (7) the legal reviews.
   5.1.2. If the denial authority reverses an earlier denial and grants access or amendment,
   notify the requester immediately.
   5.1.3. The system manager may include a brief summary of the reasons for not amending the
   record. Limit the summary to the reasons SAF/GCA gave to the individual. The summary is
   part of the individual‟s record, but it is not subject to amendment procedures.
   5.1.4. AFLOA/JACL reviews the denial and provides a final recommendation to SAF/GCA.
   SAF/GCA provides the requester the final Air Force decision and explains judicial review
   rights.
   5.1.5. SAF/GCA will provide a copy of the decision letter to the HAF/MAJCOM/FOA/DRU
   Privacy Act Officer if applicable and the originating Privacy Act Officer to close the case
   file.
   5.1.6. The records will clearly show that a statement of disagreement is filed with the record
   or separately, if applicable.
   5.1.7. The disputed part of the record must show that the requester filed a statement of
   disagreement.
   5.1.8. Give copies of the statement of disagreement to the record‟s previous recipients.
   Inform subsequent record users about the dispute and give them a copy of the statement with
   the record.

                     DISCLOSING RECORDS TO THIRD PARTIES

6.1. Disclosure Considerations.
   6.1.1. Placing Personally Identifiable Information on Shared Drives. PII contained in any
   records shall not be placed on shared drives for access by groups of individuals unless each
   person of the group has an official need to know for an approved government purpose to
   perform their job. Add appropriate access controls to ensure access by only authorized
   individuals that have the need to know.
      6.1.1.1. Recall rosters will be marked FOUO and only provided to individuals with a
      need to know of the information in order to accomplish their official duties. Do not place
      a complete recall roster on a shared location with access allowed for everyone in a unit,
      unless necessary for official purposes.
   6.1.2. Placing PII Files in Collaborative IT Environments. AF ISOs of collaborative IT
   environments within the USAF enterprise, i.e., Microsoft SharePoint, Tracking Management
   Tool (TMT), Customer Relations Management (CRM), share drives, etc., will adhere to this
   Instruction and Records Management business rules established for particular categories of
   official records.
      6.1.2.1. The ISO will obtain written permission from the ISO of the parent system of
      records before placing electronic files or records copies into a collaborative or shared
      environment.
      6.1.2.2. The ISO will protect, safeguard and manage Privacy Act records and records
      containing PII within a shared environment according to the published SORN and/or PIA
      of the parent system of records from which electronic files and records copies are shared.
      AF SORNs are posted on the Defense Privacy Office public website
      http://privacy.defense.gov/notices/usaf. AF PIAs are posted on the Air Force Privacy
      Act public website http://www.privacy.af.mil/pia/index.asp
   6.1.3. Personal Information That Requires Protection. Following are some examples of
   information that is normally not releasable to the public without the written consent of the
   subject. This list is not all- inclusive. The facts and circumstances of the request and the
   nature of the record will determine releasability.
      6.1.3.1. Marital status (single, divorced, widowed, separated).
      6.1.3.2. Number, name, and sex of dependents.
      6.1.3.3. Civilian educational degrees and major areas of study (unless the request for the
      information relates to the professional qualifications for Federal employment).
      6.1.3.4. School and year of graduation (if in connection with professional qualifications
      for Federal employment).
      6.1.3.5. Home of record.
      6.1.3.6. Home address and phone.
      6.1.3.7. Age and date of birth (year).

       6.1.3.8. Present or future assignments for overseas or for routinely deployable or
       sensitive units.
       6.1.3.9. Office, name, state, unit address and duty phone for overseas or for routinely
       deployable or sensitive units.
       6.1.3.10. Race/ethnic origin.
       6.1.3.11. Educational level (unless the request for release of the information relates to the
       professional qualifications for Federal employment).
       6.1.3.12. Social Security Number.
6.2. Releasable Information. Following are examples of information normally releasable to
the public without the written consent of the subject. This list is not all- inclusive. Since 2001 the
release of names and other PII of certain DoD personnel are given more scrutiny and the interests
supporting     withholding     of    the     information      given      more      weight.        See

   6.2.21. Date of retirement, separation.
6.3. Disclosing Information. In all cases, use the following guidelines to decide whether to
release information:
   6.3.1. Would the subject have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the information
   requested?
   6.3.2. Is disclosing the information in the public interest? The public interest relates to how
   the Air Force carries out its statutory and regulatory duties.
   6.3.3. Balance the public interest against the individual‟s privacy interest. Do not consider
   the requester‟s purpose, circumstances, or proposed use.
6.4. Rules for Releasing Privacy Act Information Without Consent of the Subject. The
Privacy Act prohibits disclosing disclosure of any Privacy Act records without the written
consent of the individual to whom the record pertains. There are twelve exceptions to the “no
disclosure without consent” rule. http://www.privacy.af.mil/exceptions/index.asp
6.5. Disclosing the Medical Records of Minors. Air Force personnel may disclose the medical
records of minors to their parents or legal guardians in conjunction with applicable Federal laws
and guidelines. The laws of each state define the age of majority. Consult with the servicing legal
office and Military Treatment Facility (MTF) for guidance in regard to the age of majority in
overseas locations.
6.6. Disclosure Accountings. System managers must keep an accurate record of all disclosures
made from any system of records except disclosures to DoD personnel for official use or
disclosures under the FOIA. System managers may use AF Form 771, Accounting of
Disclosures. Retain disclosure accountings for 5 years after the disclosure, or for the life of the
record, whichever is longer.
   6.6.1. System managers shall file the Accounting of Disclosure record and give it to the
   subject on request, send corrected or disputed information to previous record recipients,
   explain any disclosures, and provide an audit trail for reviews. Include in each accounting:
         6.6.1.1. Release date.
         6.6.1.2. Description of information.
         6.6.1.3. Reason for release.
         6.6.1.4. Name and address of recipient.
      6.6.2. Some exempt systems let you withhold the accounting record from the subject.
   6.6.3. You may withhold information about disclosure accountings for law enforcement
   purposes at the law enforcement agency‟s request.
6.7. Computer Matching. Computer matching programs electronically compare records from
two or more automated systems that may include DoD, another Federal agency, state or other
local government. A system manager proposing a match that could result in an adverse action
against a Federal employee must meet these requirements of the Privacy Act: (1) prepare a
written agreement between participants; (2) secure approval of the Defense Data Integrity Board;
(3) publish a matching notice in the Federal Register before matching begins; (4) ensure full
investigation and due process; and (5) act on the information, as necessary.
AFI33-332_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 26 JULY 2011                                                   27


   6.7.1. The Privacy Act applies to matching programs that use records from: Federal
   personnel or payroll systems and Federal benefit programs where matching: (1) determines
   Federal benefit eligibility; (2) checks on compliance with benefit program requirements; (3)
   recovers improper payments or delinquent debts from current or former beneficiaries.
   6.7.2. Matches used for statistics, pilot programs, law enforcement, tax administration,
   routine administration, background checks and foreign counterintelligence, and internal
   matching that won't cause any adverse action are exempt from Privacy Act matching
   requirements.
   6.7.3. Any activity that expects to participate in a matching program must contact
   SAF/A6PPF immediately. System managers must prepare a notice for publication in the
   Federal Register with a Routine Use that allows disclosing the proposed system notice to
   SAF/A6PPF. Allow 180 days for processing requests for a new matching program.
   6.7.4. The subjects of a Privacy Act record must receive a PAS when personal information
   the subjects are asked to provide will be used in a matching program as a routine use. The
   most appropriate method of doing so is to include the PAS on the form used to apply for
   benefits. Coordinate appropriate statements with the appropriate HAF/MAJCOM/FOA/DRU
   Privacy Officer and SAF/A6P.
6.8. Privacy and the Web. Do not post PII on publicly accessible DoD web sites unless
authorized by law and implementing regulation and policy. Additionally, do not post PII on .mil
private web sites unless authorized by the local commander, for official purposes, and an
appropriate risk assessment is performed. See AFI 33-129 Transmission of Information Via the
Internet.
   6.8.1. Add a prominent Privacy Act Advisory at web site entry points. A Privacy Act
   Advisory is required to be posted on the web page where the information is being solicited or
   through a well- marked hyperlink whenever a web site solicits PII, even when not retained by
   the site after login or maintained in a Privacy Act system of records. Notices must clear ly
   explain when the collection of PII is voluntary and notify users how to provide consent.
   6.8.2. Include a Privacy Act Statement on the web page if it collects information directly
   from an individual that is maintained and retrieved by his or her name o r personal identifier
   (i.e., SSN). Only maintain such information in approved Privacy Act systems of records that
   are published in the Federal Register. The Privacy Act gives subject individual‟s certain
   rights with respect to the government‟s maintenance and use of PII collected about them that
   is contained in a Privacy Act record. Provide a link to the Air Force Privacy Act policy and
   SORNs                     at                http://www.privacy.af.mil/                    and

                                            Chapter 7

                             PRIVACY IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

7.1. Evaluating Information Systems for Privacy Act Compliance and Risk
Identification. ISOs, PMs, and IAMs will address Privacy Act requirements and risks to
Privacy Act data and plan the integration of privacy protections with appropriate IA controls into
the development life cycle of an information system. A PIA will be completed in accordance
with DoDI 5400.16, DoD Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) Guidance, February 12, 2009.
7.2. What is a PIA? The Privacy Impact Assessment is an analysis of how PII information
is handled: (1) to ensure PII handling conforms to applicable legal, regulatory, and policy
requirements regarding privacy, (2) to determine the risks and effects of collecting, maintaining
and disseminating information in identifiable form in an electronic information system, and (3)
to examine and evaluate protections and alternative processes for handling PII information to
mitigate potential privacy risks.
   7.2.1. The PIA identifies the physical, technical, and administrative controls that are needed
   to protect PII. Information Assurance (IA) controls are identified in DoDI 8500.2,
   Information Assurance (IA) Implementation, 6 Feb 03 that mitigate specific risks that will be
   implemented and tested before deployment or release of the system; and whether a SORN
   exists, needs to be created, and/or needs to be amended. The E-Government Act of 2002 and
   DoDI 5400.16 requires PIAs to be conducted before:
       7.2.1.1. Developing or procuring IT systems or projects that collect, maintain, or
       disseminate information in identifiable form from or about individuals as defined in DoD
       5400.11-R
       7.2.1.2. PIAs are required to be performed, accomplished and/or updated as necessary
       when a system change exposes a new privacy risk for which an IA control must be
       identified and tested before re-deployment or re-release of the system.
       7.2.1.3. The depth and content of the PIA should be thorough and appropriate for the
       nature of the information to be collected and the size and complexity of the information
       technology system.
7.3. When a PIA is required. PIAs are submitted 120 days from the scheduled operational and
expiration date on all new and existing systems meeting the criteria when PII is collected,
maintained, used, or disseminated in electronic form about members of the public, Federal
personnel, contractors or foreign nationals employed at U.S. military facilities internationally, in
order to:
   7.3.1. Ensure PII handling conforms to applicable legal, regulatory, and policy requirements
   regarding privacy;
   7.3.2. Determine the need, privacy risks, and effects of collecting, maintaining, using, and
   disseminating PII in electronic form; and
   7.3.3. Examine and evaluate protections and alternative processes to mitigate potential
   privacy risks.
AFI33-332_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 26 JULY 2011                                                       29


7.4. When a PIA is not required. A PIA is not required when: (1) PII is not being maintained,
collected, store, used, and/or disseminated other than the user table or (2) the system is an
approved National Security System (NSS). Administrative and personnel systems that do not
meet one or more of the NSS conditions are not exempt from the PIA requirement.
7.5. Who conducts the PIA? The ISO will conduct a PIA in conjunction with the system
PM, system IAM and local/functional Privacy Official.
   7.5.1. Medical IT systems that are Defense Health Program (DHP) funded or in the AF line-
   funded portfolio and managed by AFMS assets, shall route PIAs through the AF SG-CIO
   office for appropriate management, signatures, and oversight.
   7.5.2. All DoD Medical Department IT systems purchased with DHP funds must ONLY be
   reported to the DoD Information Technology Portfolio Repository (DITPR) via the
   component Tricare Management Activity (TMA).
7.6. Format and Digital Signatures. All PIAs shall be completed on DD Form 2930 as an
unsecured fillable PDF which requires digital signatures as follows, except for medical DHP
funded systems (see paragraph 7.5.1):
   7.6.1. Obtain the first three signatures before email submission to SAF/A6PPF
   AirForcePrivacy@pentagon.af.mil for review by SAF/A6 and digital signatures in the final
   three blocks.
   7.6.2. The system Program Manager
   7.6.3. The system Information Assurance Manager
   7.6.4. The HAF/MAJCOM/FOA/DRU Privacy Official
   7.6.5. The Senior Information Assurance Official (SIAO) or designee
   7.6.6. The Senior Agency (AF) Privacy Official (SAOP) or designee
   7.6.7. The AF CIO as final reviewer
7.7. Submitting Approved PIAs. Approved PIAs on IT systems that collect PII on members of
the General Public will be further submitted to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Chief
Information Officer (OSD NII/CIO) as they are required for submission to OMB; otherwise
submission is required only to AF. All approved and signed PIAs will be redacted in Sections 3
and 4 of information which shall not be posted, i.e., vulnerabilities and risk mitigations,
classified, sensitive, and non-releasable or PII contained in an assessment. It is then posted on the
AF Privacy Act public access website http://www.privacy.af.mil/pia/index.asp and email
notification sent to the originator.

                                            Chapter 8

 PREPARING SYSTEM OF RECORDS NOTICE (SORN) FOR PUBLISHING IN THE
                       FEDERAL REGISTER

8.1. Publis hing System of Records Notices (SORNs). Records that are retrieved by name or
personal identifier are subject to Privacy Act requirements and are re ferred to as Privacy Act
Systems of Records. The Air Force must publish SORNs in the Federal Register, describing the
collection (noun) of information for new, changed or deleted systems to inform the public and
allow a 30 day opportunity for public comment. During this 30 day review period, the system
owner shall not collect, store, use, or disseminate the information to be used. System owners can
begin collecting, storing, using, and disseminating PII on the Federal Register published
effective date unless comments are received that would result in a contrary determination.
8.2. When is a SORN required? A SORN is require d for system of records that are
retrieved by name or personal identifier. The Privacy Act requires submission of new or
significantly changed SORNs to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and both houses
of Congress before publication in the Federal Register. This applies when:
      8.2.1. Starting a new system. (Add)
   8.2.2. Instituting significant changes to an existing system. (Alter or Amend)
   8.2.3. Sending out data collection forms or Instructions.
   8.2.4. Issuing a request for proposal or invitation for bid to support a new system.
   8.2.5. Other Systems. National Security Privacy Act Systems of Records require that a
   SORN be completed, as with any other SORN. While some or many of these systems may be
   classified, the SORN is written in an unclassified manner describing the nature of the
   collection of PII. (See DoD 5400.11-R, for the use and establishment of exemptions that may
   apply to these systems).
8.3. Adopting Existing SORNs. A new system of records may “piggy back” onto an existing
published SORN:
   8.3.1. First, research current SORNs, including those that cover systems of records
   government-wide and DoD-wide on the Defense Privacy Notices website
   http://privacy.defense.gov/notices/osd and the Air Force Privacy Notices website
   http://privacy.defense.gov/notices/usaf for one that matches well with the new system of
   records at all points, i.e., Category of Individuals Covered, Category of Records, Authority,
   Purposes, Routine Uses, Policies, etc.
   8.3.2. Second, if necessary, contact the current SORN owner through the POC information
   on the SORN to discuss altering or amending their SORN to include the new system of
   records and POC information.
   8.3.3. Provide the system owner the altered or amended SORN for their review and
   processing.
8.4. Updating SORNs. Examples for Adding, Altering, Amending, and Deleting a SORN are
available   on   the   FOIA/Privacy     Act     Community     of    Practice   (COP)
AFI33-332_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 26 JULY 2011                                              31


https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/vie ws/home.aspx?Filte r=OO-SC-AF-53 listed under
Privacy Act Procedures, System of Records Notifications. Use Microsoft Word and the Track
Changes tool in MS Word to indicate additions and changes to existing notices.
8.5. Submitting SORNs for Publication in the Federal Register. The PM must submit the
proposed SORN through the local and HAF/MAJCOM/FOA/DRU Privacy Office a minimum of
120 days before the planned implementation date of a new system of records or a change to an
existing system of records subject to this Instruction. The HAF/MAJCOM/FOA/DRU Privacy
Office will review for accuracy and completeness and send electronically to the AF Privacy
Office AirForcePrivacy@pentagon.af.mil . The AF Privacy Office will review and forward to
the Defense Privacy Office for publishing in the Federal Register, as appropriate.
8.6. Requirement for Periodic Review of Published SORNs. System PMs will annually
review to validate currency of their published SORNs coinciding with annual FISMA reviews
and submit any changes through the process described in this chapter and promptly update
appropriate answers to EITDR questions.
8.7. Deletion of SORNs. If your records system is decommissioned or closed and has a
published SORN, comply with DoD 5400.11-R, “Deletion of System of Records Notices” and
submit appropriate amendment or deletion through the AF Privacy Office
AirForcePrivacy@pentagon.af.mil to be forwarded to Defense Privacy Office for publishing in
the Federal Register.

9.3. PII Breach Reporting. Refer to OSD Memorandum, Safeguarding Against and
Responding to the Breach of Personally Identifiable Information, 05 Jun 09, Appendix A, Table
1, PII Incident Reporting and Risk Assessment Model. A PII breach is defined as “a loss of
control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, unauthorized access, or
any similar term referring to situations where persons other than authorized users and for an
other than authorized purpose have access or potential access to PII, whether physical or
electronic.” (see Attachment 1, Terms). Breaches must be reported to the installation Privacy
Official by anyone discovering it.
       9.3.1. The installation Privacy Official will submit a Preliminary PII Incident Report by
       unencrypted email according to the timeline below:
          9.3.1.1. PII Incident Reports must be completed in the format provided by the
          Defense Privacy Office located on the Air Force Privacy COP:

          9.3.1.2. Use for Preliminary and Final reports.
          9.3.1.3. Use Red color font for changes made.
          9.3.1.4. Reports must include names of individuals involved or affected by the
          breach. Reports are forwarded by unencrypted email through the appropriate
          HAF/MAJCOM/FOA/DRU Privacy Office to AirForcePrivacy@pentagon.af.mil.
          9.3.1.5. Within one hour of the discovery of the PII breach the installation Privacy
          Official will ensure the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US
          CERT) has been notified in accordance with the requirements and guidance at
          www.us-cert.gov
          9.3.1.6. Within 24 hours of the PII breach the installation Privacy Official will notify
          the senior- level individual in the chain of command of the unit where the incident
          occurred and simultaneously notify the HAF/MAJCOM/FOA/DRU Privacy Officer
          by official unencrypted email attaching the written PII Incident Preliminary Report.
          9.3.1.7. Within 24 hours of being notified of the PII breach the
          HAF/MAJCOM/FOA/DRU Privacy Official (as appropriate) will notify the Air Force
          Privacy Office by official unencrypted email attaching the written PII Incident
          Preliminary Report.
          9.3.1.8. Within 48 hours of the PII breach notification the AF Privacy Act Officer
          will forward the report to the DoD Privacy Official and concurrently notify the Senior
          Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP).
          9.3.1.9. Resolving the PII Incident. The underlying breach that led to the breach shall
          continue to be reported to the AF Privacy Office in accordance with these reporting
          procedures until resolved. However, corrective actions will be taken immediately to
          provide required protection of PII.
          9.3.1.10. The installation Privacy Official will send the PII Incident Final Report
          when resolved in the same routing as previous notifications.
AFI33-332_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 26 JULY 2011                                                  35


     9.3.2. Guidelines for conducting an inquiry of a PII Incident. The senior- level individual
     who is in the chain of command for the organization where the loss, theft or compromise
     occurred will appoint another official to conduct an inquiry on the PII incident to
     determine the cause of the breach and if a criminal investigation is warranted.
        9.3.2.1. The installation Privacy Official will provide the guidance to the individ ual
        appointed to properly complete the PII Incident Final Report and reference AF and
        DoD Policies and the Privacy Act for use in completing the investigation as required.
        9.3.2.2. The appointed official will review the initial PII Incident Preliminary Report
        and independently assess the handling of the breach. They will make clarifications
        and additions on the PII Incident Final Report as required, and submit to the
        appointing senior- level individual a recommendation of whether notification to
        affected individuals is required after a risk assessment analysis has been completed
        along with any corrective actions that should be taken. A legal review may be
        requested before submission of the Final Report to determine whether administrative,
        disciplinary action or a criminal investigation is warranted and appropriate. The
        appointed official may be asked by the appointing senior- level individual to make
        additional recommendations or more formal reports as required.
        9.3.2.3. Upon concurrence with PII Incident Final Report recommendations, the
        senior- level individual who is in the chain of command for the organization where the
        loss, theft or compromise occurred will route the Final report to the appropriate
        Privacy Office.
     9.3.3. Air Force Computer Emergency Response Team (AFCERT) Reported PII
     Incidents. According to CJCSM 6510.01A, Enclosure C, Paragraph 7.b, “when a
     Computer Network Defense Service Provider (CNDSP) discovers compromised or
     potentially compromised PII, they must notify the US CERT and their Service Privacy
     Office POC.”
        9.3.3.1. AFCERT will follow through on CNDSP detections of PII Incidents by
        notifying the ISO and PM of the web application and/or IT system cited.
        9.3.3.2. ISO and PM of web application and/or IT system responsible for the PII
        breach must notify the installation Privacy Official or HAF/MAJCOM/FOA/DRU
        Privacy Official who will accomplish PII Breach notifications as established by this
        AF policy and DoD reporting guidance. (See paragraph 9.3) AF Privacy Officials are
        located throughout the Air Force to respond routinely to PII Incidents and provide
        assistance to commanders and organizations with PII Incident reporting and
        notifications.
        9.3.3.3. Notification to affected individuals, if determined to be required, will be
        made no later than 10 working days after a PII breach is discovered and the identities
        of the affected individuals ascertained by a senior level individual in the chain of
        command for the organization where the breach occurred. A senior- level official is
        considered to be at a Directorate or higher level. Military Group or higher level
        commanders of the O-6 rank or above also meet the definition of “senior level.” (See
        Attachment 7, Privacy Breach Notification Letter)
 36                                AFI33-332_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 26 JULY 2011


9.4. Risk Based Management. Apply a risk based management approach. Evaluate the
effectiveness of additional protections against sensitivity, probability of exposure, risk and cost.
   9.4.1. Consider the sensitivity category (Low, Moderate or High) of the PII and the
   probability of exposure, risk of disclosure, loss or alteration when providing physical security
   measures. (See Attachment 5, Risk Notification.)
   9.4.2. Information marked For Official Use Only (FOUO) or Controlled Unclassified
   Information (CUI) must be protected from unauthorized disclosure. Reasonable steps shall
   be taken both during and after working hours to minimize risk of access by unauthorized
   personnel. DoD 5200.1-R, Appendix 3 addresses the protection of CUI and AFI 31-401
   addresses FOUO.
   9.4.3. AF Form 3227 or DD Form 2923, Privacy Act Cover Sheet. Use is mandatory with
   Privacy Act materials when removed from their system of record or when not within their
   protected workplace. Use it to cover and protect PII contained in other records at all times
   from casual viewing in office environments and other areas that are accessible to many
   individuals who may not have a need to know the PII in the performance of their duties.
   9.4.4. AFVA 33-276. Privacy Act Label. Use is mandatory to assist in identifying and
   protecting Privacy Act information by placing the label on the covers of removable electronic
   storage media such as Laptops, Government Hard drives, DVDs, CDs, diskettes, and tapes.
   The label is not authorized for use on file drawers or file folders, cabinets, mobile electronic
   devices, or other stationary equipment or materials.
9.5. Disposing of Records. Consult a Records Professional before disposing of any records.
You may use the following methods to dispose of records protected by the Privacy Act for
authorized destruction according to RDS maintained in the Air Force Records Information
Management System (AFRIMS).
   9.5.1. Destroy by any reasonable method that prevents loss, theft or compromise during and
   after destruction such as pulping, macerating, tearing, burning, shredding or otherwise
   completely destroying the media so that PII is both not readable and is beyond
   reconstruction. The shreds or particles cannot be read. The shreds or particles cannot be
   reconstructed. Refer to NIST SP800-88. http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-
   88/NISTSP800-88_rev1.pdf
   9.5.2. Degauss or overwrite magnetic media according to established guidelines. DoD 5200-
   1 and AFI 31-401 also govern destruction of FOUO and CUI.
   9.5.3. Recycling of material protected under the Privacy Act.
       9.5.3.1. When safeguarding information protected under the Privacy Act can be assured
       as described in this chapter, disposal of recyclable Privacy Act protected products may be
       accomplished through the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO) or
       through contracted recycling providers that manage a base-wide recycling program.
       9.5.3.2. Originators of material protected under the Privacy Act must safeguard it until it
       is transferred to the recycling provider. This transfer does not require a disclosure
       accounting.
AFI33-332_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 26 JULY 2011                                                    37


                                          Chapter 10

                              PRIVACY ACT EXEMPTIONS

10.1. Exemption Types. This chapter contains the most current exemptions that have been
published as final rules for the listed systems of records as of the date of this AFI. The ISO
should ensure that a more recent final rule has not been published. There are two types of
exemptions from release or disclosure permitted by Title 5 USC 552a:
   10.1.1. A General exemption authorizes the exemption of a system of records from most
   parts of the Privacy Act.
   10.1.2. A Specific exemption authorizes the exemption of a system of records from only a
   few parts of the Privacy Act.
10.2. Authorizing Exemptions. Denial authorities may withhold release or disclosure of
records to the first party requesters using Privacy Act exemptions only when an exemption for
the system of records has been published in the Federal Register as a final rule. See
http://privacy.defense.gov/notices/usaf; exemptions are noted in the right column.
10.3. Requesting an Exe mption. An ISO who believes that a system requires an exemption
from some or all of the requirements of the Privacy Act will send a request through the Wing
Privacy Office, the HAF/MAJCOM/FOA/DRU or FOA Privacy Office, to AF Privacy Office,
SAF/A6PPF. Final approval is by the DoD Privacy Officer. The request will detail the reasons
why the exemption applies, the section of the Act tha t allows the exemption, and the specific
subsections of the Privacy Act from which the system is to be exempted, with justification for
each subsection.
10.4. Exemptions. Exemptions       permissible      under     title    5     are    located     at
http://uscode.house.gov/search/crite ria.shtml:
   10.4.1. The (j) (2) exemption. Applies to investigative records created and maintained by
   law-enforcement activities whose principal function is criminal law enforcement.
   10.4.2. The (k) (1) exemption. Applies to information specifically authorized to be classified
   according to DoD 5200.1R, Information Security Program.
   10.4.3. The (k) (2) exemption. Applies to investigatory information compiled for law-
   enforcement purposes by non- law enforcement activities and which is not within the scope of
   the (j) (2) exemption. However, the Air Force must allow an individual access to any record
   that is used to deny rights, privileges or benefits to which he or she would otherwise be
   entitled by Federal law or for which he or she would otherwise be eligible as a result of the
   maintenance of the information (unless doing so would reveal a confidential source).
   10.4.4. The (k) (3) exemption. Applies to records maintained in connection with providing
   protective services to the President and other individuals under Title 18; Crimes and Criminal
   Procedure, USC, section 3056; Powers, authorities, and duties of United States Secret
   Service.
   10.4.5. The (k) (4) exemption. Applies to records maintained solely for statistical research or
   program evaluation purposes and which are not used to make decisions on the rights,
   benefits, or entitlement of an individual except for census records which may be disclosed
38                                 AFI33-332_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 26 JULY 2011


  under Title 13, CENSUS, U.S.C., Section 8; Authenticated transcripts or copies of certain
  returns; other data; restriction on use; disposition of fees received.
  10.4.6. The (k) (5) exemption. Applies to investigatory material compiled solely for the
  purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for federal civilian
  employment, military service, federal contracts, or access to classified information, but only
  to the extent such material would reveal the identity of a confidential source. This provision
  allows protection of confidential sources used in background investigations, employment
  inquiries, and similar inquiries that are for personnel screening to determine suitability,
  eligibility, or qualifications.
     10.4.7. The (k) (6) exemption. Applies to testing or examination material used solely to
     determine individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the federal or military
     service, if the disclosure would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the test or
     examination process.
     10.4.8. The (k) (7) exemption. Applies to evaluation material used to determine potential for
     promotion in the Military Services, but only to the extent that the disclosure of such material
     would reveal the identity of a confidential source.
AFI33-332_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 26 JULY 2011                                                       39

Terms
Access—Allowing individuals to review or receive copies of government records that contain
personally identifiable information about them.
Amendment—The process of adding, deleting, or changing information in a system of records
to make the data accurate, relevant, timely, or complete.
Alte ration—A significant increase or change in the number or type of individuals about whom
records are maintained. Increases in numbers of individuals due to normal growth are not
considered alterations unless they truly alter the character and purpose of the system. Increases
that change significantly the scope of population covered (for example, expansion of a syste m of
records covering a single command‟s enlisted personnel to include all of the Component‟s
enlisted personnel would be considered an alteration). A reduction in the number of individuals
covered is not an alteration, but only an amendment. All changes that add new categories of
individuals to system coverage require a change to the “Categories of individuals covered by the
system” caption of the notice and may require changes to the “Purpose(s)” caption.
Breach—A loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition,
unauthorized access, or any similar term referring to situations where persons other than
authorized users and for an other than authorized purpose have access or potential access to PII,
whether physical or electronic.
Computer Matching—A computerized comparison of two or more automated systems of
records or a system of records with non-Federal records to establish or verify eligibility for
payments under Federal benefit programs or to recover delinquent debts for these programs.
Confidentiality—An expressed and recorded promise to withhold the identity of a source or the
information provided by a source.
AFI33-332_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 26 JULY 2011                                                     45


Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)—Types of information that require application of
controls and protective measures for a variety of reasons. This information is also known as
"unclassified controlled information."
Cookie—Data created by a Web server that is stored on a user's computer either temporarily for
that session only or permanently on the hard disk (persistent cookie). It provides a way for the
Web site to identify users and keep track of their preferences. It is commonly used to "maintain
the state" of the session. A third-party cookie either originates on or is sent to a Web site
different from the one you are currently viewing.
Defense Data Integrity Board—Composed of representatives from DoD components and the
services who oversee, coordinate, and approve all DoD computer matching programs covered by
the Act.
Denial Authority—The individuals with authority to deny requests for access or amendment of
records under the Privacy Act.

                                     RISK ASSESSMENT

A5.1. Risk Notification. Five factors are used when determining if an agency is required to
notify those who may have been affected by a PII breach. Agencies should take the time to
determine the risk of harm surrounding the breach. The factors used in assessing the likely risk
of harm are
A5.1.1. Nature of Data Elements Breached. Consider context of the data involved and the
potential harm that might be generated by its exposure to unauthorized individ uals.
   A5.1.2. Number of Individuals Affected. The magnitude of the number of individuals
   affected may determine how they will be notified, but should not impact an agency‟s
   decision to provide notification.
   A5.1.3. Likelihood the Information is Accessible and Useable. Upon discovery of a
   breach, agencies should assess the likelihood the personally identifiable information has been
   or will be used by unauthorized individuals. Increased risk the information will be used
   should influence an agency‟s decision to provide notification.
      A5.1.4. Likelihood the Breach May Lead to Harm.
         A5.1.4.1. Broad Reach of Potential Harm. Consider the possible harm associated with
         the loss or compromise of the PII, i.e., loss of self esteem, mental pain or emotional
         stress.
         A5.1.4.2. Likelihood Harm Will Occur. Agencies must determine the type of data has
         been compromised and the manner the breach occurred.
   A5.1.5. Ability of the Agencies to Mitigate the Risk of Harm. In addition to containing
   the breach, agencies must determine what countermeasures will be used to prevent further
   compromise of the system‟s PII.

              PREPARING A DOD SSN JUSTIFICATION MEMORANDUM

(Month, Day, Year)
MEMORANDUM THRU
FOR

SUBJECT: Justification for the Use of the Social Security Number (SSN)
         The memorandum should begin by naming and describing the system or form that is the
subject of the justification. The description is sufficiently detailed so that someone unfamiliar
with the system is should be able to grasp a general understanding of its intent.
         The justification for the use of the SSN must include a reference to the SSN Instruction
Use Case that is being used to justify the use of the SSN. If the justification does not fall under
either the operational necessity use case or the legacy system interface use case, then the
justification shall also include the specific reference to the law that requires the use of the SSN
and why it is applicable to the use being justified.
         Reference is made to the system or form supporting documentation, including but not
limited to, System of Records Notice (SORN), Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), Paperwork
Reduction Act (PRA) notice, or any other documentation that may be appropriate. If the
substance of the documentation is not attached, reference is made to how the reader may gain
access to this documentation.
         Justification for the use of the SSN does not constitute blanket permission to use the SSN.
Specific reference shall be made to indicate actions being taken to reduce the vulnerability of
SSNs, which may include indicating where SSNs are being removed from transactions, where
SSNs are no longer displayed, or any other protections that have been included. It should be
obvious to the reader that a thorough effort has been made to evaluate the risk associated with
the system or form and that every reasonable step has been or is being taken to reduce the use of
the SSN and protect it where the use is still required.
         If the justification for the use of the SSN falls under the “legacy use” authorization and is
not specifically required by the law, reference shall be made to the Plan of Actions and
Milestones for the elimination of the use of the SSN.

                EXAMPLE PRIVACY BREACH NOTIFICATION LETTER

                                  OFFICIAL LETTERHEAD

Dear Mr. John Miller:
On January 1, 2006, a DoD laptop computer was stolen from the parked car of a DoD employee
in Washington, D.C. after normal duty hours while the employee was running a personal errand.
The laptop contained personally identifying information on 100 DoD employees who were
participating in the xxx Program. The compromised information is the name, social security
number, residential address, date of birth, office and home email address, office, and home
telephone numbers of the Program participants.

The theft was immediately reported to local and DoD law enforcement authorities, who are now
conducting a joint inquiry into the loss.

We believe that the laptop was the target of the theft as opposed to any information that the
laptop might contain. Because the information in the laptop was password protected and
encrypted, we also believe that the probability is low that the information will be acquired and
used for an unlawful purpose. However, we cannot say with certainty that this might not occur.
We therefore believe that you should consider taking such actions to protect against the potential
that someone might use the information to steal your identity.

You should be guided by the actions recommended by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on
its Web site at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/ . The FTC urges that you to
immediately place an initial fraud alert on your credit file. The fraud alert is for a period of 90
days, during which, creditors are required to contact you before a new credit card is issued or an
existing card changed. The site also provides other valuable information that can be taken now
or in the future if problems should develop.

The Department of Defense takes this loss very seriously and is reviewing its current policies
and practices with a view of determining what must be changed to preclude a similar occurrence
in the future. At a minimum, we will be providing additional training to personnel to ensure that
they understand that personally identifiable information must at all times be treated in a manner
that preserves and protects the confidentiality of the data.

We deeply regret and apologize for any inconvenience and concern this theft may cause you.

Should you have any questions, please call ____________________.


                                            Sincerely,
                                         Signature Block
                                   (Directorate level or higher)
