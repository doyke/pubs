AF DCGS mission crews. This Instruction contains detailed procedures and criteria for planning
AF DCGS mission operations, provides a means to record policy and guidance and explains
documents used.
1.2. AF DCGS Mission Statement. AF DCGS, or GSQ-272 SENTINEL, weapon system is the
Air Force’s primary ISR, Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) system. AF DCGS
provides actionable, multi-discipline intelligence derived from multiple ISR platforms to
COCOMs, Component Numbered Air Forces (C-NAF) and national command authorities across
the globe, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week through distributed (reachback and deployed) and
collaborative operations. Active duty (AD), ANG, AFRC, joint and coalition units and
personnel work as an integrated combat capability, enabling the Air Force to engage in multiple,
simultaneous military operations across the globe.
1.3. Objectives. Specific AF DCGS program objectives are to:
   1.3.1. Establish AF DCGS mission crews.
   1.3.2. Ensure effective and efficient employment of AF DCGS mission crews.
   1.3.3. Establish AF DCGS mission planning activities.

its skilled personnel. Members who fail to attain or maintain directed levels of proficiency will
be re-evaluated IAW AFI 14-202 Volume 2, and as supplemented or suspended from operational
duty IAW AFMAN 36-2108, Airman Classification and AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military
Personnel Testing System, as appropriate.
     1.6.1. All personnel in the rank of Colonel or below and all civilians assigned to an AF
     DCGS weapon system billet and fulfilling intelligence functions at a AF DCGS unit will
     attain and maintain Basic Mission Capable (BMC) status in one or more mission positions
     unless designated in writing by the Wing/Center CCs as not requiring the maintenance of
     BMC status. Unit Commanders may employ DAF civilians and contractor personnel in
     appropriate AF DCGS mission crew positions. All AF DCGS personnel must be qualified as
     Combat Mission Ready (CMR) to operate an AF DCGS mission crew position executing a
     tasked mission. All AF DCGS crewmembers who directly participate in hostilities must be
     uniformed members on active duty status.

   manning waivers is the 480 ISRW Commander. Forward copies of all approved waivers
   through applicable command channels to AFISRA/A3. Waiver requests must include the
   following:
      4.4.1.1. Go/No-Go crew position.
      4.4.1.2. Justification for waiver.
      4.4.1.3. Unit plan of action to remedy the situation.
   4.4.2. Go/No-Go positions. Go/No-Go positions must be manned prior to launch of aircraft
   or mission start (for 24 hour mission operations) and must be manned throughout the
   mission.
4.5. Mission Duty Limitations, Crew Rest, and Fatigue Management. This section
prescribes mandatory crew rest and maximum Mission Duty Periods (MDP) for all personnel
who operate AF DCGS mission positions. Basic guidance for fatigue management strategies and
waiver authority procedures are also addressed.
   4.5.1. Waiver Authority. Procedures in this section may be waived by:
      4.5.1.1. AFISRA/A3 when an Operations Risk Management (ORM) assessment
      determines that mission requirements justify the increased risk. At AFISRA/A3
      discretion waiver authority for crew rest and MDP may be further delegated to no lower
      than the Group Commander (or equivalent). Waivers to crew rest and mission duty
      limitations may be published in AFISRA guidance or on a case by case basis.
      4.5.1.2. Maximum Mission Hours. Commanders and unit scheduling personnel will
      ensure crewmembers do not exceed a monthly mission hour limit.
          4.5.1.2.1. Units will establish a program to track mission hours for each assigned or
          attached crewmember to ensure that maximum monthly mission hours are not
          exceeded. Maximum steady state monthly mission hour limits are 149.6 hours per 30
          consecutive days.
          4.5.1.2.2. Mission Hours. Mission Hours are calculated as those hours within the
          MDP when a current and qualified crewmember is performing mission in an AF
          DCGS crew position and actively performing the duty associated with their crew
          specialty including pre- or post- mission duties, transcription time and off-line
          mission operations in support of time sensitive reporting. This time does not include
          meals, physical training and administrative duties.
          4.5.1.2.3. Monthly Mission Hour Waiver Requests. Unit Commanders will submit
          monthly hour waiver request either before mission hours are exceeded or as a matter
          of notification through command channels to the parent Wing Commander for review
          and approval. AFISRA-gained units without a parent Wing/Group will route waiver
          requests through appropriate channels for approval (e.g., NGB/A2, AFRC/A2, etc.).
          Forward a copy of all approved waivers through applicable command channels to
          AFISRA/A3 and the 480 ISRW/DOO. Waiver requests must include the following as

 Note: Units will not exceed max monthly mission hours for 33% or more of assigned
 crewmembers.


   4.5.3. Maximum Mission Duty Period (MDP). Maximum MDP is 12 hours for mission
   crewmembers. If official post-mission duties are anticipated to exceed 2 hours, commanders
   should consider reducing the MDP to ensure the safe completion of those duties.
         4.5.3.1. Crew Rest. Mission crew require at least 12 continuous hours of restful
         activities (including an opportunity for at least 8 hours of uninterrupted rest) during the
         12 hours immediately prior to the MDP. To ensure individual accountability and mission
         reliability, crewmembers should be officially notified prior to entering a crew rest period.
         A crew rest period cannot begin until after the completion of official duties. Exceptions
         to the 12-Hour Minimum Crew Rest Period for continuous operations when basic mission
         crews MDPs are greater than 12 but less than 14 hours, subsequent crew rest may be
         reduced proportionally to a minimum of 10 hours in order to maintain a 24-hour
         work/rest schedule, allowing opportunity for a minimum of eight (8) hours uninterrupted
         rest.
         4.5.3.2. Each mission crewmember is individually responsible to ensure that he or she
         obtains sufficient rest during crew rest periods. AF DCGS crewmembers will not
         consume alcohol at least 12 hours prior to mission start. Personnel shall not perform as a
         crewmember while under the influence of any over-the-counter or prescription
         medication that affects the crewmember’s ability to safely perform assigned duties.
         Member is to consult with Primary Care Manager (PCM) if medical conditions preclude
         him/her from safely performing assigned duties.
AFISRAI14-153V3 15 MARCH 2013                                                                      21


       4.5.3.3. MOC will determine if crew rest requirements were met IAW this publication
       and determine effects to mission execution.
       4.5.3.4. Crew Rest Interruptions. Any official business or duty that requires the active
       participation of a crew member interrupts the crew rest period. This includes official
       business conducted on the telephone or other electronic means. If crew rest is interrupted
       so that the individual cannot get the opportunity for 8 hours of rest, the individual must
       be afforded the opportunity to meet minimum crew rest hours plus reasonable time to
       dress, eat, travel, etc. Intentional crew rest interruption shall only be made under the most
       exceptional circumstances. The individual must consider unofficial interruptions so that
       the intent of this paragraph is met. If crew rest is interrupted, individuals will inform their
       supervisory chain. If necessary they can be removed from the mission schedule.
   4.5.4. Fatigue Management. AFISRA will emphasize alertness management programs or
   procedures to minimize the risks associated with mission crew fatigue and shift work
   disorder.
       4.5.4.1. Assessments should include the fatiguing effects of weather, extremes of
       temperature, poor sleeping conditions (due to both location and time of day), and mission
       delays.
       4.5.4.2. Commanders, mission planners, and MOCs must continually execute operational
       risk management (ORM) assessments and implement alertness management strategies
       such as: extending crew rest periods, pre-planned crew splits, bright light or physical
       activity breaks, and fatigue management education and training.
4.6. Currency. The Ready Intelligence Program (RIP) is designed for operators to remain
mission proficient through accomplishment of designated mission tasks at specified intervals.
AF DCGS crew members who fail to complete RIP tasks IAW AFISRAI 14-153 Volume 1
revert to N-BMC/N-CMR. The process to regain BMC/CMR is outlined in AFI 14-202 Volume
1 and AFISRAI 14-153 Volume 1, Chapter 5.
4.7. Crew Scheduling.
   4.7.1. Squadron Director of Operations (DO) will:
       4.7.1.1. Establish, in writing, pre-mission reporting timelines for all assigned or attached
       AF DCGS mission crews.
       4.7.1.2. Sign completed AFISRA Form 178, Mission Planning Sheets (MPS) or AFISRA
       approved form at least 24 hours prior to mission execution and after review and
       concurrence by Current Operations, Operations Training and Stan/Eval. Return signed
       MPSs to Operations Scheduling for publication.
4.8. Operations Tempo (OPSTEMPO) and Personnel Tempo (PERSTEMPO)
Reports. The OPSTEMPO and PERSTEMPO will be accomplished by all units and reported
through applicable chain of command IAW AFISRA/A3 guidance.

5.5. Tactics After Action Report (TAAR). The TAAR supports the AF DCGS enterprise and
units by providing timely, tactically-relevant information. AF DCGS TAARs are used to share
significant tactics lessons learned and innovations outside the normal annual Tactics
Improvement Proposal (TIP) process.
   5.5.1. The unit weapons and tactics office will generate and maintain AF DCGS TAARs to
   report information from exercises, contingency operations, tactics conferences, testing, and
   other events. All TAARS will be forwarded to the 480 ISRW weapons and tactics office for
   consideration/dissemination.
5.6. Crew Information Files (CIF)/Mission Control Notes (MCN). CIFs are used to inform
mission crewmembers on items of interest pertaining to the system and/or personnel (e.g.,
changes in operating procedures, deployment procedures, software changes, etc.) Tasking
information will not be included in the CIF program. MCNs contain mission tasking information
and instructions for implementing United States Signals Intelligence Directives (USSIDs),
Combined SIGINT Operating Regulations (CSORs), SIGINT Control Messages (CONMSG),
Intercept Tasking Database (ITDB) instructions, theater/AOR directed tasking (e.g.,
Reconnaissance, Surveillance, Targeting and Acquisition (RSTA) Annex), special emphasis
tasking, Special Instructions (SPINS), temporary collection adjustments, and/or locally generated
tasking guidance. MCNs are used by AF DCGS mission crews to direct and execute mission
tasking. Guidance on procedures and preparation of CIFs and MCNs will be spelled out in Wing
and subordinate unit supplements. The 480 ISRW will develop, publish and maintain enterprise-
level CIFs and MCNs. CIFs/MCNs expire after 90 days.
5.7. Mission Databases. Unit Operations Mission Management is responsible for maintaining
access to mission databases such as OB, Signals of Interest (SOI), Digital Terrain Elevation Data
(DTED), Imagery Product Library (IPL), Unified Collection Operation Reporting Network
(UNICORN), Imagery Exploitation Support System (IESS), etc., IAW local procedures.
5.8. Mission Briefings/Debriefings. The unit’s mission briefing program is the responsibility
of operations mission management. Units will establish local procedures for preparing and
conducting mission briefings ensuring provided checklists are incorporated.

                                           Chapter 6

                                 MISSION PREPARATION

6.1. Mission Planning. This includes the processes from initial ISR and PED allocation at the
Joint level to planning processes at the force provider and sensor planning.
   6.1.1. Mission Planning Cycle. The mission planning cycle starts with a request for forces
   (RFF) from the COCOM or a theater OPLAN or Planning Order (PLANORD). During the
   GFMAP process, the SECDEF allocates ISR resources to the various COCOMs and through
   the appropriate channels tasks AFISRA and 480 ISRW with the execution of AF DCGS PED
   of theater-allocated ISR assets. Tasking includes platforms and sensors supported and
   allocation of weight of effort for COCOM target exploitation. Upon receipt of tasking,
   AFISRA delegates the 480 ISRW long range operations planners to coordinate with theater
   AOCs and LNOs to determine projected ISR flight schedules and generate a long-range
   schedule, initially allocating missions across the AF DCGS enterprise.
6.2. Global Force Management Allocation Plan (GFMAP). Under SECDEF direction, the
Joint Staff tasks AF DCGS direct support to the COCOMs and allocates AF DCGS weight of
effort through the GFMAP (GFM of PED Resource Allocation CONOP, dated 7 Feb 12).
AFISRA will posture, report and present AF DCGS enterprise capabilities and capacity to the
Joint Staff for tasking. In the absence of specific direction and guidance in the Global Military
Force Policy (GMFP), AF DCGS ISR posture is based on Table 6.1.
6.3. AF DCGS Long-Range Scheduling. 480 ISRW planners will develop long-range plans
(greater than 72 hours) to allocate AF DCGS postured capacity IAW Joint Staff tasked mission
sets. Planners will allocate missions to AF DCGS units and publish and maintain a long-range
schedule on a daily basis for the AF DCGS enterprise. The schedule will account for, and
deconflict, projected GFMAP tasking, unit postured capacity, system installations, site/system
outages, maintenance downtime needs and unit reconstitution periods, as well as other
operational factors.
6.4. Tasking and Collection Authorities. Tasking varies for AF DCGS units depending on the
unit, supported theater and sensor needs. SIGINT and/or GEOINT tasking may come directly
from COCOMs, C-NAFs, theater warfighters, and/or national authorities.
6.5. AF DCGS Distributed Mission Planning and the PED Tasking Order (PTO). The 480
ISRW WOC will generate and maintain an AF DCGS enterprise PTO for all AF DCGS elements
presenting PED capacity. Following theater air tasking order (ATO) cycles, 480 ISRW PED
Controllers extract specific ISR mission times and allocate AF DCGS PED (based on
capacity/capability) through publication of a PTO. The PTO will project tasked ISR missions
and assign AF DCGS elements to support those assets. Additionally, the WOC apportions
tasked targets to the AF DCGS enterprise and federated mission partners for exploitation.
6.6. Collection Routes and Sensor Collection Plans. Unit SPs will develop routes IAW
paragraph 4.1.4 prior to mission execution, and sensor plans prior to sensor collection, when
applicable. The planners will take into account flying unit requirements, sensor collection
parameters and optimal collection criteria.

                                    MISSION EXECUTION

7.1. General Guidelines. The guidelines in this chapter contain the minimum requirements for
mission execution. The lead wing for operational execution will develop baseline enterprise
standards for mission execution products and forward to AFISRA for review and distribution.
   7.1.1. All missions phases and functions will be conducted IAW applicable USSIDs,
   Combined SIGINT Operating Regulations (CSOR), AOR tasking and rules of engagement
   (ROE), USAF and HQ AFISRA Instructions, AFTTP 3-1 DCGS and locally-developed
   checklists and guidelines. Deviations from the listed guidance need to be addressed with
   applicable OPRs.
   7.1.2. Mission crew procedure waiver requests for AF DCGS will be submitted to the parent
   Wing Commander for review and approval when deviations from typical mission processes
   occur. Forward copies of all approved waivers through applicable command channels to
   AFISRA/A3. Waiver requests must include the following:
       7.1.2.1. Mission crew procedure to be waived and applicable reference.
       7.1.2.2. Justification for waiver.
       7.1.2.3. Include the unit plan of action to remedy the situation if available.
7.2. Crew Pre-Mission Preparations. Mission crews will perform, at a minimum, the
following tasks prior to mission start:
   7.2.1. Arrival and check-in. Each mission crewmember will report for mission crew duty at
   the unit appointed time, ensuring they have sufficient crew rest. Each crewmember will
   notify his/her mission reporting chain of their arrival.
   7.2.2. Theater Intelligence Data Review. The MOC or DART should brief all available
   current theater intelligence data to provide the entire mission crew an understanding of
   ongoing theater activities and operations.
   7.2.3. NOTAM/CIF/MCN Review. Crewmembers will review Volume I Part B, Current
   Read File of the Intelligence Read File (IRF) library which will include HHQ IRFs, CIFs,
   and MCNs and any pertinent mission materials prior to the pre-mission briefing (PMB).
   Crew members will use AFISRA Form 109 or AFISRA approved crew data management
   tool to annotate compliance with NOTAMs, IRFs, CIFs and MCNs.
   7.2.4. Mission Crew Materials Verification. Each crewmember will perform an inventory of
   all position mission materials, and notify mission reporting chain if issues need to be
   addressed.
   7.2.5. Pre-Mission Briefing. The MOC, GMS, CMS, IMS and MSA (as applicable) will
   conduct a PMB for the mission crew prior to mission operations start. All mission
   crewmembers are required to participate in the PMB while attendance of other personnel
   (i.e., contractors, logistics support, etc.) is based upon need-to-know.
       7.2.5.1. Lead site must provide all mandated PMB items and ensure distributed mission
       sites and crews participate in the PMB. Only items pertinent to the planned mission must
AFISRAI14-153V3 15 MARCH 2013                                                                   27


      be covered, and items listed may be briefed in any sequence. Those items published in
      AFIs, AFTTPs or applicable guidance and understood by all participants may be briefed
      as “standard”. The MOC is responsible for ensuring all mandated PMB items are
      covered.
      7.2.5.2. Units may designate specific crewmembers and/or DART personnel to brief
      specific portions of the PMB, when applicable.
   7.2.6. System Status Verification. Prior to mission launch/start, the applicable mission
   crewmembers will verify the operational status of mission equipment (e.g., Deployable
   Ground Intercept Facility (DGIF), Ground Control Processor (GCP), Common Imagery
   Exploitation System (CIES), and applicable distributed operations positions).
      7.2.6.1. To facilitate determining operational status of mission equipment, the unit will
      develop a listing of equipment outages that constitute non-mission capable (NMC),
      partially mission capable (PMC) and fully-mission capable (FMC) equipment by system
      and by segment.
      7.2.6.2. If any required systems are NMC or PMC or are projected to be inoperable, the
      MOC, IMS or GMS will declare the appropriate segment NMC or PMC as appropriate.
      If a mission critical segment or system is declared NMC, follow the procedures to
      recommend launch/mission delay in paragraph 7.2.8. Crews will use their best
      judgment in determining mission impact caused by PMC systems and will make a
      determination as to whether they should delay launch/mission start.
   7.2.7. Personnel Status Verification. Prior to mission launch/start, the MOC, GMS, IMS
   and/or CMS will verify that the mission crew is on-station and prepared to execute missions
   and that qualified operators are assigned to each required position and that Go/No-Go criteria
   has been determined and communicated as required. If minimum crew manning position
   listed in the CML cannot be manned for any reason, follow the procedures for
   launch/mission delay in paragraph 7.2.8.
   7.2.8. Launch/Mission/Abort Delay.       Prior to mission start, recommend delay aircraft
   launch or mission start if the primary sensor or primary mission equipment are, or are
   projected to be, NMC or a minimum crew manning position(s) cannot be manned at aircraft
   launch or mission start time. The MOC will contact the WOC and the theater Senior
   Intelligence Duty Officer (SIDO) to inform them of the No-Go situation. Theater commands
   will specify procedures for redesignation of assets or exceptions to this policy. If the theater
   does not designate the primary sensor and intends on launching the ISR asset in No-Go
   status, the WOC may direct the non-support of the ISR asset or reallocate the mission to
   another AF DCGS mission crew or location if available.
7.3. Mission Operations.
   7.3.1. Use of Crew Materials. All mission crewmembers will utilize established mission
   materials for their respective crew position (see paragraph 5.3).
   7.3.2. Crew Communications. When capable, all crewmembers assigned to a mission will
   use crew communication equipment and ensure situational awareness/coordination between
   mission segments IAW local procedures.

  7.3.3. Mission Start-up.        Mission    crewmembers      will   complete    all      start-up
  procedures/checklists.
  7.3.4. Mission Handoffs. During continuous operations, mission crews need to ensure
  effective transfer of missions between crews. On-duty crewmembers will fully brief
  relieving crewmembers of ongoing and upcoming theater operations, mission situations,
  collection and reporting status, crew position problems, and subordinate crewmember status.
  Oncoming mission crews must obtain an understanding of ongoing mission operations prior
  to assuming control of the crew position.
  7.3.5. On-Watch. The GMS will declare On-Watch upon first instance of SIGINT collection
  or upon mission platform on-station whichever occurs first. The GMS will provide this
  information to the supported platform and appropriate agencies IAW theater/local guidance.
  7.3.6. On-Station. The AOC ATO specifies the scheduled on-station time for the platform
  and the pilot in command of the supported ISR platform declares the platform “on-station”
  IAW with COCOM directives.              Mission supervisors will ensure that all mission
  crewmembers are in-place, mission equipment is properly functioning and all start-up
  checklists are complete prior to the scheduled mission on-station time.
  7.3.7. AF DCGS mission crews will maintain situational awareness of mission events in
  order to take advantage of potential adhocs, cross-cues and other actions that allow mission
  crews to best execute the ISR mission.
  7.3.8. Mission crews will execute specified duties for the mission position they are manning
  IAW weapons system standards, procedures and directives. Mission crews will demonstrate
  professional discipline at all times and use sound judgment in making timely and logical

     destruction of mission equipment and materials IAW local procedures, when applicable.
  7.3.13. Off-Station. The AOC ATO will specify the scheduled off-station time for the
  platform, and the pilot in command of the supported ISR platform will declare the platform
  “off-station” IAW with COCOM directives.
  7.3.14. Off-Watch. Off-Watch declaration is at the GMS discretion and will be based upon
  active collection levels and known or suspected threats to supported aircraft. The GMS will
  use his/her best judgment when assessing collection levels and threat criteria before
  terminating collection activities. Off-watch will not be declared prior to mission platform
  off-station.
     7.3.14.1. SIGINT mission supervisors will ensure that all SIGINT mission crewmembers
     terminate mission operations and initiate end-of-mission and post-mission checklists and
     procedures.
  7.3.15. Aborted/Relaunched/Restarted Missions. When a mission is aborted and is
  relaunched or restarted, units may use the same mission crew, provided MDP and monthly
  crew hour provisions are observed. Units will carefully consider the circumstances of the
  original abort, the mission to be accomplished, and the condition of the mission crew. If a
  backup crew is used instead, the original crew may perform other duties.

       the DMS-NASIC Requirements Manager via multiple tasking channels.                     The
       Requirements Manager will coordinate with the requesting AF DCGS element or
       supported unit to refine the requirement and will work directly with AF DCGS and
       theater collection managers to ensure collection planning is being accomplished to satisfy
       RFI-driven PED requirements. Prioritization will be based on COCOM and theater
       priority intelligence requirements (PIRs), Last Time Intelligence of Value (LTIOV), and
       the opportunity to satisfy requirements based on all available collection.
       9.8.1.3. DMS-NASIC PED Tool Support. DMS-NASIC will provide its own internal
       PED tool support for current and future AF DCGS capabilities.
9.9. 70 ISRW.
   9.9.1. The 70 ISRW is the AF’s cryptologic wing and provides cryptologic expertise to the
   AF DCGS enterprise. As a mission enabler, the 70 ISRW provides unique capabilities in the
   form of SIGINT Quick Reaction Capability (QRC), Global Linguist capability, and Signals
   Development & Analysis Cell (SDAC).
       9.9.1.1. SIGINT QRC Cell develops, fields, standardizes and integrates capabilities
       within ISR PED and AF DCGS. Due to its access and testing proximity within NSA,
       Distributed Mission Site-Maryland (DMS-MD) may leverage national QRCs, field and
       integrate new exploitation techniques within the AF DCGS architecture. The ability to
       incorporate QRCs into AF DCGS ensures access to timely and current SIGINT
       capability.
       9.9.1.2. Global Linguist Capability. The 70 ISRW is home to the Air Force Less
       Commonly Taught Languages Center of Excellence. The 70 ISRW maintains global
       linguist capacity to respond to contingencies, crisis and varying mission requirements at a
       moment’s notice. The 70 ISRW provides target focused collection operators needed to
       satisfy mission requirements.
       9.9.1.3. Signals Development & Analysis Cell (SDAC). When tasked, the Consolidated
       Remote Operations Facility Airborne (CROFA) provides advanced PROFORMA and
       Special Signals post mission analysis and reporting for the AF DCGS enterprise. This
       cell leverages the signals analysis expertise organic to the 70 ISRW along with NSA
       derived resources and technology to analyze and exploit challenging signals during and
       post mission execution. The SDAC also ensures updated target knowledge, regarding
       PROFORMA and Special Signals, are incorporated back into the enterprise for target
       development and threat warning.
9.10. Expeditionary PED Cell . When directed by HHQ, the 480 ISRW will establish and man
a forward deployable PED node to support expeditionary operations. The Expeditionary PED
Cell will be supported primarily with personnel and resources from the DCGS enterprise and will
act as an extension of the DCGS enterprise where applicable. Governances and standards are
applicable to this cell even while under the direction of theater combatant commanders.

9.11. AF National Tactical Integration Program. The AF NTI program integrates United
States SIGINT System (USSS) resources with theater air and space components to ensure
seamless support to the DCGS weapon system. The AF NTI team shifts the focus of national
SIGINT performance from discovering and reporting data to collaboratively generating
actionable intelligence for the JFACC. The AF NTI team capitalizes on data acquisition
capabilities, existing databases and datalinks of multiple national SIGINT sources and access to
AF analysts in the AOC, National Cryptologic Centers (NCC) (e.g., NSA/CSS Texas) and
AFISRA intelligence production organizations (e.g., NASIC). AF NTI also supports the
targeting cycle by contributing tailored intelligence to assist in both kinetic and non-kinetic
target development and pre- and post strike assessment. While the program remains
predominately SIGINT focused, the AF NTI enterprise also has the ability to leverage all
AFISRA capabilities to include, but not limited to, AF tactical ISR assets such as the DCGS
community within the 480th ISR Wing and AF intelligence production centers like NASIC. The
organizational structure of the AFISRA and the AF NTI enterprise lends itself to multi-discipline
ISR operations.
