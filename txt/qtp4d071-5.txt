                                       INTRODUCTION
1. This qualification training package (QTP) was developed to make available a training aid that will
assist Diet Therapy Technicians in developing technical skills essential to performing specialized tasks.
The tasks are broken down into teachable steps, which help the trainer guide the trainee into becoming
proficient with the tasks. The QTP will also aid the task certifier when evaluating trainees for task
certification.

2. As a trainer, direct the trainee to review the training references to better understand the objective of
this QTP. Go through the steps in the task performance (checklist) with the trainee and allow for enough
time to learn each step; some steps may take more time than others. Remember that the purpose of this
QTP is to ensure the trainee can perform each task thoroughly. When the trainee receives enough training
and is ready to be evaluated on the objective, follow the evaluation instructions. Conduct a feedback with
the trainee on this QTP. After you have ensured and documented that the trainee is qualified to perform
the task, the trainee should be evaluated by a certifier.

3. The goal of the developers of this QTP is to publish a useful document for trainers and trainees that
will meet Air Force needs under the concepts outlined in the Career Field Education and Training Plan
(CFETP). We value your expertise in meeting this goal. If you find discrepancies in this QTP, or have
suggestions for its improvement, or if you have suggestions for other areas that may benefit from a QTP,
please let us know about them.

EQUIPMENT REQUIRED:                       None
OBJECTIVE:                               The trainee will successfully develop a Management
                                         Plan Index (MPI) designed for quick reference.
                                         Information included in the section’s management
                                         plan should provide decision-makers with the data
                                         needed to plan, direct and implement section
                                         activities. Additionally, collection of this data into
                                         one guidebook will facilitate the inspection process.


EVALUATION:                              After the trainee has completed the MPI, evaluate the
                                         individual’s organizational skills and whether the
                                         items they have included in the index reflect an
                                         understanding of their facility’s specific requirements.

REMARKS/NOTES:                           Steps identified are related to each task subject. Task
                                         names listed above are not in any mandatory order
                                         and are neither all-inclusive nor exclusive to any
                                         facility.

                           Develop a Management Plan Index


EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. This QTP should be evaluated during actual performance of the tasks or as an end
   product evaluation. (Whichever applies.)

2. After the trainee has received instructions, allow sufficient practice on each part of the
   task. The trainee must satisfactorily perform all parts of the task.

3. Use the appropriate checklist when evaluating the task to ensure all steps of the task
   are accomplished. NOTE: The extent to which the trainee actually produces,
   develops and assembles the Management Plan material is at your discretion. The
   intent of this QTP is that the trainee be able to locate, identify and organize required
   documentation, not to recreate what you already have. If the documents will be
   useful to you have the trainee provide or update the documents as necessary at your
   facility. If the trainee successfully accomplishes the objective, document
   appropriately in the individual’s training record. If the trainee does not accomplish the
   objective, review the areas needing more training until the objective is met.

4. Document competency upon satisfactory completion of the evaluation. Initial
   evaluation should be documented in the Specialty Training Standard (STS) of the
   trainee’s CFETP. All recurring evaluation should be documented using AF Form
   1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, or using an approved
   substitute record.
