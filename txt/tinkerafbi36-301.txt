SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision updates regulatory references, clarifies responsibilities and updates office titles and
symbols.
1. TINKER AIR FORCE BASE POLICY: The Air Force and Tinker Air Force Base policy
is to eliminate or reduce to the lowest possible level all hazards, physical hardships and working
conditions of an unusually severe nature, commonly referred to as hazardous conditions. When a
hazard cannot be eliminated or controlled, an environmental differential may be warranted. The
authorization of an environmental differential is not to be interpreted as condoning the situation
 2                                                       TINKERAFBI36-301 14 JULY 2010


which warrants the pay, rather, continuing positive action will be taken to eliminate the danger
and/or risks which contribute to or cause the situation to be classified for differential pay.
Assignment of duties involving exposure to such situations will be limited to the minimum
amount of time and number of employees practical for successful task accomplishment.
2. RESPONSIBILITIES:
     2.1. Supervisor:
        2.1.1. Supervisors of a work situation involving a potentially hazardous situation are
        responsible for reporting the situation through the EDP/HPD program and must strive to
        eliminate and/or reduce the hazard.
        2.1.2. Supervisors of areas with approved EDP/HPD situations are responsible for
        reporting any changes to the situation that may affect the EDP/HPD determination. Each
        currently authorized situation will be reviewed at least bi-annually by the supervisor in
        coordination with the Civilian Personnel Flight.
     2.1.3. The supervisor will document and forward EDP/HPD information to the servicing
     Civilian Pay Office. The supervisor is responsible for providing the EDP/HPD Manager (72
     FSS/FSMCEC) a list of personnel detailed or temporarily loaned to duties requiring exposure
     to an approved situation and will ensure only approved situations are forwarded to the
     servicing Civilian Pay Office.
     2.2. Civilian Personnel Section:
        2.2.1. Acting for the 72d Air Base Wing Commander (72 ABW/CC), the Civilian
        Personnel Section (72 FSS/FSMC) will manage the EDP/HPD Program and designate an
        EDP/HPD Manager.
        2.2.2. The EDP/HPD Manager will:
            2.2.2.1. Coordinate with and/or solicit technical evaluation/opinion from other
            members of the Safety Office (72 ABW/SE), Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight
            (72 AMDS/SGPB), and servicing Civilian Pay Offices (72 CPTS/FMFC) as may be
            required for the effective administration of the EDP Program.
            2.2.2.2. Coordinate with management officials in identifying work situations which
            may warrant EDP coverage under Appendix J of OPM FWS Appropriated Fund
            Operating Manual or HPD under Appendix A covered by 5 CFR 550. Also
            coordinates with management in reviewing work situations currently authorized
            EDP/HPD to determine if the hazard has been reduced or eliminated.
            2.2.2.3. Coordinate with or obtain the technical evaluation/opinion of the Safety
            Office (72 ABW/SE) and/or Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight (72 AMDS SGPB)
            when the work situation being evaluated requires such technical opinion.
            2.2.2.4. Approve or disapprove work situations for EDP/HPD based upon evaluation
            against defined categories in the OPM FWS Appropriated Fund Operating Manual or
            5 CFR 550 and based upon the technical opinion of the appropriate staff office when
            such opinion is required.
            2.2.2.5. Establish and maintain appropriate records in support of approval or
            disapproval of EDP/HPD situations.
TINKERAFBI36-301 14 JULY 2010                                                                    3


         2.2.2.6. Schedule site-audits of approved EDP/HPD situations with management
         officials, supervisor, Safety Office (72 ABW/SE) and Bioenvironmental Engineering
         Flight (72 AMDS/SGPB) at least bi-annually. Review of approved EDP/HPD
         situations may be conducted as often as deemed necessary to properly evaluate the
         situation.
  2.3. Safety Office (72 ABW/SE) and Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight (72 AMDS/
  SGPB) will: Upon request, furnish the EDP/HPD Manager technical evaluation or opinion
  regarding hazards, physical hardships and working conditions of an unusually severe nature
  which may affect the safety and/or health of employees at their work site. In the evaluation
  process, they will use the instructions provided in the OPM FWS Appropriated Fund
  Operating Manual or 5 CFR 550.

  according to 5 CFR 5 50.903.
5. PROCEDURES FOR INITIAL EDP SITUATION REVIEW/APPROVAL:
  5.1. Management officials responsible for a work situation involving a hazard will review
  the situation, requesting assistance from the Safety Office (72 ABW/SE), Bioenvironmental
  Engineering Flight (72 AMDS/SGPB) and the groupâ€™s production engineering office as
  needed, to determine if the use of engineering controls, replacing toxic materials with non- or
  less toxic products, personal protective equipment (PPE), work practice changes, good
  housekeeping, or other protective measures can eliminate the condition. If the hazard cannot
  be eliminated or reduced to a level that is no longer significant, the supervisor will report the
  condition through appropriate organizational levels (as a minimum must be one level above
4                                                          TINKERAFBI36-301 14 JULY 2010

       employee was first exposed to the EDP/HPD condition.
    5.2. The EDP/HPD Manager will review the request for coverage under appropriate
    EDP/HPD guidelines. If the situation meets the requirements of the guidelines, the EDP/HPD
    Manager will assign a control number. The request will then be forwarded to the Safety
    Office (72 ABW/SE) and Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight (72 AMDS/SGPB), as
    appropriate. These organizations will investigate the situation, complete the appropriate
    portions of AF Form 683, attach written comments or reports concerning their
    evaluation/opinion and return the request to 72 FSS/FSMCEC, Attn: EDP/HPD Manager.

    employees affected as to approval/disapproval of the request.
6. PROCEDURES FOR REVIEW OF AN APPROVED EDP/HPD SITUATION:
    6.1. The first-level supervisor has the primary responsibility for ensuring that continuing
    action is effected to eliminate or reduce to the lowest possible level the danger or risk that
    contributes to or causes the hazard. Any changes to the situation that may affect the
    EDP/HPD determination will be reported in writing to 72 FSS/FSMCEC, Attn: EDP/HPD
    Manager, as soon as practical. The EDP/HPD Manager will review the report and determine
    if additional action is warranted.
    6.2. A review of each approved EDP/HPD situation will be conducted at least bi-annually,
    more frequently if appropriate, based on the schedule established at the time of approval of
TINKERAFBI36-301 14 JULY 2010                                                                   5
