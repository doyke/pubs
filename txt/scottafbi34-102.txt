building is a multipurpose facility, technically known as a “theater,” only during the time it is
used for showing motion pictures by AAFES.

and responsible for scheduling the use of the base theater, (618) 256-2126 or DSN 576-
2126/2623.

3.   General:
     3.1. All activities requiring use of the base theater for education, training, commander’s call,
     related military presentations, and non motion picture entertainment, will schedule the base
     theater through the 375 FSS/CCE. Recurring requests will be made, in writing, not later than
     1 November each year. Infrequent requests may be made by telephone. The user will
     appoint a representative to obtain all necessary equipment and ensure all requirements are
     complete. The using agency will bear full responsibility for the building security,
     appearance, and condition of audio equipment. Also, podiums are available for activity use.
     If a sound system is needed to support a large function, the user will be responsible for
     procuring the necessary equipment.
     3.2. The using agency is responsible for presenting the program and providing the required
     visual aid equipment. Use of AAFES-owned projection equipment, except for the screen, is
     prohibited. If additional assistance is required with the audio equipment, the user must
     contact the 375th Communications Squadron (375 CS) to make arrangements. Only properly
     trained personnel will be permitted access to the audio system controls and cassette system.
     The 375 CS will provide additional public address and/or audiovisual equipment for official
     events only. Arrangements of the event must be made in advance to receive the necessary
     training.
4. Procedures:
     4.1. Using agency representative will:
        4.1.1. Sign out a building key on an AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.
        4.1.2. Check building, to include latrines and surrounding area, for cleanliness before
        and after use.
        4.1.3. Ensure there is “No Smoking” inside the Base Theater.
        4.1.4. Remove equipment or furniture brought into the facility and ensure that equipment
        or furniture belonging to the facility remains.
        4.1.5. Report discrepancies or damage immediately to the 375 FSS/CCE.
        4.1.6. Secure building and return key to the 375 SVS/CCQ.
     4.2. Keys may be picked up at the 375 SVS/CCQ, Bldg 1911, Room 219. When required
     for early morning or weekend use, keys will be picked up between 1430 and 1530, the
     workday before scheduled use. For late morning or afternoon use, they may be picked up no
     earlier than 0830 on that day. Keys will be returned no later than 2 hours after use, unless
     otherwise agreed.
     4.3. The building custodian must notify the 375th Civil Engineer Squadron (CES),
     Operations Flight, Customer Service Section (CSS) at commercial (618) 256-2202/DSN 576-
     2202, if cleaning services need to be rescheduled or cancelled due to a major event. In turn,
     CSS will notify the 375 CES/CEOE, Maintenance Engineering custodial QAE, at
     commercial (618) 256-4710/DSN 576-4710, to take appropriate action. The building
     custodian will also ensure that all reported discrepancies are turned in to the 375 CES or 375
     CS for correction. If damages are found to be intentional, a report will be made to the 375
     FSS/CCE to decide on the corrective action.
SAFBI34-102 16 APRIL 2001                                                                     3


5. Those organizations that require use of the Base Theater for more than 1 day will ensure that
equipment left is removed from the immediate stage and audience areas. Equipment will be
either removed entirely from the building or placed off-stage. Equipment and stage props can
remain in-place only when arrangements have been made to completely close the Base Theater
to all other users. Safety and fire requirements must always be maintained.
6. Requests to close the Base Theater from AAFES use must be made, in writing, at least 12
workdays prior to the event. This action is required to cancel movie plans without an unexpected
loss of income to AAFES or their employees. The only exception is an emergency military
requirement.
7. Organizations planning to utilize the base theater for alternate entertainment purposes
(i. e., talent shows, puppet shows, and dance recital performances) will submit requests, in
writing, 30 days in advance to the 375 FSS/CCE, who will coordinate with AAFES for final
approval. The request must show time frame, type of entertainment, and whether performers are
from an off-base facility. These performances must be free of charge.
8.   Failure to comply with the requirements in this instruction will restrict future use.
