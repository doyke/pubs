1. General.
     1.1. The purpose of this Operating Instruction is to define and outline specific requirements
     and individual responsibilities between 319 ABW Grand Forks AFB, ND and tenant units as
     identified by AFI 21-101 Section 3.2.6.
     1.2. Since the 319 ABW has no aircraft assigned, the 69 MXS will maintain the crash
     recovery response trailer (equipment) and vehicle. The 319 ABW CDDAR program is a
     combined effort of the 319 ABW, 69 RG and the 119 Wg. The equipment and vehicle will be
     shared; however, each unit is responsible for providing manning to recover/reclaim their
     respective aircraft.
     1.3. Because the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) MQ-9’s are not DoD assets,
     they have their own recovery procedures. The 69 MXS CDDAR team will assist as needed,
     but CBP will be in charge of the operation.
     1.4. For mishaps involving transient aircraft, 319 TA will coordinate with the IC to
     determine assistance requirements.
        1.4.1. Due to the many unknown factors of airframe conditions immediately following a
        crash landing, do not attempt to use special equipment or procedures not included in the
        specific aircraft technical orders, or without approval of the specific airframe system
        manager/engineer. The owning agency of any transient aircraft will be contacted for
        technical advice pertaining to the specific aircraft.
     1.5. Wreckage will not be disturbed IAW AFI 91-204, Safety Investigation and Reports with
     the exception of essential rescue operations or to prevent interference with vital air
     operations as deemed necessary by the 319 ABW/CC or the IC. Refer to 319 ABW IEMP
     10-2.
     1.6. Incidents involving aircraft made up of a composite structure may cause serious injury
     or death to those in contact with it. T.O. 00-105E-9, Aerospace Emergency Rescue and
     Mishap Response Information contains information regarding aircraft-specific composite
     component location, and should be consulted when responding to aircraft incidents. Transient
     aircraft’s home base should be contacted to determine composite materials risk and
     requirements for PPE.
     1.7. Personnel will use extreme caution in and around a disabled aircraft. CDDAR personnel
     will ensure that the aircraft remains stable at all times to prevent movement or shifting. It
     may be necessary to moor the aircraft or stabilize using airbags.
2. Specific Responsibilities.
     2.1. 319 ABW/CC:
        2.1.1. Will approve and direct implementation of the recovery plan, IAW GFAFB IEMP

         assist in CDDAR operations under the direct supervision of the CDDAR Team Chief
         and team members.
         2.5.3.8. Upon notification of an accident, the CDDAR Team Chief will begin the
         recall process to assemble the CDDAR Team. During normal duty hours, team
         members will respond immediately to Bldg. 609, 69 MXS Wheel & Tire Shop.
         During non-duty hours, CDDAR team members will report to Bldg. 609 within one-
         hour of notification.
     2.5.4. 69 MXS Age:
         2.5.4.1. For RQ-4/MQ-1 aircraft, 69 MXS AGE will provide AGE equipment to
         support and sustain the recovery effort as requested by IC and/or CDDAR Team
         Chief.
3. CDDAR Equipment Requirements
  3.1. Primary response vehicle will be a 6-passenger, 1-ton, 4-wheel drive pickup with pintle
  hook and trailer (utility body). Vehicle will be equipped with necessary emergency lights and
  a radio capable of monitoring all maintenance nets, to include the MOC and fire dispatch net
  independently with the capabilities to switch to ATC nets. The trailer will contain the
 6                                        GRANDFORKSAFBI21-105 22 SEPTEMBER 2014


     necessary TO’s, tools, spare wheels/tires, axle jacks and safety equipment to perform
     immediate response operation.
     3.2. Vehicles will be available on a 24-hour basis. If the base does not own or have
     immediate access to any of these vehicles, the Base Contracting Office must have a
     contingency plan in place to rent or lease these vehicles from a local supplier. Vehicles that
     may be required to support a CDDAR effort are listed in Figure 1.
     3.3. The CDDAR Team Chief will ensure the CDDAR assets are inspected for serviceability
     before and after each exercise or real-world use. Periodic inspections must be accomplished
     and documented in accordance with applicable Technical Orders. Perform operational checks
     according to applicable directives during exercises and/or inventory reviews.
