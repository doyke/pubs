implemented/extended.

1. Overview: This instruction establishes a common baseline of terminology and procedures
for critical events that require a high degree of integration. The ability to synchronize the efforts
of the numerous moving pieces that support and execute the wing mission requires a significant
unity of effort. This instruction will be used as a basis of defining and clarifying commonalities
that exist within the missile wing. If the guidance contained within this instruction conflicts with
higher-level guidance or technical data, contact the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for
resolution.
2. Commander’s Intent: This instruction is the byproduct of over a year’s worth of Root
Cause Analysis (RCA) events at the 341st Missile Wing. A reoccurring theme among these
RCA events was inadequate or ineffective communication. As such, the terminology and
 2                                                              341MWI13-501 25 APRIL 2013


guidance contained within this instruction will be incorporated into local training, checklists and
guidance.

4. Cross Discipline Terminology:
     4.1. The following terms are critical to achieve effective communication between the
     different disciplines related to the Launch Facility (LF) security system. These terms are to
     be used, as appropriate, whenever an event concerning security is relayed over the telephone
     or documented in any form of maintenance write-up, log entry or blotter entry.
        4.1.1. Function Check – A Function Check is initiated by the MCC at a manned LF. A
        Function Check consists of three critical elements: the triggering and reporting of the
341MWI13-501 25 APRIL 2013                                                                     3


     Outer Zone (OZ) alarm, the triggering and reporting of the Inner Zone (IZ) alarm, and the
     ability to reset both OZ and IZ alarms using Sensitive Command Network Tests (SCNTs)
     initiated and monitored by the MCC. This definition is derived from the 20AFI31133.
     4.1.2. Inoperative (INOP) IZ – An IZ security system is declared inoperative when any
     of the following conditions exist: incorrectly configured equipment, an incomplete or an
     unsuccessful Security System Checkout, as defined in TO21MLGM30G24, or when
     deemed inoperative IAW MMOC or Electromechanical Team (EMT) technical data. An
     IZ that does not reset following a SCNT may be functional; however it is deemed INOP
     due to its inability to satisfy nuclear surety requirements per AFI91114. This definition is
     derived from the TO21MLGM30G24 and TO21M-LGM30G218.
     4.1.3. INOP OZ – An OZ security system is declared inoperative when any of the
     following conditions exist: incorrectly configured equipment, an incomplete or an
     unsuccessful Security System Checkout, as defined in TO21MLGM30G24, or when
     deemed inoperative IAW MMOC or EMT technical data. An OZ that does not reset
     following a SCNT may be functional; however, it is deemed INOP due to its inability to
     satisfy nuclear surety requirements per AFI91114. This definition is derived from the
     TO21MLGM30G24 and TO21MLGM30G218.
     4.1.4. Operative IZ – The IZ security system can normally be considered operational
     when the following three conditions are met: (a) the IZ alarm is reset at the Launch
     Control Center (LCC), (b) the IZ security response to a SCNT is normal at the LCC and
     (c) the performance and successful completion of all maintenance tasks directed by the
     TO21MLGM30G24.          This definition is derived from the Forward of the
     TO21MLGM30G24.
     4.1.5. Operative OZ – The OZ security system can normally be considered operational
     when the following four conditions are met: (a) the OZ alarm is reset at the LCC, (b) the
     OZ security response to a SCNT is normal at the LCC, (c) the performance and
     successful completion of all maintenance tasks directed by the TO 21MLGM30G24 and
     (d) the OZ is not considered an Unreliable OZ. This definition is derived from the
     Forward of the TO21MLGM30G24.
     4.1.6. Security System Checkout – A Security System Checkout is performed IAW the
     TO21MLGM30G24. Anytime a Security System Checkout is required but not
     successfully completed, the affected security alarms are considered inoperative. The
     affected security system will remain INOP until the appropriate Security System
     Checkout is accomplished. An incomplete Security System Checkout can apply to only
     the IZ or OZ portion of Table 3-1 of TO21M-LGM30G-2-4. A successful IZ Security
     System Checkout may have an incomplete/unsuccessful OZ Security System Checkout—
     in this instance the IZ will be operational with an INOP OZ. Anytime there is an
     incomplete IZ Security System Checkout, the OZ will be considered an Unreliable OZ.
     Only an EMT or maintenance team authorized by the MXG/CC, with access to the
     Launcher Equipment Room (LER), can perform the Security System Checkout. This
     definition is derived from the TO21M-LGM30G-2-4.
     4.1.7. Unreliable OZ – An Unreliable OZ is due to an INOP IZ at a site that was
     penetrated. These conditions cause the radar system portion of the OZ to use an incorrect
     baseline set of data, thus the OZ is unreliable. An Unreliable OZ is only possible at a site
4                                                               341MWI13-501 25 APRIL 2013


       that has been penetrated and had the security drawer circuit breaker cycled.            This
       definition is derived from the TO21M-LGM30G-2-4.
       4.1.8. True Status – Status reported by the security system that accurately represents the
       security condition of the site. True status is verified by the appropriate security system
       functional checks, proper LF back out procedures and proper system response to SCNTs
       sent by the MCC (TO21M-LGM30G-1-24 allows up to three SCNTs to get a good reset).
       This definition was provided by the Air Force Safety Center.
    4.2. The following terms are used to define alert status of a LCC or an LF:
       4.2.1. Fully Mission Capable (FMC) – The system or equipment is functioning as
       required in TO specifications and is capable of performing all of its assigned missions.
       This definition is derived from AFI21-103.
       4.2.2. Not Mission Capable (NMC) – The system or equipment does not meet the TO
       specifications; therefore, cannot accomplish any of its assigned missions or functions.
       This definition is derived from AFI21-103.
       4.2.3. Partially Mission Capable (PMC) – System or equipment functioning in such a
       way that it can perform at least one, but not all of its assigned missions; functions
       impaired but usable. Systems with redundant capabilities will be coded PMC when
       redundancy is lost, even though the system is fully capable of supporting all of its
       assigned missions. This definition is derived from AFI21-103.
       4.2.4. Off-Alert – Sortie is non-launch capable, directed to be off alert IAW Crew
       Document Annotation Procedure (CDAP) or is in a condition requiring off alert status as
       determined by MMOC. An Off-Alert sortie is considered NMC. This definition is
       derived from the glossary of AFGSCI135304.
       4.2.5. Crew Document Annotation Procedure (CDAP) – Procedure that prevents an
       Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) from launching with an incorrect delay time, on
       an incorrect target or with a hardware condition that could prevent it from reaching it
       OPLAN target. This definition is derived from the glossary of AFGSCI135304.
           4.2.5.1. Hardware Off-Alert – A launch capable sortie off alert due to a hardware
           problem that prevents launch against a strategic target until the condition is corrected.
           For example, a launch capable sortie with a stuck Safety Control Switch (SCS) key
           would be called Hardware Off-Alert. This is because the missile would be able to
           process critical launch commands. By processing these commands, the Missile
           Guidance Set (MGS) will abort terminal countdown and shutdown due to the SCS
           key. This will further delay the ability of returning the sortie to a FMC state.
           Another variant of Hardware Off-Alert would be if incorrect software, programs or
           tapes were loaded into an operational LF. This definition is derived from the glossary
           of AFGSCI135304.
           4.2.5.2. Targeting Off-Alert – A sortie that has incorrect targeting, that cannot be
           resolved, will be considered Targeting Off-Alert. Situations would include: (a) the
           inability to Remote Data Change (RDC) targeting case data or Execution Plan (EP)
           case data to a sortie at case effective time due to a condition at the LF, (b) an input
           abort of target case or EP case data, (c) a generation abort of target case or EP case
341MWI13-501 25 APRIL 2013                                                                      5


          data and (d) when a planned Re-entry System (RS) configuration change does not
          occur by targeting case effective time. This definition is derived from the
          HITTF 214.
5. Audit Program:
   5.1. The Audit Program is used to ensure that an accurate site picture is maintained between
   the Maintenance Group (MXG), the Operations Group (OG), and the Security Forces Group
   (SFG) regarding the security systems used at LF. A goal of the Audit Program will be to
   identify processes or policies that can be refined to improve the effectiveness of cross
   organization communication and interaction.
   5.2. Program Requirements:
      5.2.1. At least three audits will be performed per quarter with support from
      341 MXG/QA, 341 OG/OGV and 341 SFG/SFV.
