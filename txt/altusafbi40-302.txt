SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision
incorporates the revised roles and responsibilities of the Installation Commander, Medical
Director, PAD Program Coordinator, Unit Commanders, PAD Site Coordinators, and Clinical
Engineering. The Event Procedures were outlined in more detail. Training and Exercise
Procedures were added. The previous Attachment 3 was deleted, and location of AEDs was
listed in paragraph 5. Paragraph 6 was added to delineate the Purchasing and Maintenance of
 2                                                     ALTUSAFBI40-302 29 November 2011


AEDs. Quality assurance was incorporated into 2.3. Paragraph 7 regarding the Good Samaritan
Act was added. Attachments 3-7 were added.
1. Scope.
     1.1. SCA is the leading cause of death in the United States. SCA causes the victim to lose
     consciousness, stop breathing and become pulse less. SCA victims need immediate help--
     waiting for emergency personnel to arrive at the scene can lead to delays in care and reduce
     the chances for survival. For every minute that passes without use of the AED, a victim’s
     chance of survival decreases 10 percent. The scope of training and use is applicable to all
     federal employees and active duty personnel at Altus AFB.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. Installation Commander (97 AMW/CC): The Commander of the 97th Air Mobility
     Wing has overall responsibility for the PAD program. The 97 AMW/CC directs the
     Commander of the 97th Medical Group to ensure proper medical objectives are maintained
     for the PAD program.
     2.2. Medical Group Commander (97 MDG/CC): The 97 MDG/CC is responsible to the 97
     AMW/CC for implementation of the PAD program. The 97 MDG/CC will ensure all
     medical objectives are maintained and provide professional guidance on program
     administration. The 97 MDG/CC will appoint, in writing, a Medical Director and PAD
     Program Coordinator for the PAD program.
     2.3. Medical Director: The PAD Medical Director will be a physician, proficient in

     for PAD Site Coordinators and the manufacturer representatives for problems with AEDs.
        2.7.1. Will be responsible for annual inspections as well as any maintenance beyond the
        site coordinator’s ability to accomplish using the manufacturer owner’s manual.
        2.7.2. Will help PAD Site Coordinators with supply part numbers for re-ordering and
        purchase information for additional AEDs.
        2.7.3. Will notify any affected area of a device recall, alert or required software upgrades
        and take appropriate corrective action.
        2.7.4. Can provide AED loaners. If an AED is brought in for service, and the service
        will take over one hour, the unit may ask for a loaner AED. AED loaners are not for long
        term loan over 30 days.
     2.8. Targeted Responders.      Each work center with an AED will have responders for
     emergency situations.
        2.8.1. Those individuals will be certified, at a minimum, in Adult Heartsaver AED CPR
        by a national or state approved course instructor, such as the MTN, AHA or American
        Red Cross.
3. Event Procedures.
     3.1. Responders should arrive with the AED to an emergency call as quickly as possible
     (optimally within 3 minutes) and start or help with CPR. Use of the local section specific
     response checklist is highly encouraged (Attachment 4).
        3.1.1. Mobile AED units will monitor radios for Man Down emergency calls on the
        flight line. They will respond to the event site in the quickest and safest manner possible.
     3.2. The responding individual(s) will complete an event summary sheet (Attachment 2)
     when an AED is used on a victim. They will also notify the PAD Site Coordinator that an
     event has occurred. The event summary form will be given to the PAD Site Coordinator to
     be forwarded to the Medical Director or designee within one duty day of the event.
4. Training and Exercise Procedures.
     4.1. The PAD Site Coordinator will coordinate with work center supervisors to ensure that a
     sufficient number of individuals are selected and trained per shift so a responder is readily
     available at the AED location. This includes flight line vehicles that carry AEDs.
5. AED Location.
     5.1. AEDs should be strategically placed throughout a facility to reduce time between victim
     collapse and ability to provide initial shock, when indicated, to the victim. Factors to
     consider in determining AED placement include the following:
        5.1.1. Facility size and or accessibility.
        5.1.2. Number of employees in the facility.
        5.1.3. Identified high risk environments.
        5.1.4. Average age of the facility occupants; older populations are at higher risk.
ALTUSAFBI40-302 29 November 2011                                                            5


      5.1.5. Security levels that may hinder access to the facility by emergency response
      crews.
      5.1.6. Use of high voltage equipment.
   5.2. AED accessory kits should be with the AED so that the responder will not lose time
   deciding what to take to the emergency. Accessories for use with the AED are listed on
   Attachment 5.
   5.3. AEDs carried in vehicles should be removed from the vehicle when the vehicle is not in
   use. AED battery life is highly affected by cold and hot weather and may reduce the ability
   of the unit to deliver a shock when needed.
   5.4. At a minimum, AEDs will be placed in the locations listed below. Other locations may
   have AEDs on site. A complete list of AED locations can be obtained from Clinical

                       QUICK RESPONSE CHECKLIST SAMPLE

This attachment is a quick response checklist to be used by person administering AED or CPR.

Figure A4.1. Quick Response Checklist Sample.
      #             REQUIREMENT                                               Completed
      1             Check for response (make mental note of time for
                    event report). Ensure victim is unconscious and not
                    breathing.
      2             Tell someone to phone emergency response (911) and
                    get an AED. (If alone and a phone/AED are nearby –
                    call first and get the AED) For adults – as soon as
                    AED is available it should be applied to unconscious
                    victim.
      3             If victim isn’t breathing or only gasping give CPR.
      4             Bare victim’s chest and locate CPR hand position
                    (middle finger lined up with nipple).
      5             Begin CPR. Deliver first cycle of 30 compressions at
                    a rate of 100 compressions per minute (ensure full
                    chest recoil).
      6             Open the airway and give 2 breaths for 1 second each.
                    Look for chest rise.
      7             Continue delivering cycles of 30 compressions and 2
                    breaths until the AED is available.
                    ONCE AED IS AVAILABLE
      8             Open AED cover.
      9             Tear open package and follow voice prompts to place
                    pads on chest
      10            Once AED senses that pads are in place it will begin
                    to analyze victim. Follow voice prompts and do NOT
                    touch the victim. If shock advised, follow prompts.

          1              Check the status indicator on the AED
                         handle to ensure it is GREEN. When status
                         is GREEN, AED is ready for use.
          2              If the status indicator is RED, bring the unit
                         to Clinical Engineering (room 1059
                         building 46) for repair.
