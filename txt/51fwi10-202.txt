3. SORTS Training Requirements.
   3.1. SORTS Monitor Training Consist of Three Phases:
      3.1.1. Phase I – Unit specific SORTS training by current certified unit SORTS monitor.
      The unit must have ―step-by-step‖ instructions on completing the SORTS report. The
      unit’s training program must include unit unique SORTS report formats and checklists
      that explain how the unit compiles and submits the unit’s SORTS report, highlighted
      worksheets IAW the unit DOC statement for training purposes, instructions on how to
      translate the unit’s DOC statement requirements to the SORTS report and a documented
      51 FW Form 15. Tailor the examples and checklists to allow a newly appointed SORTS
      monitor to compile and submit the unit’s report with minimum supervision.
      3.1.2. Phase II – Initial SORTS familiarization by 51 FW/OC. Training is provided
      monthly. If special circumstances exit, one-on-one training may be accomplished by
      appointment with 51 FW/OC.
      3.1.3. Phase III – Manpower training by 51 FSS/FSMM. The training will consist of the
      following elements:
          3.1.3.1. Interpreting manpower requirements to report based on DOC statement.
          3.1.3.2. Interpreting the UMD and SORTS UMD extracts.
          3.1.3.3. Interpreting the MANFOR UTC Report if required.
          3.1.3.4. Completing the Manpower portion of the Personnel Computation Worksheet.
          3.1.3.5. Completing the Manpower portion of the Personnel C-Level Worksheet.
   3.2. Monitors are considered fully trained and certified when all three phases of training
   have been signed off on the training certificate for 51 FW requirements. However, to
   complete the AFI 10-201 requirements the monitors must attend the Air Force SORTS MTT.
   3.3. Initial SORTS orientation training for commanders and designated releasing officials
   can be satisfied by one-on-one training by the 51 FW SRO or by reviewing the 51 FW/OC
   SORTS PowerPoint presentation.
   3.4. On the spot training will be conducted at turn-in as warranted.
   3.5. Training will be documented on 51 FW Form 15.
4. Monthly SORTS Turn-In procedures and Guidelines
   4.1. A monthly SORTS turn-in letter will be emailed to the unit SORTS monitors,
   commanders and releasing officials NLT the 5th duty day of the month.
10                                                           51FWI10-202 5 SEPTEMBER 2012


        4.1.1. Unit monitors will accept/decline the date and time provided within 3 duty days of
        receipt. If appointment is declined, the unit monitor must give a reason and provide an
        alternate date and time that is in accordance with reporting guidelines (i.e. within the 28-
        30 day reporting window).
        4.1.2. If a conflict arises after the appointment has been accepted the unit monitor must
        notify the 51 FW/OC immediately for resolution. No shows will be reported to the unit
        commander and (if necessary or requested) be reported to the 51 FW/CC or designated
        official.
     4.2. SORTS reports will be typed; hand-written ink or pencil reports will not be accepted.
        4.2.1. If the unit does not have the resources to type the report, they will make an
        appointment with the 51 FW/OC prior to their turn-in appointment to complete the report
        using the 51 FW/OC computer.
        4.2.2. Emergency situations warranting ink or pencil submissions will be allowed with
        the permission of the 51 FW/OC only.
  4.3. Any and all changes from the previously submitted SORTS report will be highlighted
  on the new SORTS reports using bolding or a highlighting option.
  4.4. Changes or errors to SORTS reports will be quickly identified and corrected and the unit
  monitor will obtain the commander or releasing officials signature in a timely manner.
        4.4.1. Report corrections will not be held for unit commander return from leave, TDY,
        etc. The alternate releasing officials will be utilized appropriately as that is their duty in
        the absence of the commander.
