SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been extensively rewritten and should be read in its entirety. It incorporates
all changes resulting from the cancellation of National Security Space Acquisition Policy 03-01,
and Secretary of the Air Force-directed changes to HQ Air Force Space Management and
Organization. All areas of the AFI were updated, the most important of which are:

Areas added: reference to the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for
Developmental Test and Evaluation (DASD(DT&E)); integrated testing policy and definition;
distinctions between Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP) changes versus administrative
updates; direction for implementing MAJCOM T&E focal points; testing of training devices;
scientific test and analysis techniques (STAT) initiatives; reliability growth planning; testing
rapid acquisition and urgent operational needs; references and direction for unified capabilities
(UC) testing, emissions security (EMSEC) assessments; direction for platform information
technology (PIT) systems; tier waiver authority annotations for compliance items; and Chief
Developmental Tester (CDT) responsibilities.

Areas deleted: all of Chapter 8 on space system testing; the terms seamless verification and key
decision point (KDP); all references to the Program Management Directive (PMD); and the
USAF range precedence rating system.

Areas modified: many subjects are moved to new locations that align better with the acquisition
timeline; the phrase “strategy for T&E” replaces “T&E strategy” when describing the
overarching plan for program testing; the integrated test concept (ITC) is more fully described;
new flexibility is added for using TEMP alternatives; the term “Lead Developmental Test and
Evaluation Organization (LDTO)” universally replaces “Responsible Test Organization (RTO)”
to reflect new statutory language; references and direction are expanded for interoperability,
information assurance (IA), security testing, and system certification and accreditation (C&A);
strategies for archiving T&E data and information are expanded; and due dates for Multi-Service
Operational Test and Evaluation (MOT&E) final reports are clarified.

                           TEST AND EVALUATION CONCEPTS

1.1. Purpose of Test and Evaluation (T&E). The overarching functions of T&E are to mature
system designs, manage risks, identify and help resolve deficiencies as early as possible, assist in
reducing unintended cost increases during development, operations, and throughout the system
life cycle, and ensure systems are operationally mission capable (i.e., effective, suitable,
survivable, and safe). T&E provides knowledge of system design, capabilities, and limitations to
the acquisition community to improve system performance before production and deployment,
and to the user community for optimizing system operations and sustainment after production
and deployment. The T&E community will:
   1.1.1. Collaborate with capability requirements sponsors and system developers to field
   effective and suitable systems that meet program baseline goals for cost, schedule, and
   performance.
   1.1.2. Provide timely, accurate, and affordable information to decision makers to support
   production and fielding decisions.
   1.1.3. Provide data and information in support of managing risks during acquisition, fielding,
   and sustainment by accurately characterizing system technical and operational performance
   throughout the system life cycle.
   1.1.4. Help the acquisition and sustainment communities acquire and maintain operationally
   mission capable systems for Air Force users.
   1.1.5. Provide information to users to assess mission impacts, develop policy, improve
   requirements, and refine tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP).
1.2. The Acquisition Environment. The Integrated Life Cycle Management (ILCM)
Framework is the overarching system of concepts, methods, and practices the Air Force uses to
effectively manage systems from capability gap identification through final system disposal.
The goals of ILCM are to recapitalize Air Force capabilities through maximum acquisition cycle
time efficiency, provide agile support that will optimize fielded capabilities and the supply chain,
minimize the logistics footprint, and reduce total ownership cost. ILCM begins with
capabilities-based requirements development and continues with capability-based acquisition,
T&E, expeditious fielding, sustainment, and demilitarization. See AFI 63-101/20-101 for
details.
   1.2.1. Evolutionary Acquisition (EA). EA is the preferred DoD strategy for rapid
   acquisition of mature technology for the user IAW DoDI 5000.02. An evolutionary approach
   delivers capability in increments, recognizing up front the need for future capability
   improvements. The objective is to balance needs and available capability with resources, and
   to put capability into the hands of the user quickly. The success of the strategy depends on
   phased definition of capability needs and system requirements, maturation of technologies,
   and disciplined development and production of systems with increased capability. For
   software development, an incremental approach is similar to the EA strategy, but does not
   repeat every phase and decision point for each increment.

    1.2.2. Collaborative Concepts and Processes. ILCM is based on concepts and processes
    described in AFI 10-601, AFI 63-101/20-101, AFI 33-210, and this AFI. Figure 1.1 shows
    the acquisition process as the “master clock” for the integration of requirements, acquisition,
    information assurance (IA) activities, and T&E events. Sections of Figure 1.1 are used at the
    beginning of Chapters 4, 5, and 6 to illustrate key events during each acquisition phase.
    These diagrams represent the full spectrum of processes and events. DoD and AF guidance
    provides program managers (PM) with the flexibility to tailor programs, within certain limits,
    to meet specific program requirements.
    1.2.3. Integrated Warfighting/Cross-Domain Test and Evaluation. The ability to
    successfully conduct a mission may require the integration of activities and products from a
    combination of primary weapon systems, support systems, and enabling systems (e.g., air,
    space, land, sea, cyberspace, and operations centers). Comprehensive testing of interoperable
    systems is essential in validating expected mission performance, identifying vulnerabilities,
    and developing and validating effective employment TTP.
    1.2.4. Capabilities-Based Testing. Capabilities-based testing evaluates the capability of the
    system to effectively accomplish its intended mission in a realistic mission environment
    rather than simply meet individual technical specifications. The current emphasis on joint
    military operations in an information-intensive environment means that Air Force systems
    will seldom operate in combat as completely independent entities. Air Force systems are
    expected to fully integrate with systems, activities, and products from all Services and
    National agencies. Capabilities-based testing requires a full understanding of joint
    operational concepts in order to develop test scenarios that will provide meaningful results.
    1.2.5. Information Technology (IT) and Agile Software Development (ASD). Nearly all
    systems today have IT content and require some level of IA, interoperability, and security
    testing. The lower bar in Figure 1.1 shows additional requirements from the 33-series AFIs
    for IT and software-intensive systems as they are integrated with the requirements,
    acquisition, and T&E processes.
       1.2.5.1. Some IT and business systems may use ASD methodologies based on rapid
       incremental development and fielding. The requirements and solutions for these systems
       evolve quickly via continuous collaboration between small, self-organizing, cross-
       functional teams. Agile methods break tasks into small increments of proven capability,
       use minimal documentation, are tolerant of changing requirements, and have iterations
       typically lasting from a few weeks to a few months. The emphasis is on software that
       works as the primary measure of progress. Agile concepts and practices are being
       embraced by segments of the DoD as a potentially effective approach for software
       development under the right circumstances for some categories of software-intensive
       systems. DoD testing for agile development will evolve as more experience is gained
       with the process, and this AFI will be updated to reflect those changes as they occur.
       1.2.5.2. Iterative, incremental development (IID) applies ASD processes and is gaining
       acceptance as an acquisition strategy for DoD IT systems. IID is used when no science
       and technology development is needed. Top level operational requirements may not be
       defined in sufficient detail up front and must be determined and verified based on
       authoritative feedback from users. Increments in IID are intended to provide the basis for
       this requirements refinement. Users must interact with actual systems capabilities during
AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                        9


        development, often in real-world environments, in order to provide useful feedback. The
        IID strategy instills a test-driven development methodology in every agile release.

1.3. General T&E Principles. The following T&E principles are IAW DoD 5000-series
documents and lessons learned. The unifying theme is that all testers must collaborate to the
 10                                                              AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013


fullest extent possible to effectively evaluate programs and systems regardless of organizational
affiliation. Because the acquisition process is fluid, testers must ensure the intent of this AFI is
implemented at all times.
   1.3.1. Tailoring. The Integrated Test Team (ITT) ensures that all strategies for T&E,
   concepts, plans, briefings, and reports are flexible and tailored to fit the specific needs of
   acquisition programs consistent with sound systems engineering practices, program risk,
   statutory and regulatory guidelines, the time-sensitive nature of users’ requirements, and
   common sense. If a project or program is authorized to enter the acquisition process at other
   than the beginning (e.g., entry at Milestone (MS) B), the ITT reviews all activities that would
   normally be accomplished prior to that point and ensure that any mandatory prerequisites are
   accomplished. T&E planning, execution, and reporting must also be tailored for emerging
   contingencies.
   1.3.2. Pre-MS A Tester Involvement. The early provision of T&E expertise and technical
   and operational insight to acquisition professionals and requirements developers, preferably
   before the Technology Development phase, is a key to successful initiation of new programs.
   The earlier the involvement, the greater the opportunity to reduce unintended increases to
   development, operations, and life cycle costs. Candidate materiel solution approaches are
   better understood and risks reduced when T&E practitioners make technical contributions to
   early acquisition planning activities.
   1.3.3. Early Deficiency Identification. Deficiencies must be identified as early as possible
   to enable resolution, increase program efficiency and economy of effort.
   1.3.4. Event-Driven Schedules and Exit Criteria. Adequate time and resources must be
   planned and provided for all T&E activities IAW DoDD 5000.01. T&E activities must
   demonstrate the system meets established engineering objectives, operational capability
   requirements, and exit criteria before moving to the next phase of development. The PM
   must ensure the system is stable and mature before it is certified ready for dedicated
   operational testing.
   1.3.5. Integrated Testing. Integrated testing is the collaborative planning and collaborative
   execution of test phases and events to provide shared data in support of independent analysis,
   evaluation, and reporting by all stakeholders, particularly the developmental (both contractor
   and government) and operational test and evaluation communities. Effective ITTs plan and
   execute testing that is integrated across the entire program lifecycle; that integrates with the
   program’s requirements generation and system engineering processes; that evaluates system
   interoperability of a system of systems or family of systems, as applicable; and that integrates
   developmental and operational test. Integrated testing is a concept for test management and
   design, not a new type of T&E. It structures T&E to reduce the time needed to field effective
   and suitable systems by providing qualitative and quantitative information to decision makers
   throughout the program’s life cycle. Integrated testing minimizes the gaps between
   contractor, developmental, and operational testing by implementing integrated testing
   techniques and objectives to the maximum extent possible.
       1.3.5.1. Integrated testing must be intentionally designed into the earliest program
       strategies, plans, documentation, and test plans, preferably starting before MS A. From
       the start, test planning must consider the entire lifecycle of program activities from
       technology development through disposal, including testing relevant to manufacturing
AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                      11


     and sustainment. The earlier integrated testing strategies are developed and adopted, the
     greater the opportunities and benefits. If done correctly, integrated testing will identify
     system design improvements early in developmental test and evaluation (DT&E), reduce
     the amount of T&E resources needed for operational test and evaluation (OT&E), and
     help PMs control unintended increases to development, operations, and life cycle costs.
     1.3.5.2. Test planning must be integrated with the requirements generation process and
     the system engineering process, yielding requirements that are testable and achievable,
     and test plans that provide actionable capabilities-oriented test results. Integrated testing
     orients government T&E of materiel solutions toward a capabilities-based approach to
     requirements and operational mission needs rather than pass-fail measurements of
     specification-like requirements. Capability-based testing ensures strategies and plans for
     T&E are derived from the operational environment and functionality specified in
     validated operational capabilities requirements. It requires an understanding of how
     systems will be employed in operational environments and mandates that strategies for
     T&E and plans be designed to determine whether a new capability solution merits
     fielding. Furthermore, in light of the joint operational environment, effective test
     planning and execution integrates with testing of other systems to evaluate
     interoperability.
     1.3.5.3. Integrated testing may include all types of test activities such as modeling and
     simulation (M&S), contractor testing, developmental and operational testing,
     interoperability testing of a system of systems or family of systems, as appropriate, IA
     testing, and certification testing as described in Chapter 2. All types of testing,
     regardless of the source, should be considered, including tests from other Services for
     multi-Service programs. Tests will be integrated to the maximum extent possible as
     described in Chapters 4 through 7. Software intensive and information technology (IT)
     systems will use the reciprocity principle as much as possible, i.e., "Test by one, use by
     all." Note: This AFI will use the term “integrated testing” to capture this broad intent.
     “Integrated DT&E/OT&E” is the most common combination, but many other
     combinations are possible.
     1.3.5.4. All testers collaborate as an ITT to generate an overarching strategy for T&E
     and test plans that are integrated. These plans must leverage all available test activities
     and resources while minimizing redundant testing and waste. The result is an integrated
     test approach with harmonized test plans that efficiently work together throughout the
     acquisition program, and not necessarily a single test plan. An integrated test concept
     (ITC) must be developed as part of the Test and Evaluation Strategy (TES) and the Test
     and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP) when initiating test planning as described in
     paragraphs 4.11, 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4
     1.3.5.5. Integrated testing must provide shared data in support of independent analyses
     for all stakeholders. Shared data provides continuous written feedback from test
     organizations to the PM and other stakeholders on all aspects of program development.
     For each program, a common T&E database is required according to paragraph 5.16 that
     includes descriptions of the test environments and conditions to ensure commonality and
     usability by other testers. Integrated testing must plan for and provide T&E data for
     separate, independent initial OT&E (IOT&E) according to 10 United States Code
     (U.S.C.) § 2399, DoDI 5000.02, and the Defense Acquisition Guidebook (DAG), Chapter
 12                                                           AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013


       9. It does not necessarily include the earliest engineering design or data from early
       prototypes which may not be relevant.
   1.3.6. Objectivity. All Air Force T&E activities must be objective, unbiased, and free from
   outside influences to ensure the integrity of evaluation results IAW AFPD 99-1. Air Force
   programs ensure objective DT&E by designating a lead developmental test and evaluation
   organization (LDTO) that is separate from the program office. An independent operational
   test organization (OTO) is assigned to ensure objective OT&E for all programs.
1.4. Integrated Test Team (ITT). The PM establishes an ITT as soon as possible after the
Materiel Development Decision (MDD) as shown in Figure 1.1 to create and manage the
strategy for T&E for the life of each program. The ITT construct is central to carrying out
integrated testing and is equivalent to the T&E Working-level Integrated Product Team (T&E
WIPT) described in the DAG, Chapter 9. The PM and the lead OTO co-chair the ITT using the
general T&E principles outlined in paragraph 1.3. ITT membership includes all organizations
needed to implement a comprehensive and integrated test strategy for as long as T&E is needed.
Typical ITT member organizations are described in paragraph 4.4.4. Also see the Air Force Test
and Evaluation Guidebook for details about ITT structure, responsibilities, charters, and
functions. The Guidebook is available on the AF/TE portion of the Air Force Portal
(https://www.my.af.mil).
1.5. How this Document is Organized. This AFI follows the acquisition process phases in
DoDI 5000.02 as shown in Figure 1.1. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 contain direction most pertinent to
achieving the goals of MS A, B, and C respectively. Each chapter’s activities typically support
that particular MS or phase, but depending on program needs, may be partially completed or
even deferred to the next phase. The sequence of activities presented generally follows the flow
of Figure 1.1, but in all cases, planning for each area should be started as early as practical.
Note: Programs that enter the acquisition process after MS A must accomplish the necessary
“stage-setting” activities specified for the preceding milestones in Chapters 4 and 5.
1.6. Applicability and Authority. The policies and processes in this AFI are for use by all Air
Force T&E organizations and acquisition programs, modification and sustainment programs,
MAJCOM-directed acquisition programs, and projects regardless of ACAT, unless otherwise
noted. See DoDI 5000.02, Enclosure 3, for details about ACATs. Air Force Special Access
Programs (SAP) and other sensitive programs (e.g., BIG SAFARI projects) will follow the intent
of this AFI to the extent that security considerations allow. Exceptions to policy will be
coordinated with SAF/AAZ, Security and Special Program Oversight, SAF/AQL, Special
Programs, SAF/AQI, Information Dominance, or AF/TE, Test and Evaluation, as applicable.
Note: In this AFI, guidance provided for “MAJCOM” test activities shall be understood to apply
also to FOA and DRU test activities (except the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation
Center (AFOTEC)).
   1.6.1. Hierarchy of Authority. Authority for this AFI flows from congressional statute
   through DoD-level issuances, and AFPD 99-1, Test and Evaluation. Specific details for
   implementing this policy are delegated to and more appropriately developed by Air Force
   MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs, and their subordinate designated T&E organizations based on
   specific mission areas and needs.
   1.6.2. Hierarchy of Knowledge Management. It is not possible for this AFI to prescribe
   detailed T&E policy and TTP for each of the Air Force’s many mission areas, programs, and
AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                       13


   T&E activities. Therefore, all T&E organizations must establish tailored, disciplined, and
   collaborative processes for planning, executing, and reporting T&E activities.
   1.6.3. Qualification of Test Personnel. In order to apply the T&E principles in paragraph
   1.3, a highly trained and qualified T&E workforce is required. Supervisors and commanders
   at all levels are expected to enforce applicable qualification standards in accordance with this
   and other applicable DoD and Air Force policy.
1.7. Areas Not Covered by this AFI. The systems, programs, and activities listed in the sub-
paragraphs below are not within the purview of this AFI.
   1.7.1. Nuclear weapons systems. Joint T&E of nuclear weapons systems is governed by
   joint DoD-Department of Energy agreements. Nuclear and non-nuclear components, sub-
   systems, and associated product support elements that require testing and nuclear
   certification throughout the system life cycle remain covered as described in AFI 63-103,
   Joint Air Force National Nuclear Security Administration (AF-NNSA) Nuclear Weapons Life
   Cycle Management, and AFI 63-125, Nuclear Certification Program.
   1.7.2. Industrial maintenance inspections.
   1.7.3. Activities associated with the space experimentation program described in AFI 10-
   1202, Space Test Program (STP) Management.
1.8. Compliance Items. Each unit (wing or equivalent, and below, DRU, FOA) compliance
item is identified with a Tier waiver authority number. A “T-0” denotes a requirement external
to the USAF; requests for waivers must be processed through command channels to AF/TEP for
consideration. For “T-1” items, the waiver authority is the MAJCOM/CC (delegable no lower
than the MAJCOM Director), with the concurrence of AF/TE.
   1.8.1. The AFOTEC/CC is delegated waiver authority for AFOTEC “T-1” compliance items
   with concurrence of AF/TE.
   1.8.2. In accordance with the acquisition chain of authority specified in AFI63-101/20-101,
   mandates to the acquisition execution chain are not considered Wing level mandates and
   tiering does not apply.

                                            Chapter 2

                           TYPES OF TEST AND EVALUATION

2.1. Major Categories of Testing. Air Force testing falls into two overarching categories,
developmental testing and operational testing. If a specific T&E requirement does not fall
precisely into one of the following discrete categories of testing, consult with AF/TEP to select
and tailor the type of testing that best fits the need.
2.2. Developmental Testing. Developmental testing is conducted throughout the acquisition
and sustainment processes to assist engineering design and development, and verify that critical
technical parameters (CTP) have been achieved. DT&E supports the development and
demonstration of new materiel solutions or operational capabilities as early as possible in the
acquisition life cycle. After full-rate production (FRP) or fielding, DT&E supports the
sustainment and modernization of systems. To support integrated testing, as many test activities
as practical are conducted in operationally relevant environments without compromising
engineering integrity, safety, or security. Developmental testing leads to and supports a
certification that the system is ready for dedicated operational testing IAW DoDI 5000.02,
Enclosure 6, and AFMAN 63-119, Certification of System Readiness for Dedicated Operational
Testing. In addition, developmental testing:
   2.2.1. Assesses the technological capabilities of systems or concepts in support of
   requirements activities described in AFI 10-601 (e.g., courses of action (COA)). Conducts
   research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) to investigate new concepts and
   technologies and collect basic scientific and engineering data.
   2.2.2. Provides empirical data for cost, schedule, and performance trade-offs.
   2.2.3. Uses M&S tools and digital system models (DSM); evaluates M&S tools for
   applicability; and performs verification and validation with actual test data to support
   accreditation of M&S tools.
   2.2.4. Identifies and helps resolve deficiencies and vulnerabilities as early as possible.
   2.2.5. Verifies the extent to which design risks have been minimized.
   2.2.6. Verifies compliance with specifications, standards, and contracts.
   2.2.7. Characterizes system performance and military utility.
   2.2.8. Assesses quality and reliability of systems. Quantifies manufacturing quality and
   contract technical performance.
   2.2.9. Ensures fielded systems continue to perform as required in the face of changing
   operational requirements and threats.
   2.2.10. Ensures all new developments, modifications, and upgrades address operational
   safety, suitability, and effectiveness (OSS&E); security; information assurance; environment,
   safety, and occupational health integration; and human systems integration IAW AFI 63-
   101/20-101.
   2.2.11. Supports aging and surveillance programs, value engineering projects, productivity,
   reliability, availability and maintainability projects, technology insertions, and other
AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                        15


   modifications IAW AFI 63-131, Modification Program Management, and Air Force
   Pamphlet (AFPAM) 63-128, Guide to Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle Management.
   2.2.12. Uses various kinds of funding depending on the nature and purpose of the work and
   the type of testing required. For specific funding guidance, see DoD 7000.14-R, Department
   of Defense Financial Management Regulation (FMR), Vol 2A, Chapter 1, and AFI 65-601,
   Budget Guidance and Procedures, Vol 1, Chapter 14.
2.3. Types of Developmental Testing. This AFI does not attempt to prescribe an all-inclusive
list of developmental test types. The potential exists for several developmental testing types to
overlap. The types of DT&E must be described in the TES, TEMP, and test plans to facilitate
planning and coordination for integrated testing. The following general DT&E types exist for
many acquisition programs:
   2.3.1. Qualification Test and Evaluation (QT&E). QT&E is a tailored type of DT&E
   conducted primarily for commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) items, non-developmental items
   (NDI), and government furnished equipment (GFE). Depending on user requirements, these
   and other items may require little or no government funded research and development
   (R&D), engineering, design, or integration efforts. PMs plan for and conduct T&E of COTS,
   NDI, and GFE even when these items come from pre-established sources. See paragraph
   5.12 for more information on COTS, NDI, and GFE. Note: QT&E generally uses
   procurement (e.g., 3010 [aircraft], 3020 [missiles], or 3080 [other]), or operations and
   maintenance (O&M) funds (i.e., 3400) IAW DoD 7000.14-R, Vol 2A, and AFI 65-601, Vol
   I, Chapter 14.
   2.3.2. Production-Related Testing. The PM ensures T&E is conducted on production
   items to demonstrate that specifications and performance-based requirements of the
   procuring contracts have been fulfilled. Defense Contract Management Agency personnel
   normally oversee this testing at the contractor’s facility. Typical tests (defined in
   Attachment 1) include: first article tests (FAT); lot acceptance tests (LAT); pre-production
   qualification tests (PPQT); production qualification tests (PQT); and production acceptance
   test and evaluation (PAT&E). Developmental and operational testers may observe, collect
   data, or participate during these tests as needed.
   2.3.3. Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E). LFT&E is a type of DT&E that provides
   timely, rigorous, and credible vulnerability or lethality test and evaluation of “covered”
   systems as they progress through the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD)
   Phase and early Production and Deployment Phase prior to FRP, or a major system
   modification that affects survivability. Survivability consists of susceptibility, vulnerability,
   and recoverability information derived from the firing of actual weapons (or surrogates if
   actual threat weapons are not available) at components, sub-systems, sub-assemblies, and/or
   full up, system-level targets. Modeling, simulation, and analysis must be an integral part of
   the LFT&E process. The Air Force must initiate LFT&E programs sufficiently early to
   allow test results to impact system design prior to FRP or major modification decisions. See
   paragraph 5.8 for more information; Attachment 1 for key definitions; and 10 U.S.C.§ 2366.
   The Air Force accomplishes LFT&E to:
       2.3.3.1. Provide information to decision makers on potential user casualties, system
       vulnerabilities, lethality, and system recoverability while taking into equal consideration
       the susceptibility to attack and combat performance of the system.

       2.3.3.2. Ensure system fielding decisions include an evaluation of vulnerability and
       lethality data under conditions that are as realistic as possible.
       2.3.3.3. Assess battle damage repair capabilities and issues. While assessment of battle
       damage repair is not a statutory requirement of LFT&E, test officials should exploit
       opportunities to assess such capabilities whenever prudent and affordable.
2.4. Operational Testing. Operational testing determines the operational effectiveness and
suitability of the systems under test. It determines if operational capability requirements have
been satisfied and assesses system impacts to both peacetime and combat operations. It
identifies and helps resolve deficiencies as early as possible, identifies enhancements, and
evaluates changes in system configurations that alter system performance. Operational testing
includes a determination of the operational impacts of fielding and/or employing a system across
the full spectrum of military operations and may be conducted throughout the system life cycle.
Operational testing may also evaluate or assess doctrine, organization, training, materiel,
leadership and education, personnel, facilities and policy (DOTMLPF-P).
2.5. Types of OT&E. OT&E is the formal field test, under realistic combat conditions, of any
item of (or key component of) weapons, equipment, or munitions for the purpose of determining
the effectiveness and suitability of that system for use in combat by typical military users, and
the evaluation of the results of such test. The types of operational testing listed below afford
operational testers a range of options for completing their mission. “Evaluations” collect,
analyze, and report data against stated criteria with a high degree of analytical rigor and are used
to inform FRP or fielding decisions. “Assessments” usually collect and analyze data with less
analytical rigor, need not report against stated criteria, and cannot be the sole source of T&E data
for FRP or fielding decisions. All programs that result in a FRP or fielding decision (full or
partial capability) require an appropriate type of operational testing supported by
sufficient independent evaluation to inform that decision. The OTO, in conjunction with the
user and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) oversight organizations (if applicable),
determines the appropriate level of operational testing required. Operational testing of COTS,
NDI, and GFE cannot be omitted simply because these items came from pre-established sources.
Acquisitions that support sustainment, to include acquisition of support equipment and form, fit,
function, and interface (F3I) replacements, require FRP or fielding decisions and an appropriate
type of operational testing. Operational testing must be based on approved operational
requirements documents specifically for the capabilities being fielded; however, the OTO has the
authority to test against expanded operational requirements based on real-world developments.
See the definition of OT&E in Attachment 1 for further information.
   2.5.1. Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E). IOT&E is the primary
   dedicated OT&E of a system before FRP or fielding as directed by DoDI 5000.02. IOT&E
   determines if operational requirements and critical operational issues (COI) have been
   satisfied and assesses system impacts to peacetime and combat operations. Tests are
   conducted under operational conditions, including combat mission scenarios that are as
   operationally realistic as possible. A dedicated phase of IOT&E is required for new ACAT I
   and II programs, as well as for all OSD OT&E Oversight programs IAW DoDI 5000.02. The
   determination of appropriate types of operational testing for subsequent modifications and
   upgrades, as well as applicability to other types of programs, will be accomplished according
   to paragraph 4.6. IOT&E shall be conducted only by AFOTEC. AFOTEC determines the
   operational effectiveness and operational suitability of the items under test using production
AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                     17


  or production-representative articles with stabilized performance and operationally
  representative personnel.
  2.5.2. Qualification Operational Test and Evaluation (QOT&E). QOT&E is a tailored
  type of IOT&E performed on systems for which there is little to no RDT&E-funded
  development effort. Conducted only by AFOTEC, QOT&E is used to evaluate military-
  unique portions and applications of COTS, NDI, and GFE for military use in an operational
  environment. QOT&E supports the same kinds of decisions as IOT&E. See paragraph 5.12
  for more information on COTS, NDI, and GFE.
  2.5.3. Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&E). FOT&E is the continuation
  of OT&E after IOT&E, QOT&E, or Multi-Service OT&E (MOT&E) and is conducted only
  by AFOTEC. It answers specific questions about unresolved COIs and test issues; verifies
  the resolution of deficiencies or shortfalls determined to have substantial or severe impact(s)
  on mission operations; or completes T&E of those areas not finished during OT&E.
  AFOTEC reports will document known requirements for FOT&E. More than one FOT&E
  may be required. Note: FOT&E that follows a QOT&E as described in paragraph 2.5.2 is
  funded with procurement (3010, 3020, or 3080) or O&M (3400) funds, not RDT&E 3600
  funds. See paragraph 5.2 for T&E funding sources, and paragraph 5.20 for test deferrals,
  limitations, and waivers.
  2.5.4. Force Development Evaluation (FDE). FDE is a type of dedicated OT&E
  performed by MAJCOM OTOs in support of MAJCOM-managed system acquisition-related
  decisions and milestones prior to initial fielding, or for subsequent system sustainment or
  upgrade activities. An FDE may be used for multiple purposes to include:
     2.5.4.1. Evaluate and verify the resolution of previously identified deficiencies or
     shortfalls, including those rated in AFOTEC reports as not having a substantial or severe
     impact on mission operations.
     2.5.4.2. Evaluate routine software modifications (e.g., operational flight programs
     (OFP)), subsequent increments, upgrades, and other improvements or changes made to
     sustain or enhance the system.
     2.5.4.3. Evaluate and verify correction of new performance shortfalls discovered after
     fielding of the system.
     2.5.4.4. Evaluate operational systems against foreign equipment.
     2.5.4.5. Evaluate operational systems against new or modified threats.
     2.5.4.6. Evaluate military-unique portions and applications of COTS, NDI, and GFE for
     military use.
  2.5.5. Multi-Service Operational Test and Evaluation (MOT&E). MOT&E is OT&E
  (IOT&E, QOT&E, FOT&E, or FDE) conducted by two or more Service OTOs for systems
  acquired by more than one Service. MOT&E is conducted IAW the T&E directives of the
  lead OTO, or as agreed in a memorandum of agreement between the participants. See the
  Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) on MultiService Operational Test and Evaluation
  (MOT&E) and Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&E), and the MOA on Operational Suitability
  Terminology and Definitions to be used in Operational Test and Evaluation
  (http://www.dote.osd.mil/policy.html). Also see paragraphs 4.6.6.4, 4.8 and 7.4.4 of this
18                                                          AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013


  Instruction. If MAJCOMs are involved in multi-Service testing without AFOTEC, they
  should use this MOA as a guide.
  2.5.6. Tactics Development and Evaluation (TD&E). TD&E is a tailored type of FDE
  conducted by MAJCOMs to refine doctrine, system capabilities, and TTP throughout a
  system’s life cycle IAW AFI 11-260, Tactics Development Program. TD&Es normally
  identify non-materiel solutions to problems or evaluate better ways to use new or existing
  systems.
  2.5.7. Weapons System Evaluation Program (WSEP). WSEP is a MAJCOM-conducted
  test program to provide an end-to-end tailored evaluation of fielded weapons systems and
  their support systems using realistic combat scenarios. WSEP also conducts investigative
  firings to revalidate capabilities or better understand munitions malfunctions.
  2.5.8. Operational Utility Evaluation (OUE). An OUE is an operational test which may
  be conducted by AFOTEC or MAJCOMs whenever a dedicated OT&E event is required, but
  the full scope and rigor of a formal IOT&E, QOT&E, FOT&E, or FDE is not appropriate or
  required IAW this AFI. OUEs may be used to support operational decisions (e.g., fielding a
  system with less than full capability, to include but not limited to integrated testing of
  releases and increments of IT capabilities) or acquisition-related decisions (e.g., low-rate
  initial production (LRIP)) when appropriate throughout the system lifecycle. OTOs may
  establish their supplemental internal guidance on when and how to use OUEs. Use of OUE
  or FDE to support MAJCOM-managed acquisition decisions is at the discretion of the
  appropriate MAJCOM staff or test organization.
  2.5.9. Operational Assessment (OA). OAs are conducted by AFOTEC or MAJCOMs in
  preparation for dedicated operational testing and typically support MS C or LRIP decisions.
  They are designed to be progress reports and not intended to determine the overall
  effectiveness or suitability of a system. They provide early operational data and feedback
  from actual testing to developers, users, and decision makers. OAs also provide a progress
  report on the system’s readiness for IOT&E or FDE, or support the assessment of new
  technologies. OAs will not be used as substitutes for IOT&E, QOT&E, FOT&E, FDE, or
  OUE. OAs are integrated with DT&E to:
     2.5.9.1. Assess and report on a system’s maturity and potential to meet operational
     requirements during dedicated operational testing.
     2.5.9.2. Support long-lead, LRIP, or increments of acquisition programs.
     2.5.9.3. Identify deficiencies or design problems that can impact system capability to
     meet concepts of employment, concepts of operation or operational requirements.
     2.5.9.4. Uncover potential system changes needed which in turn may impact operational
     requirements, COIs, or the Acquisition Strategy.
     2.5.9.5. Support the demonstration of prototypes, new technologies, or new applications
     of existing technologies, and demonstrate how well these systems meet mission needs or
     satisfy operational capability requirements.
     2.5.9.6. Support proof of concept initiatives.
     2.5.9.7. Augment or reduce the scope of dedicated operational testing.
AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                       19


   2.5.10. Early Operational Assessment (EOA). EOAs are similar to OAs, except they are
   performed prior to MS B to provide very early assessments of system capabilities and
   programmatic risks. Most EOAs are reviews of existing documentation, but some may
   require hands-on involvement with prototype hardware and/or software.
   2.5.11. Sufficiency of Operational Test Review (SOTR). For some programs of limited
   scope and complexity, system development testing or integrated developmental and
   operational test events may provide adequate test data to support MAJCOM production or
   fielding decisions. In these situations, the lowest appropriate level of required operational
   testing may consist of a review of existing data rather than a separate, dedicated operational
   test event. The ITT should recommend a SOTR when appropriate.
        2.5.11.1. The SOTR will only be accomplished when directed by MAJCOM T&E staff,
        and the reviewing OTO must document that decision. The SOTR may be used as the
        source of operational test information for supporting fielding, acquisition milestone, or
        production decisions. See also paragraph 4.6.6.3. The SOTR may not be used for
        milestone decisions associated with OSD OT&E Oversight programs unless approved by
        the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E).
        2.5.11.2. See paragraph 7.4.5 for reporting SOTR results, and the Air Force T&E
        Guidebook for a comparison with the Capabilities and Limitations (C&L) report.
   2.5.12. Summary of Operational Testing. The key distinctions between types of
   operational testing and the decisions they support are shown in Table 2.1. Note: Table 2.1
   is intended as a summary and may not cover all possible T&E situations; refer to the
   descriptions in paragraph 2.5 or consult with AF/TEP for final guidance of any issues.

2.6. Testing of Training Devices. To ensure crew training devices provide accurate and
credible training throughout their life cycles, AFI 36-2251, Management of Air Force Training
Systems, gives direction and guidance for using the simulator certification (SIMCERT) and
simulator validation (SIMVAL) processes.           Specifically, SIMCERT and SIMVAL are
assessments of training device effectiveness in accomplishing allocated tasks and provide a
comparison of crew training device performance with the prime mission system. In addition,
PMs must include training system concepts and requirements in all acquisition strategies. They
must ensure training systems are fielded concurrently with initial prime mission system fielding,
and remain current throughout the weapon system life cycle IAW AFI 63-101/20-101. See
definitions in Attachment 1.
2.7. Specialized Types of Test and Evaluation. Certain types of T&E require test
organizations to use specialized processes, techniques, requirements, and formats in addition to
those prescribed in this AFI. These specialized types of T&E must be integrated with other T&E
activities as early as possible. These tests often occur during DT&E and OT&E and may have
the characteristics of both. They are often done concurrently with other testing to conserve
resources and shorten schedules, but may also be conducted as stand-alone test activities if
necessary. These tests are usually conducted in operationally relevant environments which
include end-to-end scenarios. Table 2.2 identifies guidance for the PM to use in planning,
conducting, and reporting these specialized types of T&E.

3.16. Chief Developmental Tester (CDT). All MDAPs and MAIS programs are required to
have a CDT IAW 10 U.S.C. § 139b and the USD(AT&L) memo Government Performance of
Critical Acquisition Functions, August 25, 2010. The CDT works for the Program Manager
(PM). For non-MDAP or MAIS programs, the CDT may be called the Test Manager. Note:
When this AFI refers to the CDT, it also includes the Test Manager. While Test Managers
perform essentially the same functions as the CDT, they do not need to meet the more stringent
workforce qualifications of the CDT referenced in paragraph 3.5.5.2. The CDT will:
   3.16.1. Coordinate the planning, management, and oversight of all DT&E activities for the
   program. (T-0)

3.17. Lead Developmental Test and Evaluation Organization (LDTO). The LDTO
(formerly called the RTO) functions as the lead integrator for a program’s DT&E activities. The
LDTO is separate from the program office, but supports the PM and ITT in a provider-customer
relationship with regard to the scope, type, and conduct of required DT&E. Exception: Due to
the long established structure and limited pool of highly specialized technical knowledge in
space systems acquisition, a different LDTO construct is authorized. The PEO for Space may
approve the use of an internal LDTO, provided it is within a separate three-letter division from
the segment three-letter program offices.
AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                      33


The LDTO will: (Note: Paragraphs 3.17.1 through 3.17.3 implement 10 U.S.C. §139b and

3.19. Integrated Test Team (ITT). The ITT will:
   3.19.1. Develop and manage the strategy for T&E and test plans that are integrated to
   effectively support the requirements, acquisition, IA, and sustainment strategies. A single
   ITT may cover multiple related programs such as systems of systems. Program managers
   should not have multiple project-level ITTs within a program, but should create subgroups
   (e.g., TIPTs or working-level groups) that report to the ITT. New programs should consider
   using an existing ITT’s expertise to ensure more efficient start up.
   3.19.2. Develop and implement an ITT charter according to paragraph 4.4. Recommended
   member organizations are listed in paragraph 4.4.4. Coordinate updates to the charter as
   program changes warrant. Note: During the MS A phase or pre MS-A, provisional or
   temporary ITT representatives may be required to initiate the processes cited in paragraph
   4.4.

             T&E ACTIVITIES SUPPORTING MILESTONE A DECISIONS

4.1. Pre-MS A Tester Involvement. The most important activities prior to and during Materiel
Solution Analysis that support a MS A decision are shown in Figure 4.1. This chapter describes
testers’ roles in these activities. Testers need to be involved in multidisciplinary teams
performing developmental planning activities. They must ensure that appropriate T&E
information is provided in a timely manner to support the requirements, acquisition, and IA
processes. This chapter focuses on early team building, strategy development, and establishing
baselines for managing T&E activities in this phase and beyond.

Figure 4.1. Integration of Requirements, Acquisition, IA, and T&E Events Prior to MS A.
 36                                                              AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013


4.2. Pre-MS A Tester Involvement in Requirements Development. Tester involvement starts
with participation in the requirements process described in AFI 10-601, CJCSI 3170.01, the
Manual for the Operation of the Integration and Development System, and CJCSI 6212.01F. As
HPT members, developmental and operational testers support development of the Requirements
Strategy and appropriate requirements documents with technical and operational expertise. HPT
member organizations and procedures are identified at AF/A5RP’s website hosted on the Air
Force Portal (https://www.my.af.mil). Air Force T&E organizations provide support to HPTs.
Testers review Air Force operating and enabling concepts to fully understand how new systems
will be employed and supported. Testers use these documents to support the development of a
strategy for T&E and development of test inputs to RFPs. They also ensure that operational
capability requirements are testable. AF/TE, AFOTEC, and MAJCOM representatives
participate in the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC).
4.3. Pre-MS A Tester Involvement in the Acquisition Process. The MDD review is the
official entry into the acquisition process substantiating the need for a materiel solution based on
a validated capability gap. The MDA may authorize entry into the acquisition process at any
point consistent with phase-specific entrance criteria. The strategy for T&E will be consistent
with this entry point. At this time, a PM should be assigned to lead and fund early study and
collaborative efforts. Early tester involvement helps identify planning and other shortfalls that
could result in increased development, operations, and life cycle costs. Developmental and
operational testers must be involved in the collaborative work that produces the ICD, AoA Study
Plan, MDD, COAs, AoA Final Report, PPP, Acquisition Strategy, Technology Development
Strategy (TDS), TES or strategy for T&E, TEMP or LCSP, and the definition of entrance and
exit criteria for developmental and operational testing. Pre-MS A project or program
documentation must address which test organizations will conduct DT&E and operational testing
as determined from paragraphs 4.4, 4.5, and 4.6.
4.4. Formation of the ITT. An ITT must be formed immediately after MDD so it can help
shape the requirements, acquisition, IA, and strategies for T&E as depicted in Figure 4.1. The
ITT is a decision making body and its members must be empowered to speak for their
organizations. The ITT works together as a cross-functional team to map out the strategy for
testing and evaluating a system. All programs must have an ITT, but a single ITT can cover a
number of closely related programs, such as the modifications and upgrades embedded in a
legacy aircraft program.
   4.4.1. ITT Quick Start. Identifying appropriate ITT organizational membership is critical
   to ensure program stability. During early program phases (e.g., immediately after MDD),
   ITT member organizations must send empowered representatives to assist with requirements
   development, designing the strategy for T&E, selecting the LDTO and OTO, reviewing early
   documentation, developing an initial T&E resources estimate, and other appropriate test
   planning activities as required.
   4.4.2. ITT Leadership. The program office (or the program's initial cadre) takes the lead in
   forming an ITT with representatives from all needed disciplines. As the program office
   forms, the PM or designated T&E representative is assigned to co-chair the ITT with the lead
   OTO. Testers should be proactive in supporting ITT initial formation and goals even though
   they may not be formally tasked before the initial MDD ADM is signed. Testers who
   contributed to the AoA plan or participated in the HPT should form the nucleus of the initial
   ITT.
AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                    37


  4.4.3. ITT Charter. The PM produces a formal, signed ITT charter that describes ITT
  membership, responsibilities, ITT resources, and the products for which the ITT is
  responsible. ITTs may function at two levels: an Executive Level consisting of O-6s and GS-
  15s from key organizations; and a Working Group Level consisting of organizations needed
  to fulfill specific ITT tasks. Organizational representatives no higher than O-6 or GS-15
  coordinate on and sign the ITT charter. See the recommended ITT charter outline and
  guidance in the Air Force T&E Guidebook.
  4.4.4. ITT Membership. The ITT leadership tailors the membership, structure, and
  protocols as necessary to help ensure program success. ITT membership (at the Executive
  Level and Working Group Level) may vary depending on program needs. The ITT should
  include expertise from organizations such as the program office (or the program's initial
  cadre), AFOTEC and/or MAJCOM OTO as appropriate, LDTO and other DT&E
  organizations, the Center or Complex level T&E focal point and engineering function,
  AF/TEP, AF/A3/5, SAF/A6, JITC, OSD, organizations responsible for IA and
  interoperability testing, system and support contractors, developers, lab and S&T
  organizations, intelligence, requirements sponsors, test facilities, and other stakeholders as
  needed during various test program phases. Include representatives from the other Services
  if testing a multi-Service program. Also include the implementing command headquarters
  and Air Education and Training Command, if required.
  4.4.5. ITTs for Interoperable Systems. If a system is dependent on the outcome of other
  acquisition programs, or must provide capabilities to other systems, those dependencies must
  be detailed in the acquisition strategy and other program documentation. The ITT charter
  should reflect those dependencies by including representatives from the other programs as
  needed who can address interoperability testing requirements.
  4.4.6. Subgroups. The ITT charter should direct the formation of subgroups (e.g., TIPTs,
  study groups, review boards) to write test plans and handle specific test issues as needed.
  These subgroups would not require full ITT participation. A “test team” is a group of testers
  and other experts who are responsible for specific test issues or carry out integrated testing
  according to specific test plans. There may be multiple TIPTs and test teams associated with
  an ITT.
  4.4.7. Operational MAJCOM Roles. MAJCOM operational testers are required to
  participate in the ITT at program inception if AFOTEC is not the lead OTO according to
  paragraph 4.6. In these cases, MAJCOM operational testers must assume the ITT co-chair
  position and conduct required operational testing. When AFOTEC is the lead OTO,
  MAJCOM operational testers should participate in the ITT and plan for transition of these
  responsibilities according to paragraph 4.6. TEMPs must reflect this transition.
  4.4.8. Charter Updates. ITT charters are reviewed and updated after each major decision
  review to ensure testing is integrated as much as possible within statutory and regulatory
  guidelines. Changes in membership should reflect the skills required for each phase of the
  program. The ITT’s responsibilities are described in paragraph 3.19
  4.4.9. Integrated Testing. The ITT must begin integrating all T&E activities after MDD, to
  include contractor testing. The TES and TEMP must outline how all testing will be
  integrated, addressing the overall evaluation approach, key evaluation measures, and the
  major risks or limitations to completing the evaluations. State justification for any testing
 38                                                           AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013


   that is not integrated. The TES and TEMP will also include the interfaces and
   interoperability with all other supporting/supported systems described in the system enabling
   and operating concepts, and operational architectures. T&E planners must develop strategies
   for embedded and stand-alone IT sub-systems as well as all IA and security testing. Refer to
   the DAG, Chapter 9, for the recommended TEMP format (https://dag.dau.mil/).
4.5. Determining the LDTO. The LDTO is the lead government DT&E organization
responsible for a program’s DT&E IAW paragraph 3.17 For complex programs, the LDTO may
build a confederation of DT&E organizations with appropriate skill mixes by enlisting the
support of other PTOs as needed. The LDTO serves as the lead integrator and “single-face-to-
the-customer,” working closely with the program’s CDT for purposes of planning, executing and
reporting DT&E. For less complex programs, the LDTO may be solely responsible for
overseeing and/or conducting all or most of the relevant DT&E. In accordance with 10 U.S.C.
§139b and DoDI 5000.02, all MDAPs and MAIS programs will be supported by a government
DT&E organization serving as LDTO. All other Air Force programs will select an LDTO unless
a “no-LDTO” option (only possible for low risk ACAT III programs) is determined to be the best
course of action and is approved in writing by the PEO IAW paragraph 4.5.4.
   4.5.1. LDTO Selection. The ITT initiates selection of an LDTO when building the strategy
   for T&E prior to MS A if possible. LDTO selection must be based on a thorough review of
   required DT&E skill sets and human and capital resources that are best suited and available
   for each program.
   4.5.2. Appropriate LDTO Organizations. HQ AFMC/A3 and HQ AFSPC/A5 will jointly
   develop lists of LDTO qualifications and candidate LDTO organizations. LDTO candidates
   should have experience with the relevant system domain(s) and in leading other
   organizations. During system development, the skills of several developmental test
   organizations may be needed, but only one will be designated as the LDTO. In all cases, the
   confederation of DT&E organizations must be qualified to oversee and/or conduct the
   required DT&E, and be capable of providing objective analysis and judgment. The
   designation as an LDTO does not require all associated DT&E activities to be conducted by
   the LDTO itself or at a single geographic location.
   4.5.3. LDTO Selection Process. The ITT submits their selection to the PM along with a
   capabilities and resource analysis. LDTO nominations will be coordinated with HQ
   AFMC/A3 and/or HQ AFSPC/A5, as appropriate, before submission to the PEO. After the
   PEO approves the selection, the PM notifies HQ AFMC/A3 and/or HQ AFSPC/A5, as
   appropriate, and the program element monitor (PEM) within 30 days. Note: The PEM is the
   person from the Secretariat or Air Staff who has overall responsibility for the program
   element and who harmonizes program documentation.
   4.5.4. No-LDTO Option. An alternate organization may be designated in lieu of an LDTO
   to perform and/or oversee the functions described in paragraph 3.17. The “no-LDTO” option
   will be staffed and coordinated following the same process described in paragraph 4.5.3. The
   “no-LDTO” option is by exception and only authorized for low-risk ACAT III programs.
4.6. Determining the OTO. The OTO for all programs and projects will be determined using
the three-column flow chart in Figure 4.2 The flow chart identifies the responsible (default)
OTO for Air Force acquisition programs based on program ACAT, OSD OT&E Oversight
status, and multi-Service applicability. The flow chart also identifies a process to transfer
AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                  39


operational test responsibilities from MAJCOM test organizations to AFOTEC when requested
by the MAJCOM and accepted by AFOTEC. Any such change must be coordinated with the
PM. The flow chart will be used according to the following paragraphs (references cited in
Figure 4.2).
   4.6.1. Programs Requiring AFOTEC Conduct. As the Air Force OTA, AFOTEC
   conducts operational testing for ACAT I, IA, II, OSD OT&E Oversight, and multi-Service
   acquisition programs as shown in Column 1 of Figure 4.2. AFOTEC also conducts FOT&E
   for programs as described in paragraph 2.5.3 and as shown in Column 2. AFOTEC
   involvement will end at the completion of FOT&E (or I/Q/MOT&E if no FOT&E is
   required) unless AFOTEC and the user MAJCOM otherwise mutually agree and document in
   the TES, TEMP, or other program documentation.
      4.6.1.1. If a program has completed I/Q/MOT&E with deficiencies or shortfalls having
      severe or substantial mission impacts, as identified in the AFOTEC final report,
      AFOTEC normally conducts FOT&E for those deficiencies as shown at the top of
      Column 2. AFOTEC and the appropriate MAJCOM may mutually agree to allow the
      MAJCOM to conduct further testing for mission impacts rated substantial. When these
      post-I/Q/MOT&E programs have no deficiencies with severe or substantial mission
      impacts, the MAJCOM is responsible for continued operational testing.
      4.6.1.2. If a program has modifications, upgrades, etc., that are large enough to be
      considered new acquisition programs, required operational testing will be conducted for
      the new program by the appropriate OTO in accordance with Figure 4.2. In these
      instances, systems normally re-enter the acquisition process at a milestone commensurate
      with the Acquisition Strategy. An additional indicator that a program may warrant
      AFOTEC involvement is the presence of new or revised operational requirements
      documentation validated by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) or
      AFROC. Multi-Service FDE may be assigned to a MAJCOM by mutual agreement with
      AFOTEC.

Figure 4.2. Determining the Operational Test Organization.




   4.6.2. Programs Requiring MAJCOM Conduct. As shown in Column 3, MAJCOM
   OTOs conduct required operational testing for ACAT III programs. MAJCOMs continue
   conducting operational testing for all routine post-I/Q/F/MOT&E fielded system upgrades,
   deficiency corrections, and sustainment programs as required. See paragraph 3.10.1 for lead
   command designation. MAJCOMs may request AFOTEC to assume responsibility for
   operational testing (see paragraph 4.6.3) and/or may request support according to paragraphs
   3.10.16 and 4.6.6.1
   4.6.3. MAJCOM Requests for AFOTEC Re-Involvement. Post-I/Q/MOT&E and -
   FOT&E, MAJCOMs may request that AFOTEC remain involved (or become re-involved) in
   programs that are normally a MAJCOM responsibility (see right side of Column 2). These
   requests must include required documentation (i.e., JCIDS documents, enabling and
   operating concepts, and Acquisition Strategy) needed for AFOTEC to make an informed
   involvement decision. AFOTEC uses a repeatable, documented process with clearly defined
   criteria to determine post-I/Q/MOT&E or post-FOT&E involvement. AFOTEC documents
   their decision and provide timely notification to the HQ MAJCOM T&E OPR and AF/TEP.
   If the response time exceeds 30 days, AFOTEC informs the MAJCOM on the reason for
   delay. Acceptance of test responsibility also means providing funds for test execution
   according to operational test funding guidance in AFI 65-601, Vol I, Chapter 14.
   4.6.4. Some acquisition program schedules may require MAJCOM testing of follow-on
   modifications, preplanned product improvements, and upgrades simultaneously with planned
   AFOTEC FOT&E. In these instances, AFOTEC and operational MAJCOM testers
   coordinate through the ITT on the most efficient strategy for completing the required testing.
AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                   41


  4.6.5. AFOTEC Requests to Transfer OT&E Responsibilities.
     4.6.5.1. AFOTEC requests to transfer any operational test responsibilities should be
     coordinated and resolved not later than 18 months prior to the first scheduled or required
     operational test event. Transfer of operational test responsibilities less than 18 months
     prior to test start may only be done by mutual agreement of all parties and AF/TE
     concurrence.
     4.6.5.2. In some cases, operational testing for an AFOTEC-supported program in Figure
     4.2, Column 1, may be more appropriately executed by a MAJCOM OTO. If both
     AFOTEC and the MAJCOM(s) mutually agree, AFOTEC requests an exception to policy
     from AF/TEP. The request must include whether the program is on OSD OT&E
     Oversight, the ACAT level, phase of program development, rationale for the change, any
     special conditions, and written MAJCOM concurrence.
  4.6.6. Miscellaneous Provisions.
     4.6.6.1. Despite having a designated lead command per AFPD 10-9, some ACAT III,
     non-OSD Oversight programs support multiple users with differing requirements across
     an entire AF-wide enterprise area. The lead MAJCOM and AFOTEC will negotiate an
     OT&E involvement role per Column 3 of Figure 4.2, or coordinate with appropriate HQ
     MAJCOM T&E OPR for a multi-MAJCOM/AFOTEC test approach.
     4.6.6.2. Some programs may not be clearly “owned” by a MAJCOM or sponsor with an
     organic operational test function. In these cases, the program’s sponsor coordinates with
     AFOTEC to identify an appropriate OTO, with respective MAJCOM concurrence, to
     complete any required operational testing. If an appropriate OTO cannot be identified,
     the sponsor contacts AF/TE for guidance.
     4.6.6.3. If the OTO and lead HQ MAJCOM T&E OPR jointly agree that no operational
     testing is necessary, the LDTO provides relevant DT&E data that supports the option to
     not conduct operational testing. The OTO reviews the LDTO’s work, assess the risk of
     accepting that work, and document their assessment with a SOTR according to
     paragraphs 2.5.11 and 7.4.5.
     4.6.6.4. Multiple OTOs. If multiple OTOs within the Air Force are tasked to conduct
     testing concurrently, the ITT must be notified before planning begins and a lead OTO is
     designated. All operational test plans must be reviewed by, and reports coordinated with,
     the lead OTO to ensure continuity of effort. This information must be updated in the
     TEMP, test plans, and other documentation when appropriate. For OSD OT&E
     Oversight programs, the lead OTO complies with all Oversight requirements according to
     Attachment 2.
  4.6.7. Operational Test Coordination Meeting. AF/TEP chairs an AFOTEC-MAJCOM
  operational test coordination meeting prior to annual POM development and submission to
  establish clear test leadership and resourcing responsibilities. When necessary, these
  meetings should occur in the August to September timeframe in the year before the POM is
  finalized. Operational test schedules projected five years ahead for all MAJCOM weapons
  systems will be reviewed. Program ITTs are expected to resolve as many issues and
  disconnects as possible before this meeting. Expected lead OTOs should be identified at
 42                                                             AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013


   least 18-24 months prior to projected test start dates to ensure that responsible organizations
   plan for adequate test resources.
4.7. OSD T&E Oversight and Approval. DOT&E and DASD(DT&E) jointly publish a list of
acquisition and sustainment programs requiring OSD T&E Oversight and monitoring. The
master list has sub-parts for DT&E, LFT&E, and OT&E. Programs may appear in one or more
sub-parts. PMs and CDTs must determine as early as possible if their program is on this list due
to additional workload and reporting requirements.
   4.7.1. Additional Workload and Reporting. Continuous coordination with the assigned
   DASD(DT&E) and DOT&E action officers is required for programs on OSD T&E
   Oversight. ITTs should invite OSD action officers to ITT meetings and decision reviews,
   and coordinate draft TEMPs, test plans, and other program-related documentation as the
   program unfolds. Attachment 2 contains a succinct summary of information requirements.
       4.7.1.1. Selected DT&E plans and acquisition documents for programs on OSD DT&E
       Oversight may require DASD(DT&E) review and/or approval. DASD(DT&E) may
       require a test concept briefing for selected test programs. PMs and LDTOs will respond
       promptly to requests for DT&E plans, test concept briefings, or other T&E
       documentation.
       4.7.1.2. When LFT&E is required for “covered systems” IAW 10 U.S.C. § 2366, these
       programs are placed on the LFT&E part of the OSD T&E Oversight list. PEOs must
       continually review their portfolios for any programs “covered” under 10 U.S.C. § 2366.
       The PM is responsible to help identify these programs. DOT&E approval of the LFT&E
       plan is required before commencing tests. In certain cases, LFT&E waivers are
       appropriate and must be obtained before MS B. See details in paragraph 5.8.4.
       4.7.1.3. Operational testing for programs on OSD OT&E Oversight may not start until
       DOT&E approves the adequacy of the test plans in writing. DOT&E requires approval
       of EOAs, OAs, OUEs, and OT&E plans, and requires a test concept briefing 180 days
       prior to test start for each of these plans. For test plans that are integrated, DOT&E
       approval is only required on the operational test portions prior to the start of operational
       testing. See paragraphs 6.6 and 6.7 for more details about DOT&E’s requirements.
   4.7.2. Coordination Prior to Approval. Program offices and OTOs (as appropriate) will
   route DT&E, LFT&E, operational test plans (e.g., EOA, OA, and IOT&E), and test concepts
   requiring OSD approval through AF/TEP before submission to OSD. AF/TEP will assist
   with the review, coordination, and submission of these documents.
   4.7.3. OSD Oversight Programs with Multiple Subparts. Some T&E Oversight
   programs, although listed as a single entity, have multiple subparts, each with its own set of
   test planning and reporting requirements to satisfy OSD’s statutory obligations. OSD
   representatives to the ITT should identify which subparts are relieved of these requirements.
   In addition, some OSD Oversight programs may use or consist of components from non-
   OSD Oversight programs. As a result, these components may be subject to OSD test plan
   approval and reporting. The ITT co-chairs document the subcomponents that should be
   under OSD Oversight and notify AF/TEP and the PEO.
   4.7.4. OSD Oversight List Updates. The most current lists are maintained at
   https://extranet.dote.osd.mil/pub/oversight.html. They are frequently updated and new
AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                       43


   programs are added without official notice. Contact AF/TEP for more information about the
   most current list. All test organizations should forward recommended additions or deletions
   to AF/TEP.
   4.7.5. Interoperability Watch List. The Joint Staff Command, Control, Communications,
   & Computers/Cyber (JCS/J6) may track and place any IT or NSS with significant
   interoperability deficiencies, or that is not making significant progress toward achieving Joint
   Interoperability Test Certification, on the Interoperability Watch List. Listed programs may
   transition to the OSD T&E Oversight List.
4.8. Lead Service Considerations. When the Air Force is designated the lead Service for
multi-Service T&E, the ITT will document the other Services’ T&E responsibilities, resources,
and methods to eliminate conflicts and duplication. When the Air Force is not the lead Service,
Air Force testers follow the lead Service’s T&E policies. See the DAG and the MOA on
MOT&E and JTE (http://www.dote.osd.mil/policy.html) for more information.
4.9. Tester Inputs During Materiel Solution Analysis (MSA). Developmental and
operational testers must assist requirements sponsors, acquisition planners, and systems
engineers in developing AoAs, COAs, and TDSs. Testers provide T&E inputs for each
alternative developed. Criteria, issues, COIs, CTPs, measures of effectiveness (MOE), and
measures of suitability (MOS) developed for these documents are later used for developing the
strategy for T&E and subsequent T&E plans.
4.10. Developing Test Measures. During the MSA phase, developmental and operational
testers should begin drafting clear, realistic, and testable measures to support the strategy for
T&E or TES, the MS A decision, and future test plans. These measures are refined and evolve
as more information becomes available during and after the MSA phase. DT&E practitioners
assist systems engineers in developing critical system characteristics (i.e., CTPs) that when
achieved, allow the attainment of operational performance requirements. Operational testers
draft COIs, MOEs, MOSs for operational testing purposes. The goal is to ensure all measures
are traceable to key system requirements and architectures, and correlate to the KPPs and Key
System Attributes (KSA). These measures guide the PM when writing system specifications for
contractual purposes. The best way to ensure complete coverage and correlation is to list them in
an Evaluation Framework Matrix that becomes part of the first TEMP.
4.11. Test and Evaluation Strategy (TES) Development. The TES documents the overall
structure and objectives of the program’s T&E activities in support of MS A. It provides a
framework within which to generate future T&E plans, and begin scheduling key resources
associated with the T&E program.
   4.11.1. ITT members develop the TES to support MS A in accordance with the DAG,
   Chapter 9, and DoDI 5000.02, Enclosure 6. DASD(DT&E) and DOT&E approve the TES at
   MS A for OSD T&E Oversight programs; the designated MDA is the approval authority for
   all other programs. Although minimal detail is available early in new programs, the TES
   must contain an overarching “strategy for T&E” and an initial ITC. TES development and
   coordination follow the same process as the TEMP as described in paragraph 5.14.
   4.11.2. While a TES is mandatory for MDAP and MAIS programs, other programs not using
   a TES must articulate a “strategy for T&E” at MS A. The strategy for T&E is a high-level
   conceptual outline of all T&E required to support development and sustainment of an
 44                                                            AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013


   acquisition program. Programs that do not develop a TES may use an LCSP in lieu of a TES
   as described in paragraph 5.15. The TES and LCSP may use best-available estimates and
   projections of the program’s T&E requirements.
   4.11.3. The ITC outlines the flow of all T&E activities and requirements, and integrates
   them for the next acquisition phases. Feasible test approaches that support the requirements,
   acquisition, and IA strategies, and to a limited extent, the production and sustainment
   strategy, must be projected. The TES (or strategy for T&E) and the ITC must plan to take
   maximum advantage of existing investments in DoD ranges and facilities. Paragraph 1.3.5
   describes additional topics for inclusion.
   4.11.4. The TES must describe feasible test approaches for the selected COA option(s) based
   on the ICD, PPP, and enabling and operating concepts. It outlines initial T&E designs,
   objectives, and T&E resource requirements. Developmental testers assist systems engineers
   in drafting CTPs that are testable. Operational testers, in conjunction with MAJCOM
   requirements and T&E offices, develop COIs in the form of questions to be answered during
   evaluation of a system’s overall effectiveness and suitability. They also draft the MOEs and
   MOSs. A series of OAs should be integrated into the T&E continuum to reduce program risk
   and minimize the overall number of test events.
   4.11.5. The CDT functions as the "lead DT&E integrator" for contracting matters, and
   interfacing as needed with all other representatives on the ITT. The CDT ensures all
   necessary organizations with specialized skills contribute to TES development. The
   integrated test planning process culminates in a TES or LCSP that includes an initial
   description of test scenarios, test measures (e.g., CTPs, MOEs, and MOSs), test locations,
   exercises, T&E methodologies, operational impacts and issues, contractor contributions, and
   projections for future capabilities.
   4.11.6. The MS A-approved TES becomes the foundation for the TEMP which is described
   throughout Chapter 5 and paragraph 6.2
4.12. Reliability Growth Planning. Planning for reliability starts with testers participating in
HPTs to help ensure operational reliability requirements are correctly written, reflect realistic
conditions, and are testable. Testers work with the program's systems engineers in the allocation
of reliability among critical components, determining the amount of testing and resources
required, and developing the plan for improving reliability as development progresses. These
items, among others, are necessary when designing the system and the test program. They are
outlined in the TEMP, SEP, and LCSP. Also see AFI 63-101/20-101; the DoD Guide for
Achieving Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability; and DOT&E memo, Procedure for
Assessment of Reliability Programs by DOT&E Action Officers, 29 May 09.
4.13. Pre-Milestone A Planning for T&E Resources.
   4.13.1. Securing T&E Ranges and Facilities. Test planners must contact potential test
   sites early to obtain estimates of costs, availability, and test priority. Test planners should
   ascertain how each range or site establishes priorities among programs on that range, and
   what to submit to gain access. HQ AFMC/A3, HQ AFSPC/A3/5, or HQ ACC/A3 and the
   range or facility points of contact (POC) will provide information and assistance on using the
   Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) and other government test facilities. See AFI
   99-109, Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) Test and Evaluation Resource
AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                     45


  Planning. See AFI 13-212, Range Planning and Operations, for information on the use of
  test and training ranges. The USAF T&E Organizations and Facilities Database on the
  AF/TEP page of the Air Force Portal (https://www.my.af.mil) provides information about
  the capabilities of available Air Force test facilities, capabilities, and other resources.
  4.13.2. Use of Government Test Facilities. The ITT will plan to take full advantage of
  existing investments in DoD ranges, facilities, and other resources, including the use of
  embedded instrumentation. For Air Force programs, test teams should plan to use Air Force
  test capabilities first, followed by other MRTFB facilities, followed by other military Service
  and non-DoD government facilities (including Federally Funded Research and Development
  Corporation (FFRDC) test resources), and finally contractor facilities. This hierarchy does
  not mean that all T&E facilities used by a program must be from a single category;
  combinations of contractor and government facilities may provide the best business case and
  should be considered.
  4.13.3. Use of Non-Government Facilities. During test planning development, the ITT
  should consider contractor test facilities only when government facilities are not available,
  cannot be modified, or are too expensive. If the strategy for T&E calls for testing at non-
  government facilities, the PM must conduct a business case analysis that includes facility life
  cycle sustainment costs for all COAs. Analyze COAs that include teaming arrangements
  with other programs using the same facilities on a cost-sharing basis. Include these facility
  requirements in the EMD RFP and document the final choice with rationale in the TEMP.
  The T&E resource strategy must be cost-efficient as well as flexible.
  4.13.4. Use of Exercises and Experiments. To the maximum practical extent, the
  USAFWC assists Air Force test organizations in gaining access to exercises and experiments
  to take advantage of operationally realistic environments, high threat densities, massed
  forces, and other efficiencies. Test organizations should plan to participate in joint and
  Service experiments and war games as appropriate. The goals of the exercise, experiment, or
  T&E activity must be compatible; some tailoring may be required to ensure all stakeholders
  benefit from the activity.
  4.13.5. Planning for Testing in a Joint Environment. All planning for testing must be
  structured to reflect the joint environment and missions in which the system will operate.
  ITT members should consider use of distributed test methodologies with live, virtual, and
  constructive simulation resources such as Air Force Integrated Collaborative Environment
  (AF ICE) sites, Joint Mission Environment Test Capability (JMETC), and the Joint
  Information Operations Range. See DoD’s Testing in a Joint Environment Roadmap at
  https://acc.dau.mil/t&e.
  4.13.6. Planning for Target and Instrumented Munitions Expenditures. Test
  organizations, in consultation with PMs, will plan for aerial target requirements IAW AFI
  99-108, Programming and Reporting Aerial Target and Missile Expenditures in Test and
  Evaluation. Test organizations and PMs must forecast their requirements for munitions
  flight termination and telemetry kits IAW AFI 99-120, Forecasting and Programming
  Munitions Telemetry and Flight Termination Systems.
  4.13.7. Planning for Foreign Materiel Resources. ITT members should consult with
  requirements, acquisition, and intelligence organizations to determine the need for foreign
  materiel resources.
 46                                                                      AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013


4.14. Testing IT and Defense Business Systems (DBS). Testing of IT and DBS programs
presents many unique challenges not common to hardware intensive systems. The PM must
ensure that any specialized tests (e.g., IA and interoperability), and correction of any deficiencies
with mission impacts, are addressed as early as possible prior to IA and interoperability
certification decision milestone dates. AF/A3/5 must ensure current operational requirements
and operating or enabling concepts are available to support the applicable phases of T&E. The
following memos contain further guidance and apply to all IT and DBS programs:
   4.14.1. DOT&E memo, Guidelines for Operational Test and Evaluation of Information and
   Business Systems, Sept 14, 2010.
   4.14.2. USD(AT&L) memo, Interim Acquisition Guidance for Defense Business Systems
   (DBS), Nov 15, 2010.
   4.14.3. DOT&E memo, Procedures for Operational Test and Evaluation of Information
   Assurance in Acquisition Programs, Jan 21, 2009.
   4.14.4. DTM 11-009, Acquisition Policy for Defense Business Systems (DBS) incorporating
   Change 2, 10 Jan 2013.
4.15. Testing of Urgent Needs. Expedited testing and reporting is required for urgent needs
(e.g., Urgent Operational Need (UON), Joint Emergent Operational Need (JEON), or Joint
Urgent Operational Need (JUON)) using the Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) process in AFI
63-114. A QRC-IPT is created for and manages these systems. OSD-managed Rapid Reaction
Fund (RRF) and Quick Reaction Fund (QRF) programs also accelerate fielding of rapidly
emerging capabilities and concepts. Levels of risk acceptance will be higher and timelines much
shorter than normal in order to satisfy urgent needs. Therefore, testers must be very familiar
with the processes in AFI 63-114 due to the extensive amount of tailoring and streamlining
required. T&E results are generally reported with a Capabilities and Limitations (C&L) Report
according to paragraph 7.5. After initial system fielding, if the QRC will be further developed as
an enduring program, the PEO may require the program to complete the traditional acquisition,
requirements, T&E, and C&A processes for any unfinished areas.
4.16. Additional Early Planning Considerations. PMs and T&E practitioners need toconsider
the topics in Table 4.1 prior to MS A during development of the strategy for T&E or TES.
Although details are not required until after MS A, early strategic planning for these items
streamlines later activities. The ITT should locate qualified personnel to develop and manage
these future topics. Chapter 5 contains the details.

            T&E ACTIVITIES SUPPORTING MILESTONE B DECISIONS

5.1. Post MS A. The most important activities after the MS A decision and during the
Technology Development phase are shown in Figure 5.1. Sustained, high quality tester
involvement and collaboration with requirements sponsors and system developers must continue
throughout the Technology Development phase in preparation for the next phase, EMD. T&E
practitioners continue expanding and developing the topics described in Chapter 4. They must
address new topics added in this chapter, continue refining the strategy for T&E, and begin
building specific, executable T&E plans that support the requirements, acquisition, and IA
processes.

Figure 5.1. Integration of Requirements, Acquisition, IA, and T&E Events Prior to MS B.
AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                         49



5.2. T&E Funding Sources. The funding sources for T&E depend on the nature and purpose of
the work and the type of testing. Funding is not based on the organization conducting the test or
the name of the test. Detailed guidance is in DoD 7000.14-R, Vol 2A, Chapter 1, and AFI 65-
601, Vol 1, Chapter 14. Test resource advisors must ensure compliance with these documents
before requesting and committing funds. Direct assistance is available from SAF/FMBI,
SAF/AQXR, and AF/TEP/TER.
5.3. Formal Contractual Documents. Developmental testers review the System Requirements
Document (SRD) to ensure it correctly links and translates the CDD (draft or final, as
appropriate) into system specifications that can be put on contract. MIL-HDBK-520, Systems
Requirements Document Guidance, provides guidance on translating capability based
requirements into system requirements. ITT members review the RFP and SOW for EMD to
ensure contractor support to government T&E is included and properly described. For guidance,
use DASD(DT&E)’s guide, Incorporating Test and Evaluation into Department of Defense
Acquisition Contracts. The ITT reviews the Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) to ensure
it describes the content, format, delivery instructions, and approval and acceptance criteria for all
deliverable T&E data. The ITT confirms that sufficient funding is provided for all T&E-related
resources. The ITT also reviews these drafts to ensure user-defined capabilities have been
accurately translated into system specifications and provisions are made for the following:
   5.3.1. Government review and approval of contractor test plans and procedures before tests
   commence.
   5.3.2. Government insight into contractor testing to ensure systems are maturing as planned,
   to include government observation of contractor testing.
   5.3.3. Proper interface of the contractor’s DR system with the government’s DR system,
   including T.O. 00-35D-54 compliant processes and methodologies, and portability of data
   into government information management systems.
   5.3.4. Contractor T&E support such as failure analyses, T&E data collection and
   management, operation of unique test equipment, provision of product support, and test
   reports.
   5.3.5. Contractor participation in government test planning forums such as the ITT.
   5.3.6. Contractor provision of training to testers and provision of long-lead items.
5.4. Limitations on Contractor Involvement in Operational Testing. DoDI 5000.02 places
limits on contractor involvement in IOT&E of MDAPs. Air Force policy applies these
limitations to all OT&E programs regardless of ACAT.
   5.4.1. System Contractors. Operational testers must strictly avoid situations where system
   contractors could reduce the credibility of operational test results or compromise the realistic
   accomplishment of operational test scenarios. Contractor personnel may only participate in
   OT&E of Air Force programs to the extent they are planned to be involved in the operation,
   maintenance, and other support of the system when deployed in combat.
   5.4.2. System Contractor Support to Operational Testing. System contractors may be
   beneficial in providing logistic support and training, test failure analyses, test data, and
   unique software and instrumentation support that could increase the value of operational test
 50                                                            AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013


   data. Explanations of how this contractor support will be used and the mitigation of possible
   adverse effects must be described in the TEMP and developmental and operational test plans.
   5.4.3. Support Contractors. According to DoDI 5000.02 and Air Force policy, support
   contractors may not be involved in the establishment of criteria for data collection,
   performance assessment, or evaluation activities for operational testing. This limitation does
   not apply to a support contractor that has participated in such development, production, or
   testing solely in test or test support on behalf of the government.
5.5. Testing IT and DBS. As Agile Development concepts and methods are incorporated into
DoD policy, the ITT must tailor the strategy for T&E to suit program needs. Agile methods
break tasks into small increments, use minimal documentation, are tolerant of changing
requirements, and have iterations typically lasting from a few weeks to a few months. The
emphasis is on software that works as the primary measure of progress. The strategy for
developmental T&E on ASD systems should likewise test small increments, consolidating test
planning into an overarching test plan of the entire capability, with focused annexes for tests of
incremental capability. Testers must maintain early and recurring involvement with the program
office, developer, and users to manage requirements, and should minimize reporting to focus on
the incremental progress. While efforts should be made during developmental testing to
approximate an operational environment, no formal operational testing should be performed until
the final increment is complete to deliver a usable capability to the operational environment.
   5.5.1. The ITT ensures the IT tests described in Table 2.2 are integrated into the ISP, SEP,
   TEMP, contracts, and relevant test plans where and when appropriate.
   5.5.2. Use the DOT&E and USD(AT&L) memos cited in paragraph 4.14 to determine the
   risk assessment level of test (RALOT) in these systems.
5.6. Modeling and Simulation (M&S) in Support of T&E. Plan to use verified, validated,
accredited, and reusable M&S tools and DSMs from the Air Force Modeling and Simulation
Resource Repository (AFMSRR) before building new M&S resources. Early definition of M&S
requirements helps ensure supporting intelligence and modeling efforts have sufficient time to
gather information, allocate assets for threat modeling, and check concurrent efforts in existing
programs. Check the Air Force Agency for Modeling and Simulation (AFAMS) website at
http://www.afams.af.mil/. The PM documents how M&S supports integrated testing in the
Modeling and Simulation Support Plan and the TEMP. For additional policies on using M&S,
see AFI 16-1001, Verification, Validation, and Accreditation (VV&A), and AFI 63-101/20-101.
5.7. Pre-MS B DT&E Planning.
   5.7.1. Planning for Integrated Testing. Integrated testing is the preferred approach unless
   it can be shown that it adds unacceptable costs, delays, or technical risks. The ITT and test
   teams continue refining the ITC initially developed in the TES prior to MS A. The ITC
   supports development of test plans that are integrated and that cover as many developmental,
   operational, and IA test objectives as possible prior to dedicated operational testing. The ITT
   integrates operational test events throughout DT&E to provide additional test realism,
   decrease overall duplication of effort, increase test efficiency, and identify performance
   shortfalls that could result in increased development costs. Multiple sets of test objectives
   will be accomplished together within statutory and regulatory guidelines. DT&E activities
AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                     51


  can overlap and share T&E resources with OAs to conserve resources and extract maximum
  amounts of data.
     5.7.1.1. Use the systems engineering approach in the SEP to break down, identify, and
     integrate the COIs, CTPs, test objectives, MOEs, MOSs, measures of performance
     (MOP), resources, and schedules, which are documented as part of the ITC. When
     appropriate, scientific test and analysis techniques (STAT) and methodologies (as
     described in paragraph 5.13) will also be used. Existing safety review processes will not
     be compromised. See paragraphs 1.3 and 6.2 through 6.4.
     5.7.1.2. Test approaches must be flexible and efficient, especially in areas long held to
     require rigid structural control. Traditional limits such as frozen baselines for the
     duration of OT&E, concurrent development, data merging, using other testers’ validated
     data, and statistical confidence when using small sample sizes should be carefully
     reviewed so they do not become impediments. However, the overarching goals of any
     test should not be compromised. After thorough analysis, test planners may conclude
     that some test activities (e.g., the dedicated portions of OT&E) should not be combined.
     5.7.1.3. While planning for integrated testing, both operational suitability and operational
     effectiveness should be given commensurate consideration. See AFPAM 63-128,
     Attachment 6, and DoD Guide for Achieving Reliability, Availability, and
     Maintainability.
     5.7.1.4. Any test limitations or deferrals resulting from integrating test events must be
     explained in test plans and the TEMP. See paragraph 5.20.
  5.7.2. Requesting Operational MAJCOM Support for DT&E. Requests for operational
  MAJCOM test support for DT&E must be vetted through the appropriate MAJCOM
  headquarters T&E office before they may be accepted. Operational and/or implementing
  MAJCOM headquarters’ review and approval is required depending on the nature of the
  request.
     5.7.2.1. Air Force program offices and/or developmental test organizations may request
     operational MAJCOM (i.e., non-test coded unit) support for DT&E activities only after
     obtaining concurrence from that organization's MAJCOM headquarters T&E office.
     Such test support will be restricted to low-risk military/operational utility evaluations
     under the direct supervision of an LDTO. These activities will be called "DT&E Assists"
     to indicate they are not operational testing.
     5.7.2.2. Air Force program offices and developmental test organizations may request
     MAJCOM OTO support for DT&E activities (including acquisition/sustainment
     programs or proof-of-concept activities where no formal DT&E is planned) only after
     obtaining concurrence from the operational MAJCOM headquarters T&E office. Such
     test support should normally be restricted to low-risk DT&E activities. The requesting
     office must ensure that all applicable technical and safety reviews are completed and
     accepted by the appropriate implementing MAJCOM test approval authorities. The
     technical and safety review and approval documentation will be provided to the OTO
     before test execution may commence.
     5.7.2.3. Requests for operational MAJCOM test support from non-Air Force
     organizations (e.g., Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) must first be
 52                                                             AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013


      forwarded to the implementing MAJCOM headquarters T&E office (AFMC/A3 or
      AFSPC/A5 as appropriate) for review, approval, and assignment of an LDTO. All
      applicable technical and safety reviews must be completed and documentation provided
      before such requests may be accepted by the operational MAJCOM. Only OTO units
      may conduct operational MAJCOM test support for non-Air Force organizations. The
      implementing MAJCOM’s technical and safety reviews may determine that the risk level
      requires testing be conducted by a developmental test organization.
      5.7.2.4. The USAF T&E Organizations and Facilities Database on the AF/TEP portion
      of the AF Portal (https://www.my.af.mil) provides information to PMs on the
      capabilities of available AF test resources.
5.8. LFT&E Planning. The following paragraphs supplement statutory direction in 10 U.S.C. §
2366. The DAG, Chapter 9, provides additional guidance for implementing LFT&E legislation
and OSD requirements.
   5.8.1. Implementation. LFT&E results must support system design and production
   decisions for covered systems. The focus and funding for LFT&E should be on the system
   components immediately related to the development or modification program, but the
   resultant evaluation must be at the system level. PMs should contact the appropriate LFT&E
   test organization in the 96 Test Wing (i.e., 780 Test Squadron for munitions and 96 Test
   Group/OL-AC for survivability of covered systems) for assistance with development of
   LFT&E strategies, plans, waivers, and alternative plans.
   5.8.2. Determining Covered System or Major Munitions Program Status. The PM and
   ITT must first determine if their system is a “covered system,” “major munitions program,”
   or “covered product improvement program.” PEOs must continually review their portfolios
   for any programs “covered” under 10 U.S.C. § 2366. When a potential LFT&E candidate is
   identified, the ITT, PM, appropriate LFT&E organization, and AF/TEP must be notified as
   early as possible. The appropriate LFT&E organization can facilitate discussions to help
   determine a corporate Air Force position and develop a recommendation to DOT&E.
   5.8.3. LFT&E Strategy Approval. As soon as an affirmative determination of covered
   status is made, the PM develops a LFT&E strategy with the assistance of the appropriate
   LFT&E organization. The PM is responsible for communicating and coordinating the
   LFT&E strategy with DOT&E and determining the appropriate method. The strategy must
   be structured so design deficiencies uncovered during EMD may be corrected before
   proceeding beyond LRIP. Technology projects meeting the statutory criteria are also
   required to undergo LFT&E. The ITT describes the LFT&E strategy and plans in the TEMP.
   LFT&E must be fully integrated into the continuum of testing. SAF/AQ will approve the
   LFT&E strategy before it is forwarded to DOT&E for final approval.
   5.8.4. Requests for LFT&E Waivers. The Secretary of Defense may waive the application
   of the survivability and lethality tests of this section to a covered system, munitions program,
   missile program, or covered product improvement program if the Secretary determines that
   live-fire testing of such system or program would be “unreasonably expensive and
   impractical” and submits a certification of that determination to Congress either (a) before
   MS B approval for the system or program; or (b) in the case of a system or program initiated
   at (i) MS B, as soon as is practicable after the MS B approval; or (ii) MS C, as soon as is
   practicable after the MS C approval. To support this determination, the ITT and/or PM will
AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                      53


   submit the LFT&E waiver request and alternative strategy to SAF/AQ for Service-level
   approval. After SAF/AQ approval, the LFT&E waiver request and alternative strategy are
   forwarded to DOT&E for alternative strategy approval, and then together to USD(AT&L) for
   waiver approval. Upon final OSD approval, DOT&E issues a report and formal certification
   to Congress. Document the LFT&E waiver and alternative LFT&E strategy in an annex to
   the TEMP.
   5.8.5. Alternative LFT&E Strategy. The alternative strategy does not alleviate the
   statutory requirement for survivability or lethality testing. The alternative strategy must
   include LFT&E of components, subassemblies, and/or subsystems which, when combined
   with M&S and combat data analysis, will result in confidence in the survivability (or
   lethality) of the system.
   5.8.6. Alternative Strategy and Testing for Major Modifications. In the case of major
   modifications or new production variants, the alternative LFT&E strategy and detailed plans
   must focus on configuration changes that could significantly affect survivability or lethality.
   Potential interactions between portions of the configuration that are changed and those that
   are not changed must be assessed. The assessment results must include a whole system
   analysis of the survivability and vulnerability impacts on the total system. Alternative
   LFT&E are not required on components or subsystems unrelated to the modification
   program.
   5.8.7. Detailed LFT&E Plans. DOT&E reviews and approves all LFT&E plans prior to
   commencement of LFT&E. All LFT&E must be completed and test reports submitted 45
   calendar days before the beyond-LRIP decision review. The DAG lists the mandatory
   contents of LFT&E plans.
   5.8.8. Warfighter Survivability. An assessment of force protection equipment and
   warfighter survivability will also be conducted as required IAW 10 U.S.C. § 139(b)(3),
   Public Law (P.L.) 108-375 § 141, and DoDI 5000.02.
5.9. Early Operational Assessment (EOA) Planning and Execution. During the Technology
Development phase, EOAs are conducted as required to provide operational inputs to
requirements and system developers prior to MS B. The EOA supports development of the
Capability Development Document (CDD), test concepts and plans, and the MS B decision. The
scope and content of EOAs should be tailored to ascertain if the program is on track using any
available data. For programs on DOT&E oversight, EOAs will require DOT&E approval before
they can start. EOAs can be collaborative efforts conducted concurrently with DT&E, and need
not be independently conducted; however, results must be independently assessed.
5.10. Tester Involvement in Requirements Documentation. Testers must continue assisting
requirements sponsors in refining operational capability requirements (e.g., CDD, CPD) and
enabling and operating concepts IAW AFI 10-601. Developmental and operational testers
participate in HPTs by providing technical and operational expertise, lessons learned, and data
from EOAs, prototypes, and integrated testing. Testers help ensure system KPPs, KSAs, and
CTPs are attainable, testable, and accurately expressed in SRDs, RFPs, and SOWs.
5.11. Critical Technical Parameters (CTP). Systems engineers, assisted by DT&E
practitioners, are responsible for developing CTPs. CTPs are measurable, critical system
characteristics that, when achieved, allow the attainment of operational performance
 54                                                              AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013


requirements. They are selected from the technical performance measures (TPM) on the critical
path to achieving the system’s technical goals. Failure to achieve a CTP during DT&E should be
considered a reliable indicator that the system is behind in the planned development schedule, or
will likely not achieve an operational requirement.
   5.11.1. Developmental testers must help ensure CTPs are measurable and testable, traceable
   to key system requirements and architectures, and help the PM translate them into system
   specifications for contractual purposes.
   5.11.2. CTPs must reflect the system’s definition and design for all elements such as
   hardware components, software, architectures, information assurance, personnel, facilities,
   support equipment, reliability and maintainability, and data. CTPs will be correlated to COIs
   and OT&E test objectives (i.e., MOEs and MOSs) in the TEMP. The best way to ensure
   complete coverage and correlation is to list them in the Evaluation Framework Matrix in the
   TEMP.
5.12. Testing COTS, NDI, and GFE. PMs plan for and conduct T&E of COTS, NDI, and GFE
even when these items come from pre-established sources. The operational effectiveness and
suitability, of these items and any military-unique applications must be tested and evaluated
before a FRP or fielding decision. The ITT should plan to take maximum advantage of pre-
existing T&E data to reduce the scope and cost of government testing. More information is
available in USD(AT&L)’s handbook SD-2, Buying Commercial & Non-developmental Items: A
Handbook, available at http://www.dsp.dla.mil/. IT and NSS should be tested IAW DoDI
8500.2,CJCSI 6212.01F, and JAFAN 6/3 (if applicable).
5.13. Scientific Test and Analysis Techniques (STAT). Whenever feasible and consistent
with available resources, STAT should be used for designing and executing tests, and for
analyzing the subsequent test data. The top-level approach must be described in the first
issuance of the TEMP and the SEP at Milestone B, and in more detail in subsequent test plans as
appropriate. The conceptual test designs themselves need not be part of the TEMP or the SEP,
but shall be available for review during coordination of those documents. The ITT should
consult a STAT practitioner whenever test designs are considered.
   5.13.1. The selected approach must address the following areas as a minimum:
       5.13.1.1. Define the objective(s) of the test (or series of tests, when appropriate).
       5.13.1.2. Identify the information required from the test to meet the test objective(s).
       5.13.1.3. Identify the important variables that must be measured to obtain the data
       required for analysis. Identify how those variables will be measured and controlled.
       Identify the analysis technique(s) to be used.
       5.13.1.4. Identify the test points required and justify their placement in the test space to
       maximize the information obtained from the test.
       5.13.1.5. If using a traditional hypothesis test for data analysis, calculate statistical
       measures of merit (power and confidence level) for the relevant response variables for the
       selected number of test events. If using another statistical analysis technique, indicate
       what statistical measures of merit will be used. If a statistical analysis technique is not
       being used, discuss the analysis technique that is being used and provide rationale.
AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                     55


   5.13.2. The selected test design(s) should help ensure smoother, more efficient integration of
   all types of testing up to and including FOT&E. In all cases, the PM is responsible for the
   adequacy of the planned series of tests and reports on the expected decision risk remaining
   after test completion.
5.14. Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP). The TEMP integrates the requirements,
acquisition, T&E, systems engineering, and LCSP sustainment strategies with all T&E
schedules, funding, and resources into an efficient continuum of integrated testing. The PM,
working through the ITT, is responsible for preparing a TES prior to MS A, a draft TEMP to
support the pre-EMD review, and formal TEMPs to support MS B and C for all assigned ACAT
I, IA, II, and other programs on OSD T&E Oversight IAW DoDI 5000.02, Enclosure 4, Table 3,
and Enclosure 6. PMs may tailor the content of the TEMP within regulatory guidelines to fit
individual program needs and satisfy MDA requirements. For programs on the OSD T&E
Oversight List, a stand-alone TEMP is required. For all other programs, the PM either produces
a stand-alone TEMP or incorporates essential T&E planning information into a tailored,
integrated program document per paragraph 5.15.
   5.14.1. TEMP Organization. The TEMP will be written following the format in the DAG,
   Chapter 9. Any type of testing (as described in Chapter 2) used by the program will be
   integrated into Part III (“Test and Evaluation Strategy”) of the TEMP. For non-OSD
   Oversight programs, the TEMP format may be modified to facilitate program
   accomplishment per paragraph 5.15. The completed TEMP conveys such information as:
       5.14.1.1. The linkage between the requirements, acquisition, T&E, and sustainment
       strategies.
       5.14.1.2. The linkage between operating and enabling concepts, the SEP, operational
       requirements and architectures, system characteristics, threat documents, test design
       information, CTPs, COIs, MOEs, MOSs, and increments of capability.
       5.14.1.3. Organizational responsibilities for the contractor(s), PM, LDTO, PTO(s), and
       operational testers.
       5.14.1.4. Integrated test methodologies and designs.
       5.14.1.5. Test resources.
       5.14.1.6. Test limitations and test deferrals (see paragraphs 5.20 and 6.4.3).
       5.14.1.7. The LFT&E strategy and plans, and the strategy for system certification of
       readiness for dedicated operational testing.
       5.14.1.8. MAJCOM testing, to include operational testing for follow-on increments.
   5.14.2. TEMP Submittal and Coordination. Obtain the required TEMP signatures as
   shown in the TEMP Signature Page Format in the DAG, Chapter 9. All Air Force TEMPs
   will include a signature block for the LDTO next to the OTO.
       5.14.2.1. The ITT forwards a TEMP final draft “in parallel” to all stakeholder
       organizations represented on the ITT for pre-coordination review. ITT representatives
       are expected to verify concurrence or identify outstanding issues within 30 days.
       Dissenting organizations must provide a position statement, to include alternatives, or
       formal non-concurrence on the draft TEMP within this timeframe. Following this pre-
56                                                           AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013


     coordination period, the PM signs the TEMP and staff in parallel to all required
     “concurrence signature” organizations below the Air Staff level. After “concurrence
     signatures” are obtained, the TEMP will be forwarded to the Air Staff, through the PEM,
     for Air Force and OSD coordination and approval.
     5.14.2.2. For all OSD T&E Oversight programs, the PEO will submit the TEMP to
     SAF/AQ Workflow (safaq.workflow@pentagon.af.mil) for PEM staffing. The PEM
     will coordinate through required Air Staff offices (to include AF/TE and the SAE, in that
     order) for formal Service-level approval. After SAE signature, the PEM will submit the
     TEMP to DASD(DT&E) and DOT&E via OSD’s TEMP Workflow (RSS dd - OSD-ATL
     TEMP, or temp@osd.mil).
     5.14.2.3. For all other programs not requiring OSD approval, the PEM will ensure the
     SAE (or designated representative) signs as the final Service approval authority. AF/TE
     will sign prior to the SAE as the “DoD Component Test and Evaluation Director.” If the
     SAE is not a signatory, no signature is required for the “DoD Component Test and
     Evaluation Director.”
  5.14.3. Schedule. TEMPs requiring OSD approval should be submitted to the PEO for
  review and signature 120 days prior to the decision review. After the PEO signs, the TEMP
  goes to the PEM via SAF/AQ Workflow not later than 90 days prior to the decision review
  for HQ USAF (i.e., Service-level) coordination and AF/TE and SAE approval. Not later than
  45 days prior to the decision review, the SAE sends the TEMP to OSD for review and
  approval. If OSD has issues, they may send the TEMP back to the PEM for changes. After
  OSD’s changes are incorporated, the SAE submits the final Service-approved TEMP 10 days
  prior to the decision review for final OSD approval. See Attachment 2 for a summary of
  coordination requirements.
  5.14.4. Multi-Service TEMPs. The lead Service is responsible for coordinating multi-
  Service TEMPs. Signatures from the “concurrence signature” organizations in the other
  participating Services must be obtained before TEMP submission to the PEM, who submits
  in turn to the Service T&E executives, the SAEs (or MDA if appropriate), and OSD. Due to
  the extra signatures required, add 30 days to the PEO and SAE signature times cited in
  paragraph 5.14.3, and 15 days to the times required for OSD approval.
  5.14.5. TEMP Updates and Administrative Changes. The PM and ITT will:
     5.14.5.1. Make updates to the TEMP whenever significant revisions impact the program
     or T&E execution as defined by the PM, DOT&E, DASD(DT&E), or AF/TE. Updates
     are required prior to major milestones IAW DoDI 5000.02, and will be staffed as
     described in paragraphs 5.14.2 through 5.14.4. Note: Updates are any revisions that alter
     the substantive basis of the MDA certification or otherwise cause the program to deviate
     significantly from the material previously presented, or if the conditions that formed the
     basis for the original agreement have changed. (DoDI 5000.02, Enclosure 4, Table 2-1,
     Note 4 contains general guidance from 10 U.S.C. § 2445(c) about what constitutes an
     update.)
     5.14.5.2. Make administrative changes for small corrections or modifications to the
     TEMP. Administrative changes do not impact T&E execution and do not require full
AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                       57


       coordination as described in paragraphs 5.14.2 through 5.14.4 Provide an errata page
       listing these changes.
   5.14.6. When a TEMP Is No Longer Required. Once a program’s acquisition is complete
   and COIs satisfactorily resolved, a TEMP may no longer be required. For programs on OSD
   T&E Oversight, the ITT should initiate requests to cancel the TEMP. Submit such requests
   and justification through AF/TE to OSD. For non-oversight programs, TEMP cancellation is
   at the discretion of the ITT.
5.15. Tailored Integrated Documentation. AFI 63-101/20-101 and AFPAM 63-128
encourage the PM to tailor, combine, and streamline program documentation to meet program
needs as long as specified document content, formats, and templates are followed.
   5.15.1. The Air Force tailoring concept permits consolidation of multiple documents (e.g.,
   the Acquisition Strategy and acquisition plan, TES, TEMP, and SEP) into fewer documents,
   perhaps a single document if justifiable. The MDA retains the authority to tailor and make
   the final determination of what information is covered.
   5.15.2. For ACAT programs not on the OSD T&E Oversight List that do not develop a
   stand-alone TEMP, the PM uses the TEMP outline in the DAG, Chapter 9. Include critical
   T&E planning information from Parts II, III, and IV of the TEMP format. The PM must
   include all ITT members when preparing the T&E portions of this document. MDAs may
   use attachments, annexes, or a web-based site to ensure all information is covered. See AFI
   63-101/20-101 and AFPAM 63-128 for details.
5.16. Management of T&E Data. Accurate and efficient data collection is essential in all T&E
efforts and must be planned before any testing starts. Integrated testing requires use of common
test parameters across test boundaries for uniform data collection, scoring, analysis, and
reporting purposes. Testers must have a clear understanding of their actual data needs because
data collection can be a major expense. The PM must establish a common T&E database for the
program.
   5.16.1. Common T&E Data Management. The PM will establish a common T&E
   database as early as practical for all T&E data for the system under test. The goal is to
   leverage all available T&E knowledge about the system. A statement about data validity and
   a point of contact must be attached to each data batch. All program stakeholders will have
   access to T&E data on a need-to-know basis. Classified, proprietary, competition sensitive,
   and government-only data require restricted access. The ITT will ensure that any RFP or
   SOW supports inclusion of contractor T&E data as part of this database, as well as all T&E
   data from previous increments and real world operations. All testers must allow open data
   sharing and non-interference observation by other testers, the system developer, contractor,
   users, DOT&E, DASD(DT&E), and the PM.
   5.16.2. Tracking T&E Data. All test teams establish rigorous data collection, control,
   accountability, and security procedures for T&E data. To avoid using questionable test data,
   test teams must verify the origin and integrity of any data used in final reports, i.e., whether
   the data came from contractors, DT&E, integrated testing, other Service OTAs, deployed
   assets used in real world operations, or dedicated Air Force operational tests. T&E data from
   deployed early prototypes used and evaluated in real world operations should be properly
   archived. See paragraphs 5.16.9, 5.17, 5.18, and 6.9 for more information.
 58                                                            AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013


   5.16.3. Contractor T&E Data. Test teams and TIPTs should use as much contractor T&E
   data as possible if its accuracy can be verified. Contractor T&E data should be visible in the
   common T&E database.
   5.16.4. Operational Testers. Operational testers may use data from sources such as DT&E,
   integrated testing, and OAs to augment or reduce the scope of dedicated operational testing if
   the data can be verified as accurate and applicable. DOT&E review and approval of data
   sources is standard procedure for programs on Oversight.
   5.16.5. Joint Reliability and Maintainability Evaluation Team (JRMET). The PM will
   establish a JRMET (or similar TIPT) to assist in the collection, analysis, verification, and
   categorization of reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM) data. The JRMET may
   also review applicable DRs and recommend whether or not they should be closed. The PM
   or designated representative chairs the JRMET during DT&E; an operational test
   representative chairs during dedicated operational testing. Note: A Deficiency Review
   Board (DRB) is better for scoring software deficiencies than a JRMET. See paragraph 5.17.4
   and TO 00-35D-54, Chapter 2.
   5.16.6. Periodic Review of Test Data. The PM and testers describe in the TEMP how they
   will jointly review T&E data during the system development and sustainment phases. These
   should be periodic government-only reviews. For programs where AFOTEC is the lead
   operational tester, a Test Data Scoring Board may also be used.
   5.16.7. Timely Release of T&E Data. All test teams will release validated test data and
   factual information according to paragraphs 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5 as soon as practical to other
   testers and stakeholders. Preliminary data may also be released, but must be clearly
   identified as such.
   5.16.8. Disclosing Test Data to Foreign Nationals. The PM is responsible for
   recommending what test data or materials may be disclosed to foreign nationals. Use AFPD
   16-2, Operations Support, Disclosure of Military Information to Foreign Governments and
   International Organizations, and AFI 61-204, Disseminating Scientific and Technical
   Information. See paragraphs 7.9 and 7.10 about the release and protection of test
   information.
   5.16.9. Data Archiving Strategy. The ITT must develop a strategy for archiving key T&E
   information and data that have significant record value for permanent retention. Consider the
   system’s importance and potential for future inquiries into test design, conduct, and how
   results were determined. Retain test plans, TEMPs, analyses, annexes, and related studies, in
   addition to final reports, to maintain a complete historical picture. DTIC is the normal
   repository for archived records.
5.17. Deficiency Reporting (DR) Process. All testers must plan for identifying deficiencies
and enhancements and submitting DRs IAW AFI 63-501, Air Force Acquisition Quality
Program. All Government testers will use the Joint Deficiency Reporting System (JDRS)
described in TO 00-35D-54, Chapter 2, unless a waiver is approved IAW 1.15 of that TO.
Directions for technical data deficiencies are in TO 00-5-1, Air Force Technical Order System.
See additional information in paragraphs 6.8 and 6.9
   5.17.1. Responsible Agent. The PM has overall responsibility for establishing and
   administering a DR process and tailored procedures for reporting, screening, validating,
AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                      59


   evaluating, tracking, prioritizing, and resolving DRs originating from all sources. A waiver
   must be obtained from HQ AFMC/A4UE if the required DR system is not used. If a
   contractor-based DR system is planned, the RFP and SOW must require the contractor’s DR
   system to interface with the government’s DR system.
   5.17.2. When to Start Reporting DRs. The ITT determines the optimum time to begin
   submitting DRs to the government DR system, but not later than critical design review
   (CDR). DRs should be promptly reported once formal reporting begins; however, a Watch
   Item (WIT) tracking system may be used to ensure sufficient data are collected for accurate
   reporting. The contractor-based DR system may suffice for the early stages of development,
   but the government-based DR system must become the primary method of reporting and
   tracking DRs during government-conducted T&E.
   5.17.3. Accurate Categorization of DRs. When submitting or screening DRs, all testers
   must ensure the DR’s severity is accurately represented by assigning the proper category as
   defined in TO 00-35D-54. Government testers must clearly distinguish between DRs for
   deficiencies versus “nice-to-have” enhancements going beyond the scope of the system’s
   operational requirements.
   5.17.4. DR Tracking and Management. DT&E and OT&E test directors periodically
   convene a local DRB to review the prioritization, resolution, and tracking of all open DRs
   and WITs. The DT&E test director chairs the DRB during DT&E phases, and the OT&E test
   director chairs the DRB during OT&E phases. Both test directors, plus representatives from
   the PTOs and using MAJCOMs are members of the PM’s MIPRB which provides final
   resolution of all DRs. The ITT periodically convenes a JRMET to review DRs focused on
   reliability, maintainability, and availability.
   5.17.5. Prioritizing DRs. Prioritized DRs are used in preparation for certification of
   readiness for dedicated operational testing. If the PM cannot correct or resolve all Category I
   and II DRs before dedicated operational testing begins, or defers fixes for these DRs,
   operational testers and users must assess the impacts. The PM and ITT must reach
   agreement prior to certification of readiness for operational testing and develop a plan for
   resolution and subsequent testing.
   5.17.6. Classified DRs. Since JDRS lacks capability to handle classified DRs, an alternative
   DR system may be necessary. The PM will establish and maintain procedures to manage
   classified or sensitive DRs IAW AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management.
   Coordinate with the applicable program office representative before handling. Produce,
   handle, store, transmit and destroy classified documents according to the applicable program
   security classification guide.
5.18. DRs for Information Assurance Vulnerabilities. When addressing IA vulnerabilities for
IT systems, use the impact codes and severity categories in DoDI 8510.01. Severity categories
expressed as category (CAT) I, CAT II, and CAT III indicate the risk level associated with each
security weakness and the urgency of completing corrective action. They are assigned after
considering all possible mitigation measures that have been implemented within system design
and architecture limitations (Residual Risk). Also see DoDI 8500.2 for details about selecting
and implementing security requirements, controls, protection mechanisms, and standards.
 60                                                               AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013


   5.18.1. DoDI 8510.01 assumes vulnerabilities (i.e., deficiencies) will be present and
   addressed on a continuing basis. These items are addressed via the IA Vulnerability
   Management Process (VMP) which is defined and tailored to the system as documented in
   the system C&A. These vulnerabilities are not necessarily reported using the TO 00-35D-54
   reporting system.
   5.18.2. Systems defined as platform information technology (PIT) are not required to follow
   DoDI 8510.01, but must still use DoDI 8500.2 or National Institute of Standards and
   Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53 rev 4, Security and Privacy Controls for
   Federal Information Systems and Organizations, as a basis for IA C&A. As with DIACAP,
   these C&A activities are a form of DR process for IA vulnerabilities as authorized according
   to AFI 33-210.
      5.18.2.1. When a PIT system requires connection to a non-PIT system or network (i.e.,
      system requiring DIACAP) in order to exchange information as part of the mission of the
      special purpose system, the IA requirements for the exchange must be explicitly
      addressed as part of the interconnection. This technical interconnection for network
      access to PIT is defined as a PITI. These interconnections are subject to DIACAP and
      AFCAP, focusing on the interconnection(s), not the PIT itself.
   5.18.3. When assessing IA vulnerabilities as potential DRs, a separate DR is not needed for
   every identified control, shortfall, or finding. Depending on the severity, IA vulnerabilities
   should be logically grouped (e.g., protect, detect, respond, restore, confidentiality, integrity,
   or availability). A standard way of reporting vulnerabilities and when they qualify as a DR
   should be developed and described in the TEMP. One way of doing this is described in
   AFPAM 63-128, Guide to Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle Management, Section
   A6F, Table A6F.1, Software Severity Levels and Weights. Alternatively, use the following
   documents to assess risk for proper DR and vulnerability categorization: Committee on
   National Security Systems Instruction (CNSSI) 1253, Security Categorization and Control
   Selection for National Security Systems; NIST SP 800-30 rev 1, Guide for Conducting Risk
   Assessments; NIST SP 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk; and NIST SP 800-53A
   rev 1, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems and
   Organizations.
   5.18.4. IA vulnerabilities identified during DT&E and OT&E will be reported as observed
   potential vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, availability, integrity, authentication, and non-
   repudiation of a system. Some IA control vulnerabilities that rise to the level of a deficiency
   will equate to materiel solution defects (design and/or documentation) when they
   demonstrate or have potential for definitive mission impact. Ensure these vulnerabilities are
   documented, vetted, and tracked as a DR according to TO 00-35D-54, Chapter 2, as well as
   in the Plan of Actions and Milestones (POA&M).
5.19. Integrated Technical and Safety Reviews. Independent government technical and safety
personnel examine the technical and safety aspects of T&E plans that involve government
resources prior to commencement of test activities. All test organizations must establish
procedures for when and how these reviews are accomplished. These groups function as
necessary throughout the acquisition process until the system is demilitarized.
   5.19.1. Technical Reviews. Technical reviews assess the soundness of system designs and
   test plans to reduce test risk. Technically qualified personnel with test management
AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                          61


   experience, but who are independent of the test program, will perform these reviews. As a
   minimum, technical reviews will assess test requirements, techniques, approaches, and
   objectives. These reviews also ensure that environmental analyses have been completed as
   required by AFI 32-7061, The Environmental Impact Analysis Process, and 32 Code of
   Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 989. Appropriate parts should be referenced in the test plan.
   5.19.2. Safety Reviews. Safety reviews assess whether the T&E project's safety plan has
   identified and mitigated all health and safety risks. Safety review members must be
   technically qualified and independent of the test program. Test organizations will eliminate
   or mitigate identified risks. All test organizations will set up procedures for controlling and
   supervising tests consistent with the risk involved and according to local range safety criteria.
   In addition, the PM will provide a Safety Release to the LDTO or OTO prior to any testing
   involving personnel IAW DoDI 5000.02, Enclosure 6. Also see AFI 91-202, The US Air
   Force Mishap Prevention Program. Mishap accountability must be clearly established IAW
   AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, prior to conducting tests.
   5.19.3. Nonnuclear Munitions Safety Board (NNMSB). The NNMSB reviews and
   approve all newly developed live, uncertified munitions, fuses, and initiating devices prior to
   airborne testing or release IAW AFI 91-205, Nonnuclear Munitions Safety Board.
   5.19.4. Directed Energy Weapons Certification Board (DEWCB). The DEWCB reviews
   and certifies all directed energy weapons prior to operational, test and training use IAW AFI
   91-401, Directed Energy Weapons Safety.
5.20. Test Deferrals, Limitations, and Waivers. A test deferral is the movement of testing
and/or evaluation of a specific CTP, operational requirement, or COI to a follow-on increment or
test activity (e.g., FOT&E). A test limitation is any condition that hampers but does not preclude
adequate test and/or evaluation of a CTP, operational requirement, or COI during a T&E
program. The ITT documents test deferrals and test limitations in the TEMP and test plans. Test
limitations and test deferrals do not require waivers, but must be described in the TEMP and test
plans, to include, in the case of a deferral, a revised timeline for decisions and reports. These test
limitations and deferrals are considered approved when the TEMP or test plan is approved.
Waivers are the deletion of specific mandatory items; waivers for not conducting OT&E will not
be approved when OT&E is mandated by statute or this AFI. See Attachment 1 for definitions
and paragraph 6.4.3 for more details.

          T&E ACTIVITIES IN SUPPORT OF MILESTONE C AND BEYOND

6.1. Post MS B. The most important activities after the MS B decision and during the EMD and
Production and Deployment phases are shown in Figure 6.1. This chapter focuses on test
execution supporting the MS C, FRP, and fielding decisions. Sustained, high quality tester
activity and collaboration with all program stakeholders must continue. The ITT and individual
test teams implement integrated test plans and activities and report T&E results to decision
makers.

Figure 6.1. Integration of Requirements, Acquisition, IA, and T&E Events Supporting MS
C and Beyond.
AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                     63



6.2. Refining the ITC in the TEMP. The ITT should continue refining the ITC within the
TEMP to support the development of test plans that are integrated. Building on the work done in
previous TES and TEMP documents, continue refining the COIs, CTPs, test objectives, MOEs,
MOSs, MOPs, resources, and schedules as necessary. Test teams continue planning for
execution of test plans that are integrated, covering as many DT&E, operational, and IA test
objectives as possible prior to dedicated operational testing. A series of OAs should be
integrated into the test program to reduce program risk. T&E and systems engineering
practitioners use STAT methodologies to optimize the overall number of test events and test
articles without compromising test objectives. Tester activities during the EMD phase and
beyond help identify performance shortfalls and other areas that could cause unintended
increases in development, operations, and life cycle costs. The ITC should describe M&S tools
and DSMs for test design, systems engineering, and data evaluation, and how these supplement,
augment, and extrapolate empirical T&E data wherever practical.
6.3. Developing Test Plans That Are Integrated. The ITC integrates all individual contractor
and government test plans into a linked series of evaluations compatible in objectives, schedule,
and resources. These plans are focused on the current increment, with follow-on increments
described in lesser detail. A single program test plan is not required. The ITT must plan for
OAs intermingled with operationally relevant DT&E to produce increasing amounts of
operationally relevant data within each increment.
   6.3.1. Operational Assessments. One or more OAs should be planned and conducted early
   enough in the EMD phase to provide operational inputs to requirements and system
   development prior to MS C. OAs must be tailored to emphasize an integrated testing
   approach for assessing system capabilities in preparation for dedicated operational testing.
   6.3.2. Integrated Testing. Test plans that are integrated should support each increment with
   DT&E and one or more OAs if appropriate. OAs should be planned to assess and describe
   system maturity, and system capabilities and limitations with respect to the operational
   requirements and enabling and operating concepts for that increment. Timely, credible, and
   continuous feedback must be provided to developers, users, and decision makers. These
   plans should address as many of the COIs, MOEs, and MOSs as possible before dedicated
   operational testing begins.
   6.3.3. Specialized Testing. Any required specialized types of T&E described in Table 2.2
   should be completed by MS C. These tests should be designed to support dedicated
   operational testing that concentrates on mission impacts and unanswered COIs, MOEs,
   MOSs, and MOPs. The dedicated operational test plan may use operationally relevant data
   collected during previous testing to verify system capabilities in the approved CPD for the

6.4. Realistic Testing. This AFI implements DoDI 5000.02 and 10 U.S.C. § 2399 which
require the conduct of realistic operational tests in a realistic operational environment, using
production representative articles, to evaluate a system’s overall effectiveness and suitability,
and to assess impacts to wartime and peacetime operations. See descriptions of operational
testing in paragraph 2.5 and the DAG, Chapter 9.
 64                                                             AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013


   6.4.1. Limitations on Use of M&S. Dedicated OT&E will not be based solely on computer
   modeling, simulation, or an analysis of system requirements, engineering proposals, design
   specifications, or any other information contained in program documents. M&S tools and
   DSMs must receive sufficient VV&A IAW AFI 16-1001, AFI 63-101/20-101, and AFI 14-
   206, Modeling and Simulation.
   6.4.2. Virtual Test Environment. Systems with large IT content and DBS should use a
   "virtual" environment whenever possible that emulates real-world networks and threats.
   6.4.3. Deferment of Operational Testing. Operational testers will not defer testing of any
   KPPs, COIs, or operational requirements to future increments unless planned for in the
   Acquisition Strategy and ITC portion of the TEMP. If an unplanned deferral is unavoidable
   at the MS C or FRP decision, the PM will consult with the using command and requirements
   authorities to decide on the best strategy for completing the deferred testing. The decision is
   documented in an approved ADM and TEMP, and an OT&E waiver is not required. See
   paragraphs 5.14 and 5.20.
   6.4.4. Support of AFOTEC-Conducted Operational Testing. MAJCOM operational
   units, test centers, complexes, and other DT&E organizations may be requested to support
   AFOTEC-conducted operational testing. This support is documented in TEMPs, TRPs, ITT
   charters, test plans, MOAs, and directed in MAJCOM test project orders. AFOTEC prepares
   TRPs in time to budget during the POM cycle.
   6.4.5. Tests Involving Personnel. If personnel are used as test subjects, the level of risk to
   the person must be documented IAW DoDI 3216.02, Protection of Human Subjects and
   Adherence to Ethical Standards in DoD-Supported Research. The PM will provide a Safety
   Release to the LDTO and/or OTO prior to any testing involving personnel. See DoDI
   5000.02, Enclosures 6 and 12, and AFMAN 63-119, Attachment 25, for additional
   information.
6.5. Certification of System Readiness for Dedicated Operational Testing. The PM will
implement the Certification of System Readiness for Dedicated Operational Test review process
described in AFMAN 63-119 as early as practical during the EMD phase. Developmental and
operational testers participate and assist the PM in preparation for OT&E, and carrying out
responsibilities as agreed. The readiness certification is mandatory for reviewing all programs
on the OSD T&E Oversight List, and all programs on the Air Force Acquisition Master List
(AML). Sustainment programs and other acquisition projects falling below the AML threshold
are highly encouraged to follow this process; however, the OT&E certification can be tailored to
suit the scope and criticality of the program. The process and reporting of results may be tailored
to suit program objectives as long as they comply with the requirements of AFMAN 63-119.
See DoDI 5000.02, Enclosure 6, for additional requirements.
   6.5.1. The OT&E Certification Official. For programs on the OSD T&E Oversight List,
   DoDI 5000.02 requires the SAE to determine system readiness for IOT&E. For other
   programs, the MDA is the OT&E Certification official. The SAE or MDA may delegate this
   authority (via Acquisition Decision Memorandum) to the responsible PEO. OT&E
   Certification Officials for smaller programs originating at MAJCOM or Center levels may be
   delegated to a subordinate level as appropriate. Under no circumstance shall a PM be the
   OT&E Certification Official for his/her own program. The OT&E Certification Official
   determines the overall scope and schedule for the operational test readiness review and
AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                      65


  certification process IAW AFMAN 63-119, Chapter 1. The Certification Official and the
  planned implementation of the certification process will be identified in the TEMP.
  6.5.2. The Readiness Certification Process. To be certified ready for dedicated operational
  testing, the system must be mature, production and operationally representative; demonstrate
  stabilized performance in an operationally relevant environment; and all necessary test
  support must be available as planned. The certification process must be a continuous effort,
  not a single event in time. Multiple reviews at logical waypoints in a program are strongly
  encouraged such as prior to each OA and milestone decision point. COIs, MOEs, MOPs, and
  MOSs must be reviewed for relevance and achievability before entering dedicated OT&E.
  The system must have a high likelihood of a successful operational test. Identified shortfalls
  will be remedied before dedicated operational testing starts or work-around solutions will be
  developed, negotiated and documented between the PM, user, and operational testers. An
  automated certification process tracking tool for all templates is available on the AF/TE
  portion of the Air Force Portal. Modify this tool as needed to match any changes made to the
  templates.
  6.5.3. Assessment of Operational Test Readiness (AOTR). DASD(DT&E) conducts an
  AOTR for programs on the OSD DT&E Oversight List. The PM should work with the
  DASD(DT&E) representative on the ITT to synchronize conduct of the final AFMAN 63-
  119 certification review and AOTR to avoid duplication of effort.
  6.5.4. Final Certification of Readiness for Dedicated Operational Testing. Final
  certification review and briefing of system readiness must be completed approximately 45
  calendar days prior to the planned start of dedicated operational testing to allow time for last
  minute program adjustments or deficiency corrections. This time may be shorter if the PM
  and operational testers mutually agree. Certification requires a formal briefing to the OT&E
  Certification Official.      The briefing shall address DT&E results, conclusions,
  recommendations, identified deficiencies and workarounds, and an assessment of the
  system’s capability to meet operational requirements. AFMAN 63-119 will be used as a
  guide to structure the briefing and demonstrate readiness. Both operational testers and
  developmental testers are represented at the briefing. The briefing shall inform the OT&E
  Certification Official of any outstanding disagreements between the OTO, user, and the PM.
  The OT&E Certification Official forwards a certification of readiness memo to the OTO
  commander at least 15 days prior to the start of dedicated operational testing, or as agreed.
  6.5.5. OT&E Readiness Agreement. The PM, user, and operational testers must
  coordinate regularly throughout the system’s development to address OT&E readiness
  shortfalls. PMs, jointly with their OT&E counterparts, shall provide the OT&E Certification
  Official detailed mitigation strategies for open shortfalls found during DT&E, and will
  identify outstanding disagreements on OT&E readiness between the OTO, user, and the
  program office prior to the formal certification briefing. The OT&E Certification Official is
  responsible for weighing all factors before certifying readiness, and it is the PM’s
  responsibility to ensure the OT&E Certification Official is made fully aware of all areas of
  OTO, user, and program office concern. In all cases, identified shortfalls must be either
  remedied before dedicated operational testing starts, or mitigated via agreement or
  workarounds negotiated between the PM, user, and operational testers. If necessary, the
  OT&E Certification Official and OTO equivalent counterpart shall negotiate and plan the
  OT&E way forward before formalizing the certification of readiness memo. If agreement
 66                                                             AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013


   cannot be reached at this point, outstanding issues may be elevated to SAF/AQ and AF/TE
   for final resolution.
   6.5.6. Considerations for Early Deployment of Prototypes.           Use the applicable
   certification templates in AFMAN 63-119 to review the system’s capabilities and limitations
   prior to early operational deployment of prototypes, UONs, JEONs, QRCs, and JCTDs.
   6.5.7. Certification for Systems with Multiple Increments or Releases. If a system is
   fielded in multiple releases or increments (common with IT and software intensive systems),
   then the PM ensures the OT&E Certification Official provides a certification of readiness to
   the OTO commander prior to the decision to go to each independent operational test event.
   The certification should be tailored to and pertain specifically to the planned release of
   capability. For example, IT systems using rapid release methodologies may substantially
   compress their certification schedule and reduce the number of certifications and templates
   reviewed. Releases may require substantially less time and effort than an increment.
6.6. Plans and Briefings for Operational Testing. DOT&E requires operational testers (i.e.,
the OTA) to submit written plans and present briefings as discussed below for programs on OSD
OT&E Oversight. The information requirements below apply in full to AFOTEC and
MAJCOMs unless DOT&E relief is documented. See Attachment 2 for a summary.
   6.6.1. Operational Test Concept Briefings. DOT&E requires a test concept briefing a
   minimum of 180 days before the start of dedicated operational tests for programs on OSD
   OT&E Oversight IAW DoDI 5000.02. AF/TEP will arrange for corporate Air Force-level
   reviews of test concept briefings. User and developer representatives are required to attend
   these briefings. For multi-Service programs, the other Services will also be invited. A pre-
   brief to the Air Staff is required before going to DOT&E and should be coordinated through
   AF/TEP. DOT&E may elect to defer this requirement and accept a later briefing of the final
   operational test plan in lieu of the test concept briefing. Operational test concept briefings
   for OAs should be presented a minimum of 180 days before test start for programs on OSD
   T&E Oversight. No briefings are required to OSD for non-Oversight programs.
   6.6.2. Operational Test Plans and Test Plan Briefings. An operational test plan is due to
   DOT&E a minimum of 60 days prior to test start. DOT&E may request, or the OTO may
   elect, to present a briefing to accompany the final test plan. This briefing will be coordinated
   the same way as an operational test concept briefing.
6.7. OSD Involvement. Programs on DT&E, LFT&E, and/or OT&E Oversight remain under
continuous OSD surveillance through fielding and into sustainment until removal from the OSD
T&E Oversight List. The ITT must be prepared for additional briefings to OSD and test plan
approvals as described in paragraph 4.7. Additional briefings requested by DOT&E should be
routed through AF/TEP before submission to OSD. The information required for OSD T&E
Oversight programs is summarized in Attachment 2.
6.8. Operational Tester DR Responsibilities. Prior to the FRP decision review, operational
testers and users complete a final prioritization of all open DRs for resolution and funding. The
MAJCOM’s priorities must be used for rank-ordering these DRs. The final priorities are
forwarded to the PM to help direct corrective actions and will be listed in the final report.
6.9. Tracking and Closing DRs. Not all open DRs may receive funding or be corrected after a
system is accepted for operational use. The database of open DRs may provide the only
AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                     67


documentation of unsatisfactory conditions or worthwhile system enhancements. At no time will
the program office unilaterally close or downgrade DRs without formal consultation with the
originating test organization and MAJCOM project officer. MAJCOM project officers must
continue to track open DRs until they are corrected, or the MAJCOM concurs with closing them.
6.10. Integrated Testing During Sustainment and Follow-on Increments. Follow-on
increments and modifications continue in parallel with and subsequent to acquisition of the first
increment. OT&E is required for each increment of capability prior to release to the user. This
testing is structured according to the program’s Acquisition Strategy, TEMP, and updated
requirements documents.
   6.10.1. The existing ITT should continue functioning to ensure continuity of acquisition and
   T&E operations. All areas of the ITT charter should be carefully reviewed and modified as
   necessary.
   6.10.2. The T&E activities described in Chapters 4, 5, and 6 must be tailored for risk, new
   or revised JCIDS requirements, and other factors, and repeated as needed during the
   Operations and Support phase. Testers should capitalize on previously completed work
   products, TTP, analyses, results, and lessons learned, thus eliminating redundant testing and
   work. Sustainment acquisitions, to include support equipment and Form, Fit, Function, and
   Interface (F3I) replacements, require FRP or fielding decisions and an appropriate type of
   operational testing.
6.11. Disposing of Test Assets. Test assets (e.g., instrumentation and test articles) from
canceled or completed tests are catalogued and returned to government T&E organizations or
acquisition or sustainment programs, or refurbished and reassigned to owning MAJCOMs.
Surplus or unusable items are sent to the applicable Defense Reutilization Management Office.
6.12. OT Reporting on Fielding of Prototypes or Pre-Production Systems. Warfighter
operational needs may require rapid and/or early fielding of new capabilities. This may result in
early operational use of prototypes, technology demonstration systems, test articles, or pre-
production systems prior to the completion of required dedicated operational testing and formal
production decisions. In these situations, the OTO (as determined in paragraph 4.6) may opt to
produce a C&L Report to inform the warfighter and fielding decision authorities. The C&L
Report provides the most current operational test perspective on developmental system
capabilities and limitations based on testing done to date. See paragraph 7.5 for more
information about C&L Reports.
 68                                                           AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013


                                          Chapter 7

                         TEST AND EVALUATION REPORTING

7.1. General Reporting Policy. Test reports must be timely, factual, concise, and tailored to
the needs of decision makers. They should be delivered in time to support the designated
milestone or decision review. All T&E plans describe which kinds of reports are required, their
contents, and when and to whom they are submitted. All test reports contain evaluations of test
results and conclusions. Additional findings, considerations, and recommendations are not
required but may be included if deemed appropriate. All reports must be properly archived and
retrievable for future use. Reporting requirements for programs on OSD T&E Oversight are
summarized in Attachment 2. All days are “calendar days” unless otherwise stated.
7.2. DT&E Reports. The types and frequency of DT&E reports are tailored to meet decision
makers’ requirements as documented in the TEMP and test plan. DT&E data and analytic
support (i.e., “reports”) must be provided to the program decision review process to certify the
system ready for dedicated IOT&E. LFT&E reports must be submitted to DOT&E 45 days prior
to the beyond-LRIP decision review. The PM documents requirements for contractor test reports
in the CDRL. Formal briefings are generally not required.
7.3. DT&E Report Distribution. The ITT will develop a distribution list for all DT&E reports
which includes operational testers, PTOs, applicable MAJCOMs, AF/TE, and DTIC. DT&E
reports are not releasable to non-government agencies without prior approval and coordination of
the PM. Release of contractor test reports may be subject to restrictions in the contract. For
OSD T&E Oversight programs, the PEM will send a copy through appropriate channels to
DASD(DT&E) and DOT&E if required.
7.4. Operational Test Reports.
   7.4.1. Significant Test Event Reports. These reports briefly describe the results of
   significant test events during operational test activities. Operational testers submit these
   reports to the appropriate agencies (e.g., PM, CDT, LDTO, PTOs, operational MAJCOM,
   PEM, PEO, AF/TE, and/or DOT&E, depending upon level of interest in the program) within
   24 hours of any significant test event as described in the test plan.
   7.4.2. Final Reports. Final reports should normally be delivered not later than 30 days prior
   to the supported decision in order to provide adequate time for review. Delivery timelines
   may be tailored to accommodate accelerated test schedules for specific user needs if
   coordinated with the decision review authority. Reports must address each of the COIs, the
   system’s operational effectiveness and suitability. These reports must strike the proper
   balance between system capabilities and limitations while taking into account how well the
   system performed mission essential tasks. When appropriate, a production or fielding
   recommendation may be included for IOT&E, QOT&E, FOT&E, OUE, SOTR, and FDE
   final reports. All Category I DRs and the most important Category II DRs will be listed.
   Detailed technical information should be published in separate data documents. Final report
   briefings are provided to HQ USAF staff and OSD as requested.
   7.4.3. Interim Reports. Decision makers may require written information about T&E
   results during execution of an ongoing test plan. Use these types of interim reports
   depending on the need.
AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                       69


       7.4.3.1. Status Reports. A status report provides updates and important test findings
       during operational testing. Status report format and content are flexible. Status reports
       are normally very short (no more than several pages) and should not be written as a mini
       final report. It may be periodic (monthly, quarterly, or as required), associated with
       specific (planned test) events, or in response to an external organization or agency request
       for test status. Status reports may be used to inform fielding decisions associated with
       each release when an OT&E, OUE, or OA report is not required or applicable. The
       operational test plan should document the requirements for a status report to include the
       frequency and distribution for periodic status reports.
       7.4.3.2. Interim Summary Reports. If the final report cannot be ready in time to
       support a key decision, the decision authority may instead accept a written interim report
       or a formal briefing. For oversight programs, AF/TE will help establish a new report due
       date. If a briefing is used, a separate written interim summary report is not required. Any
       additional data collected is added to the final report when available.
   7.4.4. MOT&E Final Reports. The lead OTO prepares a single MOT&E final report
   aggregating all OT&E information from the participating Services’ inputs.              Each
   participating Service has the option of preparing its own supplemental report as an
   attachment to the single MOT&E report. All significant differences between Service test
   results should be explained. This guidance also applies to testing with other DoD or Federal
   agencies. See the Memorandum of Agreement on Multi-Service Operational Test and
   Evaluation (MOT&E). Final MOT&E reports are required 45 days prior to the decision
   review. Briefings will be provided to HQ USAF staff and OSD as requested.
   7.4.5. Reporting SOTR Results. Each MAJCOM may develop its own SOTR report
   format as needed. All conclusions and related recommendations based on the SOTR will be
   formally documented. All data and data sources used to conduct the SOTR should be
   identified. See paragraphs 2.5.11 and 4.6.6.3.
7.5. Capabilities and Limitations (C&L) Reports. While not mandatory, the C&L report is
appropriate when a system or prototype is provided to units for training in preparation for
fielding, or when the system is deployed directly to an operational unit. A C&L report may also
be appropriate to support MAJCOM UON or JEON requests, combat capability documents
(CCD), or WRAP proposals. To ensure maximum flexibility, C&L reports have no prescribed
format. The level of detail provided varies depending on the amount of pre-existing information
available, the warfighter’s need for technical information, and the amount of time and resources
available to conduct additional testing before the fielding decision. The C&L report should not
make specific recommendations concerning the system fielding decision or release for training
purposes. This report may be provided to DOT&E to support their requirement in 10 U.S.C. §
2399 for an early report to Congress.
   7.5.1. C&L reports are based on existing, verifiable T&E data (contractor, developmental,
   and operational) derived from all available system development, ground, and flight test
   activities. The goal is to help warfighters gain early knowledge of potential operational
   effectiveness and suitability of systems that have not yet completed dedicated operational
   testing. Release of a C&L report does not obviate the requirement for dedicated OT&E. Six
   months after publication of the C&L report, the OTO should review program status to
 70                                                            AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013


   determine whether an updated C&L report is necessary. C&L reports will not drive new
   testing requirements for a system.
   7.5.2. All relevant data sources used to develop the C&L report should be identified.
   Include a program description and a summary of the current phase of formal system testing.
   The report should identify observed system capabilities and limitations and describe any
   areas of untested or unknown capabilities. Suitability observations, interoperability
   considerations, and IA issues should also be included. The type and scope of planned, but
   not yet accomplished, testing should also be described. If time is available for a dedicated
   operational test event such as an OUE, then that alternative would obviate the need for a
   C&L report. If an operational test event is in progress or recently completed, a status report
   or interim summary report may be more appropriate.
7.6. Operational Test Report Distribution. Operational testers send reports to the program
stakeholders and DTIC as determined by the ITT. For OSD OT&E Oversight programs, AF/TE
will forward copies to DOT&E and DASD(DT&E). A summary of operational test reporting
requirements is in Attachment 2.
7.7. Electronic Warfare (EW) Programs. All EW programs on OSD T&E Oversight are
required to annually report their progress in implementing the DoD T&E Process for EW
Systems IAW P.L. 103-160 § 220(a). PMs and test organizations for these programs provide
T&E information to AF/TEP according to Attachment 2. AF/TEP will consolidate information
in coordination with AF/A5RE before submitting to DASD(DT&E).
7.8. Briefing Trail. AF/TE will arrange for Air Force-level review(s) of test report briefings.
For multi-Service programs, the other participating Services will be invited to the briefing. The
PM must be prepared to address technical questions, program issues, DT&E, and the resolution
of deficiencies. Users must be available to answer questions regarding operational requirements
and mission impacts of fielding the system.
7.9. Distributing and Safeguarding Test Information.
   7.9.1. Within the DoD. Test organization commanders determine release authority for data,
   reports, and information under their control. Classified test information cannot be released
   except as specified in DoDI 5200.01, DoD Information Security Program and Protection of
   Sensitive Compartmented Information, and associated documents.
       7.9.2. Outside the DoD. Test directors do not have release authority for test information
       and communications outside DoD channels. Freedom of Information Act requests should
       be processed IAW DoD5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302, Freedom Of Information Act
       Program. Test information released to Congress, the General Accountability Office, the
       DoD Inspector General, or similar agencies must follow guidance in AFI 90-401, Air
       Force Relations With Congress, and AFI 65-401, Relations With The Government
       Accounting [sic] Office (GAO). SAF/IAPD, the Disclosure and Technology Transfer
       Division, is the designated Air Force disclosure authority for release of classified and
       controlled unclassified weapons systems, technologies and information to foreign
       governments and international organizations in support of Air Force, DoD and
       commercial international programs.
7.10. Information Collection and Records.
AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                     71


  7.10.1. No information collections are created by this publication.
  7.10.2. Program records created as a result of the processes prescribed in this publication are
  maintained according to paragraph 5.16.9 and AFMAN 33-363, and disposed of IAW the Air
  Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in the Air Force Records Information
  Management System (AFRIMS).

Terms
Note:—A common understanding of terms is essential to effectively implement this instruction.
In some cases, definitions from multiple sources are offered where they may be of value.
“Notes” and italicized words in brackets at the end of definitions are not an official part of that
definition, and are added for clarity for information only.
Note: For additional terms and definitions not listed below, see Joint Publication (JP) 1—
02, Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, and Air Force Doctrine
Document (AFDD) 1-2, Air Force Glossary, which contain standardized terms and definitions
for DoD and Air Force use. Also see Test and Evaluation Management Guide, 5th edition,
Defense Acquisition University (DAU) Press.
Note: See AFI 10—601 and AFI 63-101/20-101 for definitions of terms relating to the
requirements and acquisition processes.
Acquisition Category (ACAT)—Acquisition categories determine the level of review, decision
authority, and applicable T&E policies and procedures. They facilitate decentralized decision
making and execution, and compliance with statutorily imposed requirements. (See DoDI
5000.02, Enclosure 2 for details.)
Agile Release—(1) The act of issuing a software version for publication, use, or distribution as a
result of agile software development. (2) A new release of a software program.
Agile Software Development (ASD)—(1) A group of software development methodologies
based on iterative and incremental development where requirements and solutions evolve
through highly collaborative, self-organizing, cross-functional teams.      (2) An iterative
development approach that focuses on mature technologies, continuous testing, test-driven
development, continuous user involvement and requirements definition, and rapid early fielding
of working functionality.
Availability (Ao)—A measure of the degree to which an item is in the operable and committable
state at the start of a mission when the mission is called for at an unknown (random) time.
(DAG)
BIG SAFARI—The 645th Aeronautical Systems Group (also known as the BIG SAFARI
Program) executes sensitive United States Government and foreign military sales programs in
support of high priority, rapid-requirement, and urgent operational needs by direction of the
AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                        85


Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition (SAF/AQ). BIG SAFARI is responsible for
total life cycle ownership over those assigned programs and projects, and functions as PM with
LDTO and OTO responsibilities to support Operational Safety, Suitability, and Effectiveness
objectives in coordination with the ultimate end user.
Capabilities and Limitations (C&L) Report—An optional, quick-look report of limited scope
that operational testers provide to operational units to support rapid and/or early fielding of
developing capabilities before dedicated operational testing is complete and formal production
begins. It provides the most current operational test perspectives on system capabilities and
limitations based on testing done to date, and describes any untested or unknown areas.
Capability—Based Testing—A mission-focused strategy for T&E for verifying that a
capabilities solution will enable operations at an acceptable level of risk. Capabilities-oriented
evaluations are the primary T&E methodology throughout system testing, but traditional
evaluations of system performance measured against specification-like requirements are also
used. Capabilities-based testing requires understanding operational concepts and involves
developing strategies for T&E and plans to determine whether a capability solution option merits
fielding.
Chief Developmental Tester (CDT)—A designated government T&E professional in an MDAP
or MAIS program office selected to coordinate, plan, and manage all DT&E activities, to include
contractor testing, and who makes technically informed, objective judgments about DT&E
results. For non-MDAP and non-MAIS programs, this person is known as the Test Manager.
(10 U.S.C. § 139b)
Combined Test Force (CTF)—An integrated team of military, civilian, and contractor T&E
professionals empowered to plan and execute tests and report results in a collaborative, effective,
and efficient manner over the entire life cycle of a system.
Combined Testing—See Integrated Testing.
Common T&E Database—A repository of all available T&E data for a single acquisition
program or system under test that is accessible to all program stakeholders with a need to know.
Covered System—DoD term that is intended to include all categories of systems or programs
requiring Live Fire Test and Evaluation. A covered system means a system that the Director,
Operational Test and Evaluation, acting for the Secretary of Defense, has designated for LFT&E
oversight. These include, but are not limited to, the following categories:
a. Any major system within the meaning of that term in Title 10 U.S.C. § 2302(5) that is
user—occupied and designed to provide some degree of protection to its occupants in combat; or
   b. A conventional munitions program or missile program; or a conventional munitions
   program for which more than one million rounds are planned to be acquired (regardless of
   whether or not it is a major system); or
   c. A modification to a covered system that is likely to affect significantly the survivability or
   lethality of such a system.
Covered Product Improvement Program—See Covered System.
Critical Operational Issue (COI)—1. Operational effectiveness and operational suitability
issues (not parameters, objectives, or thresholds) that must be examined during operational
 86                                                            AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013


testing to determine the system’s capability to perform its mission. (paraphrased from DAU’s
Test and Evaluation Management Guide) 2. A key question to be answered by operational
testers when evaluating a system’s overall operational effectiveness, suitability, and operational
capabilities.
Critical Technical Parameter (CTP)—Measurable critical system characteristics that, when
achieved, allow the attainment of operational performance requirements. They are technical
measures derived from user requirements. Failure to achieve a critical technical parameter
should be considered a reliable indicator that the system is behind in the planned development
schedule or will likely not achieve an operational requirement. (paraphrased from DAG)
Dedicated Operational Testing—Operational test and evaluation that is conducted
independently from contractors, developers, and operational commands and used to support
production or fielding decisions.
Deficiency Report (DR)—The generic term used within the USAF to record, submit, and
transmit deficiency data which may include, but is not limited to, a Deficiency Report involving
quality, materiel, software, warranty, or informational deficiency data submitted using Standard
Form (SF) 368 or equivalent format. (TO 00-35D-54)
Category I Deficiency—Those which may cause death, severe injury, or severe occupational
illness; may cause loss or major damage to a weapon system; critically restricts the combat
readiness capabilities of the using organization; or which would result in a production line
stoppage.
Category II Deficiency—Those that impede or constrain successful mission accomplishment
(system does not meet minimum operational requirements but does not meet the safety or
mission impact criteria of a Category I deficiency). It may also be a condition that complements,
but is not absolutely required for, successful mission accomplishment. The recommended
enhancement, if incorporated, will improve a system’s operational effectiveness or suitability.
Deployment—1. The movement of forces within operational areas. 2. The relocation of forces
and materiel to desired operational areas. Deployment encompasses all activities from origin or
home station through destination. (JP 1-02)
Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E)—Test and evaluation conducted to evaluate
design approaches, validate analytical models, quantify contract technical performance and
manufacturing quality, measure progress in system engineering design and development,
minimize design risks, predict integrated system operational performance (effectiveness and
suitability) in the intended environment, and identify system problems (or deficiencies) to allow
for early and timely resolution. DT&E includes contractor testing and is conducted over the life
of the system to support acquisition and sustainment efforts. (DAG)
Early Operational Assessment (EOA)—An operational assessment (OA) conducted before MS
B. An EOA assesses the design approach sufficiently early in the acquisition process to assure it
has the potential to fulfill user requirements. (See Operational Assessment.)
Elevated Level of Assurance (ELA)—A measure of confidence that the security features,
practices, procedures, and architecture of an information system accurately mediates and
enforces the security policy. On the Common Criteria predefined assurance scale, higher
AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                       87


(elevated) levels indicate the most rigorous, formal criteria for security evaluation. (CNSS
National IA Glossary)
Enabling Concept—Describes how a particular task or procedure is performed, within the
context of a broader functional area, using a particular capability, such as a specific technology,
training or education program, organization, facility, etc. An enabling concept describes the
accomplishment of a particular task that makes possible the performance of a broader military
function or sub-function. (See AFI 10-2801 for further information on Air Force concepts.)
Enhancement—A condition that improves or complements successful mission accomplishment
but is not absolutely required. The recommendation, if incorporated, will enhance a system’s
operational safety, suitability and/or effectiveness. An enhancement report should not be
designated as such solely due to an “out-of-scope” condition as described in contractual
requirements.
Evaluation Criteria—Standards by which the accomplishment of required technical and
operational effectiveness and/or suitability characteristics, or resolution of operational issues,
may be addressed. (DAG)
Evaluation Framework Matrix—A table required in the TEMP that shows the correlation
between the COIs, key requirements (KPPs and KSAs), key test measures (CTPs, MOEs and
MOS), planned test methods, and test resources, facilities, or infrastructure needs.
Evolutionary Acquisition—Evolutionary acquisition is the preferred DoD strategy for rapid
acquisition of mature technology for the user. An evolutionary approach delivers capability in
increments, recognizing, up front, the need for future capability improvements. The objective is
to balance needs and available capability with resources, and to put capability into the hands of
the user quickly. The success of the strategy depends on the phased definition of capability
needs and system requirements, and the maturation of technologies that lead to disciplined
development and production of systems that provide increasing capability towards a materiel
concept. The approaches to achieve evolutionary acquisition require close collaboration between
the user, tester, and developer. (paraphrased from DoDI 5000.02)
Fielding—The decision to acquire and/or release a system to users in the field.

plans that are integrated. Note: The ITT is the Air Force equivalent to the T&E Working
Integrated Product Team (T&E WIPT) described in the DAG.
Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD)—JCTDs fill the gap between science
and technology and acquisition for the combatant commands (COCOMs). JCTDs focus on
resolving the joint, combined, coalition, and interagency warfighting and operational problems of
the COCOMs within a 1- to 3-year timeline. JCTDs resolve problems primarily by conducting
technology and operational demonstrations and operational utility assessments of mature
technology/solutions (Technology Readiness Level 5-7) and transitioning them to the acquisition
community for post-JCTD development, production, fielding, and operation and maintenance.
(DAG)
Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&E)—An OSD-sponsored T&E program conducted among more

be the same as the threshold when an operationally significant increment above the threshold is
not significant or useful. (AFI 10-601)
Operating Concept—A description in broad terms of the application of military art and science
within a defined set of parameters. In simplest terms, operating concepts articulate how a
commander will plan, prepare, deploy, employ or sustain a joint force against potential
adversaries within a specified set of conditions. Operating concepts encompass the full scope of
military actions required to achieve a specific set of objectives. (See AFI 10-2801 for further
information on Air Force concepts.)
Operational Assessment (OA)—An analysis of progress toward operational capabilities made
by an OTO, with user support as required, on other than production systems. The focus of an
operational assessment is on significant trends noted in development efforts, programmatic
voids, areas of risk, adequacy of requirements, and the ability of the program to support adequate
operational testing. Operational assessments may be made at any time using technology
demonstrators, prototypes, mockups, engineering development models, or simulations, but will
not substitute for the dedicated OT&E necessary to support full production decisions.
Operational Command—Air Combat Command, Air Mobility Command, AF Special
Operations Command, Air Education and Training Command, Air Force Global Strike
Command, and Air Force Space Command. Those commands that will ultimately operate, or are
operating, a system, subsystem, or item of equipment. (AFI 10-601 / AFI 63-101/20-101)

Operational Test Agency (OTA)—An independent agency reporting directly to the Service
Chief that plans and conducts operational tests, reports results, and provides evaluations of
overall operational capability of systems as determined by effectiveness, suitability, and other
operational considerations. Note: DoDD 5000.01 states, “Each Military Department shall
establish an independent OTA . . .” Therefore, each Service has one designated OTA which are
as follows. The Air Force has the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC).
The Navy has the Operational Test and Evaluation Force (OPTEVFOR). The Army has the
Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC). The Marine Corps has the Marine Corps
Operational Test and Evaluation Agency (MCOTEA).
Operational Test Organization (OTO)—A generic term for any organization that conducts
operational testing as stated in its mission directive.
Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E)—1. The field test, under realistic combat
conditions, of any item of (or key component of) weapons, equipment, or munitions for the
purpose of determining the effectiveness and suitability of the weapons, equipment, or munitions
for use in combat by typical military users; and the evaluation of the results of such test. (10
U.S.C. § 139(a)(2)) 2. Testing and evaluation conducted in as realistic an operational
environment as possible to estimate the prospective system's operational effectiveness,
suitability, and operational capabilities.     In addition, OT&E provides information on
organization, personnel requirements, doctrine, and tactics. It may also provide data to support
or verify material in operating instructions, publications, and handbooks. Note: The generic
term OT&E is often substituted for IOT&E, QOT&E, FOT&E, OUE, FDE, WSEP, and TD&E
and depending on the context, can have the same meaning as those terms.
Operational Testing—A generic term encompassing the entire spectrum of operationally
oriented test activities, including assessments, tests, and evaluations. Not a preferred term due to
its lack of specificity.
Operational Utility Evaluation (OUE)—Evaluations of military capabilities conducted to
demonstrate or validate new operational concepts or capabilities, upgrade components, or expand
the mission or capabilities of existing or modified systems. AFOTEC or MAJCOMs may
conduct OUEs whenever a dedicated operational test and evaluation event is required, but the
full scope and rigor of a formal IOT&E, QOT&E, FOT&E, or FDE is not appropriate or
required. OUEs may be used to support operational decisions (e.g., fielding a system with less
than full capability) or acquisition-related decisions (e.g., low-rate production) when appropriate
throughout the system lifecycle. OUEs will not be used when IOT&E, QOT&E, FOT&E or
FDE are more appropriate per existing guidance and definitions.
Operator—See “User.” Refers to the operating command which is the primary command
operating a system, subsystem, or item of equipment. Generally applies to those operational
commands or organizations designated by Headquarters, US Air Force to conduct or participate
in operations or operational testing, interchangeable with the term "using command" or “user.”
In other forums the term “warfighter” or “customer” is often used. (AFI 10-601) “User” is the
preferred term in this AFI.
AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                        93

program directors, product group managers, single managers, acquisition program managers, and
weapon system managers. Operating as the single manager, the PM has total life cycle system
management authority. Note: This AFI uses the term “PM” for any designated person in charge
of acquisition activities, to include those prior to MS A (i.e., before a technology project is
officially designated an acquisition program).
Prototype—A model suitable for evaluation of design, performance, and production potential.
(JP 1-02) Note: The Air Force uses prototypes during development of a technology project or
acquisition program for verification or demonstration of technical feasibility. Prototypes are not
usually representative of the final production item.
Qualification Operational Test and Evaluation (QOT&E)—A tailored type of IOT&E
performed on systems for which there is little to no RDT&E-funded development effort.
Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), non-developmental items (NDI), and government furnished

Risk—1. A measure of the inability to achieve program objectives within defined cost and
schedule constraints. Risk is associated with all aspects of the program, e.g., threat, technology,
design processes, or Work Breakdown Structure elements. It has two components: the
probability of failing to achieve a particular outcome, and the consequences of failing to achieve
that outcome. (Glossary, Defense Acquisition Acronyms and Terms) 2. Probability and severity
of loss linked to hazards. (JP 1-02)
Severity Category—The category a certifying authority assigns to an IT system security
weakness or shortcoming as part of a certification analysis to indicate the risk level associated
with the security weakness and the urgency with which the corrective action must be completed.
Severity categories are expressed as “Category (CAT) I, CAT II, or CAT III,” with CAT I
indicating the greatest risk and urgency. Severity categories are assigned after consideration of
all possible mitigation measures that have been taken within system design/architecture
limitations for the DoD information system in question. (DoDI 8510.01)
CAT I Severity Category—Assigned to findings that allow primary security protections to be
bypassed, allowing immediate access by unauthorized personnel or unauthorized assumption of
super-user privileges. An Authorization to Operate (ATO) will not be granted while CAT I
weaknesses are present.
CAT II Severity Category—Assigned to findings that have a potential to lead to unauthorized
system access or activity. CAT II findings that have been satisfactorily mitigated will not prevent
an ATO from being granted.
CAT III Severity Category—Assigned findings that may impact IA posture but are not
required to be mitigated or corrected in order for an ATO to be granted.
Simulator Certification (SIMCERT)—The process of ensuring through validation of hardware
and software baselines that a training system and its components provide accurate and credible
training. The process also makes sure the device continues to perform to the delivered
specifications, performance criteria, and configuration levels. It will also set up an audit trail
regarding specification and baseline data for compliance and subsequent contract solicitation or
device modification. (AFI 36-2251)
Simulator Validation (SIMVAL)—The process for (1) comparing a training device’s operating
parameters and performance to the current intelligence assessment of a weapon system, threat,
and interaction between the weapon system and threat, and (2) documenting the differences and
impacts. This process includes generation and deployment of an intelligence data baseline of the
system, comparison of simulator characteristics and performance, support for the modification
and upgrade of the simulator, a comparison of simulator and threat operating procedures, and
correction of any significant deficiencies. Uncorrected deficiencies are identified and published
in validation reports. The process continues throughout the life cycle of the simulator. (AFI 36-
2251)
Specification—A document intended primarily for use in procurement which clearly and
accurately describes the essential technical requirements for items, materials, or services,
including the procedures by which it will be determined that the requirements have been met.

Spiral—One subset or iteration of a development program within an increment. Multiple spirals
may overlap or occur sequentially within an increment. Note: An obsolete term, but may be in
older documents. Generally, spirals are not fielded IAW DoDI 5000.02, CJCSI 3170.01, and
AFI 63-101/20-101.
Strategy for T&E—A high-level conceptual outline of all T&E required to support
development and sustainment of an acquisition program.
Sufficiency of Operational Test Review (SOTR)—An examination by MAJCOM operational
testers of all available test data to: 1) determine if adequate testing has been accomplished for
programs of limited scope and complexity; and 2) to assess the risk of fielding or production
without a dedicated OT&E. An examination of existing test data, not an operational test per se.
Survivability—The capability of a system and crew to avoid or withstand a man-made hostile
environment without suffering an abortive impairment of its ability to accomplish its designated
mission. Survivability consists of susceptibility, vulnerability, and recoverability. (DAG)
Susceptibility—The degree to which a weapon system is open to effective attack due to one or
more inherent weaknesses. (Susceptibility is a function of operational tactics, countermeasures,
probability of enemy fielding a threat, etc.) Susceptibility is considered a subset of survivability.
(DAG)
Sustainment—1. The provision of personnel, logistic, and other support required to maintain
and prolong operations or combat until successful accomplishment or revision of the mission or
of the national objective. (JP 1-02) 2. The Service's ability to maintain operations once forces
are engaged. (AFDD 1-2) 3. Activities that sustain systems during the operations and support
phases of the system life cycle. Such activities include any investigative test and evaluation that
extends the useful military life of systems, or expands the current performance envelope or
capabilities of fielded systems. Sustainment activities also include T&E for modifications and
upgrade programs, and may disclose system or product deficiencies and enhancements that make
further acquisitions necessary.
Tactics Development and Evaluation (TD&E)—TD&E is a tailored type of FDE specifically
designed to further exploit doctrine, system capabilities, tactics, techniques, and procedures
during the sustainment portion of the system life cycle. TD&Es normally identify non-materiel
solutions to tactical problems or evaluate better ways to use new or existing systems.
Testable—The attribute of being measurable and repeatable with available test instrumentation
and resources. Note: Testability is a broader concept indicating whether T&E infrastructure
capabilities are available and capable of measuring the parameter. The difference between
testable and measurable may indicate a test limitation. Some requirements may be measurable
but not testable due to T&E infrastructure shortfalls, insufficient funding, safety, or statutory or
regulatory prohibitions.
Test and Evaluation (T&E)—The act of generating empirical data during the research,
development or sustainment of systems, and the creation of information through analysis that is
useful to technical personnel and decision makers for reducing design and acquisition risks. The
process by which systems are measured against requirements and specifications, and the results
analyzed so as to gauge progress and provide feedback.
AFI99-103 16 OCTOBER 2013                                                                         97


Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP)—Documents the overall structure and objectives of
the T&E program. It provides a framework within which to generate detailed T&E plans and it
documents schedule and resource implications associated with the T&E program. The TEMP
identifies the necessary developmental, operational, and live-fire test activities. It relates
program schedule, test management strategy and structure, and required resources to: COIs;
critical technical parameters; objectives and thresholds documented in the requirements
document; and milestone decision points. (DAU’s Test and Evaluation Management Guide)
Test and Evaluation Organization—Any organization whose designated mission includes test
and evaluation.
Test and Evaluation Strategy (TES)—Describes the concept for tests and evaluations
throughout the program life cycle, starting with Technology Development and continuing
through Production and Depolyment. The TES evolves into the Test and Evaluation Master Plan
at MS B. The TES provides a road map for evaluations, integrated test plans, and resource
requirements needed to accomplish the Technology Development phase. (paraphrased from the
DAG, Chap 9)
Test Deferral—The movement or delay of testing and/or evaluation of a specific critical
technical parameter, operational requirement, or critical operational issue to a follow-on
increment or later test period. A test deferral does not change the requirement to test a system
capability or function.
Test Director—–A person responsible for coordinating, leading, and executing a test and
reporting the results according to a specific test plan.
Test Integrated Product Team (TIPT)—Any temporary group consisting of testers and other
experts who are focused on a specific test issue or problem. There may be multiple TIPTs for
each acquisition program.
Test Limitation—Any condition that hampers but does not preclude adequate test and/or
evaluation of a critical technical parameter, operational requirement, or critical operational issue
during a T&E program.
Test Manager—–A designated government T&E professional in a non-MDAP/non-MAIS
program office selected to coordinate, plan, and manage all DT&E activities, to include
contractor testing, and who makes technically informed, objective judgments about DT&E
results. For MDAP or MAIS programs, this responsibility is fulfilled by the Chief
Developmental Tester (CDT).
Test Resources—A collective term that encompasses all elements necessary to plan, conduct,
and collect/analyze data from a test event or program. Elements include test funding and support
manpower (including temporary duty costs), test assets (or units under test, test asset support
equipment, technical data, simulation models, test beds, threat simulators, surrogates and
replicas, special instrumentation peculiar to a given test asset or test event, targets, tracking and
data acquisition, instrumentation, equipment for data reduction, communications, meteorology,
utilities, photography, calibration, security, recovery, maintenance and repair, frequency
management and control, and base/facility support services. (DAU’s T&E Management Guide)
Test Resource Plan (TRP)—The single document AFOTEC uses to request personnel and other
resource support for operational test and evaluation from MAJCOMs and other agencies.

Test Team—A group of testers and other experts who carry out integrated testing according to a
specific test plan. Note: A combined test force (CTF) is one way to organize a test team for
integrated testing.
Threshold—A minimum acceptable operational value below which the utility of the system
becomes questionable.
User—Refers to the operating command which is the primary command operating a system,
subsystem, or item of equipment. Generally applies to those operational commands or
organizations designated by Headquarters, US Air Force to conduct or participate in operations
or operational testing, interchangeable with the term "using command" or “operator.” In other
forums the term “warfighter” or “customer” is often used. (AFI 10-601) Also refers to
maintainers. “User” is the preferred term in this AFI.
Validation—The process of evaluating a system or software component during, or at the end of,
the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified requirements. (DAG)
Verification—Confirms that a system element meets design-to or build-to specifications.
Throughout the system’s life cycle, design solutions at all levels of the physical architecture are
verified through a cost-effective combination of analysis, examination, demonstration, and
testing, all of which can be aided by modeling and simulation. (DAG)
Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&A)—VV&A is a continuous process in the
life cycle of a model or simulation as it gets upgraded or is used for different applications. (AFI
16-1001)
Verification—Process of determining that M&S accurately represents the developer’s
conceptual description and specifications.
Validation—Rigorous and structured process of determining the extent to which M&S
accurately represents the intended “real world” phenomena from the perspective of the intended
M&S use.
Accreditation—The official determination that a model or simulation is acceptable for use for a
specific purpose.
Vulnerability—The characteristic of a system that causes it to suffer a definite degradation (loss
or reduction of capability to perform its designated mission) as a result of having been subjected
to a certain (defined) level of effects in an unnatural (man-made) hostile environment.
Vulnerability is considered a subset of survivability. (DAG)
Waiver—A decision not to conduct OT&E required by statute or policy.
Weapon System Evaluation Program (WSEP)—A test program conducted by MAJCOMs to
provide an end-to-end tailored evaluation of fielded weapon systems and their support systems
using realistic combat scenarios. WSEP also conducts investigative firings to revalidate
capabilities or better understand munitions malfunctions.
