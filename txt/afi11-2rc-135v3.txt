SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change implements new guidelines that clarify requirements for primary aircrew
members during flight. Clarifies requirements for minimum crew manning during in-flight
operations. Changes the term Mission Essential Ground Personnel (MEGP) to Mission Essential
Personal (MEP). Amends orientation flight guidance. Removes the term TCTO 509; identifies
squadron commander approval for use of reverse thrust data on OC/WC aircraft and provides
clarification on aircraft taxi obstruction clearance to minimum taxiway width requirements. It
eliminates redundancy in cold weather procedures, adds requirements for navigator systems
cross checks, to note in-flight clearances and to record information to permit accurate
reconstruction of the aircraft position through the mission, and provides guidance for RC-135 S
aircraft concerning arresting cables during recovery. A margin bar (|) indicates newly revised
material.

                                             Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General.
     1.1.1. This AFI provides guidelines for RC/OC/WC/TC-135 operations and applies to
     RC/OC/WC/ TC-135 aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of the
     RC/OC/WC/TC-135. The annotation “C-135” applies to RC/OC/WC/TC-135. It is both a
     compilation of information from aircraft flight manuals, flight information publications
     (FLIP), and Air Force directives, as well as an original source document for many areas.
     Basic source directives have precedence in the case of any conflicts, revisions, and matters of
     interpretation.
     1.1.2. HQ ACC/A3 is the agency responsible for the administration for this instruction
     IAWAFPD 11-2.
     1.1.3. Copies will be current and available to planning staffs from headquarters to aircrew
     level. Transportation and base operations passenger manifesting agencies will also maintain
     a copy of this AFI.
1.2. Deviations and Waivers. Do not deviate from the policies and guidance in this AFI under
normal circumstances, except:
     1.2.1. For safety.
     1.2.2. When beyond C2 communications capability and it is necessary to protect the crew or
     aircraft from a situation not covered by this AFI, the aircraft commander has ultimate
     authority and responsibility for the course of action to be taken. Report all deviations or
     exceptions without waiver through channels to MAJCOM OPR and OCR.
     1.2.3. When a controlling source publication changes, that publication takes precedence until
     the change is incorporated herein. After a change is made to a controlling source, a change to
     this AFI will be distributed in a timely manner.
     1.2.4. Waiver authority is the MAJCOM/A3, or equivalent, exercising Administrative
     Control (ADCON) unless delegated lower in this AFI. Waiver requests for training missions
     under ACC ADCON will be submitted through channels to HQ ACC/A3C. Waivers
     required for exercises and operational missions involving aircraft from more than one unit or
     command should be coordinated with other participants to ensure standardization. In all
     cases, waiver approval and coordination should be published in the operations order
     (OPORD) or operations plan (OPLAN).
1.3. Revisions. Users of this AFI are encouraged to submit proposed changes through
appropriate channels to HQ ACC/A3CR according to AFI 11-215, Flight Manuals Program
(FMP). Use AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.
1.4. Key Words and Definitions. See Attachment 1 of this volume for additional terms.

                             COMMAND AND CONTROL (C2)

2.1. Commander Authority. Combatant Command (COCOM), Operational Control
(OPCON), Tactical Control (TACON) and Administrative Control (ADCON) of all C-135 forces
are IAW applicable DEPORDs and Joint Publication 1, Doctrine for the Armed Forces of the
United States.
2.2. Operations Plan 8010 (OPLAN 8010). Commander, U.S. Strategic Command
(USSTRATCOM) exercises OPCON of reconnaissance forces generated in support of OPLAN
8010.     Commander, TF-204 (Bomber/Reconnaissance) is delegated TACON of the
reconnaissance forces generated in support of OPLAN 8010.
2.3. Aircraft Commander Responsibility and Authority. An aircraft commander is
designated for all flights on the flight authorizations. Aircraft commanders are:
   2.3.1. In command of all persons aboard the aircraft.
   2.3.2. Responsible for the welfare of the crew and the safe accomplishment of the mission.
   2.3.3. Vested with the authority necessary to manage crew resources to accomplish the
   mission and will make decisions not specifically assigned to higher authority.
   2.3.4. Final authority for requesting or accepting any waivers affecting the crew or mission.
   2.3.5. The aircraft commander is responsible for interaction between the aircrew and the C2
   agency or the applicable support detachment. Any factor that may affect mission
   accomplishment, or when transiting a stop without a support agency, the aircraft commander
   will ensure necessary mission information is placed into the C2 system by the most
   expeditious means available. The aircraft commander will establish a point of contact with
   the appropriate C2 agency or support detachment prior to entering crew rest.
   2.3.6. If the aircraft commander refuses a mission for safety reasons, the aircraft will not
   depart until the conditions have been corrected, improved or waived IAW para 1.2.4 or
   Chapter 6 A2.1.1.
2.4. C2 Reporting. Aircraft commander will ensure pertinent data, as listed in Chapter 6 of this
AFI, is relayed to the appropriate C2 agency by any means available. For a Busy Relay, updated
information will normally be provided 2-3 hours from destination.
   2.4.1. All HF transmissions should be restricted to operational traffic, i.e. movement
   reporting, itinerary revisions, maintenance status, flight plan information, etc.
   2.4.2. Enroute Reporting: SATCOM (when available) and HF monitoring and reporting will
   be conducted per applicable operations orders, operations plans, concept of operations, or
   mission directives.

                       CREW COMPLEMENT AND MANAGEMENT

3.1. Aircrew Qualification. Primary crewmembers, or those occupying a primary position
during flight, must be qualified or in training for qualification for that crew position. The
crewmember must be under the supervision of an instructor or flight examiner if non-current or
in training. EXCEPTIONS: Senior staff members (pilots only) who have completed the Senior
Staff Course (A004) may occupy either pilot seat under direct IP supervision. IAW AFI 11-220,
Reconnaissance Flight Rules and Procedures, operational sorties must have a qualified mission
crewmember on the aircraft for each required crew position. If conducting student training on
operational missions, qualified crewmembers must be able to take the student’s place and assume
their duties in the event of an emergency or operational necessity.
     3.1.1. Crewmembers undergoing difference qualification between C-135 variants can credit
     events for continuation training provided their qualification is current. If the crewmember
     will not maintain dual-qualification, difference training cannot be credited toward
     continuation training.
     3.1.2. The most qualified crewmembers will occupy crew positions during emergency
     situations. The Pilot in Command as designated by the Flight Orders will dictate who
     occupies the crew positions during emergency situations.
3.2. Minimum Crew Manning. The minimum crew required for flight for C-135s is two pilots
(at least one of which is an AC, IP, or EP) and a navigator. An instructor pilot with an
unqualified pilot enrolled in a formal course of training can satisfy the two-pilot requirement.
Augmentation requirements are defined in AFI 11-202V3, ACC Sup1.
     3.2.1. Mission Systems Operation In-flight. The minimum crew required to employ the
     mission system for each C-135 MDS is as follows:

                               OPERATING RESTRICTIONS

4.1. Objectives. Final responsibility regarding equipment, systems or flight maneuvers required
for a mission rests with the aircraft commander. All units operating C-135 aircraft will comply
with the appropriate approved Minimum Equipment List (MEL) found in Chapter 6 of this AFI.
4.2. Policy. This chapter lists the equipment, systems and flight maneuvers considered essential
for C-135 missions. The restrictions apply at all times unless specified.
   4.2.1. The 55 OG/CC, or appropriate EOG/CC or O-6 with EOG/CC authority, is the waiver
   authority for these restrictions unless specifically delegated to Squadron/Detachment
   Commanders:
       4.2.1.1. AFI 11-2RC-135 Vol. 3, Maximum Crosswind. Authorize takeoff of aircraft
       within maximum flight manual limitations.
       4.2.1.2. Taxi approval for intended route with an RCR less than 8 reported for the
       parking ramp, taxiways and runway.
   4.2.2. The 55 OG/CC delegates the following waiver authority to Squadron/Detachment
   Commanders.
       4.2.2.1. AFI 11-2RC-135 Vol. 3, Maximum Crosswind. Authorize recovery of aircraft
       within maximum flight manual limitations.

Notes:

1. Instructor Pilots-day or night. 1000/2 miles or circling minimums for the approach being
flown, whichever is higher, with an RCR of 9 or greater. Aircraft commanders-day only. 3000/3
miles with an RCR of 23. Aircraft Commanders may not supervise 3-engine maneuvers.

2. Use a runway of sufficient width and length to permit a safe, normal, full-stop landing.

3. Maximum crosswind component is 15 kts for IP supervised, 10 kts for aircraft commander.

4. Aircraft commander minimums are 1000/3, or published minimums whichever is higher.

5. IP minimums are 200/ ½ mile visibility, 2400 RVR, or published minimums, whichever is
higher.

6. Do not accomplish Touch-and-Go landings on slush, ice or snow covered runways, or with an
RCR less than 9.

7. Do not retard the throttle on a simulated engine failure after takeoff prior to 200 feet AGL.

8. Aircraft commanders can accomplish (not supervise) Touch and Go landings with any
qualified copilot. For a copilot to accomplish Touch and Go landings without an IP, both aircraft
commander and copilot must be squadron commander certified.

9. Per T.O. 1C-135(RC)(I)-1 guidance, Touch-and-Go’s will NOT be performed in the RC-135U
at any time.

4.5. Touch-and-Go and Receiver Air Refueling Supervision.
   4.5.1. Aircraft Commander (Non-IP) Supervision of Copilot Maneuvers.
       4.5.1.1. Non-instructor aircraft commanders (AC) may supervise unit copilot’s touch-
       and-go landings and receiver air refueling under the following conditions:
AFI11-2RC-135V3 22 APRIL 2010                                                                    13


           4.5.1.1.1. The AC has been certified by the squadron commander to supervise each
           of these events.
           4.5.1.1.2. The copilot has been certified by the squadron commander to perform
           these events under AC supervision.
           4.5.1.1.3. Squadron commander certification is documented in unit Letter of
           Certifications (Letter of X’s).
   4.5.2. Copilot Maneuvers While Supervised by a Non-IP Aircraft Commander.
       4.5.2.1. An Instructor/Evaluator Pilot must document on a TAPR that the copilot is able
       to accomplish either/both event(s) to a safe level.
       4.5.2.2. The squadron commander must certify the copilot per paragraph 4.5.1.1.3.
4.6. Touch-and-Go Landing Limitations. Touch-and-go landings are prohibited on slush, ice,
or snow covered runways. When conditions are "patchy," touch-and-go landings are at the
discretion of the 55 OG/CC, or appropriate EOG/CC or O-6 with EOG/CC authority.
4.7. Operating Limitations. Do not practice emergency procedures that degrade aircraft
performance or flight control capabilities unless specifically authorized elsewhere in this section.
   4.7.1. The AC/IP will alert applicable crewmembers prior to practicing emergency
   procedures.
   4.7.2. In an actual emergency, terminate all training and emergency procedures practice.
   Training should be resumed only when the pilot in command determines it is safe.
   4.7.3. The powered rudder (and the EFAS for RC/TC-135 aircraft) will be on for all takeoffs
   and landings except for an actual system failure.
   4.7.4. Do not simulate failure of two engines in flight while conducting simulated engine out
   procedures. Do not actually shut an engine down for training.
   4.7.5. Maximum crosswind for takeoff and landing during peacetime is 25 knots. RCR may
   limit this capability.
   4.7.6. Practice Emergency or Abnormal Gear and Flap Operation must be accomplished
   clear of clouds (not applicable when IP is occupying a pilot seat). May be accomplished day
   or night.
4.8. Performance Requirements.
   4.8.1. Departure Performance Planning. Use AFI 11-202v3, AFMAN 11-217v1, this
   chapter, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplements. During mission planning, the flight
   crew will determine a gross weight that ensures RC/OC/WC/TC-135 performance will meet
   or exceed departure requirements. Reference AFMAN 11-217v1 for runway end crossing
   height requirements. Note: In the event performance capability cannot meet the published
   climb gradient at the desired gross weight either download fuel, use other applicable methods
   described below, or delay until more favorable conditions exist.
   4.8.2. All Engines Operating (AEO). The RC/OC/WC/TC-135 will meet or exceed the
   published climb gradient or 200 ft/nm, whichever is higher. Note: If the aircraft cannot meet
 14                                                       AFI11-2RC-135V3 22 APRIL 2010


   the “ATC climb rate” (denoted with a dagger † ) pilots must notify ATC that they cannot
   meet the published gradient.
   4.8.3. One Engine Inoperative (OEI). The RC/OC/WC/TC-135 will meet or exceed the
   published climb gradient or 200 ft/nm, whichever is higher. If this requirement cannot be
   met other methods that may be used on a case by case basis are described below:
      4.8.3.1. Vertically Clear all Obstacles. If aircraft are unable to meet the published climb
      gradient or 200 ft/nm, whichever is higher, crews may subtract 48 ft/nm from the gradient
      with operations supervisor approval. Crews are reminded this procedure allows for as
      little as zero feet of obstacle clearance.
      4.8.3.2. Special Departure Procedure (SDP). [NA OC/WC] SDPs are authorized and
      available for RC/TC-135 aircraft. SDPs are MDS specific, OEI, airfield specific escape
      procedures intended for emergency use after loss of an engine during takeoff. These may
      be used for departure planning with Operations Supervisor (or deployed equivalent)
      approval for missions that are operationally necessary. 55 OG/CC defines operationally
      necessary as any HHQ sortie or any sortie that originates from KOFF or KLNK. Crews
      are reminded that SDPs may allow as little as zero feet of obstacle clearance.
          4.8.3.2.1. Current RC-135 SDPs can be retrieved from the Jeppesen website at
          https://jeppesen.com/index.jsp. The SDP analysis date is located in the upper left-
          hand corner of the SDP takeoff performance sheet. PICs must ensure the most
          current SDP is used. ‘Ad Hoc’ requests for fields not currently on the watch list may
          be requested through 55 OG/OGV NLT 72 hours prior to scheduled departure. These
          ‘Ad Hoc’ requests are valid as long as they remain on the Jeppesen website.
          4.8.3.2.2. Alternatively to the legacy SDP products described in 4.8.3.2.1. aircrew
          may utilize the Dynamic Runway Analysis (DRA) tool at https://milplanner.com.
          This tool allows planning with specific environmental inputs to narrow planning
          factors.
      4.8.3.3. VFR or VMC Departure. Reference AFI 11-202v3 and appropriate MAJCOM
      supplement for applicable guidance.
   4.8.4. Low Close in Obstacles. Minimum climb gradients do not take into account low,
   close in obstacles (obstacles or terrain 200’ AGL and below within 1NM from DER) which
   should normally be published as a NOTE on the SID or IFR departure procedure (Trouble T).
   The PIC will ensure all applicable low close in obstacles along the departure flight path will
   be safely cleared.
   4.8.5. Do not practice traffic pattern operations, instrument approaches, low approaches or
   go-arounds at gross weights that will not afford a minimum climb gradient of 3.3%. For TF-
   33 equipped aircraft compute with 3 engines, flaps 30, gear up (gear down for emergency
   procedures practice). For F-108 equipped aircraft compute the climb gradient using threshold
   speed minus 10 knots, 3 engines, flaps 30, gear up (gear down for simulated emergency
   procedures practice), go-around N1 setting, and selected asymmetric N1 setting (between
   flight idle and max asymmetric N1). Include the effect of the air conditioning systems.
4.9. Traffic Pattern Limitations. The following limitations apply to both Touch-and-Go and
full stop landings:
AFI11-2RC-135V3 22 APRIL 2010                                                                  15


   4.9.1. Flap Setting. Do not practice landings with less than 30 degree flaps. 30 degree flap,
   full stop landings are prohibited except in emergencies that dictate 30 degree flaps as the
   optimum or only landing configuration. Full stop landings should normally be made with 50
   degree flap settings. Careful consideration should be given to runway length, landing
   distance (including flare and stopping distance), crosswinds, RCR, and other factors
   influencing the landing ground roll in deciding to land with less than 50 degrees of flaps. For
   OC/WC/RC/TC-135 aircraft, it is permissible to use up to 95% delayed braking factor when
   determining 30 flap total landing distance on planned touch and go landings.
   4.9.2. Gross Weight. Landing gross weights will not exceed 210,000 pounds for TF-33
   equipped aircraft or 220,000 pounds for RC/TC-135 aircraft for normal operation. If mission
   requirements dictate, and a safe stopping distance exists, the MAJCOM/A3 may authorize
   landings up to flight manual weight limits.
   4.9.3. Multiple Full Stop Landings. Compute brake energy prior to each subsequent takeoff.
   4.9.4. Go-Arounds. Initiate a planned go-around not later than 200-foot HAT (does not
   apply to a landing attitude demonstration).
   4.9.5. Limit angle of bank to 30 degrees during traffic pattern operations.
4.10. Prohibited In-flight Maneuvers. In addition to flight manual prohibited maneuvers, the
following maneuvers will not be practiced or demonstrated in flight:
   4.10.1. Stalls.
   4.10.2. Spins.
   4.10.3. Dutch roll.
   4.10.4. Emergency descent.
   4.10.5. Unusual attitudes.
   4.10.6. Compound emergencies (except simulated engine-out with rudder power off).
   4.10.7. Tactics maneuvers (unless MAJCOM-approved).
   4.10.8. Initial buffet.
   4.10.9. Turns greater than 45 degree bank (except MAJCOM-approved tactics maneuvers).
4.11. Low Altitude Operations (LAO) (OC/WC/RC-135). The following low altitude
procedures are provided in support of Open Skies, Constant Phoenix, and Combat Sent in-flight
operational and training missions planned or flown at altitudes below 6000 feet AGL, in addition
to T.O. guidance.
   4.11.1. Altitude.
       4.11.1.1. Overland flights below 3000 ft AGL or over water flights below 1000 ft AGL
       require 55 OG/CC, or appropriate EOG/CC or O-6 with EOG/CC authority, approval and
       should be obtained prior to departure for the deployment or mission.
       4.11.1.2. RC-135 altitudes are restricted IAW AFTTP 3-1 (class).
16                                                        AFI11-2RC-135V3 22 APRIL 2010


     4.11.1.3. When the OG/CC has not approved overland flights below 3000’ the selected
     altitude will provide a minimum clearance of 3000 feet from the highest obstruction or
     terrain within 4 NM of planned course centerline.
  4.11.2. All overland LAO flights will be conducted in Day VMC conditions unless the flight
  is operating on an IFR clearance in controlled airspace.
  4.11.3. Weather. Crews will obtain a turbulence forecast for the planned LAO route and, if
  possible, avoid areas of known/suspected turbulence greater than light.
     4.11.3.1. Do not conduct LAO flights in areas of forecast severe turbulence or reported
     moderate or severe turbulence. If continuous moderate or greater turbulence is
     encountered, deviate or abort the route as soon as possible.
     4.11.3.2. Immediately terminate LAO operations if surface winds exceed 40 knots or
     when moderate or greater turbulence is experienced. This will avoid the possibility of the
     aircraft reaching its structural limits caused by wind gust factors.
     4.11.3.3. Do not conduct LAO flights in areas of forecast severe icing conditions or in
     areas of reported moderate or severe icing conditions.
  4.11.4. Equipment. The following equipment will be operational during LAO operations:
     4.11.4.1. Window heat.
     4.11.4.2. Yaw damper system.
     4.11.4.3. Cockpit accelerometer.
     4.11.4.4. INS able to provide safe corridor navigation (no INS degrades exist).
     4.11.4.5. All axis of the autopilot must be operational for training flights and operational
     LAO beyond the first 12 hrs of the Flight Duty Period.
     4.11.4.6. Radar. (When convective activity is forecasted or when flying over land)
  4.11.5. There are no duration limits for flights entirely over water. From the beginning of
  LAO up to 5 hours (6 if augmented), may be over land. Any LAO after that must be over
  water or above 6000 feet AGL.
  4.11.6. Reserve fuel tanks will remain full during LAO unless aircraft gross weight is less
  than 165,000 lbs.
  4.11.7. Aircraft speed during LAO will not exceed 250 KIAS or best endurance airspeed +10
  Knots, whichever is greater.
  4.11.8. Bird Strike Mitigation. Bird strike potential at low altitude is increased. Consult
  FLIP, migratory bird publications and local bird activity indicators prior to flight.
     4.11.8.1. Consideration should be given to operating the window heat on high setting
     during LAO to make the windows more pliable in case of bird strike.
     4.11.8.2. Report observed hazardous low altitude bird activity to planners during mission
     debriefing.
AFI11-2RC-135V3 22 APRIL 2010                                                             17


     4.11.8.3. For flights in areas where local altimeter settings are not available, use the
     forecast minimum altimeter setting. At level off altitude, match baro altimeter to
     radar/CARA altimeter and cross-check every 15 min.
 18                                                          AFI11-2RC-135V3 22 APRIL 2010

                                        OPERATIONAL

5.1. Checklists.
   5.1.1. Momentary hesitations for coordination items, ATC interruptions, and deviations
   specified in the flight manual, etc., are authorized. Notes amplifying checklist procedures
   and limitations may be added to the checklists IAW AFI 11-215.
   5.1.2. Only insert current approved checklist and information guides in checklist binders. 55
   OG/OGV is the approval authority for locally produced guides.
   5.1.3. Unit-developed checklists are authorized for mission crewmembers. These checklists
   will incorporate equipment configuration/operation, crew duties and coordination items as
   required. They will be used in conjunction with applicable aircraft specific Emergency
   Procedures Checklists contained in the Technical Orders provided by aircraft manufacturers.
   55 OG/OGV will be the final approval authority for all unit-developed checklists IAW AFI
   11-215, Flight Manuals Program.
5.2. Duty Station. A qualified pilot will be in control of the aircraft at all times during flight.
EXCEPTION: Senior staff members who have completed the Senior Staff Course or
unqualified pilots undergoing qualification training (under the supervision of an FTC-approved
instructor). All crewmembers will be at their duty station or in an approved seat during all
takeoffs, departures, air refueling (AR), approaches and landings. During other phases of flight,
crewmembers may leave their duty station for brief periods of time. The IP seat should be
occupied to assist the crew in avoiding other aircraft during takeoff, departure, low level,
penetration, approaches and landings when additional aircrew personnel are aboard.
Crewmembers will notify the crew area commander (e.g. AC, TC, or AMS as applicable) prior
to departing assigned primary duty stations.
5.3. Flight Deck Entry. Aircraft commanders may authorize passengers and observers access
to the flight deck during takeoff, climb, air refueling, descent and landing only if seats with seat
belts are available. Passengers will not be permitted access to the pilot or copilot position.
During takeoff and landing, observers will be seated in a seat approved for use in takeoff and
landing with appropriate safety belts and shoulder harnesses fastened.
5.4. Takeoff and Landing Policy. The pilot flying must be current and qualified for the
maneuver being flown or under direct IP supervision if regaining currency or undergoing
upgrade qualification training.
5.5. Seat Belts.
   5.5.1. Crewmembers occupying the pilot, copilot, navigator, or additional crewmember
   positions will have seat belts fastened at all times in accordance with T.O. procedures unless
   crew duties dictate otherwise.
   5.5.2. All crewmembers will be seated with seat belts and shoulder harnesses fastened
   during takeoff and landing. For taxi and AR operations, all aircrew members should
   (passengers will) be seated with seatbelts fastened, unless crew duties dictate otherwise.
   Crewmembers performing instructor or flight examiner duties are exempt from seat belt
AFI11-2RC-135V3 22 APRIL 2010                                                                   19


   requirements during non-critical phases of flight; however, a seat with an operable seat belt
   will be assigned and should be used unless it would interfere with performance of duties.
5.6. Communications Policy.
   5.6.1. Aircraft Interphone.
      5.6.1.1. Limit transmissions to those essential for crew coordination during all critical
      phases of flight.
      5.6.1.2. Do not discuss classified information on interphone if uncleared personnel are
      on interphone.
   5.6.2. Command Radios.
      5.6.2.1. The pilot not flying the aircraft normally makes all ARTCC radio calls.
      5.6.2.2. In terminal areas the pilot, copilot, and navigator, will monitor the primary
      command (ATC) radio unless directed otherwise. The navigator or designated
      crewmember should monitor C2 frequencies on the inbound and outbound leg, during
      takeoff, climb-out, air refueling, descent, approach, landing and traffic pattern operations,
      unless otherwise directed.
      5.6.2.3. Both pilots will monitor UHF Guard (VHF Guard when appropriate) frequency
      regardless of primary radio. The navigator should monitor Guard during receiver AR and
      at discretion during other times. Pilots normally will not monitor GUARD during
      receiver aerial refueling.
   5.6.3. UNILINK.
      5.6.3.1. For local trainers and busy relays, the crew will enable the AUTO POSITION
      REPORTING function during preflight to ensure messages sent from the ground reach
      the aircraft in a timely manner. AUTO POSITION will be turned off during operational
      sorties or any sortie where the aircraft position is sensitive.
      5.6.3.2. The aircraft commander may authorize usage of the Universal Data Desk for
      valid operational needs. Crews should consider other means of communication before
      utilizing this function. Crews will not transmit sensitive or classified information via
      UNILINK clear text. Crews may transmit USKAK-72 encrypted text as a last resort, but
      should understand that the aircraft identification and position will be revealed. Crews
      will use the ELT/VDL switch included with the FORCE modification to disconnect
      UNILINK from the antenna (which disables it’s transmit and receive capability)
      whenever the aircraft position would be classified. If the aircraft has not had the FORCE
      modification the crews will pull the UNILINK PROCESSOR circuit breaker (MCBP/V9)
      whenever the aircraft position would be classified. Crews should then reconnect via the
      ELT/VDL switch or reset the circuit breaker when aircraft position is no longer sensitive.
      5.6.3.3. Aircraft commanders will ensure the UNILINK Email function is only used for
      official purposes.
      5.6.3.4. Crews may use the weather retrieval functions of UNILINK without restriction
      in non-sensitive environments. Consider OPSEC issues before submitting a weather
      request for a particular station.
 20                                                        AFI11-2RC-135V3 22 APRIL 2010


5.7. Runway, Taxiway, and Airfield Requirements. Minimum runway requirements for C-
135 aircraft are 8,000’ length and 147’ width. Minimum taxiway width for RC/TC/WC-135 is
74’. OC-135 minimum taxiway width is 50’.
   5.7.1. Landing distance will be computed based on actual aircraft configuration and runway
   conditions and will include flare distance and ground roll. C-135 aircraft will normally use
   80% delayed braking factor. Aircraft commanders may elect to use up to 90% delayed
   braking factor as an exception on a case by case basis if operationally necessary for full stop
   landings. 55 OG/CC, or appropriate EOG/CC or O-6 with EOG/CC authority, approval is
   required for full-stop landings planned with greater than 90% delayed braking factor. 55
   OG/CC, or appropriate EOG/CC or O-6 with EOG/CC authority can delegate this waiver
   authority to the SQ/CC, DETCO on a case-by-case basis or for the duration of a deployment
      5.7.1.1. Squadron commander approval is required to use reverse thrust data when
      calculating TOLD.
   5.7.2. Takeoffs will normally be initiated from the beginning of the approved usable portion
   of the runway. Takeoff and landing data (TOLD) will be based on the actual runway
   remaining from the point at which the takeoff is initiated when less than the entire runway is
   used. The decision to make intersection takeoffs rests solely with the aircraft commander.
      5.7.2.1. Squadron commander approval is required to use reverse thrust data when
      calculating TOLD.
   5.7.3. Operational missions using runways with grooved or porous surfaces are authorized to
   use an RCR 15 to compute critical field length, critical engine failure speed and refusal speed
   when the runway RCR is reported as wet. Other takeoff speeds will be computed using
   current flight manual procedures and comply with any limitations imposed by supplementing
   command regulations. Present flight manual procedures for computing takeoff data with a
   reported RCR, other than "wet runway," or RSC (ice, snow, and slush) are valid and remain
   unchanged. This special procedure does not apply to landing data computations.
5.8. Aircraft Taxi Obstruction Clearance and Takeoff Criteria.
   5.8.1. The aircraft commander should use marshallers and wing walkers or deplaned
   crewmembers to act as observers while maneuvering on taxiways with less width than
   specified in para 5.7 of this instruction.
   5.8.2. Intersection takeoffs may be accomplished provided the operating environment (i.e.
   gross weight, obstructions, climb criteria, weather, etc.) will allow a safe takeoff and
   departure using reduced thrust procedures.
   5.8.3. Takeoff will not be made with RCR less than 4.
5.9. Fuel Reserves and Alternate Airport Requirements.
   5.9.1. Fuel Requirements. Plan all missions to arrive overhead destination or worst case
   alternate fix with no less than 15,000 pounds fuel reserve, or in accordance with AFI 11-
   202V3, whichever is greater.
   5.9.2. Minimum landing fuel is 12,000 pounds. If it becomes apparent the aircraft will land
   with 12,000 pounds of fuel remaining or less, declare "Minimum Fuel" and land short of
   destination; or divert as required.
AFI11-2RC-135V3 22 APRIL 2010                                                                  21


   5.9.3. Emergency landing fuel is 10,000 pounds.
   5.9.4. Additional divert base information can be found in Chapter 6 and the Inflight Guide.
5.10. Fuel Jettisoning. No prior approval is required for fuel jettisoning during an aircraft
emergency when immediate reduction of gross weight is a critical factor in safely recovering
aircraft/personnel. If possible, record altitude, position and winds aloft. When the situation
permits, notify the controlling agency of actions and location of fuel jettisoning.
   5.10.1. Record all pertinent data to include flight conditions, altitude, airspeed, air
   temperature, wind direction and velocity, type and amount of fuel, aircraft type and position
   at time of jettison, time and duration of jettison activity, and reason jettison was
   accomplished. Note: Unit commanders will retain the information in paragraph 5.10.1 for 6
   months as documentation in the event of claim against the government resulting from fuel
   jettison.
   5.10.2. Aircraft commanders will obtain SQ/CC or DETCO approval for fuel jettison when
   immediate reduction of gross weight is not required.
5.11. Autopilot Failure. With any axis of the autopilot inoperative, the crew duty period is
restricted to 12 hours un-augmented or 16 hours augmented. The 55 OG/CC, or appropriate
EOG/CC or O-6 with EOG/CC authority, is the waiver authority.
5.12. Adverse Weather. Do not fly in reported severe icing conditions. If inadvertently
encountered, the pilot will immediately depart such conditions. Icing severely degrades the
flight capability of the aircraft. However, should operational missions dictate, short climbs or
descents through areas of forecast severe and/or reported moderate icing are permitted solely at
the aircraft commander’s discretion; however, sustained flight in these conditions is prohibited.
The following will mitigate exposure to thunderstorm hazards when operating in the vicinity of
an aerodrome in an area where thunderstorms are occurring or are forecast. Aircrews will:
   5.12.1. Try to maintain VMC.
   5.12.2. Maintain at least a 5 NM separation from heavy rain showers.
   5.12.3. Not takeoff or land under conditions of freezing rain or freezing drizzle or when
   thunderstorms are producing hazardous conditions (such as hail, strong winds, gust fronts,
   heavy rain, wind shear, or microbursts).
   5.12.4. Avoid areas of high lightning potential, i.e. clouds within plus or minus 5000 feet of
   the freezing level.
5.13. Cold Weather.
   5.13.1. During cold weather conditions, the SQ/CC or DETCO will determine the duration
   of aircrew exposure. When the ambient temperature drops below -50F, the SQ/CC or
   DETCO should consider recommending cancellation of flight activity to the C2 authority.
   5.13.2. DELETED
5.14. Pre-Flight.
   5.14.1. AFTO Form 781, AFORMS--Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document.                      The
   exceptional release must be signed before flight. Ensure that the Air Force fuel identaplate is
   aboard the aircraft.
 22                                                             AFI11-2RC-135V3 22 APRIL 2010


   5.14.2. Crewmembers may perform aircraft servicing duties when qualified maintenance
   support is not available. Crewmembers may augment maintenance refueling teams at en
   route stops.
   5.14.3. The aircraft commander will ensure aircrews that turn aircraft without qualified
   maintenance specialist assistance comply with the appropriate maintenance T.O. In addition,
   the aircraft commander will enter a red dash symbol in the Form 781H, updating current
   status, and enter a red dash symbol in a discrepancy that reflects that the applicable
   maintenance inspection (i.e. preflight, through-flight, basic post-flight) is overdue.
5.15. Departure.
   5.15.1. Mission departures are considered on time if the aircraft is airborne within plus or
   minus 30 minutes of scheduled takeoff time.
   5.15.2. Scheduled takeoff time may be adjusted as necessary to meet the rendezvous time.
   Notify scheduling and controlling agency of any deviations affecting the control time.
5.16. Navigation.
   5.16.1. The navigator is responsible for positional awareness at all times unless the pilots
   assume responsibility for navigation.
   5.16.2. Systems Cross Check. A systems cross check will be made as soon as practical after
   initial level-off. Systems cross checks are required, will normally not exceed 30 minutes
   throughout the flight and will be recorded.
      5.16.2.1. At a minimum, the navigator will compare the heading, position, and
      groundspeed of all applicable navigation equipment.
          5.16.2.1.1. Navigators should use a range and bearing from a known radar target to
          further confirm systems accuracy.
      5.16.2.2. If the cross check is accomplished at a planned turn point, and there are no
      discrepancies between the navigation systems and the Form 200, the systems cross check
      may be recorded by annotating the ATA on the Form 200.
      5.16.2.3. If the cross check is not accomplished at a planned turn point, the navigator
      will record the heading, position, groundspeed, and time of the position crosscheck on a
      station stamp or Form 200.
      5.16.2.4. Any discrepancy per RC/OC/WC/TC-135 (I)-1 tolerances, will be resolved by
      taking a radar fix, if available.
      5.16.2.5. The navigator will record any information not previously planned/briefed, i.e.
      weather deviation, mission profile change, etc, to permit accurate reconstruction of the
      aircraft position through the mission.
   5.16.3. Verify system accuracy prior to coupling the autopilot to any navigation computer
   system.
   5.16.4. The navigator will track all in-flight clearances.
   5.16.5. Navigation Symbols. Use standard symbols IAW AFPAM 11-216, Air Navigation.
AFI11-2RC-135V3 22 APRIL 2010                                                               23


  5.16.6. At AC discretion, crews may fly with a laptop capable of providing a moving map
  display, from an approved GPS source and must be approved for unrestricted use IAW AFI
  11-202V3, Chapter 5.
  5.16.7. Minimum Navigation Performance Specification (MNPS) Operations. Operations
  within the North Atlantic area’s MNPS airspace, Canadian minimum navigation performance
  specifications (CMNPS), or selected Pacific routes are designed for INS-autopilot coupled
  operation. (See FLIP AP/2, Chapter 5, and AFI 11-202V3, paragraph 2.16.5.) When not
  engaged in AR operations, aircrews will adhere to this procedure.
  5.16.8. Required Navigation Performance Area Navigation (RNP RNAV) Airspace.
     5.16.8.1. RNP-10. Compliance includes navigation accuracy within 10NM of actual
     position 95% of the time. The TC/RC-135 is approved for RNP-10 operations.
     5.16.8.2. RNP-5/Basic Area Navigation (BRNAV) Airspace. Basic Area Navigation
     (BRNAV) navigation accuracy criteria is RNP-5. The TC/RC-135 is approved for RNP-
     5/BRNAV operations.
     5.16.8.3. Minimum equipment to operate in RNP-10/RNP-5/BRNAV airspace is a LN-
     120 with at least stellar updates or one FMS with GPS. Flights entering RNP-5 airspace
     after a long overwater flight must be especially aware of tighter tolerances and update
     accordingly.
     5.16.8.4. Aircraft unable to maintain RNP/BRNAV tolerances must advise ATC
     immediately and take appropriate coordinated action.
  5.16.9. Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace. Airspace where RVSM
  is applied is considered special qualification airspace. Both the aircrew and the specific
  aircraft must be approved for operations in these areas. Refer to FLIP GP and the following
  guidance for RVSM requirements.
     5.16.9.1. The RC/TC-135 is approved for unrestricted RVSM operation and requires the
     following:
         5.16.9.1.1. Two independent certified altitude measurement systems supplied by
         independent pressure sources.
         5.16.9.1.2. One automatic altitude keeping device (autopilot with operational altitude
         hold function).
         5.16.9.1.3. One altitude alerter.
         5.16.9.1.4. A fully operable IFF transponder
     5.16.9.2. See FLIGHT DISPLAYS/INSTRUMENTS in Section III of applicable T.O. if
     there is a malfunction of any of these systems. Should any RVSM equipment fail prior to
     or after entering RVSM airspace advise ATC and request a new clearance.
     5.16.9.3. It is the MAJCOM’s responsibility to maintain the specific aircraft
     certification.
  5.16.10. Document (in the aircraft forms) malfunctions or failures of MNPS, RVSM or
  RNP/BRNAV required equipment.
24                                                      AFI11-2RC-135V3 22 APRIL 2010


  5.16.11. RC/TC-135 CNS/ATM (Communications Navigation Surveillance / Air Traffic
  Management) and Safety Compliance.
     5.16.11.1. CNS/ATM is an umbrella term used to describe the emerging technologies
     and architecture of space and ground based systems designed to enhance air traffic
     system capacity, flight efficiency, and both ground and cockpit situational awareness
     while continuing to meet flight safety standards. During mission planning, aircrews
     should familiarize themselves with the CNS/ATM requirements of the airspace that they
     plan to operate in.
     5.16.11.2. Some CNS/ATM initiatives require aircrew training in addition to aircraft
     certification.
     5.16.11.3. Malfunctioning equipment that reduces the aircrew’s capability to comply
     with CNS/ATM requirements of a particular airspace may prevent entering and/or
     continuing operation in the airspace.
     5.16.11.4. RC/TC-135 aircraft comply with the following functional and performance
     criteria for the communication, lateral and vertical navigation, surveillance, and safety
     requirements of appropriate FAA Advisory Circulars (AC) and Technical Standard
     Orders (TSO), ICAO standards, and Air Force Instructions or provide an equivalent level
     of safety and performance.
     5.16.11.5. Communications.
        5.16.11.5.1. VHF voice radios are 8.33 kHz channel spacing compliant.
        5.16.11.5.2. VHF-NAV (VOR/ILS) navigation and VHF voice radios are FM
        Immunity (FMI) compliant.
        5.16.11.5.3. HF voice radios are compliant with USAF over water requirements.
     5.16.11.6. Lateral Navigation (FMS).
        5.16.11.6.1. Each Flight Management System (FMS) complies with the requirements
        for U.S. RNAV (Area Navigation) System operations (RNAV Departures (RNAV 1),
        RNAV routes (RNAV 2), RNAV STARS (RNAV 1), and RNAV (GPS) approaches
        including RNAV substitution of legacy equipment procedures. The FMSs are cleared
        for RNAV Point-to-Point and worldwide RNP-5/RNP-10/BRNAV (Required
        Navigation Performance/ European Basic Area Navigation)/PRNAV operations
        without time limitations with properly operating GPS.
        5.16.11.6.2. While the FMSs meet the navigational performance required for RNP-4
        operations, the RC/TC-135 does not meet the communications (CPDLC) or
        surveillance (ADS-B) requirements for RNP-4.
        5.16.11.6.3. For RNP and RNAV compliance the EFIS/FMS CDU should not display
        any of the following: GPS INTEGRITY, GPS#X NOT NAV, GPS#X FAILED,
        GPS#X DESELECT.
        5.16.11.6.4. For RNP and RNAV compliance, if any GPS satellites will be out of
        service during the flight, the crew should conduct RAIM predictions prior to flight.
        Any satellites which will be out of service during the flight should be excluded from
AFI11-2RC-135V3 22 APRIL 2010                                                                 25


        RAIM predictions. A gap in preflight RAIM prediction of up to 5 minutes is
        acceptable.
        5.16.11.6.5. For RNAV terminal area procedures including RNAV substitution of
        legacy equipment procedures (NDB, VOR) the procedure must be retrieved in its
        entirety from the aircraft database and the database must be current. The FMS
        Navigation Database is a commercial database provided by Jeppesen.
        5.16.11.6.6. For RNAV 1 or RNAV 2 operations, FMS guidance must be used and
        the aircrew should verify the FMS is set to the appropriate RNP. Use of the autopilot
        or flight director are required for RNAV 1 operations (ODPs, SIDS & STARS) and
        recommended for RNAV 2 operations.
     5.16.11.7. Lateral Navigation (LN-20).
        5.16.11.7.1. For degraded systems operations refer to aircraft Technical Orders for
        aircraft RNP airspace performance.
        5.16.11.7.2. The crew should notify ATC of conditions (equipment failure and
        weather conditions) that may affect the ability of the aircraft to maintain position with
        the designated RNP airspace.
     5.16.11.8. Navigation Databases.
        5.16.11.8.1. Two separate navigational databases (DAFIF and Jeppesen) are used in
        the TC/RC-135. These navigation databases are updated on a 28-day cycle.
        5.16.11.8.2. Flight Plans are created from flight planning software using navigation
        data from the Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF). These flight
        plans maybe saved to a portable storage medium. Crewmembers are responsible for
        ensuring the accuracy of flight plan waypoints against current aeronautical charts,
        terminal instrument procedures, or FLIP documents. The crew must also resolve any
        discrepancies between the DAFIF and the FMS databases.
        5.16.11.8.3. The FMS Navigation Database is provided by a commercial vendor,
        Jeppesen. The current and next databases are stored in each FMS. When a terminal
        area procedure (departure procedure, STAR, instrument approach procedure) will be
        flown using FMS as the sole source of navigation information, the procedure to be
        flown must be retrieved in its entirety from the aircraft database and the database
        must be current.
        5.16.11.8.4. Both the DAFIF and Jeppesen databases are based on the WGS-84
        coordinate system. FMS approaches should not be flown in areas of the world that do
        not conform to the WGS-84 coordinate system (or equivalent).
     5.16.11.9. Vertical Navigation (VNAV).
        5.16.11.9.1. The FMSs meet the requirements for VFR/IFR enroute, terminal area
        and approach VNAV operation WORLDWIDE. The VNAV function provides
        deviation from the vertical path only and is not coupled to the autopilot. The lowest
        allowable approach minima on RNAV approaches is LNAV/VNAV DA due to the
        certified VNAV functionality to use LNAV/VNAV minimums. All RC/TC¬135
        aircraft are certified to fly approaches to LNAV/VNAV minimums using the
26                                                   AFI11-2RC-135V3 22 APRIL 2010


        “pseudo¬glideslope" displayed on the ADI. LNAV/VNAV will be flown to a DA
        (Decision Altitude). LNAV approaches only requires lateral navigation and will be
        flown to an MDA (Minimum Descent Altitude). The requirement for Wide-Area
        Augmentation System (WAAS) support to use LPV minimums is met only on the
        WC-135 and future RC-135 aircraft with Baseline Bravo (BL-B) avionic packages.
        See Advisory Circular (AC) 90-100A for further information.

AFI11-2RC-135V3 22 APRIL 2010                                                                  27


                                                                      through WAAS.
          5.16.11.9.2. Barometric vertical navigation is temperature compensated.
       5.16.11.10. Surveillance.
          5.16.11.10.1. The RC/TC-135 transponder is compliant with Mode S (Select)
          Elementary Surveillance (ELS) and Enhanced Surveillance (EHS) and Traffic Alert
          and Collision Avoidance System II (TCAS II) version 7.0 requirements.
          5.16.11.10.2. Mode S establishes selective and addressed interrogations with aircraft
          within its coverage. Such selective ATC interrogations improve the quality and
          integrity of detection, identification and altitude reporting. These improvements
          translate into benefits in terms of safety, capacity and efficiency.
          5.16.11.10.3. Mode S (ELS) transmits a 24 bit aircraft address, SSR Mode 3/A,
          Altitude in 25ft increments, Flight status (airborne or ground), data link capability,
          Ground Initiated Comm capability report, Aircraft ID, and TCAS capability. Crews
          will ensure that the 8 character (24 bit) Mode S address, SEE AIRPLANE MODE S
          OCTAL AND DATALINK CODING, page v., and the Aircraft ID (Call Sign) are
          correctly loaded in the IFF/SIF transponder during flight.
          5.16.11.10.4. Mode S (EHS) transmits an additional 8 downlink aircraft parameters
          (DAPs): selected altitude, roll angle, track angle rate, true track angle, ground speed,
          magnetic heading, indicated airspeed, and vertical rate.
       5.16.11.11. Safety.
          5.16.11.11.1. The Mode S address may be changed for operational purposes if
          directed by higher authority. Mode S is a civilian air traffic management system.
          Though military application may enhance OPSEC, ensure that the selected address
          does not interfere with air traffic management systems. Do not attempt to enter false
          aircraft data/parameters into the system or otherwise spoof the air traffic management
          system because this may create a safety hazard.
          5.16.11.11.2. The Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS) meets Forward-
          Looking Terrain-Avoidance (FLTA), Premature Decent Alert (PDA) and Ground
          Proximity Warning (GPWS Modes 1-6) requirements.
          5.16.11.11.3. The dual Aircraft Performance Computers (APCs) meet Windshear
          Caution and Warning requirements.
          5.16.11.11.4. The Emergency Avionics System (EAS) or 406 MHz ELT and
          FDR/CVR meets Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) and Flight Data Recorder
          (FDR) requirements.
5.17. Insect and Pest Control.
   5.17.1. Aircraft commanders will ensure required pest control is accomplished according to
   AFJI 48-104, Quarantine Regulations of the Armed Forces; DOD 4500.54-G, DOD Foreign
   Clearance Guide (FCG); or as directed by higher headquarters. Certify the spraying on
   Customs Form 7507 or on forms provided by the host country.

   5.17.2. When seeing any insect or rodent infestation of the aircraft inflight, notify the
   destination command and control agency, base operations, or airport manager of the situation
   before landing so the proper authorities can meet the aircraft.
   5.17.3. On arrival, open cargo doors or hatches to allow entry of officials required to inspect
   the aircraft for insect or rodent infestation or to de-plane the minimum number of
   crewmembers required to chock the aircraft. Do not load or unload cargo or passengers until
   the inspection is completed. This procedure may be altered to satisfy mission or local
   requirements.
5.18. Arresting Cables. (Does not include recessed cables)
   5.18.1. RC-135 aircraft will ensure all barriers and cables are removed prior to recovery. Do
   not land on approach end arresting cables. If the aircraft lands before the cable, the crew
   should contact the tower to have the cable inspected.
   5.18.2. If time or operational constraints dictate, the aircraft commander may taxi over
   approach end cables and use the remaining runway for takeoff provided the departure end
   cables have been removed and the AC recalculates TOLD using actual distance remaining.
5.19. Alert. Alert procedures will be initiated by the applicable squadron commander or
DETCO, when mission requirements require a quick response to HHQ taskings. The applicable
squadron commander is the waiver/modification authority for C-135 alert procedures.
   5.19.1. ALPHA Alert. Aircrew is capable of launching within one (1) hour of crew
   notification. Crews should be quartered near the alert aircraft with sufficient transportation
   to launch in accordance with mission timing. Crew members are given 12-hours of pre-alert
   crew rest. A crew will not stay on ALPHA alert duty for more than 48 hours. After 48
   hours, the crew must be launched, released, or entered into pre-departure crew rest. Crew
   duty begins when the AC is notified of the launch order.
   5.19.2. BRAVO Alert. Aircrew is capable of launching within four (4) hours of crew
   notification. Crew members are given 12-hours of pre-alert crew rest. After crew rest, they
   are placed on telephone standby. A crew will not stay on BRAVO alert duty for more than
   48 hours. After 48 hours, the crew must be launched, released, or entered into pre-departure
   crew rest. Crew duty begins when the AC is alerted for duty.

                                            Chapter 7

                               C-135--AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on aircraft security and preventing and resisting
aircraft piracy (hijacking) of C-135 aircraft. AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft
Piracy (Hijacking); AFI 31-101, Air Force Physical Security Program; and specific MAJCOM
security publications contain additional guidance. Aircrews will not release information
concerning hijacking attempts or identify armed aircrew members or missions to the public.
7.2. Security. The RC/WC-135 is designated a security protection level 2 (or equivalent)
resource when on alert as the result of EWO/OPLAN 8010 tasking, when deployed OCONUS, or
when SCI configured. It is a protection level 3 (or equivalent) resource at all other times. The
OC-135 is a protection level 3 when operational. It is a protection level 4 when used for training
or in depot status (reference AFI 31-101, ACC Sup). The TC-135 is not addressed in the 31-101,
but should be treated as a protection level 3 at all times. Aircraft security at non-US military
installations is the responsibility of the controlling agency. At contractor facilities, the RC/WC-
135 must receive the same level of security required for protection level 2 (or equivalent)
resources under AF control (reference AFI 31-101).
7.3. Air Force Physical Security Program. The following security procedures will implement
AFI 31-101, requirements for C-135 aircraft:
   7.3.1. Aircraft will be secured for the appropriate protection level IAW AFI 31-101.
   7.3.2. At non-US military installations, the aircraft commander determines the adequacy of
   local security capabilities to provide aircraft security commensurate with this volume. If he
   or she determines security to be inadequate, the aircraft will depart to a station where
   adequate security is available.
   7.3.3. The security force must be made aware of all visits to the aircraft.
   7.3.4. Security support is a continual requirement and is not negated by the presence of
   aircrew or ground crewmembers. Security force support terminates only after the aircraft
   doors are closed and the aircraft taxies.
   7.3.5. Ensure COMSEC and other classified materials are turned in at destination and
   receipts are obtained for COMSEC and classified material if not stored on the aircraft.
   Combat crew communications or appropriate command and control agency will provide
   temporary storage for COMSEC and other classified materials during enroute, turnaround,
   and crew rest stops.
   7.3.6. Ensure all modes and codes are zeroized and any classified route of flight is erased
   before leaving the aircraft, as applicable.
7.4. Enroute Security. The planning agency must coordinate with the execution agency to
ensure adequate en route security is available. Aircraft commanders will receive a threat
assessment and an enroute security capability evaluation briefing for areas of intended operation
prior to home station departure and should request updates from enroute C3 agencies as required.
If required, a mission security team (MST) will be assigned to the mission.
AFI11-2RC-135V3 22 APRIL 2010                                                                  31


  7.4.1. The MST normally consists of three US Air Force security forces personnel, but may
  include more depending on security requirements. The team travels in MEP status and is
  responsible to the aircraft commander at all times. Aircraft commanders are responsible for
  the team’s welfare (transportation, lodging, etc.). The aircraft commander will ensure MST
  members receive a full aircrew briefing.
  7.4.2. The aircraft commander will assess the local situation and take the following actions
  as required:
     7.4.2.1. Request area security post or patrols from local security forces commensurate
     with appropriate designated protection level. If local authorities request payment for this
     service, use AF Form 15, USAF Invoice.
     7.4.2.2. During short ground times, direct crewmembers to remain with the aircraft and
     maintain surveillance of aircraft entrances and activities in the aircraft vicinity.
     7.4.2.3. If local security forces are unavailable or are unacceptable to the aircraft
     commander and the crew has not been augmented with a MST, the aircraft commander
     may waive the flight duty period limits and crew rest requirements and depart as soon as
     possible for a base considered reliable. Report movement and intentions to the controlling
     agency as soon as practical. If departure is not possible, the aircrew must secure the
     aircraft to the best of their ability. In no case will the entire crew leave the aircraft
     unattended. Crew rest requirements will be subordinate to aircraft security when the
     airframe may be at risk. The aircraft commander should rotate a security detail among the
     crew to provide for both aircraft protection and crew rest until relief is available. Request
     security assistance from the nearest DOD installation, US Embassy, local military, or law
     enforcement agencies as appropriate.
  7.4.3. Unescorted entry is granted to aircrew members and support personnel assigned to the
  mission who possess their home station AF Form 1199, USAF Restricted Area Badge,
  supported by an EAL or aircrew orders. Aircrew members and assigned crew chiefs are
  authorized escort authority.
     7.4.3.1. Normally, non-US nationals, such as cargo handlers, can perform their duties
     under escort and should not be placed on the EAL.
     7.4.3.2. Personnel not identified in paragraph 7.4.3 must be escorted within the area.
  7.4.4. When parking on a secure ramp, the aircraft will normally be left unlocked to allow
  ground support personnel immediate access. If the aircraft commander determines that
  security is necessary (professional gear or personal items left on the aircraft), the crew will
  use only breakable seals (i.e. forestry service "boxcar" seals, safety wire, etc.).
     7.4.4.1. If ground personnel need to access a sealed aircraft, they will request permission
     from local command and control agency, which will log the breach in their logbook and
     notify the crew at alert time. Ground personnel will reseal the aircraft using similar
     means.
     7.4.4.2. If unauthorized entry is suspected or an unauthorized seal breakage occurs report
     via the appropriate Air Force-approved form for an aircraft commander’s report on
     services or facilities.

   7.4.5. When parking on a non-ACC ramp where the aircraft commander determines that
   security may be a problem, the aircraft will be sealed or locked using procedures in
   paragraph 7.5 If further security is required, other measures (SF teams, local security, etc.)
   will be utilized.
7.5. Detecting Unauthorized Entry. If, in the aircraft commander’s judgment, the aircraft
needs to be locked and sealed in order to detect unauthorized entry, then:
   7.5.1. Use available aircraft ground security locking devices.
   7.5.2. Secure the hatches and doors in a manner that will indicate unauthorized entry (e.g.,
   tape inside of doors and hatches to airframe so that entry pulls tape loose).
   7.5.3. Close and lock the main crew entrance door.
   7.5.4. Wipe the immediate area around lock and latches clean to aid in investigation of a
   forced entry.
   7.5.5. Report any unauthorized entry or tampering to the Office of Special Investigation
   (OSI), security forces or local authorities, and the C3 agency. Have aircraft thoroughly
   inspected prior to flight.

8.1. AR without Tanker Disconnect Capability. Without tanker disconnect capability means
the boom operator cannot trigger an immediate disconnect. Do not attempt further contacts with
a tanker after a known loss of tanker disconnect capability. EXCEPTIONS: Fuel emergency
situations, OPLAN 8010, airborne alert, receiver over water deployment or redeployment and
operational missions.
8.2. Manual/Emergency Boom Latching. To complete training or evaluation                          in
manual/emergency boom latching procedures, the following conditions must be met:
   8.2.1. An instructor pilot (IP) must directly supervise the receiver activity on board receiver
   aircraft.
   8.2.2. Contacts must be limited to the minimum required.
   8.2.3. Receiver AR system must be fully operable. Note: Receiver pilot and boom operator
   must coordinate all actions as required by applicable directives when making AR contacts
   during the situations listed above.
8.3. Prohibited Refueling Maneuvers. When operating in manual/emergency boom latching
or when the tanker does not have disconnect capability, the following maneuvers are prohibited:
   8.3.1. Practice emergency separation while in contact.
   8.3.2. Demonstration of boom envelope limits.
8.4. Practice Emergency Separation.
   8.4.1. Prior to actual accomplishment of a practice emergency separation, coordination is
   mandatory between the tanker pilot, boom operator, and receiver pilot on when the
   separation will occur and who will give the command for separation.
   8.4.2. If separation is initiated from the contact position, the receiver’s AR system must be in
   NORMAL and a boom operator initiated disconnect capability with the receiver must have
   been demonstrated.
   8.4.3. Practice emergency separations may be accomplished with passengers onboard.
8.5. Limits Demonstrations. Limits demonstrations will only be flown under direct IP
supervision.
8.6. Receiver Responsibilities.
   8.6.1. Squawk normal when separation from the tanker is greater than 3 miles.
   8.6.2. Receiver aircraft will maintain two-way radio contact with ATC until cleared to the
   AR block altitude and established in that block.
   8.6.3. Monitor position of AR formation ensuring compliance with ATC clearance or
   ALTRV.

   8.6.4. Receivers will establish communications with the tanker IAW ATP-56(B) Air-to-Air
   Refueling and applicable MDS T.O. Chapter 8, Air Refueling, to the maximum extent
   practical.
8.7. Communications Failure. Aircraft experiencing two-way communications failure during
the conduct of aerial refueling will continue flight in accordance with the following procedures:
   8.7.1. Squawk code 7600 for at least 2 minutes prior to exiting the track or anchor.
   8.7.2. Receiver aircraft that have not received altitude instructions beyond the exit point will
   exit the track or anchor at the lowest altitude specified in the clearance for the refueling
   portion of the flight and proceed in accordance with "Procedures for Two-Way Radio Failure
   IFR-VFR" as set forth in the En route Flight Information Handbook.
8.8. MARSA Applicability for AR. MARSA begins between tanker and receivers when the
tanker advises ATC that it is accepting MARSA. MARSA is not a recognized ICAO term. If in
doubt as to what separation is provided by ATC or what separation the aircrew is responsible for,
query the controlling agency.
   8.8.1. MARSA ends between tanker and receivers when the tanker advises ATC that tanker
   and receiver aircraft are vertically positioned within AR airspace and ATC advises MARSA
   is terminated.
   8.8.2. Controller-assigned course or altitude changes prior to rendezvous completion will
   automatically void MARSA and are to be avoided after MARSA has been declared.
   8.8.3. Headings and altitude assignments may be made with tanker concurrence with
   MARSA remaining in effect once the rendezvous is completed.
   8.8.4. Each tanker will keep receiver aircraft within 3 miles after rendezvous completion
   until MARSA is terminated.
AFI11-2RC-135V3 22 APRIL 2010                                                                  35

                                     MISSION PLANNING

9.1. Mission Development/Planning. The squadron (SQ) DO or Detachment Commander
(DETCO), if applicable, will actively direct the execution of the unit’s flying schedule. The DO
will ensure that all operations personnel provide crews with the requisite support to plan and
execute mission. The SQ/DO will ensure crews/mission planners have no barriers to mission
planning and ensure that every mission is thoroughly planned, briefed, executed, and debriefed.
The aircraft commander has overall responsibility for mission material accuracy and review.
9.2. Mission Planning. The SQ/DO will normally choose from two planning profiles when
directing the flying operation: mission plan/fly and show and go.
   9.2.1. Mission Plan/Fly. Mission planning is normally held the duty day prior to execution.
   9.2.2. Show and Go. Show and go profiles should not be used for initial qualification
   training. Show and go profile missions are planned by a Mission Planning Team (MPT).
       9.2.2.1. The MPT will be designated by the SQ/DO.
           9.2.2.1.1. All MPT members must be qualified in their crew positions but may be
           DNIF.
   9.2.3. Rivet Joint/Cobra Ball/Combat Sent: The TC has overall responsibility for mission
   crew mission planning and will ensure close coordination with the AMS.
9.3. Navigational Charts.
   9.3.1. Navigational charts will be annotated to reflect:
       9.3.1.1. Special use airspace, to include restricted and warning areas, within the altitude
       structure and within 50 nautical miles (NM) of the planned route of flight. Those portions
       of the route that are conducted on established airways by reference to FLIP enroute charts
       and pilot’s radio navigation instruments need not be annotated.
       9.3.1.2. Emergency airfields sufficient to cover the route of flight.
       9.3.1.3. High terrain within 50 NM of planned route of flight and 25 NM of departure
       and arrival base and minimum safe altitude for the entire route of flight.
       9.3.1.4. All applicable AR and mission information.
   9.3.2. Navigational charts will be at the navigator's and pilot's station.
9.4. Mission Planning Briefings. A recommended briefing guide is provided by 55 OG/OGV.
   9.4.1. Mission Planning Briefing. (Not required for Show and Go) SQ/CC or SQ/DO
   appointed individuals will brief the crew the day prior to the flight. The AC, CP, Nav, TC,
   and AMS will attend the mission planning brief, unless excused by the AC.
   9.4.2. Crew Briefing. The AC will ensure all crewmembers flying the sortie are briefed
   applicable information from the 55 OG Briefing Certificate. The AC/TC/AMS will ensure all
   crewmembers flying the sortie are briefed applicable information. All crewmembers flying
   the mission will attend unless excused by AC.

     9.4.2.1. The mission will be rebriefed when the time interval from the summary briefing
     to the crew report time exceeds 72 hours. The 72-hour rebrief will cover applicable
     summary briefing items.
  9.4.3. Step Briefing. All crewmembers flying the mission will attend unless excused by
  SQ/DO or designated representative.
  9.4.4. Mission Debrief.
     9.4.4.1. The entire crew will conduct a mission debrief, as soon as practical, unless
     excused by the AC.
     9.4.4.2. The maintenance debrief will be conducted as soon as practical after engine
     shutdown. Attendance at the maintenance debrief is as directed by the AC.

Administrative Control—Direction or exercise of authority over subordinate or other
organizations in respect to administration and support, including organization of Service forces,
control of resources and equipment, personnel management, unit logistics, individual and unit
training, readiness, mobilization, demobilization, discipline, and other matters not included in the
operational missions of the subordinate or other organizations. Also called ADCON.
Augmented Crew—Basic aircrew supplemented by additional qualified aircrew members to
permit in-flight rest periods.
Combatant Command—A unified or specified command with a broad continuing mission
under a single commander established and so designated by the President, through the Secretary
of Defense and with the advice and assistance of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Combatant commands typically have geographic or functional responsibilities.
Combatant Command (command authority)—Nontransferable command authority
established by title 10 ("Armed Forces"), United States Code, section 164, exercised only by
commanders of unified or specified combatant commands unless otherwise directed by the
President or the Secretary of Defense. Combatant command (command authority) cannot be
delegated and is the authority of the combatant commander to perform those functions of
command over assigned forces involving organizing and employing commands and forces,
assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving authoritative direction over all aspects of
military operations, joint training, and logistics necessary to accomplish the missions assigned to
the command. Combatant command (command authority) should be exercised through the
commanders of subordinate organizations. Normally this authority is exercised though
subordinate joint force commanders and service and/or functional component commanders.
Combatant command (command authority) provides full authority to organize and employ
commands and forces, as the combatant commander considers necessary to accomplish assigned
missions. Operational control is inherent in combatant command (command authority). Also
called COCOM.
Critical Phases of Flight—Takeoff, air refueling, approach to landing, landing, flight
maneuvers that require direct instructor supervision, and designated formal training unit (FTU),
CTS or CFIC only maneuvers. Approaches to planned missed approaches and air refueling
rendezvous are not considered critical phases of flight. This definition applies only to this AFI.
Delay—Failure of an aircraft to depart due to maintenance or operational reasons at the
scheduled departure time plus 30 minutes.
Execution—Command-level approval for initiation of a mission or portion thereof after due
consideration of all pertinent factors. Execution authority is restricted to designated command
authority.
Experienced Crewmember—Requirements listed in AFI 11-2RC-135V1, Aircrew Training.
Individual must also be designated "experienced" by the squadron commander.
Fuel Reserve—Amount of usable fuel carried beyond that required to complete the flight as
planned.
Ground Time—Interval between arrival in the blocks and next takeoff time.
HHQ Missions—Missions executed at or above the NAF. HHQ missions include: deployment,
redeployment, reconnaissance operations, Open Skies Joint Trial/Treaty Flights, ORIs, and PDM
AFI11-2RC-135V3 22 APRIL 2010                                                                     41


input/output. Exercise missions flown in support of HHD exercise, example GREEN FLAG,
COPE THUNDER, FLEETEX, etc., are also considered HHQ missions as well as exercise
support to classified users or executed as directed on an operational or exercise Air Tasking
Order.
Initial Level-Off—The time (Greenwich Mean Time [GMT]) the aircraft completes a published
departure (i.e. SID) or radar vector departure and reaches planned or final en route altitude.
Mission—Movement of aircraft from a designated point of origin to a designated destination as
defined by assigned mission identifier, mission nickname, or both in the schedule, mission
directive, OPORD or OPLAN.
Operational Control—Transferable command authority that may be exercised by commanders
at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Operational control is inherent in
combatant command (command authority). Operational control may be delegated and is the
authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate forces involving organizing
and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving
authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training necessary to
accomplish missions assigned to the command. Operational control should be exercised through
the commanders of subordinate organizations. Normally this authority is exercised through
subordinate joint force commanders and service and/or functional component commanders.
Operational control normally provides full authority to organize commands and forces and to
employ those forces, as the commander in operational control considers necessary to accomplish
assigned missions. Operational control does not, in and of itself, include authoritative direction
for logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal organization, or unit training. Also
called OPCON.
Over-Water Flight—Any flight that exceeds power-off gliding distance from land.
Primary Position—Any seat in which you can log “Primary flight time” per AFI 11-401: ―Log
primary flight time only when performing duties at a duty position established for that specialty.
(i.e. Instructor seats and crew rest seats are not considered primary positions, with the exception
of ASE’s).
Scheduled Takeoff Time—Takeoff time as established in the schedule or operations order
(OPORD).
Show and Go—Sortie in which the mission planning is performed by a mission planning team,
while the crew shows at the step brief, takes the mission planned information and paperwork and
flies the sortie.
Tactical Control—Command authority over assigned or attached forces or commands, or
military capability or forces made available for tasking, that is limited to the detailed and,
usually, local direction and control of movements or maneuvers necessary to accomplish
missions or tasks assigned. Tactical control is inherent in operational control. Tactical control
may be delegated to, and exercised at any level at or below the level of combatant command.
Also called TACON.
Tasked Squadron—The squadron that is scheduled to fly the RELAY.
Training Mission—Mission executed at the unit level for the sole purpose of aircrew training
for upgrade or proficiency. Does not include operational missions as defined in this volume.
