                                             Chapter 1

                                STUDENT ADMINISTRATION

1.1. Casual Student Officer Management:
     1.1.1. General. Casual student officers are those who have reported to their assigned joint
     specialized UPT (JSUPT)/ENJJPT base and are awaiting training. AFPC/DPSIP uses a
     computer program to efficiently schedule casual student officers for initial flight screening
     (IFS) (if needed) and JSUPT/ENJJPT and to minimize their “casual” time prior to entering
     the training pipeline.
     1.1.2. Roles and Responsibilities:
        1.1.2.1. The student squadron (STUS) manages all casual student officers. At ENJJPT,
        the operational support squadron (OSS) is responsible for casual student officer
        management. For JSUPT-H at Fort Rucker, the flying training squadron commander
        (FTS/CC) manages casual student officers. Note: Substitute the corresponding OSS or
        FTS position as appropriate for all STUS references in this chapter.
        1.1.2.2. Wings will not change any IFS or UPT training dates. Each wing will develop a
        list of “hot spares,” primarily Officer Training School graduates, who have completed
        IFS. The purpose of “hot spares” is to fill any JSUPT training slot that may go unfilled
        as a result of higher than anticipated IFS attrition. If a student requires adjustment to the
        assigned training dates, the STUS supervisor will contact AFPC/DPSIPS at DSN 665-
        2102 for resolution.
        1.1.2.3. The STUS/CC or designated STUS supervisor will:
        1.1.2.3. (COLUMBUSAFB) Authority for management and temporary duty assignment
        of transition officers has been delegated by the 14 STUS/CC to the 14 STUS/DOA flight
        commander. Transition officer temporary duty assignment may include duty at another
        base agency or alternate duty location; however, the STUS/DOA flight commander
        retains the authority to recall or reassign transition officers at any time.
            1.1.2.3.1. Categorize casual student officers based on the time between their report
            date and their UPT class start date. Short-term (90 calendar days or less) casual
            student officers will stay in the operations group to ensure completion of all in-
            processing, temporary duties (TDY), and PCS requirements, and will only fill short-
            term or one-time manpower requirements.
            1.1.2.3.2. Attempt to detail long-term (more than 90 calendar days) casual student
            officers within the operations group. If a place in the group is not available, these
            officers may be detailed throughout the wing.
            1.1.2.3.3. Relieve casual student officers from all details 10 calendar days prior to
            their UPT class start date.
            1.1.2.3.4. Place UPT eliminees on casual status until they depart the base for a
            permanent change of station (PCS).
AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013                                                9


  1.1.3. Accountability. Casual student officers are valuable Air Force members, and the
  STUS must maintain accountability. The STUS/CC maintains administrative control
  (ADCON) over all casual student officers, regardless of the unit they support. The STUS/CC
  will ensure casual student officers are ready to start scheduled training, provide continuing
  professional development, and motivate students for their flying careers. ADCON includes,
  but is not limited to, the following actions:
     1.1.3.1. Disciplinary Action. The STUS/CC is the first level authority for all Uniform
     Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) actions.
         1.1.3.1.1. The STUS/CC will monitor each casual student officer’s performance from
         the date of arrival until departing the base for his or her follow-on assignment.
         1.1.3.1.2. If prior to entry into UPT, a casual student officer's performance or
         conduct becomes questionable and the STUS/CC believes the student should be
         removed from the pilot training selection list for cause, the STUS/CC will notify
         AETC/A3FP.
         1.1.3.1.3. Commanders of casual student officers awaiting training at U.S. Naval
         bases (for example, Naval Air Station [NAS] Whiting Field) will follow the process
         as prescribed in the current Memorandum of Understanding Between US Air Force
         Air Education and Training Command and US Navy Chief of Naval Air Training
         (hereinafter referred to as the AETC-CNATRA MOU).
         1.1.3.1.4. The wing commander (WG/CC) will determine if a casual student officer
         should be removed from the pilot training selection list for cause based on the
         respective subordinate commander’s recommendation and the totality of the
         circumstances. When the misconduct is serious enough to warrant discharge from
         service under AFI 36-3206, Administrative Discharge Procedures for Commissioned
         Officers, the responsible AETC show-cause authority initiates discharge action.
         Refer to AFI 36-3207, Separating Commissioned Officers, for additional
         administrative procedures. Provide information to AFPC/DPSIP as required by AFI
         36-2110, Assignments, paragraph 2.41.2, for officers eliminated from flying training.
         In addition, notify AETC/A3RA and AETC/A3FP.
     1.1.3.2. Recalls. Casual student officers will report to their STUS supervisor according
     to the recall option for accountability and sign-in prior to reporting to their duty
     assignment.
     1.1.3.3. Duty Hours. Casual student officer duty supervisors are responsible for
     maintaining accountability of the casual student officers during all duty periods.
     1.1.3.4. Mentoring. All casual student officers will be present for mentoring sessions
     set by their STUS supervisor, as required. Students will be released back to their duty
     assignments upon completion.
         1.1.3.4.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) All casual officers are required to attend the
         weekly mentorship meeting, held normally at 0830 on the first duty day of the week
         at Phillips/Kaye Auditorium.
     1.1.3.5. Mishap Reporting. Casual student officer duty supervisors will notify the
     STUS supervisor of any on- or off-duty mishap. If the duty supervisor completes an
10                          AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013


     AETC Form 435, Mishap Data Worksheet, route it through the STUS supervisor and the
     STUS/CC.
     1.1.3.6. Squadron Commander Calls/Safety Meetings. Release casual student officers
     to attend all STUS/CC calls and safety meetings unless their duty is mission critical and
     their absence is coordinated with their STUS supervisor.
        1.1.3.6.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Casual officers will be released from
        assigned duty for all 14 FTW, 14 OG, and 14 STUS Commanders’ Calls and safety
        meetings unless their duty is mission critical and the absence is coordinated with their
        STUS supervisor.
     1.1.3.7. Letter of Evaluation (LOE). Duty supervisors of casual student officers are
     highly encouraged to complete an optional LOE, which is the appropriate tool to capture
     a casual student officer’s performance. While the optional LOE is not filed in the
     selection record, it provides performance information to the subsequent rater for
     consideration when accomplishing the follow-on report (training or evaluation report).
     Officers may include their LOE in a letter to the board (for example, central selection
     board, force-shaping board, etc.), if convened prior to their next evaluation. In addition
     to LOEs, excellent performance can be documented with a decoration that will become a
     part of the selection record. By completing optional LOEs, a level playing field is
     maintained among all students, regardless of casual status duties. LOEs and decorations
     will be routed through the STUS supervisor for STUS/CC recommendation and approval.
        1.1.3.7.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Duty supervisors will provide casual officers
        with performance feedback and LOEs as appropriate. LOEs are routed through 14
        STUS/DOA and the 14 STUS/CCE for the 14 STUS/CC’s potential recommendation
        for an award.
        1.1.3.7.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Air Force medals are encouraged where
        warranted. There are no requirements for a decoration/award. However, if an officer
        warrants recognition, the award or decoration will be written and coordinated by the
        temporary duty supervisor. Approval authority for the AFAM and AFCM is the
        OG/CC.
     1.1.3.8. Leave. Casual student officers will coordinate leave and pass requests through
     their duty supervisor prior to submitting them to their STUS supervisor for approval.
     1.1.3.9. Physical Training (PT). Casual student officers will participate in the STUS
     fitness program.
     1.1.3.10. Supervisors. The JSUPT T-6A class commander or T-6A ENJJPT military
     training officer (MTO) assumes supervisory responsibility for the students during the
     primary phases of UPT. The JSUPT T-38C/T-1A class commander or T-38C ENJJPT
     MTO assumes supervisory responsibility during the advanced phase of UPT. The STUS
     will supervise UPT eliminees until they PCS from the base. During each transfer of
     supervisory responsibilities, the losing supervisor will brief the gaining supervisor on
     each student’s progress, potential, and any problems affecting the student’s training.
     1.1.3.11. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Off-Duty            Employment        for    Transition
     Officers. Off-duty employment or business activity while in transition status must be
AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013                                                 11


       approved by the 14 STUS/DOA flight commander prior to its occurrence (Refer to DOD
       5500.7-R Section 3-304c, Prior Approval of Outside Employment and Business
       Activities).
1.2. Course Entry Administration. Units will review incoming student records to verify they
are complete. Students must meet course entry prerequisites established in the syllabus. If a
student does not meet the course entry prerequisites, contact AETC/A3FP before entering the
student into training. As a minimum, units will review the following student records (or their
equivalents) prior to any formal training:
   1.2.1. Standardization/Evaluation (Stan/Eval) Records. These records are maintained in
   the flight evaluation folder (FEF). Depending on aircrew specialty, some individuals may
   not yet possess an FEF. Students should hand-carry FEFs to training according to the
   education and training course announcements (ETCA) course requirements. If required,
   flying training units forward applicable AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, and
   other stan/eval records and documents to the student’s home or gaining unit upon completion
   of training.
       1.2.1.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Students processing in who have a flight
       evaluation folder from a previous assignment will file it with the HARM office for the
       duration of SUPT.
   1.2.2. Training Folders or Records from Previous Courses (Pipeline students only).
   Pipeline students are those students who have not yet transferred PCS to an operational unit
   as permanent party members. If training records are not available, contact AETC/A3FP.
   1.2.3. Training Summaries (AETC Form 1122 Series) and Student Biographies. The
   squadron commander (SQ/CC), squadron operations officer (SQ/DO), flight commander
   (FLT/CC), or designated representative should review all training summaries and student
   biographies included in the student training record.
1.3. Quota Management. The programmed flying training (PFT) document establishes the
baseline for student quota management, which reflects real-time changes and are the AETC
aircrew training primary source documents for class entry dates, student load, and production
schedule information. AETC/A3RA maintains the quota management worksheets. These
worksheets are available at https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-
OP-AE-57). AETC provides class quotas annually via electronic PFT pages. AETC/A3RA
notifies affected units when quotas change.
   1.3.1. Units should obtain class entry rosters from the Military Personnel Data System
   Oracle Training Administration or the Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System
   not later than two weeks before class entry. Obtain rosters as early as possible to allow
   identification of excess capacity. Contact AETC/A3RA and AFPC/DPPAO to fill excess
   capacity if identified with adequate lead time.
   1.3.2. Units will report roster discrepancies as soon as they are discovered but no later than
   three duty days following the class start date. Report changes, discrepancies, and graduation
   delays to AETC/A3RA, AFPC/DPPAO and AETC/A3FP. In addition, report graduation
   delays and changes impacting track/aircraft assignment to AFPC/DPAOT.

1.4. Production Metrics Report. AETC/A3RB is the point of contact (POC) for flying training
production metrics. At the beginning of each fiscal year, AETC/A3RB uploads the PFT
document to the flying training production analysis (FTPA) web-based input tool. The
operations group commander (OG/CC) or designated POC will update the FTPA with actual
entries, gains, losses, attritions, graduate numbers and notes, if applicable. For JSUPT only,
class demographics for entries, graduates, and attritions are required for each phase. These
updates are due five duty days after the class start date and class graduation date.
1.5. Courseware Distribution.
   1.5.1. The merit assignment selection system (MASS) requires equal access to training
   materials for all students. Therefore, do not distribute or allow access to UPT courseware
   until students officially enter into a formal flying training program. This restriction includes
   all U.S. Air Force, AFRC, ANG, USN and U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) students.
   Simultaneously distribute courseware to all students as they enter training. Exception:
   International students may receive early distribution.
   1.5.2. Do not distribute or allow access to UPT courseware to U.S. Air Force, AFRC, ANG,
   USN and USMC personnel awaiting training. This restriction includes casual students,
   recent U.S. Air Force Academy or Reserve Officer Training Corps graduates, and any other
   person not yet officially entered into UPT.
1.6. Academic Training Scheduling. UPT students do not receive more than six hours of
testable classroom and computer-assisted instruction for academic subjects per day. Graduate
students may receive up to eight hours per day. Examinations are considered testable material.
1.7. Special Reporting Procedures for ANG and AFRC Students. SQ/CCs will ensure the
following actions are taken: (Note: This reporting is exempt from reports control symbol
reporting according to AFI 33-324, The Information Collections and Reports Management
Program; Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency Air Force Information Collections.)
   1.7.1. For ANG or AFRC Students Experiencing Difficulty:
       1.7.1.1. Units will notify AETC/A3G (for ANG) or AETC/A3H (for AFRC), as
       appropriate, via electronic mail (E-mail) when an ANG or AFRC student requires a
       progress check (PC) or an elimination check (EC), enters the commander’s review (CR)
       process, is placed on administrative hold, or is eliminated from or reinstated in training.
       In addition, notify AETC/A3G or AETC/A3H, as appropriate, when a student washes
       back a class or there is reasonable doubt about a student’s potential to complete a training
       syllabus. Include the student’s home unit and NGB/A3O or NGB/A3OC, or
       AFRC/A3TB, as applicable, as addressees on the E-mails.
       1.7.1.2. Students experiencing difficulty may include those assigned to a fighter unit who
       lack the potential to complete follow-on fighter training. Under these circumstances,
       refer to paragraph 1.7.2 for the administrative review process.
   1.7.2. For ANG and AFRC JSUPT Fighter-Bound Students.
       1.7.2.1. The OG/CC, SQ/CC, FLT/CC, and ENJJPT MTO will review an ANG or AFRC
       student’s training if the student falls to the bottom half of the class five weeks prior to
       track select (primary phase) or any time the student lacks the potential to complete
       follow-on training (primary or advanced phase).

      1.7.2.2. If the review determines the student lacks the potential to complete follow-on
      training, the OG/CC will inform the student’s home unit, AETC/A3R, AETC/A3F,
      AETC/A3G or AETC/A3H, and NGB/A3O and NGB/A3OC or AFRC/A1 and AFRC/A3
      by E-mail. NGB/A3O or AFRC/A3 then must make one of the following decisions: (1)
      continue training; (2) request a change from AETC/A3RA (prior to the start of the
      advanced phase) to a track other than T-38Cs, and continue training with a change in
      assignment to a non-fighter unit if the training change request is approved; or (3) remove
      the student from training. Once a decision is made, NGB/A3O or AFRC/A3 will pass the
      decision on to AETC/A3R, AETC/A3F, AETC/A3G or AETC/A3H. If the student’s
      track is changed, NGB/A3OC or AFRC/A3TB will notify AETC/A3RA. AETC/A3RA
      will notify the base via the track-select process.
   1.7.3. Graduation Notification. If the PFT graduation date changes, units will notify the
   student’s home unit and NGB/A3OC or AFRC/A3TB of the student’s new graduation date
   by E-mail no later than 30 calendar days before the new date. When it appears a student may
   graduate late, notify the student’s home unit as soon as possible. Send an information copy
   to AETC/A3G or AETC/A3H, as appropriate.
1.8. Physical Training (PT) Program. Students participate in a scheduled PT program
according to the appropriate syllabus; AFI 36-2905, Fitness Program; AETCI 11-406, Fighter
Aircrew Conditioning Program (FACP); and AFPAM 11-419, G-Awareness for Aircrew.
   1.8.1. U.S. Air Force UPT students will take the Air Force Fitness Assessment (FA)
   according to AFI 36-2905 during the preflight phase. Students who tested in all four
   components and scored an “excellent” (90 or above) on their latest FA are not required to test
   during the preflight phase unless their one year FA currency will expire during T-6A
   training. Enter students who fail the FA into a conditioning program according to AFI 36-
   2905 and retest. If students have not passed the FA by the completion of the preflight phase,
   STUS/CC will:
      1.8.1.1. Remove them from training and place on administrative hold status until passing
      the FA.
      1.8.1.2. Notify AETC/A3FP (reference paragraph 1.10.2).
      1.8.1.3. Enter them into the CR process and notify AETC/A3FP if after 90 calendar days
      they still have not passed the FA.
   1.8.2. All U.S. Air Force UPT students will take the Air Force FA according to AFI 36-2905
   during the advanced phase (T-38C, T-1A, or TH-1H). Students will not graduate, nor be
   awarded an aviation rating without a current Excellent/Satisfactory score. In addition to the
   requirements in AFI 36-2905, continue students with an Unsatisfactory FA score in training,
   but place them on administrative hold prior to class graduation. These students will either
   pass the FA and graduate, or be eliminated from training through a CR. The unit will notify
   AETC/A3FP if a student does not pass the FA by the scheduled class graduation date
   (reference paragraph 1.10.2).
   1.8.3. Group (flight, class, etc.) physical training is highly encouraged to build esprit de
   corps, but it is not required. Units will document PT accomplishments and ensure
   compliance by each student.
 14                            AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013


       1.8.3.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) During SUPT, students will document required PT
       sessions on an AF Form 4293, Student Activity Record. While in DOA or DOG, officers
       will be afforded the opportunity to PT.
   1.8.4. For U.S. Air Force students in USN undergraduate pilot training programs, physical
   fitness requirements are found in the current AETC-CNATRA MOU. Air Force and Navy
   personnel participate in local base physical fitness programs as prescribed in their course
   syllabuses. During the testing cycle, Navy students must pass the Navy physical readiness
   test and Air Force students must pass the Air Force FA according to AFI 36-2905.
   1.8.5. All students (including those at USN/ENJJPT training) must have a current FA with a
   passing score to attend survival, evasion, resistance, and escape training after graduation
   from UPT.
   1.8.6. Students enrolled in graduate TDY flying training courses must maintain fitness
   standards according to AFI 36-2905. They are encouraged to participate in host unit
   programs or complete three sessions of physical training per week.
   1.8.7. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Class flight commanders should attempt to be trained
   PTLs for practice tests.
   1.8.8. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) If a student earns an excellent score in Preflight Phase,
   he/she will be exempt from the 6 month testing requirement. If a student earns a passing but
   less than excellent score in Preflight Phase, he/she will normally be tested toward the end of
   Primary Phase. The Advanced Phase testing requirement will normally be scheduled at the
   end of Advanced Phase in order to ensure currency for follow-on training. If a student fails a
   PT test, he/she will immediately notify their supervisor.
1.9. Weight-for-Flight Standards. AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards,
establishes weight-for-flight standards for flying in ejection-seat aircraft. Prior to their first
flight, units will brief students on the capabilities and limitations of the ejection seats in their
unit’s aircraft. Students in training who are outside the weight-for-flight range are given until
they reach the flight line to get their weight into the proper range. Enter undergraduate students
who do not meet the weight for flight standards in the CR process and notify AETC/A3FP
(reference paragraph 1.10.2). Comply with AFI 48-123 for graduate students.
1.10. Administrative Hold. Units will place students on administrative hold whose training has
been suspended for other than medical reasons for more than seven calendar days. Units should
use administrative hold judiciously for extenuating circumstances, to include family serious
illness or death, or other personal problems beyond the individual’s control. Units will notify the
host aviation resource management (HARM) office and the registrar of all administrative hold
actions. The registrar will update the student’s status in OTA (if required) to reflect the student
status codes. Refer to AETCI 36-2205, Volume 1, Formal Aircrew Training Administration and
Management, for administrative hold procedures for medical reasons.
   1.10.1. Unit will notify AETC/A3FP (AETC.A3FP@us.af.mil) when:
       1.10.1.1. UPT or PCS-to-training graduate students are on administrative hold for more
       than 30 calendar days, or may reach this threshold (reference paragraph 1.11.2).
       1.10.1.2. TDY-to-school funded students have a training delay over seven calendar days
       (reference paragraph 1.11.3).

      1.10.2.2. Current class and scheduled course completion/graduation date
      1.10.2.3. Date placed on hold and reason for training delay
      1.10.2.4. Expected return to training date (Update AETC/A3FP if this date changes.)
   1.10.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Initiation of Administrative Hold. Admin hold
   should be used judiciously for extenuating circumstances to include family serious
   illness/death or other personal problems beyond the individual’s control. The class flight
   commander will initiate or coordinate the admin hold process to include notification of the
   student registrar (14 STUS/DOR). While on admin hold status, the class flight commander
   maintains ADCON while DOA assigns the student to a temporary job as required. In
   addition, the class flight commander maintains the student’s military training folder (MTF) in
   a secure location in the STUS.
      1.10.3.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Admin Hold for Medical Reasons. Coordinate
      recommendation for admin hold for medical reasons on the 31st day of DNIF IAW
      AETCI 36-2205V4 and AETCI 48-102, Medical Management of Undergraduate Flying
      Training Students and use the AF Form 4293 for the TIMS gradebook (see Attachment
      2).
      1.10.3.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Admin Hold for Other Reasons. The 14
      OG/CC is the approval authority for admin hold. Coordinate recommendation for admin
      hold for those students whose training has been suspended for other than medical reasons
      for more than 7 calendar days and use the AF Form 4293 for the TIMS gradebook (see
      Attachment 3).
1.11. Training Delay:
   1.11.1. Medical. A UPT student that requires extended medical treatment beyond his or her
   assigned UPT class start date will be administratively entered into training and placed into a
   duty not including flying (DNIF) status on the class start date. Adhere to timelines for
   student administrative hold and medical extensions according to AETCI 48-102, Medical
   Management of Undergraduate Flying Training Students, and AETCI 36-2205, Volume 1.
   1.11.2. PCS-to-Training Students. If a student is on administrative hold for more than 30
   calendar days, or may reach this threshold, the assigned unit will notify AETC/A3FP
   (reference paragraph 1.10.2). Suspension of the student’s aeronautical orders and (or) a CR

   may be warranted for students who spend extended time on administrative hold. Refer to the
   applicable syllabus for students returning to training.
   1.11.3. TDY-to-School Funded Students. The assigned training unit will notify
   AETC/A3FP and AETC/FMAM of any student training delays over seven calendar days and
   ensure the student’s orders are amended (reference paragraph 1.10.2). AETC/A3FP will in
   turn notify AETC/A3R.
1.12. Students in Transition Status. Commanders will assign students awaiting PCS training,
eliminees, administrative hold, etc., to duties commensurate with their background, training, and
grade. Contact AETC/A3G or AETC/A3H for the disposition of ANG and AFRC students.
1.13. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) 14 STUS/DOA flight commander assumes ADCON from
the casual officer’s DAS until 10 days prior to the start of Preflight Phase. The 14 STUS
assigned class flight commander assumes ADCON of casual students awaiting SUPT from 10
days prior to the start of the Preflight Phase and retains control until the Primary Phase track
select. Assigned class flight commanders from 14 STUS/DOM and 14 STUS/DOF assume
ADCON of students who track to the T-1 or T-38, respectively, and retain control until SUPT
graduation. Graduate student administration is held by 14 STUS/DOG.

                                           Chapter 2

                                    TRAINING FOLDER

2.1. Introduction:
   2.1.1. Each student will have a training folder. The training folder will consist of the
   electronic TIMS/GTIMS training folder and other required training documents not
   maintained in TIMS/GTIMS. If a backup version of the TIMS/GTIMS training folder is
   maintained, the unit will address procedures in local unit guidance. A student may only
   access his or her own training folder.
      2.1.1.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) The military training folder (MTF) is the paper
      copy portion of the training folder and is created by 14 STUS/DOR. The 14 STUS/DOR
      is responsible for building all SUPT student MTFs. All information must be provided to
      14 STUS/DOR NLT 5 workdays prior to each class Primary Phase start date. Offices of
      primary responsibility (OPR) are listed for products not generated by 14 STUS/DOR. 14
      STUS/DOR will provide the completed training folders to the respective gaining class
      flight commanders NLT 2 workdays prior to the Primary Phase start date (incomplete
      folders will be appropriately documented). The Primary Phase flight commander will
      ensure that the training folders are given to the Advanced Phase flight commander NLT
      the day of track select. There should also be a verbal handoff from the Primary Phase
      class flight commander and the Advanced Phase class flight commanders. In the event a
      student’s MTF is required prior to Primary Phase start (ex: Preflight Phase Commander’s
      Review), the 14 STUS/DOR will create the MTF and the assigned class flight
      commander will review/update the MTF.
   2.1.2. In addition to the training folder, the FLT/CC will maintain personal information
   folders (if required) on students to protect information of a personal nature, inappropriate for
   public access, or sensitive in nature, and thus not appropriate for the training folder. Use AF
   IMT 174, Record of Individual Counseling or AETC Form 173, Student Record of
   Academic/Nonacademic Counseling and Comments, to record counseling entries maintained
   in the personal information folder. Annotate on an AF Form 4293, Student Activity Record,
   in the student’s training folder when a counseling session is conducted.
      2.1.2.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) The personal information file (PIF) will be
      generated only if required and secured by the class flight commander.
   2.1.3. The FLT/CC will ensure training folders and personal information folders are secured
   to prevent unauthorized access.
   2.1.4. Instructors will ensure each aircraft, aircrew training device (ATD), and academic and
   ground training event is recorded in the training folder.
   2.1.5. Units will establish procedures to conduct periodic student training folder reviews to
   ensure accurate and complete documentation of each student’s training.
      2.1.5.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) At a minimum, the Preflight/Primary Phase class
      flight commander will review the MTF when he receives it from the 14 STUS/DOR, at
      the mid-course feedback, and prior to track select. The Advanced Phase class flight
AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013                                                 19


       commander will review the MTF upon initiation of Advanced Phase, at the mid-course
       feedback, and prior to graduation. Annotate accomplishment on cover sheet of MTF.
2.2. Contents. Include the following items in the training folder, as applicable.
   2.2.1. AETC Form 101, Student Performance Summary. (Note: A memorandum for record
   (MFR) maintained in TIMS/GTIMS may be substituted for the AETC Form 101.)
   2.2.2. AF Form 4293. (TIMS/GTIMS)
   2.2.3. Academic examination grades summary. (TIMS/GTIMS)
   2.2.4. Gradesheets. (TIMS/GTIMS)
       2.2.4.1. Instructors will provide postflight comments in the comment column of the
       gradesheet on individual maneuvers. Write comments in a way that provides continuity
       from one instructor pilot (IP) to the next and alerts IPs to the areas and objectives they
       should concentrate on for the ensuing sortie. As a minimum, provide comments for any
       maneuver graded below a previously required maneuver item file (MIF) proficiency level
       unless already documented on an AF Form 4293. For graduate pilot training courses,
       postflight comments are required only on items graded below MIF, if in the instructor’s
       judgment the student may have difficulty meeting MIF by the end of the unit. Ensure
       comments are consistent with assigned grades and the course training standards (CTS).
       2.2.4.2. As a minimum, under the Comments tab in TIMS/GTIMS, instructors will
       include the mission profile, overall assessment of the student’s characteristic
       performance, and any recommendations for the next IP.
       2.2.4.3. For solo formation sorties, instructors will record the name of the IP in the
       formation under the Comments tab.
       2.2.4.4. Log all student-flown landings, patterns, and approaches on each ATD and
       aircraft event. (Note: The résumé should reflect all landings, patterns, and approaches
       accomplished by the student.)
   2.2.5. CR paperwork.
   2.2.6. Messages (ANG and AFRC, if applicable).
   2.2.7. Student officer’s biography (optional).
   2.2.8. Student résumé (TIMS/GTIMS).
   2.2.9. Grade report for each category and training medium. (TIMS/GTIMS)
   2.2.10. Record of emergency procedure (EP) training. (TIMS/GTIMS)
   2.2.11. Record of special syllabus requirement accomplishment. (TIMS/GTIMS)
   2.2.12. Centrifuge Evaluation (T-38C Advanced Track). After completing centrifuge
   training, the centrifuge training facility should provide an evaluation regarding anti-G
   straining maneuver (AGSM) performance. Record the evaluation on AF Form 4293 and give
   it to the student for placement in his or her training folder.
2.3. Documentation. Accurate documentation of the student’s performance is a core
competency and integral to the student training process. Failure to do so places the integrity of
the training program at risk, fails to portray an accurate picture of the student’s actual
 20                             AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013


performance, and improperly influences class ranking. Instructors will use an AF Form 4293 (or
JSUPT-H equivalent) to document student training according to the applicable syllabus and this
instruction. Include all AF Forms 4293 in the student’s training folder. Instructors will provide
a concise summary of the student’s training and ensure entries clarify any training action. Begin
each entry with date of the event, subject or syllabus lesson numbers, overall lesson grade, and
lesson duration (if applicable). End each entry with the name, grade, and duty title of the
instructor making the entry. The student, student’s assigned IP (not applicable to JSUPT-H), and
the FLT/CC must initial all entries. If multiple entries are on a single AF Form 4293, each entry
will comply with the above guidance. Documentation is required for the following:
   2.3.1. Administrative hold.
   2.3.2. Temporary medical disqualification (DNIF status). Units may substitute a scanned or
   electronic copy of the AF IMT 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special
   Operational Duty (or DA Form 4186, Medical Recommendation for Flying Duty, for JSUPT-
   H) in the TIMS/GTIMS training folder for the AF Form 4293 entry.
   2.3.3. Failure of any academic examination, category check, flight evaluation, PC or EC.
   Note: At ENJJPT, PC is referred to as initial progress check (IPC) and EC is a final progress
   check (FPC).
   2.3.4. Counseling session.
   2.3.5. Initial IP assignment and change of assigned IP or flight (update the TIMS/GTIMS
   résumé to reflect the current assigned IP).
   2.3.6. Assignment to and removal from the commander’s awareness program (CAP).
   2.3.7. Training folder review prior to a PC, EC, or CR. The reviewing instructor will
   document any training anomalies, syllabus deviations, etc that were not previously
   documented.
   2.3.8. Incomplete lessons.
   2.3.9. SQ/CC approval to fly the initial solo for any primary student who becomes airsick
   during any of the last five sorties preceding their initial solo.
   2.3.10. Authorization to proficiency advance out of a unit and reallocation of sorties to
   another unit.
   2.3.11. Authorization for additional training (AT). The authorization authority will identify
   the reasons for an AT sortie and sign or initial the entry.
   2.3.12. Substandard performance occurring on an AT sortie.
   2.3.13. Results of the training review for students projected to exceed the syllabus maximum
   flying hour or sortie threshold.
   2.3.14. Entry into the CR process and elimination from or reinstatement into training.
   2.3.15. Syllabus deviations.
   2.3.16. Syllabus entry prerequisite waiver or syllabus waiver (required if AETC Form 6,
   Waiver Request, is not included in the electronic training folder).

  2.3.18. Unusual occurrences that could affect the student’s progress.
  2.3.19. Lessons graded overall fair (F) or unsatisfactory (U). Instructors will identify and
  document all maneuvers graded below a previously required MIF and any weak areas that
  need to be highlighted using the cause-and-effect format to document the substandard
  performance and identify the root cause. Each MIF item will be addressed separately. Do
  not use a MIF item to justify a downgrade of other MIF item(s) without a corresponding
  down grade of the first MIF item. Avoid bundling multiple MIF items under a single MIF
  item.
  2.3.20. Centrifuge Evaluation (T-38C Advanced Track).
  2.3.21. Training folder closeout statement. Include a closeout statement in every training
  folder. If the student was eliminated/withdrawn from training, state so in the statement. In

         2.3.22.1.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) When the gradebook is ready to be closed
         out (all syllabus events complete), an AF Form 4293 entry will be entered into the
         gradebook (see Attachment 4).
         2.3.22.1.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) The Primary Phase class flight commander
         should ensure that an AF Form 475 is completed for all students tracking to UH-1
         training and delivered with their MTFs to 14 STUS/DOR before they PCS.
         2.3.22.1.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) The Primary Phase flying flight commander
         will ensure that an AETC Form 240-5 and an AETC Form 1122 are completed for all
         graduating Aviation Leadership Program students and deliver the forms along with
         their training folder to 14 STUS/DOR NLT the day of graduation.
     2.3.22.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Advanced Phase closeout procedures.
         2.3.22.2.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) The flying flight commander will ensure
         that 14 STUS/DOR is notified when all the students in the class have completed
         syllabus requirements and TIMS records have been scrubbed for accuracy. The
         flying flight commander or appointed gradebook officer will enter an AF Form 4293
         closing out the gradebook, in addition for UPT advanced phase students, include the
         student’s major weapon system (MWS) assignment (see Attachment 5). The flying
         flight commander will finalize the MASS before notifying 14 STUS/DOR as soon as
         the last student has completed syllabus requirements; this is performed prior to
         graduation day. If a student is unable to complete all syllabus requirements prior to
         graduation with their class, the student will be washed back.
         2.3.22.2.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) The flying flight commander will ensure
         that an AETC Form 240-5 and an AETC Form 1122 are completed and deliver the

          aviation training jacket, grade report, resume, and the summary record of training.
2.4. Student Training Records Disposition. A student usually obtains his or her training
records during outprocessing and hand-carries them to his or her gaining unit. If the record is
incomplete when the graduate departs, the training unit will forward the training record to the
gaining unit via certified mail or E-mail within 10 duty days of the student’s graduation. The
training unit will use appropriate E-mail encryption features to properly safeguard information
sent electronically and will verify the electronic file is received. Refer to Table 2.1 for
appropriate distribution of training documents, including forms, records, and reports. Upon
completion of training or disenrollment, the training unit will maintain the student’s records

                                          Chapter 3

                                STUDENT MANAGEMENT

3.1. CAP:
   3.1.1. Objective. The objective of CAP is to focus supervisory attention on a student’s
   progress in training, specific deficiencies, and his or her potential to complete the program.
   CAP may also be used to monitor personal issues requiring supervisory attention.
   3.1.2. Categories. CAP is divided into the following categories:
      3.1.2.1. Flying. Students demonstrating flying deficiencies in an ATD or aircraft.
      3.1.2.2. Procedural. Students exhibiting substandard general or EP knowledge.
      3.1.2.3. Academic. Students exhibiting substandard academic performance.
      3.1.2.4. Airsickness. Students exhibiting airsickness.
      3.1.2.5. Military. Students exhibiting substandard military or professional behavior.
      3.1.2.6. Other. Students with personal issues requiring supervisory attention.
   3.1.3. Squadron Commander Responsibilities. During the preflight phase of UPT, the
   STUS/CC will administer the program. For graduate level courses and once a UPT student
   begins flight line training, the flying SQ/CC will administer the program. The day-to-day
   CAP administration may be delegated to the SQ/DO, squadron assistant operations officer
   (SQ/ADO), FLT/CC, flight supervisor, or designated student training manager, but the
   SQ/CC maintains overall authority and responsibility.          The STUS/CC may retain
   administrative authority of academic and military CAP during the primary and advanced
   phases of UPT if specifically authorized in local guidance. Class commanders may place
   students on military CAP if specifically authorized in local guidance. Note: For ENJJPT,
   substitute the corresponding OSS position for all STUS references in this chapter.
      3.1.3.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Primary/Advanced Phase. The 14 STUS/CC or
      designated supervisor retains the ability to place primary and advanced phase students on
      military CAP. Additionally, the 14 STUS/CC will be responsible for reporting admin
      hold and admin hold for med status. The FTS/CC will hold all other reporting
      responsibilities.   Exception: When the STUS is responsible for submitting the
      paperwork for a Primary/Advanced Phase CR as directed by the 14 OG/CC, the 14
      STUS/CC will hold reporting responsibilities.
   3.1.4. Local Guidance. Units will develop specific CAP guidance as it relates to the unit’s
   mission. As a minimum, this guidance will address criteria for different CAP categories,
   student or training activity restrictions, instructor continuity requirements, placement
   procedures, and removal procedures.
      3.1.4.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) CAP is decided based on individual
      circumstances, documented on the CAP Placement 4293 with specific restrictions and
      removal criteria.
   3.1.5. CAP Procedures. The FLT/CC, SQ/CC or MTO places the student on CAP and
   removes the student from CAP when sustained normal progress is demonstrated or when
 28                           AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013


   personal issues are resolved. The SQ/CC will be briefed prior to removing a student from
   CAP. Although CAP is intended to be a short-term program (one to two weeks), removal
   should not be strictly event based (for example, passing a category check) if the student’s
   weak areas can carry over into the next unit or category. A student requiring an extended
   period of increased supervision or repeated placement on CAP should be considered for a PC
   or EC.
       3.1.5.1. While the student is on CAP, tailor training to address the student’s particular
       situation within the limits of the syllabus. Contractor-provided training is conducted
       according to the training contract. The FLT/CC will closely monitor instructor continuity
       and ensure proficiency standards are not compromised to permit CAP students to
       progress in training.
       3.1.5.2. The immediate supervisor will counsel the student when placed on and removed
       from CAP. Initial counseling will cover CAP objectives, student training plan, instructor
       continuity, and CAP removal goals. Additional counseling is done at the discretion of the
       immediate supervisor but is required if the student fails to meet the CAP removal goals.
       The supervisor updates goals appropriately and documents all counseling in the student’s
       training folder.
       3.1.5.3. The student’s immediate supervisor will brief squadron leadership weekly on the
       student’s progress. As a minimum, this briefing will include the student’s strong and
       weak areas, AT details, potential to graduate, and anticipated removal date from CAP.
3.2. Progress Checks and Elimination Checks. PCs/ECs are full mission-profile sorties
during which a student’s performance is observed, rated potential is evaluated, and ability to
complete the course within syllabus constraints is considered. Conduct PCs/ECs according to
the applicable syllabus. PCs/ECs are separate from the normal syllabus flow. Students must
demonstrate proficiency on the PC/EC to the current stage of training. PCs/ECs are key events
in the CR process. Triggers for these events are defined in the applicable syllabus.
   3.2.1. Authorized PC/EC pilots. Only duly appointed and qualified instructor pilots will
   administer a PC/EC. Refer to the applicable syllabus for authorized PC/EC pilots. Normally
   do not fly the student with the same PC/EC pilot on consecutive and/or subsequent PC/EC
   sorties.
   3.2.2. Ground Evaluation. PC/EC ground evaluations may be conducted as a result of a
   failed category check/PC/EC for unsatisfactory general knowledge, ground operations,
   mission planning or EPs, or as the result of a FLT/CC-directed evaluation for failure to
   progress or meet syllabus standards in procedural knowledge. (These evaluations may
   include a simulator mission.)
       3.2.2.1. The designated PC/EC instructor will conduct the entire briefing, ground
       evaluation execution, debriefing, and assign the overall grade.
       3.2.2.2. The ground evaluation should be one to two hours in length and of sufficient
       breadth and depth to evaluate the student’s overall procedural knowledge.
   3.2.3. Simulator:
AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013                                                  29


      3.2.3.1. During PCs/ECs, civilian simulator instructors (CSI) will serve only as console
      operators. Their participation is limited to assisting the PC/EC instructor with operating
      the simulator to facilitate mission execution.
      3.2.3.2. The PC/EC instructor will brief the assigned CSI separately on mission
      objectives, mission profile, event flow, desired scenarios, and areas of student weakness.
      The actual student mission briefing, execution, debriefing, assignment of individual
      grades, and assessment of overall student performance is the sole responsibility of the
      designated PC/EC instructor.
      3.2.3.3. The PC/EC instructor will not substitute a simulator PC/EC for a syllabus-
      directed aircraft sortie.
      3.2.3.4. Simulators provide valuable training to prepare students for actual aircraft
      missions; however, consider a student for an aircraft PC when he or she is identified by
      repeated failures or lack of progress in an instrument simulator. If a student progresses to
      an EC in an instrument simulator unit, the EC should be accomplished in the aircraft
      (other than general knowledge or procedural issues best handled by an EC ground
      evaluation or emergency procedure simulator). A student should not be eliminated in an
      instrument simulator training unit if he or she has not flown an instrument aircraft sortie.
   3.2.4. Grading. Grade PCs/ECs according to syllabus guidance.
   3.2.5. Incomplete PC/EC. The PC/EC pilot determines if the sortie is complete. A PC/EC
   is “Incomplete” only if the mission tasks and objectives could not be completed to ascertain a
   reasonable evaluation of student performance.
   3.2.6. Continuation Training (CT) Meetings. The SQ/CC or designated PC/EC pilot will
   conduct PC/EC pilot CT meetings at least quarterly to ensure command and squadron PC/EC
   philosophy is implemented and standardized. As a minimum, each meeting should include a
   review of pass and fail rates by individual PC/EC instructors over the last quarter and year-
   to-date, quarterly and annual PC/EC pass and fail rates by category, and at least one grading
   scenario brought to a conclusion and documented in the meeting minutes. Grading scenarios
   should generate thoughtful discussion and reference to the individual CTS appropriate for the
   scenario. Document the meetings in enough detail to allow those who were unable to attend
   to read, initial the meeting minutes, and understand what transpired.
3.3. Commander’s Review Process:
   3.3.1. Overview. The CR recommends the student’s elimination or retention in training.
   All students in a formal flying training course will go through a CR before being eliminated
   or removed from training. Complete the CR process within 10 duty days (24 duty days for
   international students) from the date the initiating authority (IA) signs the AETC Form 139,
   Record of Commander’s Review Action (Undergraduate Pilot Training) or AETC Form 140,
   Record of Commander’s Review Action (Graduate Pilot Training) as appropriate.
   Exception: ENJJPT uses a training review board, as required, to manage students not
   meeting normal syllabus progress. (Refer to the appropriate ENJJPT syllabuses for specific
   guidelines.)
   3.3.2. Entry. The IA will enter the student in the CR process NLT three duty days after
   meeting the syllabus trigger. Remove the student from training pending final approving
 30                           AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013


   authority (AA) decision. The IA may elect to continue the student in academic training with
   reviewing authority (RA) concurrence. Instruct UPT students not to attend flight line
   activities (aircraft or simulator) until reinstated. Students projected to exceed the syllabus
   maximum sortie or flying hour threshold because of overall poor performance should be
   considered for a CR. If the syllabus does not identify a maximum threshold, use 115 percent
   as a guide. UPT students failing three category checks or a combination of four category
   checks, PCs and (or) ECs during the same phase of training should be considered for a CR.
   3.3.3. IA. During the preflight phase, the STUS/CC is the IA. During the primary and
   advanced phases, the SQ/CC conducting the student’s syllabus training is the IA. For
   graduate courses, the SQ/CC conducting the student’s syllabus training is the IA. The IA
   will:
      3.3.3.1. Notify the student in writing of his or her consideration for elimination and brief
      the student on the CR process (Figure 3.1). For international students, also notify the
      local base IMSO. For ANG and AFRC students, refer to paragraph 1.7.1.1.
      3.3.3.2. Complete the IA portion of the Commander’s Review Checklist and Briefing
      Guide (Figure 3.2).
   3.3.4. RA. The OG/CC is the RA. The RA will:
      3.3.4.1. Review the student’s training and recommend elimination from or retention in
      training. The OG/CC may delegate this authority to the deputy operations group
      commander (OG/CD), operations support SQ/CC, or any flying training SQ/CC (not to
      include the student’s SQ/CC). The RA will examine the student’s training records and,
      as deemed necessary, interview the student and FLT/CC or SQ/CC.
      3.3.4.2. Complete the RA portion of the CR Checklist (Figure 3.2).
      3.3.4.3. Suspend the CR if it becomes apparent that circumstances require convening an
      investigation under the provisions of AFI 51-602 or when information arises that would
      cause the student to be medically disqualified. Reconvene as appropriate to complete the
      CR process.
   3.3.5. AA. The WG/CC is the AA. The AA will:
      3.3.5.1. Complete the AA portion of the CR Checklist (Figure 3.2).
      3.3.5.2. List any authorized AT on AETC Form 139 or AETC Form 140, as applicable.

     1.10. Notify the base IMSO for international students.
2. The Reviewing Authority (RA):
   2.1. Review the student’s training and recommend elimination from or retention in
   training.
   2.2. Complete Section III of AETC Form 139 or AETC Form 140, as applicable, and
   forward the form with all applicable records to the AA for final decision. Include a
   written summary of significant facts and specific rationale used to arrive at the
   recommendations.
   2.3. Inform the student of the sequence of events for CR.
   2.4. Inform the student of individual rights for legal assistance and representation if
   convened under AFI 51-602, Boards of Officers.
3. The Approving Authority (AA):
   3.1. Review the student’s records and RA’s recommendations.
   3.2. Decide whether the student is retained in or eliminated from training.
   3.3. Complete Section IV of AETC Form 139 or AETC Form 140, as applicable. Include
   remarks on the student’s officership and, in the event of elimination, recommend a follow-
   on career field. For UPT medical eliminees, provide a statement in Section IV of AETC
   Form 139 evaluating the student’s ability to complete training if medically requalified.
   3.4. Inform the student, upon elimination, of the opportunity to indicate personal desires
   for retention in service and future training according to AFI 36-2110, Assignments.
   Explain the possibility of reassignment action or release from extended active duty under

       3.3.5.3. Not recommend UPT eliminees (or potential eliminees, if training with the
       Navy) for entry into any other JSUPT or ENJJPT training. Because of academic
       similarities, do not recommend JSUPT and ENJJPT eliminees for combat systems officer
AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013                                                   33


      (CSO), remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) or air battle management (ABM) training unless
      they have a minimum academic average of 93 percent. Additionally, the AA will not
      recommend students eliminated for manifestation of apprehension (MOA) or drop on
      request (DOR) for any other flying training. AA may recommend UPT eliminees for
      undergraduate RPA training (URT) provided they still meet required medical standards.
      The AA should consider the student’s motivation, situational awareness, task
      management skills, and airmanship when making URT recommendations. Note: UPT
      students with aeronautical rating cannot DOR and fall under the procedures in AFI 11-
      402.
   3.3.6. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) The 14 STUS/DOA is responsible for submitting the
   paperwork for all CR packages prior to 10 days before Preflight Phase. The class flight
   commander is responsible for all CR packages in Preflight Phase and non-flying-related CRs
   (DORs, failure to adapt, and medical disqualifications, etc.) throughout SUPT. The
   respective flying flight commander is responsible for submitting the paperwork for all other
   CR packages in the Primary and Advanced Phases unless directed by the 14 OG/CC on a
   case-by-case basis.
3.3. (COLUMBUSAFB) Commander’s Review (CR) Process: The class flight commander
retains ADCON throughout the CR process and will dictate duty location. Ensure current CR
checklist/paperwork template maintained by 14 STUS/DOR is used. (Note: Individual
squadrons may modify templates with names and office symbols that match their squadron;
however, standard formatting should remain.) The CR timeline shall be followed (see
Attachment 6).
3.4. Student Eliminations:
   3.4.1. Students should be eliminated if they:
      3.4.1.1. Exhibit lack of adaptability (LOA), which is the inability to complete the course
      because of physical, psychological, or personality factors. LOA eliminees require an
      evaluation from both medical and rated personnel. This category includes airsickness,
      GLOC, and MOA. Medical and rated personnel conducting the evaluations will
      document the results in the student’s training folder. They will specify the physical,
      psychological, or personality factors that led to the LOA determination. In addition, they
      will annotate specific deficiencies in Section IV of AETC Form 139 or AETC Form 140.
      3.4.1.2. Fail to meet proficiency standards of the syllabus in flying, academics, or
      procedures.
      3.4.1.3. Fail to demonstrate the potential to complete the course within syllabus
      constraints.
      3.4.1.4. Receive punitive action under the articles of the UCMJ.
      3.4.1.5. Fail to meet fitness standards prescribed in AFI 36-2905 and this publication.
   3.4.2. Students will be eliminated if they:
      3.4.2.1. DOR (UPT only). The FLT/CC will counsel the student on the ramifications of
      DOR (i.e., permanent disqualification from flying status and possible reclassification
      proceeding) prior to entering him or her into a CR. Once the student is counseled and
 34                            AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013


       signs the AETC Form 139, he or she is ineligible for reinstatement. Note: UPT students
       with aeronautical rating cannot DOR and fall under the procedures in AFI 11-402.
       3.4.2.2. Become medically disqualified, unless a flight surgeon determines the
       disqualification may resolve within 12 months of the initial disqualification. In the latter
       instance, place the student in administrative hold status. Refer to AFI 48-123, AETCI
       48-102, and Chapter 4 of this publication for additional guidance. Note: For those
       students funded under the TDY-to-school program, the assigned unit will notify
       AETC/A3FP and AETC/FMAM as soon as the administrative hold status becomes
       probable.
       3.4.2.3. Initiate action to separate from the service.
       3.4.2.4. Get recalled by the parent unit, higher headquarters, or home country. Note:
       Units will not allow students to be recalled without prior coordination with AETC/A3F.
       3.4.2.5. Get involved in drug abuse substantiated by reliable evidence.
       3.4.2.6. Get adjudicated absent without leave, are confined, or have deserted.
       3.4.2.7. Become hospitalized for an extended period (as determined by the WG/CC).
       Student may be considered for reinstatement at a later date.
       3.4.2.8. Demonstrate improper attitude or lack of responsibility toward assigned duties or
       obligations. This may include character disorders that raise doubt about the student’s
       fitness for training.
       3.4.2.9. Fail two ECs in the same phase or fail three ECs total (applies only to UPT).
       AETC/A2/3/10 is waiver authority for this requirement.
   3.4.3. AETC/A2/3/10 will monitor elimination of female and minority students from flying
   training. AETC/A3R will collect UPT female and minority elimination data. The data is
   generated from information each flying unit provides as part of the AETC Decision Support
   System.
3.5. Student Dispositions:
   3.5.1. Students reinstated into training after a CR will complete a PC or EC (as appropriate)
   following completion of any AT authorized by the AA in Section IV of AETC Form 139 or
   AETC Form 140. Students reinstated after academic deficiencies must repeat the
   examination after appropriate AT. Students reinstated following a flight evaluation board
   will complete AT directed by the final approval authority.
   3.5.2. After completing AETC Form 139 or AETC Form 140, Section IV, units will process
   eliminated students under AFI 36-3206, AFI 36-3207; AFI 36-2110, or the ETCA.
   Additionally, units will process international students according to AFI 16-105; rated pilots
   and UPT students with an aeronautical rating according to AFI 11-402; and pipeline or PCS
   students through appropriate personnel channels.
3.6. CR Records Distribution:
   3.6.1. The school registrar or similarly designated authority will maintain original CR
   records according to the RDS and distribute them within 10 duty days of CR completion.
   These records must be available for review.
AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013                                               35


      3.6.2. Units will distribute eliminated officers’ CR records as outlined in Table 3.1 and
      maintain them according to the RDS.
      3.6.3. The course registrar will ensure each elimination case is updated in the training
      management database with an elimination code.
      3.6.4. The servicing flight management office will update ARMS with the appropriate
      disqualification code.

                                            Chapter 4

                      MEDICAL MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS

4.1. General. This chapter establishes student management requirements for appropriate
medical and operations personnel. Operations and medical personnel must ensure commanders
are informed when students exhibit MOA symptoms or other medical conditions that affect daily
student training decisions. Supervisors must also strive to keep students motivated and flying on
a regular basis.
4.2. Airsickness Procedures for UPT Students:
   4.2.1. Students must meet MIF standards to continue flight training. Early in the primary
   phase of UPT, the instructor may help students overcome the impacts of airsickness by
   changing the profile, momentarily taking control of the aircraft, or if necessary, terminating
   the mission when airsickness symptoms persist. Use sortie termination as a last resort since
   continued exposure to the flight environment enhances physiological adaptation. As students
   progress in training, instructor assistance decreases. During the last five sorties preceding
   initial solo in the primary phase, instructors may offer only minimal assistance.
   4.2.2. FLT/CCs and instructors will send students who experience active or passive
   airsickness to the flight surgeon for examination, counseling, and treatment as soon as
   practical and before the next aircraft or simulator sortie. Document all episodes of
   airsickness on AF Form 4293.
   4.2.3. While participating in the airsickness management program (AMP), students will
   continue the normal syllabus flow to include flying. AMP is outlined in AFI 48-123 and
   AETCI 48-102.
   4.2.4. The FLT/CC will place primary phase students who become airsick on four or more
   presolo sorties on CAP.
   4.2.5. During any of the last five sorties preceding the initial solo or on any post solo sortie,
   instructors will grade primary phase students as unsatisfactory overall when they develop
   airsickness resulting in (1) IP intervention, (2) relinquishing aircraft control, or (3) premature
   sortie termination. In addition, students who become airsick during any of the last five
   sorties preceding the initial solo must receive SQ/CC approval before flying an initial solo or
   be entered into the CR process. Document SQ/CC approval on an AF Form 4293.
   4.2.6. Instructors will grade advanced phase students who occupy any pilot or copilot
   position and develop airsickness on any sortie as unsatisfactory overall. Students who
   experience airsickness while not occupying a pilot seat with access to flight controls (jump
   seat, passenger seat, etc.) may not necessarily warrant an overall grade of unsatisfactory. In
   this case, consider the inflight conditions, training accomplished, and whether or not the
   mission is terminated early to determine the final grade.
   4.2.7. Limit student pharmacological therapy to a maximum of three sorties. Treatment
   must stop no later than five sorties prior to the initial solo. Medication is restricted to
   students flying in the pre-solo phase of primary training.
   4.2.8. Following any airsickness episode, the student’s next flight must be with an IP.
 38                            AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013


   4.2.9. After the third post-solo airsickness and every third episode thereafter, the SQ/CC will
   assess the student’s potential to complete training. If the student’s potential to graduate is
   high, the SQ/CC will make an entry on the AF Form 4293 to continue the student in training.
   If the student’s potential to graduate is low, the CR process will determine whether the
   student is retained in or eliminated from training. Conduct student eliminations according to
   AETCI 48-102.
   4.2.10. Commanders will process rated officers in UPT who cannot overcome airsickness
   problems according to AFI 48-123. Squadron supervisors should coordinate closely with the
   chief of aeromedical services (or Army equivalent for helicopter training) for each of these
   special cases.
4.3. Airsickness Procedures for Graduate Pilot Training Students:
   4.3.1. A student who experiences airsickness while not occupying a pilot seat with access to
   flight controls (jump seat, passenger seat, etc.) may not necessarily warrant an overall grade
   of unsatisfactory. In this case, instructors should consider the inflight conditions, training
   accomplished, and whether or not the mission is terminated early to determine the final
   grade. They will use the applicable syllabus to grade students who occupy any pilot or
   copilot position and develop airsickness.
   4.3.2. Students must meet MIF standards to continue flight training.
   4.3.3. FLT/CCs and instructors will send students who experience active or passive
   airsickness to the flight surgeon for examination, counseling, and treatment as soon as
   practical and before the next aircraft or simulator sortie. Document all episodes of
   airsickness on AF Form 4293.
   4.3.4. While participating in AMP, students continue the normal syllabus flow to include
   flying. Limit student pharmacological therapy to a maximum of three sorties.
   4.3.5. Commanders will process rated officers who cannot overcome airsickness problems
   according to AFI 48-123 and AFI 11-402. Squadron supervisors should coordinate closely
   with the chief of aeromedical services for each of these special cases.
4.4. Inflight G-Tolerance Problems. Reference AETCI 36-2205, Volume 1.
4.5. Centrifuge Training. Conduct centrifuge training according to AFI 11-404, Centrifuge
Training for High-G Aircrew. A qualified aerospace physiologist will document completion of
training on AF IMT 702, Individual Physiological Training Record. Document training as
“Initial Centrifuge”. In addition to AFI 11-404, the following policy applies to U.S. students at
T-38C JSUPT and ENJJPT training locations and international JSUPT students who continue in
the training pipeline (for example, IFF or PIT).
   4.5.1. If a student fails any of the first three centrifuge profiles on his or her first attempt,
   commanders will:
       4.5.1.1. Place the student on administrative hold and notify AETC/A3FP (reference
       paragraph 1.10.2).
       4.5.1.2. Ensure the student receives a medical evaluation as soon as practical after the
       failure.
AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013                                            39


     4.5.1.3. Review student centrifuge tapes for AGSM techniques and administer another
     fighter aircrew conditioning test. Develop a training program as appropriate to work on
     AGSM technique and strength conditioning.
     4.5.1.4. Reassess the student within 60 to 180 calendar days according to AFI 11-404.
     Try to schedule the second attempt as close as practical to the 60-day threshold to
     minimize the time on administrative hold. If the student passes the second attempt,
     remove from administrative hold and resume training according to the “Unusual
     Extended Break in Training” syllabus guidance.
  4.5.2. A student failing the second attempt will remain on administrative hold. Notify
  AETC/A3FP and AETC/A3R. AETC/A3R will coordinate follow-on actions with AETC/A1
  and AFPC staffs.

                                            Chapter 5

                                    STUDENT TRAINING

5.1. Flight Commander Responsibilities. The FLT/CC is the first echelon of command
responsible for safely and efficiently scheduling people, mission and aircraft. The FLT/CC must
know the capabilities and experience levels of all flight members and ensure they fly the right
mission at the right time according to applicable syllabuses and directives. Safety must remain
paramount in the FLT/CC’s mind. FLT/CCs will keep the operations supervisors informed of
the training plan and any changes and will:
   5.1.1. Supervise and monitor student training.
   5.1.2. Assist students and supervisors with the training review process and provide for
   discipline, physical and mental well-being, and general welfare of students. The FLT/CC
   must be aware of each student’s progress in all areas, including the potential effect of
   external factors (personal problems, etc.). FLT/CCs help students when they:
       5.1.2.1. Counsel students determined to be marginal performers or those placed on CAP
       and conduct follow-up counseling as often thereafter as necessary.
       5.1.2.2. Counsel students, as necessary, on appropriate management issues, including
       personal problems and disciplinary matters. If additional assistance is necessary, refer
       students to the appropriate base support agencies (Chaplain, Legal Office, etc.).
   5.1.3. Maintain student training folders according to Chapter 2 of this instruction, local
   guidance, and the applicable syllabus.
   5.1.4. Ensure student compliance and documentation of PT accomplishments.
   5.1.5. Coordinate with academic supervisors on individual student performance.
   5.1.6. Ensure students are briefed on assignment opportunities as applicable.
   5.1.7. Brief student leaders on the scope and limits of their responsibilities.
   5.1.8. Assist in syllabus-directed functions.
5.2. Syllabus Resource Management. The FLT/CC and SQ/CC are responsible for the
management of student flight hours. Each syllabus unit has an associated number of sorties or
missions and flight hours. On average, the syllabus mission and any AT, PC, or EC sorties
should reflect the average mission duration (AMD) for the unit of training. IPs should closely
adhere to the syllabus AMD. The AMD should not be exceeded except for extenuating
circumstances or to meet training objectives.
5.3. Additional Training Sorties. AT sorties provide extra training to students in specific
circumstances, to include category check failure, break-in-training, CR reinstatement, syllabus
waiver, OG/CC corrective actions, or as otherwise specifically authorized by the syllabus. Refer
to the applicable syllabus for authorized AT sorties and specific guidelines.
   5.3.1. Adaptation to Corrective Lenses (Coded XXX84). These sorties are authorized for
   students who experience training difficulties and require corrective lenses. Normally, these
   sorties are flown in the current unit; however, they may be flown in a different category if
   required. The next aircraft syllabus sortie flown after these sorties must be dual.
AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013                                                  41


   5.3.2. Reallocation (Coded XXX85). A syllabus may authorize sorties designated for one
   unit to be flown in another unit. The reallocated sortie is designated as an “XXX85” in the
   appropriate category. Sorties will be flown prior to the appropriate end-of-unit lesson.
   5.3.3. Warm-up/Break-in-Training (Coded XXX86). These sorties are authorized for delays
   in training and will be flown only when remaining syllabus sorties are insufficient to
   compensate for the student’s break in training. Instructors should consider using the
   simulator instead of the aircraft if appropriate for the student’s category.
   5.3.4. Reinstatement by CR (Coded XXX87). These sorties may be authorized for students
   reinstated into training after a CR.
   5.3.5. International (Coded XXX87). These sorties are authorized as outlined in the
   individual syllabus for international students who may not be able to meet MIF standards
   because of such factors as language or cultural differences. Obtain advance authorization for
   additional flying hours according to guidance in the individual syllabus and this instruction.
   5.3.6. Total Sortie/Flying Time (Coded XXX87). Students will fly these sorties to meet
   minimum syllabus sorties or flying time requirements. These sorties are normally full
   mission profile and are authorized when it becomes apparent they are needed. When
   possible, schedule them prior to checks to enhance student proficiency.
   5.3.7. Prior to PC and EC (Coded XXX87). These sorties may be authorized before a PC
   and EC. These sorties are not automatically given to every student. They are reserved for
   cases where the SQ/CC determines some training irregularity or anomaly has occurred, and
   the student has demonstrated the potential to complete the syllabus. Document the training
   irregularity or anomaly as part of the AF Form 4293 AT authorization entry.
   5.3.8. Q-2/Q-3 Flight Evaluation (Coded XXX87). The flight evaluator may authorize these
   sorties as a result of a Q-2/Q-3 flight evaluation.
5.4. Ground Training Units (GTU):
   5.4.1. GTUs are instructional lessons that are normally prerequisites for simulator or aircraft
   missions and complement academic instruction.
   5.4.2. Instructors are responsible for teaching GTUs according to instructor guides.
   Instructors may teach the GTUs to students on an individual or group basis.
   5.4.3. Syllabus time for GTUs is an approximate time to complete the lesson. Log the
   completion time, date, and actual training time in TIMS/GTIMS.
5.5. Formal Flight Briefings:
   5.5.1. T-6A and T-38C JSUPT flights will conduct daily formal flight briefings before the
   first scheduled flying period. The briefing will cover current and forecast weather,
   operations notes, flying safety, and (or) a standardization briefing (paragraph 5.8). Unless
   excused by the FLT/CC, students and assigned instructors must attend the formal flight
   briefing; attached instructors are highly encouraged to attend.
   5.5.2. T-1A JSUPT flights will conduct a formal flight briefing at least once a week. This
   briefing may occur any time during the duty day and will cover appropriate administrative
   information, flight safety (weekly), ground safety (at least monthly), standardization briefing
   (paragraph 5.8), and a cockpit/crew resource management (CRM) topic (at least every other
 42                            AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013


   week according to paragraph 5.9). Brief operations notes, weather, and notices to airmen in
   individual crew briefings. On the days a group flight briefing is not accomplished, IPs will
   cover required information during individual crew briefings.
   5.5.3. JSUPT-H will conduct mass aircrew briefings prior to each flying period. The mass
   aircrew briefing will integrate required briefing in paragraphs 5.7, 5.8 and 5.9.
5.6. Night Briefings. Instructors and students scheduled to fly local UPT night sorties will
attend a formal night briefing prior to their first flight of each week’s night operations. This
briefing will cover departure and arrival procedures, spatial disorientation, visual illusions, and
terrain avoidance to include minimum safe altitudes. If essential duties prevent instructors or
students from attending the night briefing, a squadron supervisor will brief them before night
flying. For JSUPT, conduct a formal night briefing for T-6A and T-1A students and instructors
before the beginning of the student’s first night sortie. In JSUPT-H for the H-1 night phase,
academics and standup briefings fulfill this requirement.
5.7. Flying Safety Briefings. JSUPT flights will conduct these briefings at least once a normal
workweek. Briefings should emphasize aircraft mishap prevention and promote group
discussion to improve student judgment and confidence.
5.8. Standardization Briefings. Emphasize situational EPs to include overhead questioning
and group discussions of selected topics. Briefings should be structured to assist in the
development of judgment, proper application of procedures, and realistic use of available
publications. The standardization briefing should include a standup EP situation.
   5.8.1. T-6A, T-38C, and TH1H JSUPT flights will conduct standardization briefings at least
   three times during a normal workweek. The standardization briefings may be in conjunction
   with formal flight briefing or at a time that ensures maximum IP and student participation.
   T-6A flights will conduct these briefings throughout the program. The FLT/CC may use his
   or her discretion whether or not to accomplish standardization briefings for T-38C flights as
   these briefings are optional when the class is within 30 calendar days of graduation. T-1A
   flights will conduct these briefings until the first student in the class has completed the
   transition category check.
   5.8.2. If time does not permit, T-1A flights are not required to accomplish a standup EP
   during the formal flight briefing. However, in addition to the weekly standardization
   briefing, T-1A flights will conduct standup EPs at least three times a week until each student
   has successfully accomplished a standup situation as both pilot and copilot.
5.9. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Briefings. AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource
Management Training Program, and its AETC Supplement outline requirements for the CRM
training program. CRM briefings will address human-factor causes in aircraft mishaps. Use
real-world mishaps as examples in the briefings. Conduct the briefings at least once every other
week. Brief and debrief CRM core concepts and skills on every aircraft and simulator mission.
CRM briefings may be substituted for safety or standardization briefings, but they are not
testable.
5.10. Mission Briefings. These briefings set the tone of the lesson. Cover specific objectives,
mission accomplishment, and specific flight or simulator restrictions. Discuss techniques and
procedures for flying the mission before or after the mission briefing. An instructor will brief
undergraduate students prior to all solo flights. IPs having continuity with the student should
AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013                                                      43


accomplish this briefing. Document the briefing on an AETC Form 39, Solo Briefing, or a
locally approved substitute. Completing this form is self-explanatory. Post-mission briefings
measure the success in accomplishing the mission objectives. Refer to the appropriate AFI 11-
series publication for briefing formats. The applicable syllabus contains mission briefing
requirements.
5.11. Student Standardization Program. The standardization program consists of briefings
and tests to ensure students maintain the highest proficiency level in procedural knowledge and
application. All UPT flights will administer a weekly EP quiz (EPQ) covering general and EP
knowledge appropriate for the student’s stage of training. Students are required to take the EPQ
until they complete the last aircraft sortie for their phase of training. The minimum passing score
on all flight line tests is 85 percent and 100 percent for Boldface tests. If an international student
fails a written test, the instructor will determine if English comprehension is a significant
contributing factor. If so, the instructor may give the student an oral retest. Except for T-1A
flights, the EPQ may substitute for a standardization briefing. For JSUPT-H, the EPQ is the
“flight line quiz.” Refer to the applicable syllabus for additional guidance.
   5.11.1. The EPQ may be administered in printed or electronic format. Printed EPQs will be
   numbered sequentially for accounting purposes. Immediately prior to administering the
   EPQ, the unit stan/eval member or testing administrator will:
       5.11.1.1. Generate a fresh 20-question EPQ from the Patriot Excalibur/TIMS (Logic
       Extension Resources/GTIMS for JSUPT-H) secure server with a representative number
       of questions from each assigned reading area.
       5.11.1.2. Secure the room and administer the EPQ.
       5.11.1.3. Collect any printed EPQs and answer sheets and account for each numbered
       copy.
       5.11.1.4. Grade the EPQ; record the scores; and destroy all test copies, answer sheets, the
       answer key, transparencies, and (or) electronic versions.
   5.11.2. The following documents are available to supplement the standardization program:
       5.11.2.1. AETC Form 41, T-38C Emergency Procedures. This form contains a list of
       EPs to cover during a T-38C course. Completing this form is self-explanatory. In the
       blank space next to the specific EP, enter the date the EP situation was covered.
       5.11.2.2. AETC Form 46, T-6A Emergency Procedures. This form contains a list of EPs
       to cover during a T-6A course. Completing this form is self-explanatory. In the blank
       space next to the specific EP, enter the date the EP situation was covered.
       5.11.2.3. AETC Form 100A, T-1A Emergency Procedures. This form contains a list of
       EPs to cover during a T-1A course. Completing this form is self-explanatory. In the
       blank space next to the specific EP, enter the date the EP situation was covered.
       5.11.2.4. Boldface emergency procedures and operating limitations worksheets are
       available       on      the     AETC/A3V      website       at     https://www-
       r.aetc.af.mil/do/dof/download.asp.
5.12. Incomplete Sorties:
 44                            AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013


   5.12.1. Except for category checks, PCs, and ECs, the FLT/CC will determine if a sortie is
   incomplete. He or she will:
       5.12.1.1. Evaluate each situation on an individual basis. (Note: If a student has had
       ample opportunity to learn a task and subsequently flies a short sortie, do not incomplete
       the sortie. Also do not incomplete a lesson solely because an individual maneuver is
       omitted when the omitted maneuver can be accomplished on a later sortie without
       degrading accomplishment of future training objectives.)
       5.12.1.2. Consider the sortie’s effect on the quality of the student’s training and each
       student’s prior training opportunities as well as the remaining sorties available to
       accomplish training objectives. The syllabus provides a means of AT for students who
       do not progress to the end of unit MIF proficiency requirements.
       5.12.1.3. Ensure both above- and below-average students are afforded the same training
       opportunities to refine their skills.
       5.12.1.4. Normally do not incomplete a solo sortie.
   5.12.2. Incomplete sorties do not break a string of unsatisfactory syllabus sorties.
5.13. Grading Procedures. Instructors will grade student training according to the applicable
syllabus. The CTS is the baseline for all maneuver grading. Instructors must compare student
performance to the CTS before assigning maneuver grades.
5.14. Category Checks. Category checks validate students have achieved the required
proficiency and (or) instructional level for a category, are conducted according to the applicable
syllabus, and are graded against the CTS using the required MIF proficiency and instructional
levels as the baseline.
   5.14.1. Profile. The check FLT/CC (SQ/CC for JSUPT-H) will ensure a cross-section of
   maneuvers optioned in the category check MIF are sampled regularly on category checks.
   5.14.2. Grading. Checks are syllabus events and the CTS must be applied exactly as on
   daily events. The starting point for assigning any maneuver grade is the CTS which equates
   to satisfactory proficiency level or a letter grade of G. The instructor will grade student
   maneuvers according to the applicable syllabus, grading completed checks excellent (E),
   good (G), U or NG (no grade) overall.
   5.14.3. Incomplete Checks. With check FLT/CC (SQ/CC for JSUPT-H) approval, checks
   may be considered incomplete if no maneuver completed by the student was graded below
   MIF and either all required maneuvers were not flown or the number of maneuvers flown
   was insufficient to reasonably assess the student’s overall performance. If a check is
   incomplete, the student need only perform those maneuvers necessary to complete a normal
   check profile on the subsequent (refly) check.
   5.14.4. Failed Areas. If a student fails a category check in an area directly related to
   another category, the subsequent PC or EC may be flown in the related category. For
   example, if a student received a grade of U on landings during a navigation category check, a
   PC may be flown in the contact or transition category if in the IP’s judgment the training
   category did not affect the maneuver grade.
AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013                                                45


5.15. Check Flight CT Meetings. The check FLT/CC will conduct check flight CT meetings at
least quarterly to ensure grading philosophy, practices and standards are consistent and
standardized. All individuals who conduct category checks are required to attend. As a
minimum, each meeting should include a review of pass and fail rates by category for each check
administered since the last CT meeting, category check weak areas or trends, pass and fail rates
of individual check pilots, and at least one grading scenario brought to a conclusion. Document
the meetings in enough detail so that those who have an authorized absence can read the meeting
minutes and understand what transpired. For JSUPT-H, the SQ/CC will conduct the CT meeting
with all squadron check pilots.
5.16. Flight Evaluations. Conduct flight evaluations according to AFI 11-202, Volume
2/AETC Supplement, AFI 11-2MDS-specific volumes 2, and the applicable syllabus.
5.17. Wash Back. When a student washes back into another class, the SQ/CC is the approving
authority for determining the appropriate TIMS/GTIMS version of the syllabus to use to
continue the student’s training.
   5.17.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Preflight Phase. The 14 STUS student section is the
   IA and determines when any holdover or wash back actions are necessary.
   5.17.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Primary and Advanced Phases. The flying training
   squadron is the IA for academic or flying training issues and determines when holdover or
   wash back actions are necessary. The 14 STUS student section is the IA for administrative
   reasons (i.e. disciplinary, personal, etc.) and STUS/CC in coordination with FTS/CC
   determines when holdover or wash back actions are necessary. However, the 14 STUS must
   coordinate with both the FTS/CC and Flight commanders before taking any holdover or wash
   back action.
5.18. Civilian Flight Training. To maintain the integrity of the AETC training system,
students rated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) (private pilot, commercial pilot,
etc.) may fly civilian aircraft once they enter into UPT, but they may not pursue additional
ratings or qualifications. Students not rated by the FAA will not fly civilian aircraft after
entering into UPT. Prior to conducting any civilian flying, students will complete an AETC
Form 410, High-Risk Activities Worksheet, and submit the form for commander approval.
5.19. Flight Planning Software use in UPT. Flight instruction of flight planning principles in
UPT is focused on the understanding of the key concepts involved in flight planning and
application those concepts through the use of flight planning software.
   5.19.1. In the primary phase, the objectives focus on the skills to produce computer
   generated flight planning products. Strong emphasis is placed on manual flight planning
   skills to validate computer-generated products. Primary students will only use approved
   flight planning software for syllabus-directed events.
   5.19.2. In the advanced phase, reinforce the flight planning skills and conceptual
   understanding learned in the primary phase. Students are required to plan and fly applicable
   sorties using software-based flight planning methods according to syllabus requirements.
5.20. Vision Restricting Device (VRD). All T-6A student pilots will use the AETC standard
VRD for instrument training as directed by the appropriate syllabus. IPs will ensure student
 46                           AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013


pilots properly stow the VRD prior to engine start and after landing prior to opening the canopy.
Local unit fabrication shops will supply the VRDs as required.
5.21. Computer Assisted Instruction (CAI). For UPT only, if CAI is not operating,
reschedule the lessons to maximize the use of CAI. The OG/CC-appointed TIMS/GTIMS
manager (TM) may approve classroom presentation of CAI lessons on a one-time basis.
Instructors must know their subject well enough to instruct CAI lessons, but need not prepare
formal lesson plans. Note: The TM must notify AETC/A3IS in writing within five duty days
after teaching CAI lessons in the classroom. The notification must include the date of
occurrence, student class or section, course hours, and reason for classroom instruction.
Repeated use of classroom presentations instead of CAI lessons requires an approved waiver
from AETC/A3F.

                                            Chapter 6

                   UNDERGRADUATE INTERNATIONAL TRAINING

6.1. International Military Student (IMS) Training. IMSs receive Air Force formal course
training under the International Military Education and Training (IMET) Program, a foreign
military sales (FMS) case, a counter-drug program, or as part of a presidential draw down
initiative. These activities are part of the DoD SATP. The administration of SATP students
generally adheres to the procedures outlined in the preceding chapters, but there are certain
exceptions. This chapter addresses only those areas where SATP student administration differs
from Air Force student administration. Follow the procedures outlined in Chapters 1 through 5
for any area not covered in this chapter.
6.2. International Military Student Officer (IMSO). Each Air Force installation will appoint
an IMSO to handle administrative affairs per AFI 16-105. Training units conducting security
assistance training, to include orientations, must maintain a close liaison with their installation
IMSO. The FLT/CC will notify the IMSO anytime a student is entered into CAP for academic
or flying deficiencies, placed on extended DNIF, or for any other reason that could change the
student’s scheduled graduation status. In turn, IMSO will immediately notify the applicable Air
Force Security Assistance Training (AFSAT) country manager, who will keep country informed
on all student issues.
6.3. Training Administration. AFSAT administers all international technical, flying,
professional military education, and basic military training within AETC. Units will send
questions about administrative procedures to the installation IMSO who, in turn, will notify the
appropriate AFSAT country manager.
6.4. Student Data Screening. Training units will screen student records as outlined in AFI 16-
105. The installation IMSO will conduct a thorough review of the student’s invitational travel
order (ITO) and appropriate amendments according to AFI 16-105.
6.5. Student Training Records. The IMSO will maintain student training records according to
AFI 16-105.
6.6. Assigning and Using Student Training Numbers. The U.S. Security Assistance office
from the IMS’s country will assign a student training number, consisting of four digits and two
letters and appearing immediately after the student’s name on the ITO. Enter this number
immediately after the student’s name on all records, certificates, awards, and other similar
documents.
6.7. Training Summary. Training units will:
   6.7.1. Use AETC Form 240-5; DD Form 2496, International Student Academic Report; or
   an AETC/A3F-approved substitute for the training summary. Note: The base IMSO will
   assist training units to complete required forms.
   6.7.2. Enter the SATP training number after the student’s name.
   6.7.3. Record awards, special certificates, or other achievements after the course summary
   section. The training unit will attach a copy of award citations, letters of appreciation,
   certificates, etc., to the training summary. The installation IMSO is responsible for
 48                            AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013


   complying with AFI 16-105. The training unit will ensure the IMSO is aware of special
   awards of citations accompanying the training summary.
   6.7.4. Enter the foreign country and IMET program year (or FMS case designator) and
   worksheet control number (WCN) in the top right corner of the AETC Form 240-5 (above
   “training base”). The training unit may obtain this data from the ITO or the base IMSO.
   Note: When using the DD Form 2496, enter this data in the appropriate blocks.
6.8. Additional Flying Hours:
   6.8.1. Requesting Additional Hours. With OG/CC approval, the IMSO will request
   additional aircraft hours from the appropriate AFSAT country manager to obtain country
   approval (for JSUPT, hours in excess of the 10 additional hours authorized by the syllabus).
   The request must include the student’s name, country, FMS case, line number, WCN,
   approximate number of additional hours required, and a summary of the student’s problems
   and the probability for successful course completion. On the request, include AETC/A3FP,
   AETC/A3RA and AETC/IA as informational addressees. OG/CC approval to fly additional
   sorties on an international student does not automatically increase the installation's
   programmed allocation of flying hours for the year. Any increase in programmed flying
   hours must be accomplished through the normal execution year flying hour adjustment
   process.
   6.8.2. Reporting Procedures for Additional Sorties or Hours. To ensure a student’s
   country is appropriately charged for additional sorties or hours flown, the IMSO will provide
   the following information within five duty days after course graduation to AFSAT
   RANDOLPH AFB TX//DO// (message) or mail to: AFSAT.workflow@randolph.af.mil
   (E-mail attachment):
       6.8.2.1. Student’s name.
       6.8.2.2. Training unit and base.
       6.8.2.3. Military articles and services listing number.
       6.8.2.4. WCN.
       6.8.2.5. Country, case, line, or IMET program year.
       6.8.2.6. Number of additional hours approved.
       6.8.2.7. Number of additional hours flown.
       6.8.2.8. Type of aircraft flown.
       6.8.2.9. Fiscal year when the hours were flown.
       6.8.2.10. Start training date and graduation date.
       6.8.2.11. POC name and telephone number.
6.9. Holiday Scheduling. All international military students may be authorized an additional
two days each year to observe national and (or) religious holidays. Coordinate specific days for
each country through AFSAT and the IMSO.
6.10. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) International Student Leave. The class flight commander
or the next available person in the DO chain of command will coordinate with the IMSO to
AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013                                             49


ensure compliance with Air Force security assistance training requirements as governed by AFI
16-105, Joint Security Cooperation Education and Training.
   6.10.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) The installation commander can authorize 7 days of
   non-chargeable leave between courses and authorized holidays per joint security assistance
   training (JSAT). The IMSO is appointed to act as the 14 OG/CC representative for
   international matters and will determine if non-chargeable leave rules have been met and
   permission to depart can be granted.

                                                           Chapter 7

                                      UPT STUDENT ASSIGNMENT PROCESS

7.1. Overview:
7.1.1. Students receive track and MWS assignments based on demonstrated potential to
successfully complete required follow-on training. Track and MWS assignments consider
three elements:
             7.1.1.1. Needs of the Air Force.
             7.1.1.2. Track or assignment availability.
             7.1.1.3. Student desires.
     7.1.2. To aid commanders in these decisions, MASS, a command-directed performance
     measurement tool, is provided. MASS provides student relative ranking within his or her
     class at each base and is used for student advanced track selection, MWS assignment, and
     final graduation order of merit.
     7.1.3. The WG/CC is the approval authority for all track selection and MWS assignment
     decisions. Any waivers or deviations from this process must originate from the WG/CC for
     review by AETC/A3F.
7.2. Career Information:
     7.2.1. Before track assignment and again before MWS assignment, wings will provide
     students with MWS-specific career information. This information should help students make
     informed choices when requesting specific training tracks or aircraft. Specific information
     should include mission duties, career path and advancement opportunities, and average TDY
     commitments.
     7.2.2. Units will brief students that, under the current Total Force Absorption Plan, active
     duty graduates may be assigned to reserve component units. Present the information via
     briefings, career days, and (or) other practical means. UPT wings should also consider
     sponsoring career day activities along with the base’s annual open house or airshow. JSUPT
     students will make their career requests on AF IMT 3849, PME/AFIT/RTFB/Officer
     Worksheet, or local OG/CC-approved form. Figure 7.1 is an example AF IMT 3849. Note:
     Inform students with special-needs dependents or other special circumstances to make these
     situations known to their chain of command.

7.3. Merit Assignment Selection System:
    7.3.1. FLT/CC or appropriate squadron representative will present a comprehensive briefing
    to each class to ensure understanding of the MASS methodology. The FLT/CC or other
    appropriate squadron representative must ensure he or she subsequently briefs any student
    who is unavoidably absent.
    7.3.2. MASS generates a merit ranking which is an overall assessment of the student’s
    airmanship and capability based upon demonstrated performance. It includes the FLT/CC’s
    assessment of the student’s flying skills, leadership, teamwork, officership, attitude, and
    potential to complete follow-on training.
 52                           AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013


   7.3.3. A TIMS/GTIMS MASS transaction is required for each UPT class after the primary
   (track selection) and advanced (MWS assignment) phase. Run a finalized MASS to
   determine class merit order for each JSUPT and ENJJPT class after the primary and
   advanced phases. The training unit must finalize the MASS prior to class phase graduation
   and after any and all intermediate MASS calculations are complete. OG/CC ensures a
   finalized MASS is performed in TIMS/GTIMS.
7.4. Computing MASS Standardized Scores. Use the following statistical methodology to
compute MASS standardized scores.
   7.4.1. Mean ():




Note: N is the number of students in the class, and Xi is the individual’s score (academic
examination average, daily maneuver score, check score, etc.).
   7.4.2. Standard deviation ():




Note: N and Xi are defined in paragraph 7.4.1, and x is the mean score for the category
(academic examination average mean, daily maneuver score mean, check evaluation score
mean).
   7.4.3. Number of standard deviations from the mean (z-score):




   7.4.4. T-score: T = 50 + 10 (z-score). Tscores are weighted according to these calculations.
   Add the weighted T-scores to compute the total merit score.
   7.4.5. Compute maneuver (M) scores for daily flying and check performance based on the
   following formula:




       7.4.5.1. Each maneuver has scores for unable, fair, good, and excellent. Critical
       maneuvers are weighted more heavily. (Landing is weighted more than aileron roll.)
       Weighted grade values for individual maneuvers are available in the maneuver grade
       files. For an incomplete sortie or a PC/EC sortie following a failed category check, the
       maneuver score is based on the first graded attempt of the maneuver.
AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013                                                      53


       7.4.5.2. AETC/A3FP determines subarea weights.
7.5. JSUPT Merit Ranking. Use preflight and primary data for track selection only. Use only
advanced data to determine assignment selection rank, as appropriate. Use the MASS tables
located      on       the      AETC/A3F          website,      https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=s6925EC13492A0FB5E044080020E329A9.
7.6. ENJJPT Merit Ranking. Assignment merit ranking is based on 40 percent T-6A and 60
percent T-38C performance. Use the MASS tables located on the AETC/A3F website,
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=s6925EC13492A0FB5E044080020E329A9.
7.7. Joint Air Force/Navy JSUPT Merit Ranking (NAS Whiting Field). Base the T-6B merit
ranking on the following weightings:




7.8. USN Primary Flight Training Merit Ranking. Base the merit ranking for USN students
attending T-6A primary training on the following weighting:
7.9. Example Calculation. This example calculates the T-6A total score for JSUPT. Similar
methodology applies to the other UPT programs.
   7.9.1. Category Check Maneuver Scores. Compute using percentage score, multiply by
   weighting factor, and total. Use this total to compute a T-score for category check
   maneuvers.
 Midphase Contact    215 pts received/235 pts possible   =   .91489 × 100   =   91.489 × .16   =    14.638
 Contact             228 pts received/235 pts possible   =   .97021 × 100   =   97.021 × .28   =    27.166
 Instrument          232 pts received/235 pts possible   =   .98723 × 100   =   98.723 × .28   =    27.642
 Formation           339 pts received/365 pts possible   =    92876 × 100   =   92.876 × .28   =    26.005
                                                             Total Category Check Points =          95.451

Note: Assuming the mean for this class’s category checks is 93.422 with a standard deviation of
3.270, then this student’s 95.451 total category check points yield a z-score of +0.6208, resulting
in a category check maneuver T-score of 56.208.

Category Check Score          =      95.451

Category Check T-Score        =    56.208

   7.9.2. Daily Performance Scores. Compute the daily performance scores using a T-score
   generated from student’s daily maneuver percentage score.
 Daily Maneuvers      (9601 pts received/14286 pts possible)    =   .67206 × 100
                                                                               =             67.206
                                                                      Class Mean
                                                                               =             71.237
                                                               Standard Deviation
                                                                               =              5.941
                                                                          z-Score
                                                                               =          (–0.6783)
                                                        Daily Maneuver T-Score =              43.217

Note: Assuming the mean for this class’s daily maneuvers is 71.237 and a standard deviation of
5.941, then this student’s 67.206 total points yield a z-score of –0.6783 resulting in a daily
maneuver T-score of 43.217.
   7.9.3. Academic Scores. Students’ academic test averages are used to compute their z-
   scores. Only the first test attempt counts in the student’s academic test average. Instructors
   will ensure all retakes of failed academic tests are entered as retakes.
 Academic Test Average           =     96.891
 Class Mean                      =     96.060
 Standard Deviation              =      1.886
 z-Score                         =      0.4883
 Academic Check T-Score          =     54.883

Note: In this example, the student’s academic test average is 96.891. Assuming the class
average is 96.060 with a standard deviation of 1.886, then the resulting z-score is +0.4883
yielding an academic T-score of 54.883.
   7.9.4. FLT/CC Ranking. Use the FLT/CC ranking scores to compute a z-score. In this
   example, we use a ranking of 5 out of 15 = 95.71.
 FLT/CC Ranking (5th of 15)      =     95.710
 Class Mean                      =     92.500
 Standard Deviation              =      4.652
 z-Score                         =       0.690
 FLT/CC Ranking T-Score          =       56.90

Note: By design, the mean for all classes’ FLT/CC ranking is 92.50. However the standard
deviation varies depending on class size. In this case, we use a standard deviation of 4.652; then
this student’s 95.710 yields a z-score of +0.690, resulting in a FLT/CC ranking T-score of
56.900.

7.10. JSUPT Student Assignment Process. This section applies only to U.S. students at
Columbus, Laughlin, and Vance AFBs, and Fort Rucker.
   7.10.1. Track Assignment Process:
      7.10.1.1. Overview. Use the T-6A merit order to assist with assigning advanced training
      tracks. AETC/A3R will allocate and forward advanced track authorizations (T-1A, T-
      38C, and TH-1H) to each JSUPT wing based on each wing’s assignment-eligible students
      no later than five duty days before the primary phase completion date. Tracks are
      assigned during the last week of primary training after all assignment-eligible students
      have completed their category checks.
   7.10.1.2. Merit Order Calculation. Each OG/CC will compute the T-6A merit order for
   all U.S. students. Each FLT/CC will rank assigned students using the matrix in Figure 7.2.
   Merge the two flight merit orders, producing a class standing (merit order) by total point
   score (no ties).
      7.10.1.3. Track Assignment Procedures:
          7.10.1.3.1. Prior to track assignment, each student will complete AF IMT 3849, Part
          II, to indicate a preference order for advanced training. The student’s assigned IP will
          make a training recommendation for each track on the AF IMT 3849. Figure 7.1
          provides a sample AF IMT 3849, including information needed in Part IV. The
          FLT/CC will concur or nonconcur with remarks. (Note: Remarks are required if the
          FLT/CC nonconcurs with the IP’s recommendation. These remarks may be
          continued on the back of the form, if necessary.) Base the recommendation on each
          student’s demonstrated skills and potential to complete advanced training.
          7.10.1.3.2. The SQ/CC and FLT/CCs will convene and assign students to advanced
          training, as follows:
             7.10.1.3.2.1. Rank students for advanced training in merit order.
             7.10.1.3.2.2. Give the top 10 percent of graduates their first choice if available.
             For example, in a class of 15 students, the top 10 percent would be 1.5 students.
             Round numbers .5 and above to the next higher number, making the top 10
             percent (in this example) two students.
             7.10.1.3.2.3. Use rank order listing and the student’s AF IMT 3849 to provide the
             best match of the student’s skills, potential, desires, and available training quotas.
             Students receive their first choice of an advanced training track if it is available
             and if the individual student’s IP and FLT/CC recommend the student for that
                 56                                           AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013


                                     track.
                                     7.10.1.3.2.4. Go to the second (third, etc.) choice when the student’s first choice
                                     is not available or the student is not recommended for that track. If that track is
                                     available and the student is recommended, assign the student to that track.
                                     7.10.1.3.2.5. Assign the quota for students not recommended for a specific
                                     training quota to a student recommended for that training, but previously assigned
                                     to another track (for example, a T-38C quota is unfilled, but remaining students
                                     are not recommended for T-38C training). This frees up the training quota
                                     previously assigned but may require additional changes. In all cases, consider the
                                     student’s skill, potential, and desires as well as the needs of the Air Force when
                                     assigning advanced training.
                                7.10.1.3.3. The WG/CC is actively involved in the track selection process. The
                                WG/CC is the approving authority to ensure students are assigned to JSUPT tracks
                                based on demonstrated potential to successfully complete the track.
                                7.10.1.3.4. The OG/CC will forward copies of the final merit order and track
                                assignment to AETC/A3RA within two duty days after final approval.
                                7.10.1.3.5. Units will report any student bound for a fighter or bomber track with a
                                MASS rating below 50 to AETC/A3FP and AETC/A3G or AETC/A3H, as
                                appropriate.

the class as a single entity (for example, 0604 T-6A, not 0604 T-6A A FLT and 0604 T-6A B FLT) and then
assign the students into their specific flights. Contact AETC/A3F for questions regarding MASS calculations.

          7.10.2. MWS Assignment Process. Students receive MWS assignments based on their
          potential to successfully complete required follow-on training. After receiving assignments
          from AFPC/DPAOT and not later than 11 duty days before the scheduled assignment night,
          AETC/A1KO will provide the JSUPT WG/CCs with their respective assignment block and
          those of the other bases. If an appropriate MWS assignment is not available in the
          assignment block, WG/CCs may work assignment swaps (within an assignment block) with
          other WG/CCs to better meet Air Force needs and student desires. WG/CCs may also
          request the assistance of AETC/A1KO to obtain an appropriate MWS assignment based on a
          suitable match with the student’s skill and potential. Coordinate assignment swaps with
          AETC/A1KO and accomplish them before students receive their assignments. AETC/A1K is
          the final approving authority for assignment block distribution between the JSUPT bases.
          Assignment night is no later than two weeks (one week for JSUPT-H) before graduation.
          Use the advanced track merit order to assist with MWS aircraft and location assignments, as
          follows:
             7.10.2.1. Merit Order Calculation. The OG/CC will compute the T-1A and T-38C
             merit order for all U.S. students. The 23 FTS/CC will compute the TH-1H merit order
             for all U.S. students. T-1A students must complete transition and navigation category
             checks to compete for assignment with their class. T-38C students must complete
             transition, two-ship formation, and instrument/navigation category checks to compete for
             assignment with their class. Contact AETC/A3F for MASS calculation questions.
             7.10.2.2. MWS Assignment Procedures.
                 7.10.2.2.1. The FLT/CC will assess T-38C student performance no later than three
                 weeks prior to assignment night. If a student’s demonstrated performance marks him
                 or her as a better candidate for a crew aircraft, the FLT/CC will make every effort to
58                      AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013


     secure a bomber slot for the student; however, the student may be assigned to fixed-
     wing aircraft outside the normal specialization based on the needs of the Air Force.
     7.10.2.2.2. Before assignment night, all students will complete AF IMT 3849,
     indicating (in order) their choice of MWS aircraft. The assigned IP (FLT/CC for
     JSUPT-H) will make a first assignment instructor pilot (FAIP) recommendation for
     each student on AF IMT 3849. Base the recommendation on the student’s
     demonstrated flying and interpersonal skills, maturity, and potential to return as an
     FAIP. The FLT/CC concurs or nonconcurs (with remarks for nonconcur).
     7.10.2.2.3. Identify FAIPs with a follow-on assignment to one of two generic tracks
     (fighter/bomber or tanker/airlift). For helicopter FAIPs, within the constraints of an
     Air Staff-approved JSUPT-H FAIP program, identify those graduates with a follow-
     on assignment to their mission area (Special Operations or Combat Search and
     Rescue). WG/CCs will not change this FAIP assignment process.
     7.10.2.2.4. The SQ/CC and FLT/CCs will convene and assign students MWS aircraft
     as follows:
        7.10.2.2.4.1. Rank students in merit order for MWS aircraft.
        7.10.2.2.4.2. If available, the top 10 percent of graduates should receive their first
        choice. For example, in a class of 15 students, the top 10 percent would be 1.5
        students. Round numbers .5 and above to the next higher number, making the top
        10 percent (in this example) two students. Note: Do not assign FAIP duty to the
        top 10 percent unless they specifically volunteer.
        7.10.2.2.4.3. Use the rank order listing and the student’s AF IMT 3849 to provide
        the best match of the student’s desires with available MWS aircraft.
        7.10.2.2.4.4. When a quota for an FAIP is unfilled and the remaining students are
        not recommended for FAIP duty, assign the quota to a student recommended for
        FAIP duty but previously assigned to another aircraft. This frees up the aircraft
        previously assigned and may require additional changes. Note: Individuals are
        not usually selected for FAIP duty in an aircraft they did not fly in JSUPT. The
        WG/CC requests exceptions to this policy and coordinates through AETC/A3F
        and AETC/A3R, with AETC/A2/3/10 approval.
        7.10.2.2.4.5. For rated management reasons, do not assign FAIP duty to captains
        (as of graduation), even if they volunteer.
     7.10.2.2.5. The WG/CC is actively involved in actions affecting JSUPT students in
     the assignment selection process and makes the final decision on the best match of
     student skill, potential, and desire with available aircraft. The WG/CC will provide a
     list of finalized assignment selections and merit rank order to AETC/A1KO not later
     than one duty day before the scheduled assignment night.
     7.10.2.2.6. AETC/A1KO will check assignment selections for potential errors and
     coordinate with the appropriate WG/CC for final release of student assignments.
     AETC/AIKO will compile the results and forward them to AFPC/DPAOT no later
     than the following Monday after assignment night.
AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013                                                 59


          7.10.2.2.7. Squadron supervisors will establish procedures to announce track and
          assignment drops. In addition, they will closely monitor student performance after
          MWS assignment.
          7.10.2.2.8. When appropriate, squadron, operations group, and wing personnel will
          work with AETC/A1KO to coordinate any assignment changes necessitated by post-
          MWS assignment performance.
   7.10.3. JSUPT-H Assignment Selection Process:
      7.10.3.1. Upon completion of the NVG Remote Procedures unit and before assignment
      day (or night), 23 FTS/CC will compute student merit order. Note: AFPC/DPAOT will
      provide a full assignment block to 58 OG/CC for student review three weeks before
      graduation.
      7.10.3.2. After receiving the aircraft assignment block and before assignment day (or
      night), students will complete an AF IMT 3849, indicating their choice (in order) of
      MWS aircraft.
      7.10.3.3. The 23 FTS/CC and assigned FLT/CCs will convene to assign MWS aircraft,
      using procedures outlined in paragraph 7.10.2.2 for JSUPT assignments. After all
      assignments are made, they will submit the results to the 58 OG/CC for final approval
      who, in turn, will forward copies of the final class merit order and MWS assignments to
      AFPC/DPAOT within two duty days after final approval.
7.11. JSUPT (Navy) Track Assignment Process (NAS Whiting Field-Air Force Students
Only):
   7.11.1. Merit Order Calculation. Use the T-6B merit ranking to assign advanced training.
   The senior Air Force officer (SAFO) will compute merit ranking. Contact AETC/A3F for
   MASS calculation questions.
   7.11.2. Track Assignment Procedures:
      7.11.2.1. The SAFO will coordinate with AETC/A3RA for advanced track training
      quotas when Air Force students are scheduled to complete the primary track. Students
      will rank-order their choices for advanced training on AF IMT 3849. The Air Force- or
      Navy-assigned IP will make training recommendations.
      7.11.2.2. To ensure equitable track select opportunity for students, AETC/A3RA will
      provide advanced training, depending upon available class dates and PFT quotas.
      Students must be grouped (normally four to six to a group) before being assigned an
      advanced training track.
      7.11.2.3. Once a group is formed and advanced training quotas are allocated, the
      FLT/CC and SQ/CC will meet to determine track assignments based on AF IMT 3849
      comments, as follows:
          7.11.2.3.1. If a first choice is available and the student is recommended, assign that
          training.
          7.11.2.3.2. If a first choice is not available or the student is not recommended, go to
          the next choice until a match is found. In all cases, consider the student’s skill,
 60                          AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013


         potential, and desires as well as the needs of the Air Force when assigning advanced
         training.
         7.11.2.3.3. Once all track selections are decided, forward recommendations to the
         training WG/CC for approval.
      7.11.2.4. The WG/CC is actively involved and will participate in all assignment actions
      affecting track selection.
7.12. ENJJPT Student Assignment Process (U. S. Students):
   7.12.1. Merit Order Calculation.
      7.12.1.1. The U.S. SNR, student training FLT/CC, and MTO will compute the merit
      order for ENJJPT students. (FLT/CC ranking of U.S. students uses ENJJPT officer
      quality evaluation scores.) The total point score determines class standing (merit order).
      7.12.1.2. The official MASS score is always a full class MASS. The TIMS/GTIMS
      student manager must identify the class as a single entity (for example, 0604 T-6A, not
      0604 T-6A A FLT and 0604 T-6A B FLT) and then assign the students into their specific
      flights. Contact AETC/A3F for questions regarding MASS calculations.
      7.12.1.3. Each student must have completed T-38C contact and (or) transition,
      instrument, basic formation, and advanced formation category checks to compete for
      assignment with that class. In case of unforeseen circumstances that prevent the
      completion of any one of these category checks by all students in the class, the OG/CD
      will determine what point in training to use as the cutoff for the MASS computation.
   7.12.2. MWS Assignment Process:
      7.12.2.1. AETC/A1KO will, after receiving assignments from AFPC/DPAOT, provide
      the assignment block to the WG/CC and inform the U.S. SNR three weeks before
      graduation.   Match students to assignments according to ENJJPT procedures.
      Assignment night is no later than two weeks before graduation.
      7.12.2.2. Two weeks before assignment night, U.S. students will rank-order their choices
      of MWS aircraft on AF IMT 3849 (location information optional) and provide them to
      the FLT/CC.
      7.12.2.3. One week before assignment night, the assigned IP, FLT/CC, and MTO will
      review the AF IMT 3849, make appropriate FAIP recommendations, and forward them to
      the student training FLT/CC. For rated management reasons, do not assign FAIP duty to
      captains (as of graduation), even if they volunteer.
      7.12.2.4. The MTO, student training FLT/CC, and U.S. SNR (who coordinate as
      required with SQ/CCs) will convene and assign students to MWS aircraft using the
      guidance outlined for JSUPT and ENJJPT.
      7.12.2.5. The WG/CC will approve and forward a copy of the final class merit order and
      MWS assignment matches to AETC/A1KO no later than one duty day before assignment
      night.
AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013                                       61


     7.12.2.6. AETC/A1KO will compile the results and forward them to AFPC/DPAOT no
     later than the following Monday after assignment night. This completes all actions
     required to process the assignments.

                                    STUDENT AWARDS

Section 8A—UPT

8.1. Overview. The WG/CC will establish and maintain a program to present awards to
students selected as outstanding in academics, military qualities, and flying training. Duplicate
awards may be presented for ties. AFI 36-2805, Special Trophies and Awards, governs
appropriations for such awards. A wing awards council or similar process will nominate and
select students for awards approved by the WG/CC. (Note: Air Force students graduating from
NAS Pensacola are eligible to compete for Navy naval flight officer awards.) ENJJPT Steering
Committee Directive 3-1 and 80th FTW guidance determine ENJJPT student awards available
only through the local Sheppard AFB intranet.
   8.1.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Additional 14 FTW SUPT Awards given (see
   Attachment 8).
8.2. Distinguished Graduate (DG) Awards. Each OG/CC may select DGs from the students
in each track of a class and present them a plaque during graduation. For each class, the OG/CC
is the final approving authority for all awards. As a minimum, a DG award requires a student to
be in the upper 10 percent of the graduating class. Use MASS data from both the primary and
advanced phases. If primary phase MASS data is unavailable, use only advanced phase MASS
data. JSUPT-H may use MASS data only from the advanced phase. Select DGs from the upper
10 percent of each track. (Round numbers .5 and above to the next higher number.) If a DG is
an ANG or AFRC member, notify AETC/A3G or AETC/A3H, as appropriate, as soon as
possible to ensure appropriate representation.
8.3. Order of Daedalians AETC Commander’s Trophy. This award is presented to the
student in each class with the highest MASS score from each track using the combined MASS
data from the primary and advanced phases of JSUPT. The score is weighted using 25 percent
Primary and 75 percent Advanced. If primary phase MASS data is unavailable, use only
advanced phase MASS data. The OG/CC notifies the Order of Daedalians of the recipient’s
name before class graduation and presentation. The WG/CC (or designated representative)
presents the trophies during the graduation ceremony. The trophy is a 7-inch tall, cast bronze
statue of an eagle with outstretched wings and talons, mounted on a 1 1/2-inch tall circular
bronze base. Attach a suitable brass plate to the base and engrave as follows:

                      DAEDALIAN AETC COMMANDER’S TROPHY

                                       (Grade and Name)

                                       (Class and Base)


8.4. Academic and Flying Training Awards. The academic training award is presented to the
student in each track with the highest academic MASS score for the primary and advanced
AETCI36-2205V4_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2013                                                63


phases. The flying training award is presented to the student in each track with the highest
combined daily sortie and category check sortie MASS scores for both the primary and advanced
phases. The OG/CC is the approving authority for these awards. If primary phase MASS data is
unavailable, use only advanced phase MASS data to determine the academic/flying training
award recipients.
8.5. Orville Wright Achievement Award:
   8.5.1. This Daedalian Foundation award is given to the most outstanding JSUPT or ENJJPT
   graduate of the quarter and consists of an engraved plaque and a citation presented by a
   member of the Order of Daedalians. Students of any military branch are eligible for this
   award, presented quarterly.
   8.5.2. Each UPT base will nominate one student per quarter. Send the nomination
   memorandum to AETC/A3FP within 10 duty days after the end of the quarter when the
   nominee graduated.        Include a biographical sketch of the nominee and training
   accomplishments in the memorandum. Attach a copy of the nominee’s AETC Form 240-5
   and official orders or forwarding address to the memorandum.
   8.5.3. An award board at AETC/A3F will select the award recipient. AETC/A3F will
   inform the units, the gaining squadron commander, and the Order of Daedalians of the
   graduate selected for the award. The Order of Daedalians will forward the award to the
   appropriate base for presentation.
8.6. Awards to IMSs. As soon as possible after the decision is made to present an award to an
IMS, the unit will notify the AFSAT/CC through the base IMSO.

Section 8B—Graduate Pilot Training

8.7. DG Awards:
   8.7.1. Units will develop their own methods of identifying up to the top 10 percent of
   students in basic courses as DGs. Classes of less than 10 may have one DG. Any fractions
   may be rounded upward. Commanders may elect not to designate a DG in a class.
   8.7.2. DG programs recognize students who clearly excel during formal training. Formalize
   the DG program in local guidance. DGs must demonstrate outstanding progress in each
   phase of academic, simulator, and flying training, and outstanding results in flying and
   simulator evaluations. The unit commander is the final approving authority for all awards.
   8.7.3. The DG will receive an AETC Form 499 (or locally approved substitute) signed by
   the unit CC and DO.
