United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) units. This supplement implements tasks and
responsibilities for storing electronic records on main operating base and geographically
separated unit shared storage servers. It establishes how units will manage electronic records in
that environment and provides guidance for storage of official electronic records and personal
working files using a shared network drive. It does not apply to Air National Guard (ANG) or
Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units. Coordinate proposed supplements with the
Command Records Manager (AFCA/EASM), 203 W. Losey St., Rm. 1100, Scott AFB, IL 62225
or email afca.easm.rm@us.af.mil prior to publication. Ensure that all records created as a result
of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual
33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in Air Force Records Information Management System
(AFRIMS) at Air Force (AF) Portal: https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm)
SUMMARY OF CHANGES
Supplemented publication and numbering updated. AFRIMS section deleted.
6.22.1. (Added) Managing and Storing Electronic Records on Shared Storage Servers.
   6.22.1.1. (Added) Overview and Objectives. The Chief of Staff of the Air Force and
2                                                         AFMAN33-363 25 NOVEMBER 2008


Secretary of the Air Force directed consolidation of network servers to dramatically improve
operations and significantly reduce Air Force information technology total cost of ownership. In
USAFE, main operating bases (MOB) and geographically separated units (GSU) will be
supported by consolidated network storage servers to carry out this directive. At locations where
a Storage Area Network (SAN) is not available or feasible, base-level communications
squadrons must obtain and designate a drive as the shared electronic storage space for their
installation’s official electronic records. This dedicated electronic storage space should function
as a central electronic repository for filing official records.
       6.22.1.1.1. (Added) The shared storage server provides a single repository for
       information and an effective electronic file and record management structure for users.
       The Network Operations and Security Center (NOSC) provides storage space to each
       installation, the installation Communications Squadrons maintain the storage space for
       their installation, and data owners are responsible for managing their stored information.
       6.22.1.1.2. (Added) The shared storage servers provide storage space for official
       electronic records, official working files, and non-official personal working files. An
       official electronic record is a computer generated file that documents the transaction of
       official Air Force business. Electronic personal working files consist of work-related
       diaries, journals, personal calendars, appointment schedules, etc., and exist for personal
       use to assist in conducting (but not transacting) Air Force business. The official record is
       complete with attachments or related data when filed. Once the electronic document
       becomes the official record it will not be changed, modified, or altered. To preserve the
       integrity of official records save the official file copy as a read-only record.
    6.22.1.2. (Added) Drive Structure. Each shared storage server will be divided into four
    separate storage drives which segregate different types of data as follows:
       6.22.1.2.1. (Added) Official (“O:” drive) is the network resource used to store official
       records. The directory structure is based on organization and office symbols which
       maintain official records and have an approved file plan in AFRIMS (Figure 6.5.
       (Added)). File retention is determined by the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule
       (RDS) located in AFRIMS on the Air Force Portal. Each office of record folder on the
       “O:” drive will contain the following folders:
           6.22.1.2.1.1. (Added) 00-Electronic File Box-Contains official records that the end
           user drags and drops from a shared drive, local hard-drive, or Outlook (if they do not
           know which file on the e-file plan to place it) for filing by the Records Custodian
           (RC).
           6.22.1.2.1.2. (Added) 01- File Maintenance and Disposition (Media Neutral)-
           Contains a copy of the approved file plan exported from AFRIMS. It is a record
           keeping requirement to store the official file plan with the file folders it governs.
           6.22.1.2.1.3. (Added) All folders, numbered as listed on the approved file plan,
           where electronic official files exist. Each folder will contain a sub-folder named XX-
           00 (where XX is the file number from the approved AFRIMS file plan) containing the
           applicable table and rule extracted from the RDS. Individuals will file directly to the
           applicable e-file on the file plan unless they do not know which one to file to and then
           they will place the file in the 00-Electronic File Box for the RC to file.

          6.22.1.2.1.4. (Added) Inactive Files Folder-Contains records that have met cutoff
          (Fiscal Year (FY) or Calendar Year (CY)) but not met their retention period
          according to Air Force RDS located in AFRIMS. These records will be retained in
          the inactive folder by year group until they are either eligible for destruction or
          removal to off-line storage in accordance with the Air Force (AF) RDS until eligible
          to be transferred to the appropriate National Records Center for storage.
Figure 6.5. (Added) The Electronic Record “O:” Drive Structure.




      6.22.1.2.2. (Added) Organizational Shared (“S:” drive) is the network resource provided
      for storage of organizational data needing to be shared base-wide (enterprise-wide in the
      future). There is a single “S:” drive and all base users will share this common path. Each
      organization will have a folder on the organizational drive with subfolders to the office
      level. Organizations may use the “S:” drive to maintain or share tasks-in-progress and as
      a temporary holding bin for official, nonrecord information (i.e. promotion/ retirement
      invites, barbecue flyers, etc.). Additionally, the “S:” drive will have an Official
      Multimedia folder containing official multimedia files. Recommend each office set the
      top folders as: Templates, Reference, Working, and Collaboration for organizational
      purposes. The Network Control Center (NCC), Client Support Administrators (CSA),
      and end users will be responsible for maintaining this area. The “S:” drive folders must
      be, by default, accessible to all authenticated base personnel. This is to meet the
      requirements for inter-organization data sharing. Due to access availability, do not file
      any Privacy Act, Personal Health Information (PHI) and Confidential Data (HIPPA) or
      other sensitive information on “S:” drive.
             6.22.1.2.2.1. (Added) The “S:” drive storage area is not for official records.

           Once a task/document is completed or an event has passed, the information owner
           will remove it from the “S:” drive, and either properly file it into the appropriate file
           on the e-file plan or the 00-Electronic File Box (if they do not know the appropriate
           file) on “O:” drive, or dispose of it accordingly. To assist in preventing storage limits
           from being exceeded based on allocation guidelines established by the NOSC, files
           that have not been modified for more than 365 days and unauthorized files (paragraph
           6.22.1.3.4. (Added)) will be identified weekly by the NCC and provided to the
           organization for disposition.
           6.22.1.2.2.2. (Added) Set the file attribute to “Read Only” when saving files to the
           “S:” drive that must be shared but also must remain intact.
       6.22.1.2.3. (Added) Office-Restricted (“R:” drive) is the network resource provided to
       share office-specific information. Access to the “R:” drive is limited to members
       assigned to the office. Offices may use the “R:” drive to maintain working or reference
       files that only pertain to the office. Working data files such as recall rosters, leave
       schedules, temporary duty (TDY) schedules, duty schedules, and internal office
       procedures may reside on the “R:” drive; the official copies need to be filed on the “O”
       drive. Do not store official records on the “R:” drive. The NCC, CSAs, and end users
       will be responsible for maintaining this area. To prevent storage limits from being
       exceeded based on allocation guidelines established by the NOSC, files that have not
       been modified in more than 365 days and unauthorized file (paragraph 6.22.1.3.4.
       (Added)) will be identified weekly by the NCC and provided to the organization for
       proper disposition.
       6.22.1.2.4. (Added) User (“U:” drive) is the network resource provided for users to store
       personal information (electronic work related personal papers and background materials),
       non-record information, personal working files or copies of official tasks in progress.
       AFI 33-364, Records Disposition - Procedures and Responsibilities, governs the
       maintenance, storage, and disposition of electronic personal records. Each personal
       folder on the “U:” drive will utilize the naming convention firstname.lastname (i.e.,
       john.doe) for that individual. All end-users will have a personal folder on the “U:” drive.
       Users will not store official files on the “U:” drive. Users are responsible for maintaining
       the file permissions for the content within their personal workspace and ensuring that
       their storage utilization does not exceed their quota limitation established by the NOSC.
    6.22.1.3. (Added) File Restrictions. The following file types will not be stored on the “O:”,
    “S:”, “R:”, or “U:” drives:
       6.22.1.3.1. (Added) Permanent backups and archives of desktop and portable computer
       hard drives. Files of this type will be deleted by the NCC/CSA (for “R:”, “S:”, and “U:”
       drives) or Base Records Manager (BRM)/ Functional Area Records Manager (FARM)/
       RC (for “O:” drive) 10 work days after creation. Desktop and portable computer data is
       commonly copied to network storage during personnel moves, computer replacement or
       upgrades. User data, such as documents may be copied to network storage (“U:” drive);
       however, entire hard disks (program files and Windows installation directory) will not be
       copied to network storage.
       6.22.1.3.2. (Added) Libraries. Publications and forms that are available on official
       publication web sites will be downloaded as needed from official sources and will not be
AFMAN33-363 25 NOVEMBER 2008                                                                    5


     duplicated on network storage.
     6.22.1.3.3. (Added) Software installation files. Where required, these files will be hosted
     by the communications squadron in a storage area that does not consume backup
     resources. Recovery to this area will be from the original installation media.
     6.22.1.3.4. (Added) Personal data files including *.wav, *.jpg, *.mp3, *.mpeg, *.avi,
     *.pst, *:tmp, *. exe, *.ost, *.oab, *.wmv, *. mov, *.tif, *.bin, *.iso, *.nrg, *.vob, *.m4a,
     *.dll, *.sys, *.ocx, *.vbx, *.vxd, *.drv, *.scr, *.cpl, *.gho, *.msc and any other files
     extensions of these types. The only exception to this is *.pst files which may be stored
     on the “U:” drive and must adhere to applicable guidance. The NOSC will implement
     filters to the organization/office folders of the “R:” and “S:” drives (with the exception of
     the “Multimedia” folder in the organizations root directory) to prevent additional files of
     these types from being saved to these shared drives. The NCC will make
     recommendations to the NOSC to add additional file extensions to the command
     unauthorized files list. The NOSC will provide any additions to this list via Notice to
     Airmen (NOTAM).
     6.22.1.3.5. (Added) Electronic Records Management (ERM). The “R:” and “S:” drives
     have been established for ERM working file storage. The only files authorized on the
     “R:” and “S:” drives are those having a requirement to be collaborated on by more than
     one user. As a rule, these will be “living” documents that are accessed or updated on a
     regular basis. The “O:” drive is for official records storage only. The shared drives
     “R:”,“S:” and “U:” are not for archiving personal files.
  6.22.1.4. (Added) Roles and Responsibilities. The following paragraphs identify additional
  roles and responsibilities required for effective management of electronic records on shared
  storage servers.
     6.22.1.4.1. (Added) AFCA/EASM provides guidance and policy on file cleanup of
     shared drives and records management.
     6.22.1.4.2. (Added) Commanders and Directors will ensure individuals appointed as
     BRM, FARM, Chief of Office of Record (COR), and RC receive appropriate training
     within 90 days of appointment.
     6.22.1.4.3. (Added) Network Operations and Security Center (NOSC) will:
         6.22.1.4.3.1. (Added) Manage and configure shared storage servers to provide the
         four shared network drives.
         6.22.1.4.3.2. (Added) Work with the base NCC to establish sizing of storage server
         resources.
         6.22.1.4.3.3. (Added) Work with the base NCC to establish and enforce allocation
         limitations on the four shared network drives, based on available storage resources.
         6.22.1.4.3.4. (Added) Ensure regular backups of the shared network drives. Ensuring
         daily backups of the “O:” drive are maintained a minimum of 90 days and maximum
         of 120 days for restoration purposes. Maintain “R:”, “S:”, and “U:” drive backups, up
         to 30 days, based on availability of resources.
         6.22.1.4.3.5. (Added) Apply filters to the “R:” and “S:” drives to preclude
6                                                         AFMAN33-363 25 NOVEMBER 2008


            introduction of additional unauthorized file type to these shared drives. (Exception:
            the “Multimedia” folder in each units root directory.)
         6.22.1.4.4. (Added) Network Control Centers (NCC) will:
            6.22.1.4.4.1. (Added) Establish and maintain the organizational structuring of data on
            the “R:” and “S:” drive using the current organizational office symbols starting at
            headquarters and squadron two-digit levels (i.e., Commander 52 Communications
            Squadron (52 CS/CC), USAFE Director of Staff (USAFE/DS)) and “U:” drive using
            network login naming convention of firstname.lastname.
            6.22.1.4.4.2. (Added) Assist the BRM in establishing and maintaining the
            organizational structure of data on the “O:” drive. Office folders on this drive will be
            based on office of record loaded in AFRIMS (units with approved file plans).
            6.22.1.4.4.3. (Added) Assist with assigning permissions as outlined in Table 6.2.
            (Added). NCC will not assign FARM/RC permissions to the “O:” drive without
            prior approval and coordination from the BRM.
