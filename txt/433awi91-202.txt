1. General. To ensure the safe use of munitions during training, strict adherence to instruction
is required. Safety principles outlined are also applicable to off-base evaluation/ training sites
when not in conflict with host base regulations. 433rd AW members will coordinate with host
base safety personnel to ensure local safety regulations are being followed. All personnel who
handle, function, and/or transport explosives addressed in this instruction must receive Weapons
Safety training. Personnel performing operations outlined in this instruction must complete and
forward an explosives risk assessment to Wing Safety prior to each exercise.

  4.1. Quantity shown is an example of minimum quantity required to complete the assigned
  exercise objective.
     4.1.1. Simulators and Smoke Producing Munitions. See paragraph 2.35 AFMAN 91-
     201 for licensing requirements. The following applies to the use of these devices during
     exercises and training:
     4.1.2. Only United States Air Force (USAF) stock-listed items are authorized for use.
     Other military services will use Department of Defense (DoD) approved items only,
     when using USAF ranges or facilities.
     4.1.3. Only trained personnel can prepare and activate these devices. Qualified personnel
     will provide training on an annual basis to personnel whose duties require them to initiate
     training simulators. The qualified personnel providing training will be determined locally
     but may be from EOD, munitions, or weapons safety. These qualified trainers must have
     had at least four hours of classroom instruction, passed a written test and be qualified to
     handle, maintain and inspect these items. It is the responsibility of the user organization
     to request training and maintain training records. Higher headquarters evaluation teams
     using these devices must present proof of training to the base safety office, prior to use.
     4.1.4. AFRC qualified personnel are those individuals who are trained and certified by
     EOD to provide simulator and smoke producing munitions training to other base
     personnel. As a minimum, training will be both academic and practical. Academic
     training includes item description and associated hazards; safety and handling
     precautions; technical data warnings/cautions; pre-use/post-use inspection criteria;
     misfire, DUD, and munitions residue disposition procedures. Practical training will not
     commence prior to successful completion of the academic portion.
     4.1.5. Minimum Distances.
     4.1.6. Personnel or vehicle: Maintain a minimum of 125 feet separation. Personnel who
     initiate these munitions may be closer than 125 feet, but they should be as close to 125
     feet as possible and have their back to the munitions. Exception: no specific distance is
     required for non-toxic colored smoke grenades. Avoid the smoke or follow actions
     required in Table 2.3 (AFMAN 91-201)
     4.1.7. Smoke from grenades and pots is sometimes toxic in high concentrations. Contact
     Environmental Management and the Fire Department prior to use. These items, along
     with generators and flares present a fire hazard. Remove combustible materials before
     functioning. Consider winds and fire hazards such as dry grass or fire bans. Consider
     using a barrier to control spread of heat during functioning of grenades and smoke pots.

       4.1.8. Ground burst or hand grenade simulators present a blast hazard. Exercise caution
       around people, facilities and equipment. Free the area of combustible material within a
       ten feet radius. Monitor for proper functioning and disposal of residue. Notify EOD or
       other qualified personnel when munitions malfunction. The on-scene commander will
       determine minimum withdrawal distance for malfunctioned ground burst or hand grenade
       simulators for the given situation. This distance will never be less than the minimum
       distances given in paragraph 2.24.2. AFMAN 91-201 or applicable item Technical Order
