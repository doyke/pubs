SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Added qualified civilians working in Bioenvironmental Engineering to the approved list of
primary and alternate Radiation Safety Officers (RSOs). Increased investigation action levels to
follow current radiation guidance. Added and corrected additional requirements for reporting to
USFK RSO. Updated several references. Added the requirement for unit commanders to ensure
the installation RSO is informed when RAM-containing devices are moved between units and/or
Co-located Operating Bases (COBs). Added requirement to train applicable personnel on the
proper wear and handling of thermo-luminescent dosimeters (TLDs). Specified that radiological
incident reporting instructions are only required in workcenters that own or use RAM or RPDs.
1. Air Force Policy: Air Force policy mandates that all exposures to ionizing radiation will be
ALARA. There should be no exposure to ionizing radiation without an expected benefit and the
dose received should be the lowest possible, consistent with the state of technology, costs, and
operational requirements.
2. Responsibilities at Wing Level:
     2.1. 51 FW/CC will:
        2.1.1. Appoint Bioenvironmental Engineers, or other individual with equivalent radiation
        experience, as the primary and alternate 51 FW RSOs, who will serve as the installation
        RSOs for Osan AB.
        2.1.2. Ensure the installation RSO is notified of all planned uses of RAMs or RPDs on
        the base.
        2.1.3. Ensure all RAM shipments to or from the base are coordinated with the
        installation RSO.
     2.2. 51 AMDS/SGPB will:
        2.2.1. Ensure qualified 43E3A Bioenvironmental Engineers, 4B07/91 Bioenvironmental
        Engineering Technicians, or qualified civilians in the Bioenvironmental Engineering
        Flight are appointed as the primary and alternate installation RSO.
        2.2.2. Develop a formal IRPP to ensure all radiation exposures comply with ALARA
        requirements. Coordinate with each unit RSO to ensure that a comprehensive base-wide
        IRPP exists. Provide consultation to unit RSOs in the development of local guidance and
        publications consistent with the ALARA concept. This instruction acts as a written base
        Ionizing Radiation Protection Plan.
        2.2.3. Perform surveillance of areas where radiation sources are used or stored.
        2.2.4. Review all plans for modification, design, or deployment of RPD or material
        and/or storage/use locations under the control of 51 FW.
        2.2.5. Manage the USAF Personnel Dosimetry Program: The investigation action level
        for Osan AB can be found in paragraph 2.2.10. These levels are investigated and their
        results reported to the Aerospace Medicine Council (AMC).
51FWI48-102 2 MAY 2012                                                                        3


       2.2.6. Accomplish and document IRPP reviews and present results to organization
       commanders and to the 51 FW Integrated Safety Council.
       2.2.7. Document that ALARA training classes are being conducted at least annually for
       all radiation workers. Tailor the level of training to the specific category of personnel
       and hazard potential. Include information regarding risk from radiation exposure; health
       risks to children of women occupationally exposed to radiation during pregnancy;
       maximum permissible dose limits; protective measures required (tailored for specific
       radiation work); and ALARA concept and practice.
       2.2.8. Perform package swipes on outgoing shipments containing RAMs and ensure
       shipping requirements are met in accordance with 49 CFR 173, General Requirements
       for Shipments & Packagings, 10 CFR 20, and AFI 40-201.
       2.2.9. Survey broken or damaged containers to determine the extent of radiological
       hazards and direct recovery actions as necessary.
       2.2.10. Report and investigate each case of suspected or actual overexposure or abnormal
       radiation exposure in accordance with AFI 40-201, AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and
       Reports, and USFKR 385-1 to determine the cause and prevent a recurrence, to include
       determining fetal doses for ionizing radiation and the extent of exposure to the affected
       individuals. Investigate TLD exposures exceeding Investigation Action Levels set below
       (based on the October 2005 Bioenvironmental Engineer’s Guide to Ionizing Radiation,
       Table 8-2 most conservative suggestion due to the normal 0.00 rem exposure to Osan AB
       personnel):

          Equivalent: Annual - 5 rem, Quarterly - 1.3 rem.
          2.2.10.4. Deep Dose and Committed Dose Equivalent for pregnant females:
          Quarterly – 0.025 rem.
       2.2.11. Review and approve/disapprove all requests to bring RAMs or RPDs on base or
       to conduct work involving such materials or equipment.
       2.2.12. Report annually in January the annual inventories of all radioactive materials
       (close out date is 31 December) to USFK RSO, in accordance with USFKR 385-1.
       2.2.13. Report changes in radioactive materials inventory to the USFK RSO within 30
       days of change, in accordance with USFKR 385-1.

Terms
ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable)—is a principle of ionizing radiation protection
mandated by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (10 CFR 20.1003) for its licenses to
make every reasonable effort to maintain radiation exposures as far as below the limits as is
reasonably achievable. In the USAF, ALARA is a set of management and administrative actions
taken to reduce personnel radiation dosage to as low a level as possible consistent with
operational requirements. The ALARA concept was developed in response to scientific
evidence that suggests no level of radiation exposure is totally risk free. While the established
maximum permissible doses are conservative and offer a low risk of adverse health effects
compared to other hazards, every effort should be made to reduce exposures to the lowest
possible.
Generator (waste)—For items controlled under a USAF RAM Permit issued to a specific
organization, the using activity of the permitted organization will be considered the generator.
For commodity type items not covered under a specific USAF RAM Permit, the generator will
be the person or activity with property accountability for the item when it is designated as waste.
Ionizing Radiation—Any radiation capable of displacing electrons from atoms or molecules,
thereby producing ions. Examples include alpha particles, beta particles, gamma rays or x rays,
and cosmic rays.
Radiation Producing Devices (RPDs)—Equipment capable of generating ionizing radiation,
such as an x-ray machine.
Radiation Safety Officer (RSO)—An individual who provides consultation and advice on the
hazards associated with radiation and the effectiveness of measures to control these hazards. An
RSO is also responsible for enforcing compliance with all pertinent standards and regulations for
ionizing radiation sources. There are three categories of RSOs:
Installation RSO—An individual designated by the 51 FW/CC to manage the base IRPP.
Permit RSO—An individual approved by the USAF Radioisotope Committee to manage the
radiation protection aspects associated with the use of radioactive materials for which a specific
USAF RAM Permit has been issued.
Unit RSO—An individual designated by the unit commander to act as a focal point for the unit
on radiation protection matters. Each unit that operates RPDs or uses radioactive materials
appoints a unit RSO.
Radioactive Material (RAM)—Material that contain radioactive isotopes or generate ionizing
radiation.

Thermo—luminescent Dosimeter (TLD)—A passive radiation monitoring device consisting of
a Thermo-luminescent card and holder. The whole body TLD monitors for beta, gamma, and x-
ray exposures.
USAF Radioactive Material Permit (RAM Permit)—A written authorization from the USAF
Radioisotope Committee (RIC) for USAF organizations to receive, possess, distribute, use,
transfer, or dispose of specific radioactive materials.
USAF Radioisotope Committee (RIC)—A committee established to provide USAF
administrative surveillance over all radioactive materials.
