well as AED. NOTE: Section 401.2915, Florida Statutes and Rule 64E-2039, Florida Administrative
Code (F.A.C.), require initial and refresher training on the general use of AEDs, CPR, and on the particu-
lar model of AED available in a facility for all members who will be using the AEDs. Pursuant to F.A.C.
64E-2039, refresher training shall be conducted every 2 years.

2.3. Florida Good Samaritan Act. Allows a reasonable person reacting to a perceived medical emer-
gency without objection of the victim to be immune from civil liability.

2.4. Responders. Responders are individuals who are trained in BCLS for use in a sudden cardiac arrest
emergency. Their specific training shall be set forth in accordance with local policy.

2.5. Automated External Defibrillator (AED). A defibrillator device that is:
   2.5.1. Commercially distributed in accordance with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act
   (FFDCA).
   2.5.2. Capable of recognizing the presence or absence of ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachy-
   cardia, and is capable of determining, without intervention by the user of the device, whether defibril-
   lation should be performed.
   2.5.3. Able to deliver an electrical shock to an individual upon determining that defibrillation should
   be performed.

2.6. Ventricular Fibrillation. An abnormal cardiac rhythm that is incompatible with life if not immedi-
ately treated (hereafter referred to as heart attack).

2.7. Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia. An abnormal cardiac rhythm that is incompatible with life if
not immediately treated (hereafter referred to as heart attack).

2.8. Defibrillation. The application of an electric shock, via a defibrillator, directly to a person’s chest.

2.9. Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA). When the electrical impulses of the human heart malfunction caus-
ing ventricular fibrillation, an erratic and ineffective rhythm, characterized by the absence of a pulse and
respirations.

2.10. Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD). The term used to describe an abrupt cessation of normal cardiac
function that typically results from ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia with rapid
progression to death if not immediately treated.

                                               Chapter 4

                             AED LOCATIONS AND INSTALLATION:

4.1. The Essential Key to Surviving a Heart Attack is Early Defibrillation. AEDs must be strategi-
cally placed throughout each unit/organization based upon the time to initial shock of a victim of SCA,
which should optimally be less than 4 minutes. An initial Hurlburt Field facility site assessment has des-
ignated sites with the highest priority to obtain PADs (Attachment 6).
   4.1.1. Future facility site assessments will be accomplished, as Hurlburt Field needs change, to deter-
   mine the number of AEDs that are necessary, as well as their placement within buildings. The medical
   director will review adequacy of AED placement annually and will be consulted regarding any new
   mission requirements. Facility modifications/AED installation requests must be coordinated on an AF
   Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request, and approved prior to installation if facility is modi-
   fied.
   4.1.2. Factors to consider in determining AED placement include the following:
       4.1.2.1. Facility size.
       4.1.2.2. Number of employees in the facility.
       4.1.2.3. Average age of the facility occupants.
       4.1.2.4. Incidence of heart disease, given the population at hand.
       4.1.2.5. Emergency response protocol may already be in place for a facility; however, optimal
       response time from the identification of a person "down" to the arrival of AED on-scene should be
       4 minutes or less.
       4.1.2.6. In order to achieve complete area coverage within a building, an AED should be posi-
       tioned no more than 1 minute's travel time (one way) from any given point within the building.

4.2. AED Procurement. AEDs must be procured utilizing established Air Force, wing, and unit instruc-
tions and policies. Current policy mandates using organizations or installations must fund the purchase
and upkeep of AEDs and related equipment. The 16 MDG has not been resourced to purchase AEDs:
   4.2.1. Medical items will be purchased with the Government Purchase Card in accordance with AFI
   64-117.
   4.2.2. Units will establish a medical Resource Code/Cost Center (RC/CC) account and Project Fund
   Management Report (PFMR) through the unit’s Resource Advisor.
   4.2.3. AEDs will be shipped to 16 MDSS/SGSL, Medical Logistics Officer, 131 Loop Road.
   4.2.4. Unit RC/CC will be loaded as a supplementary address in the requisition process.
   4.2.5. AEDs will be received, inspected, and accounted for in the Defense Medical Logistics Standard
   Support (DMLSS) utilizing the unit’s RC/CC.
   4.2.6. Unit AED coordinator will be notified once the AED is indexed and accounted for.
   4.2.7. Unit AED coordinators will produce AEDs for inventory every 12 months as directed by the
   Medical Logistics Flight Commander IAW AFI 41-209.

               CRITICAL INCIDENT STRESS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION

A6.1. Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) is a comprehensive system of crisis intervention
designed to assist individuals and groups affected by traumatic events (natural disasters, terrorist events,
suicides, death – either accidental or intentional).

A6.2. Many types of events have the potential to produce individual/community traumatic stress. Events
include large-scale disasters (tornadoes, bombings, hurricanes, etc.) and small-scale disasters (suicide,
death or near-death of coworker, workplace violence event, etc.). CISM services will be provided after
traumatic events to help those who have experienced such events. The goal is to assist those affected by
traumatic events to cope with the normal stress reaction in an effective manner. These actions are intended
to minimize the impact of exposure to these events and prevent or mitigate the disabling effects of a trau-
matic event.

A6.3. The office of record for CISM services is the Behavioral Health Flight (881-4237). Please address
inquiries about CISM services to the Team Chief of the critical incident stress team (CIST).
