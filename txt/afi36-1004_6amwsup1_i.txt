                                                Chapter 1

                                 INCENTIVE AWARDS PROGRAM

1.1. Recognition for Accomplishments. The Air Force Incentive Awards Program provides special
awards for superior accomplishments. Awards under this chapter should not be used to replace perfor-
mance awards.

1.2. Approving Awards. The Secretary of the Air Force (SAF) approves all cash awards under this
instruction for senior executive service (SES) members.
    1.2.1. See Table 2.1. and Table 4.1. for approval levels for all other awards.
    1.2.2. Managers make the decision to grant or refuse an award.

1.3. Delegating Award Approval.
    1.3.1. Establish broad approval authority to allow award approval at the lowest possible level without
    official committee action.
       1.3.1.1. (Added-6AMW) Unless otherwise designated, the Commander, 6th Air Mobility Wing
       (6 AMW/CC), group, and tenant commanders or designees are authorized to approve incentive
       awards for amounts up to $2,500.
    1.3.2. Have the installation incentive award committee review award recommendations over $2,500.
       1.3.2.1. (Added-6AMW) United States Special Operations Command Incentive Awards Com-
       mittee will review award recommendations for employees assigned to that command.

1.4. Air Force Incentive Awards Board (AFIAB). The Air Force Chief of Staff appoints the AFIAB,
which is chaired by a general officer or civilian equivalent. The board may approve, disapprove, or mod-
ify awards.
    1.4.1. The board makes recommendations to SAF to approve:
       1.4.1.1. Air Force Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service
       1.4.1.2. Air Force Civilian Award for Valor
       1.4.1.3. President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service
       1.4.1.4. Non-Federal awards, except those limited to senior executives (SES, SL, and ST)
       (AFI 36-901, Air Force Senior Executive Resources)
    1.4.2. The Board recommends various awards, including The Department of Defense (DoD) Distin-
    guished Civilian Service Award to SAF for submission to the DoD Washington Headquarters Services
    Directorate for Personnel and Services, or other appropriate authorities, including nominations for
    cash awards in excess of $10,000.

1.5. Major Command (MAJCOM) Incentive Awards Committee. Each MAJCOM and comparable
organization that has a civilian personnel division may establish a committee including military and civil-
ian personnel. The decision to use or not use a committee rests with the award approval authority. The
committee:
AFI36-1004_6AMWSUP1_I 14 DECEMBER 2005                                                                    5


   1.5.1. Reviews, approves, or disapproves recommendations for awards.
   1.5.2. Recommends or selects nominees for competitive awards.
   1.5.3. Advises on program improvements.
   1.5.4. Reviews, completes, and provides a recommendation or decision to the MAJCOM commander
   concerning:

       1.5.4.2. Honorary recognition for valor, meritorious, exceptional, or distinguished service
       1.5.4.3. Command nominations to send to AFIAB

1.6. Installation Incentive Awards Committee.
   1.6.1. Installations with a servicing Civilian Personnel Flight (CPF) may establish an incentive
   awards committee. The CPF gives program support and technical assistance. The committee:
       1.6.1.1. Reviews, computes, and recommends to the owning commander approval or disapproval
       of cash award amounts that require committee action or higher level approval.
       1.6.1.2. Recommends honorary awards that need higher level approval and nominations for Fed-
       eral or non-Federal awards.
   1.6.2. Field operating agency (FOA) commanders may use existing installation incentive awards
   committee. The CPF may establish a subcommittee of FOA members.
   1.6.3. Tenant units use the local incentive awards committee that the servicing CPF supports through
   host and tenant servicing agreements.
   1.6.4. (Added-6AMW) The 6 AMW/CC or designee will appoint members to the Wing Incentive
   Awards Committee to review and recommend approval or disapproval of cash award amounts that
   require committee action or higher level approval.

1.7. Presenting and Publicizing Awards. The commander, management official, or supervisor recog-
nizes employees and presents awards at a suitable ceremony. When an Air Force employee receives rec-
ognition outside the Air Force (for example, the DoD Distinguished Civilian Service Award), the Air
Force organization to which the employee belongs makes all arrangements, including protocol, with the
awarding party. Recognize and publicize significant achievements or contributions in the local commu-
nity as well as on base.

1.8. Giving Certificates in Braille. All Air Force award certificates for blind award recipients must
have Braille overlaid lettering as well as standard print. Use local purchase authority to obtain these cer-
tificates.

1.9. Recognizing Local Community or Civic Officials (Non-Federal Employ ees). When local busi-
ness persons and civic officials offer significant services or contributions to the installation and the Air
Force, commanders may recognize these non-Federal persons using AF Form 3033, Certificate of
Appreciation. It is DoD policy to not recognize private citizens or private entities that have a commercial
or profit making relationship with the Department, unless the contribution is substantially beyond that

specified or implied in the terms of the contract establishing the relationship, or the recognition is in the
public interest.

1.10. Incentive Awards Program Annual Report (Civilian), IRCN: 1059-OPM-AN. AFPC/DPS
writes the statistical portion of this report through DCPDS. The report is provided to HQ USAF/DPDF,
1040 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1040, for review and transmittal to the OPM.

1.11. Other Recognition Programs. Air Force employees may receive monetary and honorary awards
from other federal departments and agencies for contributions that benefit those operations. The Air Force
may grant monetary and honorary awards to employees of other federal departments and agencies when
their contributions benefit the Air Force.

1.12. Wearing or Accepting Foreign Awards . An Air Force employee may not accept or wear a deco-
ration from a foreign government without the express consent of Congress. The CPF coordinates foreign
award inquiries for US citizen employees with HQ USAF/DPDF.

                                               Chapter 2

                                   MONETARY INCENTIVE AWARDS

2.1. Purpose and Coverage. The Air Force encourages using monetary incentive awards to increase
productivity and recognize outstanding achievements.
    2.1.1. Monetary incentive awards do not substitute for other personnel actions, pay, or performance
    awards.
    2.1.2. This program applies to SES, SL, ST, GS, and FWS employees.
    2.1.3. It does not apply to:
       2.1.3.1. Non-US citizen employees (except Panama)
       2.1.3.2. Nonappropriated fund (NAF) employees
       2.1.3.3. Administrative law judges
       2.1.3.4. Prevailing rate employees whose pay is set outside the United States
       2.1.3.5. Foreign service employees
       2.1.3.6. Individuals on noncareer executive assignments under 5 CFR Part 305

2.2. Funding. The program needs funds to comply with the spirit of the law and Air Force policy on
civilian productivity and performance. The command, staff, and line managers account for civilian per-
sonnel cost management. Each activity should budget a percentage of its yearly civilian pay budget for
funding awards.

2.3. Special Act or Service Award (SASA). SASA recognizes a GS, ST, or FWS employee or group
contribution for a nonrecurring special achievement.
    2.3.1. SES members are eligible for SASAs and incentive awards, provided they are not used to sup-
    plement or circumvent the regular SES bonus system for recognizing overall performance.
    2.3.2. Grant SASA at any time for special acts or services, including while an employee was on detail
    or other temporary assignment.
    2.3.3. Submit recommendations for SASAs in narrative form immediately after the event. Use AF
    Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet, and AF Form 2860, Special Act or Service Award. AF Form
    1768 must include the recommended award amount and a brief description of the act or service.
       2.3.3.1. (Added-6AMW) Recommendation for a Special Act or Service Award (SASA) up to
       $2,500 will be made by the immediate supervisor/recommending official in accordance with AFI
       36-1004. A proposed citation should be included in the award package. The Quality Control
       Review Monitor (QCRM) will review the package prior to forwarding it to the appropriate
       approving authority. Once approved, a copy of the package will be forwarded to the Civilian Per-
       sonnel Flight (CPF), 6th Mission Support Squadron (6 MSS/DPCE). The supervisor or designee
       creates a Request for Personnel Action (RPA) and forwards it electronically to the budget office,
       6th Comptroller Squadron, Budget Flight (6 CPTS/FMA), who, in turn, will forward the approved
       RPA to the CPF. The CPF will coordinate on the action and forward it to the Air Force Personnel

      Center (AFPC) for production of the SF-50, Notification of Personnel Action, for payment of the
      award.
      2.3.3.2. (Added-6AMW) Recommendation for a SASA over $2,500 will be made by the imme-
      diate supervisor/ recommending official in accordance with AFI 36-1004. A proposed citation
      should be included in the award package. The package is then reviewed by the QCRM. The AF
      IMT 1768, Staff Summary Sheet, must be coordinated with 6 CPTS/FMA and the appropriate
      group or tenant commander or designee prior to forwarding to 6 MSS/DPCE for processing. The
      Wing Incentive Awards Committee reviews and votes on the award. If recommended for approval
      by the committee, the package will be forwarded to the 6 AMW/CC for final approval. Once noti-
      fied of approval, the supervisor or designee will create an RPA and forward it to the CPF. The
      CPF will coordinate on the action and forward it to AFPC for production of the SF-50 for payment
      of the award.
   2.3.4. See Table 2.1. for approval authority. Send original and three copies of recommendations for
   SASAs exceeding $10,000 to HQ USAF/DPDF for AFIAB review.
   2.3.5. Base payment for such awards on tangible or intangible benefits (Table 2.2., Table 2.3. and
   Table 2.4.).

2.4. Notable Achievement Award (NAA). The NAA is a category of SASA for GS, ST, and FWS
employees, based on noteworthy contributions that do not warrant SASA. Use AF Form 1768 and AF
Form 3032, Certificate of Achievement.
   2.4.1. A supervisor at any level in the employee's chain of command may initiate the award. The next
   higher level supervisor gives final approval.
   2.4.2. Award amounts may range from $25-$500. Do not grant the award for a contribution for which
   you gave a previous award.
   2.4.3. Managers outside the employee's chain of command may also nominate an employee for a
   NAA by making recommendations to the employee's immediate supervisor for approval by the
   employee's second-line supervisor. In which case, the nominating organization: Pays the award costs
   and provides the funding information to the employee's organization. NOTE: If the administrative
   cost of transferring funds would exceed the amount of the award, the employing agency shall absorb
   the award costs and pay the award.
   2.4.4. Local procedures may be established for nominating and processing NAAs.
      2.4.4.1. (Added-6AMW) The immediate supervisor will prepare a concise narrative substantia-
      tion on an AF IMT 1768 for a Notable Achievement Award and forward to the QCRM for review.
      The QCRM will review the recommendation for procedural compliance and forward to the second
      level supervisor for final approval/disapproval action. Once the award is approved, the second
      level supervisor will forward a copy of the AF IMT 1768 and justification to 6 MSS/DPCE. The
      supervisor or designee will then create an RPA and forward it electronically to 6 CPTS/FMA who,
      in turn, will forward the approved RPA to the CPF. The CPF will coordinate on the action and for-
      ward it to AFPC for production of the SF-50 for payment of the award.

2.5. Using the Productivity Cash Incentive Program (PCIP). The Air Force encourages activities to
establish unique PCIPs. A PCIP augments job performance awards rather than replacing them. Limit
PCIP to jobs where:

     2.5.1. Tasks are recurring and repetitive
     2.5.2. You can objectively measure performance
     2.5.3. A specific employee or group of employees performs the work
     2.5.4. The employee controls the work pace
NOTE: HQ USAF/DPD must approve each PCIP before implementation. Send PCIP plans and docu-
ments to HQ USAF/DPD, 1040 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1040, at least 120 calendar
days before the desired implementation date.

gible benefits or savings on an estimate of the first-year dollar savings or benefits. If the tangible benefits
or savings in the first year following implementation do not represent benefits to the government, base

                                 TIME-OFF INCENTIVE AWARDS

3.1. Granting Time-Off Awards. Time-off awards grant time off from duty without loss of pay or
charge to leave and are awarded for superior accomplishments that contribute to the quality, efficiency, or
economy of government operations. Time-off awards are an alternate means of recognizing the superior
accomplishments of employees with other than monetary or non-monetary awards. Time-off awards can
be granted for performance as reflected in the employee’s most recent rating of record and can be granted
in lieu of, or in conjunction with, a Performance Award. Decisions to grant time-off awards shall be based
upon the same criteria or circumstances as for other incentive awards (i.e., Special Act or Service Award).
The amount of the time-off that is granted is based upon the value of the individual’s contribution, not
upon the grade or salary of the individual.
   3.1.1. Supervisors may approve time-off awards of no more than 1 working day without review and
   approval of a higher official. Complete all documentation and processing requirements.
   3.1.2. Officials who exercise personnel appointing authority may approve time-off awards in excess
   of 1 working day. They may delegate this authority to officials who approve recommendations for
   other incentive awards. Designate these officials in local written operating guidelines.
       3.1.2.1. (Added-6AMW) Group and tenant commanders and the Director of Staff (6 AMW/DS)
       are delegated the authority to approve or disapprove time-off awards in excess of one working day
       for individuals in their respective organizations. For wing units, time-off awards for the entire
       wing will be approved or disapproved by 6 AMW/CC. Time-off awards for entire squadrons,
       including those for one working day or less, will be approved or disapproved by the Group Com-
       mander under which the squadron is assigned. For entire wing staff organizations/squadrons,
       time-off awards will be approved or disapproved by 6 AMW/DS. Tenant commanders are dele-
       gated this authority in their respective organizations. When submitting large organizational
       groups for approval, an AF IMT 1768 with proper justification, certification, and an alphabetical
       list of the names and social security numbers of the employees receiving the time-off award
       should be prepared and submitted to the CPF. When awards have been approved, the RPA must
       be submitted electronically to the CPF for coordination and forwarding to AFPC for processing.

3.2. Eligibility. Grant a time-off award to any federal employee who meets the definition at 5 U.S.C.
2105, including SES employees and direct-hire foreign national employees (FNE). Indirect-hire FNEs are
eligible for these awards only if an incentive awards program established by agreement with the host
country includes such a provision.
   3.2.1. Civilian Team Incentive Award: Supervisors may grant a time-off award to individual employ-
   ees who comprise a team whose joint achievement(s) contributed to meeting organizational goals or
   improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and economy of the Government. Justification for a team
   award given for the same accomplishment should document the team nature of the achievement and
   why all members of the team deserve to share equally in the recognition.

3.3. Time-Off Award Limits:
   3.3.1. Full-time employees, may be awarded a total time-off of 80 hours during any leave year. The
   maximum amount of time-off that can be approved for any single contribution is 40 hours.
14                                                   AFI36-1004_6AMWSUP1_I 14 DECEMBER 2005


     3.3.2. For part-time employees or employees with an uncommon tour of duty, officials may grant dur-
     ing any leave year an amount of time equal to the average number of work hours in the employee's
     biweekly scheduled tour of duty. Maximum award for any single contribution is one-half the maxi-
     mum amount of time that can be granted during the year.
     3.3.3. Schedule awarded time-off within 90 calendar days after the effective date of the award.
     Employees forfeit any time-off not used within 1 year from the effective date.
     3.3.4. Schedule time-off to avoid adversely affecting an employee who has an annual leave "use or
     lose" situation. Awarded time-off cannot be used to justify restoring forfeited annual leave.
     3.3.5. Employees may never convert a time-off award to a cash payment.
     3.3.6. Employees may not transfer approved unused time-off when they transfer from the Air Force
     to another DoD component or to another federal agency, nor may employees coming from another
     department or federal agency transfer time-off to the Air Force.
     3.3.7. Time-off awards shall not be granted to create the effect of a holiday or treated as administra-
     tive excusals or leave, e.g., they shall not be granted in conjunction with a military “down” or “train-
     ing” day or the like which would grant the entire civilian employee population, or a majority of the
     civilian population, a time-off award to be used on a specified day.

3.4. Documenting Time-off. Support any time-off award with appropriate written justification. Submit
approved time-off awards to the CPF for processing. Include the employee's name, social security num-
ber, organization, and number of hours of time-off granted.
     3.4.1. Justify time-off by explaining how the employee merits the award. Include certification from
     the supervisor or recommending official as shown below:
"I have considered fully the wage costs and productivity loss in granting this time-off award. The amount
of time-off granted is commensurate with the individual’s contribution or accomplishment. I also consid-
ered the unit's workload and unit employees’ leave projections and certify that the employee can schedule
the time-off in addition to other scheduled leave. I also considered other available forms of recognition in
determining the amount of this time-off award."
     3.4.2. Include the approving official's name, position title, signature, and date signed, as well as those
     of the recommending official, as appropriate.
     3.4.3. Document the approved time-off award on a Standard Form 50 (SF 50), Notice of Personnel
     Action. Keep the form in the employee's OPF. File award justification in the employee performance
     file (EPF). Prepare separate SF 50 for each approved award.
     3.4.4. Document the effective date on the SF 50 after appropriate review and verification of legal
     requirements by an approving official.

3.5. Recording Scheduled Time-Off.
     3.5.1. Record the employee's use of time-off on the employee's time and attendance reports according
     to instructions published by the civilian payroll function.
     3.5.2. The employee must get supervisory approval to schedule and use the time-off award.
     Employee requests time-off far enough in advance to use it without disrupting the unit's work.

  3.5.3. Supervisors who want to schedule an employee's time-off before receiving the SF-50 may
  check with the servicing CPF to verify that regulatory requirements were met.

                                 HONORARY INCENTIVE AWARDS

4.1. General Information. Use honorary incentive awards alone or in addition to monetary awards to
acknowledge significant contributions. The honorary awards in this chapter serve as incentives to
employees with continuous federal service. Except for the Outstanding Civilian Career Service Award
and the valor awards, do not nominate employees who are about to retire.

4.2. Eligibility for Multiple Federal Awards. You may recommend an employee for the DoD Distin-
guished Civilian Service Award or the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service to
recognize the same act or achievement for which the Air Force previously granted an award.

4.3. Eligibility for More Than One Air Force Award. You may give an honorary Air Force award to
recognize a contribution for which the Air Force previously awarded a cash award. RESTRICTIONS:
     4.3.1. Give only one Air Force honorary award for a single act, achievement, or period of service.
     4.3.2. Do not give an honorary award to recognize an act or achievement for which military recogni-
     tion was previously given.
EXCEPTION: The Air Force Outstanding Civilian Career Service Award is exempt from these restric-
tions since it recognizes long-term service that may include one or more honorary awards.

4.4. Processing Honorary Awards. Since honorary awards require considerable review and delibera-
tion, avoid short-notice processing. Submit honorary award nominations for presentation at a special cer-
emony at least 3 months before the scheduled event.
     4.4.1. Local incentive awards procedures must be established to review and make recommendations
     on all awards that must be forwarded to higher headquarters for approval.
        4.4.1.1. (Added-6AMW) Recommendations for awards requiring higher headquarters approval
        will be made by the immediate supervisor/recommending official in accordance with AFI
        36-1004, Table 4.1. A proposed citation should be included in the award package. The QCRM
        will review the package, ensuring that the AF IMT 1768 has an area for coordination by the appro-
        priate group or tenant commander or designee prior to submitting to 6 MSS/DPCE. Once received
        in 6 MSS/DPCE, the Wing Incentive Awards Committee will review and recommend approval/
        disapproval. The package will then be forwarded to the appropriate approval level.
     4.4.2. Awards approved by SAF or higher authority go through local incentive award channels and
     the parent MAJCOM or comparable organization to HQ USAF/DPDF, 1040 Air Force Pentagon,
     Washington DC 20330-1040, ATTENTION: Executive Secretary, Air Force Incentive Awards Board.
     The board sends approved recommendations to SAF.

4.5. Air Force Honorary Awards. Air Force honorary awards are outlined in Table 4.1.

4.6. Non-Air Force or Non-Federal Honorary Awards. Table 4.2. lists various non-Air Force or
non-Federal awards and criteria for Air Force participation.
AFI36-1004_6AMWSUP1_I 14 DECEMBER 2005                                                                       17


4.7. Nomination Deadlines. Commanders at each echelon should participate in any locally sponsored
honorary award programs that recognize performance or service of Air Force employees. Tentative sus-
pense dates set by sponsors of the various awards will be published annually by HQ USAF/DPDF (award
solicitation schedule). HQ USAF/DPDF will identify awards that are mailed directly to the award sponsor
(e.g., National Public Service Awards). Suspense dates for awards that must be mailed to HQ USAF/
DPDF for AFIAB review prior to submission to the award sponsor will also be provided in the award
solicitation schedule to allow sufficient processing time (e.g., Arthur S. Flemming Award). Because spon-
sor solicitations for award nominations frequently arrive with short notice, use the HQ USAF/DPDF
award solicitation schedule to request nominations 60-90 days before suspense date. HQ USAF/DPDF
will announce any major suspense date changes in writing to MAJCOMs and FOAs.

4.8. Awarding Letters and Certificates of Commendation. Use AF Form 3034, Certificate of Com-
mendation, with a letter of commendation to recognize an employee for an unusual achievement or con-
tribution that does not meet the criteria for other awards. Such situations include: Noteworthy
accomplishments while on special assignment or during short periods when an unusual work situation or
emergency exists; Air Force programs recognized by an outside organization to which the employee made
a contribution that was significant; and exceptional participation in civic or professional activities related
to official employment.
   4.8.1. Letters of commendation must contain a complete and concise description of the employee's
   act, accomplishment, or service and identify position title, organization, and dates. Commanders (unit
   level and above) may sign certificates of commendation.
   4.8.2. Supervisors give certificates and letters of commendation to employees. The supervisor anno-
   tates the employee's AF Form 971, Supervisor's Employee Brief, with reference to the letter or cer-
   tificate, and they are filed in the employee's EPF.

4.9. Letters and Certificates of Appreciation. AF Form 3033, Certificate of Appreciation, is an
all-purpose certificate that you can use to recognize individuals for a variety of accomplishments that do
not fall under the performance awards category.
   4.9.1. You may use letters or certificates of appreciation at any time to express appreciation to an
   employee for an above-average act or service.
   4.9.2. You may use the letter or certificate to recognize employee contributions to civic or profes-
   sional activities normally expected in the performance of the job, such as speaking, participating in
   conferences, or other leadership activities.
   4.9.3. The employee's immediate supervisor, higher-level supervisor, or any person having knowl-
   edge of the service may sign the letter or certificate. The supervisor gives the letter or certificate to the
   employee.
   4.9.4. Record and file a copy of the certificate or letter of appreciation with the employee's AF Form
   971. Do not file a copy in the OPF or EPF.

4.10. Other Air Force Recognition. Civilian employees are eligible for other types of recognition
according to the governing regulation or instruction. NOTE: The Air Force Outstanding Unit Award
(AFOUA) and Air Force Organizational Excellence Award (AFOEA) are not documented in the OPF or
18                                                   AFI36-1004_6AMWSUP1_I 14 DECEMBER 2005


DCPDS. Appropriate lapel buttons are used exclusively to recognize Air Force civilians assigned or
attached to units awarded the AFOUA or AFOEA who contributed to the achievements of a cited unit.

4.11. Special Command Trophies and Awards. The Air Force encourages MAJCOMs and comparable
organizations to establish unique honorary awards to recognize superior accomplishments. Likewise, the
establishment of local quarterly/annual awards programs is encouraged. In such event, these programs
should conform to guidance cited in 4.11.2.
     4.11.1. Obtain approval from HQ USAF/DPD before presenting a special command trophy or award
     to a nationally prominent person serving as an expert or consultant. Include the following in the
     approval request: Name of the person, copy of the awards committee minutes, and other supporting
     data. Send to HQ USAF/DPD at least 60 calendar days before the presentation ceremony.
     4.11.2. You may present nonmonetary awards and define such items as a medal, certificate, plaque,
     citation, badge, or other similar items as having award or honor connotation. You may give other
     items with the command or organization logo, such as belt buckles and jackets, but such items must be
     valued less than $50.

4.12. Recognizing Length of Service. Management presents certificates and lapel buttons to recognize
10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 years of creditable federal service if at least 5 years were spent in civilian service.
     4.12.1. Creditable federal service includes both civilian service and all honorable military service
     creditable for leave. Normally, federal service as a military member that led to formal military retire-
     ment is considered appropriately recognized at the time of that retirement. However, an employee
     who wants recognition for combined civilian and military service may request it from the CPF.
     4.12.2. Obtain these signatures for the certificates:
        4.12.2.1. AF Form 3589, 10 Year Length of Service Certificate--Division chief or comparable
        level (unless the employee works for higher level)
        4.12.2.2. AF Form 3590, 20 Year Length of Service Certificate--Director in departmental ser-
        vice (unless the employee works for higher level)
        4.12.2.3. AF Form 3591, 30 Year Length of Service Certificate--Deputy chief of staff, installa-
        tion commander or designated representative
        4.12.2.4. AF Form 3592, 40 Year Length of Service Certificate--MAJCOM commander.
        4.12.2.5. AF Form 3593, 50 Year Length of Service Certificate--SAF (NOTE: For 50-year rec-
        ognition, HQ USAF/DPDF identifies potential recipients, obtains eligibility verification from the
        MAJCOMs and processes certificates to SAF for signature.

4.13. Certificate of Retirement and Retiree Pin. AF Form 342, Retirement Certificate of Civilian
Service, and the retiree lapel pin (Stock # NSN 8455-01-345-2768) are available if desired.

In recognition of his outstanding bravery while performing duties as Tractor Trailer and Fuel Systems
 Distribution Operator, Air Space Logistics Center, Air Force Space Command, 15 September 1993.
 When a vehicle crashed into a fuel stand in the storage area spreading burning fuel over a wide area,

16 SEPTEMBER 2004
SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
OPR: HQ AFPC/DPFFOH (Sheri Fletcher)
Supersedes: AFI 36-1004, 8 Feb 2001
Certified by: HQ AFPC/DPS
This change incorporates interim change (IC) 2004-1 which allows the creation of a Civilian Team Incen-
tive Award (paragraph 3.2.1.).
3.2.1 Civilian Team Incentive Award: Supervisors may grant a time-off award to individual employees
who comprise a team whose joint achievement(s) contributed to meeting organizational goals or improv-
ing the efficiency, effectiveness, and economy of the Government. Justification for a team award given for
the same accomplishment should document the team nature of the achievement and why all members of
the team deserve to share equally in the recognition.
