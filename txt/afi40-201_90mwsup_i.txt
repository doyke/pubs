                                            Chapter 1

                                       INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose. This instruction provides uniform policy, instruction, and guidance for the
management and control of RAM in the USAF world-wide. It sets forth how USAF personnel or
units manage (to include acquire, receive, use, store, transfer, transport, distribute, and dispose
of) all RAM not expressly excluded from the purview of this AFI. This instruction also
prescribes how non-USAF entities get approval to use RAM on USAF installations.
1.2. Applicability. RAM covered by this instruction includes, without limitation, byproduct,
source, SNM, and naturally occurring or accelerator produced RAM. This instruction does not
apply to nuclear reactor programs, nuclear weapon systems and fuel, and other material
controlled under Section 91(a) or 91(b) of the AEA unless such are not covered by AFI 91-101
or any other instruction managed by AFSC. The handling of waste from operations involving
nuclear munitions maintenance is discussed in context with AFI 91-108.
1.3. Objectives. The objectives of this instruction are to:
     1.3.1. Ensure the proper acquisition, possession, storage, use, transfer, disposal and
     transportation of RAM covered by this instruction.
     1.3.2. Establish a unified approach to the management and safeguarding of RAM used by the
     USAF or contractors working on USAF installations world-wide.
     1.3.3. Implement a unified policy for authorizing the acquisition, possession, storage, use,
     transfer, disposal and transportation of RAM world-wide.
1.4. Regulatory Authority for Radioactive Materials. This instruction implements NRC
requirements across the USAF. It also sets requirements for USAF-owned RAM not under the
jurisdiction of the NRC. The NRC is the primary regulatory authority for the USAF use of RAM
in the United States. In locations outside of the United States and its territories, USAF units will
comply with this instruction where practicable, or host nation requirements, if required by an
applicable international agreement.
1.5. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Regulatory Authority. The AEA of 1954, as
amended (including the Energy Policy Act of 2005), and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974
(Public Law 93-438) grant the NRC the authority to regulate byproduct, Naturally Occurring or
Accelerator Produced Radioactive Material (NARM), accelerator, source, and SNM, 42 U.S.C. §
2011 et seq. This authority does not extend to material described in Sections 91(a) and 91(b) of
the 1954 Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2121(a) – (b).
     1.5.1. NRC authority extends across the United States, its possessions and territories, and
     Puerto Rico. For regulations issued and enforced by the NRC, reference Title 10, Code of
     Federal Regulations (CFR), Chapter 1, Parts 1 through 199.
     1.5.2. The NRC maintains regulatory authority over Federal agency licensees regardless of
     location within the United States.
1.6. USAF Regulatory Authority.

   1.6.1. Authority for USAF receipt, storage, internal distribution, use, transfer, and disposal
   of byproduct, source, and limited quantities of SNM is granted through the USAF Master
   Materials License (MML) issued to the USAF by the NRC. This instruction prescribes
   requirements for USAF compliance with the MML and other regulatory requirements.
   1.6.2. Authority for USAF production, receipt, storage, distribution, use, transfer, and
   disposal by USAF organizations of NARM is also covered under this instruction, IAW
   Energy Policy Act of 2005 that expanded the NRC jurisdiction to include NARM.
   1.6.3. The USAF also maintains authority over the use of RAM by non-USAF organizations
   on USAF installations where exclusive Federal jurisdiction exists. Exception: Tenant
   organizations operating under a non-USAF permit are not subject to the conditions of this
   instruction. These tenant organizations should inform the IRSO of materials authorized on
   their license/permit. Tenant organizations are not subject to AFIA/SG inspections.
   1.6.4. Authority for USAF receipt, use, storage, distribution and disposal of 91(a) and 91(b)
   material is covered under AFI 91-108 and AFI 91-110, Nuclear Safety Review and Launch
   Approval for Space or Missile Use of Radioactive Material and Nuclear Systems.
   1.6.5. USAF activities outside the United States follow applicable laws and regulations of
   the host country concerning import, export, control, and disposal of RAM according to the
   Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), or similar document, with the host country. Radiation
   safety standards and requirements followed by USAF organizations will be at least as
   stringent as those within the United States. USAF installations located within the host nation
   will honor contractor host nation licenses for using RAM in like manner as a NRC or
   Agreement State License.
1.7. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). RCRA authorizes the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop and enforce regulations governing the
cradle to grave management of hazardous waste. These regulations are found in Title 40, Code
of Federal Regulations. For purposes of RCRA take note of the following definitions: Low-
Level Mixed Waste (LLMW) is waste that contains both low-level radioactive waste and RCRA
hazardous waste. Low-Level Radioactive Waste (LLW) is a radioactive waste which contains
source, special nuclear, or byproduct material and is not classified as high-level radioactive
waste, transuranic waste, spent nuclear fuel, or byproduct material. Mixed Waste (MW) means
waste that contains both RCRA hazardous waste and source, special nuclear, or byproduct
material. As such, MW is subject to dual regulation under EPA and NRC rules. However, 40
CFR Part 266, subpart N (Part(s) 266.210 – 266.310) provides for conditional exemption from
RCRA coverage for LLMW storage, treatment, transportation and disposal so long as the
LLMW meets the subpart N requirements.
   1.7.1. Solid low level radioactive waste (LLRW) includes quantities of byproduct, source
   and SNM. They also may contain NARM, and they too may fall within the definition of
   hazardous waste as set out in Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1,
   Environmental Protection Agency, Part 261, Identification and Listing of Hazardous Waste
   (40 CFR part 261).
   1.7.2. Waste that contains both AEA-regulated RAM and hazardous waste (as defined by 40
   CFR 261.3) is termed mixed waste (See 1.7 and 40 CFR Part 266.210).
       1.7.2.1. The NRC regulates the byproduct, source, and SNM constituents.
 8                                                   AFI40-201_90MWSUP_I 30 APRIL 2013


        1.7.2.2. EPA regulates the hazardous chemical and non-NRC regulated constituents.
        1.7.2.3. Neither agency has exclusive jurisdiction over mixed waste under current
        Federal law.
        1.7.2.4. Generators of mixed waste must meet both NRC and EPA regulations unless
        exempted by those regulations. Refer to 40 CFR 261 and 266, subpart N, AFPD 32-70,
        Environmental Quality; AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program
        Planning and Operations; AFI 32-7020, The Environmental Restoration Program, AFI
        32-7042, Waste Management; AFPD 48-1, Aerospace Medicine, and AFPD 32-70,
        Environmental Quality, for guidance on compliance with EPA hazardous materials
        regulations.
1.8. Clean Air Act (CAA). The CAA gives the EPA authority over non-NRC regulated
radionuclide emissions from Federal facilities. For applicable regulations, reference 40 CFR 61,
Subpart I, National Emission Standards for Radionuclide Emissions From Facilities Licensed by
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Federal Facilities Not Covered by Subpart H. NRC
regulates air emissions from NRC licensed Federal facilities IAW 10 CFR 20.1101(d).
Organizations that generate emissions must comply with both NRC and EPA rules. For
guidance on complying with EPA air emission standards, refer to AFPD 32-70, Environmental
Quality, and AFI 32-7040, Air Quality Compliance.
1.9. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
(CERCLA). Section 103 of CERCLA requires notification of the National Response Center
immediately at 1-800-424-8802 in the event a release of greater than the “reportable quantity” of
a hazardous substance is released to the environment. A list of applicable reportable quantities
for radionuclides can be found in 40 CFR 302.4, Appendix B-Radionuclides.
1.10. Emergency Planning and Community-Right-To-Know-Act (EPCRA). EPCRA
requires that whenever a “reportable quantity” of a CERCLA hazardous substance leaves
installation boundaries, the State Emergency Response Commission and Local Emergency
Planning Commission must be notified immediately (reference 40 CFR 355, Emergency
Planning and Notification). Note that EPCRA is not, by its terms, applicable to Federal
facilities. The USAF complies with EPCRA, as directed by Executive Order 13148 (April 26,
2000).
1.11. Transportation of Hazardous Material. Department of Transportation (DOT)
regulations, 49 CFR, Transportation, specify requirements for marking, labeling, shipping
documents, containers, and other requirements when shipping or transporting hazardous
materials, including RAM. 49 CFR 172, Hazardous Materials Table, Special Provisions,
Hazardous Materials, Communications, Emergency Response, and Training Requirements, and
49 CFR 173, Shippers – General Requirements for Shipments and Packaging, and DTR DOD
4500.9-R-Part II, Chapter 204.
1.12. Radioactive Material Categories. This instruction stipulates that all RAM (with the
exception of 91(a) and 91(b) material) will be regulated using the policies and procedures in this
instruction and in the MML as identified in paragraph 1.6.
     1.12.1. Specifically Licensed RAM. Many activities with RAM require a specific license
     with the NRC whereby detailed information is provided on the activity, RAM involved,
     organization, responsible radiation safety officer, etc. In a similar manner, the USAF issues
AFI40-201_90MWSUP_I 30 APRIL 2013                                                              9


   specific permits for these activities accomplished with NRC-licensed materials within the
   USAF. Most USAF permits are template types, those issued for devices or applications that
   pose little radiological risk and employ standardized permit conditions. USAF non-template
   permits are for activities or applications that pose much higher radiological risks.
   1.12.2. Generally Licensed Devices (GLDs) containing RAM. The Code of Federal
   Regulations provides a general license for the use of RAM contained in certain products.
   This allows persons to receive and use devices containing these radioactive materials if the
   device has been manufactured and distributed IAW a specific license issued by the NRC or
   by an Agreement State. Most GLDs possessed by USAF units/organizations do not require
   permits, though the USAF does permit some GLDs, as described in this instruction. If a
   permit is not required by the USAF for a particular device, this instruction lists other
   requirements for the possessing unit/organization, the most important of which is the need to
   enter GLDs in the Radioactive Materials Management Information System (RAMMIS).
   1.12.3. Exempted RAM. Certain concentrations or quantities of RAM are exempt from
   specific and general licensing requirements of the NRC. USAF units/organizations have
   restrictions on the disposition of exempt quantities of RAM, as detailed in this instruction,
   and 10 CFR 30.70, Schedule A, or 30.71, Schedule B.
1.13. USAF Acceptance, Transfer, Storage, or Use of Radioactive Materials. USAF units
shall accept, transfer, store or use RAM IAW this instruction.
1.14. Non-USAF Organizations Using RAM on USAF Installations. Non-USAF
organizations on USAF, or USAF-led joint, installations shall accept, transfer, store, or use RAM
IAW this instruction. Exception: Tenant organizations operating under a non-USAF permit are
not subject to the conditions of this instruction. These tenant organizations should inform the
IRSO of materials authorized on their license/permit. Tenant organizations are not subject to
AFIA/SG inspections.

     material is generally licensed and USAF organizations obtaining source material under
     10 CFR 40.22 are not exempt from the requirements of 10 CFR Parts 19, 20, and 21 since
     the USAF possesses source material under a specific license (reference 10 CFR
     40.22(b)).
     3.3.2.4. GLDs, when managed according to 10 CFR 31.3, 31.5, 31.7, 31.10, or 31.11.

     Attachment 3. Note: Devices requiring registration under 10 CFR 31.5(c)(13),
     containing at least 10 mCi of Cesium-137, 0.10 mCi of Strontium-90, 1.0 mCi of Cobalt-
     60, or 1.0 mCi of Americium-241, shall be specifically permitted.
     3.3.2.4. (90MW) Normally, a general license is issued upon receipt of the device. The
     license is typically provided by the device manufacturer or in the case of device transfer,
     by the prior owner. If a device is labeled as generally licensed, but a license document is
     not available, it can be obtained by contacting the manufacturer. This license will outline
     leak test and surveillance requirements for the item. In addition to testing requirements,
     the owning organization must maintain an inventory of all items, verify the inventory
     annually, provide a copy of the inventory to the IRSO annually, and notify the IRSO
     before items are received, transferred or disposed of.

   3.3.3. Non-USAF organizations, except DOE organizations and DOE prime contractors,
   transferring or using RAM on USAF installations in areas of exclusive Federal jurisdiction
   must have an NRC or Agreement State license with a current NRC Form 241 authorizing
   transfer and use on the installation and written approval from the installation commander’s
   appointed approval authority, normally the IRSO.
   3.3.4. DOE organizations and DOE prime contractors must certify, in writing, that they are
   exempt from NRC licensing requirements.
   3.3.5. (Added-90MW) All questions regarding categorization are to be directed to the
   IRSO. Regardless of category, any AF organization located on FEWAFB possessing RAM
   must have a URSO appointed in writing by the unit commander, including museum.
3.4. Requesting Permits, Amendments, and Other Authorizations for RAM Use.
   3.4.1. There are two types of USAF RAM permits: Template and Non-Template.
      3.4.1.1. Template permits are issued for devices or applications that pose relatively little
      radiological risk and employ standardized permit conditions (reference paragraph
      A3.3.1 for examples).
      3.4.1.2. Non-Template permits are issued to organizations that involve significant
      amounts of sealed or unsealed RAM and pose greater than minimal radiological risk.
      These permits mandate detailed radiation protection programs and terms and conditions
      for use. Examples include nuclear medicine clinics, radioactive waste sites, research
      laboratories or other unique applications where standard permit conditions are not
      appropriate.
   3.4.2. Initial applications for permits are prepared and submitted IAW Attachment 4.
   Contact the RICS if an immediate mission critical permit or amendment is required and
   cannot be handled IAW Attachment 5 due to time constraints.
      3.4.2.1. For NRC forms, regulatory guides, and guidance on the administrative aspects of
      permits, contact the RICS. Regulatory guides are also available through the Nuclear
      Regulatory Commission at http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/.
      3.4.2.2. Applications require the signature of the Permittee and appointment of a PRSO
      and, if possible, an alternate PRSO. The Permittee is generally the Commander, or
      civilian equivalent, responsible for the organization. Refer to paragraph 2.28 and
      Attachment 5 for PRSO requirements.
      3.4.2.3. Organizations planning new or unique applications of RAM must contact the
      RICS as early as possible to decide the scope of the permit and the need for a site visit by
      the permit action officer.
      3.4.2.4. Plans for new facilities must be approved by the RICS prior to construction in
      which either large quantities of sealed radioactive sources (see Attachment 8 for
      threshold values) or unsealed RAM will be used. Plans must include provisions for
      baseline surveys prior to initially storing RAM in a location. Increased controls shall be
      in place and inspected by AFIA/SG before the permit will be issued.
      3.4.2.5. Applications for activities expected to have a significant environmental impact
      shall be evaluated IAW 32 CFR 989. Construction of a facility or site at which the
AFI40-201_90MWSUP_I 30 APRIL 2013                                                            35


     activity will be conducted shall not begin until the environmental impact report has been
     submitted with the permit application, and found acceptable, pursuant to subpart A of 10
     CFR 51.
     3.4.2.6. Pursuant to 10 CFR 30.35, 40.36 or 70.25, certain applications require a
     proposed decommissioning funding plan and/or a certification of financial assurance for
     decommissioning. The RICS should be contacted prior to non-template permit
     application submission on the need for these plans.
     3.4.2.7. Each application to possess RAM in unsealed form, on foils or plated sources, or
     sealed in glass in excess of the quantities in 10 CFR 30.72, Schedule C – Quantities of
     Radioactive Material Requiring Consideration of the Need for an Emergency Plan,
     requires either a dose assessment or an emergency plan pursuant to 10 CFR 30.32(i)(1)-
     (3). The RICS should be contacted to coordinate development of these materials.
     3.4.2.8. Applicants desiring to ship, transfer or transport RAM greater than a Type A
     quantity (reference 10 CFR 71, Appendix A, Determination of A1 and A2) must have an
     NRC approved transportation quality assurance (QA) program IAW 10 CFR 71, Subpart
     H; this can be accomplished by:
         3.4.2.8.1. Submitting an application to the RICS following guidelines in 10 CFR 71,
         Subpart G, Subpart H; and NRC Regulatory Guide 7.10. Note: Contact the RICS for
         guidance if not using a commercial NRC approved package.
         3.4.2.8.2. Alternately, utilizing a source vendor or other NRC or Agreement State
         licensee with a NRC approved transportation QA program. Note: Ensure that the
         contractor has jurisdictional authority to perform desired work. Contact the RICS for
         guidance.
         3.4.2.8.3. Applicants desiring to ship or transport RAM greater than 100 times the
         values listed in Table A8.2 of this instruction must also implement additional security
         measures. Note: Contact the RICS for guidance, if needed, at least six months prior
         to shipping date.
  3.4.3. Renewal Permit Applications:
     3.4.3.1. USAF RAM Permits are issued with expiration dates. Renewal applications for
     both types of permits are prepared and submitted IAW Attachment 4.
         3.4.3.1.1. Renewal applications for non-template permits must be submitted at least
         three (3) months, but not greater than six (6) months, prior to the expiration date to
         allow time for the application to be reviewed and the new permit issued in a timely
         manner.
         3.4.3.1.2. Renewal applications for template permits must be submitted at least one
         (1) month, but not greater than three (3) months, prior to the set expiration date to
         allow time for the application to be reviewed and the new permit issued in a timely
         manner.
         3.4.3.1.3. The existing permit will continue in full force and effect beyond the
         expiration date, provided the renewal application was submitted in a timely manner
         prior to the expiration date, and a “Deemed Timely Filed” memorandum has been
         received from the RICS, or AFSC/SEW as appropriate. Failure to renew the permit

   written notification to the IRSO of the final planned disposition. Notification must include
   the radioisotope, activity, quantity and name of individual receiving the RAM. For
   specifically licensed items, the IRSO will need a copy of the current license for both the
   gaining and losing units. The IRSO is available to assist with RAM transfer and coordinate
   proper disposal procedures.
   3.8.5. (Added-90MW) Only personnel authorized by the IRSO will open or package
   containers of RAM.
   3.8.6. (Added-90MW) All RAM which is covered by a license or permit must be accounted
   for by a RAM transfer receipt, which is separate from any contractual, security, or other
   receipt documents.
   3.8.7. (Added-90MW) When RAM is received at, or shipped from FEWAFB, the receiving
   or shipping PRSO must contact the IRSO.
   3.8.8. (Added-90MW) All RAM must be monitored upon receipt and prior to shipment.
   For Wing and tenant agencies, the IRSO will arrange for this monitoring. If the receiving or
 42                                                 AFI40-201_90MWSUP_I 30 APRIL 2013

3.9. Managing and Remediating Radioactive Waste Sites.
   3.9.1. Manage and remediate radioactive waste sites according to AFI 32-7020 and policies
   established by USAF/A4/7 and Attachment 9 of this instruction.
   3.9.2. Radioactive waste site remediation is a complex multi-phase, multi-agency process
   that is subject to NUREG-1575. Attachment 9 outlines the major responsibilities for each
   agency and provides a chronological sequence of events that should be followed in order to
   ensure regulatory compliance.
   3.9.3. USAF organizations are not authorized to possess radioactive investigation derived
   waste or radioactive remediation waste unless authorized by a specific permit.
   3.9.4. All suspected radioactive waste sites must be entered into the AF Radioactive Waste
   Site Registry, maintained by AF/A7CAN. The registry is a database of all formerly known
   and/or potentially radioactive waste sites. For reasons of posterity, privatization of land,
   occupational health, public health and public relations, it is imperative that the USAF
   maintain a master log of these sites.
   3.9.5. Any USAF organization, or agency acting on behalf of the USAF, performing
   intrusive characterization or site remediation involving RAM must have:
      3.9.5.1. An NRC or Agreement State RAM license that authorizes site remediation
      activities, or
      3.9.5.2. A USAF or USN RAM permit that authorizes site remediation activities; and
      3.9.5.3. Experience with site remediation.
   3.9.6. Installations may undertake invasive characterization only if they intend to remediate
   the site. If this is the case, approval of the RICS or AFSC/SEW, as appropriate, is also
   required.
      3.9.6.1. Remediating a site generates radioactive waste that must be controlled and
      properly disposed of IAW current AFRRAD guidance. Remediating a site may also
      release waste in quantities that dictate a prompt total exhumation.
AFI40-201_90MWSUP_I 30 APRIL 2013                                                             43


      3.9.6.2. Prior to instigating intrusive investigation contracts, the installation should
      perform a complete historical site assessment.
   3.9.7. Work and health and safety plans for remediation of radioactive waste sites, to include
   waste disposal procedures, must be coordinated IAW Attachment 9 of this instruction. If,
   during the course of remediation, a site is found to contain RAM which was not anticipated,
   then work must be temporarily ceased and the IRSO must immediately notify the RICS or
   AFSC/SEW as appropriate, to determine requirements for continuation of field activities.
      3.9.7.1. All plans will be submitted to USAFSAM and the AFRRAD office for approval
      during the project planning stage.
      3.9.7.2. Plans for sites containing or suspected to contain only 91(a) or 91(b) materials
      shall be submitted to the Weapons Safety Division of the AFSC/SEW.
      3.9.7.3. Plans for all other sites shall be submitted to the RICS for review. Those sites
      containing or potentially containing byproduct, source, NARM, and SNM will be
      forwarded by the RICS to the NRC for their review.
   3.9.8. Final reports of remediation of all sites containing RAM shall be sent to the RICS or
   AFSC/SEW, as appropriate, for archival purposes. The AFRRAD office will maintain and
   archive all disposal records and manifests for radioactive waste generated from a
   remediation.
3.10. Managing and Disposal of Radioactive Materials.
   3.10.1. IRSO and PRSOs jointly prepare requirements for waste management, according to
   Attachment 10, by considering local conditions such as quantities and types of waste
   produced, where waste is generated, and the location and configuration of available storage.
      3.10.1.1. The base Civil Engineer provides environmental consultation to generating
      units, the IRSO, and the AFRRAD office on the RCRA hazardous waste requirements of
      91(b) mixed waste as related to the proper identification, handling, segregation, and
      storage of such waste.
      3.10.1.2. The base Civil Engineer oversees compliance with installation RCRA permits,
      if applicable, and/or RCRA requirements for storage, treatment, and disposal of mixed
      waste IAW Federal, state, and local requirements, AFI 32-7042, and in coordination with
      the IRSO and the AFRRAD office.
      3.10.1.3. Installation generators will coordinate the disposal of radioactive waste and
      mixed waste with the base Civil Engineer and the IRSO, who will in turn, coordinate
      with the AFRRAD office.
   3.10.2. A USAF RAM permit is required for all radioactive waste storage areas used for
   permitted or licensed quantities of NRC regulated waste.
      3.10.2.1. Radioactive waste storage from more than one permit at a single location or
      otherwise co-mingling radioactive waste from more than one permit is prohibited unless
      specifically authorized by the RICS or AFSC/SEW, as appropriate. Mixed waste from
      nuclear munitions maintenance shall not be commingled or stored with waste from a
      permit issued by the RICS unless approved by the RICS and AFSC/SEW.

  3.10.4. Permittees shall also comply with all other applicable Federal, state, and local
  regulations and instructions regulating all hazardous and mixed waste at the site. Coordinate
  with the base Civil Engineer to determine local requirements for managing and staging
  mixed waste.
  3.10.5. Radioactive waste shall be disposed of as soon as practical. Under no condition shall
  mixed waste be staged for longer than 90 calendar days unless a RCRA permit authorizing
  storage for a longer period has been secured through the base Civil Engineer. Do not collect
  or store radioactive waste for a period longer than 365 days. Coordinate promptly with the
  AFRRAD office via the PRSO and IRSO.
  3.10.6. Dispose of RAM using one of the following methods:
     3.10.6.1. Transfer to an authorized recipient (reference paragraph 3.7), subject to the
     restrictions of 10 CFR 20.2001;
     3.10.6.2. Decay in storage (for RAM having a physical half-life less than 120 days)
     provided:
         3.10.6.2.1. Prior to disposal as ordinary trash, the container’s surface and contents
         shall be surveyed with the appropriate survey instrument set on its most sensitive
         scale and with no interposed shielding to determine that its radioactivity cannot be
         distinguished from natural background; and
         3.10.6.2.2. All radiation labels and markings shall be removed or obliterated; and
         3.10.6.2.3. A record of each disposal shall be retained for 3 years.
             3.10.6.2.3.1. The record must include the date of disposal, the date on which the
             byproduct material was placed in storage, the radionuclides disposed, the survey
             instrument used, the background dose rate, the dose rate measured at the surface
             of each waste container, and the name of the individual who performed the
             disposal. Medical Permittees must adhere to 10 CFR 35.92(b).

3.11. Cessation of Operations and Terminating Permits.
   3.11.1. If permitted operations cease, the Permittee must initiate decommissioning
   operations within two years of the date when use of the permitted material stops. For permits
   that are anticipated to be in a no-operations and/or storage only status for an extended period
   of time (greater than one year) the Permittee should request a permit amendment to place the
   permit in a no-operations and/or storage only status. This also applies to permits in
   decommissioning status for which decommissioning actions are in abeyance for an extended
   duration.
   3.11.2. An organization shall request termination of their permit within 30 days after
   appropriate disposal or transfer of all regulated RAM and conclusion of any required
   decommissioning operations.
   3.11.3. If a permit is allowed to expire, the permit authorizations remain in full force and
   effect for possession only of material, but ceases for use of the material. Permits will remain
   in possession only status until formally terminated.
   3.11.4. If a decommissioning plan is required IAW 10 CFR 30.36, 40.47, and 70.38, it must
   be submitted to the RICS for approval. Decommissioning plans will be reviewed by the
   RICS and offered to the NRC for their review.

      were turned into installation supply. Demonstrate that all materials received were either
 46                                                AFI40-201_90MWSUP_I 30 APRIL 2013


      disposed of, or transferred properly, and no permitted materials remain associated with
      the permit;
      3.11.6.3. A final status survey, if required, to demonstrate no RAM or residual
      contamination above limits for unrestricted release as prescribed in NUREG 1575, Rev 1,
      NUREG 1757, Volume II, and 10 CFR 20.1402; and
      3.11.6.4. For permits authorizing possession only sealed or plated sources, a final leak
      test demonstrating source integrity. Additionally, for permits authorizing possession only
      of short half-life material meeting the requirements of paragraph 3.10.6.2, a radiation
      survey/report demonstrating no residual radiation levels in use or storage areas are above
      background is required IAW NUREG 1575, Rev 1, Appendix B.
   3.11.7. Upon termination of the permit, provide all program-related documents to the RICS
   for final archiving. The RICS will determine the records required. Documents such as
   records of personnel exposure investigations, spills and contamination are of relevancy and
   will be maintained by the RICS.
3.12. Reporting Radioactive Material Incidents and Mishaps.
   3.12.1. Follow reporting criteria and time limits in Attachment 11. Reference Attachment
   12 for a general reporting checklist.
   3.12.2. The Permittee, the PRSO, and the IRSO must each ensure the RICS receives reports
   required by Attachment 11. Report an incident if you have any reservations about whether
   reporting is required.
   3.12.3. Report incidents initially by telephone (installations outside the United States may
   report by message/email) and confirm by fax or message. Report to the RICS by calling
   DSN 425-6308, Commercial (703) 588-6308, emailing USAF.RIC@pentagon.af.mil, or
   faxing to DSN 425-1272, Commercial (703) 588-1272.
      3.12.3.1. To report after normal duty hours, call the Andrews Regional Command Post,
      DSN 858-5058, or (301) 981-5058. Give your name, organization, DSN and commercial
      phone numbers. State that you are calling with a "radioactive material incident report"
      and ask for the AFMSA/SG3PB (RICS) duty officer.
      3.12.3.2. Inform the Installation Chief of Safety, MAJCOM/SEW, and IRSO of any
      INRAD or 91(b) material mishaps IAW AFI 91-204.

      AFSC/SEW through AF Safety Automated System of any abnormal exposures and/or
      suspected overexposures to personnel or the public from a mishap involving INRAD or
      91(b) material.
   3.12.4. Time limits for reports begin when the event occurs or is first discovered. Incidents
   requiring an immediate report must be forwarded within three (3) hours. Include as much of
   the information outlined in Attachments 11 and 13 as is available, but do not delay
   reporting if you have not collected all the pertinent information.
   3.12.5. The RICS directs follow-on written reports or information needed to comply with
   NRC regulations.
AFI40-201_90MWSUP_I 30 APRIL 2013                                                             47


   3.12.6. A copy of all written reports must be forwarded to the IRSO, Installation
   Commander, MAJCOM Bioenvironmental Engineer, MAJCOM functional office and
   AFIA/SG.
   3.12.7. The requirements in paragraphs 3.12.1 through 3.12.6 are separate from the
   reporting requirements of AFI 10-206 and AFI 91-204. This instruction does not prescribe
   the reporting requirements of incidents or mishaps involving only nuclear weapons, nuclear
   weapons parts, reactors and fuel assemblies, and space systems exempted from NRC
   regulatory authority under Section 91(b) of the AEA.
   3.12.8. EPA regulations require reporting releases of RAM characterized as hazardous
   substances under 40 CFR 302. The EPA lists some of the chemical forms of radionuclides
   and many of the non-radioactive chemical constituents that may be part of the release with
   radionuclides as a result of an industrial process. Report spills of radionuclides or mixed
   hazardous materials to the environment IAW AFI 10-2501. These reports are separate from
   the reporting requirements described in this instruction.
   3.12.9. Radiological incidents that could potentially expose members of the general public or
   accidental releases of RAM to the environment must be reported to civilian authorities. The
   IRSO provides information, approved by the installation commander, and sent through the
   installation public affairs office, of these types of incidents. Security restrictions on
   classified information shall be adhered to except in cases of immediate risk to health and/or
   significant environmental impact.
   3.12.10. Safeguard classified information when making reports. Special care shall be taken
   when reporting and investigating an incident or mishap under AFI 91-204 to ensure that
   reports forwarded to the RICS do not contain classified or sensitive unclassified information.
   All reports involving RAM exceeding NRC quantities of concern shall be handled as
   sensitive information and transmitted as directed by the RICS. All information will be
   properly marked and secured from unauthorized access.
   3.12.11. By Federal law, the USAF must give the NRC certain types of information
   normally protected from release. When investigating the cause of an incident or mishap and
   the involvement of persons for reports under this instruction, do not compromise
   confidentiality of information.
3.13. Response to Radioactive Materials Incidents and Mishaps.

      3.13.3.3. If radioactive contamination is detected, take action as soon as possible to
      identify, notify and assess those initial responders or other personnel who might have
      been contaminated during initial life-saving operations.
      3.13.3.4. Collect and segregate RAM at the incident/mishap site after immediate life-
      saving and incident control actions are complete.
   3.13.4. When responding to aircraft incidents, recognize that cargo and/or aircraft
   components may contain RAM. Examples include:
      3.13.4.1. Licensed or permitted RAM or items containing licensed or permitted RAM in
      the cargo.
      3.13.4.2. Munitions, ballast and counterweights made of DU.
      3.13.4.3. Magnesium-thorium in airframe and engine parts.

   3.13.5. Electron tubes, ignition and spark gaps, or other items may contain exempt quantities
   of radionuclides and present a minimal hazard risk when damaged. Use gloves when
   handling, and bag or wrap damaged items for proper disposal.
3.14. Investigating Radioactive Materials Incidents and Accidents.
   3.14.1. The Permittee is responsible for investigating and preparing a report on events listed
   in paragraph 3.12 and Attachment 11 that involve permitted RAM, unless directed
   otherwise by higher authority. The PRSO, assisted by the IRSO, normally performs the
   investigation.
   3.14.2. The Commander of the affected organization is responsible for the investigation and
   report for reportable events not involving permitted materials. The IRSO normally performs
   the investigation.
   3.14.3. Investigating a mishap or incident according to AFI 91-204 may generate
   information requiring a separate report that can be forwarded to the NRC. Reference
   paragraphs 3.12.10 and 3.12.11 about protecting classified information. Consult with the
   RICS.
   3.14.4. Forward reports to organizations listed in paragraph 3.12.6.
   3.14.5. The RICS will decide when an investigation of an event involving RAM governed by
   this instruction is complete.
   3.14.6. The NRC, AFIA/SG, or the RICS reserves the right to independently investigate an
   incident or mishap involving permitted or NRC-licensed RAM to confirm USAF reports or
AFI40-201_90MWSUP_I 30 APRIL 2013                                                              49


   to decide whether the installation violated permit conditions, this instruction or Federal
   regulations (reference paragraph 3.16).
3.15. Retaining Records. Records shall be retained for the receipt, storage, distribution, use,
transfer, disposal and incident involving permitted or licensed RAM IAW 10 CFRs Parts 19, 20,
30-36, 40, 70, 71, as implemented in https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.
If a conflict exists, then maintain records with the more stringent retention period. Reference
Attachment 7 for retention periods.
3.16. Inspecting Permit Holders and Enforcing Compliance.
   3.16.1. Inspections: Inspections of Permittees issued USAF RAM permits shall be
   conducted by AFIA/SG, the RICS, and/or the NRC. Unannounced inspections are routinely
   conducted to assess compliance with permit conditions, AF instructions, and Federal
   regulations. Detailed inspection policy for permits is provided in Attachment 13.
       3.16.1.1. The permit type and scope sets the frequency and content of routine AFIA/SG
       inspections.
       3.16.1.2. An inspection priority code is assigned to each permit (refer to the cover letter
       issuing the permit or permit renewal). A priority 1 permit is a high priority permit
       inspected annually; a priority 3 permit is inspected every three years. More frequent
       inspections may be made based on scale of economies during travel, to enforce
       compliance, evaluate a specific problem or follow-up to determine if corrective actions
       have been taken.

91(a) Material—RAM exempted from NRC licensing controls under Section 91(a) of the AEA
of 1954, as amended, in the interest of national defense, under the possession of the DOE.
91(b) Material—RAM exempted from NRC licensing controls under Section 91(b) of the AEA
of 1954, as amended, in the interest of national defense, under the possession of the DOD. These
include materials in nuclear weapons.
Accelerator Produced Radioactive Material—RAM produced as the result of operating a
particle accelerator.
Agreement State—Any state, territory, or possession of the United States that, by agreement
with the NRC, has assumed regulatory authority over byproduct, source, and certain small
quantities of SNM.
Allegation—Declaration, statement or assertion of impropriety or inadequacy associated with
NRC or USAF regulated activities, the validity of which has not been established.
Alternate Permit Radiation Safety Officer—A person, named on the USAF RAM Permit, who
is qualified by education or training, to act as PRSO when the primary PRSO is absent. Unless
otherwise requested by the Permittee, the alternate PRSO becomes the primary PRSO when the
named primary PRSO leaves the organization.
Annual—Recurring, done, or performed every year (i.e., every 12 months).
 58                                                  AFI40-201_90MWSUP_I 30 APRIL 2013


As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA)—The principle that personnel exposures must
be maintained as low as possible consistent with existing technology, cost, and operational
requirements.
Authorized User—For non-medical permits, authorized users are approved by the RSC or in the
absence of an RSC, the RICS based on a review of qualifications. For medical permits, IAW 10
CFR 35.2: a physician, dentist or podiatrist who meets the requirements in 10 CFR 35.59, and
35.190(a), 35.290(a), 35.390(a), 35.392(a), 35.394(a), 35.490(a), 35.590(a) or 35.690(a), and is
an authorized user as specified on a USAF RAM permit.
Byproduct Material—RAM (except source or SNM) yielded in, or made radioactive by,
exposure to the radiation incident to the process of producing or using source or SNM. The
definition of byproduct material has changed with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to include
some forms of naturally occurring or accelerator produced RAM (reference AFPD 40-2).
Exclusive Federal Jurisdiction—Property under the exclusive control or ownership of the
Federal government that has been ceded legislative power by the state or has had such power
reserved from grants to the states.
General License—The NRC and/or an Agreement State issues a general license for individuals
to acquire and use specific devices that have been manufactured and distributed according to the
specifications approved by the NRC or the Agreement State. Individuals do not need to apply
for this license; it is inherent in the distribution of the device. However, they must comply with
the requirements for labeling, instructions for use, and proper storage or disposition of the
device.
Human Use—The internal or external administration of RAM, to humans.
Incident— For purpose of this instruction, an incident is any event involving RAM that is not
defined as a mishap or medical event, or that may result in adverse public reaction. This
includes   weather-induced      events,   attacks     against   sensitive    information   or
spontaneous/unforeseen failures of equipment or material.
Items—Instruments, manufactured articles or major end items constructed of or having RAM as
a component part, often assigned a NSN, normally procured, stored and distributed through
USAF and Department of Defense logistical supply systems. Items include but are not limited to
such devices as Chemical Agent Detectors, RADIAC sets, Lensatic compasses, dials and gauges.
Items are not considered to include any loose RAM, radioactive contamination on other materials
or in soil, or any material exhumed from a radioactive burial site.
License—Written authorization from the NRC or an Agreement State to acquire, receive, use,
store or transfer byproduct, source, or SNM. Licenses will be either (1) General License
published in NRC or Agreement State Regulations, that is effective without any need to send an
application to, or that is effective to any applicant on registration with, the NRC or an Agreement
State or (2) Specific License issued by the NRC or Agreement State to a named applicant who
has filed an application authorizing acquisition, ownership, receipt, storage, use, transfer, and
disposal of chemical or physical forms of radioisotopes specified in the license. This license has
an expiration date renewable on application to the issuing authority. The license may be limited
in scope (authorizing only certain specific radioisotopes for limited users) or broad (authorizing
the use of a wide variety of radioisotopes without regard to form, quantity, or use).

Medical Event—any event that meets the criteria of 10 CFR 35.3045(a).
Mishap—For purposes of this instruction, a mishap is defined in AFI 91-202. It is an event
involving human acts of omission or commission involving a nuclear reactor, radioisotope power
system, or RAM resulting in any of the following:
1) A loss of control of RAM that presents a hazard to life, health, or property. This includes loss
of control that may result in any person in an unrestricted area exceeding the limits for exposure
to ionizing radiation as stated in Title 10, CFR, Part 20, Standards for Protection Against
Radiation.
2) Any unexpected event involving RAM or radiation exposure that is serious enough to warrant
the interest or action of officials or agencies outside the USAF. This category includes event:
having domestic or international implications, those that may cause inquiries by the public or
press, and those requiring immediate notification to the NRC under Title 10, Code of Federal
Regulations, Part 20, Standards for Protection Against Radiation.

cobalt-57, and iodine-123. Also included is any discrete source of naturally occurring RAM
(other than source material) that the NRC determines could pose a public health or security.
Nuclear Reactor—A facility using fissile materials in a self-supporting chain reaction (nuclear
fission) to produce heat or radiation for both practical applications and research and
development.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission—An agency established by Title II of the Energy
Reorganization Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-438) to regulate byproduct, source, and SNM as
provided for by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. Within the NRC, final authority
rests with the five member Commission acting as a body.

for the purpose of inducing high energy reactions or producing high energy radiation.
Permit—Shortened term for USAF or USN RAM Permit. See USAF RAM Permit.
Permittee—The Commander, civilian equivalent or designated representative of a USAF
organization that is responsible for and controls the radiation safety program for RAM covered
by this instruction and has the authority to provide the resources necessary to achieve regulatory
compliance.
Prescribed Dosage—The quantity of radiopharmaceutical activity as documented in (1) a
written directive or (2) in the diagnostic clinical procedures manual or in any proper record
according to the directions of the authorized user for diagnostic procedures.
Prescribed Dose—(1) For gamma stereotactic radiosurgery: The total dose as documented in the
written directive, (2) For brachytherapy: Either the total source strength and exposure time or the
total dose, as documented in the written directive.

Radiation Safety Officer—An individual with specific education, military training, and
professional experience in radiation protection practice appointed by a Permittee or the USAF
Radioisotope Committee to manage radiation safety programs. The term "Radiation Safety
Officer" is a functional title and does not denote a commissioned status or specialty code. The
RSO must have the education, military training, and professional experience needed for the job.
Take care when addressing RSO qualifications and duties to distinguish between IRSO and
PRSOs. Individuals appointed as the IRSO might not always have the specific technical
experience and training needed to qualify as the PRSO.
Radioactive Item—A single unit or article constructed of or having RAM, greater than exempt
quantities, as a component part.
Radioactive Material (RAM)—Materials whose nuclei, because of their unstable nature, decay
by emission of ionizing radiation. The radiation emitted may be alpha particles, beta particles,
gamma rays, X-rays, or neutrons.
Radioactive Waste—Waste that contains RAM. Radioactive waste can be generally classed in
one of four categories:
High-Level Radioactive Waste (HLRW)—HLRW is spent nuclear fuel from nuclear power
plants and waste material from reprocessing spent nuclear fuel.
Transuranic Waste—Waste material that contains transuranic elements with half-lives greater
than 20 years and concentrations greater than 100 nanoCuries per gram. A transuranic is an
element with an atomic number greater than 92 (e.g., plutonium, americium, curium).
Low-level Radioactive Waste (LLRW)—LLRW is any radioactive waste that is not HLRW,
uranium tailings, or transuranic waste.
Mixed Waste—A waste that contains both hazardous waste as defined by the Resource
Conservation and Recovery ACT (RCRA) and source, special nuclear or byproduct material
subject to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG)—A power system using the thermal energy
produced by the radioactive decay of the unstable nuclei of certain isotopes as its energy source.
Restricted Area—For this instruction, a restricted area is an area having access limited to
protect individuals against undue risks from exposure to radiation and RAM. Restricted area
does not include areas used as residential quarters, but separate rooms in a residential building
may be set apart as a restricted area.
SAFE HAVEN—Temporary storage provided Department of Energy classified shipment
transporters at Department of Defense facilities in order to assure safety and security of nuclear
material and/or non-nuclear classified material.
Source Material—Uranium or thorium or any combination thereof in any physical or chemical
form; or ores that have, by weight, one-twentieth of 1 percent (0.05 percent) or more of uranium,
thorium, or any combination thereof. Source material does not include SNM.
Specifically Licensed Material—RAM controlled by a specific NRC or Agreement State
license or USAF, USN, or VA permit.
AFI40-201_90MWSUP_I 30 APRIL 2013                                                              61


Special Nuclear Material (SNM)—Plutonium, uranium-233, uranium enriched in the isotope
233 or in the isotope 235; any other material that the NRC determines to be SNM and any
material artificially enriched by the foregoing. SNM does not include source material.
Unrestricted Area—For this instruction, an unrestricted area is any area access to which is not
controlled by the Permittee. Generally, it is an area that is accessible to a person who is not
trained to work with RAM or accessible to a member of the public.
USAF Master Materials License (MML)—The single NRC license issued to the Department
of the Air Force delegating to the USAF regulatory authority over byproduct, source, and limited
quantities of SNM used by the USAF.
USAF Radioactive Material Permit—Written authorization from the USAF Radioisotope
Committee for USAF organizations to receive, possess, use, distribute, store, transport, transfer
and dispose of RAM. Permits parallel NRC licenses in applications and scope. The USAF’s
Master Materials License, and Broad Scope licensees, issue permits which are equivalent to
NRC licenses for authorizing NRC regulated material. Unlike the NRC, a single permit may
authorize byproduct, source, SNM, and NARM.
USAF Radioisotope Committee (RIC)—A committee established IAW requirements of the
USAF Master Materials License to coordinate the administrative and regulatory aspects of
permitting, acquiring,, receiving, possessing, using, distributing, storing, transporting,
transferring and disposing of all RAM in the USAF, except that material transferred from the
Department of Energy to the Department of Defense in nuclear weapon systems, certain
radioactive parts of weapons systems and nuclear reactor systems, parts and fuel controlled under
Section 91(a) or 91(b) of the AEA. It is composed of stake-holder representatives from Staff Air
Force and Headquarters Air Force.
USAF Radioisotope Committee Secretariat (RICS)—The office providing day-to-day
management of USAF permitting activities under the purview of the USAF MML. The
Secretariat generally comprises members from Radiation Health function of AFMSA / SG3PB).
User—For this instruction, a user is (1) An organization authorized by a USAF RAM Permit to
have and use RAM, or (2) A person specifically named on a USAF RAM Permit as authorized to
handle or to supervise handling RAM listed on the permit, or (3) A person named in a permit
condition by a radiation safety committee with local approval authority to handle or supervise the
handling of RAM listed on the permit. Also see Authorized User.
Written Directive— an authorized user’s record written order for the administration of by
product material or radiation from byproduct material to a specific patient or human research
subject, as specified in 10 CFR 35.40. An order must be in writing for a specific patient, dated
and signed by an authorized user before the administration of I-131 greater than 30 microCuries,
any therapeutic dosage of unsealed byproduct material or any therapeutic dose of radiation from
byproduct material.

                                                           requested by RICS.
A2.3. Business Practices.
    A2.3.1. The RIC Chair and the RICS will establish the detailed procedures for RIC
    meetings. In all cases, the meetings will meet the requirements of the USAF MML and other
    USAF requirements for meetings of this type.
         A2.3.1.1. In accordance with MML requirements, a formal RIC meeting shall occur as
         represented to and agreed upon by the AF and NRC. RIC meetings are schedule by the
         RICS.
         A2.3.1.2. Ad hoc meetings can be called by the RIC Chair on an as needed basis. These
         meetings are called to address emergent issues that require timely action by the RIC.
         A2.3.1.3. Rapid staffing of an action can be approved by the RIC Chair to address
         emergent issues for which an ad hoc meeting cannot be convened. For a rapid staffing
         the RICS will prepare a staffing package that addresses the issue and provides the voting
         members of the RIC the ability to vote without meeting. All rapid staffing actions will be
         discussed at the next RIC meeting.
 64                                                 AFI40-201_90MWSUP_I 30 APRIL 2013


      A2.3.1.4. A quorum for a meeting is established by having a least one-half of the voting
      members present.
   A2.3.2. Meetings will be conducted IAW all applicable policies and procedures. The RIC
   Chair and the RICS will establish the specific procedures for the conduct of routine meetings,
   ad hoc meetings and rapid-staffing actions.
   A2.3.3. Motions and Voting.
      A2.3.3.1. Only members and guests recognized by the Chair may speak.
      A2.3.3.2. Only voting members may vote on an issue.
      A2.3.3.3. Generally, before any item can be discussed, there should be a motion made
      and seconded. Once a motion has been seconded, discussion will follow. After
      discussion, one of four things can happen:
          A2.3.3.3.1. There can be a vote on the motion. In the event of a tie, the Chair casts
          the deciding vote; or
          A2.3.3.3.2. The motion can be amended (second required). Then there can be
          discussion on the amendment. The amendment can be voted. If the amendment
          passes, the motion automatically passes. If the amendment fails, the motion still
          stands and can be discussed until voted; or
          A2.3.3.3.3. The motion can be tabled (second required). There can be no discussion
          on a motion to table--a vote must be taken immediately. If the vote is to table, no
          further discussion can take place on the motion; or
          A2.3.3.3.4. There may be no action on the motion--therefore it becomes old business
          at a future meeting.
      A2.3.3.4. Motions must be clear and concise. A motion to "improve permitting
      practices" would be vague and discussions could meander. However, a motion to
      "implement template permit processes for a new chemical agent monitor" is specific and
      could be effectively discussed and acted on.
A2.4. Disagreement Resolution. The RIC Chair is responsible for maintaining order. On
procedural questions, the Chair's ruling will be final.
A2.5. Record Keeping.
   A2.5.1. The RICS will ensure that appropriate files for each meeting are maintained IAW all
   applicable requirements. This will include as a minimum, the agenda, meeting minutes, copy
   of all pertinent reference materials, background information, memoranda, standing reports,
   and presentations applicable to each meeting.
   A2.5.2. RICS will maintain correspondence, permit actions, NOVs or enforcement actions,
   and other applicable materials during the quarter to ensure a complete agenda.
   A2.5.3. Records of RIC meetings, to include agendas, presentations, and meeting minutes,
   shall be kept for the duration of existence of the MML.

Hazardous Material Information Resource System. GLDs shall be registered in the USAF
logistics system and identified as radioactive and inventoried in RAMMIS.
A3.3. Requirements for Possession of GLDs under 10 CFR 31. 5. All USAF units will
comply with Sealed Source and Device Registry (SSDR) requirements for each specific GLD
device type. In addition:
   A3.3.1. All USAF units will ensure that the IRSO enters all GLDs (e.g., radioluminescent
   exit signs, some chemical agent monitors) into the RAMMIS database and keeps the
   RAMMIS database current.
66                                                  AFI40-201_90MWSUP_I 30 APRIL 2013


  A3.3.2. Units with GLDs that do not possess a USAF RAM permit will appoint a
  responsible individual to ensure that the requirements of the SSDR are met and that the
  RAMMIS inventory is current. For units with issued permits, the PRSO will be the
  responsible individual. The responsible individual shall:
     A3.3.2.1. Provide the IRSO an updated inventory every six months so that the IRSO can
     input the data into RAMMIS.
     A3.3.2.2. Preserve all labels affixed to the device and ensure all the instructions are
     followed.
     A3.3.2.3. If required by the SSDR, the device shall be tested for leakage, and proper
     operation of any on-off mechanism or indicator, if any, at no longer than 6 month
     intervals, or as specified by the SSDR. All leak tests will be coordinated with the IRSO
     so that appropriate protocols and materials are used. The following do not require leak
     tests:

  When multiple isotopes of concern are present compliance is determined by ensuring that the
sum of the ratio of the amount of an isotope on hand to the amount of the level above for each
isotope on hand needs to be less than or equal to 1.

  TBq values are the regulatory standard and the curie values are rounded to two significant
figures.

  Radioactive materials are to be considered collocated if breaching a common physical security
barrier (e.g., a locked door at the entrance to a storage room) would allow access to the RAM or
devices containing the RAM. For sources installed in devices, each device should be considered
a separate location.

   A10.1.5. Before sealing a waste container, the PRSO must:
      A10.1.5.1. Verify for each waste container, the legibility and completeness of each waste
      entry, and visually inspect the containerized waste. To prevent contamination of
      personnel or the area, do not physically remove or handle the waste from the container.
      A10.1.5.2. Survey the container to ensure that detected radiation levels correspond to the
      entries recorded in the waste log. Note: A container storing a low-energy beta emitters or
      small quantities of a low-energy gamma emitter (e.g., Iodine-125) would not have high
      levels of X or gamma radiation. Gamma surveys shall be conducted on these containers
      to ensure that high energy gamma emitting sources were not improperly placed in the
      container or that Bremsstrahlung radiation is not being produced at significant levels to
      cause a potential hazard.

   in long-term storage.
   A10.2.4. Do not open waste containers to conduct periodic inspections.
   A10.2.5. Ensure storage areas are properly ventilated prior to survey.
   A10.2.6. The PRSO shall conduct a final inspection of radioactive waste containers for
   integrity of the container and container seal; accuracy and completeness of log entries; proper
   markings and labels; and perform required surveys prior to removing the containers for
   transfer or disposal.
   A10.2.7. The PRSO will file inventory sheets and waste logs in the PRSO’s permanent
   records of the permit authorizing long-term storage of the waste after disposal or transfer of
   each waste container.
   A10.2.8. Do not store liquid waste more than one (1) year. Solidify the waste with the help
   of AFRRAD.

                                    REPORTING CRITERIA

A11.1. In general, there are two types of reporting criteria. The first are those that are specific
to one part of the CFR such as the need to report a radiography source that has been
unintentionally disconnected from the control cable e.g., 10 CFR 34.101(a) (1). The second are
general criteria that apply to any event, such as the need to report any personnel exposure that
exceeds license or NRC standards, such as the personnel exposure reporting requirements
contained in 10 CFR 20.2202 and 20.2203. It is important to keep both in mind when assessing
whether an event is reportable; if it is reportable, determine the reporting methods, timetables
and information requirements. For example, a call is received from a radiography site that a
radiographer may have been overexposed. The investigation reveals that the dose received was
less than that required for a reportable event. However the event was caused by the source
unintentionally coming loose from the cable and was actually a reportable event under 10 CFR
34.101(a) (1). Table A11.1 is a summary of the key information required for each event to
ensure complete reporting.

                                        Attachment 13
                                   INSPECTION POLICY

A13.1. Introduction. The inspection program for permitted and generally licensed RAM serves
to assess compliance with permit conditions, this instruction and Federal regulations (e.g., NRC
and DOT). The frequency and duration of the inspection shall be based on the inspection priority
assigned by the RICS, complexity of the permit, overall risks of the permitted activity, and
opportunity to witness infrequent or unique procedures.
A13.2. Inspection Protocol.
   A13.2.1. Inspections of permits shall be conducted by the Air Force Inspection Agency,
   Medical Operations Directorate (AFIA/SG), the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
   (NRC), AFMSA/SG3PB, or collaboratively. Inspections are conducted IAW NRC Manual
   Chapter 2800, Materials Inspection Program, and as necessary, may apply a "prescriptive"
   evaluation to ensure the implementing conditions of this instruction are accomplished.
   A13.2.2. Inspections by either organization shall avoid interference with the Permittee’s
   operational obligations; however, a Permittee shall not delay inspections based on
   inconvenience. Note: 10 CFR 30.52 states, "Each licensee shall afford to the NRC at all
   reasonable times the opportunity to inspect byproduct material and the premises and facilities
   wherein byproduct material is used or stored. Each licensee shall make available to the NRC
   for inspection, upon reasonable notice, records kept by him." This access shall also be
   afforded to AFIA/SG or AFMSA/SG3PB. Permittees failing to submit to or afford an
   inspection may be issued a violation for non-compliance.
   A13.2.3. The AFIA/SG or AFMSA/SG3PB inspector shall be in uniform; credentialed with
   a DOD common access card (CAC) and either possess a badge, orders, authorization letter or
   a list of telephone numbers from which the Permittee may call for verification. The inspector
   shall have a clearance verified in the Joint Clearance and Access Verification System
   (JCAVS). The NRC shall have identification and, as necessary, be able to demonstrate
   appropriate clearance. The Permittee has a right and duty to challenge unknown individuals
   presenting themselves as inspectors.
   A13.2.4. Inspections are generally conducted on-site and unannounced IAW AFI 90-201,
   Inspector General Activities, paragraph 2.1.1. Inspections may be conducted at times outside
   of normal duty hours, particularly when the use or receipt of permitted material is conducted.
   A valid inspection involves AFIA/SG or AFMSA/SG3PB contact with the Permittee, PRSO
   or cognizant individual using material covered by the permit. Inspections that cannot be
   conducted due to operational obligations or the unavailability of applicable personnel may be
   rescheduled if coordinated with AFIA/SG or AFMSA/SG3PB.
   A13.2.5. A unit that has deployed the PRSO and does not have an available alternate PRSO
   is still subject to inspection. The permit shall be revised to possession only during the PRSO
   deployment and an administrative officer should be named to the permit. Failure to comply
   with the conditions of the permit, this instruction or Federal regulations may result in a
   violation for non-compliance, particularly if permitted material is not properly secured and
   controlled.
AFI40-201_90MWSUP_I 30 APRIL 2013                                                             107


   A13.2.6. Neither AFIA/SG nor AFMSA/SG3PB is required to pre-inspect any unit prior to
   an NRC inspection. Units are expected to be in compliance at all times.
   A13.2.7. Telephonic inspections may be performed IAW NRC Priority T criteria. These are
   generally performed for routine inspections of template permits possessing permitted RAM
   and for follow-up inspections of permits that have yet to receive permitted RAM. Permittees
   will be notified by AFIA/SG of the scheduled date and time for the telephonic inspection as
   well as the date and time to submit requested permit documentation. Permittees failing to
   submit documentation or submit to a telephonic inspection without prior coordination with
   AFIA/SG may be issued a violation for non-compliance. As necessary, an on-site or
   telephonic follow-up inspection may be conducted at any time.
   A13.2.8. Stop Action. During the course of an inspection, AFIA/SG or AFMSA/SG3PB
   may determine a procedure or practice to be imminently dangerous to life and health (IDLH).
   In those cases, the inspector shall require the Permittee to temporarily cease operations until
   corrective action is taken. As necessary, the RICS shall be contacted. The inspector shall
   not ask the Permittee to perform a task that is hazardous, in contravention to the permit, this
   instruction, Federal regulations or has potential to disrupt operational activities.
   A13.2.9. The AFIA/SG or AFMSA/SG3PB inspector shall offer to conduct an out-brief with
   the PRSO, Permittee or cognizant individual(s). The out-brief shall include discussion of the
   inspection scope, contacts, results, and preliminary rating. In cases where the inspection
   reveals significant findings or Severity Level I-III violation(s), an out-brief with the
   Permittee and his/her commander shall be mandatory.                AFIA/SG will contact
   AFMSA/SG3PB prior to the out-brief of these type of findings. Following an inspection,
   AFIA/SG may request clarifying or additional information from the Permittee.
   A13.2.10. AFIA/SG shall generate a final report and assign a rating in 60 duty days. The
   Permittee must initiate corrective actions in advance of any report. At a minimum, the final
   report shall be submitted to the Permittee, RICS, and the Permittee’s MAJCOM/IG and SG.
A13.3. Inspection Types.
   A13.3.1. New permit. Shall be conducted approximately six months after permitted
   materials are received. Permittees are required to immediately notify AFIA/SG when
   permitted materials have been received.
   A13.3.2. Routine. Shall be conducted at intervals established by the permit or as established
   in NUREG 1556, Volume 20. Inspection frequency may be changed based on Permittee
   performance.
   A13.3.3. Follow-up. Shall be conducted when Permittees receive NRC Severity Level I-III
   violations. Such may also be requested by the RIC. They will occur within a year following
   closure of corrective actions.
   A13.3.4. Collaborative. AFIA/SG may choose to accompany the NRC during an inspection.
   NRC inspections may occur at any time and are not bound by the intervals established by the
   permit or recentness of the last AFIA/SG inspection. Conversely, the NRC may choose to
   accompany AFIA/SG during an inspection. Typically, the NRC does not issue a report under
   these conditions.
 108                                                AFI40-201_90MWSUP_I 30 APRIL 2013


   A13.3.5. Incident. May be conducted based on concern expressed by the RICS, the NRC or
   following a significant event (e.g., personnel health and safety violations, loss of control of
   RAM, radiation exposure exceeding regulatory guidelines, natural disaster or equipment
   failures). In these instances, AFIA/SG or AFMSA/SG3PB may conduct an off-cycle visit or
   inspection either unannounced or scheduled. This type of inspection is generally not rated
   but a report may be generated.
   A13.3.6. Consultancy. Upon request of the Permittee, AFIA/SG or AFMSA/SG3PB may
   conduct a scheduled visit to identify areas where assistance and improvements can be made.
   Furthermore, AFIA/SG or AFMSA/SG3PB may conduct a scheduled visit to advise the
   Permittee on how to implement new AFIs or Federal regulations. Consultancy visits,
   requested by the Permittee, are generally funded by the requesting organization. This type of
   visit shall not be rated but a report should be generated.
   A13.3.7. Permit Termination. A termination inspection may be scheduled and conducted
   during or following the termination of a broad scope permit, remediation activity or
   permitted activity involving significant amounts of unsealed RAM, to assure the criteria of
   10 CFR 20, Subpart E are met. This type of inspection shall not be rated but a report may be
   generated.
   A13.3.8. Special Emphasis. Certain topics to be researched, as requested by the RICS are
   conducted by AFIA/SG. These Special Emphasis Item (SEI) studies are conducted
   according to AFI 90-201. SEIs are normally terminated within 6-12 months, and the results
   are briefed at the annual IG-SG Annual Review.
   A13.3.9. Other. Wherever there is geographic clustering of permits, it may be advantageous
   for AFIA/SG to accelerate the date of the next inspection. This predominantly applies to
   permits with a 5 or 7-year inspection frequency and within one or two years of their next
   inspection. This would serve to align the inspection frequency of similar permits in a
   geographic region to reduce repetitive travel.
A13.4. Severity Levels of Violations.
   A13.4.1. AF issued violations have been generally cross-referenced to NRC categories and
   severity levels. Since regulatory requirements have varying degrees of safety, safeguards, or
   environmental significance, violations of given requirements have differing levels of
   significance that are represented by the severity levels.
   A13.4.2. Comparisons of severity between disparate activities (e.g., nuclear medicine vs.
   gauges) will not be made. Severity is assigned on a case-by-case basis. Repeat violations,
   willfulness and false representations will influence the severity of a violation.
   A13.4.3. Minor violations are less severe than those defined as Severity Level IV violations.
   A response with corrective actions is required to be submitted IAW paragraphs A13.5 and
   A13.7. Examples might include:
       A13.4.3.1. Lapse in inventory/transfer records without loss of material.
       A13.4.3.2. Lapse in PRSO appointment or expired permit without impact on safety.
   A13.4.4. Severity Level IV violations involve non-compliance with NRC requirements, non-
   compliance with permit conditions, this instruction, or Federal regulations and pose an
   increased, but generally, minimal, risk to safety and health. A response with corrective
AFI40-201_90MWSUP_I 30 APRIL 2013                                                             109


   actions is required to be submitted IAW paragraphs A13.5 and A13.7 AFIA/SG may
   recommend the RICS close violations in advance of enforcement if corrective actions can be
   demonstrated during the inspection or within five (5) duty days thereafter. Examples
   include:
      A13.4.4.1. Failure to maintain and implement radiation programs to keep radiation
      exposures ALARA, and/or
      A13.4.4.2. Information that the NRC requires be kept by a Permittee and that is
      incomplete or inaccurate and of more than minor significance (e.g., area survey records).
   A13.4.5. Severity Level III violations are cause for regulatory concern as violations of this
   nature pose a significant risk to safety, health and/or security of permitted RAM. The
   Permittee shall immediately contact (within 24 hours) the RICS following the violation
   notification/issuance by AFIA/SG. A response with corrective actions is required to be
   submitted IAW paragraphs A13.5 and A13.7. Examples include:
      A13.4.5.1. Conduct of licensee activities by a technically unqualified person, and/or
      A13.4.5.2. Delay in notifying the RIC upon loss of RAM.
   A13.4.6. Severity Level II violations involve actual or high potential consequence to public
   health, worker safety, and/or control of RAM. The Permittee shall immediately contact
   (within 24 hours) the RICS following the violation notification/issuance by AFIA/SG. A
   response with corrective actions is required to be submitted to the RICS within five (5) duty
   days of Permittee’s receipt of the report. A response with corrective actions is required to be
   submitted IAW paragraphs A13.5 and A13.7 Examples include:
      A13.4.6.1. A radiation exposure of a declared pregnant worker during the gestational
      period in excess of 1.0 rem TEDE, and/or
      A13.4.6.2. "Significant information identified by a Permittee" and not provided to
      AFIA/SG or the RIC because of careless disregard on the part of the PRSO.
   A13.4.7. Severity Level I violations involve actual or high potential consequences to public
   health, worker safety, and/or control of RAM but is deemed more significant than a Severity
   Level II violation by the inspector. The Permittee shall immediately contact (within 24
   hours) the RICS following the violation notification/issuance by AFIA/SG. A response with
   corrective actions is required to be submitted to the RICS within five (5) duty days of
   Permittee’s receipt of the report. A response with corrective actions is required to be
   submitted IAW paragraphs A13.5 and A13.7 Examples include:
      A13.4.7.1. An annual exposure of a member of the public in excess of 1.0 rem TEDE,
      and/or
      A13.4.7.2. Inaccurate or incomplete information provided to AFIA/SG, RIC or the NRC
      in a deliberate nature, under official pretense and knowing such was incomplete.
A13.5. Inspection Violations and Actions.
   A13.5.1. Minor. Permittees shall have five (5) duty days from the receipt of the report to
   respond in writing to the RICS, AFIA/SG and their respective MAJCOM. The RIC/S
   reserves the right to accelerate the time of the response. The RIC/S may take enforcement
   against a Permittee who doesn’t demonstrate timeliness or sufficiency of corrective actions.
 110                                                  AFI40-201_90MWSUP_I 30 APRIL 2013


   A13.5.2. Severity Level IV. Permittees shall have five (5) duty days from the receipt of the
   report to respond in writing to the RICS, AFIA/SG and their respective MAJCOM. The
   RIC/S reserves the right to accelerate the time of the response. The RICS may take
   enforcement against a Permittee who doesn’t demonstrate timeliness or sufficiency of
   corrective actions.
   A13.5.3. Severity Level I-III. Permittees shall have five (5) duty days from the receipt of
   the report to respond in writing to the RICS, AFIA/SG and their respective MAJCOM.
   Permittees shall respond by email or in writing, within 24 hours upon verbal notification or
   report, whichever occurs first, to the RICS; the Permitee shall provide immediate actions
   taken to mitigate the violation. The RIC/S reserves the right to accelerate the time of the
   response. The RIC/S may take enforcement against a Permittee who doesn’t demonstrate
   timeliness or sufficiency of corrective actions.
   A13.5.4. Stop Action. During the course of an inspection, AFIA/SG may determine a
   procedure or practice to be imminently dangerous to life and health (IDLH). In those cases,
   the inspector shall require the Permittee to temporarily cease operations (Stop Action) until
   corrective action is taken. The RICS shall be contacted as necessary. The inspector shall not
   ask the Permittee to perform a task that is hazardous, in contravention to the permit, this
   instruction, Federal regulations or has potential to disrupt operational activities.
   A13.5.5. The AFIA/SG inspector shall offer to conduct an out-brief with the PRSO,
   Permittee or cognizant individual(s). In cases where the inspection reveals significant
   findings or Severity Level I-III violation(s), an out-brief with the Permittee and his/her
   commander shall be mandatory. Moreover, AFIA/SG will contact the RICS prior to the out-
   brief of these type of findings. Following an inspection, AFIA/SG may call the Permittee for
   clarifying information. Unless in conflict with this section, AFIA/SG shall generate a final
   report and assign a rating in 60 duty days. The Permittee must initiate corrective actions in
   advance of any report.
   A13.5.6. At a minimum, the final report shall be submitted to the Permittee, the RICS, and
   the Permittee’s MAJCOM/SG.
   A13.5.7. On a quarterly basis, AFIA/SG shall provide the RIC a summary of inspection
   findings.
A13.6. Ratings. AFIA/SG will issue either a rating of “Compliant” or “Not Fully Compliant”
in the final report. Inspections that are Not Fully Compliant will report corrective actions to
violations IAW paragraphs A13.5 and A13.7. Whereas there may be no RAM or performance
objectives to evaluate, a rating will not be issued.
A13.7. Corrective Actions. When a violation is issued during an inspection, corrective actions
shall commence promptly. Permittees shall respond to the violations according to the provisions
of this attachment. The Permittee shall decide if the response needs to be coordinated with
higher authorities. Response to violations shall contain, at a minimum, the following:
   A13.7.1. Reference to the violation(s).
   A13.7.2. Complete description of how the violations(s) were or will be corrected to include:
       A13.7.2.1. The root cause for the violation(s) or, if contested, the basis for disputing it,
       A13.7.2.2. Corrective actions that have been taken and the results achieved,
AFI40-201_90MWSUP_I 30 APRIL 2013                                                               111


       A13.7.2.3. Corrective actions that will be taken to avoid future violations, and
       A13.7.2.4. Timeline, with milestones, for corrective actions and date when full
       compliance was or will be achieved.
   A13.7.3. Designation of an office for monitoring corrective measures, to include a point of
   contact.
   A13.7.4. Signature of the Permittee. “For” signatures shall not be accepted without
   certification the Permittee is aware of the corrective actions. A statement to that fact shall be
   placed in the body of the response letter. All letters shall be dated.
   A13.7.5. Corrective actions to separate violations shall not be commingled. Each violation
   shall be addressed separately. However, reference to a specific corrective action from
   another violation can made if such would resolve both violations.
A13.8. Rebuttal. If the Permittee believes a violation to be invalid, then a written rebuttal shall
be submitted to the RICS within 30 duty days of receipt of the violation. The rebuttal shall
include reasons for rebuttal and reference the permit, AFIs or Federal regulations as appropriate.
An unsupported opinion or supposition that corrective action is unattainable due to external
constraints may not be acceptable to close the matter.
A13.9. Disposition.
   A13.9.1. Closure. Upon receipt of a response to the violation from the Permittee, the RICS
   shall consider the merit of the corrective actions and, if satisfied, render a closure letter. A
   closure letter shall be submitted to the Permittee and copied, at a minimum, to their
   MAJCOM/SG and AFIA/SG.
   A13.9.2. Non-Closure. If the RIC/S determines corrective actions are not acceptable to
   close the violations, enforcement actions may be taken according to Attachment 14.
   Enforcement actions shall be submitted to the Permittee and copied, at a minimum, to their
   MAJCOM/SG and AFIA/SG.

                                         Attachment 14
                               RIC ENFORCEMENT POLICY

A14.1. Introduction and Basic Enforcement Actions. This section describes the enforcement
actions available to the RIC/S in the administration of the USAF MML, and specifies the
conditions under which each may be used. The basic enforcement actions are Notices of
Violation and Orders of various types. Enforcement action is usually taken whenever a violation
of permit requirements or regulations of more than a minor concern is identified. The nature and
extent of the enforcement action is intended to reflect the seriousness of the violation involved.
For the vast majority of violations, a Notice of Violation (NOV) is the usual action. NOVs are
sent to the Permittee, with copies to AFIA/SG (when not issued by AFIA), and MAJCOM
Bioenvironmental Engineer. They specify the nature of the violation(s) (e.g., permit condition,
permit tie-down, this instruction, or Federal regulations) and require a response for corrective
action by a set date. The RIC/S shall, in the administration of the MML, keep the assigned NRC
Program Manager informed regarding enforcement actions.
A14.2. Escalated Enforcement Actions, RIC and RIC Secretariat Directives. Whenever
inspections identify conditions or violations that result in significant regulatory concern,
escalated enforcement action through an issued directive is considered. As authorized by this
instruction and AFPD 40-2, a directive is a mandatory written order to modify, suspend, or to
cease and desist from a given practice or activity; or to take additional action as deemed
appropriate. Directives may be issued in lieu of, or in addition to NOVs, generally for Severity
Level I, II, or III violations or other conditions that cause significant regulatory concern.
Directives are mandatory and made effective immediately. Directives may be executed without
prior notice or consultation with the Permittee whenever it is determined that the public health,
interest, or safety requires, or when the order is responding to a violation involving willful
negligence. For other cases, the Permittee shall be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate why
the order should not be issued. Directives may be issued as follows:
   A14.2.1. Permit Modification. Permit Modification Orders are issued by the RIC/S when a
   change in Permittee equipment, procedures, personnel, or management controls is necessary.
   A14.2.2. Suspension Orders. Suspension Orders are issued by the RICS and signed by
   AF/SG3P and may apply to all or part of the permitted activity. Ordinarily, a permitted
   activity is not suspended (nor is a suspension prolonged) for failure to comply with
   requirements where such failure is not of willful intent and adequate corrective action has
   been taken. Suspension Orders may be used to remove a threat to the public health and
   safety, or the environment:
       A14.2.2.1. When the Permittee has not responded adequately to other enforcement
       action;
       A14.2.2.2. When the Permittee interferes with the conduct of an inspection or
       investigation; or
       A14.2.2.3. For any reason not mentioned above for which permit activity suspension is
       authorized by the RIC/S in coordination with AF/SG3P.
   A14.2.3. Revocation/Termination Orders.       Revocation/Termination Orders are issued by
   RIC/S and signed by AF/SG3P:
AFI40-201_90MWSUP_I 30 APRIL 2013                                                              113


      A14.2.3.1. When a Permittee is unable or unwilling to comply with permit requirements;
      A14.2.3.2. When a Permittee refuses to correct a violation;
   A14.2.3.3. When a Permittee does not respond to a NOV when a response was required by
   the RICS; or
      A14.2.3.4. For any other reason for which revocation is authorized by the RIC/S in
      coordination with AF/SG3P (i.e., any condition that would warrant refusal of a permit on
      an original application).
   A14.2.4. Cease and Desist Orders. Cease and Desist Orders are issued by the RIC/S and
   may be used to stop an unauthorized activity that continues after being notified by the RICS
   that the activity has been deemed unauthorized.
   A14.2.5. Confirmatory Action Letters. Confirmatory Action Letters are issued by the RICS
   confirming a Permittee’s agreement to take certain actions to eliminate significant concerns
   about health and safety, safeguards, or the environment.
   A14.2.6. Demands for Information. Demands for Information are mandated requests of
   information from Permittees or other persons for the purpose of enabling the RICS to
   determine whether an order or other enforcement action should be issued. Demands for
   Information may be issued by either the RIC or the RICS.
   A14.2.7. Other Orders. In addition to the Orders describe above, Orders may be issued to
   Permittees that include but are not limited to:
      A14.2.7.1. Divert facility financial resources to purchase, replace, or excess and dispose
      of certain equipment;
      A14.2.7.2. Increase the frequency of facility safety committee meetings;
      A14.2.7.3. Implement meetings between the facility executive management and the RSO
      on a frequent and routine basis;
      A14.2.7.4. Perform additional or supplemental training to Permittee staff;
      A14.2.7.5. Increase frequencies of facility internal audits or other internal surveillance;
      and/or
      A14.2.7.6. Appear before the RIC to present corrective actions and associated
      implementation timelines.
A14.3. Factors Impacting Escalated Enforcement Actions.
   A14.3.1. Initial Escalated Action: When the RIC/S is made aware of conditions or
   violations where escalated enforcement action may be necessary, deliberations are held to
   determine the severity level of the findings and factors that may affect that level. Serious
   findings will often include deliberations with the NRC. If it is established that a willful
   Severity Level III violation or problem has occurred, and the Permittee has not had any
   previous escalated actions (regardless of the activity area) during the past to (2) years or two
   (2) inspection cycles, whichever is longer, the RIC/S will consider whether the Permittee’s
   corrective action for the noted violation or problem is reasonably prompt and comprehensive.
   The starting point of this period shall be considered the date when the Permittee was put on
   notice to take corrective action.
114                                                 AFI40-201_90MWSUP_I 30 APRIL 2013


  A14.3.2. Credit for Actions Related to Identification: If a Severity Level I or II violation or
  a willful Severity Level III violation has occurred, or if, during the past two (2) years or two
  (2) inspection cycles, whichever is longer, and the Permittee has been issued at least one
  other escalated action, the escalated enforcement actions shall consider the factor of
  identification in addition to corrective action. The decision on identification requires
  considering all the circumstances of identification including:
      A14.3.2.1. Whether the problem requiring corrective action was AFIA/SG identified, the
      RICS-identified; Permittee-identified, or discovered through an event;
      A14.3.2.2. Whether prior opportunities existed to identify the problem requiring
      corrective action and if so, the age and number of those opportunities;
      A14.3.2.3. Whether the problem was discovered as the result of a Permittee’s self-
      monitoring effort, such as conducting an audit, a test, a surveillance, a design review, or
      troubleshooting;
      A14.3.2.4. For a problem discovered through an event, the ease of discovery, and the
      degree of Permittee initiative in identifying the root cause of the problem and any
      associated violations;
      A14.3.2.5. For AFIA/SG identified issues, whether the Permittee would have likely
      identified the issue in the same time-period if the Agency had not been involved;
      A14.3.2.6. For AFIA/SG identified issues, whether the Permittee should have identified
      the issue (and taken action) earlier; and
      A14.3.2.7. For cases in which AFIA/SG identifies the overall problem requiring
      corrective action (i.e., a programmatic issue), the degree of Permittee initiative or lack of
      initiative in identifying the problem or problems requiring corrective action.
  A14.3.3. Prompt and Comprehensive Corrective Action: Comprehensive corrective action is
  required for all MML violations. In most cases, The RICS does not propose escalated
  enforcement actions where the Permittee promptly identifies and comprehensively corrects
  violations. However, a Severity Level III violation or higher will almost always result in
  escalated enforcement actions if a Permittee does not take prompt and comprehensive
  corrective actions to address the violation. The following factors are considered:
      A14.3.3.1. Timeliness and Extent of Corrective Action.
         A14.3.3.1.1. Consideration will be given to the:
             A14.3.3.1.1.1. Timeliness of the corrective action (including the promptness in
             developing the schedule for long term corrective action);
             A14.3.3.1.1.2. Adequacy of the Permittee’s root cause analysis for the violation;
             and
             A14.3.3.1.1.3. Comprehensive nature of the corrective action (i.e., whether the
             action is focused narrowly to the specific violation or broadly to the general area
             of concern).
AFI40-201_90MWSUP_I 30 APRIL 2013                                                             115


          A14.3.3.1.2. Whether or not the Permittee has taken immediate actions necessary,
          upon discovery of a violation, that will restore safety, and return the permit to full
          compliance; and
          A14.3.3.1.3. Whether or not the Permittee has developed and implemented lasting
          actions that will not only prevent recurrence of the violation, but will be
          comprehensive enough, given the significance and complexity of the violation, to
          prevent occurrence of violations with similar root causes.
      A14.3.3.2. Adequacy of Corrective Actions. AFIA/SG will assist the RICS to determine
      adequacy of correction actions to violations. The RICS shall determine the adequacy of
      corrective actions to violations that are self-identified, result from an event, or are MML
      identified. The judgment of the adequacy of corrective actions may also occur at the time
      of an enforcement conference (i.e., by outlining substantive additional areas where
      corrective action is needed).
      A14.3.3.3. Corrective Action Process. The following shall be used for developing and
      implementing corrective actions. Corrective action shall be comprehensive enough to not
      only prevent recurrence of the violation at issue, but also to prevent occurrence of similar
      violations. These items should help in focusing broad corrective actions to the general
      area of concern rather than to specific violations. The actions that need to be taken are
      dependent on the facts and circumstances of the particular case. The corrective action
      process should involve the following steps:
          A14.3.3.3.1. Conduct a complete and thorough review of the circumstances that led
          to the violation;
          A14.3.3.3.2. Identify the root cause of the violation; and
          A14.3.3.3.3. Take prompt and comprehensive corrective action that will address the
          immediate concerns and prevent recurrence of the violation.
A14.4. Enforcement Conferences.
   A14.4.1. When a Permittee has been issued a NOV and fails to conform to effective
   corrective actions, the RIC/S may decide to initiate an enforcement conference with the
   Permittee to define the actions necessary to begin effective corrective measures to the
   violation. The RIC/S will issue official correspondence to the Permittee informing them of
   the enforcement conference. The enforcement conference can be implemented by any
   necessary means to affect a productive dialogue between the Permittee, the RIC/S.
   A14.4.2. The purpose of the conference is for the RIC/S to gather the necessary facts and
   information from the Permittee in order to make an informed decision about the violation.
   Objectives of the conference will include determining:
      A14.4.2.1. The root cause and analysis of the violation(s);
      A14.4.2.2. That a Permittee’s response is deemed timely and appropriate; and
      A14.4.2.3. That corrective actions to prevent similar recurrence of the violation(s) have
      been taken.
 116                                                   AFI40-201_90MWSUP_I 30 APRIL 2013


   A14.4.3. Results of the enforcement conference will be formalized by the RICS with
   correspondence to the Permittee describing the actions the Permittee must perform to resolve
   the violation(s).
A14.5. Appealing Enforcement Actions. The Permittee or any other person adversely affected
by a NOV or Order may appeal said action. The Permittee may submit an appeal via official
correspondence to the RIC/S for the violations and findings. The Permittee must provide ample
regulatory justification in the correspondence to warrant an appeal of the violations. The RIC/S
shall review the appeal by the Permittee and decide actions to be taken based on the merit of the
request, corrective actions taken by the Permittee, and the severity levels of the violations. The
RIC/S may at its option, initiate a review of Permittee program operations concerning the
enforcement action, grant the appeal to mitigate the severity level of the violation and/or
enforcement actions, or deny the appeal.
A14.6. NRC Related Administrative Actions. In addition to the enforcement actions by the
RIC/S, the NRC also uses administrative actions, such as Notices of Violation, Notice of
Deviation, Notices of Nonconformance, Confirmatory Action Letters, Letters of Reprimand, and
Demands for Information to supplement its enforcement program. The NRC may issue orders
and impose civil penalties for violations of NRC regulations and MML conditions. Note that any
notice of violation involving radiological working conditions, proposed imposition of civil
penalty, or order issued and any response must be posted by the Permittee IAW 10 CFR
19.11(a)(4).
   A14.6.1. Civil Penalty. Only the NRC may impose civil penalties. A civil penalty is a
   monetary penalty that may be imposed by the NRC for violation of certain specified
   licensing provisions of the Atomic Energy Act or supplementary NRC rules or orders, any
   requirement for which a MML permit or NRC license may be revoked, reporting
   requirements under Section 206 of the Energy Reorganization Act, and NRC Regulations and
   MML program conditions. If the application of the normal guidance in this policy does not
   result in an appropriate sanction, as warranted, then the NRC may apply its full enforcement
   authority where the action is warranted. NRC action may include civil penalties, issuing
   appropriate orders, and assessing civil penalties for continuing violations on a per day basis,
   up to the NRC limit per violation.
   A14.6.2. Mitigation of Enforcement Actions. The NRC may exercise discretion and refrain
   from enforcement action, if the outcome of the normal process described in this policy does
   not result in a sanction consistent with an appropriate regulatory message. In addition, even
   if the NRC exercises this discretion, when the Permittee failed to make a required report to
   AFIA/SG or the RIC/S, a separate enforcement action may be issued for the Permittee’s
   failure to make a required report.
A14.7. Enforcement Actions Involving Individuals. An enforcement action against an
individual will be taken only when the RIC/S is satisfied that the individual fully understood, or
should have understood, his or her responsibility; knew, or should have known, the required
actions; and knowingly, or with careless disregard (i.e., with more than mere negligence) failed
to take required actions which have actual or potential safety significance. Transgressions of
individuals at the level of Severity Level III or IV violations will be handled by citing the facility
Permittee with a requirement that specific actions concerning the individual be taken.
AFI40-201_90MWSUP_I 30 APRIL 2013                                                               117


   A14.7.1. Management Failures. Action against an individual will not be taken if it
   demonstrates that the improper action by the individual was caused by management failures.
   The following are examples of situations to illustrate this concept but do not represent all
   potential cases:
       A14.7.1.1. Inadvertent individual mistakes resulting from inadequate training or
       guidance provided by the Permittee;
       A14.7.1.2. Inadvertently missing an insignificant procedural requirement when the
       action is routine, fairly uncomplicated, and there is no unusual circumstance indicating
       that the procedures should be referred to and followed step-by-step;
       A14.7.1.3. Compliance with an express direction of management that resulted in a
       violation unless the individual did not express his or her concern or objection to the
       direction; or
       A14.7.1.4. Individual error directly resulting from following the technical advice of an
       expert (e.g., advisor or subcontractor) unless the advice was clearly unreasonable and the
       permitted individual should have recognized it as such.
A14.8. Willful Violations and Actions of Individuals. If the actions described in these
examples are taken by Permittee authorized individuals or otherwise taken deliberately by an
individual working under permitted activities. The RICS will promptly report all suspected
deliberate violations of NRC requirements to NRC Region IV office. RIC enforcement action
may consist of requiring actions be taken directly toward the individual. The RIC may address
immediate and ongoing safety issues as well as initiate an investigation into suspected deliberate
violations unless directed otherwise by the NRC. Listed below are examples of situations that
could result in enforcement actions against individuals.
   A14.8.1. The situations include, but are not limited to, violations that involve:
       A14.8.1.1. Willfully causing a Permittee to be in violation of permit requirements;
       A14.8.1.2. Willfully taking action that would have caused a Permittee to be in violation
       of requirements but the consequence(s) of the action did not occur because it was
       detected and corrective action was taken;
       A14.8.1.3. Recognizing a violation of procedural requirements and willfully not taking
       corrective action.
       A14.8.1.4. Willfully defeating alarms and/or interlocks that have safety significance;
       A14.8.1.5. Dereliction of duty;
       A14.8.1.6. Falsifying records required by MML requirements or by the Permittee;
       A14.8.1.7. Willfully providing, or causing a Permittee to provide, an Inspection Agency
       inspector with inaccurate or incomplete information on a matter material to the radiation
       protection program; or
       A14.8.1.8. Willfully withholding safety significant information rather than making such
       information known and available to appropriate supervisory or technical personnel in the
       Permittee’s organization.
 118                                                 AFI40-201_90MWSUP_I 30 APRIL 2013


   A14.8.2. Factors in Deciding Enforcement Actions: In its determination of whether to issue
   requirements that actions be taken concerning an individual, the following factors will be
   considered:
       A14.8.2.1. The level of the individual within the organization;
       A14.8.2.2. The individual’s training and experience as well as knowledge of the
       potential consequences of the misconduct;
       A14.8.2.3. The safety consequences of the misconduct;
       A14.8.2.4. The degree of supervision of the individual, i.e., how closely is the individual
       monitored or audited and the likelihood of detection;
       A14.8.2.5. The employer’s response, (e.g., disciplinary action taken);
       A14.8.2.6. The attitude of the offender (e.g., admission of misconduct, acceptance of
       responsibility);
       A14.8.2.7. The degree of management responsibility or culpability; and
       A14.8.2.8. Who identified the misconduct.
   A14.8.3. Types of Enforcement Actions: Any proposed enforcement action against
   individuals must be issued by the RIC/S. The particular sanction to be used should be
   determined on a case-by-case basis. Notices of Violation and Orders are examples of
   enforcement actions that may be appropriate involving individuals. Orders involving
   individuals might include provisions that would:
       A14.8.3.1. Prohibit involvement in MML permitted activities for a specified period of
       time (normally the period of suspension would not exceed five (5) years) or indefinitely
       until certain conditions are satisfied (e.g., completing specified training or meeting
       certain qualifications); or
       A14.8.3.2. Require retraining, additional oversight or independent verification of
       activities performed by the person, if the person is to be involved in permitted activities.
   A14.8.4. Disciplinary Enforcement. Adverse personnel actions and other disciplinary
   actions are the responsibility of the organization to which the individual to be disciplined
   belongs. Discretion may be exercised by either escalating or mitigating enforcement action
   to ensure that the proposed enforcement action reflects the Inspection Agency and the RICS
   concerns regarding the violation(s) at issue and that it conveys the appropriate message to the
   Permittee.
A14.9. Violations of Reporting Requirements or Submitting False Information.
   A14.9.1. Reporting: Permittees are expected to provide complete, accurate, and timely
   information and reports when required. A Permittee will not usually be cited for a failure to
   report a condition or event unless the Permittee was actually aware of the condition or event
   that it failed to report. A Permittee will, on the other hand, usually be cited for a failure to
   report a condition or event if the Permittee knew of the information to be reported, but did
   not recognize the reporting requirements.
AFI40-201_90MWSUP_I 30 APRIL 2013                                                           119


  A14.9.2. Inaccurate and Incomplete Information: A violation of MML requirements
  involving submittal of incomplete and/or inaccurate information can result in the full range
  of enforcement actions.
     A14.9.2.1. Identification of false information. The labeling of a communication failure
     as a material false statement will be made on a case-by-case basis and will be reserved for
     egregious violations. Violations involving inaccurate or incomplete information or the
     failure to provide significant information identified by a Permittee will be categorized
     based on:
         A14.9.2.1.1. The degree of knowledge that the communicator should have had,
         regarding the matter, in view of his or her position, training, and experience;
         A14.9.2.1.2. The opportunity and time available prior to the communication to assure
         the accuracy or completeness of the information;
         A14.9.2.1.3. The degree of intent or negligence, if any, involved;
         A14.9.2.1.4. The formality of the communication;
         A14.9.2.1.5. The importance of the information which was wrong or not provided;
         A14.9.2.1.6. The rationale of the explanation for not providing complete and
         accurate information;
         A14.9.2.1.7. Efforts taken to correct information that is later identified as false or

                               MANAGING ALLEGATIONS

A15.1. Introduction. All Permittee employees are required to be aware of NRC Form 3, Notice
to Employees, which must be posted for all employees to view, and their right to make an
allegation. Allegations will be investigated and reported IAW NRC Management Directive 8.8,
Management of Allegations. It is the responsibility of employees to immediately identify
conditions contrary to this and to work within an organization’s resources to obtain corrective
action. If such cannot be accomplished due to a threatening environment, limitation of resources
or unwillingness of management, an allegation can be made at any level, anytime, among the
following hierarchy:
   A15.1.1. Supervisors;
   A15.1.2. PRSOs or IRSOs;
   A15.1.3. Commanders;
   A15.1.4. Inspector General;
   A15.1.5. USAF Radioisotope Committee Secretariat;
   A15.1.6. USAF Radioisotope Committee;
   A15.1.7. US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Although it is customary, and encouraged,
   for employees to use their supervisory chain to seek expedient resolution of problems at the
   lowest level, this is not mandatory. Anonymous allegations can be made; however,
   resolution may be impacted by quality of information received.
A15.2. Reporting Allegations.
   A15.2.1. Allegations containing the following information can be processed most
   effectively.
       A15.2.1.1. Name, occupation and contact information of person making the allegation;
       A15.2.1.2. Date and description of issue;
       A15.2.1.3. Individuals involved and witnesses;
       A15.2.1.4. Outcome and Consequences;
       A15.2.1.5. Details of previous reports, including who received them.
       A15.2.1.6. Any corrective actions to date; and
       A15.2.1.7. Expectations.
A15.3. RICS Handling of Allegations.
   A15.3.1. In the event the RICS receives an allegation, the following measures will be taken:
       A15.3.1.1. If the allegation is against the RICS, it will be immediately referred to the
       appropriate NRC Regional Office for disposition and AF/SG3 shall be informed.
       A15.3.1.2. If the allegation is not against the RICS, the appropriate NRC Regional
       Office will be notified. A brief written report, provided by the individual making the
AFI40-201_90MWSUP_I 30 APRIL 2013                                                                121


       allegation will be forwarded to AFMSA/SG3PB for review and determination of the main
       merits of investigating the allegation. The allegation will then be presented to the Chief,
       RICS, and, if deemed necessary, an Allegation Review Board (ARB) will be formed to
       conduct an investigation.
   A15.3.2. The ARB will be comprised of the following representatives:
       A15.3.2.1. Chair, RIC (will serve as the Chair, ARB);
       A15.3.2.2. Chief, RICS;
       A15.3.2.3. Member of the          affected   MAJCOM,       Senior   Health    Physicist    or
       Bioenvironmental Engineer;
       A15.3.2.4. AFIA/SGI;
       A15.3.2.5. Officer within of the affected unit; and
       A15.3.2.6. RIC/JA
   A15.3.3. The ARB should document the allegation investigation in an inspection report. It
   is important that the inspection reports protect the identity of the individual(s) making the
   allegation(s) and not provide any information in the report that may reveal his/her identity.
   The inspection report should not contain any detailed information of the inspection that
   would correlate the inspection to an allegation. The inspection report findings should be
   included in the allegation file for the respective allegation case for final resolution by the
   RIC.
   A15.3.4. Once determined adequate by the RIC/JA, the ARB will provide a final allegation
   investigation report and recommended course(s) of action to the RIC. An allegation
   involving a health or safety issue will have a higher priority.
   A15.3.5. All suspected deliberate violations of NRC requirements involving immediate and
   ongoing safety issues will be reported to the appropriate NRC Regional Office for disposition
   by the RIC. Concurrently, an immediate investigation may be conducted by the supervisors;
   PRSOs or IRSOs; Commanders; Inspector General; RICS; RIC; or ARB, as appropriate.
A15.4. Protecting the Identity of Individuals Making Allegations. The name of the
individual(s) making the allegation(s) and other identifying information which could potentially
identify the individual(s) will not be used in discussions of allegations or documents released to
the Permittee or members of the public related to the allegation. The identity of the individual(s)
will be protected, and the Inspection Agency will not advise a Permittee that an inspection is
based on an allegation. Exceptions to this policy include:
   A15.4.1. The circumstance where the individual has no objection to the release of his/her
   identity and is documented in the allegation file;
   A15.4.2. Communications within and between the RIC, RIC Secretariat, the NRC, the AF
   Inspection Agency, and other parties that require knowledge of this identity to properly
   manage the allegation; or
   A15.4.3. The circumstance where such protection would impact worker health and safety.
A15.5. Maintenance of Allegation Files. The RICS maintains the official file of all
information pertaining to each allegation. It is important that the RICS and RIC members assure

there is no unauthorized reproduction of information related to an allegation. Copies of
allegation files may be made following approval by the AFMSA/SG3P case representative. All
copies made of an allegation file must be returned to the file or destroyed. These files must be
maintained in a manner that is consistent with the Privacy Act.
A15.6. Allegation Information in Inspection Reports. The investigation into the allegation
should be documented in an inspection report. It is important that the inspection reports protects
the identity of the individual(s) making the allegation(s) and not provide any information in the
report that may reveal his/her identity. The inspection report should not contain any detailed
information of the inspection that would correlate the inspection to an allegation. The inspection
report findings should be included in the allegation file for the respective allegation case for final
resolution by the RIC.
A15.7. Resolution of Allegations. The RIC will review all allegations received. Once all of
the necessary information related to the allegation has been collected, the RIC will review the
allegation file to determine if any further actions are required before a final decision is made. If
any findings of an allegation investigation are in violation of the regulations, then the severity
level of the violation will determine the response by the RIC to the command as described in the
Enforcement Policy, Attachment 14.
A15.8. Allegation Close-Out Report. Once the final disposition of an allegation is approved
by the RIC, a formal response and close-out report of the RIC findings will be forwarded to the
individual(s) who made the allegation by the RICS. If the individual(s) does/do not agree with
the findings of the RIC, then the individual(s) may appeal the findings of the RIC with any
additional information necessary to support the appeal of the final allegation findings.
A15.9. Allegation to the NRC. Nothing in this attachment prevents an individual from making
an allegation directly to the NRC, particularly as it pertains to allegations levied against the
RICS. The AF IG can provide assistance.
