This supplement expands the guidance provided in the Air Force Instruction (AFI) 10-206 to
support the reporting requirements of HQ AFMC. It is applicable to all AFMC units. This
publication does not apply to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Units and to the Air
National Guard (ANG). This publication can be supplemented at field/unit level and must be
published as a stand- alone. It is mandatory that all AFMC units submit reports that apply to any
AFMC rule number listed below. Commanders should use sound judgment in the information
initially reported to expedite submission of the report.            Submitting a report for all
events/incidents covered in the Commander Critical Information Requirements (CCIR) matrix is
not optional. Events/incidents are considered to be of interest to the MAJCOM if they are in this
matrix and thus reporting is mandatory. This document is substantially revised and must be
completely reviewed. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using Air Force (AF) Form 847, Recommendation for
Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through HQ AFMC/A3XP, 4225
Logistics Ave RM A023, WPAFB, OH 45433-5750. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual
(AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force
Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This
supplement expands on the instructions provided in the basic AFI for the performance of CCIR
in AFMC. Major changes include: removing AFMC OPREP-3 Homeline reports from the AF
OPREP-3 reporting system; implementing AFMC CCIR’s in place of prior MAJCOM-Level
reporting as well as proposing that CCIR’s be submitted primarily via SIPRNET Email; dividing
the Reports Guidebook into two books; and establishing new guidance on Commander/First
Sergeant OPREP training.
1.1.2.1. (Added) Command Reporting Responsibilities. All AFMC organizations, to include
Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) and Federally Funded Research Development Centers
(FFRDCs) accountable under HQ AFMC, will establish procedures to ensure the nearest AFMC
unit command post is made aware of all events/incidents occurring on their facilities or affecting
their programs which fall under AFMC CCIR reporting criteria and/or merit HQ AFMC
attention. After the initial report is sent, the unit that reported the incident will then notify the
owning command post to ensure timely reporting. Additionally, all AFMC organizations that
account for any GSU’s and/or FFRDC’s will ensure that these agencies are aware of the
reporting requirements held within this AFI supplement.
1.1.2.1.1. (Added) AFMC CCIR: Purpose. The AFMC CCIR, which replaced the OPREP-3
HOMELINE reports, is any incident or activity occurring within AFMC that is considered of
high interest/value to AFMC senior leaders, but is not reportable under AF OPREP-3 BEELINE
and PINNACLE reporting criteria.
1.1.2.2. (Added) Specific Reporting Instructions. The AFMC CCIR matrix lists the
mandatory reports that must be submitted and will be located in the controller information file.
Unit commanders are not restricted to reporting only these items listed within the matrix and
may report any incident/activity they deem of high interest/value to AFMC senior leaders.
1.1.3.1. (Added) AFMC installation command posts will ensure they use the correct
MAJCOM AFI 10-206 supplement when reporting CCIR reports and ensure the AFMC
Command Center is an info addressee on all non-AFMC reports.
1.2.3.2.1. (Added) AFMC A3XP will review and validate the CCIR Matrix annually.
1.2.3.3. (Added) AFMC CCIR: The AFMC A3XP will coordinate, develop and provide an
AFMC CCIR matrix to ensure that information concerning events/incidents that do not meet AF
OPREP-3 PINNACLE or BEELINE reporting requirements is still available to the AFMC
Commander in the form of a CCIR report.
1.2.3.4. (Added) Distribution: The AFMC Command Center will receive AFMC CCIR and
distribute via SIPRNET email to the applicable distribution list in accordance with AFMC Senior
Leader directives.
1.3.7. (Added) Command Responsibilities. AFMC Commanders will ensure all commanders
and First Sergeants in units under their command have been briefed and trained on OPREP-3 and
AFMC CCIR reporting criteria initially and semi-annually or as significant changes have
occurred.
1.4.1.1.1. (Added) The Command Post (CP) NCOIC of Reports and designated alternate(s)
will be trained, and are responsible for training all CP controllers (initial, recurring, refresher), on
AFI10-206_AFMCSUP 14 JUNE 2012                                                                   3


operational reporting criteria IAW AFI 10-207 Command Posts and the Air Force 1C3 Master
Training Plan.
1.4.2.1. (Added) AF OPREP-3 training will be conducted by the CP NCOIC of Reports
including Squadron Commanders and First Sergeants (including tenant unit commanders).
Initial training for releasing officials will be done in person and semi-annual refresher training
can be done electronically. GSU’s can conduct VTC training, telephonic, or electronic training.
All training documentation will be maintained in Part five of Reports Guidebook One.
1.4.5.1. (Added) AFMC installation CPs will thoroughly brief tenant unit commanders on all
reporting criteria and procedures outlined in AFI 10-206 and applicable MAJCOM Supplements.
The installation command post will coordinate OPREP-3 and AFMC CCIR reporting
requirements/criteria with tenants and lateral agencies such as security forces, maintenance
operations, and medical, to ensure all events/incidents are quickly brought to the attention of the
CP. Organizations will provide CPs with required OPREP-3 and AFMC CCIR information to
ensure HHQ channels are informed.
1.4.5.2. (Added) AFMC Installations that operate with more than one MAJCOM will ensure
that support is equal for all commands. As required by AFI 10-206, Para. 1.1.3., a Host Tenant
Support Agreement (HTSA), and/or Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), between host and
tenant wings, will be in place (until superseded by a new host and/or tenant leadership, or when
new details require the drafting of a new MOA) and will be reviewed annually for accuracy. The
review will be documented on a “Record of Review” and filed in front of the reviewed
documents.
1.4.9.1. (Added) AFMC Command Center will be addressed on all OPREP-3/AFMC CCIR
asynchronous/record copy reports submitted regardless of the Command the report pertains to
along with all other required minimum essential addressees. The AFMC Command Center will
forward the OPREP-3/CCIR reports directly to AFMC/CC applicable directorates, and other
offices as directed.
2.1.1.9. (Added) Classification. At a minimum, an AFMC CCIR is classified For Official Use
Only (FOUO). However, FOUO reports may contain sensitive information requiring Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and/or Sexual Assault Response Program
privileges. All unclassified and classified AFMC CCIR reports will be distributed on a “need to
know” basis. Reports will not be forwarded unless mission essential; if classified; the recipients
clearance will be verified prior to transmission.
2.5.1. (Added) AFMC units will maintain electronic copies of all transmitted AF OPREP-3
and CCIR reports which will be maintained for one calendar year, IAW AF RDS, T 10-10R
04.00, Controller Training Records Event/Incident Reports.
3.3.5. (Added) A second Guidebook containing Reports information will be maintained along
with the Guidebook identified in AFI 10-206, paragraph 3.3. These guidebooks will be properly
labeled as “Reports Guidebook One” and “Reports Guidebook Two”. Both Guidebooks will be
stored together in the console area for quick reference.
3.3.5.1. (Added) The NCOIC of Reports will update the Reports Guidebooks as necessary and
will document the review of these Guidebooks annually on a “Record of Review” page. The
"Record of Review" page will be kept in the front of Reports Guidebook One.

3.5.2.1. (Added) Exercise Reports. Exercise voice and record copy reports will only be up-
channeled if directed by the exercise plan, evaluator, or when prior coordination has occurred.
3.5.3.1. (Added) Synchronous Reports. AFMC Command Center controllers will screen all
FOLUP and FINAL reports against reporting criteria/requirements outlined in the separate AFI
10-206 OPREP-3 Matrix and AFMC CCIR Matrix of this supplement upon receipt of voice and
record copy reports. If the FOLUP report no longer meets OPREP-3 or AFMC CCIR reporting
requirements, ensure the unit sends the report as a final. The AFMC Command Center will notify
AFI10-206_AFMCSUP 14 JUNE 2012                                                                   5


the unit if it meets higher level reporting requirements and the unit will readdress the
commander.
3.5.4. (Added) Synchronous/Voice Notifications (Jabber). All AFMC units will accomplish
synchronous/voice notification to the AFMC Command Center via Jabber (afmc command
center). All AFMC CCIR notifications must be accomplished within 15 minutes of Command
Post notification. Units will not delay CCIR notifications to obtain further information.
3.6.8. (Added) Asynchronous/Record         Notifications. Units   will   transmit   CCIR
asynchronous/record copy reports to the AFMC Command Center via SIPR e-mail within 1 hour
of the Jabber notification. Asynchronous reports will mirror the OPREP-3 B/P, non-USMTF
format.
3.6.8.1. (Added) Do not delay submitting an initial report if a cost estimate is not available.
Submit a follow-up or final report once the estimates become available.
3.6.9. (Added) Report Delays / Extension Requests: It is highly advised that units do not
delay asynchronous reporting to obtain additional information. However, when it is known that
the asynchronous/record-copy report will be transmitted more than 1 hour after the associated
Synchronous/Voice Notifications (Jabber), contact the AFMC Command Center immediately
with the reason(s) and an estimated time of report transmittal. If the reason(s) for the delay is a
computer/system problem, the reports will be submitted through secure voice procedures.
3.6.10. (Added) AFMC CCIR Follow-up/Final Reports. If FOLUP information is unavailable
within seven days of the initial AFMC CCIR, controllers will request to the releasing authority to
send a FINAL AFMC CCIR report to the AFMC Command Center with the statement “No
Further information will be made available through Command Post channels. Further
information will be available through (identify the reporting office symbol), POC: DSN XXX-
XXXX Comm. XXX-XXX-XXXX.”
(Added) IMPORTANT NOTE: AFMC CCIR Reports will adhere to the Appropriate /
Inappropriate Report Content requirements outlined in paragraphs/subparagraphs 3.8.-
3.9. of AFI 10-206.
3.8.1.1. (Added)     The     OPREP-3/AFMC      CCIR        will    clearly          state     what
squadron/group/wing/base and MAJCOM the individual/asset is assigned to.
Examples: A 33 year old female from the 795th Civil Engineering Squadron, 95th Mission
Support Group, 95th Air Base Wing, Edwards AFB, Air Force Materiel Command was charged
with theft.
3.8.7.1. (Added) Condolence Letters. Condolence letters will be submitted for all reported
Active Duty Military and Government Civilian (GS, SES, etc.) Deaths occurring within AFMC,
with exception to contractors (applies to both General and DoD "Advisory & Assistance”
Contractors). All AFMC/CP’s will submit condolence letter information worksheets to the HQ
AFMC/HC organizational box no later than 24 hours after the initial report has been submitted.
(See Figure 3.1 for a sample Condolence Letter Information Worksheet).

Figure 3.1. (Added) AFMC Condolence Letter Information Format Example




3.10.1.1. (Added) Corrected/FOLUP/Final reports will be sent by SIPR e-mail, contain the
previous reports in order, and be in sentence case. The first line of the corrected report will state
“Correction to CCIR DDMMHHZMMMYYYY report”. FOLUP/Final reports will contain
required information not previously reported and submitted via SIPR e-mail.
3.10.4.1. (Added) Correction of Reports. When an AFMC CCIR report with relevant errors
(not cosmetic) has been identified, a corrected AFMC CCIR report will be voiced using Jabber
and transmitted via SIPR e-mail. To ease the processes of identifying what corrections are being
made, only add the information that has been changed in the correction reports.
3.10.5.5.1. (Added) AFMC CCIR reports will mirror the subject line of the AF OPREP subject
line example within AFI 10-206, Figure 3.1. CCIR, 101034ZDEC2011, 72 ABW, Tinker AFB,
OK, IG Team Arrival, Rule 3F.
3.10.6.5.1. (Added) If questions posed by the AFSWC or AFMC Command Center cannot be
answered in a reasonable amount of time, and the information no longer requires the immediacy
of the OPREP-3 system, transmit a final report in accordance with AFI 10-206, paragraph 3.6.7.
3.10.6.6.1. (Added) Do not add AFMC CCIR rule numbers to an AF OPREP report. The
commander will designate whether or not the lower level report is necessary.

3.10.6.7.1. (Added) Upgrading CCIR’s. If a CCIR gets upgraded to meet AF OPREP-3
Beeline or Pinnacle reporting criteria, CPs will immediately report the CCIR as an Initial AF
OPREP-3. This will close out the CCIR.
3.10.6.7.2. (Added) Downgrading Reports. The highest command that received the initial
voice report will make the determination to downgrade or cancel the OPREP-3 report. If the
initial hard copy has already been sent, send the initial downgraded report to the same addresses
on the higher level report. No voice report will be required, unless directed by HHQ. Within the
text of the message, state the office symbol that authorized the downgraded report. After the
initial report, follow-up reports will be sent to the downgraded addresses.
3.11.3. (Added) If Jabber is out, the unit command post will use secure telephone voice
procedures to notify the AFMC Command Center of an AFMC CCIR report. The unit will then
transmit the Asynchronous/Record Notification in accordance with paragraph 3.6.8.
3.11.4. (Added) If there is a complete outage of SIPR the unit command post will voice the
AFMC CCIR report using secure telephone voice procedures. Upon system return, wing/unit will
transmit all reports submitted during the outage using the Asynchronous/Record Notification
procedures outlined in paragraph 3.6.8.
3.12.5. (Added) The OPREP template formats are mandatory for the AFMC CCIR reports and
can be found on the Air Force Command Post Career Field CoP website.
3.13.1. (Added) Under Rule 3E, report the status of all Tier 1 and Tier 2 Air Force Critical
Assets whenever there is any unscheduled operational interruption resulting in mission impact
categorized as failure or severe degradation. Include the cause of the interruption (i.e.,
intentional/hostile activity, natural disaster, or accident), specific mission impact (i.e., failure,
severe degradation) and estimated time to recover capability. IAW DoDI 3020.45, Defense
Critical Infrastructure Program (DCIP) Management and AFPD 10-24, Air Force Critical
Infrastructure Program.
3.15. (Added) AFMC Network Outage Impact / Network Outage Mission Impact:
3.15.1. (Added) Description:
3.15.1.1. (Added) Network Outage Impact: An ATO/IATO (Authority to Operate/Interim
Authority to Operate) expiration or potential outage of either NIPRNET/SIPRNET/Joint
Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) for a period greater than 4 hours. All
FOLUP/FINAL AFMC CCIR/SITREP (Situation Report) reports should build on previous
reports. Duplicating or including information to fill in the blank is not desirable. Brevity is
paramount. (See NOTES 1 through 4)
3.15.1.1.1. (Added) Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) supports
the production and dissemination of intelligence for indications and warnings, current
intelligence, crisis management, operations planning and coordination and other activities.
3.15.1.2. (Added) Network Outage Mission Impact: Any anticipated/planned outage based
on certificate cancellation or system software upgrade that may cause the loss of either the
NIPRNET/SIPRNET/JWICS for a period greater than 4 hours. (See NOTES 3 & 4)


IMPORTANT NOTE: Any FOLUP/FINAL reports should outline any changes or new

information in the fashion of one the following BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front) statement
examples (Figure 4.2.).
Note 1: Initial AFMC CCIR must be sent to HQ AFMC 30 days prior to ATO/IATO expiration
or if there is a potential outage of either net for period greater than 4 hours.
Note 2: FOLUP AFMC CCIR must be sent HQ AFMC 48 hours prior to ATO/IATO expiration
or if there is a potential outage of either net for period greater than 4 hours. Weekly FOLUP
AFMC SITREP reports must be submitted until a new ATO/IATO is signed. If there is no
information to report, then enter the phrase: ―Nothing Significant to Report (NSTR).
Note 3: Wing Commander (or equivalent) will categorize mission impact as
LOW/MODERATE/SEVERE, must send an AFMC CCIR if the event meets any of these
guidelines:
LOW: Loss limited to e-mail, AF Portal (Leaveweb, vMPF, DTS, etc) or Office related activity
which did not have direct impact on mission essential/critical items. Reasonable manual
workarounds are available. Total mission impact estimated <$200K.
MODERATE: Essential/critical mission capability degraded. Non-critical path causing
sortie/test cancellation. Manual workarounds are feasible, but require significant effort. Causing
a significant delay in an ACAT-II or below program. Total mission impact estimated >$200K
but less than $1M.
SEVERE: Loss of essential/critical mission capability. Critical path sortie or test cancellation.
Manual workarounds are unavailable or infeasible. Significant delay in an ACAT-I program.
Total mission impact estimated $1M or greater.
Note 4: (As outlined in Para. 4.9.1.) A SITREP will be reported using the Non-USMTF format
example in Figure 4.1.

4.1.6. (Added) AFMC Contingency Operations Commander’s Situation Report
(SITREP): IMPORTANT NOTE: The Installation Commander, CAT and Command Post all
have a responsibility in the timely and accurate reporting of SITREP’s. However, Commander
SITREP’s will only be sent out via the Command Post.
4.1.6.1. (Added) During peace time and contingency situations, each AFMC subordinate
organization’s Crisis Action Team (CAT) will prepare and send a periodic Commander’s
Situation Report through the command post (frequency and deadline to be specified by HQ
AFMC) to the HQ AFMC CAT, commencing at the direction of the HQ AFMC BSD (Battle
Staff Directive) (see CJCSM 3150.14, Joint Reporting Structure [JRS] Logistics). It is each
Crisis Action Team’s responsibility to gather information required, assisting the command post
as they prepare and submit each report. Subordinate unit SITREP’s may be signed by their
respective CAT Director or designated alternate.
4.4.1. (Added) Unless otherwise directed by the HQ AFMC CAT Director, send SITREPs
through the command post to arrive at HQ AFMC CAT Team not later than 2300Z daily. The
unit SITREP will cover events/incidents that occur from 2000Z-1959Z. Send the most current
information available with the “as of” time on the SITREP. Actual information that is several
hours old due to compilation times is acceptable if it is the latest information available within the
reporting timeline.
4.6.3. (Added) Report content should highlight key activities and build on previous reports.
Duplicating or including information to fill in the blank is not desirable. Brevity is paramount.
After the initial SITREP is submitted, only include added or changed items on subsequent
AFI10-206_AFMCSUP 14 JUNE 2012                                                                 9


SITREPs. If there is no information to report, then enter the phrase: ―Nothing Significant to
Report (NSTR).
4.7.10. (Added) In addition to the report content identified in AFI 10-206 paragraphs 4.7.1
through 4.7.9.1.7, the SITREP will also contain the following (but not be limited to):
4.7.10.1. (Added) Operational problems and limitations
4.7.10.2. (Added) Requests for assistance.
4.7.10.3. (Added) Recommended or intended courses of action.
4.7.10.4. (Added) Unit readiness.
4.7.10.5. (Added) Event/Incident Report (OPREP-3/AFMC CCIR) follow-up reporting when
the immediacy of an OPREP-3/AFMC CCIR report is no longer needed.
4.7.10.6. (Added) Information not reported elsewhere.
4.7.10.7. (Added) Public affairs.
4.7.10.8. (Added) Any other information required by HQ or AFMC supported commands.
4.7.10.9. (Added) While the HQ Crisis Action Team Director (CAT) may require special
SITREP sections depending on the contingency, Center CAT Directors’ must include all
important contingency support information in their SITREP.
4.7.11. (Added) Due to AFMC’s mission diversity and complex organizational structure, one
or more sections may not apply to every operation. Similarly, even when sections do apply,
there may be nothing significant to report (NSTR) on some sections at the time the SITREP is
submitted. In these cases, retain the SITREP format, including subject titles, but include only
applicable subjects in the report. Use “N/A” or NSTR where appropriate.
4.7.12. (Added) HQ AFMC/A3X is the HQ AFMC OPR for Situation Report formats. For the
most current SITREP format, contact A3X at DSN 787-7900 (when Crisis Action Team is
