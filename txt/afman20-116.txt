                                    PROPULSION SAFETY

2.1. Overview. The DoP and the air vehicle PM shall together implement a planned, integrated,
and comprehensive propulsion safety effort that complies with the requirements in DoDI
5000.02, AFI 63-101/20-101 and AFI 91-202. Section 2.2 describes the use of the system safety
methodology in MIL-STD-882 as tailored by propulsion-specific guidance, criteria, and
procedures. Section 2.3 describes the additional safety management tasks executed by the DoP.
Propulsion safety efforts contribute to the overall operational safety, suitability, and effectiveness
of air vehicle systems.
2.2. Propulsion-specific System Safety Implementation Requirements. This section defines
relationships between the two communities (propulsion systems and the aircraft systems) in
executing the system safety methodology for propulsion systems. It implements the
requirements in DoDI 5000.02, AFI 63-101/20-101, and AFI 91-202 for program offices to use
the system safety methodology in MIL-STD-882 to integrate safety, occupational health, and
environmental risk management into the systems engineering process. It does not summarize or
repeat all of the system safety requirements from those referenced documents. The DoP has
provided supplemental procedures and criteria included in this publication to tailor that
methodology for propulsion systems. The additional use of engine-specific quantitative
probability criteria, i.e. non-recoverable in flight shutdown and engine related loss of aircraft
(correlating to uncontained failures, fires, or total loss of thrust), provides a basis for more
detailed risk assessment and comparison.
   2.2.1. The DoP shall ensure Engine TMS managers:
       2.2.1.1. Define, document, and adopt safety risk management matrices and/or tables.
       2.2.1.2. Report annually the propulsion safety risk management situational status and
       guidance to their respective Centers, the appropriate PMs, Headquarters Air Force
       Material Command (AFMC) safety office, and lead-MAJCOM safety offices.
       2.2.1.3. Notify the DoP and their respective air vehicle PMs of all safety hazards and
       risks IAW the timelines and critical hazard classifications as specified in Table 2.4.
       2.2.1.4. Identify “Propulsion Safety Threshold (PST)” risks or hazards per Table 2.1. –
       Table 2.3. Establish, in coordination with PMs, an appropriate understanding of
       propulsion specific risks. IAW the MIL-STD-882 methodology, use the propulsion-
       hazard severity category assignments (Table 2.1.) and hazard probability level
       assignments (Table 2.2.) to define the propulsion safety threshold (PST) risk levels
       (Table 2.3). Note: The PST risks or hazard statuses are evaluated at points in time
       consistent with baseline, interim, and final notification criteria as specified in Table 2.4.

     2.2.1.6. Revise/update propulsion hazard risk assessments IAW para. 2.2.12.
  2.2.2. The DoP shall ensure propulsion safety managers (leads):
     2.2.2.1. Establish and maintain an appropriate propulsion system safety program
     (project) according to DoP established processes and MIL-STD-882.
     2.2.2.2. Integrate system safety efforts with other engineering and program milestones.
     2.2.2.3. Identify and assess safety hazards and risks throughout the engine program life
     and report safety risks that require acceptance IAW DoDI 5000.02.
     2.2.2.4. Provide propulsion system safety assessments for design and program reviews.
     2.2.2.5. Conduct special tests to verify proper system performance and ensure that safety
     managers resolve or control all hazards.
     2.2.2.6. Track identified hazards and their solutions, when feasible or applicable.
     2.2.2.7. Document management decisions for acceptance of mishap risks.
     2.2.2.8. When required by the DoP, develops quantitative propulsion system safety
     criteria and operating limits in concert with the system program office or operational
     command.
     2.2.2.9. Support System Safety Groups / System Safety Working Groups for aircraft that

     system development, modification, and sustainment.
     2.2.2.11. Provide a copy of any engine hazard risk acceptance documentation to the
     specific Engine TMS manager.
  2.2.3. Air Vehicle PMs shall integrate the MIL-STD-882 system safety methodology into the
  air vehicle program’s systems engineering process IAW DoDI 5000.02. The PM’s lead
  systems engineer (LSE) will work with the Engine TMS Manager and the Propulsion Safety
  Manager to evaluate and respond to hazard identifications and risk assessment notifications.
  This involves integration of the propulsion-specific safety risks into the overall program’s
  system safety process. As a critical part of this system safety process, the PM shall obtain
  formal risk acceptance IAW DoDI 5000.02.
  2.2.4. Propulsion system safety risk assessment types (for use with Table 2.4 for DoP Risk
  Assessment Timelines):
     2.2.4.1. Baseline risk assessment shall be developed following a new propulsion hazard
     or safety risk surfacing, depending on the seriousness of the new hazard or risk as
     described in this publication. Note: Baseline risk is the MIL-STD-882 “initial risk” that is
     retained in the PM and DoP hazard tracking system.
     2.2.4.2. Interim risk assessment will be developed, depending on the seriousness of the
     new hazard or risk as described in this publication. The interim risk will represent the
     reduction, if any, of the baseline risk due to inspections, life limits, flight restrictions or
     other maintenance. If interim actions are not feasible, the interim risk equals the baseline
14                                                       AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014


     risk. Note: Interim risk usually results from the “non-hardware” fixes possible to reduce
     risk exposure.
     2.2.4.3. Final risk will be calculated once funding is obtained and a fleet implementation
     plan for the corrective action is developed. Final risk is the average risk over the baseline
     exposure period (typically remaining weapon systems life) that accounts for the baseline
     period, interim actions, if any, and final corrective actions. Note: This risk is the MIL-
     STD-882 “target risk” that is retained in the PM and DoP hazard tracking system, which
     reflects the risk level that will be attained after funding and implementation of corrective
     actions.
  2.2.5. At a minimum, risk assessments shall contain the following:
     2.2.5.1. Background: Description of events, photos, drawings or diagrams, and
     investigation results of sufficient detail to describe the history and impact of the new
     events.
     2.2.5.2. Failure Mode and Effects: Hazardous condition description and an explanation
     of the cause of the condition and the effects.
     2.2.5.3. References: Prior applicable risk assessments and related source documents.
     2.2.5.4. Assumptions: Suspect population, usage rates, ERLOA/NRIFSD ratio, metal
     containment factor if applicable, life analysis assumptions if applicable, or future fleet
     flying hour estimation.
     2.2.5.5. Risk Quantification: Future events and rates estimation, explanation of statistical
     techniques utilized i.e. Weibull analysis, Monte Carlo simulations, probability estimation,
     if applicable life limited parts Low Cycle Fatigue (LCF) life, deterministic/probabilistic
     fracture mechanics life, or LCF initiation plus propagation statistical distribution.
     2.2.5.6. Conclusions/Recommendations: Summary of risk in terms of NRIFSD rate and
     predicted ERLOA recommended interim field actions with supporting rationale and
     impact to risk, long term corrective action concepts, and impact to risk.
  2.2.6. In parallel to the propulsion safety risk determination, notification of new propulsion
  system hazards and risks to the respective PMs shall be accomplished using a systematic and
  phased approach IAW Table 2.4. This will result in an increased level of understanding of
  the hazard, risk, root cause, corrective action plan, and risk mitigation effectiveness as the
  new hazard investigation process progresses. The following describes the notification
  timelines and the phased reporting content to the PMs required for any newly discovered or
  on-going propulsion risks or hazards.
     2.2.6.1. The existing Deficiency Reporting System, as defined by T.O. 00-35D-54,
     establishes the notification timeline for deficiencies. This same timeline shall be utilized
     as the basis for reporting new hazards and risks as a function of hazard severity
     categories based on MIL-STD-882 terminology. Note. With the understanding that
     propulsion system failure modes can potentially involve extensive investigation and
     engine testing to determine root cause, deviations from the below indicated “final”
     notification timeline can be made if mutually agreed to between the Engine TMS
     managers, the PMs, and the risk acceptance authority. Note. If the new hazard is
     associated with an active Safety Investigation Board, the Convening Authority shall
AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                      15


       provide notification IAW AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports. The timelines
       described in Table 2.4 shall not apply until notification and authorization to share the
       mishap information has been provided to the Engine TMS manager.
       2.2.6.2. The timelines in table 2.4 begin at the “time of discovery of the new hazard.” If
       events make the definition of a “time of hazard discovery” unclear, then the “time of
       hazard discovery” shall be defined by the Engine TMS manager in coordination with the
       Using Command, and the PM. Notification of the hazard discovery shall be
       accomplished via an e-mail memorandum from the Engine TMS manager and transmitted
       IAW the instructions in paragraphs 2.2.7., 2.2.8., and 2.2.9.

Note: For the purpose of this table the “Qualitative Level of Fidelity” implies a subjective
educated assessment by aircraft/propulsion experts and risk analysis experts based on the limited
level of information available at the time of hazard discovery. The term “Quantitative Level Of
Fidelity” refers to an analytical analysis (usually statistical) based on numerical data of the
number of aircraft or engine parts involved, their operating hours and any other pertinent
numerical facts combined with defined assumptions needed to complete the analysis (e.g. assume
a 60% inspection effectiveness based on past experience of similar inspections).

   2.2.7. Catastrophic hazard notification timeline: Note: A propulsion hazard has a
   catastrophic severity if it meets the catastrophic definition in Table 2.1 or in MIL-STD-882.

   2.2.10. Program Execution Chain Risk Acceptance.
          2.2.10.1. DoDI 5000.02 requires formal risk acceptance by the appropriate authority in
          the program execution chain “prior to exposing people, equipment, or the environment”
          to a known hazard. DoDI 5000.02 states: “Prior to exposing people, equipment, or the
          environment to known system-related ESOH hazards, the Program Manager shall
 18                                                       AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014


      document that the associated risks have been accepted by the following acceptance
      authorities: the Component Acquisition Executive for high risks, Program Executive
      Officer-level for serious risks, and the Program Manager for medium and low risks. The
      user representative must, as defined in MIL-STD-882E, be part of this process throughout
      the life cycle and will provide formal concurrence prior to all serious- and high-risk
      acceptance decisions.” The following paragraphs describe the AF process for complying
      with the DoDI 5000.02 requirement for hazards identified by the propulsion enterprise.
      2.2.10.2. For air vehicle systems in development, the PM must work closely with the
      DoP community to respond to the DoP hazard notifications described above. This
      involves the PM integrating DoP-identified risks with program office’s system safety risk
      management effort and working with the DoP community to evaluate and implement
      appropriate design changes or mitigations. During development, there is no requirement
      for formal risk acceptance on a specific timeline, until an activity is planned that involves
      the exposure of people, equipment, or the environment to the hazard.
      2.2.10.3. For air vehicle systems in sustainment, the DoDI 5000.02 risk acceptance
      requirement creates the necessity for rapid decision-making on whether to suspend
      system operations (i.e. “grounding” a system) or obtain appropriate risk acceptance to
      allow operations to continue. Table 2.5 defines the AF risk acceptance timelines that
      constitute full compliance with the DoDI 5000.02 risk acceptance requirement for fielded
      systems.

DoP Risk Assessments. (Note: PM Risk Acceptance for systems not yet fielded must occur
prior to exposing people, equipment, or the environment.)

      2.2.10.4. IAW MIL-STD-882, for High risk hazards, the Component Acquisition
      Executive (CAE) (SAF/AQ) is the risk acceptance authority.
          2.2.10.4.1. In response to the baseline DoP hazard notification, if the PM determines
          the Air Vehicle risk to be High, the PM will notify the risk acceptance authority and
          user representative within 24 hours with a recommendation to temporarily accept the
          risk or suspend system operations. For the purposes of complying with DoDI
          5000.02, this baseline notification shall constitute the initial risk acceptance and will
          be in effect for no more than 20 days (until the interim notification). Within 24 hours
          of the baseline notification, both the risk acceptance authority and the user
          representative must concur with the PM’s risk acceptance recommendation or direct
          the suspension of system operations.
          2.2.10.4.2. In response to the interim DoP hazard notification, if the PM determines
          the Air Vehicle risk to be High, the PM will notify the risk acceptance authority and
AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                   19


        user representative within 5 days with a recommendation to temporarily continue to
        accept the risk or to suspend system operations. For the purposes of complying with
        DoDI 5000.02, this interim notification shall constitute an extension of the temporary
        risk acceptance that will be in effect until the final notification. Within 24 hours of
        the interim notification, both the risk acceptance authority and the user representative
        must concur with the PM’s risk acceptance recommendation or direct the suspension
        of system operations.
        2.2.10.4.3. In response to the final DoP hazard notification, if the PM determines the
        Air Vehicle risk to be High, the PM will submit within 10 days a recommendation to
        the risk acceptance authority and the user representative to formally accept the risk
        for the timeframe required to implement, validate, and verify the recommended
        mitigations or to suspend operation of the system. IAW AFI 91-202, for high risks,
        the risk acceptance package must also be coordinated with the AF Chief of Safety.
     2.2.10.5. For Serious risk hazards, the PEO is the risk acceptance authority.
        2.2.10.5.1. In response to the baseline DoP hazard notification, if the PM determines
        the Air Vehicle risk to be Serious, the PM will notify the risk acceptance authority
        and user representative within 24 hours with a recommendation to temporarily accept
        the risk or suspend system operations. For the purposes of complying with DoDI
        5000.02, this baseline notification shall constitute the initial risk acceptance and will
        be in effect for no more than 35 days (until the interim notification). Within 24 hours
        of the baseline notification, both the risk acceptance authority and the user
        representative must concur with the PM’s risk acceptance recommendation or direct
        the suspension of system operations.
        2.2.10.5.2. In response to the interim DoP hazard notification, if the PM determines
        the Air Vehicle risk to be Serious, the PM will notify the risk acceptance authority
        and user representative within 5 days with a recommendation to temporarily continue
        to accept the risk or to suspend system operations. For the purposes of complying
        with DoDI 5000.02, this interim notification shall constitute an extension of the
        temporary risk acceptance that will be in effect until the final notification. Within 24
        hours of the interim notification, both the risk acceptance authority and the user
        representative must concur with the PM’s risk acceptance recommendation or direct
        the suspension of system operations.
        2.2.10.5.3. In response to the final DoP hazard notification, if the PM determines the
        Air Vehicle risk to be Serious, the PM will submit within 10 days a recommendation
        to the risk acceptance authority and the user representative to formally accept the risk
        for the timeframe required to implement, validate, and verify the recommended
        mitigations or to suspend operation of the system.
     2.2.10.6. For Medium and Low risk hazards, the air vehicle PM is the risk acceptance
     authority.
        2.2.10.6.1. In response to the baseline DoP hazard notification, if the PM determines
        the Air Vehicle risk to be Medium or Low, the PM will notify the user representative
        within 24 hours with a recommendation to temporarily accept the risk or suspend
        system operations. For the purposes of complying with DoDI 5000.02, this baseline
 20                                                       AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014


          notification shall constitute the initial risk acceptance and will be in effect until the
          final notification (there is no interim risk acceptance for less than critical hazards).
          Within 24 hours of the baseline notification, the user representative must concur with
          the PM’s risk acceptance recommendation or direct the suspension of system
          operations.
          2.2.10.6.2. In response to the interim DoP hazard notification, if the PM determines
          the Air Vehicle risk to be Medium or Low, the PM will work closely with the DoP
          community to evaluate proposed mitigations in support of the final DoP notification.
          2.2.10.6.3. In response to the final DoP hazard notification, if the PM determines the
          Air Vehicle risk to be Medium or Low, the PM will submit within 10 days a
          recommendation to the user representative to concur with acceptance of the risk for
          the timeframe required to implement, validate, and verify the recommended
          mitigations or to suspend operation of the system.
   2.2.11. Lead Command response to propulsion hazard or risk notification:
      2.2.11.1. The AF lead command for a system is the designated “user representative” as
      required in DoDI 5000.02 for concurrence prior to a risk acceptance decision by the
      designated risk acceptance authority.
      2.2.11.2. Any baseline or interim hazard or risk notification shall be responded to within
      24 hours of receipt. The intent of the response will be to satisfy the DoDI 5000.02
      requirement for user representative concurrence on risk acceptance, and the lead
      command must concur with the hazard classification and coordinate and establish a
      mutual understanding if aircraft grounding or operational limitations are being
      considered.
      2.2.11.3. Formal risk acceptance packages from the PM will be evaluated and concurred
      with or rejected prior to PM submittal to the risk acceptance authority. The intent of this
      concurrence review will be to accept the existing plans for risk mitigation or elimination
      in the specified time period.
   2.2.12. Propulsion hazard risk assessment revision (updates) and notification will be
   accomplished if interim or corrective action plan risks change due to delayed
   implementation, reduced interim or corrective action effectiveness, increased unpredicted
   failures or for other issues that, in the judgment of the Engine TMS manager, warrant
   notification. A PM update notification is not required unless the revised propulsion hazard
   risk increases.
2.3. Propulsion Safety Management Program.
   2.3.1. The DoP shall send an annual message to affected PMs, MAJCOM/A4s; Air Force
   Chief of Safety (AF/SE); and HQ USAF Directorate of Logistics (AF/A4L). This message
   shall summarize the propulsion risks on all engines, actions being taken, and any
   programmatic issues affecting the plan of action for engines managed by the USAF which

                                            Chapter 3

                    COMPONENT IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM (CIP)

3.1. General. The DoP is responsible for overall management and execution processes of CIP.
CIP overarching guidance is provided by DoDI 5000.02 Operation of the Defense Acquisition
System, and AFI 63-101. The CIP is the source of sustaining engineering support to develop
solutions to the AF’s engine problems for in-service engines not under Contractor Logistics
Support (CLS) or “power by the hour” type maintenance. Objective of the CIP is to correct
design; manufacturing; or the maintenance procedures of parts, components, and support
equipment that limit engine safety, reliability, durability, and operational capability that cannot
be corrected under warranty or other contract provisions. CIP also establishes a prioritized list of
projects and tasks each calendar year, and funds those above the “cut line” using AF Research,
Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) funds from program element (PE) 27268F. CIP
also supports testing and maturation of newly fielded engines.
3.2. Execution Management Roles.
   3.2.1. DoP shall:
       3.2.1.1. Ensure assignment and documented identification of CIP managers for
       applicable engine TMSs.
       3.2.1.2. Provide CIP managers guidance and processes.
       3.2.1.3. Approve CIP Program Management Agreements (PMAs).
       3.2.1.4. Coordinate the CIP POM submissions for RDT&E funding including
       preparation of the R-2 document and New Start notification.
       3.2.1.5. Implement changes and modifications that have demonstrated the appropriate
       Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and Manufacturing Readiness Levels.
       3.2.1.6. Program, budget and execute post-CIP requirements on behalf of MAJCOM
       customers.
       3.2.1.7. Direct the work of CIP managers with assistance from the Responsible Test
       Organization, to ensure engine changes and modifications are adequately tested before
       approval for production and implementation.
       3.2.1.8. Monitor and report execution status to PMs and PEOs.
       3.2.1.9. Prepare annual CIP project and task lists in coordination with, PMs, MAJCOMs,
       Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), and other applicable stakeholders.
   3.2.2. PMs shall plan and budget for incorporation of modified engines into aircraft.
   3.2.3. The Technical Airworthiness Authority (TAA) shall approve aircraft airworthiness
   type design certification documents IAW AFI 62-601 USAF Airworthiness.
   3.2.4. Responsible Test Organization shall:
       3.2.4.1. Serve as the Development Test and Evaluation agent in support of the systems
       engineering test and evaluation process, system integration and test, and transition to and
AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                    23


     certification of readiness for dedicated Operational Test and Evaluation IAW AFI 99-
     103, Capabilities-Based Test and Evaluation.
     3.2.4.2. Coordinate the development test strategy for each CIP project or task that
     requires engine-level testing.
  3.2.5. Lead MAJCOM shall:
     3.2.5.1. Communicate operational goals and requirements for specific engine TMS CIP
     and assist the DoP and Senior Engineering Leader in establishing requirement priorities.
     3.2.5.2. Coordinate on CIP PMAs.
     3.2.5.3. Coordinate on EHM requirements and advocate for program funding and CIP
     support.
     3.2.5.4. Provide appropriate representatives to the Engine CIP Working Group (ECWG).
  3.2.6. International Participation in CIP: International partners are able to participate in the
  USAF CIP program via the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program and membership in the
  International Engine Management Program (IEMP). They benefit from the CIP through cost
  sharing on common improvements to the engine TMSs in their fleet. Maintaining common
  configuration/currency with CIP engines will maximize the benefits for membership
  countries. An Engine TMS owner participates in the cost pool of all tasks that benefit the
  TMS; no selective participation. CIP-derived improvements in components, procedures,
  technical data and repairs are not to be shared with non-IEMP members. In addition, engine
  manufacturers are not permitted to release CIP information to non-IEMP countries.
  Note: See Attachment 4 for guidance to compute the Engine CIP Fair Share Rate.
     3.2.6.1. Member countries shall be invited to CIP User’s Conference’s and planning
     meetings.
     3.2.6.2. Participating foreign countries shall receive proposed Engineering Change
     Proposals (ECPs) through the IEMP for review/coordination.
     Note: They will receive copies of approved ECPs and follow their own implementation
     plan.
     Note: Foreign militaries may appoint, at their discretion, Foreign Liaison Officers (FLOs)
     to perform as their single Point of Contact (POC) for CIP efforts.
     3.2.6.3. If individual countries submit task proposals through IEMP country managers
     for inclusion in the CIP, the CIP manager shall determine if the task is considered unique
     to one or several FMS countries. A task is FMS unique if the USAF does not have a need
     for it.
     Note: OEMs submit proposals for EAB approved FMS unique tasks like all other tasks
     on the approved list.
     3.2.6.4. Execution cost of an FMS unique task shall be borne by the benefiting FMS
     country or countries. In case of a dispute in determination of FMS uniqueness of a task,
     the DoP will make the final decision.
 24                                                     AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014


       3.2.6.5. After a user’s initial membership in the CIP is established, continuous
       membership is required to obtain improvement benefits. If a user experiences a lapse in
       service, the CIP manager shall ensure equitable RDT&E costs are facilitated for all
       members by applying a reinstatement cost.
       3.2.6.6. International partner’s participation in an engine enhancement program for non-
       CIP engines shall be a unique cooperative process between the engine contractor, DOD
       components, and international partners.
3.3. CIP Processes. The four integrated processes inherent to CIP are requirements generation,
requirements approval, program execution, and product transition.
   3.3.1. CIP Requirements Generation. Requirements originate from the field via mishap
   reports, service and material deficiency reports, CIP Users’ Conferences, and maintenance
   data. In addition, CIP proactively uses experience from the test and evaluation community,
   the Life Cycle Management and Sustainment Centers, the laboratories, and commercial
   experience of the contractors to generate requirements.
       3.3.1.1. Prior to the ECWG presentation, CIP manager will accomplish the requirements
       generation process that is depicted in Figure 3.1.
       Note: This process relies on developing and selecting strategic options based primarily
       on safety and reliability and maintainability needs.
       3.3.1.2. Engine Health Indicators/Metric (EHI/M) Goals. Top-level engine health shall
       be managed by the EHI/M defined in Chapter 5. The TMS engine-specific plan for
       setting and achieving these goals will be documented in the ELMP. Achievement of
       these goals shall be the primary objective of the requirements generation process.
       Specific customer- set goals shall be defined for safety, availability, reliability,
       maintainability, and affordability. Note: Issue dependent metrics may also be used.
       3.3.1.3. Customer Requirements Forums. In addition to the top-down view provided by
       the EHI/M goals, a bottoms-up approach shall also be used to identify specific engine
       deficiencies and customer requirements. These inputs will be collected via customer
       requirements solicitations and/or forums; e.g., MPWG and World-Wide User’s
       Conferences. Additionally, top driver information shall be collected from Deficiency
       Reports (DRs) and other usage statistics; e.g., Average Time on Wing (ATOW), Mean
       Time Between Removal (MTBR), Unscheduled Engine Removal (UER).
       3.3.1.4. Planning Forums. Considering engine health metric goals and the specific engine
       issues, the CIP manager shall generate a list of proposed solutions to resolve specific
       known issues and propose systemic improvements for long-term achievement of these
       goals (e.g., Service Life Extension Programs). These issues and solutions will be
       consolidated into specific engineering tasks for which the cost, schedule, and expected
       improvement in the engine health metric can be identified. The Senior Engineering
       Leader will ensure:
          3.3.1.4.1. Presentation of tasks to appropriate forums such as Propulsion Safety and
          Technical Reviews.
          3.3.1.4.2. Development of plans to implement the CIP tasks and coordinate with
          stakeholders’ (e.g., DoP, Engine TMS managers, PMs, Lead MAJCOMs).
AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                25


Figure 3.1. CIP Requirements Generation Process




   3.3.2. CIP Requirements Approval Process: The CIP requirements approval process will
   utilize the ECWG and EAB forums to integrate the user, technical, acquisition, and
   sustainment communities.
      3.3.2.1. The ECWG shall include participation from Engine TMS and CIP managers, and
      representatives of the PM and lead MAJCOM. The ECWG will annually provide the
      future year requirements and prioritization for the TMS-specific engine needs to the CIP
      Manager.
      3.3.2.2. The EAB is a decision-making forum chaired annually by the DoP. Using the
      Engine TMS-specific requirements generated by the ECWG, the Senior Engineering
      Leader for Propulsion shall:
26                                                       AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014


         3.3.2.2.1. Ensure the needs for all the engines in the CIP portfolio are collected into a
         single combined requirement.
         3.3.2.2.2. In the year prior to program execution, rank the entire combined task list
         and a cut line determined based upon projected funding by applying a scoring process
         that is focused on the achievement of the AF defined engine health metrics.
         3.3.2.2.3. Technically validate data/outputs from the ECWG and EAB (initial
         approval) and provide to the DoP for final approval.
  3.3.3. CIP Execution Process: The CIP task list and contracting actions shall be coordinated
  with the DOP. The DoP shall provide the operational instructions that the Engineering
  Project Descriptions in the proposals must comply with. CIP managers will accomplish
  technical evaluations of proposals and a BCA prior to start of contract negations.
  Note: Periods of Performance (PoPs) of Delivery Orders (DOs) to basic contracts may vary
  by contracts.
     3.3.3.1. CIP managers, with     Senior Engineering Leader for Propulsion oversight, shall
     work with the contractors        in planning and execution of engineering work and
     substantiation and validation   of improvements. Engine TMS managers will oversee the
     logistic implementation plan    of each Engineering Project Description and provide their
     inputs to the CIP managers.
     3.3.3.2. Changes to the CIP shall be submitted to the DoP for consideration and decision
     action guidance. Safety related changes shall be submitted immediately, all others as
     established by the DoP.
     3.3.3.3. The AFLCMC Financial Management Functional shall:
         3.3.3.3.1. Manage financial activities during program execution.
         3.3.3.3.2. Monitor funding obligations and expenditures against the Secretary of
         Defense goals and provide an end-of-month briefing to DoP.
     3.3.3.4. When the validation and substantiation of a task is complete and accepted by the
     TMS CIP Manager, all engineer development work ends, and the contractor submits an
     Engineering Change Proposal (ECP). Based on nature of changes, the TMS CIP
     Manager shall classify the ECP into one of three categories: Class I, Special Series Class
     II, and Class II.
         3.3.3.4.1. Class I ECP shall cover changes in form, fit, and function of a component
         and is approved by the System Configuration Control Board.
         3.3.3.4.2. Special Series Class II ECP shall be for improvements that do not involve
         changes in form, fit, or function; e.g., changes/corrections in engineering drawings.
         The Senior Engineering Leader for Propulsion is the authority to approve Special
         Series Class II ECPs.
     3.3.3.5. Contractor’s support in production incorporation shall be included in the CIP
     contract. TMS CIP manager shall work closely with the contractor during production
     incorporation and once the production incorporation is complete, officially close the CIP.
AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                     27


  3.3.4. CIP Product Transition Process: The final step in a successful CIP process is to
  transition the products developed and validated under CIP to the user. This process is
  outlined in Figure 3.3. For hardware re-designs, the Engine TMS manager shall ensure
  integration of activities with the PM. For CIP products that must either be fielded quickly
  (e.g., safety) or are classified as a modification (form-fit-function replacements) as defined in
  AFI 63-131 Modification Management, shall be fielded via retrofit using procurement
  funding; therefore, these items shall be identified IAW the POM process to receive funding.
  Note: To facilitate this critical coordinated effort, the PCoE BP-06-24 Propulsion Systems
  Modification Management Process is utilized. Despite the return-on-investment (ROI)
  benefits of many CIP tasks, procurement budget limitations cause CIP products to be fielded
  using a “preferred spare” attrition method utilizing Operations and Maintenance (O&M)
  funding. This simplifies the transition process, but typically triples the time necessary to
  complete fielding.
  3.3.4.1. As reflected in Figure 3.3, the modification management process shall utilize the
  results of the CIP tasks combined and other means that may apply, to identify engine
  modification candidates requiring funds to implement. The modification requirements shall
  be incorporated into the ELMP.

      3.3.4.2. The DoP shall ensure coordination with the lead MAJCOMs and key
      stakeholders in the propulsion community.
      3.3.4.3. The lead MAJCOM, IAW PMA, shall plan and support incorporation of
      expected CIP products by way of attrition/retrofit.

             WHOLE ENGINE SPARE REQUIREMENTS COMPUTATION

4.1. Propulsion Requirements System (PRS). Whole spare engine requirements computations
establish acquisition and distribution of spare engine levels. The acquisition computation
establishes the quantity of whole spare engines the AF needs to buy for the System until
retirement. The distribution computation establishes the quantity and locations where the AF
will place its spare engines based on current planning policy and engine reliability. In addition,
other computations are accomplished for repair and retention requirements. The AF standard
system used for the computation of whole spare engine requirements is D087Q also known as,
PRS. An overview of PRS is provided in Figure 4.1.

Figure 4.1. PRS Overview




   4.1.1. Documentation. The DoP shall ensure adequate supporting documentation is
   maintained for the whole spare engine requirements computations to establish an effective
   system of management controls. This includes documentation to support assumptions made,
   verify the accuracy of data used, validate the currency/applicability of data, identify data
   (factor) changes and trends, and re-create the requirements computation if required. Sources

        4.2.5.1.3. Document briefings presented, decisions reached, action items, and status
        of actions.
        4.2.5.1.4. Develop factors to reflect the transition from peace to surge to sustained
        war. The DoP will determine the need to develop mature or actual factors, or both.
        The peace, surge, and sustained war factors that are established under the ERO
        responsibility shall be: Shop Visit Rate (SVR); Not Reparable This Station (NRTS);
        and Pipeline Times as provided by the MPWG, to include Base Repair In-work Times
        and Depot Repair In- work Times.
            4.2.5.1.4.1. Transportation standards shall be obtained from T.O. 2-1-18, Aircraft
            Engine Operating Limits and Factors guidance and utilized as a factor for spare
            engine requirements.
            4.2.5.1.4.2. Within each type factor, values shall be used for three time frames:
            peacetime, war surge, and war sustained. Factors shall be established from data
            analysis supported by documented assumptions and rationale. The sustained
            values may be the same as the peacetime values when data are not available.
            Supporting data, rationale, assumptions, and decisions shall be documented.
            Explanations shall be included in the documentation for decisions without
            supporting data.
            4.2.5.1.4.3. Mathematical modeling and computer simulation shall be used to
            develop factors or documented why not used.
            4.2.5.1.4.4. The factors shall be developed using the assumptions that engines
            have a zero wear out rate and that all unserviceable spare engines are capable of
            being repaired.
            4.2.5.1.4.5. Engine factor changes shall be approved for use in requirements
            calculations when coordination has been obtained from the Lead Command and

           when there is significant military or commercial performance and reliability
           experience.
           4.2.5.1.4.9. Factors for the TMS or combined TMS shall be developed at either
           worldwide or command level depending on mission, operation, support
           differences, or requirements calculations methods.
           4.2.5.1.4.10. Estimated repair pipeline times for the engine shall be developed to
           flow through each segment of the pipeline per T.O. 2-1-18.
           Note: This is the average time to accomplish all necessary pipeline processes.
           Elements are frequency of occurrence, required manpower, facilities, tools,
           equipment, parts and technical data. Standard pipeline times for mature engine
           TMS, as documented in T.O. 2-1-18, serve as a goal for each maintenance,
           transportation and supply activity to achieve and should not consider delays for
           induction to maintenance and supply.
        4.2.5.1.5. Spare engine computations representing maturity shall use standard
        pipeline times and a mature SVR. The mature SVR shall consider the impact of both
        Unscheduled Engine Removals (UER) and Scheduled Engine Removals (SER) over
        time.
           4.2.5.1.5.1. The mature estimate will reflect the point in the engine’s life cycle
           when only small changes are expected to occur in the slope of the UER rate curve
           per flying hour.
           4.2.5.1.5.2. SER shall be evaluated to determine if there is a stable slope, or if
           “peaks and valleys” exist. If a stable SER exists, that value shall be used in the
           computation. Where “peaks and valleys” are expected to exist, the Engine TMS
           Manager will make a recommended buy decision after considering the impact at
           points such as; the peak SER value, the minimum SER value and selected mid-
           range values between the peak and minimum. Note: Groups such as the EAB,
           Senior Steering Groups, MPWG may also be utilized to develop factors and used
           to compute spare engines
     4.2.5.2. Aerospace Engine Life (AEL) Committee:
        4.2.5.2.1. Validate, at least annually, changes to factors used in development of
        Actuarial Removal Interval (ARI) tables for the distribution computation or when
        necessary to correct accuracy of forecasting ARI Tables.
        4.2.5.2.2. Recommends changes to factors (provided by actuaries from engine
        history) based on changes in engine reliability, employment of weapon system, and
        maintenance philosophies that affect the ARI table development. Timing shall ensure
        incorporation of approved factor changes in the development of ARI tables for use in
        the next PRS and repair computation cycle.
        4.2.5.2.3. Factors that shall be reviewed are: projected peace flying hours, overfly
        hours, scheduled/unscheduled engine removal rates, non-usage removal rates,
        changes in operating limits and component life expectancy, JEIM return rates/NRTS,
        changes in force structures and utilization rates, application percentages, base and
        depot screens, hour to cycle ratios, and periodic inspection requirements.
AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                   33


          4.2.5.2.4. The Engine TMS manager, prior to the AEL convening, shall forward
          necessary data to MAJCOM CEMs for review of proposed factor changes for
          development of ARI tables.
              4.2.5.2.4.1. The data shall include rationale for the changes and projected impacts
              of the changes in the removal forecasts.
              4.2.5.2.4.2. The CEMs shall review and assess the impacts of the proposed
              changes and provide any alternative or additional factor change recommendations
              to the Engine TMS actuaries for inclusion in the review process.
              4.2.5.2.4.3. The Engine TMS actuaries shall present supporting data and rationale
              for their proposal to the AEL.
              4.2.5.2.4.4. If consensus of affected MAJCOMs is not achieved, the DoP shall
              defer to the Lead MAJCOM for the factor changes resolution.
              4.2.5.2.4.5. The Engine TMS manager shall maintain documentation of
              rationale/justification for approved factor changes.
              4.2.5.2.4.6. Engine TMS manager shall review forecast accuracy metrics for
              engine removals and ARIs quarterly.
4.3. General Stock Level Computation Requirements.
   4.3.1. Unit Level Requirements Modeling: the PRS shall compute safety stock levels at the
   lowest supply level.
      4.3.1.1. For units that fly and fight in place: PRS shall consider peacetime assets as
      available to support wartime pipeline requirements and stock units with the greater of
      their peace or war requirement.
      4.3.1.2. For those units that deploy: The entry of a “J-Day” (JEIM availability day) shall
      determine if peacetime assets are available or not to support wartime pipeline
      requirements.
          4.3.1.2.1. A “J-Day” of 1 means that peacetime assets are available and PRS shall
          stock the unit with the greater of their peace or war requirement.
          4.3.1.2.2. A “J-Day” entry greater than 1 means PRS will compute the unit stock
          considering that maintenance will not be available until the J-Day indicated, PRS
          shall stocks these units with the sum of their peace and war requirement.
      4.3.1.3. The total number of spare engines required at a specific base, with more than
      one unit with the same Mission Design Series (MDS) and TMS combination shall be the
      sum of each unit’s peace or war requirement.
   4.3.2. Safety Stock Levels: Safety stock shall protect against pipeline shortages due to the
   uncertainty in the forecasted demand, repair production processes, and transportation pipeline
   performance. The PRS shall compute safety stock levels for:
      4.3.2.1. The depots based on repair and retrograde pipelines.
      4.3.2.2. Each unit with an independent deployment or operational capability for both
      base repair and depot re-supply pipelines.

      4.3.2.3. Centralized JEIM/Repair Network Integration (RNI) repair facilities based on
      base repair, retrograde from the supported unit(s) and depot re-supply pipelines.
      4.3.2.4. Each Forward Operating Location (FOL) and Forward Supply Point based on
      the serviceable re-supply pipeline from the JEIM site.
4.4. Acquisition Stock Level Computation.
   4.4.1. Spare whole engine acquisition requirements shall be computed using PRS. The PM
   shall obtain and review PRS initial acquisition computations prior to establishing an engine
   spares requirement for a new system. For CLS engines, the lead MAJCOM and PM may use
   PRS to validate the contractor spare engine requirements estimates.
      4.4.1.1. Spare engine acquisition shall be limited to the smallest number of engines
      essential to support the largest programmed requirement for each increment of the
      weapons system’s production contract.
      4.4.1.2. During System Development and Demonstration phase, the PM and Lead
      MAJCOM, in coordination with the DoP, shall perform an analysis to determine the cost
      effectiveness of making a buyout decision for the TMS engine. If the TMS engine is a
      commercial or commercial derivative engine, a life cycle cost analysis shall be conducted
      that considers the benefits of a fixed inventory and the associated costs for support and
      modifications.
   4.4.2. There are four types of acquisition computations.
      4.4.2.1. Initial: The initial computation shall be the first computation performed for a
      new TMS. The Engine TMS manager will determine when sufficient data are available to
      perform the baseline (initial) PRS computation.
      4.4.2.2. Annual: A computation shall be performed annually after the initial computation
      to address any changes (program data, pipelines, maintenance concept, and actuarial data)
      that have occurred. The results shall be published in the ELMP.
      4.4.2.3. Buyout: The Engine TMS manager shall perform a buyout computation to
      determine the final procurement quantity of spare whole engines for the TMS prior to the
      end of the engine production run. Buyout computations shall be completed lead-time
      away from the closure of the engine production line.
      4.4.2.4. Others: Changes to force structure, weapon system procurement schedules,
      mission, or overall program changes will drive additional computations during the
      acquisition cycle.
   4.4.3. Acquisition Computation Process Description: This process shall be followed for any
   type of acquisition computation (see Figure 4.2.).
      4.4.3.1. Initiate Computation: The Engine TMS manager, in coordination with the PM
      and Lead MAJCOM, shall accomplish the whole spare engine acquisition computation,
      and will initiate a review of the PRS model input factors to determine if an updated
      computation is required. If required, the Engine TMS manager shall initiate the action
      necessary to produce the updated computation. War planning scenario used for
      computation shall be consistent with current distribution war scenario data. The CEM
      will provide any unique command requirements such as additives, FOLs, etc.
AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014                                                               35


     Documentation of all additives shall explain how the additive quantity was determined
     and why the requirement could not be expressed through the conventional methodology
     (i.e., PRS). The MAJCOM CEM and the Engine TMS manager shall keep all
     documentation as long as the additive is required.
     4.4.3.2. Peace Flying Hours: The peacetime program shall be extracted from the latest
     PA document by the Engine TMS manager. The force structure bed-down reflected in
     the PA document will be updated to reflect the latest approved bed-down changes. If the
     PA document does not contain the needed peacetime information, the CEMs shall obtain
     and provide the peacetime information (flying hours and basing structure) to be used in
     the computation. Any force structure bed-down changes not contained in the latest PA
     shall have documentation and justification for inclusion in the computation.
     4.4.3.3. War Flying Hours: The wartime program shall be extracted from the RDAT
     based on the latest war computation data provided by AF/A5X. Wartime hours related to
     the squadrons will be revised to maintain consistency with any changes identified in the
     peacetime program information. If the RDAT does not contain the needed wartime
     information, the MAJCOMs CEMs shall obtain and provide the wartime information
     (flying hours and basing structure) to be used in the computation. Any force structure
     bed- down changes not contained in the latest RDAT shall have documentation and
     justification for inclusion in the computation.
     4.4.3.4. Actuarial Removal Intervals: The ARIs are developed by the ERO as previously
     detailed in Paragraph 4.2.5.1.
     4.4.3.5. Repair Pipeline Times: The field level and depot repair pipeline times are
     developed by the ERO in accordance with Paragraph 4.2.5.1.4.10.
     4.4.3.6. Transportation Pipeline Times: The transportation pipeline times shall be the
     standards published by the Uniform Material Movement and Issue Priority System
     (UMMIPS), refer to DoD 4140.1-R, DoD Supply Chain Materiel Management
     Regulation, for guidance.
     4.4.3.7. Maintenance Concept: The MPWG will provide the maintenance concept (both
     peace and war), including NRTS rate, to be used in the computation, once approved by
     the ERO.
     4.4.3.8. Concurrence of Computation Input Factors: Prior to accomplishing the
     computation, the Engine TMS manager shall document the Engineering, PM, Lead
     MAJCOM/A4, and DoP concurrence of the input factors.
     4.4.3.9. Acquisition Stock Level Computation: The Engine TMS manager shall load the
     information into PRS and run the model.

Figure 4.2. Acquisition Computation Flow Chart




   4.4.4. Coordination and Approval of Results: The Engine TMS manager shall accomplish
   coordination with applicable stakeholders and submit to applicable PMs for endorsement and
   to the DoP for approval.
   4.4.5. Implementation Plan: shall develop a computation implement plan that is coordinated
   with lead MAJCOM and PMs and approved by the DoP.
   4.4.6. Buyout Support Period: Before the closure of the engine production line, the Engine
   TMS manager performs a buyout computation that determines the number of spare engines
   required to support the applicable MDS during its planned life. The buyout computation will
   document whether the computation reflects maturity [Maturity = fleet age > 500,000 Engine
   Flying Hours (EFHs)] or another support period.
      4.4.6.1. During engine production, the Engine TMS manager shall determine the actual
      number of spare engines required to support an MDS. The Engine TMS manager shall
      initiate a computation that will reflect the actual number of spare engines required to
      support an MDS over a period of time. Note: Period being next two to three years, with
      the requirement being computed quarter-by-quarter.
      4.4.6.2. The computation shall reflect maturity when fleet age is greater than 500,000
      EFHs.
      4.4.6.3. When required to perform a buyout computation for an immature engine
      (Immature = fleet age<500,000EFH), the first step shall be to identify the time period
      when the MDS will be fully supported from a spare engine perspective. Unless
      separately identified by either AF/XO or the lead MAJCOM, the period to be fully
      supported shall begin with the delivery of the last MDS with the TMS being computed.
      Actuarial factors and pipeline times representing the supported period shall be developed
      for use in the buyout computation. Computation results shall be used by the Engine TMS
      manager in recommending a spare engine procurement quantity. Note: Depending on the
AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                 37


       estimated period of immaturity in years, evaluating requirement at various points may
       also be required.
   4.4.7. Small Fleet (10 or fewer aircraft): Before a TMS reaches maturity and near term
   supportability problems are expected by the System or Propulsion managers, the Engine
   TMS manager shall initiate a small fleet computation. The actual number of spare engines
   required shall use the projected “actual” SVR and pipeline times.
   4.4.8. Special Stock Levels: Engine TMS managers shall generate special stock levels for
   small engine inventories and air breathing drone engines.
       4.4.8.1. The following percentages shall be used to establish stock levels when 10 or
       fewer new MDS aircraft are to be procured or remain in the inventory:
          4.4.8.1.1. For single engine aircraft, 50 percent.
          4.4.8.1.2. For twin-engine aircraft, 40 percent.
          4.4.8.1.3. For aircraft with more than two engines, 30 percent.
       4.4.8.2. The owning MAJCOM and Engine TMS manager shall jointly determine the
       operating unit's stock level for air breathing drone engines based on the operational
       concept, maintenance concept, and programmed flying hours.
   4.4.9. Whole Engine Requirements Considerations for Quick Engine Change (QEC) Kit
   Acquisition: The PM, with Engine TMS manager input, shall determine the quantity of QEC
   kits to be bought. They shall be bought as life-of-type items and are regulated by the
   quantity of spare engines.
       4.4.9.1. QEC Configurations: If there is more than one engine configuration:
          4.4.9.1.1. Requirement for each configuration shall be determined by computing the
          proportions of each configuration installed on each aircraft.
          4.4.9.1.2. The total raw computational requirement shall be multiplied by the portion
          of each configuration (do not round off the requirement).
          4.4.9.1.3. Each new requirement to the ready rate table shall be used to determine
          requirements for each configuration.
          4.4.9.1.4. All configurations requirements shall be added together to determine total
          requirement.
4.5. Distribution Stock Level Computation. The purpose of the distribution computation is to
determine spare whole engine operational requirements and distribution for using MAJCOMs
and Engine TMS managers.
   4.5.1. Spare whole engine distribution stock level requirements shall be computed using
   PRS.
   4.5.2. Distribution Stock Level Computation Process Description: The computation shall be
   conducted at least annually (one of several events in the whole engine requirements process,
   see Figure 4.3). The computation, which requires a classified processing capability, shall
   include participation from MAJCOM CEMs, Engine TMS manager and actuary, PRS

        formatted for input into the PRS database.
        4.5.2.1.2. If the PA (peacetime) and/or RDAT (wartime) document does not contain
        the needed information, the MAJCOM CEMs shall obtain and provide the
        information (flying hours and basing structure) to be used in the computation.
        4.5.2.1.3. Any force structure bed-down changes not contained in the latest PA shall
        have adequate documentation and justification for inclusion in the computation.
        4.5.2.1.4. Notification will be sent to all participants for endorsement prior to the
        computation.
     4.5.2.2. Actuarial Removal Interval (ARI): An ARI shall be developed for engine
     scheduled and unscheduled removals for all maintenance levels for both peace and war
     by the Engine TMS Actuaries through mathematical models, simulations, statistical
     trends, and historical analysis.
        4.5.2.2.1. The Engine TMS manager shall:
            4.5.2.2.1.1. Maintain documentation of supporting data, rationale, assumptions,
            and decisions as an appendix to the published ARI tables.
            4.5.2.2.1.2. Screen engine removals to exclude engines removed to facilitate
            other maintenance.
            4.5.2.2.1.3. Consider time remaining on life-limited components.
        4.5.2.2.2. The Engine TMS actuary shall furnish ARI data for PRS computation at
        least 14 duty days prior to PRS conference.
     4.5.2.3. Repair Pipeline Times: Repair pipeline standards in TO 2-1-18 shall be used for
     the PRS computation. The TMS MPWG will review pipeline times at least annually and
     recommend changes to the standards contained in TO 2-1-18 when required.
     4.5.2.4. Transportation Pipeline Times: TO 2-1-18 shall be used for transportation
     pipeline times.
     4.5.2.5. Basing/Maintenance Concept: The computation shall use the basing structure
     contained within the PA/RDAT document. Note: Addition of bases required to account
     for spare engines pre-positioned at en-route locations to support transiting strategic airlift
     aircraft may also be included as FOL. Units that have multiple configurations of engines
     that cannot be interchanged due to engineering or safety of flight considerations may also
     be considered.
AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                39


     4.5.2.6. Coordination of Computation Input Factors: All input factors will be coordinated
     with the MAJCOM CEMs and Engine TMS managers prior to accomplishing the
     computation.
     4.5.2.7. Distribution Stock Level Computation: The D087Q manager shall load the
     information into PRS. The MAJCOM CEM shall run the computation for their
     individual command. The Engine TMS manager shall roll-up computation across all
     MAJCOMs for each TMS.
     4.5.2.8. Post Computation Actions: The Engine TMS manager shall determine spare
     engine availability vs requirement immediately following the computation.
        4.5.2.8.1. Non-Constrained Allocations: If engine availability is non-constrained,
        engines shall be allocated to using commands in accordance with the PRS
        computations or MAJCOM/A4 approved additives. MAJCOMs shall provide written
        justification for additives.
        4.5.2.8.2. Constrained Allocations: A constrained engine is when the computed spare
        engine requirements exceed the total available spare engine inventory. If engine
        availability is constrained, the lead command shall coordinate an equitable allocation
        with using MAJCOMs and Engine TMS manager. The lead command MAJCOM/A4
        shall certify the allocations. Prior to the Lead MAJCOM coordination, the following
        shall be accomplished:
            4.5.2.8.2.1. Engine TMS manager shall provide suggested allocation to lead
            MAJCOM/A4 after accomplishing the following:
                4.5.2.8.2.1.1. Allocate 100% peacetime requirement (Base Stock Level (BSL)
                and Repair Cycle Requirement). Determine negotiated/projected Depot
                returns.
                4.5.2.8.2.1.2. Adjust Depot pipeline requirement, if required.

                4.5.2.8.2.1.4. Determine depot safety levels allocation.
            4.5.2.8.2.2. Lead MAJCOM shall:
                4.5.2.8.2.2.1. Allocate 100% peacetime requirement for all locations.

          4.5.2.8.4. MAJCOM CEM shall notify applicable bases of their approved base stock
          level engines and applicable WRE engine levels, with information copy to respective
          Engine TMS manager. Note: These levels remain in effect until the next computation
          cycle, unless changes have occurred requiring a mid-cycle re-computation, or as a
          result of negotiations between the MAJCOM CEM and the TMS Manager.
          4.5.2.8.5. Redistribution of Engines: If required, the lead MAJCOM CEM shall be
          responsible for developing a redistribution plan to include the TMS, the losing
          MAJCOM, the gaining MAJCOM, and the schedule for transfer. All engine transfers
          will be in accordance with T.O. 2-1-18. The plan will be provided by message to all
          users NLT 30 Sep prior to the beginning of the FY.

   4.5.3. Consolidation Computation Process. Engine configurations with a high reliability of
   on wing time may require a consolidation computation process in addition to the PRS
   distribution stock level computation process. This process may be required when peace
   requirements offset war requirements to an unacceptable WRE level. Use of a consolidation
   computation is a lead MAJCOM option.
      4.5.3.1. The consolidation computation process shall use the raw requirements computed
      by PRS to determine peace and war requirements for units within a regional/Main
      Operating Base (MOB) support structure and shall:
          4.5.3.1.1. Identify the bases/units that will be supported by a regional/MOB location.
          4.5.3.1.2. Consolidate the peace requirement for the individual units/bases under the
          regional/MOB location.
          4.5.3.1.3. Combines the war requirements of those units that deploy to the same

           engine requirement for the appropriate confidence level and enter in the “Regional
           Peace Engine Rqmt” column for each Regional Center.
           4.5.3.2.4. Continue process until all peace requirements are determined.
           4.5.3.2.5. Total the “Regional Peace Engine Rqmt” column at the bottom as the
           “Total Base Peace Rqmt”. Enter the “Depot Peace Rqmt from the PRS Comp”
           directly below the base level total.
       4.5.3.3. Consolidation Computation Process for war Table 4.3 (PRS Consolidation
       Worksheet):
           4.5.3.3.1. Determine 30-day average peak war raw requirement for each unit along
           with war deployed location and enter the raw requirement in the “Unit Raw War Peak
           Rqmt” column.
           4.5.3.3.2. For units from the same Continental United States geographic area that
           deploy to the same WAR location, total WAR raw requirements for the location and
           enter in “Total Raw War Rqmt by Location” column.
           4.5.3.3.3. Determine WAR engine requirement from Table 4.4 (Confidence Level
           Table) by locating the range that the sum of the raw requirements equal and select the
           whole engine requirement for the appropriate confidence level, and enter this number
           in “War Engine Rqmt” column for each deployed location.
           4.5.3.3.4. Continue this process for each geographic area and WAR location.
           4.5.3.3.5. Total “War Engine Rqmt” column at the bottom as the “Total War Base
           Lvl Rqmt”. Enter the “Depot War Rqmt from the PRS Comp” directly below the
           base level total.
       4.5.3.4. Consolidated Requirement shall be determined as follows:
           4.5.3.4.1. Total the war requirements in the “War Engine Rqmt” column for all
           deployed locations and units within each geographic area and enter in “Regional
           WRE” column on the line of the Regional Center.
           4.5.3.4.2. For the “Regional BSL” column, add the total peace requirement from
           “Regional Peace Engine Rqmt” column to the WRE identified in the “Regional
           WRE” column and enter on the Regional Center line. (This gives the Regional Center
           an engine for resupplying units in Peace time.)
           4.5.3.4.3. Total the “Regional BSL” and the “Regional WRE” columns for base level
           requirements at the bottom.        Enter the Depot requirements from the PRS
           computations immediately below the base level total. The sum of these two numbers
           is the total Consolidation Requirement.
4.6. Target Serviceable Requirement (TSR). TSR is a portion of the computed peacetime
requirement that is necessary to be serviceable in support of special demands and where periodic
spikes in removal outpace forecasted production. TSR is not an additive requirement. TSRs are
not authorized for constrained engines.
   4.6.1. TSR is established at MAJCOM discretion. Computation of TSR will be
   accomplished by analyzing PRS model results using 80% ready rate as a baseline and
 44                                                      AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014


   varying ready rates up to 99%. The delta between 80% and the higher ready rate becomes
   the TSR.
   4.6.2. Validation and Approval of TSR: Documentation of all TSRs shall explain how the
   TSR quantity was determined. The requesting MAJCOM/A4 shall provide justification to
   the DoP with copy to the Engine TMS manager. The MAJCOM CEM and Engine TMS
   manager shall keep all documentation as long as the TSR is required and for two years after
   TSR is removed.
4.7. Additive Requirements. An Additive is a requirement not computed through normal
computational methodology and manually added to the PRS requirement. If PRS can compute
the requirement with validated rates and factors then an additive is not appropriate. Additive
requirements for retaining assets otherwise considered for disposal or termination are not
appropriate. Additives are not authorized for constrained engines and are only valid for the
current PRS comp cycle.
   4.7.1. Additive requirement examples:
       4.7.1.1. Training: Assets required to provide spare engine(s) used by Air Education and
       Training Command (AETC) field training teams or detachments that do not have war
       flying hours in PRS.
       4.7.1.2. Special Projects/Unit Segmentation: Assets required to provide spare engine(s)
       in support of undefined tasks as directed by AF or MAJCOMs.
       4.7.1.3. Small fleet multi engine aircraft:
          4.7.1.3.1. Foreign Object Damage (FOD)/Bird-strike history combined with a normal
          failure could exceed computed BSL.
          4.7.1.3.2. Real-world peace obligation to support multiple long-term commitments
          where no spare engines are computed.
   4.7.2. Documentation of Additive Requirements: Documentation of all additives shall
   explain how the additive quantity was determined and why the requirement could not be
   expressed through the PRS methodology. The requesting MAJCOM A4M or designee will
   forward the justification letter to the DoP with copy to the Engine TMS manager. The
   MAJCOM CEM and Engine TMS manager shall keep all documentation as long as the
   additive is required and for two years after additive is removed.
4.8. Overhaul Computation. The Overhaul Computation process includes a whole engine
repair computation and negotiations of repair quantities to determine the number of whole
engines requiring maintenance, depot and/or field, for the current and Five Year Defense Plan
(FYDP).
   4.8.1. DoP shall accomplish whole engine repair computations annually in sufficient time to
   be used for the annual Repair Negotiations with MAJCOM CEMs.
       4.8.1.1. MAJCOM CEMs and Engine TMS managers will negotiate a production
       requirement for each TMS based on computed numbers and coordinate results with the
       applicable PMs. Once the negotiated repair levels are set, the operating commands, PMs,
       and/or the Centralized Asset Management (CAM) office, will commit to funding the
       negotiated number of engine inductions during a particular time, and the repair activities
AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014                                                               45


      will agree to repairing and returning, as serviceable, an agreed to number of whole
      engines.
      4.8.1.2. MAJCOM CEMs shall notify the Engine TMS managers when projected flying
      hours used for computation of the repair requirements change outside the published
      flying hour document. The Engine TMS manager shall determine if the repair
      requirements’ re-computation is necessary. If the flying hour change will impact repair
      requirement, the Engine TMS manager shall re-accomplish computation and
      negotiate/collaborate repair requirement increases/decreases with funds holder, Lead
      MAJCOM and PM.
   4.8.2. Repair Computation Process: The repair computation shall use the Engine Overhaul
   Requirements Computation Worksheet, Figure 4.4.

Figure 4.4. Computation of Engine Repair Requirements (Output Quantity) Worksheet




      4.8.2.1. Computation of Whole Engine Repair Requirements:
         4.8.2.1.1. (Line 1) Engine Hours – Peace: The whole engine repair requirements
         computation begins with the flying hours for the engine and MAJCOM being
         projected. These flying hours represent the peacetime flying hours projected for the
         engine and are based on the PA data received from Air Staff to include projected
         over-fly hours received from the MAJCOMs.
         4.8.2.1.2. (Line 2) ARI Factor: For the purposes of calculating the whole engine
         repair requirement, only the Overhaul Removal Interval/With Maximum Time
46                                                 AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014


     (OHRI/WMT) is used. The OHRI/WMT reflects the average number of flying hours
     between engine overhauls and/or 2LM repairs, which both occur at a depot or
     contractor facility.
     4.8.2.1.3. (Line 3) Usage Change: The result of this calculation (Line 1 divided by
     Line 2) represents the usage changes for overhaul and/or 2LM action for the engine
     for the computed period.
     4.8.2.1.4. (Line 4) Base Stockage Objective: The BSL objective represents the
     number of engines a MAJCOM is required to have available or “in stock” at their
     installations. BSL can be either computed by the PRS or negotiated by the Engine
     TMS manager and MAJCOM.
     4.8.2.1.5. (Line 5) Safety Level Requirement: The safety level represents the
     number of engines a MAJCOM is required to maintain over and above their BSL to
     support the unevenness of generations. These are usually maintained at the
     depot/repair facility. Propulsion Division approval is required.
     4.8.2.1.6. (Line 6) Total Stockage Requirement: In addition to the whole engines
     required to support the projected flying hour program, a certain number is needed to
     maintain a certain stock level for the applicable MAJCOM. This total stockage level
     is comprised of a BSL objective and the depot safety level requirement (if approved).
     4.8.2.1.7. (Line 6) Beginning Inventory (line 6, 1st Column): The beginning
     inventory represents the adjusted MAJCOM spare asset position at the end of the
     period prior to the time frame being computed.
     4.8.2.1.8. (Line 7) Asset Variance: The total stockage requirement is compared to
     the assets on hand or projected to be on hand at the beginning of the period being
     calculated (end of the previous quarter). The delta between the requirement and the
     beginning inventory represents the additional engines that must be repaired to
     maintain the stock level. If more engines are in the inventory at the beginning of a
     computation period than are required to meet the stock level of the MAJCOM, these
     assets can be used to offset either the flying hour requirement or other obligations.
     This calculation will normally only result in a delta during the first quarter of the
     computation or of a fiscal year since a new BSL is only established once a year.
     4.8.2.1.9. (Lines 8 and 9) Serviceable Obligation–Loss and Serviceable Obligation–
     Other: Engines may also be obligated for other uses which will increase the overhaul
     requirement. Service Obligation–Loss refers to those serviceable assets that have
     been obligated to another use such as a training requirement or a Foreign Military
     Sales (FMS) customer. Service Obligation–Other represents those serviceable assets
     that have been obligated to another service within the DOD, payback to another
     MAJCOM, Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM), etc.
     4.8.2.1.10. (Line 10) Gross Overhaul Requirements:           The Gross Overhaul
     Requirement is calculated using the sum of the following:
        4.8.2.1.10.1. Engines need to support the forecasted flying hour program (Line
        3).
        4.8.2.1.10.2. Assets needed to cover the difference between BSL plus safety
AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                  47


             requirements and inventory on hand at beginning of the period being computed
             (Line 7).
             4.8.2.1.10.3. The engines obligated by the MAJCOM for another use (Lines 8
             and 9).
         4.8.2.1.11. (Line 11) Projected Serviceable Receipts: Prior to the calculation of the
         final (net) overhaul output requirement, the Gross Overhaul Requirement is offset by
         any serviceable assets the MAJCOM expects to receive from any source (e.g., new
         production, return of low time assets from Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration
         Group (AMARG), Quality Deficiency Returns where the user was not charged an
         overhaul cost, etc.).
         4.8.2.1.12. (Line 12) Net Overhaul Requirements: The net overhaul requirement is
         Gross Overhaul Requirement (Line 10) offset by Projected Serviceable Receipts
         (Line 11). This requirement represents the number of engines that must be available
         as output from depot level repair facility to satisfy all of the MAJCOMs requirements
         for that engine during the period.
         4.8.2.1.13. (Line 13) Current Schedule/Adjusted Requirements: This requirement
         considers any adjustment between current scheduled production and repair
         requirement. In the first quarter, enter current project directive (or contract)
         negotiated output quantity. Compare this quantity with the figure on line 12. If
         current schedule is greater than line 12, subtract the overage from the next quarter
         entry on line 12 and enter result. Continue until the overage is absorbed. If the
         current schedule is less than the figure on line 12, the shortage will be added to next
         quarter line 12 requirement. After initial adjustment has been accomplished, lines 12
         and 13 will be equal. These quantities become the Adjusted Requirement. This
         number serves as the basis for negotiation process and is eventually converted to the
         number of engines that must be input into the repair pipeline. The input requirement
         is what is ultimately converted to a dollar requirement for publication into the Depot
         Purchased Equipment Maintenance (DPEM) Brochure via Centralized Access for
         Data Exchange.
  4.8.3. Approval: The Engine TMS manager shall coordinate the repair computation with the
  MAJCOM CEM and PM for approval by the DoP or designee.
  4.8.4. Increases to Computed Requirement: A negotiated increase is a requirement not
  computed through normal computational methodology and manually added to the computed
  repair requirement. Increased repair requirement documentation will be prepared by the
  requesting organization. Documentation shall explain how the additional repair requirement
  was determined and why the requirement could not be determined via repair computation
  process. The requesting MAJCOM CEM and Engine TMS manager shall keep all
  documentation as long as the increased repair is required and for two years after increase is
  removed.
  4.8.5. The Engine TMS manager shall convert Overhaul Output requirements to Input and
  Funding requirements.
  4.8.6. Repair requirement increases subsequent to the repair meeting shall be documented
  and retained as described under paragraph 4.8.4 above.

   4.8.7. Approval of Repair Increases: Whole engine repair requirement increases during year
   of execution above the programmed objective memorandum will follow CAM guidance.
4.9. Retention Computation. The purpose of the retention computation is to identify engine
retention requirements, inventory long supply and potential excess quantities for planning
appropriate management action. The Engine TMS manager shall perform the retention
computation at least annually following the PRS computation cycle, or as needed to cover
special program needs.
   4.9.1. Approval Process: The DoP or designee is the final approval authority for excess
   decisions, may be delegated no more than two levels. If the DoP disapproves proposal, no
   further action is required. If the DoP approves excess quantities, the Engine TMS manager
   shall coordinate with other DOD agencies to ensure a valid requirement does not exist for the
   TMS.
4.10. Whole Engine Reclamation and Disposal.
   4.10.1. Engines shall be sent to reclamation only after it has been determined requirements
   for these engines do not exist within DOD.
   4.10.2. Engine TMS manager shall:
      4.10.2.1. Be responsible for engine assets on aircraft held in storage codes XS or XT
      upon change of the storage code to XX or XV. Note: For additional data ref to Air Force
      Pamphlet (AFPAM) 23-118, Logistics Codes Desk Reference and AFJMAN 23-210,
      Joint Service Manual (JSM) for Storage and Materials Handling.
      4.10.2.2. Add engines into the Engine Requirements Retention Computation as required.
      4.10.2.3. Coordinate with the PMs to determine if AMARG-stored engines are needed in
      support of aircraft missions or have the potential for reuse. Note: The PM is accountable
      for the integrated life cycle management of a system until that system is disposed.
      4.10.2.4. Work with PMs and Lead MAJCOM CEMs to dispose of engines, through the
      DLA Disposition Services (DLADS) [previously, Defense Reutilization and Marketing
      Service (DRMS)], which are no longer needed to support the AF mission, or can be
      reclaimed or used to support FMS.
      4.10.2.5. Evaluate the need for inactive engines identified on the annual AMARG engine
      listing in conjunction with the annual Distribution Stock Level Computation and notify
      PMs and AMARG of disposal requirements based on this evaluation.
      4.10.2.6. Report reclaimed engines as losses in CEMS D042 database IAW TO 00-25-
      254-1.
      4.10.2.7. Transfer all residual engines/engine items that do not have reclamation
      instructions to the local DLADS activity for disposal IAW AFI 23-101, Air Force
      Materiel Management Note: Residue resulting from engine reclamation that might be
      potential hazardous waste will be processed IAW AFI 32-7042, Waste Management.

                       ENGINE HEALTH MANAGEMENT (EHM)

7.1. General. EHM processes support DoDI 4151.22, Condition Based Maintenance Plus
(CBM+) for Materiel Maintenance, Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 63-1/20-1, Integrated
Life Cycle Management; and AFI 20-115 Propulsion Management for Aerial Vehicles for AF
propulsion assets. Additional information/guidance, is also at the Condition Based Maintenance
Plus DoD Guidebook; TO 0025257, Engine Health Management Plus (EHM+) General
Information Users’ Manual; AFI 21101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management.
   7.1.1. EHM is the application of CBM+ concepts to aircraft engines and shall be
   implemented into all new acquisition propulsion systems and current/fielded propulsion
   systems where technically feasible and beneficial. The enterprise goal of EHM is to tie
   together ET&D and RCM to enable a predictive maintenance end state capability. However,
   implementation of EHM will vary depending on the TMS support concept, MAJCOM
   requirements, and data availability.
   7.1.2. Engine Trending & Diagnostics (ET&D). ET&D integrates hardware, software,
   maintenance, diagnostic and prognostic processes to quantify and monitor/manage engine
   health. A variety of software applications on ground-based computers are the primary
   analysis tools to diagnose and monitor engine health. ET&D activities shall help maintainers
   determine if maintenance must be performed before the next flight and/or the next scheduled
   engine removal based on engine operating data. The primary goal shall be:
       7.1.2.1. Prevent or limit damage to turbine engines by prediction or early detection of
       performance degradation and/or failures.
       7.1.2.2. Minimize the deployment footprint by standardizing and consolidating ET&D
       hardware, software, test instrumentation, techniques/procedures, and base level tasks.
   7.1.3. ET&D Data Sources and Utilization. ET&D utilizes data from a variety of sources
   including: on- board aircraft and engine data collection devices, test cell data collection
   devices, maintenance records/data systems, Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI) and oil
   analysis data. ET&D analyses shall be used to: predict, detect and conduct pre-emptive
   analysis of adverse trends; forecast time and material requirements to optimize supportability
   and maintenance man-hours; develop engine trend algorithms and provide support to field
   users by diagnosing engine performance problems; determine engine operational parameters
   in support of mishap/problem investigations; and reduce life cycle costs and optimize
   reliability through improved measurement of life used on critical components.
   7.1.4. Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM). RCM is an analytical process to determine
   the appropriate failure management strategies, including preventive maintenance
   requirements and other actions that are warranted to ensure safe operations while balancing
   readiness and costs. Through utilizing the RCM process, maintainers learn to optimize
   Expected Time on Wing (ETOW) through disciplined analysis and structured processes to
   identify cost effective and technically sound maintenance practices. These practices affect
   field and depot maintenance, supply, training, engineering, operator procedures, technical
   data, and other areas to ensure the most effective maintenance practices are used.
AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                   57


       7.1.4.1. RCM Data Sources and Utilization. RCM utilizes data from a variety of
       sources; e.g., including: maintenance records/data systems, primary failure and root cause
       records/data systems, cost data systems. RCM analyses shall be used to: reduce shop
       flow days, improve reliability by phasing out time-based removals and increasing ATOW
       or MTBR, and reduce life cycle costs.
7.2. New Acquisitions. EHM shall be included in the selection of maintenance concepts,
technologies and processes for all new aircraft engines based on readiness, requirements, life-
cycle cost goals and RCM-based functional analysis. EHM tenets shall include: designing
engines that require minimum/need-driven maintenance, appropriate use of embedded
diagnostics and prognostics, improved maintenance analytical and production technologies,
automated maintenance information generation, trend based reliability and process
improvements, integrated information systems response based on equipment maintenance
condition, and smaller maintenance and logistics support footprints.
   7.2.1. The PM, Lead MAJCOM/A4, AFRL, and DoP are the principles to facilitate the
   implementation of EHM into new acquisition and legacy propulsion systems. They shall
   collaborate to coordinate decisions/activities that impact EHM direction, processes and
   implementation with key stakeholders, develop implementation/sustainment plans for EHM

                    ENGINE HEALTH INDICATORS/METRICS (EHI/M)

8.1. General Information. The DoP and Engine TMS managers shall develop and utilize
EHI/M to drive a desired behavior with standardized engine metrics that provide leadership an
overview of readiness and sustainment issues. The metrics and indicators shall be organized by
the capability or attribute that they measure.
    8.1.1. Each Metric/Indicator shall be divided into four sections: Metric Objective, Metric
    Description, Metric Methodology, and Metric Interpretation
    8.1.2. Those metrics that have established goals will display stoplight indicators on the same
    page as the graph and support data. The goals will be generated for each engine Type,
    Model, Series (TMS). The stoplight indicators cover the current reporting period; however,
    stoplight indicators for future periods are subjective assessments and require management
    decision. Note: Metrics that provide a historical trend will not be assigned a goal and
    relevant stoplight indicators.
    8.1.3. The Engine TMS managers shall obtain and report EHI/M to the DoP.

8.2. Safety.
    8.2.1. Engine System Safety (ESS): The goal of the ESS metric is to maximize flight safety.
        8.2.1.1. Metric Objective: The ESS metric shall be a composite over-arching
        measurement of safety risk for a given TMS. All the safety issues on each TMS shall be
        tracked and an overall system risk related to the individual risk of each identified safety
        issue established.
AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                    61


     8.2.1.2. Metric Description: The issues identified by this metric shall be those that are
     identified by the Engine Risk Management Process, which is detailed in the PCoE, BP
     99-06.
         8.2.1.2.1. A safety issue will be identified from a number of sources, to include,
         Deficiency Reports (DRs), IFSD, NRIFSD, ERLOA, test and evaluation, research
         and development, field, overhaul, and mishaps. Identified safety issues shall be
         assessed for relative risk.
         8.2.1.2.2. Assessed risk will be mitigated through several methods, to include
         material changes, process changes and maintenance/inspection practices. Each risk
         mitigation action shall be tracked via the ESS metric.
  8.2.1.3. Metric Interpretation: The ESS will present the number of known safety issues,
  grouped according to their risk color code defined by PCoE BP 99-06.
         8.2.1.3.1. Each individual safety issue will be assigned a stoplight indicator of Red,
         Yellow, or Green according to its assessed risk level and its related risk mitigation
         actions. TMS’s that have one or more red issues shall be scored an engine safety
         status of red. TMS’s that have zero red issues but one or more yellow issues shall be
         scored an engine safety status of yellow. TMS’s that have zero red issues and zero
         yellow issues shall be scored an engine safety status of green.
  8.2.2. NRIFSD: The goal of this metric is to minimize the NRIFSD rate.
     8.2.2.1. Metric Objective: This safety indicator shall provide quarterly trending of
     NRIFSD rate for a given TMS. Refer to PCoE BP 99-06 for actions to be taken when
     exceeding established PST on this indicator.
     8.2.2.2. Metric Description: Any engine shutdown in-flight, either due to an engine
     malfunction or by the aircrew following flight manual procedures whereby: the engine is
     unable to restart, or further investigation determines that a restart attempt would not have
     been successful, or further investigation determines that continued operation would have
     caused the engine to fail, or the aircraft cannot maintain level flight at a safe altitude as
     determined by the situation.
     8.2.2.3. Metric Methodology: NRIFSD rate shall be calculated as the number of
     NRIFSD in the fleet within a time interval divided by the EFHs within the same interval,
     multiplied by 100,000. This metric will show the 6 quarter rolling average and a
     cumulative value for each quarter of the fiscal year. Number of NRIFSD is defined as
     the NRIFSD rate within a time interval times the EFHs within the same interval divided
     by 100,000.
  8.2.3. ERLOA: The goal for this metric is to minimize the ERLOA rate.
     8.2.3.1. Metric Objective: This safety indicator shall provide quarterly trending of
     ERLOA for a given TMS. Refer to PCoE BP 99-06 for actions to be taken when
     exceeding established PST on this indicator.
     8.2.3.2. Metric Description: An engine related mishap resulting in destruction of an
     aircraft.
 62                                                       AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014


       8.2.3.3. Metric Methodology: ERLOA shall be calculated as the number of engine
       related loss of aircraft in the fleet life per 100,000 engine flying hours. ERLOA will
       show the 6 quarter rolling average and cumulative value per quarter for each fiscal year.
       Mishap data is obtained from the Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS) database
       maintained by the USAF Safety office.
8.3. Availability.
   8.3.1. Net Serviceable Metric: This metric is used as a tool for managing serviceable engines
   to an ideal level. The standards for this metric shall be established within the PRS model to
   portray the current net serviceable quantity of engines for peace and wartime in a risk format.

Figure 8.1. Net Serviceable Metric




       8.3.1.1. Metric Description: This metric graphically portrays the risk to peace and war
       posture based on the current net serviceable engine quantity.
           8.3.1.1.1. Peace: The number of serviceable engines required to support peacetime
           operations.
           8.3.1.1.2. WRE: The number of serviceable engines required to support the Air Force
           war tasking. Engines required to support a weapon system from the start of the war
           until re-supply is established.
       8.3.1.2. Metric Methodology:
           8.3.1.2.1. Net Serviceable: The number of total serviceable engines minus installed
           and obligations. Data for computing the metric can be found in the Propulsion
           Automatic Re- supply Report in CEMS. Serviceable due-ins shall be in serviceable
           built-up status. Obligations to base possessed aircraft shall be excluded in the net
           serviceable computation. Obligations to depot possessed aircraft that exceed the base
           level Primary Aircraft Inventory shall also be excluded.

         Number of Weeks in Month
         8.3.1.2.1.3. Net Serviceable (Quarterly Average) = Sum of Monthly Averages ÷ 3
     8.3.1.3. Metric Interpretation: Peace and war stock levels used in the metric shall be
     computed by PRS. An 80% confidence factor will be used in the PRS computation to
     account for “peaks and valleys” associated with spare engine demands.
         8.3.1.3.1. Peace Levels:
             8.3.1.3.1.1. Red = High risk due to net serviceable level at or below zero
             (mitigation rules allow utilizing engines temporarily from PDM facility in some
             instances).
             8.3.1.3.1.2. Yellow = Medium risk due to net serviceable level between 0 and the
             PRS established peacetime resupply quantity (of engines being produced at time
             of need for during peace operations, calculated by PRS).
             8.3.1.3.1.3. Green = Low/no risk due to net serviceable level between peacetime
             resupply quantity and 125% of allocated WRE that supports peace operations.
             8.3.1.3.1.4. Yellow/Green = Excess due to net serviceable level greater than
             125% of allocated WRE.
         8.3.1.3.2. WRE Levels:
             8.3.1.3.2.1. Red = High risk as net serviceable level is below the 70% PRS
             computed confidence level. (Not to be confused with 70% of allocated WRE.)
             8.3.1.3.2.2. Yellow = Medium risk as net serviceable level is equal to or greater
             than the PRS computed confidence of 70% and less than the MAJCOM allocated
             level.
             8.3.1.3.2.3. Green = Low/no risk as net serviceable level is equal to or greater
             than the MAJCOM allocated level.
             8.3.1.3.2.4. Upper and Lower Control Limits = 100% to 125% of allocated WRE.
     8.3.1.4. For reporting purposes, the following WRE/TSR color ratings shall be used:
         8.3.1.4.1. Yellow/Green = WRE/TSR is greater than 125% of the MAJCOM
         allocated level.
         8.3.1.4.2. Green = WRE/TSR is between 100% and 125% of the MAJCOM allocated
         level.
         8.3.1.4.3. Yellow = WRE/TSR is greater than or equal to the PRS computed
         confidence level of 70% and less than the MAJCOM allocated level.
         8.3.1.4.4. Red = WRE/TSR is less than the PRS 70% confidence level.
  8.3.2. BSL: This metric shall determine if there are sufficient spare engines to support the
  peace and war mission to an 80% ready rate for combat and non-combat coded units.
64                                                     AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014


     8.3.2.1. Metric Description:
         8.3.2.1.1. Engine BSL is the number of spare engines (serviceable and unserviceable)
         required at bases to support peace and war requirement to an 80% ready rate. Note:
         WRE a subset of BSL.
         8.3.2.1.2. Computed BSL: BSL shall be computed by PRS to support the peace and
         war requirement to an 80% ready rate.
         8.3.2.1.3. Allocated BSL: BSL can be allocated in place of the computed requirement
         (constrained or non-constrained). This quantity shall be determined by the Lead
         MAJCOM/A4 in coordination with the using MAJCOMs.
         8.3.2.1.4. On Hand: Actual number of spare engines available at the bases, including
         in- transit engines (repairable and serviceable); excludes base level obligations.
     8.3.2.2. Metric Methodology:
         8.3.2.2.1. Data from the Propulsion Automatic Re-supply Report in CEMS shall be
         used for the BSL Computations.
         8.3.2.2.2. Metric Computations: On Hand BSL (Weekly Snapshot) equals the Total
         Qty NET on Hand + Total Qty Serviceable Due-in + Total Qty Repairable Due-in.
         Serviceable due-ins shall be in serviceable built-up status. Obligations to base
         possessed aircraft shall be excluded in the net serviceable computation.
         8.3.2.2.3. On Hand BSL (Monthly Average) = Sum of Weekly Snapshots ÷ Number
         of Weeks in Month
         8.3.2.2.4. On Hand BSL (Quarterly Average) = Sum of Monthly Averages ÷ 3
     8.3.2.3. Metric Interpretation:
         8.3.2.3.1. Green = On hand assets greater than or equal to 90% of the Computed
         BSL.
         8.3.2.3.2. Yellow = On hand assets are less than 90% of the Computed BSL and
         greater than or equal to 90% of the allocated BSL.
         8.3.2.3.3. Red = On hand is less than 90% allocated BSL.
     8.3.2.4. Occasionally the Allocated BSL may be set above the Computed level. Color
     Ratings in this event shall be:
         8.3.2.4.1. Green = At or above 90% of the allocated level.
         8.3.2.4.2. Yellow = Below 90% of the allocated level but at or above 90% of the
         Computed level.
         8.3.2.4.3. Red = Below 90% of the computed level.
  8.3.3. ENMCS: This metric shall determine if the flow of parts is adequate to support the
  field requirements.
     8.3.3.1. ENMCS applies only to uninstalled engines undergoing repair or build-up where
     work stoppage resulted because spare parts were not available and supply requisitions
     have been submitted. An engine shall not be considered ENMCS when in work and a
AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                  65


       work stoppage occurs for lack of manpower, tools, work space, or parts that are in repair
       cycle processing due-in from maintenance.
       8.3.3.2. Metric Description:
           8.3.3.2.1. Average quantity and/or percent of uninstalled engines in work stoppage
           awaiting parts from the supply system over a given time period.
           8.3.3.2.2. Acceptable quantity and/or percent of the uninstalled engines in NMCS
           status.
               8.3.3.2.2.1. For non-trainer aircraft engines, criteria shall be less than 10%
               ENMCS and/or 10 engines.
               8.3.3.2.2.2. For trainer aircraft engines criteria shall be less than 20% and 20
               engines.
           8.3.3.2.3. ENMCS%: The average percent of the uninstalled ENMCS engines during
           a given time period.
           8.3.3.2.4. # ENMCS Engines: The average quantity of ENMCS engines during the
           time period.
       8.3.3.3. Metric Methodology:
       8.3.3.3.1. Data Collection: The NMCS Uninstalled Engine Status Report in CEMS data
       shall be used for determining ENMCS%. Refer to TO 00-25-254-2, Comprehensive
       Engine Management System Manual for DSD: D042 to navigate to the NMCS
       Uninstalled Engine Status Report.
           8.3.3.3.2. ENMCS% = NMCS Days ÷ Asset Days
               8.3.3.3.2.1. ENMCS Days: Total number of days of serviceable and reparable
               engines ENMCS within the reporting period.
               8.3.3.3.2.2. Asset Days: Total numbers of days serviceable and reparable engines
               were uninstalled within the reporting period.
           8.3.3.3.3. CEMS shall compute and display the monthly NMCS percent on the end of
           month report.
           8.3.3.3.4. #ENMCS Engines (Monthly average) = NMCS Days ÷ # of days in
           reporting period
           8.3.3.3.5. #ENMCS Engines (Quarterly Average) = Sum of monthly ENMCS
           engines ÷ 3
       8.3.3.4. Metric Interpretation:
           8.3.3.4.1. Green = Less than 10% ENMCS
           8.3.3.4.2. Red =10% or more ENMCS.
8.4. Reliability.
   8.4.1. ATOW and MTBR: ATOW and MTBR are similar metrics that provide a macro-
   level indication of whole-engine and engine component reliability.
66                                                     AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014


     8.4.1.1. Metric Description: Time on wing is the fundamental indicator of an engine’s
     reliability. An effective maintenance plan based upon principles of RCM will increase
     the time on wing of an engine to the hardware’s inherent capability. MAJCOMs, Depots,
     and field units will use ATOW or MTBR as the primary metric to measure RCM
     effectiveness and overall engine reliability health.
        8.4.1.1.1. Total and inherent ATOW or MTBR shall be reported by the Engine TMS
        manager. Both measures will exclude all serviceable built up removals. The inherent
        ATOW or MTBR will also exclude removals for Foreign Object Damage (FOD),
        fuel/oil contamination (non-engine related), and other maintenance faults exclusive of
        the design.
     8.4.1.2. Metric Methodology:
        8.4.1.2.1. Engine programs can use either MTBR or ATOW to measure reliability.
        MTBR is used to measure whole-engine or engine component reliability and ATOW
        is used to measure whole-engine reliability. The goals for MTBR and ATOW are the
        same. Reliability reports will be titled to reflect the method selected.
        8.4.1.2.2. MTBR is defined as: MTBR = EFHfleet ÷ #removals, where engine flying
        hours for the fleet (EFHfleet) and number of engine/engine component removals were
        captured over some period of time, typically each quarter year.
        8.4.1.2.3. ATOW shall be calculated as: ATOW = ∑ EFHremoved_engine ÷
        #removals, where ∑ EFHremoved_engine is the sum of flying hours since the last
        removal on only the engines removed in a given quarter. This shall be calculated
        manually as CEMS and Propulsion Actuarial Client/Server (PACS) do not
        automatically report this number.
        8.4.1.2.4. Quarterly data from CEMS shall be used for EFH and number of removals.
        EFHs are found on CEMS product G232, Aircraft Engine Experience Analysis
        Report. Removals shall be obtained from CEMS product G341, Aircraft Engine
        Removal and Loss Report.
        8.4.1.2.5. ATOW or MTBR shall be calculated quarterly by the Engine TMS actuary,
        using a four (4) quarter rolling average to smooth any seasonal variation, and posted
        on                the               Actuary             SharePoint                site
        (https://cs.eis.afmc.af.mil/sites/1287/act/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.a
        spx).
            8.4.1.2.5.1. MTBR or ATOW will be undefined if no engines are removed in a
            quarter; therefore, such quarters shall be ignored in the four quarter rolling
            average calculation.
        8.4.1.2.6. For each TMS, Total and Inherent reliability value shall be reported for
        each quarter. If the ATOW methodology is used to represent reliability for an engine
        TMS, then the Total and Inherent reliability values shall be represented as total
        ATOW and inherent ATOW. If the MTBR methodology is used to represent
        reliability for an engine program, then the Total and Inherent reliability values shall
        be represented as total MTBR and inherent MTBR.
AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014                                                               67


       8.4.1.2.7. Total and Inherent reliability values shall be calculated the same way when
       using ATOW or MTBR. Total and Inherent reliability values differ based upon what
       removals are counted.
       8.4.1.2.8. Total reliability shall be calculate using all removals reported in CEMS
       except Transaction Condition Code LB = Serviceable Depot Removable.
       8.4.1.2.9. Inherent reliability shall be calculated by excluding all non-inherent (or
       induced) removals. Non-inherent removals shall be either those with Transaction
       Condition Code LB or with the HOW MAL Codes (HMCs) shown in Figure 8.2
       below.
       8.4.1.2.10. Engine TMS managers shall optimize Inherent reliability. SEMs shall be
       trained in the procedures for reporting accurate data.
       8.4.1.2.11. TCTO compliance may be scheduled or unscheduled maintenance usually
       to correct or mitigate design problems and therefore will be chargeable to the engine
       Inherent reliability. All TCTO removals shall be included in Inherent reliability,
       unless transaction condition code LB applies.
       8.4.1.2.12. An “unserviceable removal” will be an action that drives the engine into
       I-level maintenance.
       8.4.1.2.13. The lead MAJCOM/A4 is responsible for resolving inaccurate reporting
       of engine removals.

      8.4.1.3. Metric Interpretation:
         8.4.1.3.1. IDR provides a baseline for establishing a TMSs reliability goal in
         collaboration with the Lead MAJCOM.
         8.4.1.3.2. The IDR for immature fleets (<500,000EFH) / populations shall be
         determined by using the engine’s first run interval, where the first run interval is the
         anticipated average EFH on all engines when first removed for maintenance,
         including UERs. Deviations are authorized for the use of a higher number when
         major upgrades are incorporated or a lower number when thrust is increased.
         8.4.1.3.3. The IDR for mature fleets (>500,000EFH) / populations determination, (if
         historical data is not sufficient or applicable to determine the first run interval,
         inherent reliability) shall be assumed to be such that 10% of the engines are currently
         on wing longer than the inherent reliability. This will be done using a recent time-on-
         wing histogram and locating the 90th percentile.
AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                   69


         8.4.1.3.4. Engine TMS managers shall submit their IDR with justification and a
         graph of the ATOW or MTBR metric looking back three (3) years through the Senior
         Engineering Leader for Propulsion to the DoP for approval.
         8.4.1.3.5. Engine TMS managers shall submit to the DoP a graph of Total ATOW or
         MTBR and Inherent ATOW or MTBR, with a color rating based on the inherent
         ATOW or MTBR relative to the goal established in collaboration and agreement with
         the Lead MAJCOM.

Table 8.2. ATOW or MTBR Color Rating


      Green = Inherent ATOW or MTBR> Goal Established by Lead MAJCOM

      Yellow = Inherent ATOW or MTBR is less than 100% of goal and greater than75% of goal

      Red = Inherent ATOW or MTBR is less than 75% of goal


             8.4.1.3.5.1. The IDR shall be calculated using "hours since base maintenance" for
             the past three years as reported in the CEMS G341Q Data, Aircraft Engine
             Removal and Loss Report, excluding non-inherent (or induced) removals.
             Note: the IDR workbook located on the AFLCMC Actuarial EIM (SharePoint)
             web site will generate a histogram of this data locating the 90 percentile, which is
             consistent with assuming that 10% of the engines are currently on wing longer
             than the inherent reliability.
             8.4.1.3.5.2. The Engine TMS manager shall initially establish a baseline MTBR
             goal at 67% of IDR. In coordination with MAJCOMs the MTBR goal shall be
             updated based on relevant information from sources such as removal trends, top
             removal drivers, forthcoming CIP incorporations, Propulsion PSIP enhancements,
             RCM decisions, build policies and EHM enhancements to adjust MTBR goals up
             or down accordingly.
  8.4.2. SVR: The SVR is another indicator used to measure a TMS’s reliability. This
  indicator shall track the number of engines removed from aircraft and subsequently sent to an
  intermediate maintenance shop or a depot for repair.
     8.4.2.1. Metric Methodology: The number of engines removed from aircraft for all
     reasons (SER + UER + TCTO ER) and subsequently sent to an intermediate maintenance
     shop or a depot for repair within a time interval divided by the EFH within the same
     interval, multiplied by 1000.
     8.4.2.2. Metric Interpretation: The total SVR shall be considered inverse of the total
     ATOW or total MTBR; therefore the goals for total SV will be the inverse of those goals
     listed for the total ATOW or total MTBR.

     by the applicable T.O. within a time interval divided by the EFH within the same interval,
     multiplied by 1000.
  8.4.4. UERs: The UER rate is a trend metric, therefore this indicator will be presented to
  show the historical trend of UER.
     8.4.4.1. Metric Description: UER are removals caused by an inherent engine
     malfunction(s). Engine removals resulting from TCTO inspections performed with
     engine uninstalled is classified as UER.
     8.4.4.2. Metric Methodology: The number of engines removed from aircraft and
     subsequently sent to an intermediate maintenance shop or a depot for repair divided by
     the EFH within the same interval, multiplied by 1000.

     8.4.5.1. Metric Description: LRU rate measures the number of times an LRU must be
     removed or replaced because of an inherent malfunction or time change requirement.
     The metric shall show the historical trend of LRUs.
     8.4.5.2. Metric Methodology:
         8.4.5.2.1. The number of components on each TMS’s specified LRU list which are
         removed or replaced at the organizational level of maintenance as result of an
         inherent malfunction or time change requirements within the time interval divided by
         the EFH within the same interval, multiplied by 1000.
         8.4.5.2.2. The LRU removals caused by an inherent malfunction or out of limit
         condition which cannot be duplicated by subsequent investigations at shop/depot, and
         does not occur in subsequent operation shall not be counted.
         8.4.5.2.3. Multiple identical LRUs removed or replaced at the same time shall be
         considered as a single event. If LRUs fail independently, each failure shall be
         counted separately.
         8.4.5.2.4. The LRU removal rate shall be as reported in the REMIS G099 “Health of
         Weapon System” Report in the LRU line divided by the EFH within the same
         interval, multiplied by 1000.
         8.4.5.2.5. The specified list of LRUs shall be those that are considered “chargeable”
         to the engine. This list is found in the –06 list of Work Unit Codes (WUC) for each
         engine. The Algorithm that will be used by REMIS G099 is as follows:
             8.4.5.2.5.1. If a WUC from the specified LRU list is entered into IMDS/G081
             and has a chargeable HOWMAL Code (as listed as being chargeable to the LRU
             rate in Appendix A of PCoE Best Practice 00-09) and the action take code is P or
AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                   71


              R then, the TMS LRU rate shall be charged for that event (quantity: one per
              replaced LRU per JCN).
   8.4.6. Abort Rate: This indicator shall measure the impact of an engine’s reliability on the
   user’s ability to complete their mission.
       8.4.6.1. Metric Description: Aborts for engine causes are chargeable to this metric. This
       indicator shall show the historical trend of Aborts.
       8.4.6.2. Metric Methodology: The number of aborts for engine cause within a time
       interval divided by the EFH within the same interval, multiplied by 1000. Note: The
       number of aborts can be found on line 5 of the REMIS G099 “Health of Weapons System
       (HOWS)” Report, titled TOTAL ABORTS.

       O & I Level Maintenance + CIP & Modifications) ÷ EFHs
       8.6.1.3. Metric Methodology:
          8.6.1.3.1. Information required for calculation will be obtained from a variety of
          sources; e.g., CEMS, Air Force Total Ownership Cost (AFTOC) database, CIP Funds
          Manager, Modification Program Funds monitor.
AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                 73

       Improvement Group (CAIG) elements (https://aftoc.hill.af.mil): Depot Level
       Reparables (Flying DLR) – CAIG element 2.3.1, Consumables (GSD) – CAIG
       element 2.2.1, Depot Maintenance (not DLRs) – CAIG element 4.0, Organizational
       Maintenance – CAIG element 1.2.1, and Intermediate Level Maintenance – CAIG
       element 1.2.2.
       8.6.1.3.3. CIP investment costs (3600 funds) shall be obtained from the CIP
       Manager.
       8.6.1.3.4. Modification costs (3010 funds) shall be obtained from all funding sources
       and added to the calculation.
       8.6.1.3.5. Engine Flying Hours shall be as reported in CEMS and available on the
       Propulsion          Sustainment         Division’s       Actuarial      Webpage
       (https://org.eis.afmc.af.mil/sites/639acsg/default.aspx)   for     each  Engine
       Management Group.
       8.6.1.3.6. Once cost information is obtained from AFTOC for a given TMS it shall
       be inflated to Current Year dollars. Inflation indices shall be IAW AFI 65-503 US
       Air Force Cost and Planning Factors, Inflation Indices (A45-1 through A49-1). Note:
       Indices are superseded in January of each year when new tables are issued. A
       separate inflation rate is identified for each fund appropriation and year. For 3400,
       3600 and 3010 funds use the weighted index.
       8.6.1.3.7. The Engine TMS manager shall establish the baseline for each TMS using
       the 2 to 5 (depending on accuracy of AFTOC data) previous year’s data (initially
       establish using FY01 thru FY05). The baseline shall be used to establish the Goal for
       each TMS; taking into consideration known work-scope changes and projected
       reliability. Note: A standard methodology for projecting the future does not exist.
       However, inputs to be considered include the age of the engine and the standard
       work-scope to be accomplished at the next scheduled maintenance event.
       Investments for engine upgrades and modifications will result in increased costs and
       improved reliability in the future. An estimate of when the improved reliability will
       occur should be reflected in the TMS Goal.
          8.6.1.3.7.1. Accuracy of AFTOC data for the Depot Maintenance (CAIG Element
          4.0) shall be verified by comparing to actual historical data. Each fiscal year
          whole engine input schedule and sales price shall be checked. If the resulting
          amount is within +/- 5% of the AFTOC amount, no further action is required. If
          the variance exceeds +/- 5%, then the actual historical data shall be used.
          Note: Notify AFTOC and the MAJCOM of the discrepancy and request a review
          by AFTOC to determine the source of the discrepancy.
          8.6.1.3.7.2. An analysis of the historical data shall be conducted to ensure that the
          most accurate material costs are used. If the material cost varied significantly
          from year to year and did not correspond with your ERRB and System
          Requirement Review Board (SRRB) inputs, discretion in selecting appropriate
          years to establish the baseline and forecast projections is authorized.

             Note: Material cost are influenced by multiple factors including changes in
             pricing formulas for Stock Fund and Depot Maintenance Activity Group (DMAG)
             process, raw materials (specialty metals) cost increases and DMAG repair cost
             increases in excess of ERRB forecast.
      8.6.1.4. Metric Interpretation: In coordination with MAJCOM/A4s and PM, the Engine
      TMS manager shall determine the ETOC goal.

                   ENGINE LEADING HEALTH INDICATORS (LHIS)

9.1. General. This chapter directs the LHI process for propulsion systems health reporting and
the criteria for evaluating these indicators. Applicability of this quarterly process is to assess
future WRE outlook. The objective is to drive a desired program behavior with standardized risk
identification and provide leadership a comprehensive overview of readiness and sustainment
issues. The indicators shall be organized by the capability or attribute that they are intended to
measure. There are six (6) elements that trigger changes in WRE outlook: Requirements,
Production, Supportability, Safety/Quality, Operational Trends, and Funding/Resources. (See
figure 9.1.)
   9.1.1. The Engine TMS manager is accountable to the DoP for status and information
   collected from stakeholders.
   9.1.2. Engine TMS managers shall complete an LHI checklist quarterly within the FY and
   update with current data as applicable.
   9.1.2.1. Engine TMS managers shall coordinate with Lead MAJCOM/A4M, Sustainment
   activities, PM, and other stakeholders as required when performing LHI checklist and
   accessing program status.
       9.1.2.2. Each element shall be assigned a red or green rating based on 6, 12, and 36
       months impact to WRE. The Engine TMS manager shall assign the rating based on
       overarching risk to fleet health using the complete checklist as a tool:
           9.1.2.2.1. Rate each checklist sub-element to assist in determining the overall
           element rating. In the Response column, provide justification for the suggested
           rating. Ensure justification references the sub-element and can stand alone as a bullet
           as back-up.
           9.1.2.2.2. Rate elements red if not corrected within lead-time or extreme measures
           are required to fix the problem.
           9.1.2.2.3. Rate elements green if no issues are projected within lead-time (e.g., future
           POM to cover issue).
   9.1.3. The overall Engine TMS engine rating shall be based on the Engine TMS manager’s
   cumulative subjective assessment and presented to the DoP. The DoP is accountable for the
   resolution action plan.
       9.1.3.1. There is no set rule for how many reds or greens make an overall element red or
       green; the Engine TMS manager shall determine based on impacts to WRE.
       9.1.3.2. If the rating is red, the sub-element of: (W) –Watch, (I) – Investigating, (A) –
       Action shall be identified.
       9.1.3.3. Briefing charts:
           9.1.3.3.1. Change to rated LHI elements will be indicated by an oval circle on the
           LHI Overview briefing chart.
AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                 77


         9.1.3.3.2. Red rated elements requiring action shall have backup slide(s) that clearly
         identify the problem, impact, and mitigation plan.

Factor—A value used in assessments and in computing requirements. Factors are developed for
peace (readiness), and for war (surge and sustained).
Forecasted Factors—Factors developed which predict what the official factors will be when the
engine has reached stability. Forecast factors are used to predict the total number of engines
required to support the weapons system throughout its life cycle.

          COMPUTATION OF ENGINE INTERMEDIATE REPAIR REQUIREMENTS

A2.1. (Line 1) Engine Hours – Peace: All whole engine repair requirement computations begin
with the flying hours for the engine and Major Command (MAJCOM) being projected. These
flying hours represent the peacetime flying hours projected for the engine and are based on the
PA tape received from Air Staff. Known overfly hours approved by MAJCOM OPR must be
included to project a realistic repair requirement.

A2.2. (Line 2) ARI Factor: For the purposes of calculating the Intermediate Level Maintenance
engine repair requirement, the Base Maintenance Removal Interval (BMRI) is used. The BMRI
reflects the average number of flying hours between engine removals requiring Jet Engine
Intermediate Maintenance (JEIM) repair supported by Intermediate Repair locations, e.g.
Centralized Repair Facility (CRF), Engine Regional Repair Center (ERRC), Back-shops, or other
off-equipment (Intermediate) repair locations. Note: When completing Steps A4.3. thru A4.12
consideration must be made for engines with Intermediate repair verses depot repair to ensure
factors are not duplicated. Duplication will cause an inflated total repair requiremen
A2.3. (Line 3) Usage Change: The result of this calculation (Line 1 divided by Line 2)
represents a computed number of engines removed from an aircraft requiring a JEIM repair
action. If a TMS is supported by a depot whole engine overhaul computation, this will be the
JEIM repair requirement, and lines 4 through 13 are not required.
A2.4. (Line 4) Base Stockage Objective: (Non-applicable to TMS engines with a depot
program.) The Base Stock Level (BSL) objective represents the number of engines a MAJCOM
AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                       89


is required to have available or “in stock” at their installations. BSL can be either computed by
the PRS or negotiated by the Engine TMS manager and MAJCOM.
A2.5. (Line 5) Safety Level Requirement: (Non-applicable to JEIM computations.)
A2.6. (Line 6, 1st Column) Beginning Inventory (Non-applicable to TMS engines with a
depot program. ) The beginning inventory represents the actual MAJCOM spare asset quantity
at the end of the period prior to the time frame being computed.
A2.7. (Line 6) Total Stockage Requirement: (Non-applicable to TMS engines with a depot
program.) In addition to the whole engines required to support the projected flying hour program,
a certain number are needed to maintain a MAJCOM BSL.
A2.8. (Line 7) Asset Variance: (Non-applicable to TMS engines with a depot program.) The
total stockage requirement is compared to the assets on hand or projected to be on hand at the
beginning of the period being calculated (end of the previous quarter). The delta between the
requirement and the beginning inventory represents the additional engines that must be repaired
to maintain the stock level. If more engines are in the inventory at the beginning of a
computation period than are required to meet the stock level of the MAJCOM, these assets can
be used to offset either the flying hour requirement or other obligations. This calculation will
normally only result in a delta during the first quarter of the computation or of a fiscal year since
a new BSL is only established once a year.
A2.9. (Lines 8 and 9) Serviceable Obligation–Loss and Serviceable Obligation–
Other: (Non-applicable to TMS engines with a depot program.) Engines may also be obligated
for other uses which will increase the overhaul requirement. Serviceable Obligation–Loss refers
to those serviceable assets that have been obligated to another use such as a training requirement
or a FMS customer. Serviceable Obligation–Other represents those serviceable assets that have
been obligated to another service within the DOD, payback to another MAJCOM, Programmed
Depot Maintenance (PDM), etc.
A2.10. (Line 10) Gross Overhaul Requirements: (Non-applicable to TMS engines with a
depot program.) The Gross Overhaul Requirement is calculated using the sum of the following:
   A2.10.1. Engines required supporting the peacetime flying hour program (Line 3).
   A2.10.2. Assets required covering the difference between the BSL and the inventory on
   hand at the beginning of the period being computed (Line 7).
   A2.10.3. Engines obligated by the MAJCOM for another use (Lines 8 and 9).
A2.11. (Line 11) Projected Serviceable Receipts: (Non-applicable to TMS engines with a depot
program.) Prior to the calculation of the final (net) overhaul output requirement, the Gross
Overhaul Requirement is offset by any serviceable assets the MAJCOM expects to receive from
any source (e.g., new production, return of low time assets from AMARG, etc.).
A2.12. (Line 12) Net Overhaul Requirements: (Non-applicable to TMS engines with a depot
program.) The net overhaul requirement is the Gross Repair Requirement (Line 10) offset by the
Projected Serviceable Receipts (Line 11). This requirement represents the number of engines that
must be available as output from the intermediate repair facility to satisfy all of the MAJCOMs
requirements for that engine during the period.

                   ENGINE CIP SCORECARD PROCESS GUIDANCE

A3.1. Consistent with the USAF Engine Health Indicator/Metrics (EHI/M) guidance of Chapter
8, this scorecard will serve as a tool for the DoP Propulsion Division Chiefs, and lead
MAJCOMs to reach funding decisions regarding candidate projects and tasks. The scorecard is
not the sole determinant, but rather one tool to help guide this decision process.
A3.2. All propulsion systems are monitored for the health of their programs using operationally
relevant health metrics of Safety, Availability, Reliability, Maintainability and Affordability
compared to customer identified goals. The CIP is utilized to address shortfalls and develop
strategy plans which are documented in the individual ELMP. Candidate CIP tasks can be
identified from a variety of means including:
   A3.2.1. Operationally identified deficiencies surfaced through mishap and deficiency
   reports.
   A3.2.2. Maintenance data trends.
   A3.2.3. Test and evaluation programs including accelerated mission tests, lead the fleet
   programs and analytical inspections.
   A3.2.4. Depot maintenance and repair improvements.
   A3.2.5. Top material cost drivers as identified by the AFTOC system. AFTOC is the
   authoritative source across the Air Force for financial, acquisition, and logistics information.
A3.3. Process Guidance: The scoring process is composed of two parts as shown in Figure
A3.1
   A3.3.1. The TMS CIP manager will generate a candidate project/task list which will be
   scored by the objective criteria listed below.
   A3.3.2. The subjective prioritization of those candidate projects/tasks will be conducted by
   the TMS team (consists of the CIP Manager, TMS CIP Manager, and applicable lead
   MAJCOM TMS and IEMP representatives at a minimum), Propulsion Division Chiefs, and
   lead MAJCOMs.
   A3.3.3. TMS team (all stakeholders) shall provide their rankings prior to the ECWG
   meetings.
       A3.3.3.1. The TMS team, Propulsion Division Chiefs, and lead MAJCOM will rank each
       item on the task list from 0-5 (5 being highest and 0 the lowest).
       A3.3.3.2. The TMS team:
          A3.3.3.2.1. The CIP Manager is responsible for collecting and reconciling the TMS
          team inputs.
          A3.3.3.2.2. For MAJCOM rankings, the lead MAJCOM/A4 (or as delegated) provide
          these rankings.
          A3.3.3.2.3. Propulsion Division Chiefs, and lead MAJCOMs may allocate their
          priorities across all the engines in their portfolio.
92                                                        AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014


             A3.3.3.2.3.1. To provide maximum discrimination, each rater is asked to place an
             equal number of tasks within each rank (5 down to 0).
             A3.3.3.2.3.2. Lead MAJCOM and Propulsion Division Chiefs rankings are then
             converted into a score from 0-5 and added to the objective score to generate a
             total score.
  A3.3.4. Propulsion Division Chiefs and lead MAJCOM rankings are required in time to be
  incorporated into the combined master project/task list, which will then be distributed prior to
  the EAB. Specific timelines will be communicated separately.
  A3.3.5. This section provides specific guidance on the categorizing and scoring of projects
  and tasks. The scoring criteria are presented in Table A3.1 and a scoring sample is provided
  in Table A3.2.
     A3.3.5.1. As much as possible, combine non-separable items into one project/task (e.g.
     include all costs of a given test into one scored project – test costs at Government facility,
     fuel, contractor support, etc.)
     A3.3.5.2. Do not lump separable items into one all-encompassing project/task (e.g., do
     not put multiple tests into one large test task). As a general rule, if parts of a project or
     task would warrant different scores, they should be scored as separate projects or tasks.
  A3.3.6. Non-scored projects/tasks:
     A3.3.6.1. The following types of efforts constitute general program support and are not
     scored. These tasks will be identified on the task scorecard as “PM” (Program
     Management) type tasks. This is not to be confused with risk reduction efforts, which are
     program content (see guidance below). The use of these categories and dollar amounts
     should be absolutely the bare minimum required. See Chapter 8, Engine Health
     Indicators/Indicators Metrics, for summary definitions.
         A3.3.6.1.1. “PM”: (a) Award Fee (if applicable), (b) General Product Support (not
         linked to a scored task), (c) MILSTRIP, (d) Minor common support (e.g., test
         equipment and data management)
     A3.3.6.2. The following types of risk reduction activities will not be scored. These tasks
     will be identified on task scorecard as “RR” (Risk Reduction) type tasks:
         A3.3.6.2.1. “RR”: (a) LtF/ACI, (b) AMT (w/o task validation – See A3.3.7. below
         for AMT w/task validation), (c) Mission analysis, (d) Parts life analysis
  A3.3.7. The TMS risk reduction efforts/plans will be presented at the ECWG meetings and
  then consolidated for the entire propulsion community for presentation/approval at the ELMP
  review. Approved elements will be shown above the cut line at the EAB; non-approved
  elements will be shown below the cut line. Depending upon available funding and other
  issues, items may be moved above/below the cut line at the EAB.
  A3.3.8. Scored projects and tasks:
     A3.3.8.1. Each distinct effort (project or task) will be scored relative to the TMS health
     status it is targeted to improve. Use the health metric that most justifies doing the project
     or task to arrive at the score for these criteria. If more than one targeted metric is
     currently rated “Yellow” or “Red,” use the metric resulting in the highest score justifying
AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                  93


     the proposed project or task. DoP health metrics are defined in Chapter 8, Engine Health
     Indicators.
     A3.3.8.2. Tasks that are common across multiple TMSs are to be rated against the worst
     case health metric status for all the TMSs affected.
        A3.3.8.2.1. Validation tests (including AMTs used for validation) are scored the
        same way the projects(s)/task(s) being validated are scored - use the highest
        applicable project or task score.
        A3.3.8.2.2. Specific scorecard criteria are described below:
            A3.3.8.2.2.1. Category 1, Current Health Measure Status. Using the health
            measure that was targeted to be improved by implementing the project or task,
            assign the applicable score. Color rating of health metric is assigned according to
            criteria defined in Chapter 5, Engine Health Indicators. Specific goals are
            documented in the ELMP for each engine program.
            A3.3.8.2.2.2. Category 2, Projected Health Measure Status. Using the projected
            status of the health measure that was targeted to be improved by the task, assign
            the applicable score. The projected health measure status should look five years
            into the future based on current funded implementation efforts. Do not include
            any benefits from the proposed new task list. Benefits from the proposed new
            CIP tasks will be accounted for on the applicable “TMS CIP Requirements
            Summary” slide. In specific instances where five years is an insufficient
            timeframe, a longer range projection can be recommended – annotate any
            instances where the five-year projection is not used. Color rating criteria is to be
            IAW requirements defined in Chapter 8, Engine Health Indicators. Specific goals
            are documented in the ELMP for each engine program.
            A3.3.8.2.2.3. Category 3, Safety Risk Item. If the CIP task has been initiated to
            address a red safety risk item, the task will earn points. An item is a red safety
            risk item if corrective action is required per Table 8.1, Chapter 8 Engine Health
            Indicators.
            A3.3.8.2.2.4. Category 4, Carry-Over/New Task. If the CIP task was initiated and
            funded in prior year(s) it is classified as a carry-over. If the task is new, it is
            considered a new start.
            A3.3.8.2.2.5. Category 5, Technical Risk. If the proposed corrective action being
            proposed has been designed and approved for use on other USAF systems, the
            technical risk is less. The Technology Readiness Level (TRL) definitions are
            used to assign ratings per Table A3.3.
            A3.3.8.2.2.6. Category 6, Benefits/Improvements. Each CIP task should be based
            on the customer’s request to improve one of the health metrics; however, since a
            task can affect more than one metric (e.g., Safety and WRE), this category allows
            tasks to earn points for their benefits to each metric. Tasks can score points for
            improvements to any of the metrics (a maximum of 5 points total). Consult the
            Scoring Summary Table for specific score values/criteria for each metric.
            A3.3.8.2.2.7. Category 7, Implementation Plan Resources. Points for this
94                                              AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014


     category will be based upon the status of implementation resources. Approved
     means that the required resources to implement the output product of the CIP task
     have been approved by the lead MAJCOM in Engine Requirements Review
     Board (ERRB) and SRRB (for 3400), or the future MAJCOM POM (for 3010).
     Projected means that the implementation plan has been developed by the MPWG
     and included in the ELMP (3400), or is being submitted in the POM (3010).
     However, a projected status will not be shown indefinitely. Once a task has met
     the ERRB/SRRB and/or been through the POM process, if implementation
     funding has not been approved, it can no longer be considered as projected and
     will receive no points in this category. Upon subsequent re-submittal and
     approval, it would then be considered approved.
     A3.3.8.2.2.8. Category 8, TMS Life Remaining. Each CIP task will earn points
     based on the TMS length of life remaining. For engine models with multiple
     series of engines, use the series with the most years remaining to score all tasks,
     unless the task is applicable to only one series that has fewer years of life
     remaining.
     A3.3.8.2.2.9. Category 9. Multi-Engine Benefits. If more than one engine TMS
     benefits from a CIP task, it can earn 2 to 5 extra points depending on the number
     of engine TMS’s it benefits.

            ENGINE CIP FAIR SHARE RATE COMPUTATION GUIDANCE

A4.1. Purpose: The CIP is a sustainment engineering effort intended to address the long-term
needs of the propulsion systems, through engine safety, reliability and maintainability
enhancement tasks supported through yearly contracts with the engine Original Equipment
Manufacturers (OEM). The CIP is a multi-faceted program that combines efforts of the Life
Cycle Management Center, Type Model Series (TMS) Engineering Function, Major Commands
(MAJCOMs) and in many cases the US Navy and International partners who operate US made
weapon systems. Based on the fact that the CIP is a cross service program with international
participation, the roles/responsibilities along with critical processes must be defined and
documented for consistence and equitable implementation based on benefits.
A4.2. Roles and Responsibilities
A4.2.1. DoP: Provides the guidance on Fair Share Rate computation process.

A4.2.2. AF CIP Manager: implements the Fair Share Rate computation guidance.
Responsibilities include:

       A4.2.2.1. Every October, solicit the active engine inventory as of 1 January each year
       from (Engine Sustainment Operations Office, International Engine Management Program
       (IEMP) office, and the Navy.
       A4.2.2.2. Determine the final fair share rate using the contracted task amounts and active
       engine inventory as of 1 January of the execution year. Issue the final fair share letter to
       the IEMP office for funding.
A4.2.3. Engine Inventory Manager: Maintains USAF engine inventory data, both active and
inactive and provides the data to AF CIP Manager upon request. Source of data is CEMS.

A4.2.4. IEMP: Is an AF program, chartered to support the follow-on technical and logistical
needs of participating international users through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process.
This support includes the management of international participation in the CIP program, as
governed by the AFMAN 16-101, International Affairs and Security Assistance Management.
Responsibilities include, but are not limited to:

       A4.2.4.1. The yearly collection and documentation of international engine inventories,
       both active and inactive. The IEMP will solicit participating members in October to
       obtain the international partner inventory, as of 1 January each calendar year. These
       inventories will be provided to the AF CIP Manager.
       A4.2.4.2. The IEMP will maintain line management authority over participating
       members Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) lines for CIP participation. After
       contract award, the AF CIP Manager will issue the final fair share letter to IEMP. IEMP
       will provide funding through the AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization, process within
       45 days of receipt of the fair share letter, or by 2 January, whichever comes later.

       A4.2.4.3. The IEMP will participate in CIP task development and the TMS Team
       ranking process. Each year the IEMP will solicit international users for potential CIP
       tasks. During the annual CIP TMS engineering meetings, the IEMP will attend along
       with international partners and participate along with the AF TMS engineer in evaluating
       and determining CIP task benefits.
A4.3. Rules of Inventory Participation. Since the CIP is a cost share program, with funding
requirements being determined based on users engine inventory count as of 1 January each
calendar year, it is important to understand that engines can and are maintained in various states.
Dependent upon which state and engine is classified determines if that engine would be
considered for CIP fair share funding. Rules for determining an engine status are listed below:
A4.3.1. Active Engine Inventory. Active engines are those identified as being active for service
within a user’s fleet. Only engines in an active status receive CIP benefits through the
incorporation of Engineering Changes (ECs) developed under the CIP program. Inventory of
active engines as of 1 January will be used to compute the fair share rate for that year.

A4.3.2 Inactive Engine Inventory. Inactive engines are those engines that are not expected to
receive EC implementation for a variety of reasons, and will not be included in yearly inventory
counts used to determine the CIP fair share rates. Examples of inactive engines include:

A4.3.2.1. Destroyed engines/modules

A4.3.2.2 Static engine/module displays

A4.3.2.3. Engines/modules in non-recoverable storage

A4.3.2.4. Engines/modules designated for long-term parts cannibalization

A4.3.2.5. USAF engines stored at AMARG

A4.3.2.6. nternational engines stored in an AMARG-like condition (Refer to AFMAN 16-101
for additional guidance.

A4.3.3. Transfer of engines from active to inactive inventory and vice versa. Based on mission
requirements, engines can be moved from active inventory to inactive inventory during the year.
However, active inventory at the beginning of each calendar year will be used in fair share
computation. Fair shares will not be recomputed during the year for movement of engines
between active and inactive inventories or any other reasons, such as changes in task costs during
execution year.

A4.3.4. Equivalent Engine. When a new series is created off of a TMS for some minor
configuration changes, the new series, for CIP funding purposes, may be considered as a
percentage (say 85%) equivalent to the original TMS (determined by TMS engineering in
coordination with IEMP). The percentage equivalency is used to compute an equivalent
inventory for the new series, which is used to determine the CIP contribution amount. For
AFMAN20-116 7 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                   101


example: F110-132 series is 75% equivalent to F110-129 TMS and has an active inventory of 84.
F110-132 will participate in the fair share as F110-129 with F110-129 equivalent inventory of 63
(84 x 0.75) engines.

A4.4. Computation of Fair Share Rate. The fair share rate of a TMS provides a common cost
basis for computing the CIP contribution amount of each participating member commensurate
with its engine inventory for that TMS. Examples of cost pool, TMS Fair Share Rates and Fair
Share Rate Computations can be found in Appendix A4.1:
A4.4.1. Cost Pool. The methodology used in computing fair share rates follows the accounting
principles used in job costing. CIP tasks are grouped in cost pools depending on TMS or group
of TMSs they provide benefits to. The total cost of a cost pool is equally allocated to the
worldwide inventory of TMS or TMSs benefiting from that cost pool.
Cost per engine in a pool = (Cost of all tasks in the pool) ÷ (Total number of engines of all TMSs
in the pool)

A4.4.2. TMS Fair Share Rate. The fair share rate of a TMS will be the sum of per engine cost of
all cost pools in which the TMS is included. If a TMS benefits from say three cost pools, its fair
share rate will be the sum of per engine allocation from those three cost pools. TMS Fair Share
Rate = Sum of per engine cost allocations of all cost pools in which the TMS is included

   A4.4.3. Country Contribution Amount for a TMS. TMS Contribution Amount = (TMS Fair
   Share Rate) x (Country’s TMS Active Engine Inventory) as of 1 January of CIP calendar
   year.
