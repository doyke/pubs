                           GENERAL INFORMATION
                                    Overview

Introduction      This handbook serves as a guide for applying the Instructional
                  System Development (ISD) process to the planning, design,
                  development, implementation and management of unit training in
                  the Air Force. It adheres to the policies of AFPD 36-22 and
                  follows the principles and procedures outlined in AFMAN 36-
                  2234. It is intended to be an easy reading guide for both novice
                  and experienced curriculum developers or individuals involved in
                  conducting and managing unit training and on-the-job training
                  (OJT). While it is designed as a "stand-alone" document, you
                  should read and be familiar with AFPD 36-22 and AFMAN 36-
                  2234. You should also be familiar with the training development
                  documents referenced in this handbook, as applicable.


Background        In the past, the Air Force ISD manual and pamphlet were focused
                  on how ISD applied to technical training. There was little or no
                  guidance on applying the ISD process to other areas such as
                  aircrew training, acquisition, education, unit training or on-the job
                  training. The revised AFMAN 36-2234 provides the guidance and
                  procedures necessary for applying the ISD process throughout
                  the Air Force, regardless of the type of education or training being
                  developed. The various volumes of AFH 36-2235 provide
                  specific guidance and procedures for applying ISD to aircrew
                  training, acquisition, education, and technical training as well as
                  unit training and on-the-job training. Other volumes of AFH
                  36-2235 have been developed to cover application of ISD in other
                  areas.


Purpose           This handbook provides specific information and guidance for
                  using the instructional development process to develop unit
                  training and OJT. It provides information on the ISD model,
                  planning for ISD projects, phases of the ISD process, system
                  functions, and quality improvements.
AFH 36-2235        Volume 11       1 November 2002                                           5




Is this handbook      This handbook addresses the question: "How do you apply the
for you?              ISD process in unit training?" It is applicable whether a
                      contractor or an Air Force team develops the training. But is it for
                      you? It is if you can answer yes to any of the following questions:

                      Are You Responsible For …                              Yes      No
                      Developing unit-training courseware?
                      Developing on-the-job training (OJT)?
                      Conducting unit training or OJT?
                      Managing or supervising unit training or OJT?
                      Are You …                                              Yes      No
                      A training manager, curriculum developer,
                             training supervisor or trainer with little or
                             no experience in ISD?
                      A subject matter expert (SME) with no ISD
                            experience?
                      An ISD expert (with at least five years'
                            experience with ISD)?
                      A novice or "entry-level" curriculum developer?
                      A new trainer or supervisor?


What is ISD?          ISD is a systematic but flexible process used to plan, design,
                      develop, and implement unit training and OJT programs in an
                      effective and cost-efficient manner. It is a total quality process
                      continuously striving to improve the overall education and training
                      programs. ISD ensures that:

                          There is an education and training need.
                          There is an effective and cost-efficient solution to the need.
                          The solution can be implemented.
                          The solution can be assessed to determine if it meets the
                          need.
                          Continuous quality improvements are made throughout the
                          process.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 11       1 November 2002                                           6



Basis for ISD        The ISD process used in the Air Force is based on:

                         Basic research on how individuals learn.
                         Basic research on how individuals communicate.
                         The systems engineering process.
                         The concepts of instructional technology.


Why use ISD?         Using the ISD process ensures that unit training and OJT
                     programs are both effective and cost-efficient. ISD requires that:

                         Training design meets specific job requirements that have
                         been identified through training needs assessments (TNA).
                         Training is designed for all job tasks and knowledge
                         necessary for successful performance on the job.
                         Training is designed to meet specific training objectives.
                         Methods and media are chosen to optimize effectiveness and
                         cost-efficiency.
                         Education and training programs are evaluated to ensure they
                         meet the objectives and revised if they fail to do so.
                         Trainee data is collected and used to improve the quality of
                         education and training programs.


Goal of ISD          The goal of ISD is to produce trainees who can perform their jobs
                     after receiving training and to reduce overall costs of the training
                     by accurately identifying training requirements.


How to use ISD       ISD is:

                         Flexible and systematic.
                         A tool to get the right training for the problem.
                         Not a lock step, linear process.


How to use this      This handbook is a guide to help plan, design, develop,
handbook             implement, conduct, evaluate, and manage unit training and OJT.
                     This handbook is used by first identifying the specific tasks or
                     activities to be done and then using the information provided in
                     the handbook to accomplish the task or activity. The following job
                     aid will assist in identifying the sections to be read to accomplish
                     specific tasks and activities.

                              Chapter 2
              INSTRUCTIONAL SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT MODEL
                                      Overview

Introduction        Planning, developing, delivering, supporting, and managing a
                    training system requires considerable time and effort on the part
                    of training managers, supervisors, trainers, and subject matter
                    experts (SMEs) such as maintenance supervisors, master
                    technicians, or crew chiefs and curriculum developers who make
                    up the unit training team. It should be noted that all of these
                    SMEs might not be available at all units. The unit training team is
                    responsible for conducting the necessary training needs
                    assessment (TNA) and designing, developing, implementing,
                    conducting, and evaluating the unit training and on-the-job
                    training (OJT) to ensure that performance requirements are being
                    met. The individual efforts of each team member ensure that
                    effective, cost-efficient training is developed and integrated into a
                    total training system using the principles of quality improvement
                    (QI). A total instructional system model includes the phases of
                    ISD, system functions, and the QI process. This chapter will
                    address each of these areas.


Objectives          The objectives of this chapter are to:

                        Define the phases of the ISD process.
                        Discuss the system functions.
                        Explain the QI process.


Updated Air Force   The updated ISD model has been designed to represent
ISD model           simplicity and flexibility so instructional developers with varying
                    levels of expertise can understand the model and use it to
                    develop effective, cost-efficient instructional systems. The model
                    also depicts the flexibility that team members have to enter or
                    reenter the various phases of the process as necessary. The
                    entry or reentry into a particular phase of the process is
                    determined by the nature and scope of the development, update,
                    or revision effort.
AFH 36-2235        Volume 11      1 November 2002                                           9



System functions      An extension of the system approach places the ISD process
                      within the functional design of a total instructional system.
                      Figure 1 shows the basic top-level system functions of the
                      instructional system: Management, Support, Administration,
                      Delivery, and Evaluation.

                      Figure 1 System Functions




What are they?        The system functions of the ISD model are:

                          Management—the function of directing or controlling
                          instructional system development and operations.
                          Support—the function of maintaining all parts of the system.
                          Administration—the function of day-to-day processing and
                          record keeping.
                          Delivery—the function of maintaining or presenting all parts of
                          the system.
                          Evaluation—the function of continuously gathering feedback
                          data through formative, summative, and operational
                          evaluations to assess system and trainee performance.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 11      1 November 2002                                       10



Relation to ISD      Using these essential functions to design the overall instructional
                     system architecture and then allocating them to the respective
                     instructional system components, or people responsible, ensures
                     that these functions are operational when the total training
                     system is fielded. ISD products are integrated into the total
                     instructional system, and aspects of the system functions are
                     active throughout all phases of the ISD process.

                     Figure 2 shows the phases most often used in the system
                     approach; Analysis, Design, Development, and Implementation,
                     with continuous Evaluation activities integrated into each phase
                     of the process. The phases are embedded within the system
                     functions. Evaluation is shown as the central "feedback network"
                     for the total system.

                     The instructional development process, which the model
                     summarizes, calls for instructional developers to:

                         Analyze and determine what instruction is needed.
                         Design instruction to meet the need.
                         Develop instructional materials to support system
                         requirements.
                         Implement the instructional system.

Relation to ISD      Evaluation or feedback is a central function that continuously
(Continued)          takes place throughout each phase of the ISD process.

                     Symbolically, Figure 2 shows that all phases of the model depend
                     on each of the other phases. The ISD process allows the
                     curriculum developer or development team to enter or reenter the
                     various phases of the process as determined by the nature and
                     scope of the development activity. The phases of the model are
                     described below.


Analysis phase       In courses tying the content directly to preparing a trainee to do a
                     job, the curriculum developer or development team analyzes the
                     job performance requirements and develops a task list. The
                     developer then analyzes the job tasks and compares them with
                     the skills, knowledge, and attitudes of the incoming trainees. The
                     difference between what they already know and can do and what
                     the job requires them to know and be able to do determines what
                     instruction is necessary. In this phase, the formative evaluation
                     activities begin.

                         Example: Conducting an initial skills interview with a trainee
                         or duty position interview.


Design phase         In the design phase, the curriculum developer or team develops a
                     detailed plan of instruction including the selection of instructional
                     methods and media, and determining instructional strategies.
                     Existing instructional materials are reviewed during the phase to
                     determine their applicability.

                         Example: Compare work center requirements and duty
                         position requirements to the members' STS or JQS.

                     In this phase, the curriculum developer or team also develops the
                     objectives and test and designs instruction. The implementation
                     plan for the instructional system is also developed in this phase
                     and a training information management system is designed; for
                     example, building training records if required. Formative
                     evaluation activities continue in this phase.

                         Example: Develop a plan to train individuals to meet duty
                         position requirements they are not qualified on.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 11      1 November 2002                                        12



Development         In the development phase, both the student and instructor lesson
phase               materials are developed or selected. If the media selected in the
                    design phase included items such as videotapes, sound/slides,
                    interactive courseware (ICW), and training devices, these are
                    developed or acquired. If a training information management
                    system was developed for the instructional system, it is installed
                    in this phase (for example, a load in the Core Automated
                    Maintenance System (CAMS) or an addition to a training chart).
                    As a final step in this phase, the implementation plan is updated.

                    During this phase, you also validate each unit/module of
                    instruction and associated instructional materials as they are
                    developed. You correct any deficiencies that are identified.
                    Validation includes:

                        Internal review of the instruction and materials, such as a
                        training plan for accuracy.
                        Individual and small-group tryouts such as work center or one-
                        on-one training.
                        Operational tryouts for the entire system.

                    Revision of units/modules occurs as they are validated, based on
                    feedback from formative evaluation activities such as trainees'
                    Q&A or E&T Specialist. The final step of this phase is to finalize
                    all instructional materials.


Implementation      The instructional system has been designed and developed, and
phase               it is now time for the system to become operational. In this
                    phase, the instructional system training is accomplished under
                    operational conditions and the results of operational evaluation
                    provide feedback on the graduate's performance.


Evaluation          Evaluation is a continuous process beginning during the analysis
                    phase and continuing throughout the life cycle of the instructional
                    system. Evaluation consists of:

                        Formative Evaluation, consisting of process and product
                        evaluations conducted during the analysis and design phases,
                        and validation conducted during the development phase.
                        Included are individual and small-group tryouts.
AFH 36-2235     Volume 11       1 November 2002                                          13




Evaluation                  Example: Trainer/trainee feedback on a unit or block of
(Continued)                 training as it is being developed.

                       Summative Evaluation, consisting of operational tryouts
                       conducted as the last step of validation in the development
                       phase.

                            Example: Feedback from the trainer, trainees, or certifier
                            on a training course that is being conducted for the first
                            time as a complete training course.

                       Operational Evaluation, consisting of periodic internal and
                       external evaluation of the operational system during the
                       implementation phase. Each form of evaluation should be
                       used during development, update, and revision.

                            Example: A staff assistance visit is a form of operational
                            evaluation.

Updated Air Force   The QI process, further discussed in this chapter, is briefly
ISD model           described below.
(Continued)
                    Quality Improvement is the continuous, organized creation of
                    beneficial change to the system. The objective of quality
                    improvement is to foster continuous improvement in the process
                    and products of ISD through continuous evaluation and feedback,
                    which is always encouraged. It is an independent evaluation to
                    determine whether the products are meeting the users' needs.
                    The objective of quality improvement is to ensure on-time
                    development of high-quality courseware enabling trainees to
                    reach the desired performance levels in an effective and cost-
                    efficient manner.

                    The updated model graphically illustrates that:
                       Evaluation is the foundation of the ISD process.
                       ISD is a continuous process with the flexibility to enter and
                       reenter the various phases, as necessary, to develop, update,
                       or revise instruction.
                       All ISD activities take place within and are dependent on the
                       system functions.
                       Teamwork is required between personnel performing system
                       functions and those designing, developing, and implementing
                       instructional systems.
                       All ISD activities and system functions focus on continuous
                       quality improvements in the system through evaluation and
                       feedback.

What are system      System functions should be in place before implementing the
functions?           training system. The system functions are described below.

                              Function                        Purpose
                     Management              The practice of directing, controlling,
                                             coordinating, and monitoring all aspects of
                                             the training system. These functions are
                                             normally performed by commanders,
                                             supervisors, base/unit EST as well as
                                             others.
                     Support                 This provides for and maintains the training
                                             system on a day-to-day as well as a long-
                                             term basis. Examples are the resources
                                             needed to keep equipment functioning
                                             such as logistic and maintenance support.
                     Administration          The part of management that does day-to-
                                             day tasks. Includes tasks such as
                                             maintaining office supplies, scheduling,
                                             maintaining records, and squadron
                                             administrative duties.
                     Delivery                The means by which training is provided to
                                             the trainees. Instructors, computers,
                                             printed materials, audiovisual programs are
                                             all examples of ways training can be
                                             delivered. Another example is "hands-on"
                                             demonstration performance training
                                             conducted by a trainer.
                     Evaluation              The function of gathering feedback data
                                             through formative, summative, and
                                             operational evaluations to assess system
                                             and student performance.


When you             For the training system to be effective and cost-efficient, the
implement them       system functions should be "in place" and working before the
                     actual design, development, and implementation processes
                     begin. Normally, the system functions will already be "in place"
                     for you in the unit training environment.

                                     Analysis

What it is          Analysis is the process of:

                        Collecting information on job performance requirements of Air
                        Force missions, jobs, tasks, and duties.
                        Determining the necessary qualifications of the job
                        performers.

                    Initial skills interviews and duty position certification are examples
                    of the analysis performed at the unit level.


Why do it?          Analysis is conducted to ensure that the right training is designed
                    and developed for the identified tasks needing training.


Where to read       Details on the analysis phase of ISD are provided in Chapter 4.
about it            Seven topics are listed below.

                         G        Determine Training Requirements                 78


When you do it      Conduct analysis before beginning to design and develop a new
                    training system, updating or revising an existing system, or
                    starting OJT.


What you get        If the analysis has been properly conducted, valid training
                    requirements will be identified and normally an accurate
                    projection of required training resources can be made.

                                     Section C
                                      Design

What it is          Training design is like architectural design. You figure out what
                    you want the training to look like and how you want it to work
                    before you build it. The previously performed analysis will help
                    determine the basic structure of the training in the design phase.


Why do it?          You use training design to ensure training quality, save money,
                    and get needed training done on time. One does not just start
                    developing training, just as one does not start building a
                    classroom facility without analyzing the needs, and planning and
                    designing it first.


Where to read       Details on the design phase of ISD are provided in Chapter 5.
about it            Specific topics are listed below.

                      Section                     Topic                       Page

                         C       Determine Training Objectives                  87
                         D       Determine Evaluations and Criteria             91
                         E       Determine Training Sequence                    98
                         F       Determine Training Methods                    101

                         H       Define Resource Requirements                  106


When you do it      Training design begins after completing the necessary analysis
                    and before training development begins.
AFH 36-2235     Volume 11      1 November 2002                                          19



What you get       Proper design will result in:

                       Instructional objectives (what to teach).
                       Performance and knowledge tests that measure the objectives
                       (how well the trainee can do the job).
                       Methods, media, and necessary strategies to deliver the
                       training.
                       Training information management system (training
                       documentation), if applicable.
                       Review of existing instructional materials.


What you need      All of the products developed during initial planning and the
                   analysis phase are required to design an effective, cost-efficient
                   instructional system.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 11      1 November 2002                                         20



                                    Section D
                                   Development

What it is          During the ISD development phase training is developed,
                    validated, and revised, as appropriate. Training development
                    includes activities such as:

                        Writing (print; e.g., training guide)
                        Producing/procuring (video or audiovisual materials)
                        Installing (information management systems; e.g., training
                        documentation)
                        Building (training devices/simulators)
                        Validating (formative, summative, and operational evaluation)
                        training
                        Revising (training materials)


Why do it?          Training development activities are undertaken in order to have a
                    valid training program or product ready for the implementation
                    phase.


Where to read       Details on the development phase of ISD are provided in
about it            Chapter 6. Four topics are listed below.

                      Section                     Topic                       Page
                         A        Develop Training Guides                     112
                         B        Develop or Acquire Training Media           116
                         C        Finalize Training Schedule                  120
                         D        Validate Training Program                   122


When you do it      Development begins after the design is complete and before the
                    training is implemented (conducted).


What you get        Adequately developed training results in training products that
                    meet the design specifications and, more important, the users'
                    needs.
AFH 36-2235     Volume 11      1 November 2002                                 21



What you need      For the development phase, the following are needed:

                       Planning, analysis, and design documents and products
                       Students and equipment for validation
AFH 36-2235      Volume 11      1 November 2002                                          22



                                   Section E
                                 Implementation

What it is          In the implementation phase, the training system is implemented
                    and the training or course becomes operational and you start
                    conducting the training.


Why do it?          Training is implemented and conducted to meet the specified or
                    stated training needs of the users. For example, trainees are
                    upgraded when the training provided enables them to perform to
                    the standards specified in the training standard, thus meeting the
                    users' needs.


When you do it      The implementation phase of ISD is entered once the training has
                    been adequately validated and everyone agrees the training
                    meets the unit's training needs.


What you get        Successfully implemented training results in trainees who can
                    meet the established job performance requirements and
                    standards; that is, are certified to perform the required tasks.


What you need       To enter the implementation phase, the following are needed:

                        A finished training product such as training guides and visual
                        aids
                        All training system functions in place
AFH 36-2235      Volume 11       1 November 2002                                      23



                                      Section F
                                      Evaluation

What it is          Evaluation measures the quality, effectiveness, and cost-
                    efficiency of the training system. Evaluation answers the
                    questions:

                        Is the process effective and cost-efficient?
                        Are quality products being developed?
                        How well are the trainees performing on the job?
                        How can the system be improved?


Why do it?          Evaluation improves the quality of the ISD process and products
                    while producing trainees who can meet job performance
                    requirements and standards.


When you do it      Evaluation begins in the initial planning stages of the ISD process
                    and continues throughout the life cycle of the training system.


What you get        Evaluation provides data on the quality of the ISD process and
                    products and determines whether trainees are meeting job
                    performance requirements and standards.


What you need       To properly perform evaluation, the following are needed:

                        An operational training plan
                        Completed ISD activities
                        ISD products
                        An operational training system
                        Graduates of the training
                        An evaluator (e.g., task certifier)

                                    Section G
                               Quality Improvement

Introduction          ISD is a continuous, systematic process that incorporates a
                      never-ending evaluation process. The Air Force uses the ISD
                      process as a tool to ensure that quality training systems are
                      developed. It helps training managers and curriculum developers
                      plan, design, develop, and implement quality training programs to
                      train Air Force personnel in the most effective, cost-efficient
                      manner possible. The ISD process implements all of the
                      principles of the Quality Air Force (QAF) program. A process-
                      focused approach is a major way of achieving continuous,
                      measurable improvements in the quality of training. As a
                      structured approach is implemented for process improvements
                      the training design team will identify problems, analyze the
                      problems, and design and develop solutions to the problems in
                      order to improve the process. This section of the chapter covers
                      QI and explains total quality process improvement.


What it is            Quality improvement is the continuous, organized creation of
                      beneficial change to the training system. It is an independent
                      evaluation to determine whether the training is meeting the users'
                      and trainees' needs.


Objectives of QI      The objectives of quality improvement are to foster continuous
                      improvement in the processes and products and to ensure on-
                      time development of high-quality courseware or training that
                      enables trainees to reach the desired performance levels in an
                      effective and cost-efficient manner.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 11       1 November 2002                                         25



Results of QI        Quality-developed training products result in:

                         Increased trainee satisfaction.
                         Products that are easy to use and maintain.
                         Increased ability of trainees to perform on the job.

                     Quality-designed training results in:

                         Fewer errors.
                         Less rework (and waste).
                         Higher training success.
                         Less time spent in developing new or revising training
                         products.
                         Low life cycle costs.


ISD and quality      All of the principles of quality are implemented in the ISD
relationship         process. The ISD process ensures total quality in the training
                     environment by continuously evaluating the process and
                     products. The relationship between the key concepts of QI can
                     be easily seen in the ISD process. For example:

                     Customers:
                       The customer defines quality. ISD emphasizes criterion-
                       based training. The criteria are directly linked to performance
                       requirements. Field representatives (supervisors, squadron
                       commanders, etc.) identify training requirements, which
                       training providers such as Air Education and Training
                       Command (AETC) or other training organizations are then
                       under "contract" to satisfy. All evaluations are focused on the
                       trainee's actual job performance.

                         Know your customer. The information gained in the
                         mission/job analysis process gives you or the training design
                         team information that defines the customer's expectations.
                         Since ISD requires all training to be directly tied to job
                         requirements, the customer is the gaining unit or work center.
                         Everything is done on the premise that what the individual
                         needs to do the job determines the training requirements.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 11       1 November 2002                                          26




ISD and quality          Focus on customers. As mentioned earlier, the gaining unit or
relationship             work center needs to determine training requirements. By
(Continued)              continuing to trace the relationship between the job
                         requirements and the individual's needs to do the job, a
                         continual focus on the actual field requirement is maintained.
                         In addition, the ISD process requires that the capabilities,
                         aptitudes, and attitudes of the target audience be considered
                         during the design phase.

                     Team Players:
                       Foster teamwork. A training program cannot be designed
                       and developed in a vacuum. In order to develop effective,
                       cost-efficient training, the development team should be in
                       constant touch with the work center and evaluation offices to
                       ensure that the training matches the performance
                       requirements on the job.
                       Empower your people. ISD is a problem-solving, decision-
                       making model. Since ISD is flexible and since there are many
                       ways to solve a given training problem, a development team
                       should be allowed freedom and given authority to analyze,
                       design, develop, and implement training meeting job
                       performance requirements and standards.

                     Final Product:
                        Know your mission. ISD depends on mission and job analysis
                        for the necessary data to design, develop, and implement
                        training. All training must be based directly on mission or job
                        requirements. The quality checks in the analysis process help
                        eliminate training that is unnecessary or unrelated to the job.

                         Job analysis uses data from many sources, including mission
                         statements found in policy directives or locally developed
                         statements. Curriculum developers also make use of
                         management engineering reports, occupational survey data,
                         and direct observation to determine the actual job
                         requirements.

                         As part of the job analysis process, a training needs
                         assessment (TNA) is conducted to determine the actual
                         performance problems. In some cases, a problem is not due
                         to a lack of training, but to deficiencies within the job structure
AFH 36-2235       Volume 11      1 November 2002                                        27




ISD and quality          or training environment. The ISD process helps ensure that
relationship             training is not developed for non-training problems. Training
(Continued)              may also be developed as a "preventive" measure — that is,
                         to prevent potential problems and to meet the informational
                         and educational needs of Air Force personnel.
                         Set goals and standards. The goals and standards for the
                         training design and development effort come in many
                         variations. First, the job requirements and the impact of the
                         performance deficiency determine the timing required for the
                         design and development process and the conducting of the
                         training program. Second, the content of the training is
                         determined by the individual's need to do the job. You or the
                         development team must directly translate the cues, conditions,
                         and performance standards for the job directly into the training
                         program.
                         Manage by fact. Each phase of the ISD process requires
                         constant evaluation against the job requirements identified
                         earlier in the process. In addition, a variety of tools have been
                         developed to ensure that the design and development
                         decisions are made with supporting data. For example, a
                         number of media selection tools are being used to provide
                         training managers with information that matches the training
                         media with the training requirements. These matches are
                         based on learning theories and development cost factors
                         (money and time). ISD is designed to guide training
                         managers and curriculum developers to the awareness of
                         factors affecting their decisions.
                         Integrate quality in all phases. Evaluation is continuous
                         quality checking. This is true during each phase of the ISD
                         process, from analysis to evaluation. Built-in checks in each
                         phase ensure the quality of the ISD process and training
                         products with emphasis on the trainee's performance.
                         Evaluate quality constantly. The ISD process is a cyclic,
                         ongoing process of continuous improvements. As you
                         progress through the different phases of ISD, the processes
                         and products of each phase are constantly evaluated against
                         the training requirements and the principles of learning. The
                         results of the evaluations determine which phase of ISD to
                         enter next. Constant evaluation identifies changes in training
                         requirements due to updates in equipment and personnel,
                         resulting in new ISD efforts to provide the best possible
                         education and training for Air Force personnel.

Basis of process      The basis of process improvement is Quality Air Force (QAF).
improvement           QAF is a management philosophy and a methodology working
                      together to produce continuous process improvements. It is
                      based on ten principles.

                          All work is a process.
                          Processes receive work from suppliers, add value and deliver
                          output to customers.
                          Anyone from whom a process receives work is a supplier.
                          Anyone to whom a process delivers output is a customer.
                          Customers have needs and expectations.
                          Customers define and measure quality in terms of those
                          needs and expectations.
                          Quality is meeting customer needs and expectations.
                          Improving process quality increases productivity.
                          Processes can be identified, understood, measured, and
                          improved.
                          Individuals who operate the processes know best how to
                          improve them.


Procedures for        In order to ensure process improvements, you will need to use a
process               systematic method to identify and correct the causes of the
improvements          problems. The six steps of process improvements are outlined in
                      the table below, explaining the ISD process in simple terms.

                          Step             Activity
                           1        Define the process and determine the main problem
                                          areas.
                           2        Analyze the problems and identify the causes of
                                          each.
                           3        Identify and evaluate possible changes to the
                                            process.
                           4        Implement the changes and monitor the process.
                           5        Institutionalize the changes.
                           6        Repeat for continuous improvements.

Ways to implement        There are many different ways to implement the basic procedures
the procedures           mentioned above. Two of the most common ways are:

                             "Chart it, check it, change it."
                             Shewhart cycle (plan-do-check-act).

                         Each of these techniques uses the six basic steps mentioned
                         above.


Chart It, Check It,      "Chart it, check it, change it" is a systematic approach to
Change It                continuous improvement. It can be used to analyze any training
                         requirement or capability. It can also be used to determine if a
                         work center's training plan is working. This approach has three
                         principal steps that are shown in the table below and in Figure 4.

                                2             Analyze the data.
                              Check It        Evaluate the process.
                                              Identify opportunities.
                                 3            Improve the process.
                              Change It       Institutionalize the change.

                      improved.
                      Gather data on the process and
                      its products.

                    Check It

                      problems and opportunities.
                      Evaluate the process to identify
                      alternative approaches.
                      Identify opportunities (i.e.,
                      useful changes) from the
                      alternatives.                                 CHECK IT

                    Change It
                      Improve the process by
                      implementing changes
                      identified as opportunities.
                      Institutionalize the changes                  CHANGE IT
                      through training standard-
                      ization, etc. Then use another
                      process (or use this same one
                      again) to make further
                      improvements.


Shewhart cycle      The Shewhart cycle is a systematic approach to achieving
                    continuous improvement in quality. The cycle includes planning,
                    doing, checking, and acting. Because the approach involves
                    repetition, it is represented graphically as a circle in Figure 5.

                          Implement the planned
                          improvement effort. Train
                          the individuals who are
                          responsible for
                          implementation.
                          Check the results. Measure the results of the improvement
                          effort you implemented against the old procedures. Analyze
                          the data you collected.
                          Act on the results. If the effort was truly an improvement,
                          standardize and document it. If it was not successful,
                          determine what could be done to improve it, or where the
                          problem was.
                          Repeat. Continue around the cycle again by planning and
                          carrying out further activities.


Flowchart –           Many tools are used to make process improvements. One tool
A process             often used to analyze process problems is the flowchart. A
improvement tool      flowchart is a graphical representation of all the major steps of a
                      process such as an "overblown" task breakdown. It can help:

                          Understand the complete process.
                          Identify the critical stages of the process.
                          Locate problem areas.
                          Show relationships between different steps in a process.

How to use it        Flowchart steps are:

                        Identify the process. Define the start point and finish point for
                        the process to be examined.
                        Chart the ideal process. Try to identify the easiest and most
                        efficient way to go from the start block to the finish block.
                        While this step is not absolutely necessary, it does make it
                        easier to find improvements.
                        Describe the current process. Chart the whole process (i.e.,
                        lay out all the steps) from beginning to end. You can use
                        standard symbols to improve the clarity of the flowchart.
                        Search for improvement opportunities. Identify all areas that
                        hinder the process or add little or no value. Examine all areas
                        that differ from the ideal process and question why they exist.
                        Update the chart. Build a new flowchart to correct the
                        problems identified in the previous step.

Using process      As previously mentioned, there are numerous process
improvement        improvement tools that can be used to document and improve the
methods            training development process. Curriculum developers or
                   development teams are encouraged to use a process
                   improvement tool such as flowcharting for developing a new
                   process or revising an existing process. Also, if current training
                   development processes have not been documented using
                   process improvement tools, it should be done in order to improve
                   the process.

Metrics              Metrics are standards of measurement of quality indicators that
                     are critical to maintaining quality in the training development
                     process. The purpose of metrics is to provide qualitative and
                     quantitative evaluations of the process and products within each
                     phase of ISD. Metrics are based on key factors such as
                     performance, cost, and schedule. Types of metrics include, but
                     are not limited to, items such as:

                         Qualitative

metric process       develop and measure unit training or OJT. It can be modified to
                     meet unique and specific needs of the unit.

                                    Overview

Introduction       Effective, cost-efficient unit level training does not just
                   happen—it must be planned. Adequate planning is a key
                   element in the management of the overall training system as well
                   as the instructional system development (ISD) process itself.
                   Although not a part of the actual ISD process, adequate planning
                   should take place prior to starting the process.

                   It is the responsibility of unit-level managers, supervisors,
                   trainers, and instructional developers to do adequate planning
                   prior to designing, developing, implementing, and evaluating unit-
                   level training. To ensure that training courses and programs are
                   successful, all those in the unit who are involved in training
                   should do their part to ensure that adequate planning has taken
                   place before training design starts.

                                  Section A
                     Identify Roles and Responsibilities

Introduction         Determining the roles and responsibilities of individuals involved
                     in unit training programs is a key factor in preparing to apply the
                     ISD process to unit training. In this stage of planning, the roles
                     and responsibilities of individuals involved in the unit training
                     programs are identified. For example, the roles and
                     responsibilities of the commander, training managers,
                     supervisors, trainers, instructional developers, and trainees are
                     identified. For unit training programs to be effective and cost-
                     efficient, individuals involved in the training programs must
                     understand their roles and responsibilities so they can
                     successfully carry them out in support of a quality unit training
                     program.


Purpose              The purpose of determining the roles and responsibilities of
                     individuals involved in the planning, design, development,
                     implementation, evaluation, and management of unit training is to
                     ensure that individuals are aware of the tasks they are
                     responsible for and the role they play as members of the unit
                     training team.


Who is               If a team is used to develop unit training programs, the team is
responsible?         normally responsible for ensuring that each individual's role and
                     responsibilities are clearly defined. Existing Air Force policy
                     directives such as AFPD 36-22 also prescribe many of the roles
                     and responsibilities at the unit training level.


When are roles and   Determining the roles and responsibilities of the individuals
responsibilities     involved in the unit training process is one of the first stages, if
determined?          not the first, in the initial ISD planning for the unit training. This
                     task should be accomplished as early as possible to ensure that
                     individuals clearly understand their role and responsibilities as
                     members of the unit training team responsible for unit training
                     programs. Squadron Commanders can often help define the
                     roles, if you provided them with the appropriate information.
AFH 36-2235         Volume 11      1 November 2002                                          43



What is required?      In order to determine roles and responsibilities, several tasks
                       should be performed which include, but are not limited to, the
                       following:

                           Determine the scope and level of the unit training project.
                           Identify the unit training team members such as supervisors,
                           trainers, instructional developers, and subject matter experts
                           (SME).
                           Define the role and responsibility of each team member.

                       These tasks are further described in this section.


Scope and level of     The scope and level of the unit training projects will determine the
the project            individuals required to "work the project" to ensure that a cost-
                       efficient, quality training program is developed in a timely manner.
                       For example:

                           Developing a new unit training course or an on-the-job training
                           (OJT) program for a new defense system will normally require
                           more individuals with different skills than revising an existing
                           course or program.
                           Developing a new unit training course using multimedia will
                           require personnel using different skills than are required to
                           develop a structured on-the-job training (SOJT) handbook.
                           Levels of complexity within interactive courseware (ICW) will
                           impact the number of skills required to develop a training
                           program.
                           Some members will be in the squadron; with additional
                           outside help being required as the complexity of the project
                           increases.

                       Early in the planning stages, the exact scope and level required
                       to develop a unit training program may be clearly definable.
                       However, in the later phase of the ISD process, the scope and
                       level of the training project will be defined, allowing the personnel
                       required to be actively involved in the project to be identified.
AFH 36-2235        Volume 11      1 November 2002                                             44




Identifying unit      Once the scope and level of the project have been defined, the
training team         individuals needed to plan, design, develop, implement, evaluate,
members               and manage the training can be identified.

                      When identifying individuals, remember to identify team members
                      such as:

                          Managers for the unit training program being developed or
                          revised.
                          Supervisors who will supervise the training program once it is
                          developed.
                          Trainers who will conduct the training.
                          Instructional developers who will develop the training program.
                          Subject matter experts (SME) to provide technical content.
                          Evaluators who will evaluate the training.

                      Identification of the team members should be done as soon as
                      possible to ensure there is sufficient time for the team to develop
                      a quality training program that meets the users' needs in a timely
                      manner.


Defining roles and    Once the team members have been identified, their role and
responsibilities      responsibilities for the specific unit training project should be
                      clearly defined. Clearly defined roles and responsibilities will:

                          Allow individuals to know their roles as members of the unit
                          training team.
                          Identify who is responsible for performing each task in the ISD
                          process.

                      It should be noted that it may not be possible to identify all of the
                      responsibilities for each individual team member until after the
                      training design has been completed.

                                   Section B
                     Receive Training Development Tasking

Introduction          A tasking may be received from the unit commander to develop a
                      new course for handling toxic waste or a new on-the-job training
                      (OJT) program to provide training on a new ground power unit.
                      Taskings such as these, as well as others, are normally the
                      source or starting point for developing or revising training courses
                      or programs. This section will discuss some of the tasking that
                      may result in unit training development efforts.


What is tasking?      Tasking is any formal request to develop or revise unit training
                      courses or OJT programs.


Who issues            Tasking to develop training may come from a number of different
tasking?              organizations or levels within the organization. Formal tasking
                      will normally flow through predetermined channels depending on
                      the level and source of its origin.

                      The following are examples of different levels from which tasking
                      may be issued:
                        Functional Managers – Air Staff (HQ USAF)
                        Functional Managers – Major Command (MAJCOM)
                        Group Commanders – Base
                        Unit Commanders – Base


Sources of tasking    Tasking to develop training may come from any number of
                      sources. Examples are:

                      External
                         Air Force Policy Directives
                         Utilization and Training Workshops (U&TW)

Who is             The unit training development team has the responsibility for:
responsible?
                       Planning for adequate unit training courses and on-the-job
                       training programs.
                       Designing, developing, implementing, and evaluating the
                       training.
                       Ensuring the quality of the ISD process and the products of
                       each of the processes within the ISD process.
                       Responding to the user's needs.


Training need      Remember, the ISD process starts with a training need. It
                   normally comes to the training team in the form of a formal
                   request to develop or revise unit training courses or OJT
                   programs.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 11      1 November 2002                                         47



                                  Section C
               Determine Training Needed To Meet Requirements

Introduction         At this point in the ISD planning process, training needed to meet
                     the user's requirements should be determined. Early in the
                     planning stages, adequate preparations will help ensure that
                     training is designed and developed to meet the unit's established
                     training requirements.


Purpose              The purpose for determining the training needed to meet the
                     requirements of the training system is to identify the types of
                     training required, such as new performance skills, knowledge,
                     and attitudes to maintain and support a new defense system.
                     Early identification of needed training will enable the training
                     development team to more accurately design, develop, and
                     implement training systems based on the effect training will have
                     on training system components such as equipment, facilities,
                     time, personnel, media, and methods.


Who is               The unit training development team is responsible for determining
responsible?         the training needed to meet the user's training requirements and
                     the system requirements.


When should it be    Determining the needed training to meet the system training
done?                requirements should be done early during the initial planning
                     stages of the instructional system development (ISD) project.
                     The training requirements should be determined prior to making
                     preliminary decisions such as the media and methods that should
                     be used and the possible training alternatives.
AFH 36-2235        Volume 11      1 November 2002                                         48



How should it be      During the initial planning for the ISD project, it may not be
done?                 possible to identify all of the training needed to field a training
                      system. For example, as a new or revised training system begins
                      to take shape the training requirements will be more easily
                      identified. The same is true when new policy directives require
                      new unit training courses. Often the courses and their content
                      cannot be determined until more is known about the directive and
                      any additional guidance that might be provided by subordinate
                      units.

                      There are several ways to initially identify the training that may be
                      needed to meet the user's training requirements. Some of the
                      methods are:

                          Compare the on-the-job training (OJT) programs developed
                          for one defense system or an Air Force Specialty (AFS) to see
                          if any of the lessons learned, methods, media, materials, or
                          content can be used in the training to be designed and
                          developed.
                          Review existing DoD and Air Force sources such as catalogs
                          to determine if training already exists that could be used or
                          revised to meet the training requirements.
                          Check DoD and Air Force directives to determine if they
                          require specific training to a specified level to meet the
                          requirements.
                          Use the experience of the unit training team members to
                          identify possible training requirements and to improve the
                          training development process and the quality of the products.

                               Section D
                Determine Training System Requirements

Introduction        Prior to applying the ISD process to developing unit training or
                    OJT, some initial planning will need to be done to set the stage
                    for the development process. Part of the initial planning is to
                    determine the new or revised training requirements of the unit.
                    Since the requirements identified in the planning stage are
                    preliminary, they may need to be revised or updated as unit
                    training requirements change, defense systems are fielded, and
                    new OJT requirements are established. Determining the training
                    system requirements within a unit is a continuous process since
                    requirements are always changing and existing training courses
                    and programs need to be constantly improved.


Purpose             The purpose of identifying the requirements for unit training and
                    OJT is to establish a "framework" for building an effective, cost-
                    efficient unit training system.

                    responsibility of the unit training development team tasked with
                    the responsibility for designing and developing the training.

                    system, new computer equipment, or new policies and
                    procedures will require a determination of the new or revised
                    training requirements, how they fit in the overall training system,
                    and their impact on current training programs.

What should be      Determining the training system requirements within the unit
determined?         includes:

                        Assessing technology and methodology. This includes
                        looking at the technology that is available in the unit or can be
                        obtained within the unit. It also includes a look at new
                        methodology or procedures in order to determine how they
                        might be used to meet training requirements within the unit.

                        Making preliminary methods and media selection. The
                        preliminary selection of methods and media is the "best
                        guess" as to what may be the best way to provide the training
                        such as ICW, job aids, classroom lecture, SOJT guides, etc.
                        Making the preliminary decisions allows further planning and
                        design activities to be processed, such as determining
                        possible training alternatives.

                        Examining training alternatives. This includes looking at the
                        anticipated training system requirements within the unit and
                        selecting alternative methods of providing the training in the
                        event the primary training delivery system is not available.
                        For example, the primary equipment for training a particular
                        OJT task may be a part-task trainer. However, the alternative
                        equipment for training that task is the actual aircraft.

                                    Section E
                        Identify Resource Requirements

Introduction         One of the most critical elements in unit training is resources.
                     Throughout the entire instructional system development (ISD)
                     process, resources will be a major concern. Each individual who
                     plays an active role in unit training has a responsibility for
                     resources. In the planning stages for the ISD process,
                     identification of the needed resources must begin. Resources
                     are required to plan, design, develop, implement, evaluate, and
                     manage unit training courses and OJT programs.


What is a            Resources in this handbook refers to:
resource?
                         Equipment – training, support, spare.
                         Facilities – classrooms, phase dock, laboratory, test stations.
                         Human Resources – instructional developers, trainers,
                         students.
                         Money – equipment, facilities and personnel cost.
                         Time – training development, personnel, training equipment.


Who has initial      Although each individual involved in unit training has a resource
responsibility?      responsibility, commanders and managers have the initial
                     responsibility. During the planning stages of developing or
                     revising unit training courses or OJT programs, they have the
                     overall responsibility for ensuring that the types and amounts of
                     resources are identified and are available to support the training
                     requirements.

                     When identifying resources required to support training, consider
                     the following questions:

                             Sample Questions for Identifying Resources
                     Equipment
                       What and how much training equipment is needed?
                       What and how much support equipment will be needed?
                       What and how many spares will be needed?
                       Are there any equipment constraints? If so, what are they?
AFH 36-2235        Volume 11      1 November 2002                                           52




Who has initial       Facilities
responsibility?          What type of facilities will be needed to conduct or support
(Continued)              training?
                         Will new facilities such as a classroom be required?
                         If existing facilities are used, will they require modification?
                         Are there any facility constraints? If so, what are they?

                      Human Resources
                        How many instructional developers will be needed?
                        How many trainers will be needed?
                        Will subject matter experts be required?
                        Will task certifiers be required?
                        How many students will need to be trained each year?
                        Are there any personnel constraints? If so, what are they?

                      Funds
                        How much will it cost to design, develop, and implement
                        training?
                        How much will it cost to support, operate, and maintain the
                        training?
                        Are any funds specifically marked for training?
                        Are there any funding constraints? If so, what are they?

                      Time
                         Are the identified training requirements current?
                         How long will it take to design and develop the training?
                         How long will the training course be?
                         Do students have sufficient time to attend the training?
                         How soon must trainees be proficient?
                         Are there any time constraints?



Revising initial      During the planning stage, it may not be possible for the training
requirements          development team to identify all of the resources needed to
                      develop or revise a unit training course or OJT program.
                      However, later in the design and development phase of the
                      process the team will be able to more clearly identify the type and
                      amount of resources needed for an effective, quality training
                      course or program.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 11      1 November 2002                                       53



Sources of           In order for the unit training development team to identify the
identifying          required resources, many sources of information will have to be
resources            used. Some of the sources that can be used to identify the
                     needed resources are:

                     Documentation
                       Unit manning documents.
                       Training standards.
                       Master task list (MTL).
                       Policy directives.
                       Technical data.
                       Mission statements.
                       Unit training requirements.
                       Existing courses and programs.

                     Personnel and Equipment
                        Subject matter experts (SME).
                        System requirements.
                        System specifications.
                        Operating instructions.
                        Similar systems.


Availability of      Resource availability is critical to the design, development,
resources            implementation, evaluation, and management of effective, quality
                     unit training courses and OJT programs. Adequate resources
                     must be available when they are needed.

                     Early identification of needed resources helps ensure that the
                     resource is available when needed.

                     For example, some training may require:

                         More than two years to get a part-task trainer to train a
                         specific task.
                         One year or more to get an instructional developer or
                         computer programmer.
                         Three or more years to have a facility built.
                         Four or five years for the budget process.

How to deal with      Those involved in unit training and OJT will likely always be faced
resource              with some type of resource constraint. Seldom will all of the
constraints           needed resources be available. The table below suggests some
                      alternatives for working around resource constraints.

                            Resource Constraints and Possible Alternatives
                      Equipment
                        Borrow equipment from another unit or squadron.
                        Share equipment with other units or squadrons.
                        Build part-task trainers rather than using the actual equipment.
                        Use the equipment on more than one shift.
                        Use larger group sizes on the equipment.
                        Use other delivery methods and media to overcome
                        equipment problems.

                      Facilities
                         Use temporary facilities.
                         Operate multiple shifts.
                         Share facilities with other units or squadrons.
                         Use different delivery methods and media.

                      Human Resources
                        Use trainers from other units and squadrons.
                        Borrow instructional developers from other units and
                        squadrons.
                        Increase student group size.
                        Reduce training time.
                        Use different delivery methods and media.

                      Funds
                        Use desktop simulators rather than full simulators.
                        Increase the number of students taught at one time.
                        Borrow equipment and facilities rather than buying or building.
                        Select less expensive delivery methods and media.

                      Time
                         Use additional personnel to design and develop the training.
                         Design and implement a shorter version of the training.
                         Use different delivery methods and media.
                         Work overtime.

                               Develop Evaluation Plan

Introduction          Instructional system development (ISD) is a total quality process,
                      which ensures that training courses and programs developed
                      using the process are both effective and cost-efficient and
                      produce students who have the skills, knowledge, and attitudes
                      needed to perform their jobs in the operational environment. To
                      ensure quality, evaluation of the processes and products must
                      begin in the planning stages of the ISD project and continue
                      throughout the life cycle of the unit training course or OJT
                      program.


Purpose of the        The purpose of the evaluation plan is to provide an organized,
plan                  structured plan for evaluating the ISD process and products to
                      ensure that quality unit training courses and OJT programs are
                      designed, developed, and implemented at the unit level.


Why have a plan?      An evaluation plan is a guide for establishing "what" and "how"
                      unit training courses and OJT programs will be evaluated during
                      the design and development process as well as for the life cycle
                      of the training to ensure total quality.


Who is                Management at the unit level has the overall responsibility for
responsible?          ensuring that a plan is developed for evaluating training.
                      However, the task of developing a plan is normally done by the
                      unit training development team.


When is a plan        The training development team should consider developing an
needed?               evaluation plan when new courses or OJT programs are
                      developed or major revisions are to be made to existing courses
                      or programs. However, the team will have to decide when it is
                      appropriate to develop an evaluation plan. It should be noted that
                      existing evaluation plans may be used with little or no
                      modification.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 11       1 November 2002                                          57



Format of the plan    The format of evaluation plans will be determined by the unit
                      responsible for developing and managing the training, unless the
                      MAJCOM has specific requirements. The content of the
                      evaluation plan is flexible and will depend to a great degree on
                      the nature and scope of the training being developed or revised.
                      In all cases the plan should contain no more nor less information
                      than is necessary to document how the training development
                      process and products will be evaluated. The plan should cover
                      all phases of the evaluation process including:

                         Formative evaluation.
                         Summative evaluation.
                         Operational evaluation.

                      Remember, the evaluation plan can be as simple as a one-page
                      document, if that is all that is needed to describe the evaluation
                      process for training being developed or revised.


What is in the plan   The evaluation plan should include information sufficient to
                      ensure that the ISD process results in total quality in both process
                      and products. The plan may include, but not be limited to, the
                      following information:

                         Purpose and scope of the evaluation.
                         Identification of responsibilities.
                         Identification of tasks involved in the evaluation process.
                         How and when the evaluation activities are to be
                         accomplished.
                         Documentation and report requirements.

                      The unit may establish requirements to include other information
                      in the evaluation plan as deemed appropriate for the specific
                      training development project.

                                       ANALYSIS
                                         Overview

Introduction          The analysis process provides the information needed to design,
                      develop, and implement effective, cost-efficient training
                      programs, which meet individual as well as work center needs.
                      The basic concept is to determine the task requirements of the
                      work center, and match those requirements against the skills and
                      knowledge of the individuals assigned to the work center.

                             Define Work Center Mission

Introduction        You know your job. You have been doing it a long time and you
                    are one of the best at it—otherwise you would not be the
                    supervisor. However, take a step back for a moment and rethink
                    your mission—your purpose, products, and customers.


What to define      The three parts of the work center mission that should be defined
                    during the analysis phase are listed in the table below.

                    Mission                Defining Questions
                          Part
                    Purpose            Why does the work center exist?
                                       How does the work center fit into the
                                       organization?
                                       What are the work center's responsibilities?
                    Products           What does the work center produce?
                                       What services does the work center provide?
                    Customers          What are the benefits of the work center's
                                       activities?
                                       Who uses the work center's products or
                                       services?
                                       What does the customer do with the work
                                       center's products or services?


How to use it       Questions such as these will help define the work center's
                    mission. Once the work center's mission has been defined, the
                    work to be accomplished in the work center can be identified and
                    verified. By assessing what should be going on in the work
                    center and comparing it to what is actually going on, supervisors
                    or the development team can determine what and when training
                    is needed. Providing the appropriate training at the right time to
                    the work force helps ensure mission accomplishment.

                                     Section B
                            Identify Work Center Tasks

Introduction       Work center tasks form the basis for all required unit training. It is
                   important that curriculum developers or the development team
                   not only identify the tasks actually being performed in the work
                   center but also the tasks to be performed. This form of mission
                   analysis is most often referred to as training needs assessment
                   (TNA). The difference between "what should be" and "what
                   actually is" determines what should be trained. Once it has been
                   determined what should be trained, the work center tasks can be
                   identified.


Sources of         There are many sources of information that can be used to
information        identify work center tasks. Some of the most commonly used
                   sources are:

                       Existing documents.
                       Interviews.
                       Questionnaires.

                   It is unlikely that one single source of information will always be
                   better than another source. The scope and nature of the work
                   center, operational environment, and the tasks involved will
                   normally determine the source to use in identifying work center
                   tasks. It is more likely that information from several sources will
                   provide for better work center task identification.

                                    Existing Documents

Introduction            There are many documents that will aid in identifying the tasks
                        required to be performed in a work center. The information
                        provided below provides an overview of some of these
                        documents. Other documents may be used depending on their
                        availability and suitability for identifying tasks in a specific work
                        center.


Specialty training      The Specialty Training Standard (STS) lists those tasks
standard                applicable to an entire Air Force Specialty. It specifies what is
                        taught in the resident technical schools and career development
                        courses (CDC), and to what level of performance. However,
                        training on the job is often more specific and extensive. The STS
                        should be analyzed and those areas or tasks performed in the
                        work center should be identified. It is not likely that all tasks listed
                        in the STS will be performed by any one given work center.


Career field            When researching specialties that have a Career Field Education
education and           and Training Plan (CFETP), ensure that the document is
training plan           reviewed carefully. The first section of the document lists the
                        education and training plan requirements for the specialty and
                        specifies the points in an individual's career at which the
                        education and training should be provided. The second section
                        contains the STS. The core tasks for the specialty and the job
                        types are identified in the CFETP. Also, in some plans the
                        minimum upgrade requirements may be identified. As CFETPs
                        are developed for each Air Force Specialty, training managers
                        and supervisors will be required to do less analysis at the unit
                        level since the plans will identify the unit training requirements.

                        NOTE: If a CFETP is available, it must be used.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 11      1 November 2002                                       64



Air Force job        An Air Force Job Qualification Standard (AFJQS) is a
qualification        comprehensive task list prepared by Air Force career field
standards            managers for a particular job type, duty position, or defense
                     system. There may be several AFJQSs for a given Air Force
                     Specialty. The tasks listed in an AFJQS are common to all
                     individuals working in a particular duty position. The AFJQS
                     helps standardize upgrade and qualification training because it
                     identifies the minimum tasks individuals must be qualified to
                     perform. A listing of the available AFJQSs can be found in
                     AFIND 8.

                     NOTE: An AFJQS will be included as part of the CFETP. It must
                     be used in lieu of the STS for individuals assigned to the specific
                     duty position or piece of equipment for which the AFJQS was
                     developed.


Command job          The Command Job Qualification Standard (CJQS) was
qualification        developed to list tasks specific to a Major Air Command
standards            (MAJCOM) job type, duty position, or defense system. Each
                     command has different procedures for developing CJQSs; some
                     may be organized by duty positions, and some may be organized
                     similar to the STS. CJQSs often include command-specific
                     upgrade requirements for both 5-skill level and 7-skill level. Many
                     also identify "critical tasks." The CJQS is used in conjunction
                     with an STS or AFJQS unless it has been approved as a "stand-
                     alone" document by the Air Force career field manager.


Other documents      Several other documents can also be reviewed by the
                     development team in order to identify the tasks to be performed
                     in the work center. These include documents such as policy
                     directives, manuals, handbooks, and technical orders. The
                     development team can also use military and civilian position
                     descriptions and base operation plans. Remember to look for
                     tasks that may be out of the ordinary or tasks not often
                     performed.

                                        Interviews

Introduction          Training managers or new supervisors may not have detailed
                      information about the work center. One of the best sources of
                      information regarding a work center or duty position is the subject
                      matter experts (SMEs), such as maintenance supervisors and
                      section/branch chiefs. An SME is someone who has field
                      expertise and recent job experience, and is familiar with the
                      training systems being used for the job or duty. Interviewing
                      SMEs is an excellent method to identify work center tasks.


Selecting SMEs        SME selection ultimately depends on the information required.
                      Contact supervisors and other knowledgeable individuals in the
                      work center. Next, determine approximately how many SMEs to
                      interview. The more SMEs interviewed, the more comprehensive
                      and valid the analysis will be. Also, the number of different Air
                      Force Specialties in a work center will affect how many experts
                      will need to be interviewed.


What to look for      Look for tasks currently being performed in the work center and
                      those that should be performed but are not yet identified. Search
                      for any special, recurring, wartime, or local tasks.

                      Ask about the details of the tasks. Details to look for include:

                          Equipment needed.
                          Tools needed.
                          Mission priority.
                          How critical the task is?
                          How many people perform the task?
                          How often the task is performed?

                          go level).

                      Another area the development team may want to focus on is how
                      the tasks can be broken down into duty positions within the work
                      center. The organization of the specialty or work center may lead
                      to different job types and/or functional groupings of tasks.

Interview        Some general guidelines for conducting an interview are:
guidelines
                     Have any research material available for reference during the
                     interview.
                     Ensure that questions pertain to a particular task. This will
                     help focus the SMEs on the tasks and prevent confusion.
                     Consider providing SMEs with a list of the task questions so
                     they can prepare for the interview.
                     Communicate at a level that promotes understanding and
                     mutual respect.
                     Speak clearly, distinctly, and with enough force to be heard
                     and understood.
                     When sitting in a chair, sit upright; don't slouch down in the
                     chair. Slouching conveys an "I don't care" attitude and the
                     interviewees may believe their time is being wasted.
                     Look at the individuals when asking questions.
                     After asking the question, listen to the response. Don't
                     interrupt.
                     Conclude the interview at the agreed time and thank the SME
                     for the input given. If the interview has not concluded, find out
                     when the individual will be available to finish.
AFH 36-2235         Volume 11      1 November 2002                                         68



                                      Questionnaires

Introduction           Another way to gather information on work center tasks is with a
                       questionnaire. This may help determine the details about the task
                       and can prove useful when trying to reach large numbers of
                       SMEs. There is no set format for a questionnaire. The questions
                       asked are determined by the information needed. If a
                       questionnaire exists that meets your needs, it may be used.
                       Questionnaires contain three sections: instructions, background
                       information sheet, and questions. Each of these is discussed
                       below.


Instructions           Respondents cannot effectively complete a questionnaire unless
                       they understand what is required of them. Therefore, instructions
                       need to be clear and concise, and identify what should be done to
                       complete the questionnaire. Also, the instructions should explain
                       the reasons for the questionnaire and how the respondent's
                       information will be used.


Background             The background information sheet helps determine who does
information sheet      what in the work center. When determining the different duty
                       position tasks, ask what duty position the respondent occupies.
                       Also, find out information such as the skill level of the respondent,
                       how long they have been in the AFS, and job title. Do not ask for
                       personal information.
AFH 36-2235   Volume 11      1 November 2002                                         69



Questions        In order to obtain the necessary information about work center
                 tasks, the right questions should be asked and the right format
                 should be used. The two basic types of questions normally used
                 in a questionnaire are closed-end and open-end. Many
                 questionnaires will use a combination of these two types of
                 questions to confirm the tasks already identified by duty position
                 or tasks missed during the initial research process. Additional
                 information on the two types of questions normally used on
                 questionnaires is provided below.

                 Closed-end Questions

                 Use closed-end questions when knowledge of the basic tasks
                 performed in a work center exists, but not a duty position.
                 Closed-end questions give the respondent a small number of
                 choices to make, such as answering "yes" or "no" to a question,
                 or selecting "a," "b," or "c" as the answer.

                 Open-end Questions

                 Use open-end questions if it is uncertain as to whether all work
                 center tasks have been identified. This type of question allows
                 the respondent to write in their own information about what tasks
                 they do on the job.
AFH 36-2235        Volume 11      1 November 2002                                       70



                                 Section C
                      Develop/Update Master Task Listing

Introduction          At this point, the development team should select those tasks
                      actually performed in the work center. The development team
                      should remember that most of the existing task listings are written
                      at a fairly global level. Thus, a determination must be made as to
                      which tasks in the listing apply to the specific mission and work
                      center. The listing of work center tasks is called a Master Task
                      Listing (MTL).


Advantages of an      There are several advantages to developing an MTL. Some of
MTL                   the advantages are:

                          All work center task requirements are listed in one place.
                          The requirements do not have to be memorized.
                          Program continuity is aided by allowing others to know what
                          the work center requirements are.
                          The MTL can be broken down to show what tasks and skill
                          levels are required for specific duty positions.


Documenting an        There are several methods used to document an MTL for the
MTL                   work center. Examples of some of the more popular ones are
                      given below. To be effective and useful, an MTL should be easy
                      to use. The key is to keep it simple.

                      NOTE: MAJCOM career field managers or base training
                      managers may have specific procedures for developing an MTL.


Example 1:            An MTL can be created by circling tasks in an STS or CJQS.
Tailored STS


Example 2:            Use a CFETP for identifying all core tasks and work center tasks.

Example 3:            Since an AFJQS is organized by duty position, it is easier to
Tailored AFJQS        cross off items that do not apply to the work center.

Example 4:          A quick reference-training chart can be made from an MTL by

                    onto a training chart.

                                   Section D
                        Define Work Center Duty Position

Introduction          The next activity in the unit training analysis process is to define
                      the duty positions within the work center. The duty positions,
                      together with the work center tasks, form the basis for defining
                      the specific training requirements.


Guideline             The development team needs to ensure that 100 percent of the
                      mission requirements are covered. One hundred percent
                      coverage means enough people will be assigned tasks as part of
                      their duty position to meet mission and customer requirements.
                      One hundred percent coverage does not mean every person in
                      the work center must be trained and qualified to perform every
                      work center task. For example, the tasks performed by all
                      individuals assigned to the work center should cover all of the
                      work center tasks. This includes critical tasks, high volume tasks,
                      and needed backup coverage.


Exception             One hundred percent task coverage does not mean every person
                      in the work center must be trained and qualified to perform every
                      work center task.


Determining duty      The steps required to determine duty positions within a work
positions             center are fairly straightforward.

                         Step             Action
                          1        Review the Master Task List (MTL).
                          2        Eliminate tasks that will be performed by all
                                   personnel.

                                   Note: These tasks become part of all duty positions.
                           3       Group remaining tasks by any or all of the following:

                                       Function.
                                       AFSC requirements.
                                       Job type.
                                       Skill level requirements.

Documenting duty   If an MTL is used to document work center tasks, it can also be
positions                 used to identify duty positions within the work center.
                          Annotate the MTL to show the breakdown of the duty
                          positions by task. This can be done with symbols,
                          numbers, or highlighter on any type of task list. Also, a
                          separate list can be made by duty position, or mark a JQS
                          for each duty position. It may be best to develop a
                          separate MTL for each duty position.

                                     Section E
                         Perform Initial Skills Evaluations

Introduction           Once all the work center tasks have been identified, the
                       development team can begin to define the specific training
                       requirements. In its simplest form, training requirements are the
                       tasks that individual members of the work center cannot perform.
                       Initial skills evaluations help identify which tasks the members
                       can and cannot perform. Initial evaluations are normally
                       conducted on newly assigned personnel or new trainees.


Evaluating new         Evaluate formal school graduates to determine the effectiveness
personnel              of the training they received. Remember, the graduate was not
                       trained to the "Go/No Go" standard. Expecting the trainee to
                       perform to the local qualification standard (Go/No Go) will not
                       provide a true picture of what the trainee has learned in the
                       formal school. For example, the performance standards taught in
                       the school may not meet the performance standards of the unit.


Evaluation criteria:   To evaluate new personnel, use the appropriate STS and base
New personnel          the assessment on the proficiency codes listed in the 3-skill level
                       column. Determining the effectiveness of training will help define
                       what training is needed so the graduate can perform to the
                       established standards.


Evaluating             Generally, individuals who transfer into a work center from
experienced            another base or work center have some experience in the AFS,
personnel              and a skill level commensurate with the grade. Start by reviewing
                       the member's training record to determine what training they have
                       received or what tasks the individual is qualified to do. To
                       determine actual performance level, observe the individual doing
                       the tasks. Also, a series of questions can be asked, usually
                       during the initial interview, which starts the process, to help
                       determine task knowledge, background, and other related
                       knowledge.
AFH 36-2235        Volume 11       1 November 2002                                           75



Evaluation criteria:   Conduct the evaluations using both the work center task
Experienced            standards and procedures. Often it will be determined that the
personnel              individual's performance simply does not meet the established
                       standards for the task. It may be that the procedures and
                       standards are different between the new work center and the
                       previous work center.


Using evaluation       The skills evaluations performed provide the information needed
results                to complete the next two phases of the training requirements
                       definition process. The list of skills that members of the work
                       center can and cannot perform is critical to determining which
                       duty positions will be filled by management. This list, together
                       with the list of duty position requirements, defines the individual
                       training requirements.

                                    Section F
                             Determine Duty Positions

Introduction          Which duty position management fills is a balancing act between
                      the needs and capabilities of the workers and the requirements of
                      the work center.


Factors to consider   Key considerations in placing individuals into specific duty
                      positions include:

                         Mandatory upgrade requirements.
                         Mandatory qualification requirements.
                         Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) training
                         requirements.
                         Existing or projected manpower constraints.
                         Number and types of personnel assigned to the work center.
                         Projected personnel gains and losses.
                         Job rotation requirements or capabilities.
                         Whether the work force is challenged.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 11       1 November 2002                                           77



                                    Section G
                          Define Training Requirements

Introduction          Once it has been decided what an individual will do (determined
                      by the duty position), it becomes a matter of comparing their skills
                      to the job requirements to determine what training is needed.
                      Based on the skills evaluations, if an individual is qualified on a
                      task, no further action is required. If not qualified and certified,
                      decertify the individual on those tasks (if appropriate) and enter
                      them into the appropriate qualification training. If tasks are
                      required but the individual is not certified, qualification training
                      should be started.


Individual training   The tasks identified as requiring training for a given member of
requirements          the work center become the individual training requirements. To
                      help keep track of these training requirements, document the
                      appropriate training standard for use as a Job Qualification
                      Standard (JQS). Refer to AFI 36-2201 and the cover page of the
                      training standard for documentation procedures.


Work center           In contrast to individual training requirements, work center
training              training requirements are the sum total of all of the work center's
requirements          training needs. The development team should make note of
                      recurring training and training needed by all or most of the
                      individuals in the work center (common requirements) for future
                      reference. Chapter 3 provides information on satisfying those
                      common training requirements.

Introduction          Once the analysis phase of the Instructional System
                      Development (ISD) process has been completed and the
                      necessary analysis data has been collected, the training
                      development team begins the design phase of the process. In
                      the design phase the framework for the training system is built by
                      determining the training objectives and designing the training. A
                      major concern for the developers is the effectiveness and cost-
                      efficiency of training design since it has a significant impact on
                      the next phase of the ISD process, which is development. In this
                      phase, as well as the other phases of the process, developers
                      are also concerned about the quality of the design process and
                      product.


Where are you in      At this point in the ISD process, the developers are ready to enter
the process?          the design phase. An ISD model with the design phase
                      highlighted is provided in Figure 10 to help visualize the entire
                      ISD process before beginning this phase.

                                Section A
                     Expand and Update Task Analysis

Introduction       When the unit training requirements have been identified in the
                   analysis process, the development team moves to the next phase
                   of the ISD process, which is design. In this phase, the first
                   activity is normally to expand and update the task analysis data.
                   This section provides additional information on this activity.


Reasons for        There are two basic reasons for expanding and updating the task
expanding and      analysis data. The reasons are:
updating
                       To make sure that all steps of the task have been identified.
                       To ensure that trainees are taught complete tasks.

                   Without a complete task breakdown, it is possible the trainers
                   may miss some portion of a procedure because the task has
                   become second nature to them. If omitted, it is unlikely the
                   trainee will be able to complete the task satisfactorily.

                   At this point, if sufficient data was not gathered during the
                   analysis phase, the development team should reenter the
                   analysis process and follow the prescribed procedures for
                   collecting additional data as necessary.
AFH 36-2235         Volume 11      1 November 2002                                        81



Expanding and          When researching the task analysis data, identify the following in
updating analysis      the order they occur:
data
                           Steps (subtasks)
                           Procedural skills
                           Supporting knowledge (for each task)

                       Figure 11 graphically illustrates the relationship between the
                       components of a task.

                                                           Tasks




                                                         Subtasks




                                     Procedural Skills              Task Knowledge




                       Data gathered at this point will be used to develop the objectives,
                       evaluations and lesson plans. The recommended procedures for
                       expanding and updating (breaking down) analysis data are:

                       Identify Subtasks

                           For each task, identify the steps (subtasks) required to
                           perform each task. These steps serve as the basis for much
                           of the later design activities. For example, identifying the
                           subtasks enables the development team to focus on
                           evaluation requirements and they can be used in the training
                           program as major teaching steps.

                       Identify Procedural Skills

                           Procedural skills are actions required to perform a subtask
                           such as reading a technical order (TO) or using tools or test
                           equipment. There may be procedural skills needed to perform
                           each subtask, or specific procedural skills required to perform
                           several subtasks. Each task will vary in the breakdown of
                           subtasks and related procedural skills.
AFH 36-2235         Volume 11      1 November 2002                                       82




Expanding and          Identify Task Knowledge
updating analysis
data (Continued)       This is the knowledge required to perform a subtask or
                       procedural skill such as choosing the right TO, knowing which
                       tool to use or how to operate test equipment. Critical knowledge,
                       such as safety procedures, will need to be included in the training
                       program.


Documenting task       There are numerous ways to document the task information. The
analysis               information may be documented or recorded by using a
                       worksheet or form suitable for the purpose. The key information
                       to be documented is:

                           Subtasks
                           Skills
                           Knowledge for each task

                       The development team will want to ensure they capture
                       information dealing with the performance of each of these areas.
                       This information may include environmental conditions, tools
                       needed, and TOs used, as well as the task performance
                       standards in the work center. Example forms that can be used to
                       document this process are shown in Tables 1 and 2.


Reviewing and          When task breakdowns are completed, review them with subject
validating analysis    matter experts (SME). This will help validate the completeness
data                   and accuracy of the information and ensure that all required
                       equipment has been identified. Ensure that each step or subtask
                       required to perform the task has been identified. This may
                       include any Major Command (MAJCOM) or local procedure. If
                       the analysis has identified that there are several ways to perform
                       a task, check with the SME in the work center to identify the most
                       appropriate way to perform each task.

                                  Section B
                     Identify Existing Training Sources

Introduction        Once the training tasks have been identified, the next step in the
                    process is to identify existing training programs that can be used
                    to meet the identified training requirements. Listed below are
                    several current training programs. These programs may be used
                    in conjunction with the training provided within the individual work
                    centers.


Field or            Field or replacement training can be accomplished using several
replacement         methods. Some of the methods are:
training
                       Career Development Courses (CDC)
                       Contract training
                       Specialized courses such as:
                       Auxiliary Maintenance Qualification Training Package
                       (AMQTP)
                       Computer training packages (including software)
                       Supply training classes


Qualification       Qualification Training Packages (QTPs) are normally developed
training packages   by career field managers and contain task knowledge,
                    performance requirements, or instructions on how to train a
                    particular task. Supervisors and trainers will use a QTP when
                    conducting training. Many of the QTPs contain study material for
                    the trainee to gain the necessary knowledge about a task. A
                    complete listing of all available QTPs can be found in the Air
                    Force or MAJCOM 0-8 index.


Specialized         Specialized Training Packages (STP) are developed by Air
training packages   Education and Training Command (AETC) for completion at the
                    individual's assigned unit. The training is accomplished using
                    local resources, with a qualified technician serving as the
                    instructor. Upon completion of the STP, the trainee's
                    performance is evaluated by AETC and the certification or
                    diploma is sent back to the home station. The available STPs are
                    listed in AFCAT 36-2223.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 11       1 November 2002                                          86



                                  Section C
                         Determine Training Objectives

Introduction          After the development team has reviewed existing training
                      sources, the next activity is to determine the training objectives.
                      Once it has been determined what the training objectives are, a
                      decision must be made as to "how" the objectives are going to be
                      met.


What is an            An objective simply states the desired outcome after the training
objective?            has been provided.


Documenting the       In order to remain clear on the training objective while designing
objective             the training, it is recommended the objective be documented in
                      statement format. The objective statement will also serve as the
                      basis for evaluation of the trainee's performance.


Parts of an           The objective statement can be broken down into three parts:
objective
                         Condition
                         Performance/behavior
                         Standard

                      The performance/behavior should always be included in an
                      objective statement, but the condition and standard may be
                      implied or assumed. The best objective clearly states all three.


Determining           A good method for determining training objectives is to ask
training objectives   several questions focusing on the three parts of an objective. For
                      example, for each task, ask the following questions:

                         What should the trainee be able to do if the training is to be
                         successful?
                         How well should the trainee be able to perform?
                         What are the circumstances under which the trainee should
                         be able to perform?
AFH 36-2235       Volume 11      1 November 2002                                        87




Determining           Answering questions such as these will help the development
training objectives   team to develop the training objectives. These questions are
(Continued)           further addressed in the following parts of this section.


First question        What should the trainee be able to do if the training is to be
                      successful? The performance/behavior part of the objective
                      statement answers this question. It identifies exactly what the
                      trainee is required to accomplish. This is true for both
                      performance-oriented actions (tasks or hands-on activities) and
                      knowledge-oriented actions (facts/concepts/principles). The
                      actions described should be measurable and observable and
                      should match closely with the tasks identified in the analysis
                      phase. When developing this part of the objective, ensure that
                      the verb precedes the rest of the statement.

                      Example of Performance:

                         Repair J-58 fuel pump.
                         Prepare AF Form 2096.
                         Remove and replace B-52 engine oil pressure gauge.

                      Example of Knowledge:

                         Name the safety hazards in refueling a B-1 aircraft.
                         Identify the tools needed to repair a J-58 fuel pump.

                      If the performance examples look familiar, it may be because
                      they are the same type of statement found on training standards.
                      By itself, the performance/behavior part may also be called a
                      behavioral statement. Be sure the verb is measurable. For
                      example, the verb "know" is ambiguous.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 11      1 November 2002                                         88



Second question      How well should the trainee be able to perform? During the
                     analysis phase, data was collected about the required
                     performance standard in the work center, so the basis for this
                     part of the objective statement already exists. The standard
                     states how well the trainee should perform each task. There are
                     many methods to describe the standard in an objective. Some
                     examples are:

                         In accordance with (IAW) external authority (policy directive
                         (PD), TO, checklist, etc.).
                         Percentage or number of errors.
                         Repetition of testing (e.g., two consecutive tests).
                         Physical tolerances (e.g., weight, rate, distance, degrees).
                         Time for completing the task.
                         Quality of finished product.
                         Degree of assistance/supervision.

                     There are certain tasks in which errors are permissible as long as
                     these errors do not affect mission accomplishment. To determine
                     this, decide whether errors are permissible in the performance
                     task. Naturally, critical tasks need to be completed with 100
                     percent accuracy, but not every task is critical. In fact, the
                     "Go/No Go" level is based on whether the individual can do the
                     task or not.

                     This part of the objective statement may be written or implied. If
                     the trainee must perform without errors, is it any clearer to state
                     "no errors" than to imply it? Supervisors should decide based on
                     what works best for their work center and what is the most clear
                     to all concerned.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 11      1 November 2002                                            89



Third question      What are the circumstances under which the trainee should be
                    able to perform? This portion, the condition, states what is to be
                    denied, provided, given, or used during the performance by the
                    trainee. Like the standard, this information was also collected
                    during the analysis phase. The condition can make the specifics
                    of what is to be performed more clear. Everyone likes to know
                    what to expect when it is time to show what they can do.

                    The condition can be described in many different ways, such as:

                        Materials and equipment needed.
                        References needed or allowed (e.g., TOs, checklist).
                        Restrictions or limitations of performance.
                        Physical environment.
                        Simulation used.
                        Assistance or supervision provided.

                    It may not be necessary to state this part of the objective
                    statement. Many times the condition can be implied or assumed
                    as with the standard. For example, if the trainee is not allowed to
                    have assistance or supervision during the evaluation of the task,
                    is it clearer to state this fact? Also, for example, in sections within
                    a work center a technical order (TO) is required to perform all
                    tasks. In such cases, is the statement made clearer by stating
                    the TO as a condition of performing the task or can it be assumed
                    as a work center policy?

                    If the condition is not stated, then it can be understood that only
                    those items needed to complete the task will be used.
                    Supervisors should decide based on what works best for their
                    work center and what is the most clear and effective to all
                    concerned. If in doubt when to list all three parts of an objective,
                    it is best to list them all.

                               Section D
                    Determine Evaluations and Criteria

Introduction        The objective states the outcome if the training is successful;
                    therefore, supervisors and trainers need to know when the
                    outcome of the objective has been achieved. This is
                    accomplished by evaluating the trainee's ability to do what is
                    stated in the objective. The method used to evaluate will vary,
                    depending on whether the objective is performance- or
                    knowledge-oriented. Use a performance scenario to assess
                    performance and written or oral questions to measure knowledge.
                    When evaluating both, the two measurements can be combined.
                    Ensure that evaluation requirements for scoring are standardized
                    for the trainees.


How are             Evaluations can be used for:
evaluations used?
                       Certifying tasks.
                       Providing feedback on training.
                       Determining if remedial training is warranted.


Types of            Some of the types of evaluations that can be used are:
evaluations
                       Informal practice exercises.
                       In-house evaluations.
                       Formal evaluations.
                       Third-party certifications.

                    Performance, written, and oral evaluations are further explained
                    in the following parts of this section.


Performance         Generally, there are two types of performance evaluations:
evaluations
                       Process evaluations.
                       Product evaluations.

                    In many cases, it may be appropriate to evaluate both the end
                    product and the process used to create it. Performance
AFH 36-2235         Volume 11      1 November 2002                                         91



Performance            evaluations are normally easy to develop because they are based
evaluations            on what the trainee is required to perform (the objective). If the
(Continued)            trainee is required to "repair actuators," then that is what the
                       performance evaluation should measure.

                       The more difficult part is developing the evaluation tool used to
                       rate the performance. Using the following guidelines will help
                       make the job of developing an evaluation tool much easier.


Guidelines for         Guideline points:
developing
performance              Include the desired performance/behavior used in the
evaluation tools         objective statement.
                         List the equipment, references, or supplies needed to
                         complete the task.
                         Include general instructions such as:
                         What the trainee is to do.
                         What will be evaluated and when (process, product, or both).
                         When the trainee should actually start the task.
                         Time requirements.
                         Assistance or supervision allowed.
                       Specific directions needed for portions of the evaluation.

                       An example of a performance evaluation is shown in Table 3 as a
                       student progress checklist.


Performance            Checklists are one of the most reliable and recommended
evaluation tools:      devices to score performance evaluations. Existing TO checklists
Checklists             may be used or new checklists may be developed for the
                       purpose. If a checklist is developed, it should include the
                       information and details about the task that were collected during
                       the analysis phase. Some guidelines for developing checklists
                       are:

                           Include instructions to the evaluator. This may include:
                           How to use the checklist.
                           How many items must be marked "SAT" to pass the overall
                           evaluation?
                           Whether the evaluator should be rating the process, product,
                           or both.
AFH 36-2235         Volume 11      1 November 2002                                            92



Performance            Include in the process checklist items such as:
evaluation tools:         Steps of the task.
Checklists                Order in which the steps of the task should be performed.
(Continued)               Mention in the introduction or before the first step whether the
                          order of task performance is mandatory.

                       Include in the product checklist items such as:
                          The scoreable characteristics of the product. These
                          characteristics include things that distinguish a satisfactory
                          product from an unsatisfactory product, such as:
                          Features of the product that are present or not present (e.g.,
                          signature block in the correct format on an official letter or no
                          typos on a letter).
                          Product characteristics that can be measured (weight, length,
                          voltage, etc.)

                       If the checklist is to be used to evaluate both the process and
                       product, then list the steps and the scoreable characteristics as a
                       checklist item.

Performance            After the checklist has been developed, ensure that the passing
evaluation tools:      grade or score is based on the objective for performing the task.
Task scoring           Some of the items that will help to score a task include:

                           Assigning each step of the task a point total. Some steps of
                           task performance may not be as critical as others; therefore,
                           assign less critical steps a smaller point value.

                           Identify what constitutes a passing or failing score in the
                           checklist instructions. Some areas, such as safety, may be
                           considered as an automatic failure if violated. If so, include
                           this in the instructions as well.


Performance            Several forms can be used to document and sequence the
evaluation tools:      checklist similar to an AF Form 2519. If desired, a special form
Documentation          may be created for the purpose. Work center supervisors or
                       trainers should use whichever form is suitable for the purpose.
                       Work centers with TO checklists or job guides may prefer using
                       them in conjunction with instructions to the evaluator as to how to
                       score each task.


Oral evaluations       Oral and performance evaluations can be used to evaluate task
                       knowledge. Oral questions require individuals to explain why
                       they are performing certain functions. Ask questions only after a
                       step of the task has been completed, never during the
                       performance of the step. It is difficult to work and talk at the
                       same time, especially if the task is complex. Also, avoid yes or
                       no questions since they do not require the trainees to explain
                       anything, and thus, little is learned about their understanding of
                       the steps of the tasks.

                       Document the questions to be asked so they can be used by the
                       evaluators to ensure that each trainee is asked the same
                       questions. Asking the same questions of each student ensures
                       the quality of the evaluation process as well as the quality of the
                       trainee's performance.


Written evaluations    Written evaluations may also be used in addition to performance-
                       and oral-type evaluations. The basic requirements for written
                       evaluations are provided below. Additional information on
                       developing written evaluations can be found in AFMAN 36-2236.
AFH 36-2235        Volume 11      1 November 2002                                          95



Developing the        Instructions for the written evaluation should include information
written evaluation    such as:

                          Text/references allowed to be used during the evaluation.
                          Time allotted to complete the evaluation.
                          Number of items on the evaluation.
                          Special instructions for answering specific evaluation items.
                          Minimum passing score.
                          Examples of how a correct response is marked.
                          How to change a response, if necessary.
                          Indication of whether the trainees can proceed independently
                          or whether they must wait to proceed from one section to the
                          next.


Written               There are two basic formats for written questions:
evaluations:
Question formats          Selection.
                          Supply.

                      Selection items include:

                          Multiple choice.
                          Matching.
                          True-false.

                      Scoring selection items is more objective than scoring supply
                      items because the correct answer is chosen from provided
                      responses.

                      Supply items include:

                          Essay.
                          Short answer.
                          Completion.



Written               These items require that an evaluator judge the response. This
evaluations:          can lead to different scores or ratings from different evaluators.

Written evaluation:   Selection-type tests are easy to score since only one answer is
Scoring               correct. However, as with any test, a minimum acceptable score
procedures            for the test as a whole must be determined. Check MAJCOM
                      and local policy before deciding on the minimum passing score
                      for a test. Once the passing score has been determined, look at
                      the number of answers and assign an equal number of points for
                      each answer. When scoring the test, match the student's
                      response to the answer key and subtract the number of incorrect
                      answers. Then multiply the number of correct responses by the
                      assigned point value for the total score.

                      The process is a little more complicated for supply-type tests.
                      For these, determine what is to be the written reply. This
                      includes whether an exact answer must be given or the test
                      evaluator is allowed to interpret the response. If an interpretation
                      is allowed, then decide what major points will be included and
                      how, if at all. Partial credit may be given. Then write the correct
                      response and all variances down, and explain the procedures to
                      the test evaluators. Try to eliminate as much subjectivity as
                      possible. This type of question is more difficult to grade and can
                      cause disagreements on whether the trainee knows the subject
                      matter.

                               Section E
                      Determine Training Sequence

Introduction      The tasks to be trained were determined during the initial
                  evaluation, in the analysis phase. This allowed efforts to be
                  concentrated on the most important training requirements and job
                  tasks. When prioritizing the tasks, remember this list is only a
                  guide to the order in which tasks should be trained.
                  Circumstances may arise that require a task to be trained, or a
                  series of tasks, out of the predetermined order. For example,
                  during a training session, operational equipment may not be
                  available to complete a particular task; therefore, it may be
                  necessary to train other tasks out of sequence. The rate and
                  ease at which students learn can also impact the training order.

                  Areas to consider when prioritizing tasks are:

                      Mission requirements.
                      Task requirements.
                      Trainer availability.
                      Equipment availability.
                      Ease of learning.
                      Supporting knowledge.

                  These considerations are further discussed in the following parts
                  of this section.


Mission           Since the training program being developed will focus on mission
requirements      accomplishment, tasks directly associated with mission
                  accomplishment are normally most critical. Critical tasks are
                  those needed to successfully accomplish the mission. Tasks
                  critical to the mission may be a high priority for training and
                  should be accomplished first.

                  Also, look at how often the task must be performed. Frequently
                  performed tasks may be high on the priority list. A task
                  performed every day is also easier to train than one performed
                  once every six months since the trainees have more chances for
                  practice and reinforcement.
AFH 36-2235        Volume 11       1 November 2002                                           98



Task requirements      The next factor to consider is the training task itself. Consider
                       how difficult the task is to perform. Task difficulty can be
                       estimated by the subject matter experts (SME) or supervisor.
                       Generally, more time will have to be spent teaching difficult tasks
                       in order to guarantee proficiency. However, there is a simple
                       solution: move the task higher on the priority list in order to start
                       the training sooner so more time can be spent training the task.
                       Also, some tasks may serve as "building blocks" for other tasks,
                       which will normally require that they be trained first.


Support equipment      Another factor to consider that may affect the priority assigned to
availability           a given task is the availability of the equipment needed to
                       conduct the training. For example, equipment needed to train an
                       on-the-job training task may also be used to meet field training
                       requirements; therefore, the equipment will have to be shared.
                       Also, calibration or scheduled maintenance requirements can
                       impact equipment availability during training sessions.


Trainer availability   The number of qualified personnel available to meet training
                       requirements is another issue to be considered. The number of
                       trainers and their qualifications will impact how training is
                       prioritized. If trainers are not available when they are needed, it
                       may be necessary to conduct training in groups instead of one-
                       on-one. Also, it may be necessary to develop "in-house training
                       classes" within the work center to offset the lack of trainer
                       availability.


Ease of learning       A great deal is known about how individuals learn and how to
                       present information so they will learn faster and remember
                       longer. There are also several methods of sequencing task
                       training to make the learning process easier for the trainee. The
                       sequencing methods are:

                          Job performance order.
                          Psychological order.
                          Logical order.

                       These sequencing methods are further described below.
AFH 36-2235        Volume 11       1 November 2002                                         99




Ease of learning      Job Performance Order
(Continued)
                          Job performance order requires tasks to be arranged in the
                          order in which they would be performed on the job. Use the
                          list of prioritized tasks and sequence them to be trained in the
                          job performance order. This method applies both to tasks and
                          to the procedural steps involved in performing the tasks.

                      Psychological Order

                          Psychological order requires tasks to be sequenced based on
                          which are easiest to learn. In essence, trainees learn the
                          simple before the complex. Consider using this method if a
                          task is particularly hard to master or if a person is having
                          trouble learning. It helps the trainee build up confidence and
                          learn the basics prior to starting more difficult tasks.

                      Logical Order

                          Logical order is most often used because it is a blend of the
                          job performance and psychological methods of sequencing.
                          Workers are trained on the easiest tasks first, whenever
                          possible. Each task is taught in the order it is normally
                          performed, but when the hardest parts of the task are
                          reached, trainers take over while the trainee watches. Little
                          by little, the trainers allow the trainee to accomplish the harder
                          steps of the task until they are able to perform all parts of the
                          task.


Supporting            Performance tasks are difficult to train until knowledge about the
knowledge             performance is provided. Therefore, when determining the
                      priority of the task to be trained, consider the priority of the
                      supporting knowledge training requirements. Prepare a list of
                      references to accompany each task. Then, have the trainees
                      review the reference material before being trained on the task to
                      gain an understanding of what is required to be done.

                      If there is a career development course (CDC), specialized
                      course (SC), or qualification training package (QTP) available
                      that addresses specific tasks, match up the appropriate volumes
                      and sections to the task to be trained. Ask the trainees to
                      document any questions they have about the supporting material
                      so they can get the answers they need.
AFH 36-2235     Volume 11      1 November 2002                                       100



                                Section F
                        Determine Training Methods

Introduction       Once it has been determined what needs to be trained, it is
                   necessary to determine what methods to use to train each of the
                   required tasks. There are several methods that can be used to
                   train a task. Three of the most common methods are:

                       Lecture.
                       Coach/pupil.
                       Demonstration/performance.

                   These methods are described below.


Lecture            The lecture method is normally used for the more basic types of
                   learning such as how to complete a form. It is also an effective
                   method of providing many of the unit training requirements as
                   well as the supporting knowledge for performance tasks. Caution
                   should be used when using this delivery method to ensure it does
                   not become boring, thus affecting the learning process. This
                   method can be used when it is necessary to provide a large
                   number of trainees the same information on a task or series of
                   tasks.


Coach / pupil      The coach/pupil method is a hands-on training method. This
                   method provides the one-on-one training that is essential in most
                   on-the-job training (OJT) environments. It is like having a mentor
                   who guides the trainee through each step of a performance task.
                   The coach/pupil method encourages greater learning because
                   each trainee receives individual attention. This method works
                   best when the number of trainees is small or if there are sufficient
                   trainers available.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 11        1 November 2002                                     101



Demonstration /      In the demonstration/performance method, trainees are told what
performance          is to be done and shown how to do it by the trainer. Then the
                     trainee performs the task with the trainer observing each step of
                     the task as it is being performed and asking questions of the
                     trainee to check the trainee's complete understanding of the task
                     and supporting knowledge requirements. This method consists
                     of four phases:

                         Explanation
                         Demonstration
                         Performance
                         Evaluation

                     The following table shows the activity associated with each phase
                     of the demonstration/performance method.

                         Phase                Activity
                     Explanation       Trainer tells trainees exactly what is to be done
                                             and the materials to be used.
                     Demonstration Trainer demonstrates how to perform the task.
                     Performance       Trainees practice performing the task.
                     Evaluation        Trainer rates the trainees' ability to perform the
                                             task according to the standard defined in
                                             the objective. Do not evaluate the
                                             trainees' performance until they have had
                                             adequate practice performing the task.

                                     Section G
                              Determine Training Media

Introduction         There are many types of instructional media available such as
                     instructors, computers, and actual equipment. Many of the media
                     types are described later in this section. Determining or selecting
                     the appropriate training media for a given training scenario is
                     based on a number of factors and is a major concern in the
                     training design process.


Media selection      There are a number of factors to consider when selecting the
factors              media for a given training situation. Some of the factors to
                     consider are:

                         Effectiveness
                         Realism in the learning process
                         Ease of use
                         Development and maintenance cost


Types of media       There are many types of media that can be used to deliver
                     training and reinforce the learning process. Each training
                     situation will require analysis to determine which are the best
                     media to use. Determining and selecting the appropriate training
                     media during the training design phase will help ensure that the
                     training program is effective and cost-efficient. Some of the
                     training media available are:

                         Actual equipment
                         Print-based material
                         Job aids
                         Mockups
                         Simulators and trainers
                         Interactive courseware (ICW)
                         Filmstrips
                         Television
                         Transparencies
                         Flat pictures
                         Chalkboards
AFH 36-2235        Volume 11      1 November 2002                                         103



Types of media        You will probably not use all of these types of media in any given
(Continued)           situation. A brief discussion of each media type is provided
                      below.


Types of media:       One of the best media available for training a performance task is
Actual equipment      the actual equipment on which the trainee will be working on a
                      daily basis. Using the actual equipment reinforces realism and
                      increases transfer of the information from the training
                      environment to the job.


Types of media:       Print-based material includes items such as directives, manuals,
Print-based           handbooks, and technical orders (TO) which are normally used in
material              performance of the job. Using the actual printed materials that
                      trainees will use on the job instills realism in the training program.
                      Also consider commercial publications, career development
                      courses (CDC), qualification training packages (QTP), or even
                      locally developed materials for use in the training program.


Types of media:       Job aids are tools to use during performance of a task. They may
Job aids              include samples, "cheat sheets," or operating instructions (OI).
                      Some equipment may also have quick reference instructions or
                      owner's manuals that could be used as job aids. Technical
                      orders can also be considered as job aids.


Types of media:       A mockup may be a two- or three-dimensional representation of
Mockups               the original. It can be used for study, training, or testing in place
                      of the real object, which may be too costly, dangerous to operate,
                      or difficult or impossible to obtain.


Types of media:       If the actual equipment is not available for training, consider using
Simulators and        a simulator or trainer. Simulators and trainers provide the trainee
trainers              with a realistic setting and allow for good transfer of learning to
                      the actual piece of equipment.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 11      1 November 2002                                      104



Types of media:      Several types of media fall in the category of ICW. Computer-
Interactive          assisted instruction (CAI) courses are developed for use with
Courseware (ICW)     standard Air Force automated systems. This method is good for
                     providing basic information. Trainees bring the lesson up on a
                     computer screen, work through it, and answer any required
                     questions. Programs are available to teach problem solving or to
                     simulate dangerous or expensive situations. Newer technology
                     makes use of video and compact disc (CD) in conjunction with
                     the computer.


Types of media:      Filmstrips may be used to show how a task is performed. They
Filmstrips           can be used alone, or you can incorporate sound on tape with the
                     filmstrip. Filmstrips work well to support fairly static tasks.


Types of media:      Television includes the use of videocassette recorders (VCR).
Television           When used with VCRs, television can be an effective teaching
                     aid. As the VCR tape is being made, the operator has control of
                     the shots and different angles used.

                         Define Resource Requirements

Introduction         One of the key factors in designing unit training or on-the-job
                     training (OJT) is resources. Throughout the entire Instructional
                     System Development (ISD) process, resources will always be a
                     major concern. Regardless of the role in the training system,
                     everyone has a resource responsibility. During the design phase,
                     the development team should define the resource requirements
                     for the training program. Resources as used in this handbook are
                     defined on page 52. Sources that 52


Equipment and        There are several steps that can be followed, as a guideline, to
tools                define or identify requirements for equipment and tools to conduct
                     unit training or OJT programs. The steps are shown in the
                     following table.

                         Step    Activity             Purpose
                     1           Review training      To identify major equipment
                                 standard(s).         requirements.
                     2           Review task          To determine types and
                                 breakdown and        numbers of equipment and tools
                                 training             required for one individual to
                                 references.          perform the task.
                     3           Review number of     To determine total amount of
                                 trainees.            equipment and tools required to
                                                      perform the task.
                     4           Plan for             To determine how trainees will
                                 equipment and        use or share equipment and
                                 tool usage.          tools for tasks requiring team
                                                      performance or when a resource
                                                      is limited.


Identify equipment   The performance/behavior of the objectives should identify what
and tools            major pieces of equipment will be required to provide adequate
                     training to the trainees. Task breakdowns should also specify all
                     other equipment and tools required to complete the task. The
                     required equipment and tools, in sufficient quantities, should be
                     on hand before starting the training session.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 11      1 November 2002                                            106



Determine            After the equipment and tools have been identified, make sure of
availability of      their availability. For example, if an aircraft is needed to perform
equipment and        an OJT task, the aircraft should be scheduled for training use;
tools                necessary aircraft support equipment should be available; and
                     close coordination with other maintenance functions is
                     recommended to ensure they are not adversely impacted. The
                     same applies for other major pieces of equipment. Making a
                     phone call the day before the equipment is needed for the
                     training session normally does not work well.

                     A good policy is to always develop alternate plans, such as using
                     or building a trainer or simulator that is an exact duplicate of the
                     original equipment, if the cost can be justified. Another example
                     is to develop training tool kits to be used during the training
                     session rather than issuing tools to each trainee. Issue training
                     tool kits to selected groups of trainees when budget restrictions
                     require trainees to be split into several training groups. This
                     spreads out the available tools to help ensure that training takes
                     place at the scheduled time.


Facilities           Adequate facilities are required to conduct all unit-level training.
                     These facilities should be located in an area conducive to
                     learning. Following are some guidelines to help identify facility
                     requirements for unit training.

                         Step       Activity            Purpose
                     1              Review facility     To identify type of facility
                                    requirements.       required. Consider size,
                                                        location, and accessibility
                                                        (handicapped, parking, security
                                                        clearance).
                     2              Determine           To determine if facility is
                                    availability of     conducive to training (e.g.,
                                    facility.           limited distractions).
                     3              Plan utilization    To make sure the facility is
                                    of facility.        available when needed.

Human resources      Several individuals play a key role in designing, developing and
                     conducting successful training programs. Some of these
                     individuals are:

                     Curriculum developers. These individuals have the responsibility
                     to design training programs based on inputs from SMEs,
                     supervisors, trainers, and others.

                     Supervisors. These individuals are responsible for identifying
                     training requirements. They must be aware of the qualifications
                     of all work center personnel and determine if any training is
                     needed to fulfill mission requirements.

                     Trainers. These individuals are responsible for providing quality
                     training to the trainees. They must be highly qualified and
                     motivated in order to be effective.

                     Trainees. These individuals have the responsibility to learn to
                     perform their assigned jobs to the best of their ability.

                     There are several steps that can be followed, as a guideline, to
                     assist in identifying human resource requirements needed to
                     conduct training programs. They are:

Money            During the planning process the requirements for equipment,
                 facilities, and personnel are identified. Once these resources are
                 identified it is time to determine the funds required for these
                 resources.

                 There are several steps that can be used as guidelines for
                 identifying the funding requirements. The steps are:

                                                     are met.


Time             How much time is available? How much time does it take to train
                 each task? Can time be scheduled to provide the training? Are
                 trainers and trainees available for the training period? In order to
                 answer questions such as these, the steps in the following table
                 can be used as guidelines for determining the amount of time
                 required.

                                        Overview

Introduction          After the design phase of the Instructional System Development
                      (ISD) process has been completed and the training system has
                      been designed, it is time to implement that design by developing
                      the training. In the development phase of the ISD process, all of
                      the training development team's planning, analysis, and design
                      efforts come together to develop the required unit training or on-
                      the-job training (OJT) program. Remember, when developing
                      training, the goal is to develop effective, cost-efficient training.
                      This can be achieved by continually focusing on the quality of the
                      development process and the products of the process.


Where are you in      To this point, the necessary analysis and design activities have
the process?          been completed and it is time to enter the development phase.

                              Develop Training Guides

Introduction         Training guides or lesson plans are essential to unit and on-the-
                     job training programs. As the name states, they serve as guides
                     for the supervisor or trainer to conduct training. The requirement
                     for training guides and their format can be determined by the
                     Major Command (MAJCOM) or the local units. Training guide
                     development is discussed in later parts of this section.


Purpose              The purpose of the training guide to standardize the instruction.
                     In other words, training guides ensure that all trainees receive the
                     same training. Standardizing training improves the overall quality
                     of the training program.


Developing           As previously stated, there is no set requirement for training
training guides      guide format. However, it is recommended that consideration be
                     given to using the three-part training guide format. The three
                     main parts of a training guide are:

                         Introduction
                         Development (body)
                         Conclusion

                     An example of a training guide is included in Table 4. Each of
                     these parts is described below.


Training guide:      The introduction to a training guide or lesson plan has four
Introduction         elements or steps:

                         Attention
                         Motivation
                         Overview
                         Transition

                     These four elements are further described on the next page.

Training guide:      Attention Step
Introduction            The attention step is used to alert the trainees that the trainer
(Continued)             is ready to begin the lesson. It is used to gain the attention of
                        the trainees. Trainers often use stories, jokes, or other verbal
                        or nonverbal action to gain their attention.

                     Motivation Step
                       The motivation step is used to gain the trainees' interest in the
                       training. This step may be combined with the attention step.
                       The trainer should explain why it is important for the trainees
                       to learn the information that will be presented during the
                       training session. For example, the trainer may want to explain
                       how the trainees will use the information in the future to
                       perform their overall job.

                     Overview Step

                         An overview provides an explanation of what to expect during
                         the lesson. It normally includes an explanation of the
                         objective and the major teaching steps. This overview
                         provides a "roadmap" to help the trainees follow the lesson.

                     Transition Step
                        The transition step allows the trainer to move from the
                        introduction to the body of the teaching guide or lesson plan.
                        It also is used to focus the trainees' attention on the first major
                        teaching step.


Training guide:      The development part of the training guide is titled either
Development          "development" or "body". This part contains information taught to
(body)               the trainees. There are numerous ways to format or write the
                     body of the lesson plan. There are one- and two-page formats,
                     as well as a two-column format.

                     The single page format is like writing a letter or a book. The
                     teaching steps are listed along with any trainer's personalization
                     that might be added.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 11      1 November 2002                                       113




Training guide:      The two-page format has the teaching steps (for the trainer) on
Development          the left-hand page and the trainer's personalized notes on the
(body)               right-hand page.
(Continued)
                     The two-column format is similar to the two-page format. The
                     teaching steps are identified in the left-hand column while the
                     trainer's personalized notes are in the right-hand column.

                     Regardless of the format, use task breakdowns to complete the
                     body of the lesson plan. The task breakdown contains all of the
                     steps, skills, knowledge, and procedures required to complete a
                     task. This ensures that all information required to complete a
                     task is contained within the lesson plan, thus assuring effective
                     and quality training.


Training guide:      The conclusion is used to end the lesson. It has three parts:
Conclusion             Summary
                       Re-motivation
                       Closure

                     These three parts are further described below.

                     Summary
                       The summary is used to remind the trainees of the objective
                       and major teaching steps of the lesson. This step allows
                       trainees to review the information learned and clear up any
                       misconceptions. New information should not be included in
                       the summary.

                     Re-motivation
                       The re-motivation step allows the trainer to remind the
                       trainees why it is important to remember what was taught and
                       how the information applies to them. The trainer may use the
                       same or similar examples from the motivation step in the
                       introduction.

                     Closure
                        The closure statement or action is to let the trainees know the
                        lesson is over. Examples of lesson closures include using a
                        quote, giving advice, transition to another lesson, or whatever
                        will let the trainee know that the lesson is finished.

                                   Section B
                       Develop or Acquire Training Media

Introduction          During the design phase, the development team determined the
                      most effective, cost-efficient training media that should be used
                      for each lesson in the training program. In the development
                      phase, the team develops or acquires the training media to
                      present each lesson in the unit or on-the-job training program. In
                      this section, the training media discussed will be the same as
                      those covered in the design chapter in this handbook.


Actual equipment      Being in an operational environment normally means there will be
                      equipment to do the job. For the most part this will be the same
                      equipment needed to conduct the training. However, it is likely
                      this equipment will have to be shared with the operational user.
                      One way to offset this is to provide the training on a real mission
                      requirement. This way the mission and the training task can be
                      accomplished at the same time. The involvement by the trainees
                      will depend on the nature of the mission task to be accomplished
                      and where the trainees are in the training program.


Print-based           Much of the print-based material used to conduct OJT will already
material              be developed and available for use. Like using operational
                      equipment, there is normally a great deal of printed material
                      available which is used to operate and maintain the equipment
                      every day on the job that can also used for training. Examples of
                      print-based material are:

                          Policy directives (PD)
                          Manuals
                          Handbooks
                          Operating instructions (OI)
                          Technical orders (TO)
                          Owner's (commercial) manuals

                      Other existing printed materials such as QTPs, STPs, and CDCs
                      are developed with the OJT program in mind. If these materials
                      are not available for some of the required training, training guides
                      and study materials can be developed and reproduced locally.
                      Many units have microcomputers outfitted with a number of good,
                      "user- friendly" word processing programs that will aid in the
                      development of training materials.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 11      1 November 2002                                       116



Job aids            There are many choices in format, design, and materials that can
                    be used when developing job aids for training purposes.
                    Examples of some of the most common job aids are:

                        Instruction plate on a hot water heater.
                        Instructions on a credit card telephone.
                        Instructions with a VCR on how to "hook it up."

                    If the job aid is to be used to remember the steps of a task, use
                    the task breakdown as a guide. A job aid can also be used as an
                    example of a finished product. A Job Aids checklist from a
                    technical order (TO) may be enough by itself or it can be used as
                    the basis for a job aid to which more detail can be added.
                    Services such as the local audiovisual services or printing plant
                    may be required to assist in the development of more elaborate
                    job aids.


Mockups             If it is not convenient or safe to use the actual equipment or to
                    conduct training in the actual job environment, it may be effective
                    and cost-efficient to build or procure a mockup to use for training
                    purposes. Some bases have a trainer fabrication shop to help
                    with the design and development of the mockup. The mockup
                    does not have to look exactly like the actual equipment, but to be
                    effective as a training aid it needs to operate like the actual
                    equipment. The audiovisual services may also be able to help
                    with the design and development of simple mockups.


Simulators and      Normally, simulators and trainers are more complex and
trainers            expensive than mockups and often look like the actual equipment
                    being simulated. Before designing and developing simulators or
                    trainers, ensure that the cost can be justified. The acquisition
                    process for simulators and trainers is often very similar to that of
                    the mockup. If the base fabrication shop has the necessary
                    experience, they can normally help design and develop
                    simulators and trainers to be used for training purposes.
                    However, the more sophisticated, expensive simulators and
                    trainers are normally procured by the Air Force from civilian
                    contractors who are responsible for design and development.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 11      1 November 2002                                      117



Interactive         Some interactive courseware is developed by Air Education and
courseware          Training Command (AETC) and forwarded to the field. Entry and
                    completion are controlled at the base level; however, these
                    courses are announced in AFCAT 36-2223. Using an authoring
                    system, computer-assisted instruction (CAI) lessons can be
                    developed in the field for local use. More information on
                    developing interactive courseware can found in AFMAN 36-2235,
                    Volume 5. If necessary, ICW can be procured through the
                    normal procurement process at the local base or a MAJCOM
                    level.


Filmstrips          Equipment for developing filmstrips can be purchased by the
                    local unit. However, it may be more cost-efficient to have the
                    base audiovisual (AV) services develop the filmstrips. Some AV
                    centers allow the local units to develop filmstrips using their
                    laboratory and will also provide assistance and guidance as
                    necessary. They may allow equipment to be checked out so the
                    local unit can develop their own filmstrips. If the AV center is to
                    develop the filmstrips, the development team will need to provide
                    the technical content information and serve as subject matter
                    experts (SME).


Videotape           Videotape and audiovisual technology have been effectively and
                    cost-efficiently used as a training delivery method for years.
                    Affordable video cameras and videocassette recorders (VCR)
                    have increased the popularity and use of this delivery method at
                    the unit level. Although some training units may have the
                    capability to produce videotapes for training, most do not. Be
                    aware that bases normally have audiovisual personnel who may
                    be able to assist you in developing videotapes or other
                    audiovisuals for training. Also, some MAJCOMSs have
                    Detachments that develop audiovisual training for specific
                    defense systems. These Detachments may be able to assist you
                    in developing unit level training.


Transparencies      Transparencies can be made using word processors and copiers
                    or graphics packages that will run on the microcomputer.
AFH 36-2235     Volume 11     1 November 2002                                      118



Flat pictures      Pictures can be taken and developed by the AV center or taken
                   by the training development team, with the development being
                   done by the center. Some print media contain figures that are
                   suitable for use and can be copied on a copier for use in the
                   training program.


Chalkboard         The chalkboard is the most versatile media if spontaneity is
                   required. Portable chalkboards are comparatively inexpensive
                   and can be set up almost anywhere. The newer types
                   (markerboards) use colored markers, which enhances the
                   presentation of the information. If working with schematic
                   diagrams, a good way to use the chalkboard is to use an opaque
                   projector to project the diagram on the board and then trace
                   around the image projected on the board.

                                           Section C
                                  Finalize Training Schedule

Introduction             Scheduling training is a very important activity if the training
                         programs that have been developed are to be successful. It goes
                         without saying that scheduling should occur well in advance of
                         the training session, allowing sufficient time for all of the
                         necessary arrangements to be made. Scheduling should not be
                         a haphazard affair; to be effective it should be a controlled
                         process. Scheduling training involves two main activities—
                         selecting trainers and task evaluators, and identifying and
                         scheduling training time. These activities are discussed in this
                         section.


Selecting trainers       A major concern when scheduling training is the availability of
and task                 competent, qualified trainers and task evaluators to provide and
evaluators               evaluate the training. Properly identifying these resources is a
                         critical activity in the training program.

                         A trainer or task evaluator should not be someone who has
                         nothing else better to do. These individuals will be training and
                         evaluating others on a task, or series of tasks, for which the
                         supervisor remains responsible. Therefore, trainers and
                         evaluators should be designated based upon their job experience
                         and ability. It should not be based solely on rank, time in service,
                         or time in the AFS.


Trainer / certifier      Air Force policy sets specific criteria for who can be a trainer or
policy                   task certifier. One basic requirement is that trainers and certifiers
                         will be appointed, trained, and certified. This aids in the selection
                         process by identifying who is qualified and authorized to train and
                         evaluate others. Another requirement is that no one may
                         evaluate the training they provide. Even though an individual
                         may be appointed and qualified to train and certify the same task,
                         training must be evaluated by another qualified evaluator who is
                         not the trainer. This helps to ensure that trainees receive as
                         unbiased an evaluation as possible.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 11        1 November 2002                                      120



Identifying and       One of the most common problems in getting the training
scheduling training   accomplished is finding the time to do the training. Effective time
time                  management will help with the problem of not having time to do
                      the training. There are days when it will be very hard to get any
                      training accomplished due to mission requirements. However,
                      have the trainees observe the tasks being performed so they can
                      gain some insight into the task. This also helps the trainees
                      maintain an interest in the training program. Also, there will be
                      numerous days when the workload will not be very heavy,
                      allowing sufficient time for training.

                      An experienced supervisor should be able to estimate the peak
                      work times and schedule training accordingly. Be as flexible as
                      possible when scheduling training. The trainee's program should
                      not be written in stone. If a unique training task needs to be
                      accomplished, have the trainee go along to observe the task
                      being performed.

                      Note: Consider scheduling the normal day-to-day work
                      requirements with "hands-on" training included. Also, consider
                      scheduling the task certifiers to conduct the courses used to train
                      the trainers.

                               Validate Training Program

Introduction          The last activity or step in determining the quality, effectiveness,
                      and cost-efficiency of a work center's training is to validate the
                      program. Validation will identify whether there are problems to be
                      corrected. Correcting identified problems and continually
                      improving the training program ensures a reliable, quality training
                      program. This section describes the validation activities.


Validating the        Before it can be validated, the training program should be
training program      conducted or tried out to see if it does what it is intended to do.
                      There are two ways to try it out:

                          Subject matter expert validation.
                          Trainee validation.

                      These validation methods are further described below.

                      Subject Matter Expert (SME) Validation

                          Who to try the training out on depends on whom the training is
                          for. Have co-workers sit through the training session if it is
                          geared toward the AFSC or work center. If it is for another
                          shop, use their SMEs.

                          Despite whom it is for, observe training and see where
                          problems occur or training can be improved. See how the
                          information is perceived by the trainees. Determine whether
                          the SMEs will have problems understanding what is said, or
                          whether they can perform the procedures based on what they
                          are told. If the SMEs have a problem with the training, it is
                          likely the trainees will also have a problem.

                          This tryout only points out where the problems may occur.
                          The real test is with the trainees themselves.

                      Trainee Validation

                          For this type of validation, use the actual trainees who need
                          the course. The test group should know where problems exist
                          and
AFH 36-2235        Volume 11      1 November 2002                                         122




Validating the            where improvements can be made in the training.
training program          Remember, the training session is for the trainees, not the
(Continued)               trainer. They need to learn the material to be able to perform
                          the job. The better the material is, the more they will learn.
                          Don't be surprised if the trainees identify different problems
                          than the SMEs did.


Revising the          As validation proceeds, problem areas may be pointed out by the
training program      trainees. Errors in one area may cause problems in others. In
                      other words, look for the root cause and forget the symptoms.
                      Problems could be in either objectives, tests, lesson plans, or
                      visual aids used. Each of these problem areas is discussed
                      below.

                      Objective

                          Review the objective to make sure it matches up with the
                          training standard. If the objective does not match the training
                          standard element, then it needs to be revised to match the
                          element in the training standard. When and if the objective
                          and the training standard element match, continue to the next
                          possible problem area.

                      Test

                          Look at the type of test provided. Determine whether it
                          supports the objective. If it matches what is required by the
                          performance/behavior portion of the objective, look at the
                          make-up of the test itself.

                      Knowledge Test. If an oral or written knowledge test is used, look
                      at the stem of the question. Trainees may have pointed out
                      questions that are poorly written or phrased, or do not apply to
                      the objective. Revise or remove these questions from the test.
                      Also, review the scoring procedures. It may be possible an
                      answer key was not used and some of the test responses were
                      mismarked.

                      Performance Test. Make sure the references and materials are
                      those required to perform the task. Next, check the instructions
                      to make sure they are clear and easy to
AFH 36-2235        Volume 11      1 November 2002                                       123



Revising the          understand. Rewrite them if they are not. Then, investigate the
training program      scoring procedures. Review the checklist to make sure:
(Continued)              There are instructions to the evaluator.
                         Task performance steps are identified.
                         Steps are specific enough as to what is to be accomplished.
                         Scoring points are assigned to each step.
                         Evaluators are trained in use of the checklist.

                      When any necessary corrections have been made to the test,
                      then proceed to the next activity, which is reviewing and revising
                      the training guide or lesson plan.

                      Lesson Plan

                          Begin by reviewing the task breakdown. Make sure the
                          necessary subtasks, procedural skills, and supporting
                          knowledge have been identified. Next, check the lesson plan.
                          Determine whether all necessary information is included in the
                          lesson plan. If it is, check on how the lesson was delivered to
                          the trainees. The problem may have occurred because the
                          trainer was not sure of the material being delivered. Once the
                          lesson plan has been reviewed and revised, then look at the
                          training aids.

                      Training Aids

                          Make sure training aids are effective, clear, and readable by
                          the trainees. Revise them if they are not. If using visual aids,
                          it is possible they do not correctly show how a task, or portion
                          of a task, is to be accomplished. Visual aids may also provide
                          something different from what the trainer is teaching during
                          the training session.

                                 IMPLEMENTATION

Introduction          Before implementing a unit training course or an OJT program,
                      make sure the system functions are in place, the supervisors and
                      trainers are prepared to conduct and administer the training, and
                      the required resources such as trainees and trainers, equipment
                      and facilities are available. Once the training is implemented or
                      becomes operational, ensure that the training system receives
                      the necessary support and maintenance. Also, remember to
                      periodically conduct operational evaluations to ensure that the
                      course or program continues to operate effectively and cost-
                      efficiently and to produce trainees who can meet or exceed the
                      job performance standards established by the training standard
                      and the unit.

Objective           The objective of this chapter is to present an outline of various
                    steps or tasks one can take to implement training. They are not

                                    EVALUATION

Introduction          Evaluation is an integral part of the Instructional System
                      Development (ISD) process. During the planning stages of an
                      ISD project, the training development team begins by determining
                      how the process and products of each phase of the ISD process
                      will be evaluated. As the training development team enters or
                      reenters the various phases of the ISD process, evaluation
                      activities play a key role. Planning for and conducting continuous
                      evaluations throughout the entire ISD process ensures
                      continuous quality improvements in the training program.


Where are you in      The ISD model, with evaluation highlighted, is provided in
the process?          Figure 14. As depicted in the model, each stage in the ISD
                      process involves evaluation activities and feedback.

                      various steps or tasks one can take to evaluate the instructional
                      system. Modifying this outline to fit your specific needs and
                      performing the tasks suggested will help determine the
                      effectiveness of an instructional product or process. It will also
                      help determine specific causes for training effectiveness or lack
                      of it and determine changes needed.

                            Conduct review using ISD process on:
                              Mission statement/quality goals
                              Course documents
                              Training documents
                              Training delivery
                              Training media
                              Target population

                        Correct training deficiencies. (Criticality will determine how
                        quickly the deficiencies should be corrected.)
                        Identify mission/structure changes.
                            Weapon system updates
                            New computer system/hardware/software

       knowledge to implement positive change in the work environment. Also see
       Knowledge and Skill.

Advanced Training. A formal course training toward a technical or supervisory level
     Air Force specialty (AFS). Training is for selected career airmen at the advanced
     level of an AFS.

Air Force Enlisted Specialty Training System. The total training process (life cycle)
      used to qualify airmen in their assigned specialty.

Air Force Specialty. A group of duty positions that require common qualification
      identified by a title and code.

Behavior. Any activity, overt or covert, capable of being measured.

Behavioral Objective. See Learning Objective.

Body. Major section of a lesson during which learning activities are sufficiently
     developed to achieve instructional objective. Usually preceded by an
     introduction and followed by a conclusion.

Condition. That portion of a learning objective which describes the
      situation/environment in which the trainees write/express/perform the specified
      behavior. Conditions include any pertinent influence on task performance,
      including any or all of the following: location of performance, environment,
      equipment, manuals, or supervision required.

Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI). The use of computers to aid in the delivery of
    instruction. A variety of interactive instructional modes are used including
    tutorial, drill and practice, gaming, simulations, or combinations. CAI is an
    integral part of computer-based instruction (CBI) and computer-based training
    (CBT).

Computer-Based Instruction (CBI) or Computer-Based Training (CBT). The use of
    computers to aid in the delivery and management of instruction. CBI and CBT
    are synonymous and are used interchangeably. CAI (the delivery of instruction)
    and CMI (computer-managed instruction) are both elements of CBI and CBT.

Computer-Managed Instruction (CMI). The use of computers to manage the
    instructional process in CAI or CBT. Management normally includes functions
    such as registration, pretesting, diagnostic counseling, progress testing, and
AFH 36-2235       Volume 11       1 November 2002                                         138


     posttesting. CMI is also used to schedule and manage training resources such
     as trainers and equipment.
Constraints. Limiting or constraining conditions or factors, such as a policy
     considerations, time limitations, equipment, environmental factors, personnel,
     budgetary, or other resource limitations.

Courseware. Training materials such as technical data, textual materials, audiovisual
     instructional materials, computer-based instructional materials.

Duty. A large segment of the work done by an individual; major divisions of work in a
      job.

Environment. The physical conditions and surroundings in which a job is performed, or
      in which learning takes place, including tools, equipment, and job aids.

Evaluation. A judgment expressed as a measure or ranking of trainee achievement,
      instructor performance, process, application, training material, and other factors
      (see MIL-HDBK-29612).

External Evaluation. The acquisition and analysis of feedback data from outside the
      formal training environment to evaluate the graduate of the instructional system
      in an operational environment.

Field Training. Technical, operator, and other training conducted at operational
       locations on specific systems and associated direct-support equipment for
       maintenance and aircrew personnel. Either a field training detachment or mobile
       training team may conduct.

Instructional System. An integrated combination of resources (trainees, trainers,
      materials, equipment, and facilities), techniques, and procedures performing
      effectively and cost-efficiently the functions required to achieve specified learning
      objectives.

Instructional System Development (ISD). A deliberate and orderly, but flexible,
      process for planning, developing, implementing, and managing instructional
      systems. It ensures that personnel are taught in a cost-efficient way the skills,
      knowledge, and attitudes essential for successful job performance.

Interactive Courseware (ICW). Computer-controlled training designed to allow the
       student to interact with the learning environment through input devices such as
       keyboards and light pens. The trainee's decisions and inputs to the computer
       determine the level, order, and pace of instructional delivery, and forms of visual
       or aural outputs.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 11       1 November 2002                                        139


Internal Evaluation. The acquisition and analysis of feedback and management data
      from within the formal training environment to assess the effectiveness and cost-
      efficiency of the instructional system.

Job. The duties, tasks, and task elements performed by an individual. The job is the
      basic unit used in carrying out the personnel actions of selection, training,
      classification, and assignment.

Job Aid. A checklist, procedural guide, decision table, worksheet, algorithm, or other
      device used by a job incumbent to aid in task performance. Job aids reduce the
      amount of information that personnel must recall or retain.

Job Performance Requirements (JPR). The tasks required of the human component
     of the system, the conditions under which these tasks may be performed, and the
     quality standards for acceptable performance. JPRs describe what people
     should do to perform their jobs.

Job Qualification Standard (JQS). A list of tasks an individual is required to perform

       and after the upgrade training process. It is designed to provide the performance
       skills required to do the job.

Quality Air Force. A management philosophy and a methodology that work together to
      produce continuous process improvements. QAF implements Total Quality
      Management (TQM) in the Air Force.

Quality Improvement (QI). The organized creation of beneficial change;
      improvements made in products procedures, learning, etc.

Reliability. (a) A characteristic of evaluation, which requires that testing instruments
      yield consistent results. (b) The degree to which a test instrument can be
      expected to yield the same result upon repeated administration to the same
      population. (c) The capability of a device, equipment, or system to operate
      effectively for a period of time without a failure or breakdown.

Skill. The ability to perform a job-related activity that contributes to the effective
       performance of a task. Skills involve physical or manipulative activities, which
       often require knowledge for their execution. All skills are actions having specific
       requirements for speed, accuracy, or coordination. Also see Attitude and
       Knowledge.

Specialty Training Standard (STS). An Air Force publication that describes an Air
      Force Specialty (AFS) in general terms of tasks and knowledge that an airman in
      that specialty may be expected to perform or to know on the job. It further serves
      as a contract between Air Education and Training Command (AETC) and the
      functional user as to which of the overall training requirements for an Air Force
      specialty code are taught in formal schools.

Standard. A document that establishes engineering and technical requirements for
     items, equipment, processes, procedures, practices, and methods that have
     been adopted as standard. Standards may also establish requirements for
     selection, application, and design criteria for material. Military standards are
     documents issued within the Department of Defense in accordance with the
     basic policy of the Defense Standardization Program (see MIL-STD-962).

Subject Matter Expert (SME). (a) An individual who has thorough knowledge of a job,
      duties/tasks, or a particular topic, which qualifies him/her to assist in the training

Task. A unit of work activity or operation that forms a significant part of a duty. A task
      usually has clear beginning and ending points and directly observable or
      otherwise measurable processes, frequently but not always resulting in a product
      that can be evaluated for quantity, quality, accuracy, or fitness in the work
      environment. A task is performed for its own sake; that is, it is not dependent
      upon other tasks, although it may fall in a sequence with other tasks in a duty or
      job array.

Task Analysis. The process of describing job tasks in terms of Job Performance
      Requirements (JPR) and the process of analyzing these JPRs to determine
