SUBJECT: AFSOC Guidance Memorandum 23-1, Unit-Purchased Supplies Efficiency

RELEASABILITY: There are no releasability restrictions on this guidance memorandum.

1. By Order of the Commander, Air Force Special Operations Command, this memorandum immediately
implements the Unit-Purchased Supplies Efficiency (Attachment 1), and directs major commands and direct
reporting units to conduct “6S” (sort, straighten, sweep, standardize, sustain, safety) events based on need
and surplus of unit-purchased supplies. Each activity should make surplus supplies available to redistribute
locally to the greatest extent possible and responsibly divest any excess. This initiative is focused on all non-
accountable, non-capitalized supplies purchased via Government Purchase Card, Form 9 or any other means
with a goal to achieve savings through less spending. Compliance with this memorandum is mandatory and
the information herein prevails, in accordance with Air Force Instruction 33-360, Publications and Forms
Management.

2. HQ AFSOC’s AFSO21 Office facilitated an event to establish a standard process to report, make visible
and redistribute excess unit-purchased supplies. As a result, the guidance in Attachment 2 will be
implemented. This memorandum does not apply to Air Force Reserve Command or the Air National Guard.

3. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this memorandum are maintained in
accordance with Air Force Manual 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air
Force Records Information Management System Records Disposition Schedule, or any updated statement
provided by the Air Force Records Management Office (SAF/CIO A6P) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

4. This memorandum becomes void after one year has elapsed from the date of this memorandum, or upon
release of an Air Force publication incorporating the guidance, whichever is earlier. If you have any
questions or concerns, contact MSgt Erin L. Howard, AFSOC/A4RM at DSN 579-2907.
