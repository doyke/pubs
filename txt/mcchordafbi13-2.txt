graph 1.2.4.); corrects the description of runway asphalt (paragraph 1.5.1.); deletes all references to taxi-
way Golf; defines parking ramps as non-movement areas (paragraph 1.5.3.); adds a note to paragraph
1.5.3. that was previously depicted on Attachment 2; adds Echo Ramp to the radio and visual blind spots
(paragraph 1.5.4.); includes the paved surface formerly identified as taxiway Golf under the permanently
closed portions of the airfield listing (paragraph 1.5.6.); clarifies runway suspension procedures and adds
in-flight emergency landing and SEVERE bird watch condition to the listing of mandatory suspensions
(paragraph 1.6.1.); loosens restriction on practice approaches during runway inspection (paragraph 1.7.);
deletes the previously listed “exception” as lighting guidance is included in this instruction (paragraph
1.12.); provides enhanced description of lighting (paragraph 1.12.1.); defines taxiway Foxtrot as the only
unlit taxiway (paragraph 1.12.3.); adds a third note to paragraph 1.13. describing barrier positioning that
was previously noted in Attachment 2; specifically outlines FAA and Air Force criteria for critical areas
(paragraph 2.2. ); corrects an error in the frequency channelization chart (paragraph 2.4.); mandates a call
to Pilot to Dispatch when conducting either IFR or VFR pattern work (paragraph 2.5.2.); generalizes
departure procedures and adds procedures for a VORTAC/VOR/TACAN outage (paragraph 2.5.5.1.);
restricts taxiway Foxtrot only to daytime/VFR use (paragraph 2.6.1.2.); defines taxi restriction by adding
the word “directly” (paragraph 2.7.2.); re-designates engine running crew change locations (paragraphs
2.8.1. and 2.8.2.); restricts low overhead operations (paragraph 3.5.3.); clarifies description of the tower
VFR pattern (paragraphs 3.13.1. and 3.13.2.); clarifies VFR transition procedures (paragraph 3.17.2.);
significantly details reduced same runway separation (paragraph 3.18.); deletes the legal office from sec-
ondary crash net listing (paragraph 4.2.1.14.) replaces outdated term with Emergency Management (para-
graph 4.2.1.10.); replaces outdated term with LRSUCC (paragraph 4.2.1.16.); rewords language use for
traffic pattern/flow restrictions (paragraph 5.3.6.); adds missing reference to paragraph 5.3.8.6.6.; adds
reference to new LOA covering airdrop procedures (paragraph 5.3.6.); clarifies handling of flight check
aircraft (paragraph 5.9.2.); adds flight planning guidance for air carrier and general aviation aircraft (para-

                         FUNCTIONAL MANAGEMENT OF FACILITIES

                                                Chapter 1

     AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, AIRFIELD MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS, AND ATC &
                    LANDING SYSTEM (ATCALS) FACILITIES

1.1. Control Tower. The control tower is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including weekends and
holidays.

1.2. Control Tower Evacuation.
    1.2.1. Circumstances may exist that require the evacuation of the control tower. Evacuate the control
    tower due to:
       1.2.1.1. Tower Wind Limitations.
           1.2.1.1.1. The tower is evacuated when the wind velocity reaches 70 knots (steady or in gusts)
           or when deemed necessary by the watch supervisor/senior controller.
           1.2.1.1.2. Controllers will proceed to Airfield Management Operations (AM Ops) in Bldg
           1172 and standby until the wind diminishes to 65 knots and is forecast to subside.1.2.1.2. Fire.
       1.2.1.2. Bomb Threat.
           1.2.1.2.1. When a bomb is located within 500 feet of the tower.
           1.2.1.2.2. One controller will remain near the tower to assist in re-opening the tower.
       1.2.1.3. Shelter-in-Place: When directed by the 62 AW Emergency Operations Center, implement
       shelter-in-place procedures IAW the 62 AW Contingency Action Plan.
    1.2.2. Tower will activate the Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS) to relay the evacuation action and
    any other pertinent information.
    1.2.3. AM Ops will activate the secondary crash alarm circuit to notify all concerned agencies that the
    tower has been evacuated and issue an appropriate NOTAM.
    1.2.4. The watch supervisor/senior controller ensures all local area traffic lands or diverts and ensures
    a blanket message is broadcast on all assigned frequencies before evacuating for any of the situations
    outlined above.

1.3. Continuity of Air Traffic Services. Based on the control tower's construction and equipment reli-
ability, the 62 OG Commander has determined that a designated alternate control tower facility is not
required at McChord AFB.

1.4. Evacuation of Airfield Management Facility (Bldg 1172). In the event that Bldg 1172 evacuates,
AM Ops personnel will report to the Control Tower (Bldg 8) and standby for further instructions.
MCCHORDAFBI13-2 9 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                           7


1.5. Movement/Non-Movement Areas. The movement area is defined as the runway, overruns, taxi-
ways, and other areas of the airfield which are utilized for taxiing, hover taxiing, air taxiing, takeoff and
landing, exclusive of loading ramps and parking areas.
   1.5.1. Runways: McChord’s runway 16/34 is 10,108 feet long and 150 feet wide. Field elevation is
   322’ MSL. The overruns are 1,000 feet long by 150 feet wide with asphalt composition. The southern-
   most 1,000 feet of the runway is composed of approximately 13 inches of concrete. The remaining
   9,108 feet is flexible asphalt, generally less than 5 inches thick, over crushed gravel. NOTE: Because
   of the flexible construction and relatively narrow (150 feet) width, special restrictions apply to heavy
   aircraft on the flexible portion of the runway. Unless absolutely essential, 180-degree turns on and off
   the flexible portion of the runway are prohibited for heavy aircraft.
   1.5.2. Taxiways: McChord’s taxiways include: Alpha, 100 feet wide (at narrowest point); Bravo, 75
   feet wide; Charlie, 75 feet wide; Delta, 100 feet wide; Echo, 390 feet wide (at narrowest point); Fox-
   trot, 75 feet wide; Hotel, 75 feet wide; Juliet, 75 feet wide, Kilo, 75 feet wide, Lima, 75 feet wide.
   (Attachment 2.)
   1.5.3. Non-Movement Area. Parking ramps are non-movement areas. Primary ramps are Bravo
   B1-B8; Charlie C1-C9, Delta D1-D19 (transient), D25-D31, and D32-D43 (Delta extension); Echo
   E1-E23; Foxtrot F1-F30, F32, F34-F35, F38-F39, F40; Juliet J1-J15; Kilo 2; Lima L1. NOTE: Air-
   craft must use the north Juliet Ramp taxilane to park on spots B-7 and B-8.
   1.5.4. Visual and Radio Blind Spots: Visual blind spots from the control tower without electronic aids
   are: Delta transient ramp located behind Hangars 1 and 2, southwestern portion of Hotel taxiway lead-
   ing to south hammerhead, Juliet taxiway and Echo Ramp. Control tower is not aware of any radio
   blind spots. NOTE: Camera 11 in the cab allows visual of Echo Ramp and camera 8 allows visual of
   Delta transient ramp.
   1.5.5. The Ground NAVAID checkpoint is located at south hammerhead.
   1.5.6. Permanently Closed/Unusable Portions of the Airfield: The north-south taxiway east of taxi-
   way Hotel and west of the landing strip; and the east-west taxiway east of the runway and north of
   taxiway Bravo.
   1.5.7. Use of taxiway Kilo requires 62 OG/CC approval for taxiing aircraft.

1.6. Suspending Runway Operations.
   1.6.1. The tower supervisor or AM Ops supervisor will suspend runway operations (and notify AM
   Ops if necessary) when: a disabled aircraft is on or near the runway; when an in-flight emergency
   lands; when bird watch condition is SEVERE; or when objects have been reported or observed on the
   runway. Prior to resuming normal operations AM Ops personnel will conduct a runway check. If alert
   aircraft are present and the runway is temporarily closed, the Tower supervisor or AM Ops supervisor
   notifies Command Post (CP). CP will notify WADS Mission Crew Commander (MCC).
   1.6.2. After determining that normal operations can be resumed, the AM Ops supervisor reopens the
   runway, advises Tower, and notifies CP of any change in runway status. CP will notify WADS MCC
   when the runway is back to operational status.

1.7. Daily Runway Inspections. AM Ops conducts runway inspections at least once daily. Runway
inspections are given priority to the maximum extent possible; if necessary practice approach aircraft will
receive restricted low approaches during the inspections.

1.8. Runway Selection. Tower will determine the active runway IAW FAAO 7110.65.
    1.8.1. Preferred Runway.
       1.8.1.1. Runway 34 is the preferred runway between 0500L and 2300L, except when tailwind
       component is 5 knots or more.
       1.8.1.2. Conflicting Wind Information. If conflicting wind information is received, Tower super-
       visor will designate runway 34 as the runway in use unless runway 16 is more advantageous due
       to weather, traffic, etc.
    1.8.2. Noise Abatement.
       1.8.2.1. In the interest of fostering positive community relations, the following procedures apply
       between 2300L-0500L, 7 days a week. If surface wind is 10 knots or less and other conditions per-
       mit, Tower coordinates with Seattle Approach Control to designate direction of traffic as follows:
           1.8.2.1.1. Land runway 34. Arriving aircraft will make a straight-in full-stop landing only.
           1.8.2.1.2. Depart runway 16.
       1.8.2.2. Exceptions to noise abatement procedure times must be approved by the 62 OG Com-
       mander. Requests must be received at least 24 hours in advance.

1.9. Runway Change.
    1.9.1. Tower coordinates with Seattle Approach Control, base weather station, and AM Ops.
    1.9.2. AM Ops notifies the 62 AW CP and Barrier Maintenance between 0730L-1630L, Monday-Fri-
    day or the Fire Department during all other times. Upon notification, Barrier Maintenance or Fire
    Department will configure the cables as required.

1.10. Runway Condition Reading (RCR) Check. During cold weather, AM Ops will perform RCR
checks as necessary. Only restricted low approaches are authorized during check periods.

1.11. Airfield Conditions.
    1.11.1. AM Ops provides current information to Tower and the CP on construction, obstructions, and
    airfield conditions. Tower provides AM Ops and Seattle Approach Control with observed or reported
    field conditions and NAVAID outages when such conditions have not been reported by AM Ops.
    1.11.2. 62d Civil Engineering Squadron (CES) personnel maintain the BAK-12/E-5 barrier arresting
    system and airfield lighting systems.
       1.11.2.1. The 62 CES team supervisor will notify AM Ops of the type maintenance, location, and
       hazardous conditions existing during maintenance operations.
       1.11.2.2. The 62 CES team supervisor will notify AM Ops prior to entering the airfield, when
       work is complete, and when departing the airfield.
MCCHORDAFBI13-2 9 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                        9


       1.11.2.3. The 62 CES team supervisor will request permission from the tower to enter, operate,
       and exit the Controlled Movement Area (CMA) IAW 62 AWI 13-4, Flightline Driving.
   1.11.3. 62 CES personnel maintain the grass height at 7 to 14 inches along the taxiways and runway.
   AM Ops ensures grass height is maintained within standards during daily airfield inspections and will
   contact 62 CES personnel when necessary. Any damage to airfield signage will be reported to AM
   Ops immediately.

1.12. Airfield Lighting. Airfield lighting shall be operated IAW FAA Order 7110.65, Air Traffic Con-
trol, and this directive.
   1.12.1. McChord has the following airfield lighting: Rotating beacon, high intensity runway edge
   lights, 1-step taxiway lights, runway centerline lights, non-standard gated threshold lights, precision
   approach path indicators, touchdown zone lights and AMP-1/AMP-3 overt/covert landing zone lights
   (middle 5,000’ of the runway).
       1.12.1.1. Runway 34 has ALSF-2 (Approach Lights with Sequence Flashing Lights).
       1.12.1.2. Runway 16 has ALSF-1 (Approach Lights with Sequence Flashing Lights).
   1.12.2. Runway environment lights (i.e., edge, approach, centerline, touchdown zone, etc.) will be
   turned off except when needed by arriving and departing aircraft. Intensity settings are maintained
   IAW FAA Order 7110.65 at all times to ensure accurate RVR readings. However, Tower may increase
   or decrease intensity settings when specifically requested by the pilot.
   1.12.3. Taxiway lights will be turned off except when required for aircraft ground movement. Taxi-
   way Foxtrot is not equipped with taxiway lights and is for daytime/Visual Flight Rules only (unless
   temporary taxi lights have been installed).

1.13. Aircraft Arresting Systems.
   1.13.1. Standard aircraft arresting system configuration for runways 16/34.
       1.13.1.1. North and South BAK-12s are normally disconnected and removed from the runway.
          1.13.1.1.1. BAK-12 installation requires 30 minutes prior notice. Requests will be made
          through AM Ops.
          1.13.1.1.2. A 15-minute period between successive engagements should be used for planning
          purposes.
       1.13.1.2. The departure end E5 cable for the runway in use is connected on the overrun.
       NOTE 1: To the maximum extent possible, consistent with operational requirements and safety,
       Tower gives priority to Barrier Maintenance/Fire Department personnel when connecting/discon-
       necting arresting systems. AM Ops shall temporarily suspend/close runway operations when
       arresting systems maintenance/configuration changes. During reconfiguration, arriving aircraft
       can expect restricted low approaches and departing aircraft can expect ground delays. Barrier
       Maintenance/Fire Department will respond within 15 minutes to reconfigure cables. AM Ops will
       complete an airfield check and barrier inspection and report the airfield status prior to resuming
       runway operations.

        NOTE 2: When tail-hook equipped aircraft are operating out of McChord AFB, cable configura-
        tion will be different than described above. Normally the departure end BAK-12 and E-5 will be
        connected. Each flying unit will request what cable configuration is desired on a real-time basis.
        NOTE 3: The south E-5 is located 102’ into the runway 16 overrun. The southern BAK-12 is
        located 1,668’ from the approach end of runway 34. The northern BAK-12 is located 2,450’ from
        the approach end of runway 16. The north E-5 is located 240’ into the runway 34 overrun.
     1.13.2. Tower will initiate standard emergency procedures when advised of an unplanned engage-
     ment or when an unplanned engagement occurs.
     1.13.3. Tower will notify AM Ops when a barrier re-configuration is required.
     1.13.4. AM Ops notifies Barrier Maintenance between 0730L-1630L Monday-Friday (the Fire
     Department at other times). When notified, Barrier Maintenance or Fire Department configures cables
     as required.
     1.13.5. 62 CES Operations Branch (Barrier Maintenance) is responsible for maintaining and perform-
     ing daily checks on arresting systems. They will notify AM Ops of the status of the systems after com-
     pleting the daily checks and after a runway change. AM Ops will notify Tower of any change in status
     and take necessary NOTAM action. Barrier Maintenance will notify the Airfield Manager of annual
     re-certification dates.
     1.13.6. The 62 OSS Airfield Operations Flight Commander ensures assigned controllers are trained
     and familiar with McChord's arresting systems before they are facility rated. Training is accomplished
     by Barrier Maintenance personnel in coordination with the Chief Controller.

                                               Chapter 2

          GROUND MOVEMENT AND DEPARTURE CLEARANCE PROCEDURES

2.1. Control of Ground Traffic.
   2.1.1. The Controlled Movement Area (CMA) is the portion of the movement area that requires
   Tower approval to access, specifically: the runway, overruns, and landing zone, up to the Instrument
   and or Visual Flight Rule (VFR) hold lines and within 100 feet of runway/overruns/landing zone edge
   (see Attachment 2 for airfield diagram). McChord Tower controls all vehicles/aircraft crossing or
   operating on the CMA and shares responsibility for the safety of personnel in these areas. Vehicles
   and pedestrians will not operate on any part of the CMA without direct two-way radio communica-
   tion, clearance, and approval from Tower. Aircraft or vehicle movement within the loading, mainte-
   nance, or parking areas is the responsibility of the pilot, aircraft/vehicle operator, or AM Ops. Tower
   Ground Control will advise aircraft taxiing from parking areas about other aircraft and vehicles on the
   movement area which may be a factor. Rules for vehicles operating on the airfield are contained in 62
   AWI 13-4. If radio communication with a vehicle or pedestrian on the aircraft movement area is lost,
   the control tower will flash the runway/taxiway lights. Vehicles or pedestrian will immediately depart
   the CMA. Vehicles and personnel must withdraw to a point no less than 100 feet from the edge of the
   runway, LZ, and overruns when directed by Tower to "exit the runway or taxiway."
      2.1.1.1. Fire Department and medical response vehicles responding to Tower’s primary crash
      alarm system activation are exempt from Tower approval to operate on taxiways, but must moni-
      tor the appropriate radio net. Tower will monitor the crash net until all emergency response vehi-
      cles have exited the movement area.
      2.1.1.2. Fire Department and medical response vehicles responding to airfield emergencies will
      notify Tower and AM Ops that they are responding.
      2.1.1.3. When security forces personnel or vehicles require access on the CMA, 62 SFS will con-
      tact Tower via the tower net for approval.
   2.1.2. Aircraft, vehicles, and pedestrians unable to comply with the requirements listed above may
   obtain individual clearance by prior coordination with AM Ops. AM Ops coordinates such requests
   with Tower. As a minimum, vehicles operating on the runway are escorted by trained personnel who
   are in continuous radio contact with the Tower.
   2.1.3. Aircraft repositioning (including towing) on the airfield must have Tower clearance before
   moving and must remain in radio contact during movement. NOTE: When advised by Tower during
   periods of reduced visibility, where potential conflict between towing/taxiing aircraft cannot be dis-
   cerned from the Tower, crews will provide Tower with progressive movement information and turn on
   aircraft navigation lights when available. Tower provides advisories of known towing/taxiing con-
   flicts to crews and provides an alternate route.
   2.1.4. CMA incursions observed by Tower are reported to AM Ops via landline as soon as all poten-
   tial conflicts have been resolved. The Airfield Manager reports all movement area incursions to the
   Airfield Operations Flight (AOF) Commander.
      2.1.4.1. For runway intrusions that had an adverse impact on flight operations, an AF IMT 651,
      Hazardous Air Traffic Report, will be submitted to Wing Safety.
14                                                         MCCHORDAFBI13-2 9 SEPTEMBER 2008


        2.1.4.2. For specific incidents of runway intrusions and other CMA violations that did not impact
        aircraft operations, AF IMT 457, USAF Hazard Report, will be used and forwarded to Wing
        Safety, with an information copy to the Airfield Manager.

2.2. Precision Approach Critical Areas. The localizer and glideslope critical areas for runway 16/34,
and the CAT II touchdown area for runway 34 are depicted in Attachment 2. These areas will be pro-
tected IAW FAA and AF directives any time precision instrument approaches are in progress. The local-
izer and glideslope critical areas for runway 34 conform to FAA criteria; the runway 34 CAT II
touchdown area conforms to AF criteria. The localizer and glideslope critical areas for runway 16 con-
form solely to AF criteria. Vehicles will not enter the ILS Critical Areas without Tower approval IAW 62
AWI 13-4.
     2.2.1. Vehicle/Aircraft operations in or through the ILS critical areas are subject to the following con-
     ditions: (Attachment 2.)
        2.2.1.1. Localizer Critical Area for Runway 16: When weather conditions are below an 800-foot
        ceiling or 2-miles visibility, do not authorize vehicle/aircraft operations in or over the critical area
        when an aircraft conducting an ILS approach is inside the Final Approach Fix (FAF).
        2.2.1.2. Glideslope Critical Area. When weather is below an 800-foot ceiling or 2-miles visibility,
        do not authorize aircraft larger than fighter type to operate beyond the instrument hold line (run-
        way 34) or to taxi/move beyond the instrument hold line on the east side of Bravo taxiway (run-
        way 16) when an aircraft conducting an ILS approach is inside the FAF.
        NOTE 1: Parking spot K-2 is located inside the runway 16 glideslope critical area. Use of K-2
        must be restricted when runway 16 is in use and can only be used if approved by the Airfield Man-
        ager or a higher authority.
        NOTE 2: Combat off-loads on Bravo East are conducted within the glideslope area.
        2.2.1.3. CAT II Touchdown Critical Area. When CAT II operations are in effect and the reported
        ceiling is less than 200 feet or the RVR is 2,000 or less, do not allow vehicles or aircraft to violate
        the touchdown critical area. Tower will instruct aircraft taxiing to RWY 34 via Echo Taxiway and
        aircraft taxiing from Bravo Taxiway east of the runway to “HOLD SHORT OF (runway) ILS
        CRITICAL AREA."

2.3. Ground Engine Runs.
     2.3.1. Maintenance engine runs will be conducted IAW 62 AWI 21-3, Ramp Operations Procedures.
     In addition to instructions outlined in that instruction, Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) will
     maintain a log of the aircraft tail number, location, estimated start time, duration, purpose and name of
     person providing the information for review by the 62 AW Commander and Public Affairs when
     needed.
     2.3.2. No engine runs above idle are authorized anywhere on the airfield between 2300L and 0500L ,
     without 62 MXG Commander and MOC coordination. This restriction is waived during exercise and
     contingency operations.
     2.3.3. Prior to engine runs, MOC will advise Tower of the aircraft tail number, location, number of
     engines to be run, and whether it is an idle or power run. Maintenance personnel must monitor ground
     control frequency during engine runs. NOTE: In the interest of safety or due to excessive noise,
MCCHORDAFBI13-2 9 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                           15


    Tower may instruct any aircraft running at power on any spot to return to idle immediately. A return
    to idle will be accomplished without delay. Tower can also terminate engine runs at any time. Mainte-
    nance will be advised when runs may be resumed.
    2.3.4. The following procedures are implemented between Tower and MOC to reduce engine noise in
    close proximity of the tower. These procedures are necessary for safe air traffic control operations and
    are in effect 24 hours a day. The MOC is responsible for ensuring that the following procedures are
    adhered to:
       2.3.4.1. D-25 is authorized for idle and below. Maximum power engine runs on parking spot D-26
       through D-31 are restricted as follows:
           2.3.4.1.1. For C-17A aircraft only:
               2.3.4.1.1.1. Maximum power engine runs on spots D-26 through D-29 are authorized.
               2.3.4.1.1.2. Maximum power engine runs on D-30 and D-31 are authorized, provided
               approval is granted by control tower watch supervisor and close coordination is main-
               tained with control tower prior to and during above idle runs. NOTE: Maximum power
               engine runs on D-31 are authorized, provided that a return to idle power is accomplished
               before aircraft taxiing on Hotel (north-south) are affected.
    2.3.5. Maximum power engine runs on parking spots B-6 and B-8 are authorized, provided:
       2.3.5.1. Approval is granted by the tower watch supervisor and close coordination is maintained
       with Tower prior to and during above idle runs.
       2.3.5.2. A return to idle is accomplished if there are aircraft taxiing on Hotel (north-south) that are
       affected.
    2.3.6. Maximum power engine runs on parking spots J-15, J-12, J-9, and J-6 are authorized provided:
       2.3.6.1. Approval is granted by the tower watch supervisor and close coordination is maintained
       with Tower prior to and during above idle runs.
       2.3.6.2. A return to idle is accomplished if there are aircraft taxiing on Hotel (north-south) that are
       affected.

2.4. Local Aircraft Radio Channelization. Pilots and ATC may substitute and use radio channels for
radio frequencies. The channels and frequencies listed below may be used in radio communications with
62 AW aircraft:


CH      FREQ       AGENCIES                            CH      FREQ         AGENCIES

2.5. Departure Clearances/Procedures.
16                                                        MCCHORDAFBI13-2 9 SEPTEMBER 2008


     2.5.1. All aircrew shall have an IFR/VFR flight plan on file with AM Ops prior to engine start
     requests. If expected departure is more than 30 minutes prior to filed departure time, pilots should
     advise Ground Control on initial contact of the new departure time (this will facilitate update of the
     ATC computer system). NOTE: If expected departure is more than 90 minutes after the filed depar-
     ture time, pilots should advise Ground Control as soon as possible. This will allow ATC to keep the
     flight plan open.
     2.5.2. Aircrews shall notify Pilot to Dispatch (PTD) anytime they plan on delaying in the local IFR/
     VFR pattern on a separate clearance (i.e., TCM…SPAAN…TCM) prior to departing on their previ-
     ously filed IFR flight plan.
     2.5.3. Pilots requesting opposite direction departures will notify Ground Control of the request on ini-
     tial contact (aircrews should expect delays or non-approval). NOTE: Due to rapidly changing air traf-
     fic situations, Tower will coordinate opposite direction IFR departures no earlier than 10 minutes prior
     to departure time.
     2.5.4. At ATC or pilot request, aircraft may make intersection takeoffs (see Attachment 2 for feet
     available). Exception: Aircraft will not takeoff to the north from the taxiway B intersection.
     2.5.5. IFR departure procedures.
        2.5.5.1. Aircraft departing McChord IFR into the National Airspace System (NAS) can expect
        one of three departure procedures: the Olympic-X, Alder-X or Puget-X. These departure proce-
        dures are located in the Low Altitude DOD Flight Information Publication, Vol 1. Aircraft depart-
        ing south, southeast or westbound may file for the Alder-X departure procedure. McChord Tower
        will issue the appropriate departure procedure as shown on the flight plan (Olympic-X departure,
        if a procedure was not filed). Tower will issue an initial altitude IAW Seattle TRACON-TCM let-
        ter of agreement. In the event of a VORTAC/VOR/TACAN outage, aircrews can expect radar vec-
        tors from Seattle TRACON.
        2.5.5.2. Aircraft departing IFR into the local radar pattern for multiple approaches will be issued
        the Puget-Four departure and an initial altitude of 3,000’.
     2.5.6. Active Air Scramble Procedures. Active Air Scramble procedures are executed in accordance
     with the standing letter of agreement between Western Air Defense Sector, Seattle TRACON,
     McChord ATC Tower, and Det 1, 194th Regional Support Wing (ANG).

2.6. Heavy Aircraft Taxiway/Parking Restrictions.
     2.6.1. Taxiways.
        2.6.1.1. Taxiways A, B, C, E, and J are available for use by all aircraft. Due to the potential FOD
        Hazard, C-5 and 747/E-4 aircraft may use taxiway D only if absolutely necessary.
        2.6.1.2. Taxiway F is used only during daytime/VFR conditions unless portable taxiway lights are
        installed and at the lowest possible aircraft gross weights. (C-130 limit: 165,000 lbs.) Questions
        concerning other aircraft types are referred to AM Ops (DSN 382-5611 / Commercial
        253-982-5611).
        2.6.1.3. Heavy aircraft shall be restricted from utilizing taxiway Hotel south of taxiway Delta
        when the RCR on Hotel is reported as 4 or less.
     2.6.2. Ramps.
MCCHORDAFBI13-2 9 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                        17


      2.6.2.1. B ramp and K parking spots are available for C-5 and 747/E-4 operations. NOTE: D and
      J ramps may be used with Airfield Management approval.
      2.6.2.2. Aircraft Parking. Heavy aircraft parking procedures shall be IAW 62 AWI 21-3. Aircraft
      parked on K-2 are positioned with the nose wheel on the parking spot and the front of the aircraft
      pointed toward the runway. NOTE: Parking spot K-2 is located inside the runway 16 glideslope
      critical area. Use of K-2 shall be restricted when runway 16 is in use and can only be used if
      approved by the Airfield Manager or a higher authority.

2.7. Armed Ordnance Ground Procedures. Any aircraft with an armed gun or live missiles is consid-
ered HOT loaded.
   2.7.1. Tower and pilots are not restricted from taxiing aircraft in front of HOT loaded aircraft holding
   short of the runway.
   2.7.2. Pilots will notify Tower anytime actual arming/de-arming is taking place. Tower will restrict
   aircraft from taxiing directly in front of the aircraft being armed/de-armed.
   2.7.3. Flight lead will notify Tower when the flight/aircraft begins arming/de-arming and when the
   procedure is complete.
   2.7.4. Notification is not required for arming/de-arming on the south hammerhead as long as aircraft
   are being armed/de-armed in the south arming area, heading southeast. (See Attachment 2 for arming
   areas/parking spot.)

2.8. Engine Running Crew Change (ERCC) Locations.
   2.8.1. Primary: Inbound aircraft will taxi to Charlie Ramp ERCC #2 (single ship). Formation aircraft
   will taxi to Charlie Ramp ERCC #1, #2, #3 (as required). Aircrews will taxi via the concrete taxilane
   to the ERCC locations (middle portion of Charlie Ramp is not stressed for C-17 operations). Out-
   bound aircrews will taxi to the active runway via taxiway Juliet (taxiway Kilo taxi operations require
   62 OG/CC approval and will not normally be approved).
   2.8.2. Secondary: As directed by Command Post.

2.9. Chaff/Flare Aircraft Parking. IAW AFMAN 91-201, Explosive Safety Standards, aircraft config-
ured with Aerial Defense Systems can be parked on any aircraft parking spot.

                                       AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL

3.1. Local Flying Area. The following local flying area is established to facilitate required activities
(Attachment 4).
     3.1.1. Local flying area - area enclosed with the following boundaries:
        3.1.1.1. North boundary - United States/Canadian border.
        3.1.1.2. East boundary - 115 degrees W. longitude.
        3.1.1.3. South boundary - 42 degrees N. latitude.
        3.1.1.4. West boundary - Pacific Air Defense Information Zone (ADIZ).
     3.1.2. Aerobatic area - area enclosed within the following boundaries:
        3.1.2.1. North boundary - 48 degrees 00' N. latitude.
        3.1.2.2. East boundary - 123 degrees 45' W. longitude.
        3.1.2.3. South boundary - 47 degrees 08' N. latitude.
        3.1.2.4. West boundary - Pacific Ocean shoreline.

3.2. Functional Check Flight Route. The functional check flight route should be filed as a
point-to-point flight plan on a DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan.

3.3. Operations within Class Delta Airspace. Aircraft in the Class D Airspace will monitor Tower fre-
quency except when under the control of Seattle Approach Control.

3.4. Civil Aircraft Use.
     3.4.1. Civil aircraft are not permitted to land at McChord AFB except as permitted by AFI 10-1001,
     Civil Aircraft Landing Permits, and AFI 10-1002, Agreements for Civil Aircraft Use of Air Force Air-
     fields. For civil aircraft landings, a DD Form 2401 Civil Aircraft Landing Permit must be executed
     and on file in AM Ops, or the pilot must have declared an in-flight emergency.
     3.4.2. Civil aircraft may make practice instrument approaches providing traffic density permits.
     These approaches must not degrade mission or training requirements of military aircraft. Practice
     approaches are low approaches only unless specifically approved in writing.

3.5. VFR Traffic Patterns.
     3.5.1. Standard traffic patterns are left traffic for runway 16 and right traffic for runway 34 (East).
     Left traffic to runway 34, right traffic to runway 16 (West) may be conducted with ATC approval for
     traffic purposes or aircraft operational need. NOTE: Left traffic to runway 16 may turn crosswind
     upon reaching 1,000’ AGL and south of Spanaway Lake.
     3.5.2. Rectangular patterns are flown at 1,800 feet MSL with entry to the downwind at an angle of 45
     degrees or as directed by ATC. Downwind leg is flown over Pacific Avenue or as directed/approved
     by ATC. NOTE: Begin the base turn to runway 34 south of Spanaway Lake.
MCCHORDAFBI13-2 9 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                             19


   3.5.3. Overhead pattern is flown at 2,300 feet MSL (aircraft may not fly the overhead pattern at 1,800
   feet MSL due to noise abatement). Approach control shall vector aircraft no closer than 6 mile initial.
   Tower will instruct VFR aircraft where to report initial. NOTE: If traffic dictates, Tower may instruct
   aircraft to “Re-enter initial.”
       3.5.3.1. Initial Re-Entry will be flown on a 3-5 mile arc to the east of the runway. Tower will
       instruct aircraft where to report initial, normally 3-5 mile initial (traffic conditions may dictate that
       aircraft extend initial beyond 5 miles).
       3.5.3.2. “Tactical Initial” is not authorized at McChord.
   3.5.4. Closed Traffic patterns are flown at 2,300 feet MSL for fighter type aircraft and 1,800 feet MSL
   for all other aircraft.
       3.5.4.1. Begin the turn to crosswind after passing departure end of the runway.
       3.5.4.2. When the Tower states, "closed traffic approved," it means fly the local procedures and
       execute closed traffic. If the Tower wants an aircraft to turn crosswind prior to departure end,
       Tower will state: "present position closed traffic approved." NOTE: The pilot is still authorized to
       execute a normal crosswind turn, and, if unable to execute an early crosswind turn, will advise
       Tower.
       3.5.4.3. Runway 16: Aircraft delaying the turn to crosswind more than 1 NM south of the field
       boundary, should be alert to the Spanaway Airport traffic area. Spanaway Airport’s delegated air-
       space is up to and including 1000’ MSL to the southeast. Aircraft operating in this area are not
       required to maintain radio communication with McChord Tower.
   3.5.5. Patterns must avoid Restricted Area R6703, located approximately 7 nautical miles (NM)
   southwest of McChord, unless authorized by Approach Control.

3.6. Weather Minimums for VFR Patterns.
   3.6.1. Ceiling shall be at least 500’ above the appropriate pattern altitude.
   3.6.2. Ground visibility shall be at least 3 SM.
   3.6.3. Anytime weather conditions limit a controller's ability to maintain visual contact with an air-
   craft, the watch supervisor will close the appropriate pattern regardless of the reported weather until
   he/she feels the weather condition causing the sight limitation is no longer a factor.

3.7. Radar Traffic Patterns. Seattle Approach Control has control over McChord’s Radar Traffic Pat-
tern. Patterns will be flown east of the runway at 3,000’ MSL. Seattle Approach will determine the length
of each leg of the pattern on a real-time basis.

3.8. Protection of 360 Overhead. During VFR conditions, aircraft making normal takeoffs, low
approaches, touch-and-go landings, stop-and-go landings, or missed approaches will not climb above
1,800 feet MSL until the departure end of the runway. When the 360 overhead pattern is in use, Tower
shall issue the following to all IFR departing aircraft: “(ACID) on departure maintain at or below 1,800
feet until the departure end of the runway, overhead in use.” The 1,800-foot MSL restriction provides 500
feet separation from the 360 overhead traffic pattern.
20                                                         MCCHORDAFBI13-2 9 SEPTEMBER 2008


3.9. Departure Priorities. Tower and Approach Control may delay, vector, hold, or breakout local traffic
and any traffic making a practice approach to facilitate "ACTIVE AIR DEFENSE MISSION/SCRAM-
BLE," “PRIORITY” and “TIME CRITICAL” departures. IAW FAAO 7110.65, departure time is consid-
ered the time the aircraft becomes airborne. NOTE: Aircraft in distress have the right of way over all
other aircraft.
     3.9.1. In addition to priorities in FAA Order 7110.65, Air Traffic Control, and AFJI 11-204, Opera-
     tional Procedures for Aircraft Carrying Hazardous Materials, priorities for departures are:
        3.9.1.1. First priority is an Active Air Defense Mission/Scramble.
        3.9.1.2. Second priority is an air evacuation aircraft requesting priority.
        3.9.1.3. Third priority is AMC-scheduled time critical missions. When required, the CP will con-
        tact Tower and advise, “(Call-sign) is TIME CRITICAL at (time).” Aircrews should be prepared
        to takeoff on either runway. Crews may request an opposite direction departure if insufficient time
        exists to taxi to the primary runway. Tower will coordinate with Approach Control as necessary.
        Time critical departures are considered on time when the aircraft departs not later than 2 minutes
        after the declared “TIME CRITICAL” time. NOTE: If pilots insist on an opposite direction depar-
        ture, additional delays may be incurred due to traffic. Based on current traffic in the local pattern
        and traffic controlled by Approach Control, departing from the runway in use might be more expe-
        ditious.
        3.9.1.4. Fourth priority is Priority Departures. Priority departures are normally given to airdrop
        and air refueling missions whose delay could affect mission accomplishment. To initiate this pri-
        ority, pilots will request “PRIORITY DEPARTURE” with a specific departure time when placing
        clearance on request. If there is an anticipated delay, Tower will coordinate with Approach Control
        to ensure departure as close to the priority time as possible. If the reason for requiring a priority
        takeoff becomes invalid, the pilot will cancel the priority request. Priority departures are consid-
        ered on time when the aircraft departs at the declared “PRIORITY DEPARTURE” time.
        NOTE 1: Tower will make every effort to facilitate on-time departures based on traffic (current
        and expected), runway in use, and IAW all current AF and FAA directives. Aircrews should make
        every effort to keep Tower informed of changes, delays, etc., at the earliest possible opportunity.
        NOTE 2: CP will advise Tower which AMC aircraft has precedence if a conflict arises between
        two or more time critical or priority mission departures.
        3.9.1.5. Fifth priority is a Distinguished Visitor (DV) aircraft.
            3.9.1.5.1. AM Ops will notify Tower of all known aircraft requiring DV handling.
            3.9.1.5.2. Tower will notify CP when arriving DV aircraft are 10 miles from the runway.
        3.9.1.6. Sixth priority is Practice Air Defense Mission/Scramble.
        3.9.1.7. Seventh priority is C-17A demonstration flights.
     3.9.2. To expedite traffic flow, Tower may ask aircraft awaiting departure if they can expedite takeoff.
     This means aircraft, other than heavy jets, will move from position on the taxiway/run-up area onto
     the runway and start takeoff roll without stopping. A clearance to expedite takeoff for a heavy jet indi-
     cates the aircraft will move from its position on the taxiway/run-up area onto the runway, STOP, and
     then begin takeoff roll as soon as possible. ATC cannot issue a clearance that implies or indicates
MCCHORDAFBI13-2 9 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                       21


   approval of rolling takeoffs by heavy aircraft. Any aircraft unable to comply with the ATC request will
   respond with, “Unable to expedite takeoff.”
   3.9.3. Inquiries pertaining to alleged ATC delays are immediately addressed to the Airfield Opera-
   tions Flight Commander or Chief Controller who will investigate and determine if the air traffic sys-
   tem caused the delay.

3.10. Formation Flights. Formation takeoffs and landings are authorized and are governed by aircraft
operating procedures and command directives.
   3.10.1. Two aircraft constitute a nonstandard formation for locally based C-17A aircraft. Lead pilots
   will inform the Tower of any exceptions.
   3.10.2. Tower shall instruct the last aircraft in a nonstandard formation flight to squawk 1100.

3.11. Opposite-Direction Traffic. McChord Tower or Seattle Approach Control will approve/disap-
prove opposite-direction operations based on existing/proposed traffic, priority requirements, and noise
abatement concerns.
   3.11.1. Tower shall coordinate opposite-direction departures with Seattle Approach Control no earlier
   than 10 minutes prior to departure.
       3.11.1.1. Unless otherwise coordinated, Tower shall not clear an opposite-direction departure for
       takeoff after an arrival is 10 miles on final approach or VFR departure downwind.
       3.11.1.2. Unless otherwise coordinated, Tower shall not clear a departure for takeoff after an
       opposite-direction arrival is 10 miles on final approach or VFR midfield downwind.
   3.11.2. Approach Control shall coordinate opposite-direction arrival approaches with Tower as
   needed.
       3.11.2.1. Approach Control shall not allow an opposite-direction arrival to proceed closer than the
       Final Approach Fix (FAF) until an arrival to the runway in use has landed or turned to a heading
       to avoid conflict.
       3.11.2.2. Approach Control shall not allow an arrival to proceed closer than the FAF until an
       opposite-direction arrival has landed or turned to a heading to avoid conflict.

3.12. Restricted Low Approaches. When personnel or equipment are on or operating within 100 feet of
the runway, tower may authorize restricted low approaches at or above 900 feet MSL (500 feet AGL) to
include locally assigned heavy aircraft. Transient heavy aircraft will be assigned 1,400 feet MSL (1,000
feet AGL).

3.13. Standard Go-Around/Missed Approach Procedures. In the event an aircraft has to execute an
unplanned go-around/missed approach, Tower shall issue the following instructions:
   3.13.1. When the tower VFR traffic pattern is open, tower shall instruct aircraft to remain in the
   closed traffic pattern and issue appropriate direction of turns and altitude.
   3.13.2. When the tower VFR traffic pattern is closed, Tower shall issue the following clearance: "Fly
   runway heading, climb and maintain 2,000 feet. Contact departure on (frequency)." NOTE: Tower
22                                                         MCCHORDAFBI13-2 9 SEPTEMBER 2008


     will immediately inform approach control of all unplanned go-arounds/missed approaches to include
     instructions issued/pilot's intentions.

3.14. Circling Procedures.
     3.14.1. Circling approaches are available to runway 34. All circling approaches will be flown to the
     west of the runway. Runway 34 circle to 16 operations are authorized for operational necessity only
     and must terminate in a full-stop. NOTE: An "operational necessity" is based on aircraft emergencies,
     weather conditions, availability of NAVAIDS, etc. Aircrew training requirements do not qualify as an
     operational necessity.
     3.14.2. 360-degree circling maneuvers (i.e. approach to 34 circle to 34) are authorized on runway 34
     to the west only.
     3.14.3. Approach to 16, circle to 34 procedures will have ground track east of I-5 and south of High-
     way 512.
     3.14.4. Approach to 34, circle to 16 procedures will have ground track crossing over I-5 and Highway
     512.

3.15. Multiple Approach Procedures. Aircraft conducting multiple IFR approaches or requesting radar
service from the VFR closed traffic pattern shall be issued the following climb-out instructions: Puget
Four Departures; maintain three thousand. When necessary, alternate instructions may be issued after
coordination with approach control.

3.16. Noise Abatement. In the interest of community relations, the following procedures will apply.
     3.16.1. After takeoff, all aircraft will achieve the appropriate rate of climb, commensurate with safety,
     to assure minimum noise level over populated areas.
     3.16.2. When possible, pilots should avoid over-flight of the Brown’s Point and Downtown Tacoma
     areas. Our policy is to use runway 34 as the primary landing runway unless safety or operational
     requirements dictate otherwise. NOTE: When on radar vectors for a runway 16 approach, aircrews
     should query Seattle Approach Control about extended vectors that would impact Brown’s Point and
     Downtown Tacoma. Additionally, conditions permitting (i.e., good weather, experienced crew levels),
     aircrews should request "short vectors."
     3.16.3. During non-precision approaches to runway 16, do not descend to minimum descent altitude
     so early that prolonged use of high-power settings at low altitudes is used.
     3.16.4. Avoid over-flying the church located approximately 500 feet east of Pacific Avenue midfield
     downwind and Pacific Lutheran University.
     3.16.5. Avoid Eatonville and Swanson Field by 3 NM and 3,000 feet.
     3.16.6. Safety should never be compromised, but arrivals and departures should be planned with these
     noise-sensitive areas in mind.

3.17. Separation (VFR - VFR, VFR - IFR). Tower uses separation criteria IAW FAAO 7110.65 for all
aircraft.
MCCHORDAFBI13-2 9 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                          23


3.18. Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS). McChord tower controllers are authorized to use
minimum standards (para 3.18.8.) between McChord assigned aircraft. Minimum standards may also be
applied between McChord assigned aircraft and other aircraft assigned to AMC, ACC, AETC, ANG,
AFMC, AFRC, and AFSOC. Air traffic controllers must be able to see all aircraft involved and determine
distances by reference to suitable landmarks. If any doubt exists, tower controllers must revert to FAAO
7110.65 separation standards.
   3.18.1. Any aircrew or air traffic controller may refuse RSRS when safety of flight may be jeopar-
   dized. In these cases, apply appropriate separation standards published in FAAO 7110.65.
   3.18.2. Aircraft will not overfly aircraft on the runway. Responsibility for separation rests with the
   pilot. Controllers must provide appropriate traffic advisories to landing aircraft.
   3.18.3. Controllers will provide cautionary wake turbulence advisories when required IAW FAAO
   7110.65; however; pilots are responsible for wake turbulence separation when maintaining visual sep-
   aration or operating under VFR. When operating IFR or under ATC instructions, air traffic controllers
   must ensure standard wake turbulence separation exists.
   3.18.4. For fighter-type aircraft only: A low-approach following a full stop shall use the alternate side
   of the runway when passing the aircraft on landing roll. Aircraft will not over-fly aircraft on the run-
   way. Responsibility for separation rests with the pilot. Controllers will provide appropriate traffic
   advisories to aircraft involved.
   3.18.5. RSRS between standard formation aircraft full stops are authorized provided aircraft involved
   are the same type aircraft. Separation is measured between the trailing aircraft in the lead formation
   and the lead aircraft in the trailing formation.
   3.18.6. RSRS is not authorized:
       3.18.6.1. During any situation involving an emergency aircraft.
       3.18.6.2. During any situation where the lead aircraft is “cleared for the option” or “stop and go.”
       3.18.6.3. During any situation involving an aircraft “low approach” behind a “touch-and- go” air-
       craft.
       3.18.6.4. During any situation involving an aircraft “touch-and-go” behind a “full-stop.”
       3.18.6.5. Between sunset and sunrise (night).
       3.18.6.6. Anytime the runway surface condition is reported as wet, ice on runway, snow on run-
       way, or breaking action is reported as “fair, poor, or nil” by any aircraft or by airfield management.
       3.18.6.7. With aircraft assigned to MAJCOMs not designated in this instruction unless a letter of
       agreement (LOA) is signed between owning MAJCOM/DO and the AMC/A3.
   3.18.7. When applying RSRS standards, “same aircraft” means same airframe (i.e., H/C-17 behind H/
   C-17, F-15 behind F-15, T-38 behind T-38/AT-38, C-130 behind MC-130, etc.). All other fighter and
   trainer type operations mean not the same airframe (i.e., F-15 behind F-16, F-16 behind F-18, T-38
   behind T-37, etc.).
   3.18.8. RSRS Standards (NOTE: (*) standard separation will be applied IAW FAAO 7110.65.)

3.19. B-52 Aircraft Restrictions. Except in an emergency, B-52 aircraft are not permitted to land due to
a lack of outrigger clearance from the BAK-12 housings. B-52 low approaches are permitted. Tower will
ensure pilots are notified of the BAK-12 housing limitations prior to starting the approach.

3.20. Armed Ordnance Recovery Procedures. HOT loaded aircraft will recover via normal traffic
routes to the active runway. There are no restrictions placed on number of practice traffic patterns or
instrument approaches flown by armed aircraft.

3.21. Wind Variability.
     3.21.1. The 62 OG/CC has determined that controllers shall issue variable wind information IAW AFI
     13-203.
     3.21.2. Controllers will issue variable wind information when there are changes in wind direction of
     60 degrees or more when the wind speed is 6 knots or more.

3.22. Communications Outage Procedures. In the event of an aircraft or tower communications fail-
ure, procedures will be conducted IAW the Aeronautical Information Manual, FAAO 7110.65, and the
following procedures:
     3.22.1. If the tower has a complete communications failure, all aircraft will deconflict themselves and
     monitor the tower for light gun signals. Locally assigned aircraft will make full-stop landings. Tran-
     sient aircraft will depart the Class Delta airspace and contact Seattle Approach Control for clearance
     to an alternate location.
     3.22.2. If an aircraft loses communication with the tower, the aircraft will monitor the control tower
     for a light gun signal and expect to make a full-stop landing.
MCCHORDAFBI13-2 9 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                     25

4.3. Hot Brakes Procedures.
     4.3.1. Hot brakes emergency parking areas are the hammerheads on each end of the runway and as
     remote from other aircraft as possible.
MCCHORDAFBI13-2 9 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                        27


   4.3.2. Taxi to the hot brake area via a route requiring the least amount of taxiing.
   4.3.3. Non-essential personnel will remain at least 300 feet from the aircraft until approved by Fire
   Department personnel.
   4.3.4. Pilots will follow directions of Fire Department and Aircraft Maintenance personnel.

4.4. Hung Flare Procedures.
   4.4.1. When a hung flare condition is suspected in-flight, the aircrew will declare an in-flight emer-
   gency.
      4.4.1.1. Aircrews will avoid bringing the aircraft to a full stop anywhere on the ramp that might
      block the normal taxi flow. Lima pad will be used for parking if available.
      4.4.1.2. One crewmember will deplane to check for an actual hung flare.
      4.4.1.3. If a hung flare is detected, the crew will shut down and evacuate the aircraft.
      4.4.1.4. A 600-foot cordon will be established around the aircraft.
   4.4.2. If a hung flare is discovered during the ground inspection and an in-flight emergency was not
   previously declared, the crew will declare a ground emergency with Ground Control.
      4.4.2.1. The crew will shut down and evacuate the aircraft.
      4.4.2.2. A 600-foot cordon will be established around the aircraft.

4.5. Hung Ordnance Procedures.
   4.5.1. Runway 34 is the runway of choice.
   4.5.2. Airborne aircraft will request vectors for an approach which avoids populated areas to the max-
   imum extent possible.
   4.5.3. After landing, aircraft will make turns on the runway toward the east.
   4.5.4. Position the aircraft in the primary (parking spot F-40) or secondary hung ordnance area as
   directed by Tower or EOD on magnetic heading 145 degrees and follow directions of weapons per-
   sonnel.
   4.5.5. If an arresting cable engagement is required, EOD/weapons personnel will be available at the
   scene to "safe" the aircraft when approved by the Fire Department.
   4.5.6. Monitor Ground Control frequency while following the directions of EOD/weapons personnel.
   4.5.7. Keep Ground Control apprised of the situation.

4.6. Gun Malfunction Procedures.
   4.6.1. Landing Runway 34: Tower will direct aircraft to F-40 parked towards the gun berm or make a
   180-degree turn to the east and back taxi to the south de-arm area. If unable to back taxi, position the
   aircraft in the north de-arm area, pointing southeast, and await EOD/weapons personnel.
   4.6.2. Landing Runway 16: Proceed directly to F-40 parked towards the gun berm or to the end of the
   runway, face south and wait for EOD/weapons personnel.
28                                                         MCCHORDAFBI13-2 9 SEPTEMBER 2008


     4.6.3. Monitor Ground Control frequency while following the directions of EOD/weapons personnel.
     4.6.4. Keep Ground Control apprised of the situation.

4.7. Hydrazine Procedures. If an aircraft reports having activated its Emergency Power Unit (EPU)
in-flight, after landing Tower will instruct the pilot to taxi the aircraft to parking spot F-40 and advise the
pilot to position the aircraft with the EPU side of the fuselage downwind. NOTE: Some pilots may not
want to taxi with a hydrazine leak due to the possibility of contamination. Make every effort to direct
them to F-40 via the most direct route to avoid affecting additional areas.
     4.7.1. If spot F-40 is not available, the tower will coordinate with the fire department to park the air-
     craft as far away from other aircraft, structures, and personnel as possible.
     4.7.2. The fire department will escort the aircraft if necessary and Tower will provide progressive taxi
     instructions to aid the aircraft.
     4.7.3. The Incident Commander will notify Tower of all emergency terminations.
        4.7.3.1. Tower will notify AM Ops of ground/in-flight emergency termination times.
        4.7.3.2. Tower will notify Seattle Approach of all in-flight emergency termination times.

4.8. Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT)/Crash Position Indicator (CPI) Signals. All ELT/CPI
signals are considered an emergency until the source is located and proven otherwise. To preclude degra-
dation of the system, the following procedures are established: NOTE: The first 5 minutes of each hour
are designated for ELT testing, which is an alarm not exceeding three audio sweeps.
     4.8.1. When a signal is received and no supporting data is available:
        4.8.1.1. Tower will notify AM Ops.
        4.8.1.2. AM Ops notifies Life Support and MOC.
        4.8.1.3. MOC determines the source of the signal and silences the active locator beacon. If unable
        to locate the beacon on McChord, MOC notifies AM Ops and provides known data, i.e., fre-
        quency, signal strength, bearing from McChord, etc.
        4.8.1.4. AM Ops passes the data to Tower.
        4.8.1.5. Tower notifies Seattle Center Watch Supervisor with all known ELT/CPI data via the
        “FLOW” dial line 03.
        4.8.1.6. Tower notifies AM Ops and Seattle Center Watch Supervisor of all emergency and ELT/
        CPI terminations.

4.9. Fuel Tank, Ordnance, Cargo Jettison and Fuel Dumping (Attachment 5). A                   portion   of
Restricted Area R6703 is established as the jettison area for external fuel tanks and conventional ord-
nance. The area is approximately 195 degrees/10 DME from the McChord VORTAC. However, the des-
ignated impact area is relatively small (4-3/4 by 2-3/8 miles) and the drop should be made as accurately as
possible. NOTE: Anyone having knowledge of a planned fuel tank, ordnance, cargo jettison will contact
the Range Control Officer (RCO) at Fort Lewis (253-967-6371 or on VHF 141.125) as soon as possible
with the pertinent details. The RCO, in turn, will ensure the restricted/jettison areas are sterilized.
MCCHORDAFBI13-2 9 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                            29


   4.9.1. Approach Control will notify Fort Lewis Range Control when an emergency drop is contem-
   plated. Approach Control may be contacted for vectors to the emergency drop when an aircraft is
   unable to proceed VFR or upon request.
   4.9.2. Aircraft will approach the jettison area at 2,000 feet MSL on a southwesterly heading (see
   Attachment 4). An alternate jettison area for cargo, fuel tanks, and ordnance is the Pacific Ocean
   while the aircraft is under the control of Seattle Center. An aircraft requiring internal fuel jettison nor-
   mally is vectored to an over-water area. Fuel may be released anytime above 5,000 feet AGL. Pilots
   will notify the appropriate ATC facility prior to fuel release.
   4.9.3. McChord does not have a designated fuel dumping area. When fuel dumping is required, Seat-
   tle Approach or Seattle Center will designate a location.

4.10. Controlled Bailouts.
   4.10.1. The controlled bailout area is the landing zone at the McChord 150/08 mile fix. Aircraft
   should approach the controlled bailout area at 2,500 feet MSL (fighters use 5,000 feet MSL) heading
   270 degrees. This should cause the aircraft to impact within Restricted Area R6703.
   4.10.2. During communications failure, pilots should set transponders to code 7700, fly to the
   McChord TACAN, and proceed outbound on the 150-degree radial at 2,500 feet MSL (fighters use
   5,000 feet). When over the 8 DME fix, turn to heading 270 degrees and bailout.
   4.10.3. Anyone having knowledge of a planned bailout will contact the Range Control Officer (RCO)
   at Fort Lewis (253-967-6371 or on VHF 141.125) as soon as possible with the pertinent details. The
   RCO in turn will ensure the restricted/controlled bailout areas are sterilized.

4.11. Anti-Hijacking Procedures. Anti-Hijack procedures are outlined in FAAO 7110.65, Air Traffic
Control, AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (FOUO), and JO 7610.4M, Special Oper-
ations.
   4.11.1. CP will notify Tower and AM Ops to initiate anti-hijack procedures if the situation has not
   already been identified by Tower or other agencies.
   4.11.2. Tower will:
       4.11.2.1. Monitor ground activities. Ensure all engine starts, taxi, towing, and takeoff information
       is received through the authorized agency (AM Ops, MOC, or CP). The daily flying schedule is
       published by CP and may be used to identify authorized engine starts. Flying schedule must be
       obtained via a verified source.
       4.11.2.2. Obtain and document parking location on all engine running aircraft, and the origin and
       destination of all aircraft in tow.
       4.11.2.3. Activate the PCAS when an actual or suspected unauthorized aircraft movement is
       noticed or reported.
       4.11.2.4. Suspend airfield operations as required, and notify other affected aircraft of temporary
       landing or taxi restrictions.
       4.11.2.5. Authorize responding vehicles to aircraft location via the most direct or requested route.
       Provides progressive movement/interception directions if necessary.

     4.11.2.6. Respond to the requests of the Incident Commander when command is established.
     Requests may include changes to airfield lighting, NAVAIDS, or other equipment and services
     required to stop unauthorized aircraft movement.
     4.11.2.7. Notify AM Ops and CP of termination time.

                                      SPECIAL PROCEDURES

5.1. C-130 Landing Zone (LZ) Operations.
   5.1.1. Circling approaches to the LZ are not authorized. C-130 aircraft making an instrument/visual
   approach to the runway can transition to the LZ if the following conditions are met:
      5.1.1.1. Weather is at or above 1,000’ ceiling and 3 miles visibility.
      5.1.1.2. The aircraft requests the transition and reports the LZ in sight.
      5.1.1.3. Tower approves the transition to the LZ.
      5.1.1.4. Aircraft requesting a transition to the LZ from an instrument approach are transitioning
      from IFR to VFR operations.
   5.1.2. Aircraft taxiing out for departure must hold short of the north run-up pad and taxiways B, C,
   and D west of the runway during all LZ operations. NOTE: All turnoffs from the LZ are toward taxi-
   way H unless otherwise directed/authorized by ATC.
   5.1.3. Transmissions to and from aircraft will include the phrase "LZ North (runway 34) or South
   (runway 16)." (Example: "Wind Three Four Zero at One Zero LZ North Cleared to Land" or “Report
   Left Base LZ South.”)
   5.1.4. Separation Criteria (Departures): Departures from the main runway are not authorized when
   aircraft are on the LZ. Departures from the LZ are not authorized when an aircraft is on the runway
   north of Delta taxiway.
   5.1.5. Separation Criteria (Arrival):
      5.1.5.1. LZ-North Arrival preceded by a Runway 34/LZ North Arrival. Preceding arriving traffic
      must be clear of the runway/LZ and established west of the VFR hold line or prior to the LZ air-
      craft crossing the LZ landing threshold.
      5.1.5.2. Runway 34 Landing preceded by a LZ-North Landing. The LZ traffic must be clear of the
      LZ and headed toward taxiway H prior to the runway 34 landing traffic crosses the runway land-
      ing threshold.
      5.1.5.3. LZ-South Landing preceded by a Runway 16/LZ Landing. Runway 16 traffic west of the
      VFR hold line or on the runway south of Delta taxiway prior the LZ traffic crossing the LZ land-
      ing threshold.
      5.1.5.4. Runway 16 Landing preceded by a LZ-South Landing. The LZ traffic must be clear of the
      LZ and headed toward taxiway H before landing traffic crosses the runway 16 landing threshold.

5.2. Combat Offload Operations.
     5.2.1. Charlie Taxiway, east of the runway, is the primary combat offload area. Aircraft will taxi to
     Delta Taxiway, east of the runway, and then turn left onto Charlie Taxiway. Aircrew will initiate the
     combat offload at the intersection of Charlie and Delta and taxi northwest along Charlie Taxiway.
     Bravo Taxiway, east of the runway, is the alternate combat offload location. Aircraft will taxi to the
     eastern most portion of the taxiway and execute a right 180° turn. The aircrew will initiate the combat
     offload operation at the intersection of Bravo and Foxtrot and taxi southwest along Taxiway Bravo.
     5.2.2. The following conditions preclude use of Bravo Taxiway:
        5.2.2.1. When the reported ceiling is less than 800 feet and/or the visibility less than 2 miles and
        an aircraft is cleared for an ILS approach to runway 16. NOTE 1: Aircraft on Bravo east must be
        east of the instrument hold line once an aircraft is inside the Final Approach Fix to runway 16 and
        the weather is less than 800/2. NOTE 2: Due to erroneous Glide Slope readings with aircraft oper-
        ating on Bravo East, tower will notify aircraft inbound on ILS final of any aircraft within the com-
        bat offload area regardless of weather conditions.
        5.2.2.2. When any aircraft are parked on Kilo 2.
     5.2.3. Condition precluding use of Charlie Taxiway: Any aircraft parked on Foxtrot 40.
     5.2.4. Procedures for a combat offload:
        5.2.4.1. Aircraft will:
            5.2.4.1.1. Obtain taxi clearance to the selected combat offload location from Ground Control.
            5.2.4.1.2. Obtain clearance to begin combat offload operation from Ground Control.
            5.2.4.1.3. Advise Ground Control when combat offload operation is complete.
            5.2.4.1.4. Hold short of the runway until cleared to cross by Ground Control.
        5.2.4.2. Tower will:
            5.2.4.2.1. Approve/disapprove the commencement of the combat offload operation based on
            traffic/weather conditions.
            5.2.4.2.2. When a combat offload operation is approved, departures will not be permitted and
            landing aircraft will not be allowed closer than landing threshold.
            5.2.4.2.3. Upon receiving notification of combat offload termination, normal operations may
            resume.
            5.2.4.2.4. Restricted low approaches may be approved during the combat offload operation.
            5.2.4.2.5. Notify AM Ops when combat offloads are complete if aircraft dropped a pallet.
        5.2.4.3. AM Ops will:
            5.2.4.3.1. Accomplish FOD check after the operation has terminated if a pallet was dropped.
            5.2.4.3.2. Ensure that all maintenance equipment is secured or moved off parking spots F1
            and F2.
MCCHORDAFBI13-2 9 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                          33


5.3. Night Vision Device (NVD) Operations. IAW AFI 13-203, Air Traffic Control, non-participating
aircraft will not mix with participating NVD aircraft in any traffic pattern or on any controlled movement
area. EXCEPTION: Aircraft not performing NVD operations may mix with NVD aircraft provided they
are in compliance with the procedures outlined in this instruction and 62 OGI 11-1/11-1A.
   5.3.1. Scheduling procedures. Units requesting NVD operations must coordinate with 62 OSS/OSK,
   Combat Tactics Flight (DSN 382-3614) and 62 OSS/OSO, Current Operations Flight (DSN
   382-9920) at least 24 hours prior to operations. 62 OSS/OSO will schedule all NVD operations on the
   Wing Daily Flying Schedule using GDSS2. The schedule will be posted NLT 1700L the day prior to
   execution. Specific times for airspace and runway use will be annotated and deconflicted using the Air
   Movement Table. NVD training will normally not be scheduled past 2300L due to quiet hours.
   62 OSS/OSO will coordinate with 62 OG/CC for a quiet hour waiver and 62 OSS/OSA to ensure ade-
   quate ATC manning for any NVD training scheduled past 2300L. In the event that two transient air-
   craft, one participating and one non-participating, are attempting to fly local patterns, priority will be
   given to any aircraft with a PPR. If neither aircraft has a PPR, then priority will be on a first-come,
   first-serve basis.
   5.3.2. Notification/coordination requirements. Any base assigned aircraft not scheduled for NVD
   operations may request the procedure with McChord tower. Tower will approve operation on a
   first-come, first-serve basis, workload permitting. Unscheduled aircraft will be the first to terminate
   procedures should it become necessary. 62 AW Command Post (CP) will provide priority guidance if
   scheduling conflicts arise. If a scheduling conflict arises, pilots are expected to deconflict with 62 AW
   Command Post. Transient aircraft must be briefed by 62 OSS/OSK on procedures outlined in this
   instruction and 62 OGI 11-1/11-1A, and scheduled before they are authorized to mix the pattern with
   participating aircraft.
       5.3.2.1. Tower will: Include an advisory on the ATIS broadcast at least 30 minutes prior to, or as
       soon as practical thereafter, of NVD operations commencing and continuing through the duration
       of operations. “NVD OPERATIONS IN EFFECT AT MCCHORD AFB UNTIL XXXXZ. ALL
       NON-PARTICIPATING AIRCRAFT CONTACT GROUND CONTROL 10 MINUTES PRIOR TO
       DEPARTURE OR PATTERN ENTRY FOR COORDINATION.”
       5.3.2.2. If the ATIS is out of service Tower will: Broadcast NVD operations commencement on
       Local and Ground Control frequencies 30 minutes prior to NVD operations or as soon as practical
       thereafter. “NVD OPERATIONS AT MCCHORD AFB (WILL BEGIN AT XXXXZ).”
   5.3.3. Weather requirements. Minimum weather requirements at McChord AFB will be 2000’ AGL
   ceiling and 3 miles visibility for the rectangular pattern and 2500’ AGL ceiling and 3 miles visibility
   for the overhead pattern. Aircrews may fly IFR instrument approaches that transition to NVD landings
   provided they comply with proficiency and weather minimums IAW 11-2C17 Vol. 3.
   5.3.4. NVD aircraft taxi routes and NVD traffic pattern. Non-participating aircraft will not be allowed
   to taxi until appropriate lighting is activated. All participating aircraft will advise ATC of intended
   NVD taxi route. Taxiway lights will remain on unless specifically requested by NVD aircrews. No
   restrictions apply once the airfield lighting is turned off and pilots accept risk associated with unlit
   taxiways. Standard VFR traffic patterns will be flown to all runways IAW this regulation and 11-2C17
   Vol. 3, Ch. 10, 62 AW SUP1. Aircraft making approaches are expected to remain within the Class D
   airspace unless coordinated with tower. If aircraft are unable to maintain required cloud clearance at
   1800’, the tower pattern will be closed and operations terminated.
34                                                          MCCHORDAFBI13-2 9 SEPTEMBER 2008


     5.3.5. Vehicle operations. Vehicle movement will be restricted in the vicinity of the runway during
     NVD operations. Vehicle movement on the rest of the airfield is unrestricted. No specific routing is
     necessary. Vehicle operations should be kept to a minimum during periods of reduced airfield lighting,
     although there is no requirement for vehicles to operate without normal vehicle lighting. Vehicles are
     required to meet requirements to maintain two-way radio communications with the control tower
     while operating within the controlled movement area.
     5.3.6. Traffic pattern/flow restrictions. Aircraft operating IAW with this instruction will be considered
     as “participating aircraft” for purposes of handling by tower. A participating aircraft is one that is uti-
     lizing an LZ either in the overt or covert configuration, using NVD to a blacked out runway, or an air-
     craft not on NVDs that has agreed to comply with this regulation. A non-participating aircraft is any
     aircraft either VFR or IFR requiring standard runway lighting that has not agreed to comply with
     NVD procedures. VFR transitions will be considered non-participating and will be provided standard
     separation (under normal circumstances VFR transitions will not prevent NVD operations).
        5.3.6.1. No more than three aircraft may operate within the Class Delta surface area when NVD
        procedures are in effect. The tower watch supervisor (WS) may reduce NVD operations to less
        than three if he/she deems it necessary.
        5.3.6.2. Aircrews will avoid all locally defined no-fly areas and noise abatement areas as defined
        in 62 AWI 13-2 when performing NVD operations at McChord AFB.
        5.3.6.3. Aircrews will operate within the pattern IAW AFI 11-2C-17 Vol 3 and this regulation.
        5.3.6.4. When commencing NVD operations within the lateral/vertical limits of Class D airspace,
        aircraft will remain in the Class D airspace unless otherwise authorized by tower. Class D exten-
        sions will be requested by aircrews in a timely manner for ATC coordination.
        5.3.6.5. Tower controllers will use the following phraseology when clearing participating aircraft
        for arrivals/departures. Example:


                     “ACID, RUNWAY 16 ASSAULT, CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF”
                     “ACID, RUNWAY 34, 500-FOOT NVG, CLEARED FOR THE OPTION”
                     “ACID, RUNWAY 16, 1000-FOOT NVG, CLEARED TO LAND”

        5.3.6.6. Aircrews phraseology:


                     “TOWER, ACID, REQUEST RUNWAY 16/34 ASSAULT”
                     “TOWER, ACID, REQUEST RUNWAY 16/34, 500-FOOT NVG”
                     “TOWER, ACID, REQUEST RUNWAY 16/34, 1000-FOOT NVG”

     5.3.7. NVD Operation Suspension, Termination and Resumption Procedures. NVD operations may
     be suspended for the following reasons: unsafe airfield condition, emergency response, in the opinion
     of the tower WS, or for a non-participating aircraft departure/arrival. The tower WS has the authority
     to suspend, terminate or resume operations at their discretion.
MCCHORDAFBI13-2 9 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                        35


     5.3.7.1. IAW FAAO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control, tower will resume NVD lighting when a depart-
     ing non-participating aircraft departs the Class Delta airspace. Tower will restore normal lighting
     for an arriving non-participating aircraft before an IFR aircraft begins final approach or a VFR air-
     craft enters the Class Delta airspace. Lights will remain on until the arrival is clear of the runway
     or, if taxiway lights are requested off, when the inbound aircraft has parked.
         5.3.7.1.1. Tower will use the following phraseology prior to terminating NVD operations:
         “ATTENTION (ALL ACFT) or (CALL SIGN), (LZ) / (NVD) OPERATIONS TERMINATED/
         SUSPENDED FOR (REASON).” May be followed by “SAY INTENTIONS.”
     5.3.7.2. Tower will advise aircraft of anticipated delay to NVD operations if known.
     5.3.7.3. Emergency knock-off/termination of NVD operations may be initiated by ATC or the air-
     crew at any time.
  5.3.8. Airfield Lighting Configuration. Airfield lighting during NVD operations will vary depending
  on NVD operation requested by the pilot. Airfield lighting is outlined in Attachment 8-Attachment
  11. Standard airfield lighting will be turned on for nonparticipating aircraft IAW FAAO 7110.65, Air
  Traffic Control. Air traffic controllers will notify participating NVD aircrews prior to turning on stan-
  dard airfield lighting.
     5.3.8.1. Runway. Airfield lighting on runway will be completely turned off (to include approach
     lighting, PAPIs, REILs, etc.). Non-participating aircraft and vehicles will not be allowed to enter
     the runway. Desired LZ lights will be turned on as requested by participating aircraft.
     5.3.8.2. Taxiways. All taxiway lighting will remain on. Upon request from aircrews, all taxiway
     lights, except for taxiways C and K, may be turned off if taxiways are not in use at time of request.
     5.3.8.3. Ramps. All ramp lighting will remain on.
     5.3.8.4. Rotating Beacon. The rotating beacon will remain on.
     5.3.8.5. Airfield Obstruction Lighting. Airfield obstruction lights will remain on.
     5.3.8.6. Restoring Airfield Lighting. Airfield lighting will be restored:
         5.3.8.6.1. At the termination of NVD operations.
         5.3.8.6.2. When required for emergency response.
         5.3.8.6.3. When required in the opinion of the tower WS.
         5.3.8.6.4. When required for a non-participating aircraft departure or arrival IAW the follow-
         ing guidelines:
         5.3.8.6.5. Restore taxiway lighting along the intended taxi route prior to a non-participating
         aircraft taxiing, if previously turned off.
         5.3.8.6.6. For arriving and departing non participating aircraft, tower will follow para 5.3.7.1.
  5.3.9. Aircraft lighting requirements. There are currently no exceptions to FAR 91.209 granted by the
  FAA allowing aircraft position/anti-collision lights out operations within any tower surface area air-
  space class within the U.S.
  5.3.10. Vehicle lighting requirements. Vehicles operating on the airfield must utilize proper lighting
  IAW 62 AWI 13-4, Flightline Driving. Vehicles operating lights-out during periods of reduced airfield
36                                                        MCCHORDAFBI13-2 9 SEPTEMBER 2008


     lighting must use hazard warning flashers so that tower/aircrew can see the vehicle. Mounted IR
     strobes are not authorized.

5.4. C-17A Aerial Demonstration Flights. Demonstration flights will be conducted in 6-, 10-, and
12-minute profiles at 1,500 feet AGL and below.
     5.4.1. Aircrews should coordinate with AM Ops at least 24 hours prior to demonstration flights for
     appropriate NOTAM notification.
     5.4.2. AM Ops will send appropriate NOTAM for the duration of the flight(s).
     5.4.3. Tower will:
        5.4.3.1. Notify Seattle Approach once a demonstration flight has taxied out for departure.
        5.4.3.2. Ensure all aircraft have exited and no other aircraft enter the Class D, once a demonstra-
        tion flight becomes airborne.
        5.4.3.3. Limit transmissions to the aircraft to the maximum extent possible once the flight
        becomes airborne.
        5.4.3.4. Disapprove all aircraft/vehicle requests to enter/cross the runway during the profile.
        5.4.3.5. Notify Seattle Approach and AM Ops when the demonstration flight is complete.

5.5. Tactical Ordnance Procedures. Transient aircraft may operate out of McChord AFB with live ord-
nance provided 30 days (preferable) but not less than 15 days prior notice is given to 62 AW/XPL, they
are compliant with parent command and AMC safety directives, and the following:
     5.5.1. Approved by the 62 AW Commander.
     5.5.2. Maximum number of aircraft involved must be provided during initial request. Any changes
     must again be coordinated with 62 AW Plans Office (XP) prior to arrival.

5.6. Unusual Maneuvers. Tower will not approve pilot requests to conduct unusual maneuvers within
the Class D airspace unless they are essential to flight performance (reference FAA Order 7110.65).

5.7. Request Procedures for Parachute Jumps/Airdrops onto McChord AFB.
     5.7.1. Units requesting parachute jumps or airdrops onto Farmer or Combat Control Team drop zones
     must send a written request to 62 OSS Current Operations (62 OSS/OSO) at least 5 days in advance,

Aircraft will be at airspeeds above 300KTS and operating VFR at low altitude. Controllers must be aware
the speed of aircraft inbound on VR331 will decrease normal space to sequence aircraft inside of them.
East Gate procedures provide additional traffic conflict for VR331 procedures. Although use of VR331 is
specifically addressed in the GRF/TCM LOA; controllers should be vigilant for traffic conflicts with East
Gate traffic from GRF.
