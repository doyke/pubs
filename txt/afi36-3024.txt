4. Policy. It is DoD policy to provide monthly transitional compensatio n payments and other benefits
described herein for dependents of members who are separated for dependent abuse.

5. Procedures:
   5.1. Recipients of Payments. Payments will be made to eligible dependents as follows:
       5.1.1. If the member wa s married when the of fense occurred, payment will be made to that
       spouse. The spouse will receive compensation for themselves and each dependent child in their
       custody . A spouse can receive the child portio n of the compensation even if the child resides
       away from the home (e.g., non-physical custody) as long as the spouse has legal custody.
       5.1.2. If the spouse is in eligible under paragraph 5.5. to receive payment be cause of remarriage,
       cohabitation, or active participation, payments will be made to each dependent child of the mem-
       ber not residing in the household of the member or the spouse.
       5.1.3. If there is no eligible spouse for reasons other than those listed in paragraph 5.1.2. (EXAM-
       PLE: The member had no dependent spouse or s pouse has died), payments will be made to the
       dependent children of the member who do not reside in the household of the member.
       5.1.4. Status as a “dependent child” is determined as of the date on which the member is convicted
       of the offense or as of the date of the member’s administrative separation, whichever is applicable.
       5.1.5. If recipients are incapa ble of handling their af fairs, payment may be made only to a
       court-appointed guardian. For a depende nt child under 18 years of age, payments will be made
       only to a court-appointed guardian or a natural parent (who is not a spouse of the member), if the
       natural parent has legal custody.
       5.1.6. Children residing away from an eligible spouse are not entitled to apply for compensation.
       (EXAMPLE: A dependent child moves out of the home of the eligible spouse and moves in with
       a grandparent. The child would not be able to apply for compensation in their own right.)
   5.2. Payment Commencement and Duration:
       5.2.1. Payment commences on the date: (1) the person acting under Title 10, U.S.C., Section
       860(c) approves the cour t-martial sentence for a dependent-abuse offense that includ es a d is-
       missal, dishonorable discharge, bad conduct discharge, or forfeiture of all pay and allowances; (2)
       the member ’s commander starts administrative separation action if the basis for separation
       includes a dependent-abuse of fense. This date will be the date used in Item 20 of the DD Form
       2698, Application for Transitional Compensation, and no payment will be made if the date is
       prior to 30 November 1993. See paragraph 9.3. for examples.
       5.2.2. The duration of payments will be 36 months except, if as of the starting date of payment,
       the unserved portion of the memb er’s obligated active du ty service is less than 36 months , the
       duration of payment will be the greater of the unserved portion or 12 months. See paragraph 9.3.

       and indemnity compensation under Title 38, U.S.C., Section 1311(a)(1). If the spouse has custody

       spouse will increase for each child by the amount ineffect under Title 38, U.S.C., Section 1311(b).
       If there is no eligible spouse, co mpensation paid to a dependent chil d or children will be paid in
       equal shares at the rate in effect under Title 38, U.S.C., Section 1313.
       5.3.2. Payments will be prorated for months when payments start or stop in the middle of a month.

       odd cent.
       5.3.4. Payments will stop ef fective the date of death of the re cipient and no remaining payments
       will be made.
    5.4. Cessation of Payments:
       5.4.1. Payment will stop effective the 1st day of the 1st month fo llowing the month in which the
       recipient is notified, in writing, that payment will cease for the following reasons:
           5.4.1.1. The member is sentenced by a court-martial to receive punishment that includes a dis-
           missal, dishonorable discharge, bad conduct discharge as a result of a conviction for a depen-
           dent-abuse offense or forfeiture of all pay and allowances and the punishment is remitted, set
           aside, or mitigated to a lesser punishment that does not include any such punishment.
           5.4.1.2. The administra tive separation of a member from ac tive duty is proposed on a bas is

           proved by competent authority.
           5.4.1.3. The recipient will not be required to repay transitional compensation received before
           the cessation effective date determined except as necess ary to recoup an y amount that was
           erroneous when paid.
    5.5. Forfeiture Provisions:
       5.5.1. Remarriage. If a spouse receiving payments remarries, payments terminate on the date of
       remarriage. Payments will not be restarted if the remarriage is terminated. If payments to the
       spouse terminate due to remarriage and there is a dependent child not living in the same household
       as the spouse or member, payments will be made to the dependent child.
       5.5.2. Cohabitation. If the member lives in the same house as the spouse or dependent child to
       whom compensation is pa yable under this instruction, payment will terminate on the date the
       member begins living in the household. Once te rminated, payments will not be resumed. Com-
       pensation paid before the member resides in the household will not be recouped.
       5.5.3. Active Participant. If the victim was a dependent ch ild and the Installation Commander
       finds the spouse actively participated in the con duct constituting the crimin al offense or actively
       aided or abetted the member in such conduct against the dependent child, the spouse, or dependent
       child living with the spouse, will not be paid transitional compensation.

8. Use this AFI in conjunction with DoDI 1342.24, Transitional Compensation for Abused Depen-
dents.

9. DD Form 2698 Clarification:
   9.1. Definition of Obligated Active Duty Service (OADS) (Item 19):
      9.1.1. For enlisted members: The time remaining on their term of enlistment (Item 19b, DD Form
      2698) (e.g., member enlisted or reenlisted last on 10 December 1995 for 4 years--OADS on Item
      19b, DD Form 2698, would be 9 December 1999).
      9.1.2. For officers: Indefinite (or none) unless there is a date of separation established; then it will
      be the time remaining until separation (Item 19c, DD Form 2698).
   9.2. Date of Approval of the Court-Martial Sentence or Administrative Separation (Item 20):
      9.2.1. Verify data with SJA.
      9.2.2. This is the date the convening authority approves the court-martial sentence that includes a
      dismissal, dishonorable discharge, bad conduct discharge or forfeiture of all pay and allowances;
      or the date the commander initiated the administrative discharge for a dependent-abuse offense.
   9.3. Payment Dates (Item 21):
      9.3.1. Step 1: The start date in Item 21a will be the same date used in Item 20.
      9.3.2. Step 2: Subtract the date in Item 19b or 19c from the date in Item 20. This will determine
      the number of months for the payment. If the num ber of months equals less than 12 months, use
      12 months. If the number of months equals 12 or more, use that number of months not to exceed
      36 months.
      9.3.3. Step 3: Add the number of months from S tep 2 to the start date used in Item 21a and this
      will be the date you use in Item 21b. EXAMPLE:
          9.3.3.1. The date in Items 19b or 19c is 3 January 1999.
          9.3.3.2. The date in Item 20 is 4 January 1997.
          9.3.3.3. Subtract (3 January 1999 - 4 January 1997). This equals to: 24 months.
          9.3.3.4. Add the 24 months to the date in Item 20 (4 January 1997 + 24 months). This equals
          to: 3 January 1999.
          9.3.3.5. In this example, the start date in Item 21a is 4 January 1997 and the stop date in Item
          21b is 3 January 1999).
   9.4. Non-Payment. No payment will be made if the date in Item 20 is before 30 November 1993. In
   the case when the convening authority approved th e court-martial sentence on a date prior to 30
   November 1993, but the execution of dischar ge was 30 November 1993 or after, use the later date in
   Item 20 (EXAMPLE: Convening authority a pproves court-martial se ntence on 25 August 1992, but
