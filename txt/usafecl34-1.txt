This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 34-1, The Air Force Services Combat
Support Program. The Inspection Checklist is developed to support Air Force Instruction (AFI) 90-201,
Inspector General Activities, and the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) supplement,
inspection programs. This checklist identifies compliance items that support guidance in the following:
law, executive order, higher headquarters publication (Department of Defense (DoD), Air Force Manual
(AFMAN), etc.) and major command (MAJCOM) publications. It applies to all USAFE Library
Services. It does not apply to Air National Guard (ANG) or US Air Force Reserve (AFRC) units. Units
can supplement this publication to add internal compliance items.             Ensure that any local
policy/guidance, publications, instructions or supplements are created in accordance with Air Force
Instruction (AFI) 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, and the USAFE supplement. This
checklist is intended for inspection use. Send comments and suggested improvements to this publication
on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, to USAFE Command Librarian (HQ
USAFE/A1KEL), Unit 3050 Box 30, APO AE 09094-5010. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition
Schedule (RDS) located in Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS):
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

1. General. The items listed do not constitute the order or limit the scope of the inspection or
assessment. As a minimum, units should use Unit Compliance Inspection (UCI) checklist in
conjunction with the Unit Self-Assessment. The objective is to identify deficiencies that preclude
attainment of required capabilities. Higher Headquarters may use this checklist in whole or in part
during visits or exercises.

     1.1. Core Compliance Guide Items (CCGI) and Compliance Guide Items (CGI). Items
     identified by functional managers to prioritize command requirements and to allow the Inspector
     General (HQ USAFE/IG) inspectors to assess criticality of deficiencies.
          1.1.1. CCGI. Items identified by HQ USAFE directorates and functional managers as key
          result areas for successful mission accomplishment including, but not limited to, items where
          non-compliance could result in serious injury, loss of life, excessive cost, litigation or affect
          system reliability. These requirements may be mandated by law, Executive Order, DoD
          directive, safety or Air Force and USAFE strategic plans. CCGIs are referred to as significant
          guide items requiring direct IG evaluation. Identify CCGIs by using uppercase and bold letters.
          1.1.2. CGI. CGI are areas that require special vigilance and are important to the overall
          performance of the unit. Noncompliance could result in some negative impact on mission
          performance but is not likely to result in injury, unnecessary cost, or litigation. Identify CGIs by
          using standard sentence case.
2. Applicability. See note at Table that indicates which type of library each checklist applies. The
