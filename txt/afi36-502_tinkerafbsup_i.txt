SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This is the first publication of AFI 36-502, substantially revising AFRs 40-312 and 40-112. It
updates, clarifies, and streamlines previous guidance on managing civilian personnel resources.

(TINKER) This revision updates text to coincide with the basic publication (paragraphs 2.2.,
2.3., and 2.4 updates office titles and functional address symbols, and updates roles and
responsibilities associated with moving from a one Obligation Authority Number (OBAN)
system to a two OBAN system.

(TINKERAFB) This change updates attachment designations within the publication, allows
further representation at the E4 OBAN CECMC, updates organizational designations in the U4
OBAN CECMC, and provides a TAFB Form 546 for CECMC over hire request.
1. Objective. The Air Force needs to manage civilian human resources within budget while
balancing:
    •   Mission needs.
    •   Operational economy and efficiency.
    •   Skills and career paths.
    •   Employee development and motivation.
    •   Recruitment and retention of competent people.
2. Civilian Resource Management Responsibility. Civilian resource management
responsibility is assigned down through the Air Force chain of command from the Secretary of
the Air Force to commanders of major commands (MAJCOM) or comparable organizations, to
subordinate commanders on down to first-level supervisors. Each manager who employs
civilian personnel within the chain of command must manage civilian resources properly and is
accountable for their immediate supervision. Managers and supervisors at each level must
evaluate their subordinate supervisors on how well they manage their civilian resources and take
appropriate action to correct or reward managers' performance.
    2.1. All managers and supervisors:
        •   Match civilian appointments (permanent, term, or temporary) to the projected length
            of the workload and the available funding. Appoint employees on a temporary basis
            when execution year dollars are used to fund the position from other than civilian pay.
            Make sure that employee work schedules accommodate both the employees' needs
            and the efficient and effective accomplishment of the mission.
        •   Make sure the Air Force Resource Allocation process approves reprogramming of
            civilian pay funds prior to committing to long-term resource management plans
AFI36-502_TINKERAFBSUP_I 10 March 2008                                                         3


         (decisions that commit resources for more than 2 years). Exercise personnel
         management authority to minimize adverse impact on the civilian workforce. Track
         civilian resource costs and take action to ensure successful budget execution.
     •   Tell the corporate board about surplus funds for redistribution (see paragraph2.2.)
     •   Prepare an employment plan for the following fiscal year, not later than March of
         each year.
     2.1.1. Managers and supervisors must set up positions and compensate and reward
     personnel within their civilian resource budget and in accordance with:
         •   Applicable authorities.
         •   Sound management practices.
         •   The advice and assistance of manpower, comptroller, and personnel specialists.
  2.2. MAJCOMs, field operating agencies, direct reporting units, and installation
  commanders establish a corporate board to make sure that civilian resources are used most
  efficiently and effectively. The commander or designated representative chairs the board,
  which includes functional managers and representatives from the civilian personnel, financial
  management, and manpower communities. The board:
     •   Reviews civilian resource management operating budget submissions at installation
         level.
     •   Periodically reviews employment plans and compares civilian pay expenditures
         against budgetary targets. Provides managers and supervisors with targets for the
         civilian resource operating budget, allocates directed adjustments, and redistributes
         any surplus funds.
     •   Establishes instructions on civilian resource management for the installation.
  2.2. (TINKERAFB) The Civilian Employment and Cost Management Committee
  (CECMC), as chaired by the OC-ALC Executive Director, the Personnel Directorate (OC-
  ALC/DP) and Financial Management Directorate (OC-ALC/FM), serve as the corporate
  board primarily responsible for Civilian Resource Management of the Operating Budget
  Account Number (OBAN) E4. Although the Executive Director primarily exercises
  authority over OBAN E4, the Center CECMC has oversight responsibility for all
  civilian employment planning (CEP) and execution within OC-ALC, which includes
  both OBANs U4 and E4. (Note: This is intended to provide OC-ALC/CA CEP
  oversight from a center perspective. The               72 ABW/CC will retain primary
  responsibility for program execution of OBAN U4 to include approval of ABW
  overhires.) The organizations having representation on this committee are designated in
  Attachment 2 of this supplement. OC-ALC/DP will provide copies of the charts and
  meeting minutes to each wing/staff office to include those not listed as CECMC members.
     2.2.1. (ADDED-TINKERAFB) The 72 ABW/CC will establish a CECMC committee
     that is responsible for civilian resource management of OBAN U4. Organizations
     represented for this committee are recommended in Attachment 3 (Added) of this
     supplement. 72 ABW Human Resource Manager (72 ABW/CCER) will provide
     copies of the charts and minutes of the CECMC meetings to each squadron/group to
4                                            AFI36-502_TINKERAFBSUP_I 10 March 2008


       include those not listed as ABW CECMC members. NOTE: As directed by the OC-
       ALC Executive Director, the 72 ABW will provide OBAN U4 updates and
       presentations at center CECMC meetings to ensure coordination and a holistic
       approach is communicated from an overall civilian employment management
       perspective.
       2.2.2. (ADDED-TINKERAFB) Both              committees     will    review     and     make
       recommendations on the Civilian Employment Plan (CEP) for their respective OBANs.
       Both committees shall review organizational targets and End of Year (EOY)
       projections; approve overhire requests; and review execution status to assure civilian pay
       is managed within approved funding levels, manpower authorizations and workyear
       allocations. Periodically, both committees will review and make recommendations
       as necessary on base personnel management programs and practices such as:
       performance management, affirmative employment objectives, labor/employee
       relations activities, high-grade programs, and force development. Requests for
       CECMC funded overhire positions must be submitted on TINKER AFB Form 546
       (see ATTACHMENT 4 [Added]) and will be reviewed and approved each fiscal
       year.
       2.2.3. (ADDED-TINKER) Both committees will review employment plans and
       recommend hiring policy to their respective commanders for accomplishing funding,
       manpower, or workload reprogramming decisions that involve changes to the civilian
       workforce.
       2.2.4. (ADDED-TINKERAFB) The center CECMC will convene quarterly at a
       minimum or at the discretion of OC-ALC Executive Director.
       2.2.5. (TINKERAFB) (DELETED).
    2.3. Air Force civilian personnel, financial management personnel, and manpower personnel
    jointly help managers and supervisors by:
       •   Developing, defending, and coordinating budgets, funding, utilization, and
           projections for civilian resources.
       •   Allocating manpower resources.
       •   Forecasting, executing, and adjusting civilian pay budgets.
       •   Advising managers and supervisors on human resource issues.
    2.3. (TINKERAFB) Organizations will conduct meetings as required with organizational
    resource managers. They will provide information at the working level on policies and
    changes affecting civilian personnel resources and disseminate reports tracking strength,
    authorizations, and targets.
       2.3.1. (ADDED-TINKERAFB) Organizations will work together to ensure that
       civilian pay for assigned personnel is properly accounted in the correct OBAN, Program
       Element Code (PEC), Responsibility Center/Cost Center (RC/CC) and Budget Activity
       (BA). This will ensure a correct accounting of workyear execution and funding
       utilization.
    2.4. Civilian Personnel Flights (CPF) assist managers and supervisors by:
AFI36-502_TINKERAFBSUP_I 10 March 2008                                                    5

      •   Consolidating installation employment plans not later than March and forwarding
          them to HQ USAF as required.
      •   Advising managers on how best to use civilian human resources.
   2.4. (TINKER) All references to CPF are replaced by OC-ALC/DP. OC-ALC/DP will
   develop employment plans and options to accomplish various workforce
   adjustments/realignments as needed.
      2.4.1. CPFs help determine the costs of position management, personnel administration,
      and operational requirements, including:
          •   The costs of recruitment and staffing.
          •   The kinds of skills available in the local labor market.
          •   Affirmative employment goals.
          •   The use of flexible work schedules and appointment types.
      2.4.1. (TINKERAFB) OC-ALC/DP will help determine the cost of position
      management, personnel administration, and operational requirement including:
   2.5. Manpower offices help managers and supervisors by:
      •   Determining and validating manpower requirements needed to accomplish the
          mission.
      •   Processing authorization change requests to the MAJCOMs for validated manpower
          requirements.
      •   Advising managers on how best to use manpower resources.
   2.6. Financial managers and comptrollers help managers and supervisors by:
      • Developing and defending civilian resource budget projections based on programs
         approved by the corporate board.
      •   Advising managers on budgeting techniques and practices, on how to execute their
          civilian resource budget, and on how best to use civilian resource funds.
      2.6.1. (ADDED-TINKERAFB) OC-ALC/FM and 72 CPTS/FM will work closely
      with HQ AFMC/FM to develop the workyear cost and provide funded workyear
      targets to OC-ALC/DP and 72 FSS/FSMC, respectively, based on information provided
      by AFMC. OC-ALC and 72 ABW personnel offices, in conjunction with resource
      managers, will develop a strength plan to execute the funded workyears.
      2.6.2. (Added-TINKER) 72 CPTS/FMFS will provide biweekly financial reports to
      OC-ALC/ FMA and 72 CPTS/FMAO. This data will be used for civilian pay funding
