This instruction implements AFPD 10-5, Basing. It provides guidance for the Air Staff, major
commands (MAJCOM), organizations, units, or functions as they prepare and manage PADs or
PPLANs.

(AFGSC) This supplement implements and extends the guidance of Air Force Instruction (AFI)
10-501, Program Action Directives (PAD) and Programming Plans (PPlan), 5 January 1994.
This supplement describes Air Force Global Strike Command’s (AFGSC) procedures for use in
conjunction with the basic AFI. It provides policy and delineates staff responsibilities to develop,
publish and control PPlans for basing actions associated with the activation, inactivation,
realignment or transfer of AFGSC installations and/or units and major system acquisitions and/or
conversions. It also describes the management structure, called a Site Action Task Force
(SATAF), which should be used for all basing actions. The PPlan guidance provided in this
supplement may also be used as guidance by AFGSC wings to develop, publish and control
 2                                                                  AFI10-501_AFGSCSUP_I 21 October 2011

1. Definition of Terms. See Attachment 1.
2. Objective of a PAD. A PAD describes Air Force initiatives that help accomplish a major
action. It assigns responsibilities and identifies critical tasks as milestones. In some cases,
MAJCOMs use a Headquarters US Air Force (HQ USAF) PAD as a basis for developing
PPLANs. A PAD may also describe Air Force initiatives supporting a major joint action, such as
AFI10-501_AFGSCSUP_I 21 October 2011                                                         3


establishing a new unified command. In such cases, the PAD serves as the Air Force part of a
joint implementation or programming document. See Attachment 2 for format.
3. Objective of a PPLAN. A PPLAN, like a PAD, describes Air Force initiatives that help
accomplish a major action, but in greater detail. A PPLAN, written below HQ USAF-level, is
usually more specific and focuses more on tasks or milestones.
   3.1. Some major actions, such as transferring a function from one command to another,
   require an inter-MAJCOM or interagency PPLAN.
   3.2. (Added-AFGSC) Programming Message (PMsg). When the scope of an action is
   significantly smaller than that requiring a complete PPlan, a PMsg is used. The AFGSC
   office of collateral responsibility (OCR) for PPlans, HQ AFGSC Strategic Basing Branch
   (A5PB), determines when a PMsg is appropriate.
4. Objective of a Program Guidance Letter (PGL). A PGL is an internal HQ USAF
document that provides formal guidance for actions within an organization or for transferring a
function from one organization to another within a command. Use PGLs when the level of detail
in a PAD is more than required. See Attachment 3 for format.
5. Responsibilities for PADs:
   5.1. HQ USAF Assistant Vice Chief of Staff decides which office within the HQ USAF will
   be responsible for a PAD, depending on the subject matter.
   5.2. PAD office of primary responsibility (OPR):
         Determines which organizations are needed to implement the action.
         Assigns responsibilities.
         Develops the PAD with help from Air Staff functional experts.
         Designates other OPRs and offices of collateral responsibility (OCR) to develop
          annexes, when necessary, that spell out to each organization what it must do.
         Gets approval from the sponsoring Deputy or Assistant Chief of Staff.
         Prints and distributes the PAD.
         Terminates the PAD when it is no longer needed or the actions are complete.
   5.3. HQ USAF/XOOB is the OPR for AFI 10-501, provides guidance to PAD OPRs, and
   numbers PADs sequentially within each fiscal year (i.e., 94-1, 94-2).
6. Responsibilities for PPLANs:
   6.1. MAJCOMs and agencies develop procedures for program guidance such as PPLANs.
       6.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) When To Prepare an AFGSC Basing PPlan:
          6.1.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) An AFGSC PPlan is required when a basing decision
          results in a significant change in force structure or mission affecting two or more
          organizations. Examples of basing decisions include: unit activations, inactivation
          and deactivations; realignments involving the physical move of people or assets; base
          closures; beddown of weapon systems; unit conversions from one weapons system to
4                                             AFI10-501_AFGSCSUP_I 21 October 2011


       another; beddown and/or integration of specialized systems or unique organizational
       constructs; and increases or decreases in a unit's primary aircraft inventory.
    6.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) Format. The format for an AFGSC PPlan is contained in the
    PPlan Guide at Attachment 4 (Added). AFGSC PPlans are serially numbered by fiscal
    year; for example, 0X-01, 0X-02, etc. HQ AFGSC/A5P only assigns PPlan numbers for
    documents originated by the HQ AFGSC staff.
    6.1.3. (Added-AFGSC) Responsibilities:
       6.1.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) HQ AFGSC Plans, Policy & Integration Division (A5P)
       will:
          6.1.3.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Determine the office of primary responsibility
          (OPR) for each HQ AFGSC Basing PPlan. The OPR is the command proponent
          of the action for the proposed program. HQ AFGSC/A5PB is the PPlan OCR.
          AFGSC/A5PB is the OPR for site survey and SATAF processes in accordance
          with AFI10-503_AFGSCSUP, Strategic Basing. The PPlan OPR will assign
          management responsibility to a program manager who is familiar with the
          objective of the programming document and has a working knowledge of the
          functional areas that will participate in its development and execution. The
          program manager must provide his or her name, grade, office symbol, and
          telephone number to HQ AFGSC/A5PB.
          6.1.3.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) Process PPlan requests from other HQ AFGSC staff
          agencies. Develop guidance and provide information to all applicable Directorates
          for their use in defining project requirements with a goal of developing a pertinent
          PPlan and/or annexes to a PPlan. Assist PPlan OPR (Proponent/Program
          Manager) in reviewing, coordinating, and distributing the final Basing PPlan.
          Serve as SATAF manager unless management by another Directorate would
          enhance implementation.
       6.1.3.2. (Added-AFGSC) HQ AFGSC Directors will: Ensure directorate
       coordination is timely and complete. Coordinate on the e-SSS during final staff
       review. All Directors requiring programming plans notify HQ AFGSC/A5P as soon
       as a requirement is known.
       6.1.3.3. (Added-AFGSC) Participating HQ AFGSC Functional Staff Agencies will
       appoint Functional Area POCs to:
          6.1.3.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) Furnish information needed to develop a draft basic
          plan to implement HQ AFGSC-generated programs.
          6.1.3.3.2. (Added-AFGSC) Attend planning conferences, conduct internal staff
          agency coordination, review the basic plan, and develop supporting functional
          staff annexes.
          6.1.3.3.3. (Added-AFGSC) Coordinate within their respective staff agency, with
          other HQ AFGSC staff agencies and with counterparts in non-AFGSC agencies
          when those agencies are affected by their respective annex or time-phased actions.
          6.1.3.3.4. (Added-AFGSC) Furnish finished staff annexes, appendixes and a list
          of time-phased actions for the draft PPlan.
AFI10-501_AFGSCSUP_I 21 October 2011                                                        5


           6.1.3.3.5. (Added-AFGSC) Monitor the status of subordinate unit time-phased
           actions and help resolve problems as required.
           6.1.3.3.6. (Added-AFGSC) Monitor the status of their time-phased actions and
           submit progress reports to the PPlan OPR (Program Manager).
           6.1.3.3.7. (Added-AFGSC) Monitor the adequacy and currency of their
           respective functional staff annexes and submit corrections or changes to PPlan
           OPR (Proponent/Program Manager) for publication.
        6.1.3.4. (Added-AFGSC) PPlan Program Manager (appointed by the PPlan
        OPR/Proponent) prepares Basing PPlans to be approved by HQ AFGSC Director of
        Plans, Programs and Requirements (A5/8) unless delegated otherwise. The program
        manager is responsible for completing the PPlan Development Checklist and, in
        coordination with AFGSC/A5PB, drafting the SATAF E-Staffing Tasker, when a
        SATAF is required / applicable. The program manager is also responsible for
        development of the PPlan: Basic Plan, Annex A, and their appropriate functional
        annex (See PPlan Guide, Attachment 4 (Added) of this supplement for additional
        information.) Program managers will not publish or distribute Basing PPlans or
        changes thereto without HQ AFGSC/A5/8 approval. The program manager reviews
        progress reports from the field for items that require action and coordinates with the
        responsible agency within the Headquarters to resolve problems.
        6.1.3.5. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC PPlans direct AFGSC organizations, and will be
        duly coordinated with any other affected organizations, where applicable. Tracking
        PPlan taskings is the specific responsibility of the program manager of the PPlan.
        When the PPlan objective is fulfilled and all taskings are complete, the program
        manager will notify HQ AFGSC/A5P who will formally close the PPlan with a memo
        or message to the organizations/agencies affected by the PPlan.
        6.1.3.6. (Added-AFGSC) The HQ AFGSC/A5PB point of contact for the proposed
        program will schedule and conduct site surveys and SATAF visits as required and is
        the command representative (team chief) for these actions. He/she will also assist the
        program manager in completing, coordinating, and editing the PPlan.
     6.1.4. (Added-AFGSC) Environmental:
        6.1.4.1. (Added-AFGSC) The program manager (proponent) should promptly
        initiate an environmental impact analysis for all proposed actions in conjunction with
        PPlan development. Title 32, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 989 (32 CFR Part
        989), Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP) is the controlling document for
        the Air Force EIAP.
        6.1.4.2. (Added-AFGSC) All actions require submission of an AF IMT 813,
        Request for Environmental Impact Analysis, to the host environmental planning
        function for review and final disposition. If the action is on a non-AFGSC base, the
        proponent must request the host environmental planning function initiate the
        environmental impact analysis process by submitting the AF IMT 813. Within
        AFGSC, the environmental planning function is in HQ AFGSC/A7A, who may direct
        the host installation to accomplish the analysis. The proponent must state in the
        PPlan that the environmental impact analysis has begun and indicate its status at the
6                                             AFI10-501_AFGSCSUP_I 21 October 2011


       time of PPlan publication. The proponent will make the AF IMT 813 available for
       review during the entire planning and review phase and notify annex managers of its
       final disposition. No irrevocable PPlan actions will be taken until the environmental
       impact analysis process is complete.
    6.1.5. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC Bases. The commander’s staff at an AFGSC base will
    use this supplement as a guide for preparing a base-level IPlan. Where required by a
    PPlan, AFGSC bases must prepare an IPlan in support of said PPlan. AFGSC bases may
    also prepare an IPlan as required to meet base level needs without an existing PPlan.
    AFGSC bases are authorized to develop IPlans with their tenant organizations as
    required.
    6.1.6. (Added-AFGSC) HQ AFGSC Directorates and Organizations. HQ AFGSC
    directorates and organizations may use this PPlan format as a guide for developing
    AFGSC planning documents for programs not involving basing decisions. These
    planning documents will be signed by the OPR’s director or commander and be
    processed through HQ AFGSC/A5P for issuance of an AFGSC PPlan number and entry
    into the PPlan library.
    6.1.7. (Added-AFGSC) Management of Reports:
       6.1.7.1. (Added-AFGSC) Web-based reporting system - general guidance: All
       reporting associated with the implementation of AFGSC PPlans/PMsgs is
       accomplished electronically through the AFGSC PPlan Library. Training will be
       provided by AFGSC/A5PB. To access the PPlan Library, visit the following address:
       https://afgsc-p.eis.af.mil/internal (tab at top of page) Reporting on the status of a
       PPlan/PMsg will commence upon publication, however, updates on time-phased
       actions can be made at any time.
       6.1.7.2. (Added-AFGSC) PPlan Program Manager will: Ensure monthly
       submission of commander’s comments. The assessment will include the
       commander’s view of overall current status and should highlight any significant
       problem areas requiring senior leadership attention. Each month the program manager
       will assign an overall assessment of the program (See Attachment 1 for assessment
       criteria) and will provide a brief synopsis of program status. Individuals updating the
       manager’s assessment will add the date, their name, and office symbol as part of the
       update.
       6.1.7.3. (Added-AFGSC) HQ AFGSC Functional Area POCs will: Ensure all
       time-phased actions within their respective area are updated and maintained in a
       current status. Reporting agencies must update their time-phased actions as soon as
       possible after completion. Update time-phased actions in accordance with the
       following guidance: Provide a brief synopsis of the progress made towards
       completion, highlighting any potential problems on a monthly basis. If a potential
       problem is noted, describe the proposed corrective action. If the time-phased action
       has been completed, state by what action, including the date completed. Individuals
       updating the time-phased action will provide the date, their name, and office symbol
       as part of the update. Every effort must be made to complete time-phased actions by
       the dates originally established. If a slip is required, the PPlan Program Manager
       should be notified immediately and justification needs to be provided. Once the
AFI10-501_AFGSCSUP_I 21 October 2011                                                          7


        Program Manager approves the slip, the Time-Phased Action OPR can make the
        appropriate change in the AFGSC PPlan Library.
        6.1.7.4. (Added-AFGSC) Normal Staff Actions. Progress reports do not replace
        normal channels for requesting higher echelon help. When a problem that causes a
        delay, or threatens to cause a delay is identified, action agencies at all levels should
        take the appropriate corrective action or request help from the command OPR to
        correct the problem.
  6.2. If a MAJCOM or agency needs a HQ USAF PAD as a basis for a PPLAN, they ask the
  Air Staff to develop one or designate a PAD OPR.

Terms
Major Action—An initiative in which several organizations work cooperatively towards a
common goal by consolidating taskings, OPRs, and other separate directives.
Program Action Directive (PAD)—A formal planning document that helps accomplish a major
action such as the reorganization or formation of a MAJCOM, organization, unit, or function.
Examples include establishing Air Education and Training Command, normalizing Air Force
AFI10-501_AFGSCSUP_I 21 October 2011                                                               9


Intelligence, or carrying out directions from the Defense Base Closure and Realignment
Commission. The PAD is also used to direct programs on new acquisitions and modifications.
It states the objective of the program, assigns specific tasks to OPRs and OCRs, and establishes
milestones.
Program Guidance Letter (PGL)—A formal planning document that establishes direction,
assigns tasks, and provides guidance (for example, Morale, Welfare, and Recreation/Services
integration or Civil Air Patrol reorganization).
Programming Plan (PPLAN)—A formal planning document written below HQ USAF-level
that helps accomplish and record major actions.
(AFGSC) Annex— A major subdivision of a PPlan prepared by a functional staff agency. An
annex contains enough detail to stand alone. It establishes the tasks and procedures which the
functional agency and subordinate elements must complete to attain the basic plan's objective. If
a formal annex is not necessary, the Director may submit a paragraph of functional area
instructions to be included in the basic plan.
(AFGSC) Appendix— A subdivision of an annex providing additional detail, such as time-
phased actions, and/or SATAF working group minutes, for the respective functional area.
(AFGSC) Basic Plan— The PPlan OPR (with assistance from the PPlan OCR) writes the Basic
Plan. It contains the purpose, authority, references, participating organizations, program
guidance, background, responsibilities, milestones and program management guidance of the
Plan. If possible, the Basic Plan is distributed to the PPlan project officers at or before the first
working group meeting, in cases where such meeting is needed to facilitate PPlan development.
(AFGSC) Changes— After the PPlan is signed, changes, clarification, etc., to an annex or
appendix may only be added after written coordination through the PPlan OPR and OCR. The
best time to recommend changes is during three-letter and two-letter coordination.
(AFGSC) Distribution— PPlan OPR prepares Annex Z which lists final distribution of PPlan.
At a minimum, distribution is made to HQ AF/A8PB, affected MAJCOM directorates and
affected Wing/CCs.
(AFGSC) Event— An action needed to complete a milestone.
(AFGSC) Formal Change— A published PPlan change sent to all distribution addressees.
(AFGSC) Functional Area POC— Identifies and monitors all actions needed within a
functional area to accomplish the project on time. Develops functional area PPlan annex and any
required appendixes thereof. Tracks, assesses and oversees status of time-phased actions and
provides status to PPlan OPR, (Proponent/Program Manager).
(AFGSC) Joint Programming Plan— A coordinated inter-command document which defines
program objectives in detail and identifies and assigns inter-command staff responsibilities and
ensures required actions are completed on time. When AFGSC is the lead command, the Director
of Plans, or equivalent, of each participating organization signs the final Basic PPlan.
(AFGSC) Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)— A designated staff office that develops
and manages a PPlan. An overall command functional OPR is designated for each PPlan. The
OPR is the command proponent of the action for the proposed program. The PPlan OPR will
assign management responsibility to a program manager who is familiar with the objective of the

programming document and has a working knowledge of the functional areas that will
participate in its development and execution. The program manager must provide his or her
name, grade, office symbol, and telephone number to HQ AFGSC/A5PB. Additionally,
participating HQ AFGSC staff agencies are OPRs for their respective functional annexes which
support the objectives and guidance in the basic plan. HQ AFGSC staff agencies must provide
their functional area POCs/working group leads/alternates (for their respective functional annex)
name, grade, office symbol, and telephone number to the PPlan OPR (Proponent/Program
manager).
(AFGSC) Programming Plan (PPlan) A PPlan provides broad guidance to accomplish a
particular one—time, non-recurring project (e.g., unit relocation, system acquisition/beddown,
or base closure or drawdown). It documents the project's objective and actions necessary for
implementation. PPlan content may vary depending on the type of action involved. PPlans
identify essential actions (for example: personnel actions, delivery schedule of new unit
equipment, essential facilities required and available, logistics and sustainment activities) to
accomplish a program. A PPlan is a coordinated document which identifies staff actions and
assigns staff responsibilities for defining program objectives in detail and for making sure future
actions are completed on time. Functional staff agencies are responsible for additional
requirements which may or may not be specifically addressed in a PPlan but are related to or
arise from the intent of the plan. Each agency is responsible for developing detailed action plans,
as necessary, which supplement HQ AFGSC PPlans to ensure successful execution of the PPlan.
When acquiring an installation from another command, the gaining command is responsible for
preparation of the PPlan. Write a PPlan as soon as enough information is available and authority
exists. Development and coordination of a PMsg is identical for that of a PPlan in accordance
with this supplement. For any given action, HQ AFGSC/A5P will determine whether to use a
PPlan or PMsg. A Programming Message (PMsg) is a condensed PPlan in message format. It
will be used when the scope of an action is significantly smaller than that requiring a complete
PPlan.
(AFGSC) Project— A set of activities and a schedule required to accomplish a one-time
undertaking of limited duration (normally two years or less) such as a base closure, unit transfer
or inactivation, or system beddown.
(AFGSC) Project Officers (see Functional Area POCs)— Individuals selected within each
staff agency to develop and manage an element of a PPlan. Each project officer reviews the
entire PPlan for additions and corrections, prepares required data, coordinates with all
appropriate agencies and provides inputs in the approved format to the PPlan OPR.
(AFGSC) SATAF— The SATAF process provides periodic, on-scene assistance to unit-level
agencies to accomplish a program objective. It employs appropriate members of the HQ AFGSC
and/or supporting command staffs, under the leadership of HQ AFGSC/A5PB. The SATAF
structure is comprised of headquarters team members and representation from the affected
unit(s), which are organized into functional working groups. Each working group has an
assigned chairperson, who functions under the auspices of the SATAF Team Chief.
(AFGSC) A SATAF may be convened to support bringing a program, system, equipment
and/or site to operational readiness. SATAFs are also conducted to facilitate unit
activations, inactivations, deactivations, relocations, and conversions from one weapon
system to another. Additionally, SATAFs are conducted for AFGSC actions directed by the
AFI10-501_AFGSCSUP_I 21 October 2011                                                      11


Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission. SATAFs for other types of actions
occasionally occur, and are negotiated on a case—by-case basis. Whenever possible,
documentation resulting from the SATAF process is incorporated into its respective PPlan. The
documentation is comprised of minutes for each functional working group, time-phased actions
identified by each working group, and an executive summary.
The following is a brief synopsis of program assessment criteria associated with PPlans/PMsgs
and their related SATAFs:
(AFGSC) GREEN— program or action on track; objective and timing attainable.
(AFGSC) YELLOW— high-risk workarounds and/or insufficient information available for
program assessment.
(AFGSC) RED— program or action objective will not be attained and/or prescribed timelines
will not be met. Senior Leadership involvement may be required.
(AFGSC) Time—Phased Action (TPA) - An action required to be completed by a specified
time to support the plan. They consist of milestones, numbered sequentially beginning with
number one, and action items with prefixes are prescribed by the functional area (i.e., for
Operations, A3-1XX, A3-2XX, etc.)

8. PROGRAM MANAGEMENT:

  8.1. This PPlan provides basic guidance for implementing the actions specified in PAD 11-
       XY realign Mission XYZ and equipment to Barksdale AFB. Functional POCs are
       required to monitor actions directed in the PPlan to ensure timely completion.

     8.1.1. HQ AFGSC/A5PB will coordinate and publish the PPlan. The basic plan,
            functional annexes and associated time-phased actions reflect major tasks to be
            accomplished. The PPlan will ensure the Command actions required are
            identified, enumerated, reviewed, coordinated, programmed and implemented.
            The signed PPlan may be distributed via E-mail.

     8.1.2. Functional staff agencies will accomplish specified time-phased actions.

     8.1.3. Functional staff agencies are responsible for additional requirements that may not
            be specifically addressed in this PPlan but are related to or arise from the intent of
            the plan.

     8.1.4. Direct coordination between participating agencies is authorized.

     8.1.5   Any disagreements concerning plan implementation will be documented and
             routed through respective chains of command for review/resolution.

  8.2. HQ AFGSC functional OPRs are responsible for the programmed objectives of this
       PPlan. Each affected directorate will designate—and update within 30 days of any
       change—a functional OPR to act as the single POC and project officer for the
       directorate. Project officer appointments are reflected in Appendix I to the Basic Plan.
       HQ AFGSC project officers will:

     8.2.1. Prepare annexes/time-phased actions for this PPlan. Annexes will clearly state the
            tasks and timelines required for the realignment and facility construction. If
            required, attach an appendix to the annex detailing time-phased actions and events
            to be accomplished to meet objectives of this plan.

     8.2.2. Submit their inputs to HQ AFGSC/A3Z for review. HQ AFGSC/A3Z will
            consolidate the annexes. HQ AFGSC/A5PB will distribute the entire PPlan for
            coordination.

     8.2.3. Monitor and update functional annexes and corresponding appendices.

(1) ―Assessment‖ window: Provide a brief synopsis of the progress made towards completion, highlighting any
potential problems on a monthly basis. All modifications to time-phased actions must be vetted through the program
manager for approval.
(2) ―Suspense‖ window: Every effort should be made to complete time-phased actions by the dates as originally
established. If a slip is required, the PPlan Program Manager should be notified immediately and justification needs
to be provided. Once the Program Manager approves the slip, the Functional Area POC can make the appropriate
change in the AFGSC PPlan Library.
e. The PPlan Program Manager will ensure monthly submission of commander’s comments. The assessment will
include the Commander’s view of overall current status and should highlight any significant problem areas requiring
senior leadership attention. Each month the HQ PPlan Program Manager will assign an overall assessment of the
program (red, green or yellow) and will provide a brief synopsis of program status within the ―manager’s
assessment‖ window.

f. The PPlan Program Manager will notify AFGSC/A5PB when all time-phased actions have been completed.
AFGSC/A5PB will then generate a PPlan closure message.

annexes will have Time-Phased Actions to reflect critical time events. Milestones are in numeric
order sequentially beginning with one. Action items are covered in a separate (from the PPlan)
action item workbook – see AFGSC/A5PB for example.
