               AIR FORCE PUBLICATIONS AND FORMS MANAGEMENT

1.1. Overview. This instruction establishes guidance and procedures for Air Force-wide
publications and forms management, to include the publishing process. Air Force units at all
levels must ensure publications and forms are complete, accurate, current, and accessible to Air
Force users.
     1.1.1. Official Air Force publications (those listed in Table 2.1 and processed in accordance
     with this Instruction) are the only approved vehicles for issuing official Air Force policy
     and/or guidance. Air Force publications are either directive or non-directive in nature.
     Official Air Force publications communicate policy, issue guidance and procedures, or
     simply serve to inform; those processed by AFDPO are accessible through the e-Publishing
     website (www.e-publishing.af.mil). The e-Publishing website is open to the public, so only
     the unclassified titles of classified and restricted access products will be provided along with
     instructions on how to obtain copies from the OPR.
     1.1.2. Forms provide an expanded capability to manage the collection, storage, retrieval, and
     display of data. Official Air Force forms, with the exception of ANG forms and those
     generated below the wing/base level, are processed and disseminated in accordance with this
     publication; prescribed forms are available for downloading or ordering on the e-Publishing
     website. Official Air Force form types are defined in Section 3B.
     1.1.3. The publishing process includes formatting, posting, and storing electronic products;
     printing procurement for multi-color and unique physical products; the design of Air Force
     approved forms; and processing, storing, and disseminating physical products. Ultimately,
     publishing operations are designed to provide customers Air Force-wide access to electronic
     and physical products via the e-Publishing website (via direct download or direct order). The
     website serves as the official repository for departmental and field publications and forms (at
     the wing/base level and above) and for ordering of physical products down to the wing/base
     level that are processed by AFDPO. The National Guard Publications Management Center
     (NGB-DMJ-P) (http://www.ngbpdc.ngb.army.mil/publications.htm) is the official
     repository for all ANG products; headquarters ANG publications will also be available on the
     e-Publishing website.
        1.1.3.1. The publication date is the effective date; Air Force publications, to include AF
        Policy Memorandums and Guidance Memorandums, are not considered effective until
        they are released to users in accordance with this Instruction. The publishing activity
        (AFDPO, Publication Manager, or OPR in rare instances when local websites are used)
        adds the date to the publication to reflect the day the publication is actually released to
        users (placed on formal website). The date the approving official signs the AF Form 673,
        Air Force Publication/Form Action Request, may not be the effective date of the
        publication.
        1.1.3.1. (45 SW) Effective and Expiration Dates. The Air Force Departmental
        Publishing Office, AFDPO, dates all publications with a date following signature by the
        approval authority.

  1.2.5. Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR): OPRs are solely responsible for the
  accuracy, currency, and integrity of the contents and for compliance with their publications
  and forms:
     1.2.5.1. The OPR designates an individual within the office to serve as the Point of
     Contact (POC) for each publication and form. That individual will meet all OPR
     responsibilities, although the organization retains ultimate responsibility. The POC must
     be an Air Force civilian employee or a military member (including direct-hire foreign
     nationals but not indirect-hire foreign nationals or contractors).
     1.2.5.2. The POC consults with their publications and forms management office before
     developing a publication and/or form and at any point during the publishing process for
     guidance/advice. Adheres to publishing guidance and requirements contained in this
     Instruction.
     1.2.5.2. (45 SW) OPRs of 45th Space Wing publications and/or prescribed forms
     contact 45 SCS/SCOKC before developing a publication for format requirements and the
     coordination process.
     1.2.5.3. The POC staffs publishing product with the appropriate coordinating
     organizations (see Section 2D).
         1.2.5.3.1. The POC resolve all critical comments before the publication or form may
         be submitted for final processing and publishing.
         1.2.5.3.2. If the AF Form 673 or the AF IMT 1768, Staff Summary Sheet (SSS),
         contains coordination more than one year old and no significant changes to the draft
         contents have been made, POCs must state in block 32 of the AF Form 673 that no
         recoordination is necessary before the certifying and approval officials sign the form.
         If significant changes have been made the POC must reaccomplish coordination.
     1.2.5.4. Based on the guidance in AFI 31-401, Information Security Program
     Management, the POC recommends a level of accessibility for the publication: post on
     the e-Publishing website (a public site), or restrict access. Departmental classified and
     FOUO publications will be automatically scheduled for printing; discuss production
     alternatives with the publications/forms manager if a printed product is not ideal.
     Unclassifiedtitlesfordepartmentalandfield-generatedFOUOandclassified          publications
     must be included in the Product Index and in the publications listing on the e- Publishing
     website.
     1.2.5.5. The POC keeps existing publications and prescribed forms current. Submits
     cancellation requests to the publications/forms manager on the AF Form 673 after
     obtaining certification and approval.
     1.2.5.6. The POC informs designated publications/forms manager using AF Form 673,
     Air Force Publication/Form Action Request, when transferring responsibility for a
     publication or form to another organization (see paragraph 2.22.4).
     1.2.5.7. HAF OPRs keep official record sets for publications and forms (see paragraph
     2.31.4.1).
     1.2.5.8. The POC ensures the proposed publication does not conflict with or
     unnecessarily duplicate higher headquarters policies or procedures.
AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                             15


     1.2.5.9. The POC fields questions related to the publication or form, and evaluates
     proposed changes to the publication or form.
     1.2.5.10. The POC receives, evaluates, and staffs waiver requests, elevating within the
     organization for review and approval as necessary.
  1.2.6. Certifying Officials. The certifying official is a minimum of one organizational level
  above the OPR (as opposed to the POC) and certifies the need for the publication, to include
  currency of information, applicability to the Air Force, and propriety of content by signing
  the AF Form 673 at block 19. If the certifier one level above the OPR is the approval
  authority, the director/head of the POC’s organization should serve as the certifying official.
  NOTE: Before signing the AF Form 673, it is the responsibility of the certifying official to
  make sure the publication is not less restrictive than the higher headquarters publication. If
  needed, it can be more restrictive.
     1.2.6.1. Departmental publications authored by a field unit (e.g., a MAJCOM, FOA, or
     DRU) must be certified by an individual at the HAF and approved by the appropriate
     HAF two-letter. AF Policy Directives (AFPDs), AF Policy Memorandums (AFPMs), and
     AF Supplements to DOD Directives (DODDs) must be approved by the SECAF.
  1.2.7. Approving Officials.
  1.2.7. (45 SW) Certification and Approval. The 45 SW/CC is the approving authority
  official for NEW, first issue 45th Space Wing publications. This authority may not be
  delegated, except the 45 SW/CV may sign for the 45 SW/CC when on orders. Approving
  official authority for revised publications is delegated to the 45 SW/CV. This responsibility
  may not be further delegated. NOTE: A revised publication is one that supersedes or
  changes a previous edition originally approved by the actual approving authority official
  when first published.
     1.2.7.1. Approving officials are senior leaders responsible for policies and
     guidance/procedures pertaining to their functional area, specialty series, or command. At
     Headquarters Air Force (HAF) and MAJCOMs these are heads of functional two-
     letter/digit offices, acting heads of two-letter/digit offices, or deputy heads if the two-
     letter/digit is unable to provide approval. EXCEPTION: MAJCOM Commanders may
     move approval authority up to their level through a Supplement to this Instruction. Below
     the HAF and MAJCOM level, these are commanders/ directors (acting
     commanders/directors, or deputy commanders/directors, if the commander/director is
     unable to provide approval) that are responsible for guidance/procedures pertaining to
     activities under their command/direction. NOTE: Establishing Air Force-wide policy is
     an authority that rests solely with the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF), who will
     review, authenticate, approve, and rescind all AFPDs, AFPMs, and AF Supplements to
     DoDDs and DoDIs containing policy. Approval officials at all levels will:
         1.2.7.1.1. Enforce procedures and guidance contained in publications within their
         functional area(s).
         1.2.7.1.2. Approve publications within their functional area, specialty series, or
         command (those Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC) associated with their
         organizations) by signing the AF Form 673 at block 22, which verifies information in
         the publication and identifies publication restrictions. In signing the AF Form 673, the
16                                                  AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


        approval authority is also confirming that the information therein is by order of the
        SECAF or Commander/Director, as appropriate. The functional principal’s
        authentication (signature block (not signature): name, rank, and title) appears on the
        last page of the publication (including AFPMs and GMs) before the attachments. The
        SECAF will always be the approval authority on AFPDs, AFPMs, and AF
        supplements to DoDDs and DoDIs containing policy.
        1.2.7.1.3. Approve, as the Air Force original classification authority (OCA), all
        security classification guidance contained in a publication. The OCA ensures the
        classification guidance complies with AFI 31-401. Departmental classified and
        FOUO publications will be automatically scheduled for printing; discuss production
        alternatives with the publications/forms manager if a printed product is not ideal.
        1.2.7.1.4. Determine the need to delegate authority to sign as the approving authority
        on the AF Form 673 and provide functional coordination for revisions to existing
        publications. The approval authority shall not be delegated outside of the issuing
        organization/unit/activity (e.g., HAF, MAJCOM, Center, NAF, Wing, Group,
        Squadron). Approval authority for new publications may not be delegated. When
        approval authority is delegated for revised publications, the signature
        block/authentication will remain that of the approving official as defined in
        paragraph 1.2.7.1 that delegated the authority (e.g., SECAF for Air Force policy
        publications, HAF two-letter/digit for departmental guidance publications, MAJCOM
        two-letter/digit for MAJCOM Publications, Wing Commander for Wing publications,
        etc.)."
            1.2.7.1.4.1. Ensure the delegation of approval authority, whether for a single
            publication or a blanket request for several publications, is in writing, signed, and
            dated, and either accompanies the AF Form 673 and the revised draft or remains
            on file with the publications/forms manager.
  1.2.8. Mandatory and Technical/Functional Coordinators.
     1.2.8.1. Mandatory and technical/functional coordinators are responsible for reviewing
     and providing coordination on publications and forms from their particular functional
     perspective or area of expertise based on the rules established in the coordination tables
     (Table 2.2, Table 2.3, and Table 3.2).
     1.2.8.2. Publications and forms will be submitted to two-letter organizations, unless
     otherwise directed in the coordination tables. Two-letters are responsible for ensuring
     the correct offices within the organization review and coordinate on the publication
     and/or form and for providing a consolidated response. The consolidated response
     does not necessarily have to carry a two-letter level signature; the two-letter may
     designate a lower-level office within the organization to provide the response and
     sign off on the coordination form provided (i.e., the AF Form 673 or the AF IMT
     1768, Staff Summary Sheet).
     1.2.8.3. If a mandatory or technical/functional organization is not able to meet the
     suspense date for coordination, a request for an extension must be submitted to the OPR.
     1.2.8.4. Coordination may be provided on the AF Form 673, the AF IMT 1768 provided
     by the OPR, or via email. Use a continuation sheet, if necessary.
AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                            17


        1.2.8.4.1. In providing concurrence, reviewers agree to the contents within a
        publication/form from a functional perspective. Additionally, reviewers are agreeing
        to the releasability of the publication, as stated by the OPR in the publication. If the
        contents or purpose of a publication/ form are in conflict with existing policy or
        guidance, or if the releasability as stated in the publication is not in keeping with
        guidance in AFI 31-401, reviewers must provide feedback to the OPR accordingly.

                                        PUBLICATIONS

Section 2A—Research and Applicability

2.1. Planning and Research. Inadequate research on new publications or revisions could result
in issuing more than one publication on the same subject, conflicting instructions, or publishing a
nonessential or incomplete publication. Check the e-Publishing website to find out if any other
publication has a similar subject. If there is a related publication, consider consolidation. Obtain
inputs from subordinate activities during the drafting process and add all suitable information to
reduce the need for additional implementing publications. Regularly review publications for
administrative changes (such as change in organization symbols, office realignment, OPR, etc.).
Carefully review this Instruction for guidance on selecting the right publication/form type,
formatting standards, coordination requirements, and maintaining the publication or form.
2.2. Validity of a Publication. Official Air Force publications (those listed in Table 2.1 and
processed in accordance with this instruction) are the only approved vehicles for issuing official
Air Force policy and/or guidance. The e-Publishing website is the official repository for Air
Force publications and forms at the wing/base level and above for activities supported by
AFDPO; unless cited as an exception in this AFI those not listed on the e-Publishing website
down to the wing/base level are not considered official policy or guidance. NGB-DMJ-P
(http://www.ngbpdc.ngb.army.mil/publications.htm) is the official repository for ANG
products. POCs, certifying officials, and approving officials for Air Force publications must be
either military members or civilian employees (including direct-hire foreign nationals, but not
including contractors or indirect-hire foreign nationals). When an approving official vacates his
or her position, publications showing the individual’s signature element remain in effect until
rescinded or rewritten. When a unit reorganizes, current publications remain valid and in effect
until superseded or rescinded.
2.3. Conflicting Publications. When guidance in a publication issued by a field unit conflicts
with the guidance issued by a higher-level unit, the higher-level publication takes precedence.
   2.3.1. When a unit issues a publication that conflicts with one of its own publications, the
   activity noting the discrepancy should submit an AF Form 847 to both OPRs highlighting the
   conflict and requesting a resolution. OPRs are responsible for working with each other to
   deconflict and issue the correct publication(s).
   2.3.2. If a field activity notices a discrepancy between higher-headquarters publications,
   submit an AF IMT 847 to both OPRs, following the chain of command, as appropriate. AF
   IMT 847s submitted for HAF publications must be sent through the appropriate functional’s
   chain of command.
2.4. Applicability of Publications to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Units.
2.4. (45 SW)Applicability to the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). The 45th Space
Wing publishing activity will not issue publications that apply to the AFRC. If it is determined
this requirement exists, the local publishing activity will contact AFNIC/EASP for guidance.
AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                           19


  2.4.1. Applicability of Departmental Publications to AFRC Units. All departmental
  publications requiring mandatory coordination must be reviewed for applicability to AFRC
  Units. Electronic coordination may be obtained by submitting the draft publication to the
  AF/RE workflow inbox. The primary POC within AF/RE is responsible for obtaining
  coordination from other interested staff offices within AF/RE. The OPR of the publication
  must include a statement of applicability in the opening paragraph of the draft. AF/RE will
  either concur with the OPR’s chosen statement of applicability or supply a new statement.
  NOTE: As the Air Force moves closer to total force functioning, publications should be
  written to support the functioning of all types of Air Force employees/members, including
  Reserve forces. However, when AF/RE takes exception to specific portions of a publication
  due to dissimilarities with the way the Reserve community operates, the OPR will not
  publish it until all exceptions are resolved. OPRs will require justification from AF/RE when
  exception is taken. Send unresolved issues to the appropriate Secretariat or Air Staff office
  for resolution, in accordance with AFI 10-301, Responsibilities of Air Reserve Component
  (ARC) Forces. Statements of applicability are as follows:
     2.4.1.1. When the entire publication applies, include the following statement: "This
     publication applies to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Units."
     2.4.1.2. When only specific portions apply, include a statement such as "Chapter [or
     paragraph— include specific number(s)] of this publication apply to Air Force Reserve
     Command (AFRC) Units."
     2.4.1.3. When only specific portions do not apply include a statement such as "This
     publication applies to Air Force Reserve Command units, with the exception of [list the
     portions that do not apply]."
     2.4.1.4. If the entire publication does not apply, include the following statement: "This
     publication does not apply to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Units."
  2.4.2. Applicability of MAJCOM Publications to AFRC Units. All new and rewritten
  MAJCOM publications must be reviewed for applicability to AFRC Units. Electronic
  coordination may be obtained by clicking on the "Gaining Command Publication
  Coordination" link located on the AFRC secure homepage at https://wwwmil.afrc.af.mil.
  Go to the "Headquarters" button, find the "Gaining Command and RE Coords" and request
  coordination from the appropriate functional. The primary POC within AFRC is responsible
  for obtaining coordination from other staff offices within AFRC as appropriate. The OPR of
  the publication must include a statement of applicability in the opening paragraph of the
  draft. AFRC will either concur with the OPR’s chosen statement of applicability (selected
  from statements provided in 2.4.1.1–2.4.1.4) or supply a new statement. NOTE: As the Air
  Force moves closer to total force functioning, publications should be written to support the
  functioning of all types of Air Force employees/members, including Reserve forces.
  However, when the AFRC takes exception to specific portions of a publication due to
  dissimilarities with the way AFRC operates, the OPR will not publish it until all exceptions
  are resolved. OPRs will require justification from AFRC when exception is taken. Send
  unresolved issues to the appropriate Secretariat or Air Staff office for resolution, in
  accordance with AFI 10-301, Responsibilities of Air Reserve Component (ARC) Forces.
 20                                                  AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


   2.4.3. If changes to the publication are made during coordination that may affect the
   applicability to reserve units, the OPR must re-coordinate with AF/RE for departmental
   publications, and AFRC for MAJCOM publications.
   2.4.4. If changes to the applicability publication occur after release (from an interim change
   or a rewrite), AF/RE or AFRC must submit an AF IMT 847 to the OPR of the publication if
   the changes affect the applicability status of the publication. OPRs receiving an AF/RE or an
   AFRC request to change the applicability statement within a publication must comply.
2.5. Applicability of Departmental and Field Publications to the Air National
Guard (ANG):
2.5. (45 SW)Applicability to the Air National Command (ANC). The 45th Space Wing
publishing activity will not issue publications that apply to the ANG. If it is determined this
requirement exists, the local publishing activity will contact AFNIC/EASP for guidance.
   2.5.1. All new and rewritten departmental and MAJCOM publications must be sent to the
   ANG for review. If a lower-level field publication affects the ANG, the publication must be
   routed to ANG for review as part of the technical/functional review. The National Guard
   Bureau (NGB) authorized the ANG to review and approve ANG publications without
   additional NGB review. EXCEPTION: The NGB will review and approve all Interservice
   Publications; however, the process for Air Force OPRs remains the same. All publications
   will be submitted to ang.pubs@me.ngb.army.mil; ANG will ensure Air Force and
   Interservice publications are disseminated to the appropriate reviewers within ANG/NGB.
       2.5.1.1. The ANG determines whether a publication applies, not the authoring OPR.
       NOTE: As the Air Force moves closer to total force functioning, publications should be
       written to support the functioning of all types of Air Force employees/members,
       including ANG forces. However, when the ANG takes exception to specific portions of a
       publication due to dissimilarities with the way ANG operates, the ANG will provide
       applicability or exception statements to the OPR of the publication for inclusion in the
       opening paragraph. OPRs will require justification from the ANG when exception is
       taken. Examples of opening paragraph statements are: "This publication applies to the Air
       National Guard (ANG)," "This publication does not apply to the Air National Guard
       (ANG)," or "This publication applies to the Air National Guard (ANG) only upon
       mobilization."
       2.5.1.2. When an existing ANG and an applicable departmental or MAJCOM publication
       conflict, the ANG publication governs until the OPR and appropriate ANG Chief resolve
       the conflict. Resolve conflicts at the MAJCOM-level by including either an ANG-
       specific chapter or publishing a replacement ANG publication.
       2.5.1.3. If there are numerous exceptions, additions, or inclusions to a proposed
       publication, ANG will publish a separate publication. ANG will publish supplements
       identified as ANG supplements to both departmental and MAJCOM publications, using
       the same numerical designation as the parent publication.
       2.5.1.4. Only the publications listed by series and date in the ANG Master Catalog apply
       to ANG (online at ―http://www.ngbpdc.ngb.army.mil/MasCat/Default.htm‖. The
       ANG OPR notifies the NGB publications manager, through the Director of the Air Guard
       (NGB/CF), of revisions to publications.

2.6. Applicability of Departmental and MAJCOM Publications to the Civil Air Patrol
(CAP). The CAP is the volunteer civilian auxiliary of the United States Air Force. In this
capacity, the CAP performs Air Force missions as approved in the AFPD 10-27, Civil Air Patrol,
and AFI 10-2701, Organization and Function of the Civil Air Patrol. Coordination of
publications relating to noncombat missions is highly encouraged. Approval of policies and
procedures affecting the auxiliary must follow the normal chain of command.
2.7. Types of Publications

Table 2.1. Publications Types and Descriptions.

  Directive publications are necessary to meet the requirements of law, safety, security, or
  other areas where common direction and standardization benefit the Air Force. Air Force
  personnel must comply with these publications. All publications in this category must
  carry the following statement in the publication header: "COMPLIANCE WITH THIS
  PUBLICATION IS MANDATORY."

 Note: The e-Publishing website does not post products below wing/base level, although
 unless otherwise noted in this table all products must be listed in the e-Publishing website
 product index.

           The OPR then completes HAF
           functional and mandatory
           coordination. The OPR shows
           all coordination, including those
           obtained from other Military
           Departments, on the AF Form
           673, and sends one electronic
           copy of the draft along with a
           signed AF Form 673 to AFDPO

           and sends the draft to the Air
           Force functional OPR for
           preliminary coordination. At
           this point, the Air Force OPR
           obtains the publication number
           from AFDPO. After the
           preliminary coordination has
           been returned to and reviewed
           by the lead agent, the updated
           draft is then returned to the Air
           Force OPR for final
           coordination.
          The Air Force OPR obtains and
          shows all coordination on the AF

          authority sign it; and sends the
          approved draft, by memorandum,
          to the lead agent for processing.
          The Air Force OPR works with
          the lead agent to resolve any

           developing a draft). The AF
           OPR develops and processes the
           publication according to this
           Instruction.
           The AF OPR sends a draft to the
           supported component for
           coordination. The supported
           component must provide a
           component specific publication
           number and printing and
           shipping instructions (if
           applicable). The AF OPR works
           with the supported component
           to resolve any differences
           identified during coordination.
           The AF OPR completes
           functional and mandatory
           coordination, then certification
           and approval. The AF OPR
           shows all coordination,
           including those obtained from
           the supported component, on the
           AF Form 673, and sends one
           electronic copy of the draft to
           AFDPO for processing and
           posting onto the e- Publishing
           website. The AF OPR provides
           the supported components OPR
           with a link to the publication on
           the e- Publishing website.
           When the AF is the Supported
           Component: The supporting
           component’s OPR develops and
           formats the publication
           according to their publishing
           procedures and sends the draft
           to the Air Force functional OPR
           for preliminary coordination. At
           this point, the AF OPR obtains a
           publication number from their
           local publications manager and
           provides it along with any
           comments to the supporting
           components OPR. The AF OPR

 NOTES:
 1. Periodicals are no longer recognized as part of the publishing program. Periodicals are
 managed by the author’s functional organization and published on local websites. Newspapers
 and commercial enterprise publications are authorized by and subject to the guidance in AFI
 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures. Local webmasters are responsible for
 ensuring Section 508 compliance.
 2. "Policy Letters", standard memoranda, guides, and bulletins are not recognized as part of the
 publishing program so are not considered official guidance; attempts to issue guidance in
 "policy letters", standard memoranda, guides, or bulletins only create conflicts with official
 guidance. Commanders/Directors must refrain from issuing these types of documents if their
 intent is to require implementation or compliance. Official guidance must be established in a

  maybe directed by the following: Executive Orders (EOs); Public Laws; Federal
  Management Regulations; Office of Management and Budget (OMB) bulletins, circulars, and
  notices; Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR); Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
  regulations; Department of Commerce (DOC) circulars, bulletins, and notices; Federal
  Aviation Administration (FAA) publications; National Institute of Standards and Technology
  (NIST) publications; General Accounting Office (GAO) publications; and others.

              flight, etc., when there is
              insufficient time to process
              and distribute a new or
              revised guidance publication
              (AFI, AFMAN, or AF
              Supplement to a DoDI).
              GMs expire 180 days after
              their effective date or when
              superseded by a guidance
              publication, whichever is
              earlier. OPRs must process
              and distribute a new or
              revised guidance publication
              before the GM expires.
              AFDPO will remove expired
              GMs from the e-Publishing
              website and notify the OPR.

              Only one GM at each level
              shall be active at a time for a
              publication. OPRs will
              consolidate guidance into a
              single GM when additional
              direction must be provided
              and a GM is already active.
              GMs may prescribe forms;
              however, OPRs must also
              complete requirements in
              Chapter 3 of this Instruction
              if the action includes a form
              revision or issues a new form

              GMs will be posted on the e-
              Publishing website. OPRs
              must contact AFDPO to
              obtain a GM control number;
              GMs not revising an existing

              procedures and sends the
              draft to the Air Force
              functional OPR for
              preliminary coordination. At
              this point, the Air Force OPR
              obtains the publication
              number from AFDPO. After
              the preliminary coordination
              has been returned to and
              reviewed by the lead agent,
              the updated draft is then
              returned to the Air Force
              OPR for final coordination.

              The Air Force OPR obtains
              and shows all coordination
              on the AF Form 673; has the
              approval authority sign it;
              and sends the approved draft,
              by memorandum, to the lead
              agent for processing. The Air
              Force OPR works with the
              lead agent to resolve any
              differences identified during
              coordination. The lead
              agent’s publishing activity
              sends a memorandum with a
              30-calendar-day suspense to
              the Air Force OPR
              requesting verification of
              publication number and

              the header of the document
              (see Section 2C for guidance
              on developing a draft). The
              AF OPR develops and
              processes the publication
              according to this Instruction.
              The AF OPR sends a draft to
              the supported component for
              coordination. The supported
              component must provide a
              component specific
              publication number and
              printing and shipping
              instructions (if applicable).
              The AF OPR works with the
              supported component to
              resolve any differences
              identified during
              coordination.

              The AF OPR completes
              functional and mandatory
              coordination, then
              certification and approval.
              The AF OPR shows all
              coordination, including those
              obtained from
              the supported component, on
              the AF Form 673, and sends
              one electronic copy of the
              draft to AFDPO for
              processing and posting onto
              the e-Publishing website.
              The AF OPR provides the
              supported components OPR
              with a link to the publication
              on the e-Publishing website.

                                          this point, the AF OPR
                                          obtains a publication number
                                          from their local publications

                                          component to resolve any
                                          differences identified during
                                          coordination. The supporting
                                          component’s publishing
                                          activity notifies the AF OPR

                                          to the published version. The
                                          AF OPR must send the link
                                          to AFDPO for release on the

                                                 and other places. OPRs should
                                                 combine and issue VAs at the
                                                 highest levels, when possible.

             publication; there is no need
             to list VAs in the related
             publication, but OPRs must
             indicate the related
             publication number on the
             VA; e.g., ―AFVA11-240 (Per
             AFI11-218)‖ or ―AMCVA90-
             301 (Per AFI 90-301).‖
             Publications/forms managers
             assign control numbers, which
             are under the same subject
             series and carry the same first
             digit of the control number as
             the associated publication.

             inform or motivate, such as a
             poster promoting safe driving.
             As a rule, limit display to
             180-calendar days or less.
             Show an expiration date in
             small type at the bottom of the
             VA; e.g., ―Expires 30 May
             2009. If the VA shows the
             date of an event, you may
             eliminate the expiration date.
             AFDPO does not support the
             development or dissemination
             of temporary VAs; OPRs
             must develop temporary VAs
             independently, in conjunction
             with the local graphics office,
             the Document Automation
             Production Service (DAPS),
             etc. Temporary VAs do not
             require prescribing
             publications, numbers,
             indexing, coordination, or
             maintenance of a record set,
             and will not be listed on the e-

NOTES:

1. Periodicals are no longer recognized as part of the publishing program. Periodicals are
managed by the author’s functional organization and published on local websites. Newspapers
and commercial enterprise publications are authorized by and subject to the guidance in AFI 35-
101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures. Local webmasters are responsible for ensuring
Section 508 compliance.

2. ―Policy Letters‖, standard memoranda, guides, and bulletins are not recognized as part of the
publishing program so are not considered official guidance; attempts to issue guidance in
―policy letters, standard memoranda, guides, or bulletins only create conflicts with official
guidance. Commanders/Directors must refrain from issuing these types of documents if their
intent is to require implementation or compliance. Official guidance must be established in a
publication type described in this Instruction and processed accordingly.

3. Some non-DoD publications issued by an external agency or entity direct action within the Air
Force. Generally, non-DoD publications are directed to the Office of the Secretary of Defense
and re-delegated within DoD publications, memorandums, etc. Air Force action maybe directed
by the following: Executive Orders (EOs); Public Laws; Federal Management Regulations;
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) bulletins, circulars, and notices; Federal Acquisition
Regulations (FAR); Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations; Department of
Commerce (DOC) circulars, bulletins, and notices; Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
publications; National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publications; General
Accounting Office (GAO) publications; and others.

4. Unless otherwise noted in this table, all publications and forms must be listed on the e-
Publishing website. Classified and FOUO publications and forms must be listed under an
unclassified title.

Section 2B—Developing a Publication

2.8. Content Limitations and Restrictions.
    2.8.1. Only civilian employees (including direct-hire foreign national employees, but not
    including contractors or indirect-hire foreign national employees) and/or military members of
    the Air Force are authorized to serve as the POC for, provide coordination on, certify, and /or
    approve official Air Force publications and forms, including interservice publications where
    the Air Force serves as the lead service.
    2.8.2. AFPDs and AF supplements to DODDs may only be directly implemented by AFIs
    and AFMANs. DOD Issuances may only be directly supplemented or implemented by a
    department-level publication. Unless otherwise noted in the opening paragraph, all other
    publications may be supplemented. EXCEPTION: If no departmental-level guidance is
    provided (e.g., AFIs, AFMANs, etc.), field activities may issue field instructions to directly
    implement AFPDs and AF supplements to DODDs. Once higher headquarters guidance is
    published, the field activity must rescind its instruction and issue a supplement to the higher
    headquarters guidance.
AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                                 67


   2.8.3. A publication applies only to the issuing headquarters’ staff elements and its
   subordinate activities (i.e. an AFI issued at the HAF applies Air Force-wide; an AFMCI
   applies only to AFMC and units subordinate to AFMC; an AMC supplement applies only to
   AMC and units subordinate to AMC).
   2.8.4. Implementing Technical Orders (T.O.). If authorized by T.O. managers, process
   MAJCOM and base-level T.O. supplements through your supporting publication function.
   AFPD 21-3, Technical Orders, and T.O. 00-5-1, Air Force Technical Order System, contain
   special instructions and limitations on issuing supplements.
   2.8.5. When a higher headquarters publication is updated (either by an interim change or a
   rewrite), implementing publications (such as supplements) must be rewritten, updated, or, if
   applicable, certified as current within 180 days (see paragraphs 2.22.3 and 2.24.1 on
   certifying a publication as current). Publications/forms managers may use the AF Form 399
   to alert OPRs of changes to higher headquarters publications. Publishing managers will fill
   out the top half of the form, using the "special instructions" block to tell the OPR how to
   access the publication and to note the type of action taken on the higher headquarters
   publication (e.g., revised, rescinded, amended using a GM, etc.). OPRs will fill out the
   bottom half in response. An AF Form 673 must accompany any final requests for action by
   the OPR. Implementing publications not updated within 180 days will be removed from the
   e-Publishing website, and the publications manager will be notified. NOTE: If the
   implementingpublicationconflictswiththehigherheadquarterspublication, the implementing
   publication must immediately be rescinded and removed from the website. OPRs may issue a
   GM to replace the conflicting publication, or add new guidance to non-conflicting
   implementing publications while the publication is under revision. GMs used to replace or
   amend implementing publications will expire when the supplement is revised (must be within
   180 days). Expired GMs—those exceeding 180 days—will be removed from the e-
   Publishing website and the publications manager will be notified. NOTE: "Policy letters,"
   guides, and bulletins are not recognized as part of the publishing program; any guidance or
   information issued in a policy letter, guide, or bulletin requiring implementation/compliance
   must be established in a publication type described in this instruction and processed
   accordingly.
   2.8.6. Do not put the following in your publication:
       2.8.6.1. Articles intended only to encourage or obtain the support of persons outside the
       Government.
       2.8.6.2. Editorials, book reviews, or articles that are political, representing clear attempts
       to lobby for or against legislation or increased appropriations.
       2.8.6.3. Partisan political campaign articles or editorials.
2.9. Supplements. In order to minimize the release of conflicting guidance and duplicate
information, Air Force activities add organization-specific guidance to higher headquarters
publications by issuing supplements to implement higher headquarters publications, rather than
issuing separate publications (see Table 2.1). Supplementary guidance cannot be less restrictive
than the basic publication, but it can be more restrictive. Supplementary guidance must not
contradict the basic publication.
68                                                   AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


2.9. (45 SW)Supplements. Issue only one supplement for each publication being
supplemented.
  2.9.1. Supplementing Air Force Publications. Field supplements may either be issued as
  an integrated publication or as a "standalone" publication. The integrated method, where
  local content is inserted into the higher headquarters publication, enables the user to see
  higher headquarters and new material in one integrated file—OPRs are strongly encouraged
  to utilize this format, as it is most convenient for readers. The standalone method only
  includes supplementary material; users will have to read standalone supplements alongside
  the higher headquarters publication. If an integrated supplement is produced, that version will
  be posted to the e-Publishing website; if no integrated version is produced, the standalone
  version will be posted to the e-Publishing website. The supplement will be submitted the
  same way, regardless of what format the OPR selects; AFDPO will integrate the
  supplementary material with the higher headquarters publication, or not, based on the OPR’s
  request as stated on the AF Form 673 (block 32). NOTE: If the OPR fails to specify a
  particular format, an integrated version will be produced.
  2.9.1. (45 SW) Supplements for 45th Space Wing publications follow the same criteria as
  for 45th Space Wing publications. Only one supplement may be issued at any one given
  level. OPRs from different functional areas having input need to work together to produce
  one mutually combined supplement. Subordinate units do not supplement 45th Space Wing
  publications.
     2.9.1.1. AFPDs, AF supplements to DODDs, and AFPMs may not be supplemented.
     DOD Issuances may not be directly supplemented in the field, because a direct
     supplement carries the same weight as a departmental publication. Unless otherwise
     stated in the opening paragraph, all other publications may be supplemented.
     EXCEPTION: If no departmental-level guidance is provided (e.g. AFIs, AFMANs, etc.),
     commands may issue command instructions to directly implement AFPDs and AF
     supplements to DODDs. Once higher headquarters guidance is published, the command
     must rescind its instruction and issue a supplement to the higher headquarters guidance.
     2.9.1.2. Follow guidance starting at paragraph 2.12 to format your supplement.
         2.9.1.2.1. In addition to formatting requirements established in 2.12, the following
         applies to supplements: insert the name of the activity followed by the word
         "supplement" below the short title of the publication (e.g., Air Force Supplement, Air
         Mobility Command Supplement, 21st Space Wing Supplement). Create the
         publication header, an opening statement, and a summary of changes (if applicable)
         as mandated in paragraph 2.12 and place before the higher headquarters
         publication’s header. Integrated supplements will also show the header for the higher
         headquarters publication; the header for the higher headquarters publication will
         remain unchanged, including the Seal and the publication date. Contact AFDPO-PPP
         for a sample formatted supplement.
         2.9.1.2.2. OPRs of standalone supplements must identify the higher headquarters
         publication in the opening paragraph and direct users to read the standalone
         supplement in conjunction with the publication being supplemented. OPRs are
         responsible for ensuring they are supplementing the current version of the higher
         headquarters publication.
AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                                   69


       2.9.1.3. Supplements must bear the higher headquarters designator and number, adding
       the field acronym and "SUP" to the end (e.g., AFI33-360_AMCSUP, AFI33-
       360_AMCSUP_89AWSUP, AFI33-360_89AWSUP (if AMC does not issue a
       supplement)). Publications/forms managers will approve numbers before processing the
       final publication.
   2.9.2. Supplementing DoD Publications. See AFI 90-101 for more guidance on Air Force
   implementation of DoD Issuances.
       2.9.2.1. Obtain an electronic file of the DoD material from the OPR or the Washington
       Headquarters Services (WHS) website (http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/) and insert
       the Air Force supplementary material. Classified publications are located on the WHS
       SIPRNet website (http://www.dtic.smil.mil/whs/directives/index.html).
       2.9.2.2. Copy the DoD material word for word, without editing and retaining the
       paragraph numbering and formatting. Do not integrate added text into the DoD text since
       this would be considered editing the DoD text. Added Air Force material must meet
       standards in this Instruction. DoD text should be in regular font, with Air Force text in
       bold font; state that DoD text appears in regular font and Air Force text appears in bold
       font in the opening paragraph.
       2.9.2.3. AF supplements to DOD Issuances will be identified by both the DOD Issuance
       number and an AF publication number, in that order. AF supplements to DODDs will be
       assigned an AFPD number, AF supplements to DODIs will be assigned an AFI number,
       AF supplements to DOD Regulations or Manuals will be assigned an AFMAN number
       (e.g. DODD 8000.1_AFPD33-1). Show this on the cover, if used, and in the upper right
       corner of the title page.
       2.9.2.4. Following guidance in paragraph 2.12, insert the Air Force publication header,
       including the opening paragraph and the summary of changes, if applicable, before the
       original DOD material. The DOD material must remain unchanged, including the DOD
       front matter (the Seal, title, publication date, etc.). Also identify the DOD publication you
       are supplementing in the opening paragraph.
          2.9.2.4.1. OPRs for AF supplements to DOD issuances must format their own
          publication header (paragraph 2.12) and provide AFDPO, the publishing manager
          for departmental publications generated at the HAF, with a .pdf file of the integrated
          supplement for posting. Contact AFDPO (AFDPO-PPP@pentagon.af.mil) for
          sample front matter.
       2.9.2.5. OPRs must place "(Added)(AF)" before supplementary material of any type
       (paragraphs, chapters, tables, attachments, etc.), with the exception of front matter
       material; e.g., "(Added)(AF) Within HAF . . ." OPRs must include added material
       (chapters, main paragraphs, figures, etc.) in the table of contents, if used.
2.10. Select a Subject Series. All Air Force publications are related to an Air Force specialty
code (AFSC); see Attachment 3 for descriptions. NOTE: All directive departmental
publications that issue guidance must have an antecedent AFPD, AF supplement to a DODD, or
AFPM.
   2.10.1. If the publication is new, select the series that most closely describes the function.
70                                                  AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


  2.10.2. If the publication is a rewrite, it bears the same series and control number as the
  superseded publication. If the publication implements an existing Air Force publication, it
  carries the same series number as the higher headquarters publication.
  2.10.3. If you are consolidating two or more publications, either use one of the publication
  numbers and supersede both, or request a new control number and supersede both. NOTE: If
  you are consolidating publications, you must "own" them all or have written concurrence on
  the consolidation from the owning organization. Ensure the statement of concurrence clearly
  indicates the organization that will own the consolidated publication. Also ensure that any
  implementing/supplementary publications are updated (via IC or rewrite) to show the new
  publication number if the series or number of the parent publication changes.
  2.10.4. Departmental. Once you have identified your series, AFDPO will create and assign
  a unique publication control number. If the publication will become a physical (printed)
  product and has a separate cover, place the series number and title on the cover as well as on
  the first page of the publication.
     2.10.4.1. AFPMs and GMs not revising an existing policy or guidance publication will
     be numbered consecutively under the appropriate subject series (e.g., AFPM33-01). An
     AFPM or GM revising an existing publication will carry the existing publication’s
     number followed by the appropriate acronym and number (e.g., the first AFPM revising
     AFPD33-3 would be numbered AFPD33-3_AFPM01, the second would be numbered
     AFPD33-3_AFPM02, etc.). Publication Managers remove expired or superseded AFPMs
     and GMs from circulation. AFPMs and GMs may be reissued if the policy/guidance has
     not been incorporated into an official publication within the timeframe allowed. OPRs
     shall re-coordinate using an AF Form 673, obtaining certifier and approvers signatures
     for the subsequent reissue. The new AFPM or GM number will be sequenced to reflect
     the subsequent reissue. See Attachment 4 for AFPM and GM examples that issue new
     and existing policy/guidance.
     2.10.4.2. Publications implementing a particular AFPD or AF supplement to a DoDD
     should fall in the same numbered series and have a three-digit control number (e.g. AFI
     65-701 is the first publication that implements AFPD 65-7). Publications that
     follow/support the implementing publication will have consecutive control numbers (e.g.
     AFI 33-360 will further be implemented by AFMAN 33-361).
     2.10.4.3. Air Force supplements to DOD Issuances will bear the DOD number and an
     Air Force publication number (e.g. DODD 8000.1_AFPD 33-1; DODI 1000.15_AFI 34-
     223).
  2.10.5. Field (MAJCOM/FOA/DRU/Base/Wing). Once the series has been identified, the
  publications/forms manager assigns the control number. Field publications will be numbered
  consecutively under the subject series using at least a 3-digit control number (some
  publications will have a 4-digit control number).
  2.10.5. (45 SW) Selecting a Series Number. At the 45th Space Wing, publication numbers
  are assigned to new publications by the publications management office, 45 SCS/SCOKC,
  after all coordination is completed.
     2.10.5.1. GMs issuing new guidance that will not be incorporated into an existing
     publication will be numbered consecutively under the appropriate subject series (e.g.,
AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                                 71


       ACCGM33 -01, AFMCGM33-01, etc.). A GM that amends an existing publication will
       carry the amended publication’s number followed by the appropriate acronym and
       number (e.g., the first GM that issues guidance amending AFI33-360__ACCSUP would
       be numbered AFI33-360_ACCSUP_ACCGM1, the second to amend AFI33 -360 _
       ACCSUP would be numbered AFI33-360_ACCSUP_ACCGM2, etc.).
       2.10.5.2. Supplements must bear the higher headquarters designator and number, adding
       the field acronym to the end and "SUP" (e.g., AFI33-360_AMCSUP, AFI33-
       360_AMCSUP_89AWSUP,AFI33-360_89AWSUP(if AMC does not issue a
       supplement)).
2.11. Select a Title. When developing a new publication, select a meaningful, concise title. Use
only commonly known abbreviations, such as "US." Do not use terms such as "policy,"
"instruction," "guidance," "handbook," "pamphlet," "catalog," "guide," or "book," etc., in the title
for that type of publication. If supplementing a higher headquarters publication at the HAF or in
the field, maintain the title of the original publication.
2.12. Format the Draft. Drafts are for development and coordination only, not for
implementation or compliance. Drafts may be circulated to inform users of forthcoming changes,
but OPRs may never release draft content with instructions to comply. Users are not required to
comply until content is certified, approved, and posted/released. Each draft must be marked
"DRAFT"—"NOT FOR IMPLEMENTATION OR COMPLIANCE" across the top of each
page. Reference, the GPO Style Manual (http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/index.html),
and DoDI 5025.01, DOD Directives Program, for additional guidance on writing style,
grammar, formatting, etc. See paragraph 2.25.2.3 for guidance on formatting ICs and
paragraph 2.26 for guidance on formatting ACs.
   2.12.1. Content in publications must be structured in this order: publication header,
   opening paragraph; summary of changes (if applicable); table of contents (if applicable—
   see paragraph 2.12.1.1); “overview” or “ background” information; detailed
   responsibilities; core content; attachments (if the OPR intends to include a list of
   references, definitions for abbreviations and acronyms, a glossary, and/or a description of
   terms, that information will be placed in Attachment 1, which will be titled "Glossary of
   References and Supporting Information").
       2.12.1.1. Table of Contents. Tables of contents for electronic publications that are
       processed by AFDPO and posted on the e-Publishing website will be generated by
       AFDPO for publications that are 20 pages or more; do not submit a table of contents as
       part of the draft publication unless the publication will be a physical/printed product.
       OPRs for physical/printed publications should consider adding a table of contents for
       publications over 20 pages. Include chapter titles, section titles, sub-section titles as
       desired, titles for figures or tables that appear within chapters, and attachments titles, as
       well as page numbers for all.
   2.12.2. Create your draft using Word® in 12-point Times New Roman font, with one-inch
   top, bottom, left, and right margins. Include page numbers on draft publications.
   2.12.3. Embed figures, tables, and illustrations where they will appear in the final version.
   Also provide a separate source graphic file for each figure, table, or illustration not created in
   Word®. Place the number and title of each figure, table, illustration, etc., above the item in
72                                                  AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


  the publication. Limit the use of unnecessary color and graphics to help keep the size of
  transmitted and posted files down. Work with your publications/forms manager to ensure
  your graphics are submitted properly.
  2.12.4. Paragraph Numbering. Numerically number all paragraphs and subparagraphs,
  using this publication as a visual sample for paragraph numbering. AF Supplements to DoD
  Issuances will follow the numbering format of the supplemented DoD issuance. OPRs must
  provide fully integrated camera ready copies of AF Supplements to DoD issuances to
  AFDPO for posting to the e-Publishing website. Do not use the automatic numbering feature
  in Word®—paragraphs must be manually numbered. The formatting software used by the
  Air Force cannot process documents that have been numbered automatically. NOTE: All
  paragraphs and subparagraphs should be flush left in the draft. The correct indentation will
  be applied when the publication is formatted.
     2.12.4.1. Field Supplements. Submit only the material to be added to the higher
     headquarters publication including the paragraph numbers whether creating a standalone
     or integrated supplement. AFDPO will insert the new material into the higher
     headquarters publication for integrated supplements, and provide the OPR a copy of the
     final product.
         2.12.4.1.1. When drafting supplementary guidance, field OPRs must insert "added"
         between each new paragraph, figure, table, attachment number, etc., and the content
         (e.g., "4.1.1. (Added)"). The formatting software adds the appropriate field acronym
         after "(Added)". HAF OPRs must insert "(Added)" and "(AF)" between each new
         number and the content (e.g., "4.1.1. (Added)(AF)") when supplementing a DOD
         publication.
         2.12.4.1.2. Do not duplicate paragraph, figure, table, or attachment numbers already
         in the basic publication when adding information in a standalone or an integrated
         supplement. HAF OPRs writing an AF supplement to a DOD issuance will start with
         the next number, or a sub-number if inserting between existing content. Field OPRs
         writing a supplement to a higher Air Force publication will repeat the number of the
         paragraph being supplemented and insert "(Added)", as specified in the previous
         paragraph. When the correct acronym is inserting during processing, the whole phrase
         "4.1.1 (Added)AMC") is considered a unique identifier even though the numerical
         digits exactly match the paragraph number being supplemented. Numbering must
         agree with the format in the basic publication; e.g., publications with chapters:
         Figure 2.1, Table 3.1, etc.; without chapters: Figure 1, Table 1, etc.
     2.12.4.2. Bullets. Bullets are not authorized in directive type Air Force publications (see
     Table 2.1 for list of publications), including interim changes. When updating an old
     publication with bulleted information, those items must be substituted with paragraph
     numbers (e.g. 2.14.1.1., 2.14.1.2., etc.). EXCEPTION: When part of a numbered
     paragraph, bullets may be used for simple lists in non-directive type Air Force
     publications (AFPAM, DD, TTP, AFH, VA). Sub-bullets are not allowed.
  2.12.5. Publication Header. The following information must be included as part of the
  publication header (see the first page of this document as an example for content, not
  format):
AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                            73


     2.12.5.1. The Air Force Seal or corresponding Shield of the MAJCOM/FOA/DRU where
     the publication is approved will be inserted during tagging—OPRs do not need to include
     the Seal or Shield in the draft publication. All departmental publications will display the
     Air Force Seal in the upper left corner of the first page, with "BY ORDER OF THE
     SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE" written above the Seal. Field publications will not
     use the Air Force Seal, unless issuing an integrated supplement to a departmental
     publication. All field publications, except integrated supplements to departmental
     publications, will display the appropriate MAJCOM/FOA/DRU Shield in the upper left
     corner of the first page, with "BY ORDER OF THE [MAJCOM/FOA/DRU]
     COMMANDER or DIRECTOR" written above the Shield. NOTE: MAJCOMs may
     approve subordinate organizations to use their unique Shield on their site specific
     publications. However, MAJCOM Publication Managers must ensure an electronic copy
     of the approved Shield is provided to AFDPO for the publications they process.
     2.12.5.2. Publications not processed by AFDPO must be formatted by the OPR to look
     like an AFDPO formatted publication (camera ready).OPRs are required to use the
     information detailed below to create publications (contact AFDPO to obtain standard
     templates of publications). Draft publications (both physical and electronic) that will be
     processed by AFDPO must contain the following information at the beginning of the
     document in this order, flush left and single spaced:
        2.12.5.2.1. BY ORDER OF THE [SECAF/command/base/wing/etc.];
        2.12.5.2.2. The publication type and number (e.g. Air Force Instruction 33-360, Air
        Force Instruction 33-360_AMC);
        2.12.5.2.3. Place holder for date (e.g., "[Date]"). The final publishing activity
        (AFDPO, local publication manager, or OPR) will date the publication the same day
        it is posted to the website or made available for distribution. The publication date is
        the effective date; Air Force publications are not considered effective until they are
        released to users IAW this Instruction. Publication dates assigned by AFDPO cannot
        exceed seven (7) business days after the publications/forms manager receives
        complete and correct materials from the OPR. With proper justification publications
        at any level may be assigned an "effective" date that falls in the future, but under no
        circumstances may publications be backdated;
        2.12.5.2.4. The AFSC series title;
        2.12.5.2.5. The publication title;
        2.12.5.2.6. The compliance statement : "COMPLIANCE                      WITH      THIS
        PUBLICATION IS MANDATORY" if a directive publication;
        2.12.5.2.6. (45 SW) Directive Publications. The banner statement ―COMPLIANCE
        WITH THIS PUBLICATION IS MANDATORY‖ is required on all 45th Space Wing
        directive publications.
        2.12.5.2.7. An accessibility statement to identify where the publication is located for
        distribution. Examples of accessibility statements include "ACCESSIBILITY:
        Publications and forms are available for downloading or ordering on the e-Publishing
        website at www.e-Publishing.af.mil"; "ACCESSIBILITY: This publication is only
74                                                AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


     available directly from the OPR"; ACCESSIBILITY: This publication is available for
     downloading on the SIPRNet at www.#######.af.smil.mil‖;
     2.12.5.2.8. A releasability statement, which should specify any limitations on
     distribution. Examples of releasability statements include "RELEASABILITY:
     There are no releasability restrictions on this publication"; "RELEASABILITY:
     Access to this publication [or form] is restricted: this publication may be released to
     NATO members only"; "RELEASABILITY: Access to this publication [or form] is
     restricted: this publication may not bere leased to foreign nationals";
     "RELEASABILITY: Access to this publication [or form] is restricted: this
     publication is classified/FOUO; requests for accessibility must be approved by the
     OPR," etc. Unless there are no releasability restrictions on the publication, the
     statement must be prefaced with the phrase "RELEASABILITY: Access to this
     publication [or form] is restricted";
     2.12.5.2.8. (45 SW) Certifying Releasability of Publications. The OPR must
     conduct a releasability certification for each publication they want disseminated
     through an official publishing dissemination medium (e.g., official web repository,
     AF Publishing Distribution Center (AFDPC), or any future dissemination medium).
     The releasability certification will be documented on the AF Form 673 and must
     include: level of releasability (public access or restricted access); statement of the
     restriction, if applicable, and justification for limited release. Mandatory coordination
     consists of the following: Foreign Disclosure Office (45 SW/FDO); Privacy Act (PA)
     Office (45 SCS/SCX); Freedom of Information Act Office (FOIA) (45 SCS/SCX);
     Operations Security (OPSEC) Manager (45 SW/OPSEC); Public Affairs Office (45
     SW/PA). Certifying signature of the organizational content approval authority must
     be O-5 or above.
     2.12.5.2.9. "OPR: [office symbol only]";
     2.12.5.2.10. "Certified By: [insert office symbol and, in parenthesis, the certifier’s
     name that will appear in blocks 18 and 19 of the AF Form 673]";
     2.12.5.2.11. "Supersedes: [include the number and date of all publications being
     superseded, separated by a semicolon]"; and,
     2.12.5.2.12. "Pages: [insert page count]".
     2.12.5.2.13. AFPMs and GMs. OPRs writing an AFPM or GM will format their
     document using Attachment 4 as a guide. AFPMs and GMs will indicate in the
     subject line whether it is an Air Force Policy Memorandum or Guidance
     Memorandum. OPRs request AFGM and GM control numbers from publication
     managers and place it above the date slot. The actual date on the AFPM or GM is
     inserted at the time of publishing by the publishing authority. If issuing new policy or
     guidance, include a releasability statement, applicability statement, the standard
     records set statement (see paragraph 2.12.7.2) and any other applicable standard
     statements described in paragraph 2.12.7. NOTE: Do not have the principle sign the
     actual memorandum; insert an authentication/signature block just like any other
     publication. The completed AF Form 673 serves as the approval to publish.
        2.12.5.2.13.1. If issuing an AFPM or a GM (HAF or field level) that amends an
AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                           75


            existing publication, insert the following standard statement as the opening
            statement: ―This is a [Guidance or Policy]Memorandum immediately
            implementing changes to [specify the publication and include a short description
            of the policy/guidance being changed]. Compliance with this memorandum is
            mandatory. To the extent its directions are inconsistent with other Air Force
            publications, the information herein prevails, in accordance with AFI33-360,
            Publications and Forms Management.
            2.12.5.2.13.2. AFPMs and all GMs (HAF and field level) will end with the
            following statement: "The directions of this memorandum become void after 180
            days have elapsed from the date of this memorandum, or upon publication of an
            Interim Change or rewrite of the affected publication, whichever is earlier."
            NOTE: AFPMs and GMs may be reissued if the policy/guidance has not been
            incorporated into an official publication within the timeframe allowed. OPRs shall
            re-coordinate using an AF Form 673, obtaining certifier and approvers signatures
            for the subsequent reissue. The new AFPM or GM number will be sequenced to
            reflect the subsequent reissue. The OPR will forward AFPM or GM and AF Form
            673 to AFDPO for dating/posting.
         2.12.5.2.14. There are a few exceptions and additions to the above formatting
         requirements for certain publication types:
            2.12.5.2.14.1. OPRs writing supplements should refer to paragraph 2.9 for
            additional guidance on formatting supplements.
            2.12.5.2.14.2. List the publication type and number, a releasability statement (no
            need for an accessibility statement), and a supersession line on permanent VAs;
            this information should be placed at the bottom right of the VA if space allows. In
            some cases, placement of this information will be impossible due to small size of
            the VA; OPRs should try to design VAs to include this information unless doing
            so is impractical.
  2.12.6. Summary of Changes. A summary of changes is mandatory for all ICs and
  rewritten publications. The summary of changes cites major changes: content changes; new,
  revised, or obsolete forms; new, revised, or rescinded recurring reports; etc. Place the
  summary of changes immediately after the opening paragraph. Include one of these
  statements as the last sentence when making an IC (not when issuing a rewrite): "A margin
  bar (|) indicates newly revised material.", or "An asterisk (*) indicates newly revised
  material" for Supplements to DoD Issuances. NOTE: Do not include a summary of changes
  for ACs or new publications.
     2.12.6.1. Forewords. Only nondirective publications may have a foreword to provide a
     personal message from a proponent. Limit the foreword to one unnumbered page
     preceding the title (first) page. Publications containing forewords must include a cover.
     Signatures are not required on forewords.
  2.12.7. Opening Paragraph. Write a concise purpose statement for all categories of
  publications: explain what the publication covers, who must comply, and cite the antecedent
  publication(s). Include additional statements referencing applicability to the ANG and the
  Reserves—see paragraphs 2.4 and 2.5 for guidance. Do not include policy/guidance
76                                                  AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


  statements in the opening paragraph. If implementing a DoD publication, show the type
  implemented after "DoD" (e.g., DoD Directive or DoD Instruction) and include the number
  and title.
  2.12.7. (45 SW) Purpose statements are required for all publications except visual aids
  (VA), directories, inventories, catalogs, digests and handbooks.
     2.12.7.1. Legal Requirements. If applicable, note that failure to comply with the
     publication is punishable as a violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice
     (UCMJ). Indicate if the publication is subject to the Privacy Act (PA) of 1974, subject to
     Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requirements, contains copyrighted information, or
     is subject to other statutory requirements. See Section 2C for guidance on obtaining
     sample statements and addressing legal issues in the opening paragraph of the
     publication. Closely coordinate opening paragraphs with your servicing legal office.
     2.12.7.2. Include the standard records management statement: "Ensure that all records
     created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
     accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and
     disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Information Management System
     (AFRIMS)        Records         Disposition      Schedule        (RDS)       located     at
     https://www.my.af.mil/gcssaf61a/afrims/afrims/". Additionally, if the publication
     generates a report(s), alert readers in a statement and cite all applicable Reports Control
     Numbers in accordance with AFI33-324.
        2.12.7.2.1. Per AFI 33-324, an internal report includes data or information collected
        by one or more organizational components and transmitted to other organizational
        components for management purposes. A public report includes collections of
        information that require responses from the public. See AFI 33-324 for more
        thorough definitions.
     2.12.7.3. Include a statement for recommending changes, including any necessary
     routing instructions. For example, "Refer recommended changes and questions about this
     publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847,
     Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through
     the appropriate functional’s chain of command."
     2.12.7.4. Include a statement in the opening paragraph as to whether or not field
     activities must send implementing or supplementing publications to the higher
     headquarters functional OPR for review and coordination before publishing. OPRs are
     highly encouraged to review lower-level supplements for conflicting material, less
     restrictive guidance, and for possible incorporation into the higher headquarters
     publication. Examples of statements include, "This publication may be supplemented at
     any level, but all direct Supplements must be routed to the OPR of this publication for
     coordination prior to certification and approval." or "This publication may not be
     supplemented."
     2.12.7.5. Include a statement in the opening paragraph if the OPR determines that no
     waivers may be granted for any part of the publication.
AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                                77


2.13. Citing References. NOTE: See Attachment 2 for sample citation styles and formats.
   2.13.1. Limit the use of references and ensure all references are directly applicable and listed
   in Attachment 1. Do not use indefinite references such as "in current directives," "contained
   in existing instructions," and "as prescribed in pertinent publications." Official Air Force
   policy and/or guidance are issued in the publications described in Table 2.1. Therefore, do
   not reference the following: a draft publication; unofficial policy and/or guidance found on
   websites; or classified information in an unclassified publication.
   2.13.2. When Executive Orders (EOs), Public Laws, or other statutes have already been
   implemented by a DOD Issuance, use the DOD Issuance as the reference citation; e.g., use
   "DODD 5400.7" rather than "Title 5 United States Code Section 552." NOTE: "DOD
   Issuances" include Department of Defense Directives (DODD), DOD Instructions (DODI),
   other DOD publications, and their changes. However, when an Air Force publication directly
   implements a specific statute, you must cite it accordingly. Use codified citations (United
   States Code) when available, and if the provision is not codified, use the Public Law citation;
   e.g., use Public Law 98-191, or Title 41 United States Code Sections 401-420. Verify proper
   statutory authority with the servicing legal office during coordination of the publication.
       2.13.2.1. Do not reference a DoD Issuance in an Air Force publication unless there is no
       Air Force implementing publication. Use the Issuances, Delegations of Authority, and
       Responsibilities (IDAR) Database (www.idar.hq.af.mil) to cross reference Air Force
       publications with DoD Issuances. If no Air Force publication, cite the DoD Issuance
       number and include the full reference (designator, number, title, and date) in Attachment
       1.
   2.13.3. To refer to another Air Force publication and/or form, cite the designator, number,
   and include the title in italics at first use (e.g., AFI 33-322, Records Management Program;
   AF Form 673, Air Force Publication/Form Action Request). Thereafter, refer only to the
   designator and number (e.g., AFI 33-322 or AF Form 673). Include the full publication
   reference (designator, number, title, and date) in Attachment 1.
   2.13.4. OPRs may use "notes" within a paragraph to explain or highlight information. The
   word "Note," should be in bold followed by a colon (e.g., NOTE: [insert additional text]).
   Notes associated with tables, figures, or illustrations should be placed immediately below the
   graphic or, in the case of a table, in the last row.
   2.13.5. Use footnotes or endnotes to credit a lengthy legal cite, a copyright owner, the source
   of quoted materials, or provide a lengthy explanation/expansion on text within a paragraph.
   Endnotes must be placed before any attachments to the publication.
2.14. Using Illustrations.
   2.14.1. Requirements of Government Printing and Binding Regulations are as follows: Use
   illustrations only when they relate to Air Force business and are in the public interest, relate
   directly to the subject matter, are in good taste, and are the smallest size necessary. Limit the
   use of color, especially when developing a publication that will be printed, to control the
   cost. Use of color on printed materials must be justified on the AF Form 673.
   2.14.2. Embed figures, tables not created in Word®, and illustrations where they will appear
   in the final version. Place the caption above the graphic. Provide a separate source graphic
 78                                                       AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


   file for each figure, table, or illustration not created in Word® (e.g., .tif, .gif, .jpg, etc.). Work
   with your publications/ forms manager to ensure your graphics are submitted properly
2.15. Tables. Use tables to clarify procedures, present data, and/or to explain a choice of
actions or set of conditions.

Figure 2.1. Elements of a Publication.




   2.15.1. A standard table is data arranged in columns. The listed items are organized by some
   criterion such as alphabetical or numerical order. The format requirements for standard tables
   are not rigid; many variations are possible, depending on the kind of material you wish to
   place in a table. Regardless of the variation used, columns and rows should be labeled (titles,
   numbers, letters, etc.) to facilitate referencing material in the table. Tables found in
   Attachment 2 and Attachment 3 of this publication are examples of standard tables.
   2.15.2. A decision logic table (DLT) is most useful when you need to explain a set of actions
   that depend on a condition or set of conditions; or when a narrative description of possible
AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                              79


   actions would be complex or wordy. There are three elements in DLTs: conditions, actions,
   and rules. The conditions (the ifs in the if-then relationship) are the potential circumstances
   that influence decisions. The actions (the thens in the if-then relationship) are the specific
   operations or tasks that must be performed when the various conditions occur. The rules are
   the combined conditions and actions that make up decisions (if + then = rule). Each separate
   condition and action must have its own rule. Table 2.2 and Table 2.3 in this instruction are
   examples of DLTs.
   2.15.3. A specified action table (SAT) shows actions that are usually taken in a certain order
   but that do not depend on any condition. If you just want to show a series of related actions
   or procedures, use a SAT. Table 1.1 in this instruction is an example of an SAT.
2.16. Doctrine Documents. Refer to AFI 10-1301, Air and Space Doctrine, for guidance on
developing doctrine. Command activities may not issue command doctrine documents, nor may
they supplement AFDDs. The OPR for doctrine is the Curtis E. LeMay Center for Doctrine
Development and Education (formerly known as AFDC) at Maxwell AFB, Alabama. Contact
LeMay Center regarding the format for 1- and 2-series doctrine documents. The format is similar
to joint doctrine publications.
   2.16.1. Basic doctrine (AFDD 1, Air Force Basic Doctrine) states the most fundamental and
   enduring beliefs that describe and guide the proper use of air and space power in military
   operations. Basic doctrine is the foundation of all air and space power doctrine. Because of
   its fundamental and enduring character, basic doctrine provides broad and continuing
   guidance on how forces are prepared and employed.
   2.16.2. Operational doctrine (2 series doctrine documents) applies the principles of basic
   doctrine to operational actions by describing the proper use of air and space power in the
   context of distinct objectives, force capabilities, and operational environments. Operational
   doctrine describes how the Air Force executes its missions, and it anticipates changes and
   influences that may affect military operations, such as technological advances.
   2.16.3. Tactical doctrine (3-series tactics, techniques, and procedures [TTP]) applies basic
   and operational doctrine to military actions by describing the proper use of specific weapon
   systems or detailed TTPs, to accomplish specific military operations. TTP publications that
   are approved for use by the Air Force and at least one other Service are formatted similar to
   joint doctrine publications.
       2.16.3.1. (DELETED)
       2.16.3.2. AFTTPs are Air Force-level publications subordinate to Air Force doctrine
       documents. They are certified by AFDC, require mandatory coordination as outlined in
       Section 2D, are listed in the Product Index, and posted on the e-Publishing website.
          2.16.3.2.1. AFTTP3-1and3-3seriespublicationsareapprovedbythe MAJCOM/A3 (e.g.
          ACC/A3). The numbering is coordinated and jointly assigned by HQ ACC/A3TW
          (Langley AFB, VA) and the USAFWC/DOTW (Nellis AFB, NV).
          2.16.3.2.2. AFTTPs other than 3-1 and 3-3 series publications are approved by the
          issuing organization. Numbering is coordinated and jointly assigned with AFDC and
          the issuer. Once finalized, AFDC submits an electronic copy to AFDPO along with
          the fully coordinated and approved AF Form 673.

Section 2C—Legal Requirements

2.17. Specific Legal Requirements.
   2.17.1. Enforceability of Publications. Opening paragraphs must include, as warranted,
   specific enforceability language directing compliance by military and civilian personnel,
   including a description of the consequences of noncompliance. A combined opening
   statement could read as follows:
   "This Directive sets forth policies regarding protest or political activities of Air Force civilian
   and military personnel, including the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard. Failure to
   observe prohibitions and mandatory provisions of this directive in paragraphs 1, 17, and 32
   by military personnel is a violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).
   Violations may result in administrative disciplinary action without regard to otherwise
   applicable criminal or civil sanctions for violations of related laws."
      2.17.1.1. Nature and Purpose of Punitive Publications. A ―punitive‖ publication is one
      that is enforceable under Article 92(1) or 92(2) of the UCMJ. Article 92 has three
      subsections. Article 92(1) addresses violation of, or failure to obey, any lawful general
      order or regulation. Article 92(2) addresses certain other lawful orders of which the
      individual accused has actual knowledge. Article 92(3) punishes "dereliction of duty."
      The three subsections carry different maximum punishments. Article 92(1) carries a
      maximum punishment of a dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances,
      and confinement for 2 years. Article 92(2) carries a maximum punishment of a bad
      conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 6 months.
      Article 92(3) carries a maximum punishment of a bad conduct discharge, forfeiture of all
      pay and allowances, and confinement for 6 months, if the dereliction of duty was willful.
      If the dereliction was through neglect or culpable inefficiency, the maximum punishment
      is forfeiture of two-thirds pay per month for 3 months and confinement for 3 months.
      Reduction to E-1 is also possible for violations of any subsection of Article 92.
          2.17.1.1.1. Punitive Versus Nonpunitive Publications. Not all publications, even
          though lawful, are "punitive"; i.e. punishable under Article 92(1) or (2). To be
          "punitive," a publication must clearly set forth the specific conduct of individual
          members to be regulated, using mandatory language. Specific portions of publications
          that provide only general guidance or advice, or that require further supplementation
          by others to give them effect, will not be considered punitive for the purpose of
          Article 92(1) prosecution. A nonpunitive publication, on the other hand, is one that
          provides general guidelines or advice in conducting military functions. Even though a
          nonpunitive publication may not be enforced under Article 92(1) or (2), its provisions
          may form the basis for a duty that can be enforced under Article 92(3) as dereliction
          of duty. NOTE: The nonpunitive nature of a publication does not mean
          compliance is optional. Compliance with both punitive and nonpunitive is
          mandatory.
          2.17.1.1.2. General Order or Regulation. To be a ―general order or regulation‖ for the
          purposes of Article 92(1), a publication must be (1) published by the President,
          Secretary of Defense, or Secretary of one of the Services, or (2) issued by an officer
          having general court-martial convening authority, a general or flag officer in
AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                              81


        command, or a commander superior to either of those officers. A punitive publication
        that is not a ―general order or regulation‖ (i.e. it was issued by an authority other than
        one of the authorities listed earlier) can be enforced under Article 92(2) if the
        individual accused had actual knowledge of its existence.
        2.17.1.1.3. Making a Publication Punitive. In some instances, the matter discussed in
        a publication is of such consequence that failure to adhere to its proscriptions or
        mandates should result in punitive sanctions under Article 92, or other articles of the
        UCMJ. To be lawful, a punitive publication must be reasonable in furtherance of, or
        connected to, military needs (promotes morale, discipline, and usefulness of
        command), specific as to time and place, and definite and certain in describing the act
        or thing to do or omit, and not otherwise contrary to established law. Mandatory
        provisions place an affirmative duty upon an individual to do a certain act (e.g. lock a
        safe, follow a checklist, wear certain items, attend certain formations, etc.).
        Prohibitory provisions require that an individual not do something (e.g. enter a
        classified area, wear prohibited uniform combinations, drive in excess of a stated
        speed, etc.). Send all proposed punitive publications to the servicing legal office for
        review before issuance.
     2.17.1.2. Structure of a Punitive Publication. Generally, for a publication to be punitive,
     it must place obligations on individuals. The opening paragraph must specify which parts
     of the publication contain punitive provisions; a service member should be able to tell by
     looking in the introduction of the publication that it contains punitive provisions.
     Publications containing punitive provisions often provide nonpunitive information.
     Authors must, therefore, identify clearly those portions that are punitive in nature, or
     place punitive provisions in a separate publication.
     2.17.1.3. Specifying Punitive Portions in the Opening Paragraph. The opening paragraph
     must clearly specify which parts of a publication contain mandatory provisions and
     prohibitions enforceable against the individual. While such language standing alone in
     the opening paragraph does not make a publication punitive, it becomes punitive when
     combined with punitive language in the body of the publication. The opening paragraph
     must state clearly to what categories of people the punitive provisions apply; for instance,
     to all service members or to all crewmembers, or to all persons driving automobiles on
     bases. The opening paragraph must say that failure to observe the prohibitions and
     mandatory provisions in the publication is a violation of Article 92 of the UCMJ, or that
     noncompliance may result in punishment under Article 92 of the UCMJ.
     2.17.1.4. Punitive Language. Most of the recommended language used in publications
     does not readily put the reader on notice that the publication is punitive in nature. Use
     language that expresses the mandatory nature of the provisions, such as "will," "will not,"
     "shall," "shall not," "must," "must not," etc. Paragraphs containing mandatory provisions
     or prohibitions must state that a failure to obey is a violation of Article 92 of the UCMJ.
     This statement should accompany each mandatory provision or prohibition, or may, if
     clear, refer to a series of mandatory provisions or prohibitions listed within a specific
     paragraph.
  2.17.2. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (DODD 8910.1, Management and Control of
  Information Requirements, and DOD 8910.1-M, DOD Procedures for Management of
82                                                   AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


  Information Requirements). Each Air Force publication that authorizes collecting information
  internal or external to the Air Force is subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
  NOTE: Follow guidance provided in AFI 33-324. The Air Force must license collections
  with the proper reports control symbol (RCS). This includes information collection
  requirements in support of management functions, unless excluded in AFI33-324;
  information collected to satisfy statutory, congressional, and other interagency-imposed
  2.17.3. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (DOD 5400.7-R, DOD Freedom of Information
  Act Program). Federal statute, DOD and Air Force policy requires prompt and accurate
  disclosure of information to the public. Air Force publications must be reviewed by a FOIA
  specialist prior to publication to ensure compliance with FOIA requirements. Refer to DODR
  5400.7_AFSUP1, DOD Freedom of Information Act Program, for additional guidance and
  procedures.
  2.17.4. Privacy Act (PA) of 1974 (DODD 5400.11, DOD Privacy Program). Each Air Force
  publication will contain a PA warning statement if it provides for or requires the Air Force to
  collect or maintain personal information in a PA system of records that is retrieved by
  personal identifier. Follow AFI33-332, Privacy Act Program, for further privacy act
  guidance and sample privacy act statements. Privacy Act System Notices are available online
  at: http://www.defenselink.mil/privacy/notices/usaf.
  2.17.5. Federal Register (DOD 5025.1-M). The Air Force must notify the public of
  publications that affect the public, or will require public compliance. Make notification in the
  Federal Register as prescribed by AFI 33-320, Federal Register.
  2.17.6. Copyrighted material (AFI 51-303, Intellectual Property: Patents, Patent Related
  Matters, Trademarks and Copyrights). Do not use copyrighted information in Air Force
  publications without obtaining permission from the copyright holder. The only exception is
  use of very short passages of copyrighted works; check with your servicing legal office to
  determine if your intended use falls within this exception. NOTE: Permission for use must
  cite any restrictions on releasability. See paragraph 2.12 for instructions on formatting and
  Section 2E for instructions on processing publications with and without restricted
  releasability.
     2.17.6.1. To show the presence of copyrighted material in a draft, indicate on the AF
     Form 673 ("Additional Information" block) that the draft contains copyrighted material.
     2.17.6.2. At the bottom of the title page, centered below all other information, place the
     following statement in bold capital letters: THIS PUBLICATION CONTAINS
     COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL.
     2.17.6.3. Footnote copyrighted information in the text and cite the author of the work,
     the title, the publisher, and the year of publication. This applies regardless of whether
     permission from the copyright holder is required.
  2.17.7. Trade Names and Trademarks. When using a trade name or mark of a non-
  Federal/government entity, include the following disclaimer as the last sentence in the
  publication’s opening paragraph: ―The use of the name or mark of any specific manufacturer,
  commercial product, commodity, or service in this publication does not imply endorsement
  by the Air Force.‖ A trade name is simply the name of the commercial enterprise, such as the
  Microsoft® Company. Check the company’s website to determine if the name requires a
AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                             83


   ―Registered‖ symbol (®). Distinguish each use of a trademark by inserting a trademark
   symbol (™) after the mark. See AFI 51-303, Intellectual Property: Patents, Patent Related
   Matters, Trademarks and Copyrights, for further guidance.
   2.17.8. Compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. Because official unclassified
   AF publications are available on the e-Publishing website, publications at any level must be
   Section 508 compliant, in accordance with AFI 33-129, Web Management and Internet Use.
   AFDPO is responsible for ensuring all publications posted on the e-Publishing website are
   Section 508 compliant.

Section 2D—Coordination

2.18. Coordination. Coordination is a process through which an OPR obtains endorsements to
publishfromofficeswithfunctionalinterest/technicalexpertise,statutory oversight responsibilities,
mandatory (statutory/regulatory) review requirements, and is completed prior to obtaining
certifying and approving officials signatures on the AF Form 673. A completed AF Form 673
must accompany the draft submitted for publication, although OPRs may obtain coordination
using email, an AF IMT 1768 (SSS), or the AF Form 673 (electronic or pen-and-ink signatures
are acceptable) on draft publications. If signatures are obtained simultaneously (i.e.,
"shotgunned"), transcribe the information onto the AF Form 673 and maintain original
correspondence with signatures in the record set (see Section 2I for additional information on
record sets). Functional coordination should be completed and accepted, recommended changes
incorporated into the draft before the "final" version is submitted for mandatory coordination.
The OPR cannot release any final drafts for publication with unresolved nonconcurrences or
insufficient coordination. NOTE: Only civilian employees (includes direct-hire foreign national
employees, but not contractors or indirect-hire foreign national employees) and military
members may provide coordination on publications and forms at any level.
2.18. (45 SW)Electronic Coordination of Draft Publications. Replies from the individual or
office of coordination by fax or E-mail assumes the sender’s authenticity for documenting
coordination. OPR prints the E-mail reply and attaches it as well as any backup information to
the AF Form 673. OPR inserts the name, date and office symbol of the reply on the AF Form
673. The OPR will ensure the coordinating agency returns any hard copy information for
inclusion in the publication package. The original AF Form 673 must have pen and ink
signatures of the certifying and approving authorities. Electronic coordination is not acceptable
to obtain signatures of the certifying or approving authority officials on the AF Form 673. These
officials must sign the form.
   2.18.1. Coordination Requirements.
   2.18.1. (45 SW) Contact 45 SCS/SCOKC for mandatory coordination requirements to be
   obtained on AF Form 673. Minimum mandatory 45 SW coordination requirements are: the
   four group commanders (45 OG/CC, 45 MSG/CC, 45 MDG/CC, 45 LCG/CC), Staff Judge
   Advocate (45 SW/JA), Records Management office (45 SCS/SCOKB), 45 SW/PA, 45
   SW/OPSEC, 45 SW/FDO (Foreign Disclosure) and Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act
   office (45 SCS/SCX).
       2.18.1.1. Technical/Functional-Level Coordination. Obtain technical/functional
       comments from those offices with relevant expertise or statutory oversight
84                                                 AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


     responsibilities. All publishing actions except administrative changes (ACs) and
     responses to two-year or special reviews require technical/functional coordination. See
     Table 2.3 for technical/functional coordination rules. See paragraph 1.2.8 for
     technical/functional coordinator responsibilities.
        2.18.1.1.1. If the OPR neglects to obtain technical/functional coordination from an
        affected office the OPR may be required to do an immediate update if language in the
        publication is contested by an office that was not given the opportunity to coordinate.
        If resolution cannot be reached at the OPR level, the OPR must grant a waiver to the
        affected office absolving them from complying with the contested language until the
        issue is resolved. The OPR will involve the servicing legal office and elevate within
        the chain of command as necessary to resolve contested guidance. If the contested
        language is dictated in a DoD issuance, the Air Force OPR cannot waiver the DoD
        requirement. The office contesting the DoD guidance will need to work with the Air
        Force OPR for the DoD issuance, see IDAR database for OPR listing, to obtain a
        waiver or change the DoD guidance; send a courtesy copy of all email
        correspondences between the Air Force OPR and the DoD OPR to the SAF/AAX
        workflow box (safaax.workflow@pentagon.af.mil).
        2.18.1.1.1. (45 SW) Publications OPRs must obtain the coordination of all tasked
        agencies.
        2.18.1.1.2. AFPMs and GMs that require immediate release because they address
        critical issues only require a legal review, SAF/AAX review (AFPMs only), and the
        approval authority’s signature (the SECAF for AFPMs) on the AF Form 673. OPRs
        submitting an AFPM or GM under these circumstances must provide full justification
        on the AF Form 673.
     2.18.1.2. Mandatory Coordination. Only new publications and publication rewrites
     require mandatory coordination in addition to technical/functional coordination.
     EXCEPTION: Mandatory coordination is required for all actions taken on AFPDs,
     AFPMs, and AF supplements to DoDDs (except the approval of ACs). See Table 2.2 for
     mandatory coordination rules and paragraph 1.2.8 for mandatory coordinator
     responsibilities.
     2.18.1.3. Supplements to DODDs carry the same weight as AFPDs, and are subject to
     the same requirements; the SECAF will always be the authenticator on AFPDs and AF
     supplements to DODDs. Direct supplements to DODIs carry the same weight as AFIs
     and direct supplements to DODRs and DODMs carry the same weight as AFMANs—all
     must be coordinated accordingly.
     2.18.1.4. Certification and Approval. Once technical/functional and mandatory
     coordination is complete, the OPR obtains certification and then approval, in that order.
     Use appropriate staffing vehicle to obtain certifying and approving official manual or
     digital signatures on the AF Form 673. See Chapter 1 for detailed information on
     certifying and approving officials. NOTE: AFPMs require, in addition to certification
     and approval, technical/functional coordination, coordination with SAF/AAX, and a legal
     review by SAF/GCA; GMs require technical/functional and legal coordination, in order
     to expedite processing. Certifying and approval authorities at the HAF for AFPMs and
     AFGMs are the same as for AFPDs and AFIs, respectively.
AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                             85


     2.18.1.5. Unless otherwise specified in unit-level guidance, HOIs and OIs follow
     coordination requirements for directive publications. Requirements for HOIs generated
     by the HAF (Air Staff or Secretariat) are established in HOI 33-13, Headquarters Air
     Force Operating Instructions, Pamphlets, and Handbooks Management Program, which
     is maintained by HAF/IM.
     2.18.1.6. Resolving Non-Concurrences.
         2.18.1.6.1. Critical comments that result in a non-concurrence shall be resolved
         between the concerned parties before a publication is approved and published.
         Approving officials make final decisions on resolution during impasses. (NOTE:
         When impasses involve a supplement and the HHQ guidance being supplemented, the
         approving official for the HHQ publication is the resolving authority) The resolution
         process is the responsibility of the OPR, including the manner in which conducted.
         The process may consist of informal or formal exchanges by phone, e-mail, and/or
         memo; meetings and working groups. If the OPR is unable to resolve the comments,
         they shall elevate the issues to the certifying official for resolution. NOTE: The OPR
         must stay involved in the process even if elevated to a higher authority.
         2.18.1.6.2. Resolution of a non-concurrence shall be documented by the coordinating
         offices written withdrawal of the non-concurrence, signed at the same or a higher
         level as the original coordination, EXCEPT that when the comments leading to the
         non-concurrence are accepted in full and incorporated into the publication, no
         withdrawal of the non-concurrence is required.
         2.18.1.6.3. If the OPR is unable to resolve a non-concurrence after involving the
         certifying official, the impasse shall be addressed in a memorandum, or other written
         documentation, to the Approving Official requesting the AF Form 673 be signed.
         Both sides of the comments shall be clearly and succinctly addressed in the document
         along with a recommendation for the approving authority. NOTE: The
         documentation becomes part of the permanent record-set of the publication.
  2.18.2. Preparing the AF Form 673. NOTE: when an OPR submits an AF Form 673 to
  accomplish a publishing action (new, change, cancellation), block 1 should contain the
  publishing manager’s office (e.g., AFDPO for HAF OPRs); when the publishing office is
  initiating a two-year or a special review on publications and forms, block 1 should contain
  the OPR’s contact name and office symbol. OPRs only complete section 3 during a two-year
  or special review.
     2.18.2.1. A "fillable" electronic version of this form is available on the e-Publishing
     website. Complete the AF Form 673 in its entirety, including special information in block
     32, if necessary.
         2.18.2.1.1. Indicate in block 32 if the draft contains copyrighted material. Indicate in
         block 9 if the draft contains For Official Use Only (FOUO) material.
         2.18.2.1.2. To avoid the issuance of unfunded mandates, indicate in block 32 if the
         publication drives the need for additional or different manpower, funding, contract
         terms, etc. Include dollar amounts or man-hours when possible; if no dollar amounts
         or man-hours have been specified be sure to include summary statements alerting
         coordinators of the areas in the draft that may have resource implications.
86                                                  AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


     2.18.2.2. Block 10 ("Purpose"): Note that no more than five (5) ICs may be made to a
     publication, and no single IC may alter more than 20 percent of the content (see
     paragraph 2.25).
     2.18.2.3. Blocks 11, 12a, and 12b are designed to capture form-related information;
     completion of these blocks is necessary if you have created a form and prescribed its use
     in a publication, or if you adopt the use of an existing form in a publication. Block 15 is
     designed to capture information about temporary and permanent visual aids. While it is
     not necessary to explicitly prescribe a permanent visual aid in a publication, it is
     necessary to associate a permanent visual aid with the publication that provides
     justification/reason for its creation. Block 13 ("Special Printing") gives OPRs who have
     created a publication or form that requires printing (such as a bound manual, pamphlets
     for display, etc.) a standard place to alert publication/form managers and provide their
     unique specifications.
     2.18.2.4. If your publication and/or form has releasability restrictions, copy the
     releasability statement from the front matter of the publication (or the footer of the form)
     and paste into block 14. Doing so will alert the publications/forms manager that your
     publication/form may not be posted to a publicly-accessible website and ensure proper
     distribution of your publication/form.
     2.18.2.5. All coordinations must be obtained before the certifying and approval
     authorities manually or digitally sign the AF Form 673. Coordinators may also sign the
     AF Form 673 manually or digitally. NOTE: Applying digital signatures in the certifier
     and approval authority blocks "lock" all preceding information; once the certifying or
     approval authority has digitally signed the AF Form673, no changes can be made to any
     preceding information without removing one (or both) of the signatures.
     2.18.2.6. Obtain the certifying official’s signature. The certifying official is a minimum
     of one organizational level above the OPR and certifies the need for the publication, to
     include currency of information, applicability to the Air Force, and propriety of content.
     The certifier referenced in the publication must sign block 19.
        2.18.2.6.1. Departmental publications authored by a MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, or other
        field unit must be certified and approved at the HAF.
     2.18.2.7. Obtain the approving official’s signature. See paragraph 1.2.7.1 for
     description of approving officials. The authority to sign for a new publication may not be
     delegated, however the authority to sign block 22 of the AF Form 673 for revisions or
     cancellations may be delegated (see paragraphs 1.2.7 - 1.2.7.4.1). NOTE: The signature
     block/authentication at the end of the publication remains that of the approving official
     even if the authority to sign the AF Form 673 has been delegated.
        2.18.2.7.1. The SECAF is the only authenticator and approving official for AFPDs,
        PMs, and AF supplements to DODDs.
     2.18.2.8. Represent all functional and mandatory coordination in Section II. If you use
     other means to collect coordination, type in the required information on the master AF
     Form 673, and keep the individually signed email, AF Form 673, or AF IMT 1768 (SSS)
     for your record set. HAF OPRs must send a fully coordinated and signed AF Form 673
     along with each publication for processing to AFDPO-PPP@pentagon.af.mil. NOTE:
AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                           87


     Field OPRs must send a fully coordinated and signed AF Form 673 along with each
     publication for processing to the publications/ forms management office. Field publishing
     managers are not required to submit the accompanying AF Form 673 to AFDPO, unless
     the publication is departmental.
     2.18.2.9. OPRs should allow at least two weeks for offices to provide coordination. If the
     publication is particularly large or complicated, allow additional time.
        2.18.2.9.1. If coordinating offices are unable to meet a suspense date, requests for
        extensions must be submitted to the OPR.
     2.18.2.10. In providing concurrence, coordinators agree to the contents within a
     publication or form from a functional perspective. Additionally, coordinators are agreeing
     to the releasability of the publication, as stated by the OPR in the publication. If the
     contents or purpose of a publication or a form are in conflict with existing policy or
     guidance, or if the releasability as stated in the publication is not in keeping with
     guidance in AFI 31-401, coordinators must provide feedback to the OPR accordingly.
     2.18.2.11. Comment Matrix. OPRs will provide coordinators with a standard comment
     matrix for providing feedback. The standard comment matrix will include columns for
     the following elements: organization, item number, type of comment (Administrative,
     Substantive, or Critical—include a legend at the bottom of the matrix), page number,
     paragraph number, line number, comment, and rationale. Regardless of the type of
     coordination comment, coordinators must designate a POC to work with the OPR
     towards resolution. The POC designated by the reviewer may not be a contractor or an
     indirect-hire foreign national. Coordinators must specify one of the following types of
     comments for each comment provided in a standard comment matrix.
        2.18.2.11.1. Administrative comments address typographical, grammatical, and
        formatting errors.
        2.18.2.11.2. Substantive comments address those portions of a document that appear
        to be unnecessary, incorrect, misleading, confusing, or inconsistent.
        2.18.2.11.3. Critical comments are major deficiencies that will preclude final
        approval and publication (i.e., result in a nonconcur). Rationale for critical comments
        must be provided.
     2.18.2.12. OPRs must resolve all critical comments before submitting the publication or
     form for final processing and publishing. Ensure that any critical comments submitted to
     the OPR are clear and that a POC within the coordinating office is designated so the OPR
     may follow-up. OPRs will work directly with the POC to resolve any issues. Resolution
     of comments must be included in the record set for the publication/form.
     2.18.2.13. If the AF Form 673 or the AF IMT 1768 (SSS) contains coordination more
     than one year old and no significant changes to the draft contents have been made, OPRs
     must state in block 32 of the AF Form 673 that no recoordination is necessary before the
     certifying and approval officials sign the form. If significant changes have been made the
     OPR is responsible for reaccomplishing necessary coordination.

Table 2.2. Mandatory Coordination.
  All new and rewritten publications must be reviewed/coordinated to address the subject areas
  identified in column A of this table. Mandatory coordination is also required for all actions
  taken on AFPDs and AF supplements to DoDDs, except ACs. Mandatory coordinator
  responsibilities are outlined in paragraph 1.2.8. Column B provides mandatory coordinator
  contact information for processing departmental publications. Field publication managers
  may supplement this table to provide specific addresses of local offices for mandatory
  coordination; otherwise the field publication OPR must locate local offices to provide the
  mandatory coordination listed in column A. FOAs and DRUs that do not have staff dedicated
  to publications/forms management will use offices identified at column B to fulfill their
  coordination requirements.

 NOTES:
   1. Contact coordinating offices for instructions on routing sensitive and classified
   publications.
   2. All publications going to the SECAF for signature must be routed through the Command
   section at the HAF. Refer to HOI 33-3, Information Workflow Management and
   Correspondence Preparation, for guidance on submitting packages for SECAF signature.
   3. See paragraph 2.18.1.5. for coordination requirements for HOIs and OIs. OPRs for HAF
   HOIs and OIs must refer to HOI 33-13 for guidance and procedures.
   4. Publications and forms will be submitted to two-letter/digit organizations, unless
   otherwise directed in the coordination tables. Two-letters are responsible for ensuring the
   correct offices within the organization review and coordinate on the publication and/or form
   and for providing a consolidated response. The consolidated response does not necessarily
   have to carry a two- letter/digit level signature; the two-letter/digit may designate a lower-
   level office within the organization to provide the response and sign off on the coordination
   form provided.
2.19. Technical/Functional Coordination. Technical/functional coordination is required for
all actions on publications unless explicitly exempted in this AFI and is based on the type of
content covered in the publication. The following table is not all-inclusive; coordinate with all
offices having technical or functional expertise even if they do not appear in the following table.
Technical/functional coordinators’ responsibilities are outlined in paragraph 1.2.8. NOTE: If a
publication is routed for technical/functional coordination it is not necessary to resubmit the
publication to the same office for mandatory coordination.

         agencies that have a
         functional relationship with
         MR bear primary
         responsibility for developing
         proposed policy and
         executing the approved
         policy. They will ensure that
         SAF/MR coordination is
         obtained by coordinating the
         content of their publications.
         All mandatory (except
         SAF/AA on AFPDs) and
         functional coordination must
         be completed before
         obtaining SAF/MR
         coordination. This ensures
         that all others have had an
         opportunity to review and
         comment.

Section 2E—Publishing Finalized Publications

2.20. Posting on the e-Publishing Website.
   2.20.1. With the exception of ANG wings/subunits, OPRs submit all publications for release
   on the e-Publishing website to the local publications/forms manager. The publishing manager
   for departmental publications is AFDPO (AFDPO-PPP@pentagon.af.mil); the publishing
   manager for HOIs, HPAMs, and HAF Handbooks generated at the HAF (Secretariat or Air
   Staff) is HAF/IM (hafim.workflow@pentagon.af.mil).
   2.20.1. (45 SW) The wing publishing activity, 45 SCS/SCOKC, will forward their
   publications to the Air Force publishing facility via the Community of Practice (CoP) system
   set up by Air Force for SGML tagging. Air Force publishing automatically places wing level
   publications on the e-Publishing web site unless instructed otherwise. The wing publishing
   office, 45 SCS/SCOKC, will ensure that content releasability certification for their
   publications has been completed prior to Air Force placing 45th Space Wing publications on
   the Air Force web site.
       2.20.1.1. Field publications/forms managers submitting directly to AFDPO will submit
       files for processing via AFDPOs AF Portal Community of Practice (CoP) website. Field
       files should not be sent via e-mail, although field publications/forms managers should
       send notification of the submission to the AFDPO-CTO organizational e-mail address. If
       you lack access to the CoP site, please contact AFDPO for a login and password at
       AFDPO-CTO@pentagon.af.mil. ANG field publications will be submitted to the local
       wing publications/forms managers, and are not sent to AFDPO for formatting.
   2.20.2. After the publication is processed it will be posted to the website. AFDPO will notify
   the publications/forms manager via e-mail or fax when publications are posted to the e-
   Publishing website. AFDPO posts products to the e-Publishing website 5-7 business days
   after receiving the complete submission from the OPR. If AFDPO requires additional time
   the OPR will be notified. NOTE: OPRs are encouraged to notify affected staff offices when a
   publication is released, revised, or rescinded and posted on the e-Publishing website. The
   OPR notice should include a statement alerting recipients that related publications and/or
   processes may be affected.
       2.20.2.1. AFPMs and GMs (HAF and field level) will be posted to the e-Publishing
       website under the appropriate subject series. If an AFPM or a GM (HAF or field level)
       amends an existing publication, AFDPO will post the AFPM or GM "on top" of the
       publication, so that publication users will view the AFPM or GM at the beginning of the
       document.
AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                               97


   2.20.3. A subscription-based electronic notification system is available on the e-Publishing
   website. This service will notify subscribers of all new, revised, changed, or rescinded
   products posted to the e-Publishing website.
   2.20.4. Because a restricted/classified departmental publishing site is not yet available, field
   publishing activities may post electronic classified and FOUO publications on the local
   headquarters SIPRNET site. All classified and FOUO publications posted on a headquarters
   SIPRNET site must be listed under an unclassified title in the Product Index on the e-
   Publishing website.
   2.20.5. If a departmental publication or form is classified, FOUO, or the publication is a
   visual aid designed for display, it will be scheduled for printing rather than posted to the e-
   Publishing website. Discuss production alternatives with the publications/forms manager
   (AFDPO) if a printed product is not ideal.
2.21. Processing Physical Products for Printing.
   2.21.1. The OPR will submit a completed Government Printing Office (GPO) Form 952,
   Desktop Publishing Disk Information; AF Form 673; a clean printout; disk; and any
   additional artwork to the local publications manager. Ask your publications/forms manager
   for help with filling out forms and/ or identifying graphics requirements, if necessary.
   2.21.2. Printing in two or more colors generally increases costs. All publications/forms
   managers must ensure that multicolor printing projects are necessary, that minimum color
   printing is used, and that the extra cost is justified. NOTE: Avoid using excessive printing
   requirements (e.g. coated paper, embossing, die-cutting, foil stamping, etc.). The OPR must
   justify use of multicolor printing and/or additional printing requirements in block 38 of the
   AF Form 673.
   2.21.3. If the OPR deems it is necessary, unrestricted physical products may be sold
   publicly. The OPR must complete GPO Form 3868, Notification of Intent to Publish, and
   provide to the local publications manager, who will process it through AFDPO/PPL. Sales to
   the public will be handled by the Department of Commerce, National Technical Information
   Services (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161-0001.
   2.21.4. Physical products may be ordered from the e-Publishing website, or directly from the
   local Defense Automated Printing Service (DAPS) office. Contact your publications manager
   for bulk printing of electronic products. NOTE: Funding for printing publishing products
   may be centralized within your local publishing function.
   2.21.5. OPRs will receive a copy of the printed publication or form, which will serve as
   notice that the publishing process is complete. The OPR may request additional copies for
   OPR- driven dissemination on the AF Form 673 in block 38. The OPR may also furnish a list
   of intended recipients on the AF Form 673 for AFDPO-driven dissemination. Any additional
   distribution restrictions should be included in block 38 of the AF Form 673.

Section 2F—Updating Publications

2.22. Suggesting Updates to Publications. Any Air Force member or employee may report
errors, suggest revisions, and recommend corrective action by submitting an AF Form 847 to the
OPR, or through the appropriate functional’s chain of command for higher headquarters
 98                                                  AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


publications. AF Form 847 is prescribed in AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program (FMP).
Refer to that publication for guidance on filling out the form.
   2.22.1. When a unit issues a publication that conflicts with one of its own publications, the
   activity noting the discrepancy should submit an AF Form 847 to both OPRs highlighting the
   conflict and requesting a resolution. OPRs are responsible for working with each other to
   deconflict and issue the correct publication(s).
   2.22.2. If a field activity notices a discrepancy between higher-headquarters publications,
   submit an AF Form 847 to both OPRs, following the chain of command as appropriate. AF
   Form 847s submitted for HAF publications must be sent through the appropriate functional’s
   chain of command.
   2.22.3. Certifying the Currency of Publications. Publications/forms managers Air Force-
   wide will initiate a review every two years of publications and any forms prescribed therein
   in the anniversary month of the publication date, using an AF Form 673. AFDPO will initiate
   the review of all departmental publications, even those departmental publications that are
   authored in the field (record sets for departmental publications authored in the field will be
   kept in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) and the field
   publications/forms manager’s instruction). If the OPR has given publication status on an AF
   Form 673 within the past year, postpone the review until the next cycle. NOTE: Both the
   OPR and the certifying official identified in the publication must sign the AF Form 673
   during the two-year or a special review; when certifying a publication as current or providing
   status outside a review cycle, the OPR and the certifying official must sign the 673. No
   additional coordination is required if only providing status; additional coordination may be
   required if providing status and also requesting action on a publication/form.
   2.22.3. (45 SW) Initiating Review of Publications. For 45th Space Wing, the publishing
   manager, 45 SCS/SCOKC, initiates review of 45 SW publications on an AF Form 673
   prepared and forwarded to the appropriate office every 2 years in lieu of using the
   anniversary month. OPRs review their publications to determine whether the publication is
   current, requires revision or can be rescinded.
      2.22.3.1. If the OPR determines there are no changes to the publication the OPR must
      indicate this on the AF Form 673 and submit it to the publications/forms manager (see
      also paragraphs 2.8.5 and 2.24.1 to ensure no changes are necessary). OPRs for
      departmental publications submit the completed AF Form 673 directly to AFDPO-
      PPP@pentagon.af.mil; field publications managers may send relevant information to
      AFDPO via email at AFDPO-CTO@pentagon.af.mil (it is not necessary to include the
      field OPR’s AF Form 673). AFDPO will add ―Certified current [add date the AF Form
      673 is received]‖ under the publication date and post on the e-Publishing website. For
      ANG publications, NGB-DMJ-P will add ―Certified Current [add date the AF Form 673
      is received] under the publication date for ANG FOA-level publications and post to the
      NGB publishing site (http://www.ngbpdc.ngb.army.mil/publications.htm).
      2.22.3.2. If changes must be made, the OPR must submit an AC, IC, or a rewrite
      within180 days of the date listed on the AF Form 673. See paragraphs 2.25-2.27 for
      guidance on submitting changes or rewriting a publication.
AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                            99


     2.22.3.3. If a publication is obsolete, required coordination, certification, and approval
     must be completed before the OPR returns the AF Form 673 to the publications/forms
     management office. NOTE: the SECAF must approve the cancellation of any AFPD or
     AF supplement to a DODD; this authority may not be delegated.
     2.22.3.4. If a departmental publication or form is classified, FOUO, or the publication is
     a permanent visual aid designed for display, it will be scheduled for printing rather than
     postedtothee-Publishingwebsite.Discussproductionalternativeswiththe publications/forms
     manager if a printed product is not ideal. OPRs may request limited reprints of printed
     products during the two-year review. Request a limited reprint if inventory is low for an
     essential publication or form that requires revision. Note on the AF Form 673 how many
     months you will need to complete the revision so the appropriate amount of inventory
     may be ordered.
  2.22.4. Transfer of Responsibility for a Publication. When a functional OPR transfers
  responsibility for a publication to a different organization, the transferring official must
  notify the publications/ forms manager (send a copy to SAF/AAX for transfers of
  departmental publications that implement a DOD Issuance) using an AF Form 673. The two-
  letter functional principal of the losing activity is the certifying authority. The functional
  principal of the gaining authority is the approval official. The OPR for the losing activity
  must obtain technical/functional coordination on the AF Form 673; contact information for
  the new OPR goes in block 32 of the AF Form 673. NOTE: If transferring responsibility for
  an AFPD or AF supplement to a DODD, the SECAF must serve as the approving authority.
  2.22.4. (45 SW) Transfer of Responsibilities for a Publication. When an OPR transfers
  responsibility for a publication, they must obtain concurrence, in writing, from the new OPR,
  and then forward a copy through the appropriate chain-of-command to the supporting
  publishing activity. For 45th Space Wing activities, forward the transfer correspondence to
  45 SCS/SCOKC.
     2.22.4.1. If transferring numerous publications and/or forms at one time, an indorsement
     memo or SSS listing all the publications marked for transfer (number, title, and date)
     signed by the functional principal of the losing activity and indorsed by the functional
     principle of the gaining activity indicating acceptance will suffice. Send a courtesy copy
     to publications/forms manager (AFDPO for departmental publications and, if the
     publications directly implement DoD Issuances, a copy to SAF/AAX). A copy of the
     memo must be included in the record set for each affected publication.
     2.22.4.2. Gaining OPRs of transferred publications must alert OPRs of supplements of
     the transfer. Transferred publications are often assigned new numbers and otherwise
     updated, and OPRs for subordinate publications will need to update their publications
     accordingly.
     2.22.4.3. In addition to carrying out all reorganization/realignment responsibilities
     described in AFI 10-501, Program Action Directives (PAD) and Programming Plans
     (PPLAN), gaining OPRs for transferred publications will need to accomplish an IC to
     change the control number (if transferring to a different subject series), certifying and
     approving official information, and any other affected content. The record set for the
     publication being transferred must also be moved to the gaining OPR; accommodations
     for this action must be written into transfer agreements (PAD, PGL, etc.).
 100                                                   AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


2.23. Requesting a Waiver. When complying with a higher headquarters publication adversely
affects your mission due to a unique situation, you may request a waiver from the OPR; send a
request via e-mail or memorandum, explaining the need for the waiver. If deemed necessary by
the OPR, the waiver request may be elevated within the organization for review and approval. If
the waiver is granted, the OPR of the publication must file it with the record set and provide a
copy of the waiver to the publications/forms manager (AFDPO is the manager for HAF OPRs)
when submitting the draft for publication. Field publications/forms managers must include a
copy of each related waiver when submitting products to AFDPO. A waiver remains in effect
until the OPR cancels it in writing, the publication is completely rewritten, or the waiver expires
(the expiration date must be specified in the documentation granting the waiver). Include a
statement in the opening paragraph if no waivers are authorized for that particular publication or
if no waivers are authorized for certain portions of the publication.
   2.23.1. In some cases, the waiver may last the life of the basic publication. If so, the
   organization requesting a waiver may need to create a supplement to implement the waiver.
   The OPR of the basic publication will work with the organization requesting a waiver to
   design appropriate guidance if a supplement is necessary. State in the opening paragraph if
   the supplement has been created to implement a waiver.
2.24. Revising a Publication. Issuing an IC, administrative change (AC), AFPM/GM, or a
rewrite are the only authorized methods of revising/changing an official Air Force publication. A
publication requires a rewrite when major content is affected by a change in Air Force mission,
organization, DoD mandate, or five interim changes (ICs) have been issued. All authorized
changes will be attached to, in the case of AFPM/GMs and ACs, or incorporated into the
publication when doing an IC, and posted on the e-Publishing website. NOTE: OPRs of physical
publications (non-electronic) that have been printed usually must issue rewrites, because making
page changes is often cost-prohibitive. Check with your publications/forms manager to discuss
possible alternatives if a change is necessary.
2.24. (45 SW)Contact the Publishing Manager. Contact the publishing manager, 45
SCS/SCOKC, for the most current rich text format file, (.rtf) or (.doc) file of a publication before
beginning a new revision.
   2.24.1. When a higher headquarters publication is updated (either by an interim change or a
   rewrite), implementing publications (such as supplements) must be rewritten, updated using
   an IC, or, if applicable, certified as current within 180 days. Publications/forms managers
   may use the AF Form 399 to alert OPRs of changes to higher headquarters publications.
   Publications/forms managers will fill out the top half of the form, using the "special
   instructions" block to tell the OPR how to access the publication and to note the type of
   action taken on the higher headquarters publication (e.g., revised, rescinded, amended using a
   GM, etc.). OPRs will fill out the bottom half in response. An AF Form673 must accompany
   any final requests for action by the OPR.
   2.24.1. (45 SW) Coordination more than 180 days old must be reaccomplished prior to
   publication of the document.
       2.24.1.1. Only those implementing publications that do not require any content changes
       after the higher headquarters publication is changed may be certified as current. OPRs
       will follow the same procedures for certifying supplementary guidance as current
       whether the supplement is in standalone or integrated format on the e-Publishing website
AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                                101


      (standaloneversionsonlyincludesupplementarymaterialwhereasintegrated versions insert
      supplementary material into the higher headquarters publication). Procedures for
      certifying a publication as current may be found in paragraph 2.22.3. NOTE: If the
      implementing publication conflicts with the higher headquarters publication, the
      implementing publication must immediately be rescinded and removed from the website.
      OPRs may issue a GM to replace the conflicting publication, or add new guidance to non-
      conflicting implementing publications while the publication is under revision.
      2.24.1.2. GMs used to replace or amend implementing publications will expire when the
      supplement is revised (must be within 180 days). Expired GMs (those exceeding 180
      days) and implementing publications that have not been updated within 180 days will be
      removed from the e-Publishing website and the publications manager will be notified.
      See paragraphs under 2.10.4 and 2.12.5 for guidance on formatting a GM. NOTE:
      "Policy letters", guides, and bulletins are not recognized as part of the publishing
      program; any guidance or information issued in a policy letter, guide, or bulletin
      requiring implementation/compliance must be established in a publication type described
      in this instruction and processed accordingly.
   2.24.2. Summary of Changes. A summary of changes is mandatory for all ICs and rewritten
   publications. The summary of changes cites major changes: content changes; new, revised, or
   obsolete forms; new, revised, or rescinded recurring reports; etc. Place the summary of
   changes immediately after the opening paragraph. Include this statement as the last sentence
   when making an IC (not when issuing a rewrite): "A margin bar indicates newly revised
   material." NOTE: Do not include a summary of changes for new publications.
      2.24.2.1. ACs do not require a summary of changes.
2.25. Interim Changes (IC).
   2.25.1. Changes to mission-essential information (e.g., law, DoD mandate, Air Force policy
   or guidance, etc.) and/or a major reorganization are examples of events that may necessitate
   substantive changes to an existing publication, although OPRs may use ICs to change any
   type of information in the publication. OPRs may issue only five (5) ICs to Air Force
   publications, none of which will change more than 20 percent of the paragraphs in the
   publication (attachments, tables, figures, and illustrations count as paragraphs). After the fifth
   IC, the publication must be rewritten, which requires mandatory and technical/functional
   coordination (reference paragraph 2.27). ICs cannot be made to AFPMs or GMs.
      2.25.1.1. ICs will not change the basic date of the publication, will not supersede the
      basic publication, and will not automatically certify the publication as current (see
      paragraph 2.22.3 for certifying a publication current). Publication Managers, or OPRs
      for Supplements to DoD Issuances, will insert a line in the publication header under the
      basic date stating, for example, "Incorporating Change 1, [AFDPO inserts date IC is
      posted on e-Pubs]" or "Incorporating Through Change 3, [insert date third IC posted]."
      2.25.1.2. After the fifth IC, OPRs should begin preparing a full rewrite to allow for
      expeditious coordination when the next change comes in.
      2.25.1.3. Protect FOUO or classified ICs as directed in AFI 31-401.
   2.25.2. Interim Change Processing.
102                                                  AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


      2.25.2.1. The publications/forms manager assigns a number to each change. ICs are
      numbered cumulatively, and may not exceed 5 (IC-1, IC-2, IC-3, IC-4, IC-5). ICs may be
      spread out over a number of years; the assigned number should be cumulative, regardless
      of the year in which the IC is being accomplished.
      2.25.2.2. Submit the IC in Microsoft Word®, 12-point Times New Roman font. The
      publications/ forms manager assigns the date of the IC. The date of the IC is the effective
      date; ICs are not considered effective until they are released to users IAW this
      Instruction. The publications/forms manager for HAF OPRs is AFDPO (AFDPO-
      PPP@pentagon.af.mil). IC dates assigned by AFDPO cannot exceed seven (7) business
      days after they receive complete and correct materials from the OPR. With proper
      justification interim changes at any level may be assigned an "effective" date that falls in
      the future, but under no circumstances may interim changes be backdated.
      2.25.2.3. Changes will be made in complete paragraphs, (i.e., submit the entire paragraph
      3 to replace the existing paragraph 3, even if only one word or one sentence changed).
      Each changed paragraph, table, figure, etc., must be preceded by an asterisk (*), which
      will trigger placement of the margin bar when the publication is formatted. A change
      must not renumber existing content; add new paragraphs or sub-paragraphs (or figures,
      chapters, etc.) as needed to insert additional material without renumbering the existing
      content. Changed material will be identified with a margin bar in the basic publication.
         2.25.2.3.1. A deleted paragraph should cite the paragraph number and the word
         DELETED, (e.g., "3.77. DELETED"). NOTE: references to deleted content must be
         removed and the document re-numbered during a rewrite.
         2.25.2.3.2. Figures, Tables, and Attachments. Completely delete or provide a
         completely new figure, table, or attachment to replace the current figure, table, or
         attachment. Figures, tables, and attachments can be added as long as there is a
         reference to them in a paragraph.
      2.25.2.4. OPRs must obtain technical/functional coordination on the proposed changes,
      using the AF Form 673, before obtaining the certifying and approving officials’
      signatures (if issuing an IC to an AFPD or an AF supplement to a DODD, only the
      SECAF may approve). Mandatory coordination is only required for ICs to AFPDs and
      AF supplements to DODDs. Send the IC along with the properly signed and dated AF
      Form 673 to the publications/forms manager for processing (AFDPO-PPP for HAF
      publications). If the signatures are correct, the IC will be processed and posted to the e-
      Publishing website within seven business days of submission. OPRs may request faster
      processing of the IC on the AF Form 673; AFDPO will review and respond directly to
      requests for faster processing.
      2.25.2.5. After the IC is posted to the e-Publishing website, AFDPO will notify the OPR
      or the publications/forms manager. OPRs are encouraged to notify affected staff offices
      when a publication is released, revised, or rescinded and posted on the e- Publishing
      website. The OPR notice should include a statement alerting recipients that related
      publications and/or processes may be affected.
      2.25.2.6. ICs for AF Supplements to DoD Issuances are formatted and integrated by the
      OPRs; AFDPO does not integrate the IC material into these types of Supplements. OPRs
AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                            103


       make changes directly to the published version and provide a camera ready copy to
       AFDPO for publishing along with the AF Form 673. Each changed paragraph, table,
       figure, etc., must be preceded by an asterisk (*).

Figure 2.2. Sample Interim Change.




2.26. Administrative Changes (AC). Purely administrative changes that do not affect the
subject matter content, authority, purpose, application, and/or implementation of the publication
may be made by submitting an AF Form 673 signed by the certifying official to the
publications/forms manager. Because these types of changes are non-substantive, no
coordination is required. There is no limit on the number of administrative changes to a
publication. Administrative Changes include:
   2.26.1. Office symbol changes (OPR, Certifying Official’s office symbol, and office
   symbols mentioned in the text) due to a transfer of responsibility for a function or a
   publication, or as a result of a reorganization. Other changes may be made on a waiver basis
   (submit waiver requests to the SAF/ AAX Workflow).
       2.26.1.1. Only OPRs may make administrative changes to their publications. The
       certifying official must sign the AF Form 673; SAF/AA will approve administrative
       changes to AFPDs and AF supplements to DODDs.
       2.26.1.2. ACs will not be integrated into the basic publication, but will appear when the
       publication is opened from the e-Publishing site (readers will click on the publication
 104                                                  AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


       link, the AC will pop up, and readers will have to click on a link to that publication from
       the AC screen). The AC notification will be removed when the publication is updated.
       OPRs must include ACs in an IC or a rewrite to incorporate changes into the actual
       publication.
       2.26.1.3. Submit a statement with the AC in Microsoft Word®, 12-point Times New
       Roman font (e.g., References to AF/DP should be changed to AF/A1 throughout the
       publication; references to SAF/AAX should be changed to SAF/AA in paragraphs 1.5
       and 3.6). A date will be assigned to that AC when it is posted with the publication and
       placed at the end of the description of changes (see Figure 2.3).
       2.26.1.4. ACs will be listed chronologically. It is the OPR’s responsibility to keep an
       updated list of ACs; OPRs will submit a complete list of all ACs each time a new AC is
       added. The date assigned to each previous AC must be incorporated into the document
       submitted by the OPR (e.g. References to AF/DP should be changed to AF/A1
       throughout the publication; references to SAF/ AAX should be changed to SAF/AA in
       paragraph 1.5 and 3.6 15. March 2005.).
       2.26.1.5. Unless explicitly stated, the addition of an AC will not cancel existing ACs. If
       explicitly stated (e.g. References to AF/XOI should be changed to AF/A2; this supersedes
       the AC dated 31 March 2006), "Canceled" will be inserted by the OPR next to the date of
       the superseded AC. Once an IC is made to a publication, or the publication is rewritten,
       all ACs posted for that publication will be removed from the e-Publishing website.

Figure 2.3. Sample Administrative Change.




2.27. Publication Rewrites. If you have made five ICs to your publication, or if more than 20%
of your publication requires revision, you must rewrite the entire publication and obtain
mandatory and technical/functional coordination. Both the certifying and approving officials
must sign the AF Form 673. In addition to making the necessary content changes:
   2.27.1. State in the Summary of Changes paragraph "This document has been substantially
   revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes include [insert summary of major
   changes]."
   2.27.2. Remove references to "DELETED" text made during an IC and re-number the
   publication accordingly.
   2.27.3. Ensure all references (including cross-references within the text, references to
   additional publications, references to forms, and references to specific offices and
   individuals) are verified and updated as required.
AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                               105


   2.27.4. Submit the rewritten publication with a fully coordinated and signed AF Form 673 to
   your publications/forms manager for processing. After the rewrite is posted to the e-
   Publishing website, AFDPO will notify the OPR, with a courtesy copy to the
   publications/forms manager. OPRs are encouraged to notify affected staff offices when a
   publication is released, revised, or rescinded and posted on the e-Publishing website. The
   OPR notice should include a statement alerting recipients that related publications and/or
   processes may be affected.
   2.27.5. Initiate a review and update, if necessary, of any forms prescribed by the publication.
   See Chapter 3 for more information on reviewing and updating forms.
2.28. Unauthorized Changes to Publications. Rewrites or changes that are not processed IAW
guidance in this publication are unauthorized and unofficial. When an activity receives a revised
publication or notice of a change issued by methods other than those prescribed in this
publication, immediately notify the publications/ forms manager by e-mail or memorandum
(contact SAF/AAX for departmental publications with a courtesy copy to AFDPO-PPP). The
publications/forms manager (or SAF/AAX, for departmental publications) will immediately
contact the OPR to establish a corrective course of action. From the date the OPR is contacted
the unauthorized change must be reprocessed IAW guidance in this publication.
   2.28.1. Draft publications are not for implementation or compliance. Publications are
   considered drafts until they have been certified, approved, and processed in accordance with
   this instruction. Release of any draft material for informational or review purposes must
   clearly indicate that the attached policy/guidance is still a draft and is not for implementation
   or compliance.

Section 2G—Rescinding Publications

2.29. Obsolete Publications. A publication becomes obsolete when another publication
supersedes it, when the OPR rescinds it, or when AFDPO removes it from the website, as will be
case for expired AFPMs, GMs, and outdated supplements.
   2.29.1. OPRs planning to rescind a publication must complete technical/functional
   coordination in addition to obtaining certification and approval using the AF Form 673. See
   Table 2.3 for technical/ functional coordination rules.
   2.29.1. (45 SW) When a prescribing directive is rescinded, any form(s) prescribed in it are
   considered obsolete until they are prescribed in another publication. At the 45th Space Wing,
   approval and rescission authority resides at the approval official level, 45 SW/CC or 45
   SW/CV, that issued the publication. This authority may not be delegated. Recommend OPR
   coordinate with other affected offices/agencies. Attach coordination (E-mail, memorandum,
   etcetera) to the AF Form 673 or memorandum. Send memorandum or AF Form 673, Air
   Force Publications/Forms Action Request, requesting rescission to 45 SCS/SCOKC.
   2.29.2. The OPR must submit the properly completed and signed AF Form 673 to the
   publications/ forms manager ;OPRs for departmental publications will submit directly to
   AFDPO (AFDPO-PPP@pentagon.af.mil). Provide disposition instructions on the AF Form
   673, following guidance in AFI 31-401 for classified publications.
       2.29.2.1. If the rescinded publication prescribes an Air Force form or a report, the OPR
       must include this information on the AF Form 673 and send a copy of the request for
 106                                                  AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


       rescission to the information reports management and control office. NOTE: When a
       publication is rescinded, any prescribed forms or reports are rendered obsolete.
       2.29.2.1. (45 SW) If the publication to be rescinded prescribes a form, contact 45
       SCS/SCOKC, the local base forms manager, prior to submitting the request for
       rescission.
       2.29.2.2. If the publication is an AFPD or an AF supplement to a DODD, only the
       SECAF may rescind.
       2.29.2.3. If the publication implements a DOD Issuance, the OPR must clarify on the AF
       Form 673 that the requirements are no longer valid or are met in a separate, active
       publication (list publications, if applicable) and obtain SAF/AAX coordination in
       addition to other technical/functional coordination.
       2.29.2.4. Obsolete publications/forms are listed in the Product Index. Links to obsolete
       publications are removed from the e-Publishing website and AFDPO releases a product
       announcement to notify subscribers of the cancellation. OPRs are encouraged to notify
       affected staff offices when a publication is released, revised, or rescinded and posted on
       the e-Publishing website. The OPR notice should include a statement alerting recipients
       that related publications and/or processes may be affected.
       2.29.2.5. ANG releases the NGB Publications Bulletin for notifying subscribers of
       cancellations            on           the           NGB            Publication site
       (http://www.ngbpdc.ngb.army.mil/publications.htm). A copy of the NGB Publications
       Bulletin is sent to all Publications Distribution Office accounts.
       2.29.2.6. If an expired GM, AFPM, or an outdated supplement is removed from the e-
       Publishing website it is, in effect, cancelled. Any forms prescribed therein and any
       associated visual aids are also rendered obsolete. Since no AF Form 673 will exist for this
       action, the record set will include references to the appropriate sections in this AFI to
       justify the cancellation and "close out" the record set.

Section 2H—Special Publication Systems

2.30. Basis for Setting up a Special Publications System. Special publications exist to fulfill
unique publishing requirements for a narrowly defined audience (i.e. CFETPs, ATs, etc.). These
publications must identify in the opening paragraph their linkage with a parent publication listed
in an AFSC series. This system will not change or supersede any directive publication, form, or
report that a directive publication prescribes. Special publications do not bypass the normal
publishing process.
   2.30.1. Establishing a Special Publications System. Obtain approval to create a
   departmental-level system from SAF/AAX; obtain approval to create a field-level system
   from your local publications/ forms manager. Describe the proposed system, including the
   type of publications you will issue, publication specifications, coordination, certification,
   approval requirements, approximate cost, and proposed distribution. Explain why regular
   publications are not suitable. Reference the directive publication driving the need for the
   special publications system. Any form that the special publications system requires must be
   prescribed in the publication establishing the special system. Once approval has been
AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                               107


   received, work with AFDPO or local publications/forms manager to establish the publishing
   process.
   2.30.1. (45 SW) Contact the publishing management office, 45 SCS/SCOKC, for more
   information and approval to establish a special publication system, if needed.

Section 2I—Records Management

2.31. Managing Records. The execution of processes and procedures prescribed in
publications result in the creation of records that document the business of the Air Force. Your
local records professional will help you identify appropriate records for preservation.
Maintaining an accurate record set for each publication and form issued by the Air Force is a
responsibility mandated by law. The record set for a publication must be maintained in a separate
file from the record set for the prescribed form(s). Record sets for publications and the prescribed
form(s) may be stored in the same location, but the record sets must be kept separate.
Additionally, if preferable, OPRs may retire record sets for previous versions of a publication. If
discrepancies exist in the Records Disposition Schedule (RDS), follow instructions in AFI 33-
364, Records Disposition-Procedures and Responsibilities, and AFMAN 33-363 to update the
RDS.
   2.31.1. OPRs must ensure all records created and collected as a result of compliance with
   this publication are correctly identified in the RDS located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
   af61a/afrims/afrims/.
   2.31.2. Add the following to the opening paragraph of all publications: "Ensure that all
   records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
   accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and
   disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Information Management System
   (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
   af61a/afrims/afrims/."
   2.31.3. As part of mandatory coordination, the local records manager will check the
   processes prescribed in the publication against the RDS. If the RDS requires modification,
   coordination may be delayed.
   2.31.4. The following provides an overview for those developing record sets for
   publications. Those responsible for maintaining records sets must follow guidance in AFI 33-
   364; AFMAN 33-363; and AFI 33-322, Records Management Program, for making,
   maintaining, and disposing of records.
   2.31.4. (45 SW) Record Sets of Standard and Specialized Publications. The official record
   set of 45 SW publications is maintained by 45 SCS/SCOKC.
       2.31.4.1. OPRs at the HAF who develop publications are responsible for maintaining the
       official record sets. Field publications/forms managers, in conjunction with the senior
       communications and information manager, will determine who will maintain record sets
       locally. OPRs for departmental publications that are authored in the field must maintain
       the record set for that publication in accordance with local guidance from the
       publications/forms manager. Maintain a file arranged numerically by subject series for
       each publication that includes the following:
 108                                                  AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


          2.31.4.1.1. Records for AFPMs and GMs that are converted into "permanent"
          publications must become part of the record set for the permanent publication.
          AFPMs and GMs that are not converted into permanent publications should be
          disposed of in the same way as other memoranda.
       2.31.4.2. The original AF Form 673. AFDPO will maintain a copy of the AF Form 673
       for publications developed at the HAF (includes both the Air Staff and the Secretariat) for
       their own records; OPRs for departmental publications and forms generated at the HAF
       are responsible for maintaining their own record sets. Field OPRs developing
       departmental publications must maintain and/or retire the original AF Form 673 in the
       record set in accordance with local guidance from the publications/forms manager. When
       a publication and form(s) are circulated for coordination/action on the same AF Form 673
       or AF IMT 1768 (SSS), keep the original in the publication record set and a copy of that
       record in the form record set.
       2.31.4.3. A copy of the published version of the publication with all revisions (ICs, ACs,
       AFPM/GMs) (NOTE: Rescinded , superseded, or obsolete versions will be place in
       inactive files and disposed of IAW the RDS and AFI 33-364);
       2.31.4.4. All documents that show coordination, comments, and other actions, such as
       changes (ICs, ACs, and rewrites), exemptions, waivers, suggestions, etc., for the
       publication;
       2.31.4.5. A copy of each AF Form 673 used during biennial reviews for the publication;
       2.31.4.6. Any additional forms required to process the publication (such as forms
       required when developing a printed product; the AF IMT 130, Application for a Report
       Control System (RCS), if used; or the DD 67, Form Processing Action Request, if making
       changes to a DOD form); and,
       2.31.4.7. If the publication directly implements a DOD Issuance, a copy of the signed
       and dated SD106, [DOD] Directives System Coordination Record, the Air Force
       memorandum with comments, the draft Issuance, and the final (signed) Issuance.
   2.31.5. Refer to the RDS (https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/), AFI 33-364,
   AFMAN 33-363, and AFI 33-322 for guidance on creating, maintaining, retiring, and
   disposing of record sets, including electronic record sets and record sets for publications
   falling under the federal vital records program.

Section 2J—Establishing a Functional Publications Library (FPL)

2.32. Definition.
   2.32.1. Commanders of organizations involved in flight operations are specifically
   authorized to establish and maintain FPLs, containing departmental and field-level
   publications. The library will contain a copy of this instruction, the Product Index listing of
   included publications, and the product announcements.
       2.32.1.1. FPLs must link to electronic publications and forms available on the e-
       Publishing website. Classified/FOUO publications and forms may be posted directly to
       an FPL or printed.
AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                            109


   2.32.2. Flight operations commanders may establish FPLs by providing written notification
   to the servicing publishing manager. Identify the activity responsible for the library, its
   location, and appoint a primary and alternate library custodian. Officials establishing FPLs
   will ensure custodians are properly trained on publications management. Custodians are
   responsible for ensuring FPL contents are both current and essential.
2.33. Availability of FPL Publications. Publications kept in an FPL may be loaned to
authorized persons for official use. Loaning publications is optional and depends on local needs.
Do not allow the general public to view, copy, or borrow any publication from an FPL (DOD
5400.7-R_AFSUP1). Since FPLs are not open to the public, FOUO publications may be filed
with other publications.
2.34. Obtaining Publications. Request paper-based publications from the Document
Automation Production Service (DAPS) at unit expense. The e-Publishing website provides a
link to the DAPS website for easy access to this bulk printing service.
2.35. Maintaining an FPL. FPL custodians will review product announcements and the
Product Index on the e-Publishing website to ensure publications contained in the library are
current and essential. Custodians will regularly review and inventory the contents of the FPL to
ensure publications are current and essential. Document the inventory, discrepancies noted,
corrective action taken, and individual conducting inventory. Dispose of custodial records
according to guidance in AFI 33-322.

                                           Chapter 3

                                  FORMS MANAGEMENT

Section 3A—Overview

3.1. General. This section establishes Air Force guidance, assigns responsibilities, and provides
specific procedures for the management of Air Force forms. It applies to all media of forms,
whether paper or electronic. It covers the complete lifecycle management of forms from creation,
distribution, use, review, and revision to cancellation. The use of social security numbers within
AF forms shall be reduced or eliminated wherever possible in accordance with AFI 33-332.
   3.1.1. Definition of a Form. Per DOD Instruction 7750.07, DOD Forms Management
   Program, a form is a fixed arrangement of captioned spaces designed for entering and
   extracting prescribed information. Air Force forms are tools used for the collection,
   recording, and/or extraction of information whereby a predetermined set of data fields have
   been established and defined to meet a definitive Air Force purpose or objective. Official Air
   Force form types are defined in Section 3B. Prescribed forms require an AF Form 673, a
   control number, and a record set; non-prescribed forms do not require an AF Form 673, a
   control number, or a record set, although maintenance of a record set may be helpful to
   owners and users of non-prescribed forms.
       3.1.1.1. Previously, IMTs and forms were used synonymously. The IMT designator is
       being phased out; it will continue to appear until all publications and forms bearing that
       reference are updated.
   3.1.2. Only civilian employees (including direct-hire foreign national employees, but not
   including contractors or indirect-hire foreign national employees) and/or military members of
   the Air Force are authorized to serve as the POC for, provide coordination on, certify, and /or
   approve official Air Force publications and forms, including interservice publications where
   the Air Force serves as the lead service.
   3.1.3. Waiver requests regarding form use or processing must be submitted to the form OPR;
   send requests via e-mail or memorandum, explaining the need for the waiver. If deemed
   necessary by the OPR, the waiver request may be elevated within the organization for review
   and approval. If the waiver is granted, the waiver must be filed with the record set. A waiver
   remains in effect until the OPR cancels it in writing, the form is updated or canceled, or the
   waiver expires (the expiration date must be specified in the documentation granting the
   waiver). Include a statement in the opening paragraph of the prescribing publication if no
   waivers are authorized for forms prescribed therein.

Section 3B—Types of Forms

3.2. Types of Forms. The type of form is determined by the scope of its intended use and is
indicated by the form designation (e.g. AF Form 673, AFMC Form 226). If the scope of users
expands or contracts, the form should be redesignated and reprocessed as necessary.
AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                          111

Prescribed Forms
Type               Description                    Issued by
One-time            Forms that satisfy a one-      All levels
                    time requirement, are not
                    reused or reprinted, and are
                    obsolete when the
                    expiration date is met. The
                    OPR distributes the forms
                    directly to activities
                    required to complete the
                    project. Place "One-time"
                    in parentheses following
                    the form number and show
                    the expiration date next to
                    it (e.g., (One-time, Expires
                    20 January 2006)). The
                    expiration date must not
                    exceed 1 year. OPRs
                    disseminate one-time
                    forms.
 Test                Test forms are established    All levels
                     to be used for a limited
                     period of time so they may
                     be evaluated before
                     becoming permanent. Life
                     of a test form may not
                     exceed 1 year. The OPR is
                     responsible for converting
                     these forms to a permanent
                     form by no later than the
                     expiration date. If not
                     converted to a permanent
                     form, they automatically
                     become obsolete on the
                     expiration date. State
                     "Test" in parentheses
                     following the form number
                     and show the expiration
                     date next to it (e.g., Test,
                     Expires 20 January 2006).
                     OPRs disseminate test
                     forms.

  Prescribed Forms
  Type                          Description                  Issued by
  Morale, Welfare, Recreation     Forms used in the           MWRS offices
  and Services (MWRS)             operation of the MWRS for
                                  internally imposed
                                  requirements. Give forms
                                  management support to
                                  MWRS activities on a
                                  case-by-case basis. The
                                  MWRS activity pays any
                                  printing costs.
  NOTE: Some actions may require use of non-Air Force forms, such as DOD forms (DD
  forms), standard government forms (SFs), optional forms (OFs), General Services
  Administration forms (GSA forms), General Accounting Office forms (GAO forms), etc.
  Users will be instructed when use of non-Air Force forms is necessary. AFDPO may assist
  OPRs with other types of forms, but does not monitor forms posted on non-Air Force
  websites.
3.3. Items Not Managed as Forms (per guidance in DODI 7750. 07):
   3.3.1. Forms used exclusively for cryptological activities.
   3.3.2. Forms used only once as part of a survey.
   3.3.3. Formatted documents that are largely narrative in nature where the space needed by
   respondents to furnish the desired information varies substantially, such as a comment
   matrix, worksheet, classroom evaluations, or permission slip. EXCEPTION: Manage these
   types of documents as prescribed forms if they solicit information covered by the Privacy Act
   of 1974, collect information from the public, or require Office of Management and Budget
   (OMB) approval (see AFI 33-332).
   3.3.4. Formatted documents without spaces for entering information, such as instruction
   sheets and bulletins, pamphlets, notices, contract clause sheets, placards, certain tags and
   labels, pattern letters, guide letters, and form letters.
   3.3.5. Tools used for the collection, recording, and/or extraction of information whereby a
   predetermined set of data fields have been established and defined to meet a definitive AF
   purpose or objective that are not prescribed in an official publication or otherwise defined in
   this instruction, such as login screens or meeting sign-in sheets.

Section 3C—Form Development

3.4. Official Form Repository. The e-Publishing website is the official source for obtaining
prescribed/ adopted forms generated by Air Force OPRs, both electronic and physical, with the
exception of ANG wing/subunit prescribed forms and those generated below the wing/base level.
Because a restricted/classified departmental publishing site is not yet available, field publishing
activities may post electronic classified and FOUO forms on the local headquarters SIPRNET
site. All classified and FOUO forms posted on a headquarters SIPRNET site must be listed under
an unclassified title in the Product Index on the e-Publishing website.
 114                                                  AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


3.4. (45 SW)Official Form Repository. Air Force e-Publishing web site is the official
repository for current publications Air Force wide. The official backup repository for 45th Space
Wing publications is https://www.patrick.af.mil/. WARNING: Using publications accessed
from sources other than the official source sites could result in outdated or incorrect guidance.
   3.4.1. "Stocked and Issued" forms are distributed directly by the OPR. The office symbol
   and mailing address of the OPR are listed after the form title in the Product Index; users must
   submit requests directly to the OPR. The OPR is responsible for informing AFDPO when a
   reprint is necessary.
   3.4.2. ―Stocked and Used‖ forms are distributed by the OPR only within the primary
   organization, and used only by that activity. The OPR is responsible for informing AFDPO
   when a reprint is necessary.
   3.4.3. ANG field publications will be submitted to the local wing forms managers, and are
   not sent to AFDPO for processing or posting. The official repository for ANG forms is the
   NGB-DMJ-P (http://www.ngbpdc.ngb.army.mil/forms.htm).
   3.4.4. (Added-45 SW) In the event of internet failure resulting in non-access to the official
   Air                  Force               publishing                website                 at
   https://eis.afspc.af.mil/unit/45sw/45scs/SiteDirectory/sco/default.aspx, the official backup
   internet repository for 45th Space Wing publications is \\P425FP2\45SWEPL.
3.5. Prescribing a Form. A new form and the prescribing publication must be published and
distributed simultaneously. This is not the case for revised forms. The prescribing publication:
   3.5.1. Directs organizations and individuals to use the form.
   3.5.2. Cites the form designation, number, and title, (e.g., AF Form 673, Air Force
   Publication/Form Action Request) the first time the form is mentioned. Thereafter, only cite
   the designation and number (i.e., AF Form 673), unless the title would clarify the text.
   3.5.3. States the purpose of the form, how to complete it (if necessary), and how to submit it.
   3.5.4. Explains where to submit supply requests if the form is printed.
   3.5.5. Lists prescribed forms by form designation, number and title in the "Prescribed
   Forms" paragraph of the publication and on the AF Form 673 (Section I). ("Prescribed
   Forms" and "Adopted Forms" will be the last two paragraphs of the publication.)
   3.5.6. Do not include a copy of the prescribed form(s) within the publication unless
   absolutely necessary. This will help ensure version control, and may eliminate a need to
   update the publication each time a form is revised. If it is necessary to include a copy of the
   form, show sample entries.
   3.5.6. (45 SW) Forms. Sample IMTs/forms are not used within publications published by
   45 SCS/SCOKC. Use written instructions for each block/section of the IMT/form. Blank
   IMTs/forms within publications are prohibited.
   3.5.7. The prescribing publication does not need to be revised when a form is revised unless
   instructions related to the revised form need to be updated.
   3.5.8. If a form at any level collects Privacy Act information it must be prescribed in an
   official publication and managed in accordance with Privacy Act guidance (see AFI 33-332).
AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                              115


3.6. Creating a Form. Forms Air Force-wide are designed using standard software acquired by
AFDPO and disseminated to all MAJCOM/FOA/DRU publications/formsmanagers.
MAJCOM/FOA/DRU publications/forms managers may further distribute the forms software, if
desired, to individuals designated by the publications/forms managers. All form control numbers
are assigned by local publications/forms managers and the records should be filed numerically
by the form number. Form numbers are assigned sequentially. To ensure forms are developed
correctly:
   3.6.1. Identify all necessary data fields and create a sample form. OPRs will need to justify
   the need for the form, the data fields collected, and specify any printing and/or distribution
   requirements during coordination.
       3.6.1.1. Insert a releasability statement on the bottom of the form only if releasability is
       restricted (either when blank or when filled out). Examples of releasability statements
       include "RELEASABILITY: Access to this form is restricted: this publication may be
       released to NATO members only"; "RELEASABILITY: Access to this form is
       restricted: this publication may not be released to foreign nationals";
       "RELEASABILITY: Access to this form is restricted: this form is classified/FOUO;
       requests for accessibility must be approved by the OPR," etc. The statement must be
       prefaced with the phrase "RELEASABILITY: Access to this form is restricted."
       3.6.1.2. Formats, definitions, data types, etc. already exist for many information fields
       commonly used in government forms. OPRs and forms designers should consult the
       DOD Metadata Registry to determine what form fields have been standardized and use
       standardized fields whenever possible. The DOD Metadata Registry is accessible at
       https://metadata.dod.mil/mdrPortal; click on the "Data Element" tab to access
       standardized fields.
   3.6.2. The prototype used during coordination and the final version will be designed in
   conjunction with the local publications/forms manager.
   3.6.3. Utilize desktop software, such as Microsoft® applications, whenever possible to
   develop office forms. Office forms may also be created with the use of standard AF form
   software.
   3.6.4. The form manager will assign the date. AFDPO is the forms manager for HAF OPRs;
   dates assigned by AFDPO which will not exceed seven (7) business days after the
   publications/forms manager has received complete and correct materials from the OPR.
   Development work on the form may be completed while the form is routed for coordination
   or prior to coordination. Form OPRs at the HAF will complete development work during
   coordination; when form OPRs at the HAF submit the prototype to AFDPO for coordination,
   AFDPO will complete the development work at that time. The form date is the effective date;
   Air Force forms are not considered effective until they are released to users IAW this
   Instruction. AFDPO will alert the local publications/forms manager and the OPR when a new
   or revised form is posted on the e-Publishing website. OPRs are encouraged to notify
   affected staff offices when a form is rescinded or when a new or revised form is posted on
   the e-Publishing website. The OPR notice should include a statement alerting recipients that
   related publications and/ or processes may be affected.

3.7. Adopting a Form. You may adopt an existing form prescribed in one publication (Air
Force or other government publication) for use in another publication. Adopted forms already
exist and are available from the e-Publishing website, the Publishing Distribution Center (PDC),
or, if adopting a form created by a different government agency, the appropriate agency’s
website. You may refer users to the prescribing publication for instructions on completing and
processing the form, adding additional instructions, if necessary. To determine the prescribing
publication of an Air Force form, click on the ―information‖ icon in the form entry on the e-
Publishing website.
   3.7.1. Cite the form designator and number within the publication, including the long title in
   italics at first use; include the full citation in the "Adopted Forms" paragraph (e.g. AF Form
   673, Air Force Publication/Form Action Request). List adopted forms in the "Adopted
   Forms" paragraph of the publication ("Prescribed Forms" and "Adopted Forms" will be the
   last two paragraphs of the publication) and on the AF Form 673.
   3.7.2. If you adopt a form created by another government agency, you may be subject to that
   agency’s guidance. Work with the forms manager of the agency responsible for the form to
   ensure that the Air Force guidance/process aligns with that agency’s guidance/process. DOD
   forms created in IBM software must include the DOD disclaimer.
   3.7.3. If you intend to use an adopted form for a purpose not intended by the OPR, or you
   intend to alter the appearance of an adopted form, you must gain written permission from the
   form’s OPR to alter the use of the form.
   3.7.4. Overprint (pre-fill blocks with standard information) an electronic or physical form
   when the number of man-hours saved in filling in the form justifies the extra cost of
   overprinting the fill-in data. Do not alter lines or captions, or add blocks and captions to an
   existing form as this action is a revision of the original form design. This guidance applies to
   both physical and electronic forms. Insert a statement at the bottom of overprinted forms
   indicating the activity responsible for the overprinted material (e.g., "919 MDS Modified
   Overprint.").
   3.7.5. Functional areas implementing information systems that incorporate existing forms
   must obtain written approval from the OPR. The system maintainer ensures the accuracy of
   forms used in the system.
3.8. Licensing a Report Control Symbol (RCS). Internal Air Force information requirements
are licensed with a RCS number IAW AFI 33-324. Insert the RCS field, if applicable, in the
upper right corner of the form inside the margin. The local publications/forms manager will
consult with the local reports control manager who will determine if an RCS is applicable to the
form during the design phase. See AFI 33-324 for more information, including interagency
reporting, public use, forms, internal reporting, and use of the AF Form 130, Application for a
Reports Control Symbol (RCS).
3.9. Form Software Licenses. All forms must have a software license before being placed on
the e-Publishing website. NOTE: DD or other agency forms do not have software licenses unless
they are designed using the standard Air Force software.
   3.9.1. (DELETED)
AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                               117


   3.9.2. The Form Viewer is openly available to any party with a valid requirement to access
   Air Force forms. It is available for download directly from the e-Publishing website.
      3.9.2.1. Form Designers will require a licensed version of the viewer.
      3.9.2.2. Applications Process Interface (API) licensing will be issued as required.

Section 3D—Legal and Security Requirements

3.10. Requirements and Considerations.
   3.10.1. Privacy Act of 1974 . Forms that collect personal data from individuals for inclusion
   in a Privacy Act (PA) system of records (a collection of records retrieved by an individual’s
   name or personal identifier), and forms that request the individual to enter or verify the social
   security number, must contain a Privacy Act Statement (PAS). The PAS allows the
   individual completing the form to make an informed decision about whether to furnish the
   information. The use of social security numbers within AF forms shall be reduced or
   eliminated wherever possible in accordance with AFI 33-332. Coordinate all proposed new
   or revised forms that collect personal data with the Privacy Act Officer (PAO) and/or
   servicing legal office on the AF Form 673. The PAO will assist with developing the PAS.
      3.10.1.1. Display PAS on the first page of the form, under the title if possible.
      3.10.1.2. Computer Matching Program. Computer matching is the electronic comparison
      of records from two or more automated systems between Federal agencies, state, and
      local governments for verifying benefits, eligibility, and for debt collection purposes.
      Records involved include those from personnel and payroll systems and Federal benefit
      programs. If the information on the form is subject to computer matching, incorporate an
      appropriate warning into the PAS.
   3.10.2. United States Postal Service (USPS) Requirements. Forms used as mailers must meet
   USPS requirements. Refer to DODI 4525.8_AFSUP1, DOD Official Mail Manual, for
   requirements.
   3.10.3. Complying with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. All forms must be Section
   508 compliant, as established in AFI 33-129. AFDPO is responsible for ensuring all products
   posted on the e-Publishing website are Section 508 compliant. Local publications/forms
   managers are responsible for ensuring products not posted to the e- Publishing website are
   Section 508 compliant. See AFI33-129 for guidance on making forms Section 508 compliant.
   3.10.4. Guidelines for Classified, Accountable, Storage Safeguarded, and FOUO forms.
   Anyone requesting the creation of these forms must ensure the forms have the required
   markings (see AFI 31-401 and DoD 5200.1-R). AFDPO will identify these forms in the
   numerical listing on the e-Publishing website. (No longer exists)
      3.10.4.1. Classified Forms. Avoid creating forms that disclose classified information and
      classified titles. When a form title is classified, create an unclassified title for reference
      purposes. When designing a classified blank form, show the overall classification of the
      information at the top and bottom of the form design. If the form will become classified
      when filled in, leave sufficient space for the overall classification marking by adding the
      notation " ___When Filled In" outside the margins at the top and bottom of each page of
 118                                                 AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


       the form. Allow space for entering associated markings, classification authority, and
       downgrading or declassification instructions if deemed necessary by the requester.
       3.10.4.2. Accountable Forms. Some blank forms can jeopardize installation/national
       security or could be used to defraud or allow false claims against the Government;
       therefore, you must control, safeguard, and account for these forms. Contact AFDPO for
       further guidance on handling accountable forms (AFDPO-PPP@pentagon.af.mil).
       3.10.4.3. Storing Safeguarded Forms. Safeguarded forms are not releasable outside DOD
       because they could be put to unauthorized or fraudulent use (e.g. general officer
       stationary). You need not account for each individual form, but you must store blank
       forms in a secure area. Contact AFDPO for further guidance on storing safeguarded
       forms (AFDPO-PPP@pentagon.af.mil).
       3.10.4.4. FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Forms. Mark and protect these forms as directed
       in DoD 5200.1-R.

Section 3E—Coordination Requirements

3.11. Coordination. New and obsolete forms marked for cancellation require mandatory and
functional coordination. Revised forms require mandatory coordination.
   3.11.1. Drafts of new forms should circulate with the prescribing publication for
   coordination. Follow guidance and procedures described in Section 2D to properly
   coordinate your form with the publication. If only the form requires revision or is marked for
   cancellation, you may circulate your form independently of the prescribing publication; see
   Table 3.2 for mandatory coordination on independently coordinated forms, see Table 2.3 for
   technical/functional coordination.
       3.11.1.1. List all adopted and prescribed forms in block 11 of the AF Form 673, and fill
       out blocks 12 through 13 accordingly. If prescribing multiple forms, make use of block
       32 to indicate classification (block 12a), control status (block 12b), and printing
       requirements (block 13) for each.
       3.11.1.2. OPRs must fill out form-specific information during regular two-year reviews
       or special out-of-cycle reviews. Make use of block 32 to include any information on the
       status of adopted and/or prescribed forms that does not fit in the regular blocks.
   3.11.2. The DoD forms manager granted the Air Force an exception/waiver on May 27,
   2008, allowing sole use of the AF Form 673 for all actions on Air Force forms. Use of the
   DD 67 form is only required when action is taken on a non-Air Force form for which the Air
   Force serves as the OPR. Submit an AF Form 673 for new, revised, or obsolete (marked for
   cancellation) forms. The completed AF Form 673 and the form must be submitted to the
   local publications/forms manager for processing. The HAF publishing manager for
   departmental forms is AFDPO (AFDPO-PPP@pentagon.af.mil). See paragraph 2.18.2 for
   guidance on filling out the AF Form 673.
       3.11.2.1. If requesting an action on a DOD form for which the Air Force serves as the
       OPR submit a completed DD Form 67. DD Form 67 is prescribed by DOD 7750.7-M,
       DOD Forms Management Program Procedures Manual; refer to that publication and
       consult your publications/forms manager for instructions on completing DD Form 67.
AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                                 119


        3.11.2.2. The certification and approval authorities for forms are the same as those for
        the prescribing publication.

Section 3F—Keeping Forms Current

3.12. Form Revision. An AF Form 673 showing coordination and certification is required to
alter the contents of the form. Submit the 673 and the draft form to the forms manager for
processing and posting (AFDPO is the forms manager for HAFOPRs (AFDPO-
PPP@pentagon.af.mil)). The revised form will be redated. If applicable, indicate at the bottom
of the form any supersession or disposition instructions, and indicate on the form that superseded
forms are not authorized for use (include the date of the superseded form). EXCEPTION: OPRs
may work directly with forms designers to make any purely technical "fixes" to electronic forms
(e.g., alignment of fields, order of tabs, enabling for digitalsignatures, etc.). Technical fixes must
not alter the layout or the purpose of the form; forms updated in this manner will not be redated
and do not require a supersession line. Submit technical fixes to forms designers in writing (via
email or memorandum). Changes to the layout or the purpose of the form do require
coordination. NOTE: The OPR must ensure that guidance related to altered forms in the
 120                                                   AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


prescribing publication is correct. OPRs are encouraged to notify affected staff offices when a
form is revised and posted to the e-Publishing website.
   3.12.1. Forms will be reviewed every two years along with the prescribing publication.
   OPRs will be asked to provide the form status on an AF Form 673 generated by the
   publications/forms manger. Both the OPR and the certifying official must sign the AF Form
   673 during two-year and special reviews.
3.13. Rescinding a Form. A form becomes obsolete when another form supersedes it, when the
OPR rescinds it, or when the prescribing publication is rescinded. If the OPR wishes to continue
use of the form, it must be prescribed in an active publication. Obsolete publications/forms are
listed in the Product Index. Links to obsolete forms are removed from the e-Publishing website
and AFDPO releases a product announcement to notify subscribers of the cancellation. ANG
releases the NGB Publications Bulletin for notifying subscribers of cancellations on the NGB
Publication site (http://www.ngbpdc.ngb.army.mil/publications.htm). A copy of the NGB
Publications Bulletin is sent to all Publications Distribution Office accounts. OPRs are
encouraged to notify affected staff offices when a form is rescinded. The OPR notice should
include a statement alerting recipients that related publications and/or processes may be affected.
   3.13.1. If you are canceling the prescribing publication the prescribed form will be canceled
   at the same time—it is not necessary to submit more than one AF Form 673; simply clarify in
   the "Additional Information" block that the cancellation applies to both the publication and
   the form. If you are rescinding a form or a report but maintaining the prescribing publication,
   the OPR must complete mandatory coordination (Table 3.2), obtain certification and
   approval, submit a completed AF Form 673 to the publications/forms manager, and send a
   copy of the request for rescission to the information reports management and control office.
   If the form is classified, reference AFI 31-401 for actions required to rescind.
   3.13.2. OPRs are responsible for ensuring that any references made to obsolete forms, either
   prescribed or adopted, are removed from active publications. See Section 2F on making
   changes to publications.

Section 3G—Records Management

3.14. Records Management. The execution of processes and procedures prescribed in
publications results in the creation of records that document the business of the Air Force.
Maintaining an accurate record set for each form issued by the Air Force is a responsibility
mandated by law. The record set for a form must be maintained in a separate file from the record
set for the prescribing publication. Record sets for publications and the prescribed form(s) may
be stored in the same location, but the record sets must be kept separate. Adopted forms do not
require a record set. If discrepancies exist in the Records Disposition Schedule (RDS), follow
instructions in AFI 33-364, Records Disposition-Procedures and Responsibilities, and AFMAN
33-363 to update the RDS.
   3.14.1. OPRs must ensure all records created and collected as a result of compliance with
   this publication are correctly identified in the RDS located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
   af61a/afrims/afrims/.
   3.14.2. As part of mandatory coordination, the local records manager will review the form.
AFI33-360_45 SWSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                           121


   3.14.3. The following provides an overview for those developing record sets for
   publications/forms. Those responsible for maintaining records sets must follow guidance in
   AFI 33-364; AFMAN 33-363; and AFI 33-322, Records Management Program, for making,
   maintaining, and disposing of records.
       3.14.3.1. OPRs at the HAF who develop forms are responsible for maintaining the
       official record sets. Field publications/forms managers, in conjunction with the senior
       communications and information manager, will determine who will maintain record sets
       locally. Maintain a file arranged numerically for each form that includes the following:
       3.14.3.2. A copy of each published version of the form. If the form is circulated for
       coordination without the prescribing publication, include the original AF Form 673 in the
       record set. AFDPO will maintain a copy of the AF Form 673 for publications or forms
       developed at the HAF (includes both the Air Staff and the Secretariat) for their own
       records; OPRs for departmental forms generated at the HAF are responsible for
       maintaining their own record sets. Field OPRs developing departmental forms will have
       their publications/forms managers maintain and/or retire the original AF Form 673 in the
       record set. When a publication and form(s) are circulated for coordination/ action on the
       same AF Form 673 or SSS, keep the original in the publication record set and a copy of
       that record in the form record set.
       3.14.3.3. A copy of the published version of the prescribing publication and form.
       3.14.3.4. All documents that show coordination, comments, and other actions, such as
       changes, exemptions, waivers, suggestions, etc., for the form.
       3.14.3.5. A copy of the AF Form 673 used during each two-year review (the original
       should reside in the record set for the publication).
       3.14.3.6. Any additional forms required to process the form (such as forms required
       when developing a printed product; the AF IMT, Application for a Report Control System
       (RCS), if used; or the DD 67, Form Processing Action Request, if making changes to a
       DOD form).
       3.14.3.7. Copies of form-related waivers granted and system form approvals (see
       paragraph 3.7.5).
   3.14.4. Refer to AFI 33-364; AFMAN 33-363; and AFI 33-322 for guidance on creating,
   maintaining, retiring, and disposing of electronic record sets.
