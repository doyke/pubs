                                           Chapter 1

                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. References, Abbreviations, Acronyms, and Terms. See Attachment 1.
1.2. Procedures:
   1.2.1. Flight Examiners (FE) will use the evaluation criteria in this instruction for conducting
   all flight and emergency procedure evaluations. To ensure standard and objective
   evaluations, flight examiners will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation
   criteria.
   1.2.2. All evaluations fall under the Instrument (INSTM), Qualification (QUAL), Mission
   (MSN), Instructor (INSTR), or SPOT criteria in AFI 11-202V2. INSTM applies to pilots
   only. Schedule all evaluation activity to occur on one sortie to the greatest extent possible.
   1.2.3. Special Qualification. Special qualification evaluations are administered for events
   that are not universal to all members in that crew position. Special qualification evaluations
   may be conducted separately or in conjunction with the qualification/mission evaluations.
   Requisites for special qualification evaluations will be specified in Chapter 2, Evaluation
   Requirements.
      1.2.3.1. Special qualifications result in an AF Form 8. Document special qualifications as
      a separate entry SPOT evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2. Further description of the
      specific events evaluated will be included in the mission description section of the
      comments block of the AF Form 8.
      1.2.3.2. Although a unit may maintain 100 percent of its crewmembers qualified, this
      documentation is still required due to unit interfly and permanent change of station
      issues.
   1.2.4. FEs may use video recording (VR) devices to reconstruct/evaluate the mission.
   1.2.5. FEs will brief examinees on the evaluation purpose and conduct and the evaluation
   areas prior to flight. Examinees will accomplish required flight planning for the evaluation
   IAW requirements for their crew position. Examinees will furnish FEs a copy of necessary
   flight logs, target folders, and other required mission materials.
   1.2.6. FEs should not occupy a primary crew position during evaluations except when it
   would afford the best opportunity to conduct INSTR evaluations.
   1.2.7. Areas required to complete an evaluation are indicated with an "R" on applicable
   evaluation criteria tables. When an area cannot be evaluated in flight and is required to
   complete the check, it will be evaluated by an alternate method; such as an Aircrew Training
   Device (ATD) or oral examination. Document the use of alternate evaluation methods in the
   AF Form 8 comments section. Individuals with an expired or non-current evaluation require
   supervision to perform flight activities.
   1.2.8. FEs will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the flight. The debrief will include the
   examinee's overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified)
   and any recommended additional training.
6                                                      AFI11-2MQ-1V2 28 NOVEMBER 2008


1.3. Grading Instructions. Performance standards are in AFI 11-202V2, and this instruction.
    1.3.1. FEs will compare examinee performance for each area accomplished during the
    evaluation with the standards provided in this volume and assign an appropriate grade for the
    area. FEs will derive the overall flight evaluation grade from the area grades based on a
    composite for the observed events and tasks IAW this volume.
    1.3.2. FEs will base tolerances for in-flight parameters on conditions of smooth air and a
    stable aircraft. Do not consider momentary deviations from tolerances provided the examinee
    applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flying safety. FEs will
    consider cumulative deviations when determining an overall grade.
    1.3.3. When grading criteria specify evaluation of airspeed and the flight manual lists only a
    minimum/ maximum airspeed for that area, the examinee will brief the desired airspeed.
    1.3.4. FEs must exercise judgment when the wording of areas is subjective and when
    specific situations are not covered.
    1.3.5. An unqualified grade in any of the critical areas identified by this instruction requires
    an overall unqualified grade.
    1.3.6. FE judgment will be the determining factor in arriving at the overall grade.
    1.3.7. The following general criteria apply during all phases of flight except as noted for
    specific events and instrument final approaches:
       1.3.7.1. Q:
           1.3.7.1.1. Altitude: +/-150 feet.
           1.3.7.1.2. Airspeed: +10/-5 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS).
           1.3.7.1.3. Course: +/-20 degrees/1.5 nautical miles (NM) (whichever is greater).
       1.3.7.2. Q-:
           1.3.7.2.1. Altitude: +/- 200 feet.
           1.3.7.2.2. Airspeed: +15/-7 KIAS.
           1.3.7.2.3. Course: +/-30 degrees/3 NM (whichever is greater).
       1.3.7.3. U: Exceeded Q- limits.
1.4. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). FEs will use an ATD to conduct EPEs, if
available and EPE capable. If not using an ATD, administer the EPE orally. This evaluation will
include areas commensurate with examinee's qualifications.
    1.4.1. Include the following items on all EPEs:
       1.4.1.1. Evaluate Pilots and Sensor Operators (SO) on general aircraft and mission
       systems knowledge as required by their crew position.
       1.4.1.2. Evaluate at least two emergency procedures and all CAPs per applicable phase
       of flight. Crewmembers will not be evaluated on events in which they are not
       specifically trained (e.g. takeoff and landing emergency procedures and associated CAPS
       will not be evaluated unless conducting a SPOT for Launch and Recovery (LR) Special
       Qualification.).
AFI11-2MQ-1V2 28 NOVEMBER 2008                                                                        7


       1.4.1.3. Evaluate crew coordination where applicable.
       1.4.1.4. Evaluate unusual attitude recoveries on all pilot EPEs.
   1.4.2. Tailor MSN evaluation scenarios to situations that could be encountered by the
   examinee while fulfilling his/her unit’s mission tasking. Consider including situations that
   are infrequent or are difficult to replicate when flying the actual aircraft but still fit within the
   examinee’s unit tasking. FEs should include the following additional items on the EPE given
   as a requisite to the mission evaluation.
       1.4.2.1. Basic sensor systems operation.
       1.4.2.2. Safe passage procedures/threat avoidance.
   1.4.3. Unqualified EPE
       1.4.3.1. Place examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade in supervised status until
       completing recommended additional training and/or successfully accomplishing a
       reevaluation.
       1.4.3.2. Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade because of unsatisfactory CAP
       accomplishment will not be permitted to fly in their aircrew position until a successful
       reevaluation is accomplished.
   1.4.4. Use the following grading criteria to grade individual items on EPEs:
       1.4.4.1. Q. Correct performance. Recognizes and corrects errors.
       1.4.4.2. Q-. Safe Performance, but limited in proficiency with errors of omission or
       commission.
       1.4.4.3. U. Performance is unsafe or indicates lack of knowledge or ability.
1.5. Crew Resource Management (CRM). IAW AFI 11-202V2, CRM skills will be evaluated
for all crewmembers during all evaluations in the following areas. (AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew
Resource Management Training Program, may be used as a reference)
   1.5.1. Mission planning/briefing,
   1.5.2. Crew coordination
   1.5.3. Situational awareness/task management.
   1.5.4. Risk management/decision making.
   1.5.5. Communication.
   1.5.6. Mission debriefing
1.6. Examinations.
   1.6.1. Closed book. All closed book questions will come from the MQ-1B Master Question
   File (MQF) or local/theater procedures. At least ten percent of the questions will be from
   local area procedures (local area MQF is optional).
   1.6.2. Critical Action Procedures. This exam will be written from memory. Responses must
   contain all critical action items in proper sequence for all CAPs the crewmember is qualified
   in.

    1.6.3. Open book. Questions are derived from flight manuals and governing command
    directives.
1.7. Flight Publications. Satisfactory performance requires flight publications be current and
properly posted. Evaluate all issued checklists for currency and accuracy on all flight
evaluations. In units that do not issue individual aircrew publications, aircrew members are still
responsible for the accuracy and currency of all publications required for the mission. Units may
specify publications to be evaluated in the unit supplement to AFI 11-202V2.
1.8. Documentation of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR)
Results. Document ISR results in the Mission Description Section of the AF Form 8. Reasons
for unsuccessful attempts must be documented on the AF Form 8.

                               EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General.
     2.1.1. Evaluation Procedures. All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-
     202V2, and this volume. Before the mission briefing, the flight examiner will brief the
     examinee on specific evaluation areas and, if applicable, will inform the pilot in command of
     any special requirements. Use criteria in the chapter for the appropriate crew position for
     evaluations. Units may modify evaluation profiles based on local operating considerations or
     FE judgment to complete the evaluation.
     2.1.2. Evaluation Requirements.
        2.1.2.1. FEs must evaluate all required areas in order to complete the evaluation.
            2.1.2.1.1. Document use of alternate evaluation methods in the AF Form 8,
            Comments section.
            2.1.2.1.2. If the FE determines the required item cannot be adequately evaluated by
            an alternate method, the examinee will require an additional flight to complete the
            evaluation.
        2.1.2.2. An asterisk (*) indicates critical areas (1, 2, 3, 4). A grade of U awarded in any
        critical area requires an overall Q-3 for the evaluation.
        2.1.2.3. Grade all observed areas.
2.2. Pilot Instrument Evaluation. A mission flown according to instrument flight rules (IFR)
(to the extent practical) best fulfills the objective of the INSTM evaluation. The instrument flight
phase will normally be combined with the qualification flight phase. Units may elect to
administer this evaluation on any compatible training mission or combined with the mission
evaluation. Minimum ground phase requisites are:
     2.2.1. Instrument examination.
     2.2.2. CAP examination.
2.3. Qualification Evaluation. A mission evaluating the examinee’s ability to safely and
effectively operate the aircraft and associated subsystems. This evaluation encompasses basic
aircraft handling and basic operation of the sensors. Minimum ground phase requirements are:
