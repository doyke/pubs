3. General Program Information. Patrick AFB will have one CBB each quarter consisting of
nominees from all small units on the base including mission partners and geographically
separated units.
     3.1. SrA BTZ Promotion Boards are held the last month of each quarter (Mar, Jun, Sep, and
     Dec).
     3.2. There is no requirement for any board to use its full quota.
     3.3. A projected BTZ promotion cannot be placed in withhold status. If the squadron
     commander determines a quality indicator of any kind has been identified, he/she can non-
     recommend the member for promotion and the first alternate can be promoted in the original
     selectee’s place if the 45 SW/CC concurs with the request (CBB only). The change of
     promotion status package must be routed through 45 SW/CCC to the 45 SW/CC for
     approval. The package will include an amended board report reflecting the change to
45SWI36-2502 10 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                  5


   promotion status. If the member is from a large unit board, the unit board president may
   make a recommendation to the unit commander to request the alternate receives the
   promotion. If the request is approved, the large unit board president must resubmit BTZ
   meeting minutes to 45 FSS/FSMPD as soon as the request is approved.
4. Quotas. Quotas are based on 15 percent of the total TIG and TIS eligible population listed on
Parts I, II and III of the quarterly BTZ roster. Using Attachment 4 the MPS Chief determines,
approves, and distributes quotas to units. Quotas are computed and distributed as follows:
Computation: Eligible multiplied by 15 percent equals the quota.
Example: 13 eligible x 0.15 = 1.95, or 2 BTZ quotas.
(Note: Fractions of 0.5 or higher are rounded up).

Table 1. Distribution.

6. Board Composition.
   6.1. The CBB is a “records only” board (vs. personal appearance by nominees) and will
   continue combining all eligible members from small units at one central base board (vs.
   separate boards for tenant units in each MAJCOM).
       6.1.1. The board president will be the 45 SW/CCC. If he/she is not available, the 45
       SW/CCC will appoint the board president.
       6.1.2. Board members will be appointed by the board president and will consist of group
       superintendents or their designated representative, and a representative of any tenant unit
       participating in the CBB.
 6                                                         45SWI36-2502 10 SEPTEMBER 2010


        6.1.3. A non-voting recorder appointed by 45 FSS/FSMPD in the enlisted grade of SrA
        or higher.
     6.2. Boards held by large units will consist of the following:
        6.2.1. The board president, as determined IAW paragraph 2.5.2., will appoint the
        following:
        6.2.2. At least three voting board members in the grade of MSgt or higher.
        6.2.3. A non-voting recorder in the enlisted grade of SrA or above.
7. Selection Folders.
     7.1. Commanders of small units are responsible for providing 45 FSS/FSMPD an AF IMT
     1206, selection rip, citations to decorations, checklist (Attachment 7) and a letter signed by
     the unit commander indicating the member has a current fitness test score of 75 or above
     (Attachment 10) for all CBB nominees. 45 FSS/FSMPD will build the folders for each
     board member.
8. Scoring Process.
     8.1. The selection folders will be scored with the following areas: Leadership and Job
     Performance in Primary Duty, Significant Self Improvement, and Base and Community
     Involvement. Each package will receive a score ranging from 6-10 points. Board members
     will score packages in half point (.50) increments if there are less than 10 candidates meeting
     the board. If the board is comprised of 10 or more candidates, the packages will be scored in
     quarter point (.25) increments. Board members are required to break their own ties; no
     package will receive the same score. The scores will be recorded on the score sheet at
     Attachment 6. After the packages are scored, the board members will rank order the
     nominees. With the exception of the CBB President’s scores, the board member’s total
     scores will be added together for a composite board score on the Board President’s score
     sheet (Attachment 5). The nominees will then be sorted in order of merit. The winning
     order of precedence will be from highest composite board score to lowest.
     8.2. In the event of a tie score, the CBB President will break the tie.
9. Processing Errors.
     9.1. Prior to announcement. If a member should have been considered during the current
     quarter board and the error is discovered before promotions are announced, large unit
     commanders will consider the member and adjust selections accordingly (this does not apply
     to members who are gained, and it has been determined they were not considered by their
     losing base; see supplemental BTZ consideration). The CBB will reconvene to consider
     small units eligible and adjust selections accordingly.
     9.2. After announcement. If a member should have been considered during the current
     board and the error is discovered after selections are announced, supplemental promotion
     consideration procedures apply. Adjustments will not be made to the gaining unit/base quota
     if the error is discovered and a member should have been considered by his/her losing base.
     Every effort should be made to ensure the member is considered by the losing unit/base. If
     the losing unit/base has already announced selections, supplemental consideration (with
     current commander recommendation) should be requested by the gaining base.
45SWI36-2502 10 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                 7


10. Supplemental BTZ Consideration.
   10.1. Commanders may request supplemental BTZ consideration for members that should
   have been considered by a previous board and the error was not discovered until after
   promotions were announced. After obtaining unit commander’s recommendation, the MPS
   forwards fully documented supplemental requests to HQ AFPC/DPPPWM for consideration
   via e-mail. It is imperative supplemental BTZ consideration is requested only when the unit
   commander concurs with consideration. Additionally, if the basis for the supplemental
   request is because the member did not receive fair consideration (or was not considered at all
   at their last duty station), contact the losing unit and MPS before requesting supplemental
   consideration, and forward all correspondence along with the supplemental request. This
   will assist HQ AFPC/ DPPPWM in determining if supplemental BTZ consideration is
   appropriate. HQ AFPC/ DPPPWM will respond with further instructions. If selected,
   members may apply for a retroactive change to his/her effective date according to AFI 36-
   2502, Para 1.13.
   10.2. It is the responsibility of the member, supervisor and commander to ensure proper
   identification as an eligible, nomination IAW program policies, and verification of the data
   on the BTZ RIP prior to the board. Supplemental consideration will not be given for the
   following reasons:
       10.2.1. Incorrect data reflected on the BTZ RIP.
       10.2.2. Denied BTZ nomination due to incorrect data reflected on the BTZ RIP.
       10.2.3. BTZ eligibility listing not returned to 45 FSS/FSMPD or individual was
       overlooked and not considered.

                                  BOARD INSTRUCTIONS

A2.1. On the designated board member swear in date, each board member will receive a BTZ
folder with the information outlined in paragraph 8 of this instruction.
A2.2. The selection folders will be scored with the following areas: Leadership and Job
Performance in Primary Duty, Significant Self Improvement, and Base and Community
Involvement. Each package will receive a score ranging from 6-10 points. Board members will
score packages in half point (.50) increments if there are less than 10 candidates meeting the
board. If the board is comprised of 10 or more candidates, the packages will be scored in quarter
point (.25) increments. Board members are required to break their own ties; no package will
receive the same score. The scores will be recorded on the score sheet at Attachment 6. After
the packages are scored, the board members will rank order the nominees. With the exception of
the CBB President’s scores, the board member’s total scores will be added together for a
composite board score on the Board President’s score sheet (Attachment 5). The nominees will
then be sorted in order of merit. The winning order of precedence will be from highest
composite board score to lowest.
A2.3. Board Proceedings.
   A2.3.1. The board president will monitor the entire board process and advise the board
   members on all proceedings.
   A2.3.2. The board president will administer the oath to voting board members and the non-
   voting recorder.
   A2.3.3. The board recorder will collect score sheets and compile a composite board score
   using the score sheet at Attachment 5. The board recorder will then sort the eligible
   members in order of merit from the one with the highest score to the lowest.
   A2.3.4. Board members will not discuss individual nominees’ scores until after the
   composite board score is completed using Attachment 5. This ensures each board member
   scores the record independently and fairly.
   A2.3.5. The board will choose the BTZ selectees, not exceeding the board quota, and a first
   alternate selectee.
