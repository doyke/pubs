This pamphlet series is intended as a load planning guide and provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners (both long range and individual
movement) to load plan aircraft in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). Equipment and methods
listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed. It must be noted that,
unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not standardized, and can vary widely,
even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval, therefore, ultimately rests with the
individual contractor providing airlift services to the DOD.

This pamphlet series enables application of DTR 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation –
Part III Mobility, Appendix V, Aircraft Load Planning and Documentation; as well as AMCI 10-
402, Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). The guidance contained herein is applicable to all USAF,
AFRC, ANG and DOD agencies whenever they are charged with using the CRAF assets
contained herein, in accordance with DOD, inter-service, and/or MAJCOM agreements.

                                            Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose. This pamphlet series is non-directive in nature. It provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners to more efficiently and effectively
load plan aircraft in the CRAF.

1.2. Scope. CRAF aircraft specifications listed herein are current as of the date of this printing.
Equipment and methods listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed.
It must be noted that, unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not
standardized, and can vary widely, even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval,
therefore, ultimately rests with the individual contractor providing airlift services to the
DOD.
1.2.1. Volume 4, Boeing (McDonnell Douglas). AMCPAM 24-2 Volume 4 deals specifically
with aircraft originally manufactured by McDonnell Douglas Corporation. McDonnell Douglas
Corp. first formed in 1967 after the Douglas Co. (founded 1920) and McDonnell Aircraft Corp.
(originating in 1928) merged. Through the last merger into the Boeing Company in 1997, the
Boeing Company has melded the companies founded by aerospace pioneers William Boeing,
Donald Douglas, James McDonnell, James "Dutch" Kindelberger, and Howard Hughes Jr. As of
the date of this publication, the Boeing Company has produced almost 17,000 commercial jet
aircraft alone, with over 12,100 still in service.

1.3. Arrangement. This pamphlet series is designed for easy reference and access to the most
commonly needed information for planning purposes. Essentially, Volume 1 will contain all
information common to the entire CRAF program and most, if not all, carriers. Volumes 2
through 5 will contain information specific to a particular manufacturer’s airframes, with each
sub-volume addendum addressing a different series or type. Each can be referenced separately
from another; however, each addendum needs to be used in conjunction with Volume 1.
1.3.1. Volume 4, Boeing (McDonnell Douglas) Addenda. Volume 4 is not separated from each
subsequent addendum, but is published as a ―cover‖ document along with and as an introduction
for each addendum. The same information for Volume 4 essentially gets republished--unchanged
with each Boeing (McDonnell Douglas) model’s addendum.
1.3.2. Volume 4, Boeing (McDonnell Douglas) Quick Reference Tables. All chapter
descriptions for various models are designed to be used in conjunction with Chapter 2 Quick
Reference Tables. The information in the Quick Reference Tables will generally not be restated
in the expanded chapters as they are meant primarily for pictorial figures.

1.4. Supplements. Changes or supplements to this pamphlet by agencies, other than AMC, are
prohibited. This does not preclude its use as a reference document for preparation of intra-
agency instructional directives.

1.5. Acronyms. An explanation of the acronyms used in this pamphlet is in AMCPAM 24-2,
Volume 1, Attachment 1.

1.7. Description. Addendum C. Boeing (McDonnell Douglas) MD-11 Series.
The MD-11 Series aircraft are wide body, three engine aircraft, designed for medium to long
range. The MD-11 was designed as follow-on to the DC-10, and featured a longer (by about 18.6
feet) fuselage, and redesigned wings from its predecessor. Additionally, the MD-11 Series
incorporated advances in aerodynamics, propulsion, aircraft systems, and cockpit avionics. This
increased performance, reduced operating costs, and reduced the crew from three (on a DC-10)
to two. Production of the MD-11 Series lasted from 1988 to 2001, with 200 models delivered.

There were four basic models of the MD-11 Series, with an additional Extended Range (the MD-
11ER) all-passenger variant.

The MD-11 is the basic, all-passenger model. The MD-11 launched the Series with its first flight
on January 1990. It was type-certified in November 1990, and was the most popular model of the
series, with 131 aircraft manufactured and delivered.

The MD-11F ("F" for freighter), was offered up to customers at the same time as the MD-11,
and shares the same type-certification date. This all-cargo version is the second-most produced in
the MD-11 Series, with 53 originally made, and were the last aircraft manufactured in the Series.
Additionally, with the introduction of the MD-11 Boeing Converted Freighter (BCF) program, it
is unknown how many MD-11 passenger or combi airplanes will be converted to freighters.

MD-11C ("C" for Combi). The MD-11C was yet another option offered when the MD-11
program launched. The Combi design allowed the MD-11C to carry both passengers and cargo at
the same time in the main compartment. Since it had this dual-feature, the MD-11C's main
compartment cargo door was placed in the rear fuselage, making it different from the MD-11F
and MD-11CF models. With only five built, it is believed that all have been retired from service.

MD-11CF ("CF" standing for Convertible Freighter). The MD-11CF came in the early 90's and
offered the "best of both worlds" to customers, providing versatility in being able to operate in
all-passenger or all-freighter configurations. Only six were manufactured, and it looks like
almost all remaining in service have been converted to all-freighter usage.

AMCPAM 24-2, Volume 4, Addendum C will focus primarily on the:

                               QUICK REFERENCE TABLES

2.1. Ranges. Most numbers are shown as a range, due to representing all-passenger to all-freight
versions OR due to different modifications within a series/type. Also, within a series, several
different engines/weight classes may exist.

2.2. Pallets. Unless otherwise noted, pallet information is based on the civilian pallet IATA code
PAG- / P1P- type LD7 which measures 88" × 125".

2.3. Table Legends.
2.3.1. Compartments. Unless otherwise noted, compartments are: M=Main/Upper;
F=Forward/Lower Lobe; A=Aft/Lower Lobe; B=Bulk/Lower Lobe.

2.3.2. “X”. An ―X‖ represents the information does NOT apply for that series/type (ex: an all-
passenger version would have an ―X‖ by Main Compartment Door)

2.3.3. Question Mark “?”. A ―?‖ represents that the information should apply, but no
information exists in the manufacturer’s technical manuals.

2.3.4. Exclamation Point “!”. An ―!‖ represents information that should apply, but has been
derived from a reliable, but non-manufacturer source.

2.4. After-Market Conversions. As a reminder, individual airlines may have converted an
airframe apart from the manufacturer’s original specifications. These tables and the charts in the
following chapters do not account for this.

2.5. Tables. The following tables (Tables 2.1 through 2.6) will vary with each AMCPAM 24-2,
Volume 4 Addendum.

                                              2) Minimum 2 inches of clearance must exist between aircraft contour and maximum payload contour (represented by inner solid line of

                                              3) All horizontal dimensions are measured left or right of aircraft centerline (CL).
                                              4) All vertical dimensions are measured from the top of the conveyor plane.
