1.2. Responsibilities. Fire Prevention is a primary objective of the flight. This objective is
achieved with an aggressive and effective fire prevention program consisting of fire safety
education, inspections, enforcement and facility design review. A secondary objective is early
intervention at emergency events by occupants, operators, and automatic fire
detection/suppression systems. Finally, the third objective is to intervene early with firefighters
when FES events occur. This multi-phased approach ensures mitigating actions are initiated as
soon as possible to minimize consequences of the incident. The most crucial ingredient in an
effective fire prevention program is the commander's involvement and awareness. All personnel,
including contractors and concessionaires when working on Luke Air Force Base, will observe
fire prevention measures. Unit commanders and supervisors are responsible for enforcing this
instruction as it pertains to their respective building, area, and government. Anyone who
deliberately or through negligence sets fire to or causes a fire in such a manner as to endanger the
safety of any person or property will be in violation of this instruction, Federal Laws, and the
Uniform Code of Military Justice. All unit commanders and supervisors will take appropriate
administrative or disciplinary action in cases of willful misconduct or negligence involving fire
prevention requirements. Any fire hazard or condition recognized by using personnel that is not
specifically covered by this instruction will be brought to the attention of the Fire Prevention
Office
1.3. Reporting Fire and/or Smoke. It is the responsibility of all personnel to report all fires to
Luke Fire Emergency Services whether or not the fire can be or has been extinguished without
the aid of the fire department.
   1.3.1. Procedures for reporting a fire:
       1.3.1.1. Immediately warn all building occupants verbally and/or by activating installed
       fire alarm system (manual pull station). Upon hearing a fire alarm, all building occupants
       are required to evacuate to a designated safe location.

     7.1.4.1. All installed grease filters and exposed surfaces of kitchen range hoods must be
     thoroughly cleaned by the operator. This task will be performed daily or as necessary to
     prevent accumulation of grease (Ref. AFOSH Std. 91-501; Chapter 6).
     7.1.4.2. Kitchen range hoods and exhaust ducts must be thoroughly cleaned to prevent
     accumulation of grease. Cleaning includes grease accumulation on fans, roofs, louvers,
     exterior walls, copulas, etc., where the system exhausts to the outside. Specific guidance
     for cleaning is contained in NFPA Standard 96, Ventilation Control and Fire Protection
     of Commercial Cooking Operations. Commanders determine whether in-house resources
     or contract will be used for this purpose.
     7.1.4.3. Cooking is not permitted under a range hood without grease filters installed.

     Fahrenheit and a secondary thermostat that must ensure that the maximum temperature of
     the liquid does not exceed 475 degrees Fahrenheit.
         7.1.4.7.1. The 475 degrees Fahrenheit maximum temperature includes the additional
         rise in temperature (called overshoot temperature) that occurs for several minutes
         after the secondary thermostat de-energizes the unit.
         7.1.4.7.2. Thermostats will be tested annually by the appropriate authorized
         contractor.
         7.1.4.7.3. A label/tag will be affixed to the unit showing the test date. Units
         requiring disassembly or the transfer of hot liquid to conduct the test will be modified
         with a shunt bypass assembly as described in Federal Specifications A-F-695F.
         Modifications to meet these requirements will be accomplished during the next
         annual test. A record of the test date will be recorded on the appliance. (Ref.
         AFOSH Std. 91-501)
     7.1.4.8. Installation of restaurant cooking equipment will be IAW NFPA 96 as modified
     by Uniform Fire Code & UFC 3-600-01.

                                    DORMITORY & TLF

14.1. Responsibilities of Dormitory & Temporary Living Facilities (TLF) Residents: The
occupant is responsible for the fire safe condition of their assigned quarters. They will ensure
that they are familiar with fire reporting and evacuation procedures. Sound fire prevention
practices are necessary to ensure a fire safe condition in quarters is as follows:
   14.1.1. The ignition of grease on stoves has been the major cause of fire on many bases. It
   should be pointed out that most common oils and greases have a flash point of approximately
   500 degrees Fahrenheit and extreme caution should be used when cooking with oils and
   greases. All personnel are reminded that stove top cooking with oils and greases must never
   be left unattended.
   14.1.2. Most clothes dryers are equipped with lint traps that shall be cleaned frequently. If
   allowed to accumulate, lint could overflow into the motor mechanism and cause a fire.
   14.1.3. A fire extinguisher rated for ABC class fires is assigned to each unit. The
   extinguisher should be placed in an easily accessible location and inspected once a month to
   insure seal and pin are in place and the pressure gauge reads in the green.

    FIRE PREVENTION STANDARDS DURING CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE

A6.1. These standards will become a part of applicable contract specifications for work to be
performed on Luke AFB.           These standards apply to all construction, reconstruction,
modification, demolition, rehabilitation, alteration, repairs and maintenance of existing facilities.
They apply to facilities which will be constructed within the military construction program,
minor construction program, operation and maintenance, or non-appropriated funds. Fires
during contract performance must be prevented or controlled. Danger from fire is usually greater
during these operations than after contract completion. Serious fires can occur due to the
accumulation of combustible material or debris and the presence of ignition sources. Basic
safeguards against construction fire hazards must be provided for during project planning. This
standard outlines measures, which, with some preplanning, will prevent or at least minimize
damage if fire occurs.
A6.2. Depending upon the size of the project, either the contractor or an individual appointed by
him will be placed in charge of Fire Prevention. His responsibilities will include assuring the
availability, operation, and location of fire protection equipment, general supervision of
safeguards and location of salamanders or portable heating equipment and establishment and
maintenance of safe cutting and welding operations.
A6.3. Contractor's material and equipment will not be stored in a location or manner, which will
create a fire exposure to facilities adjacent to the project site. Fire hydrants will not be fenced in
on construction sites.
A6.4. FIRE REPORTING. All fires, regardless of size, will be reported to the base fire
department immediately by the most expeditious means. Any persons discovering a fire or
suspected fire will alert the building occupants by whatever means that are available. The fire
department will be notified in the following manner: Base personnel will dial 911. If calling
from the housing area, dial 911. These numbers are to be used only for reporting an actual fire
or other serious emergency conditions. A false alarm of fire is a malicious act and transmitting
such false alarms will be subject to disciplinary action.
A6.5. FIRE EXTINGUISHERS. Portable fire extinguishers will be maintained in a fully
charged and operable condition and kept in their designated places at all times. Extinguishers
that require servicing must be taken to any authorized servicing location.
A6.6. STORED MATERIAL. Stored material and other combustibles will be kept a minimum
of 18 inches from steam pipes, lights, electrical fixtures, radiators, and other sources of heat.
A6.7. DISPOSAL OF COMBUSTIBLE MATERIAL:
   A6.7.1. Combustible waste will be disposed of in self closing metal containers, for example,
   oil, paint, soiled rags, sawdust, wood shavings, etc.
   A6.7.2. All waste receptacles will be made of metal and provided with tops (10 gallon or
   larger). Polyethylene and similar plastic material will not contain a fire and therefore will not
   be used for trash containers or haulers.
   A6.7.3. Supervisors will be especially watchful to ensure that all paint, paint thinner and
   flammable glue containers are completely empty before being disposed of. Chemicals and
50                                                           LUKEAFBI32-2001 4 MAY 2011


  their containers will be disposed of in accordance with established safety procedures outlined
  in OPLAN 705
A6.8. ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS:
  A6.8.1. Alterations and extensions to electrical systems will be made only under the
  supervision of qualified civil engineering personnel. Substitution of large fuses by
  unauthorized personnel and the use of fuse substitutes, such as pennies, copper wires, etc.,
  are strictly prohibited.
  A6.8.2. Electrical hot plates, coffee pots, and other electrical cooking and heating appliances
  will not be utilized without written approval from the Fire Prevention Office.
  A6.8.3. The use of multiple outlet plugs and/or sockets is prohibited.
  A6.8.4. Electrical appliances will not be plugged into any ceiling outlet without the approval
  of civil engineering electricians.
  A6.8.5. Panel boards, fuse boxes, and circuit breaker panels will be kept free of piled
  material so that fire fighters and electricians will have easy access.
  A6.8.6. Electrical outlet cover plates must be made of non-conductive materials.
A6.9. HANDLING OF FLAMMABLE LIQUIDS:
  A6.9.1. Flammable liquids will be stored in approved locations only.
  A6.9.2. Flammable liquids will not be dispensed into, store or transported in, containers
  made of glass, plastic, or polyethylene.
  A6.9.3. Gasoline and other flammable liquids will not be used as cleaning agents.
  A6.9.4. Flammable liquids will not be disposed of in drains or other areas not specifically
  designated for the disposal of such liquids.
A6.10. WELDING AND CUTTING:
  A6.10.1. Where possible, welding and cutting will be accomplished in shops. Any welding
  or cutting operations to be approved outside of shops will be reported to the Base Fire
  Prevention Office prior to starting, so that the job site may be inspected and a AF Form 592
  Welding and Cutting permit issued. When necessary, as determined by the Fire Prevention
  Office representative, a vehicular standby will be provided. Responsible welding and cutting
  supervisors will take the following actions:
     A6.10.1.1. Follow checklist on the attachment with the welding permit.
     A6.10.1.2. Remove combustible material to a safe location.
     A6.10.1.3. Ensure that adequate fire extinguishers are provided and that one person is
     designated to operate the extinguisher in the event of fire.
  A6.10.2. Make a thorough inspection of the area after operations are completed to ensure
  that the area is free of fire hazards caused by the operation.
  A6.10.3. Cutting and welding operations are prohibited in aircraft hangars in which aircraft
  are parked; within 50 feet of any aircraft, fueling operation, or fuel storage site; in any area
  where flammable dust or an explosive atmosphere exists.
LUKEAFBI32-2001 4 MAY 2011                                                                       51


   A6.10.4. Return welding permit to the fire prevention office upon expiration of welding
   permit or completion of work
A6.11. REPAIRING ROOFS WITH OTHER THAN COLD TAR APPLICATIONS. Asphalt
and tar kettles will be located 20 feet from all buildings. Such kettles will not be placed on roofs
or porches and continuous supervision will be provided during their use. Metal covers of
sufficient size to completely smother a fire will be attached to the kettle. Used roofing mops will
be stored outside the building and away from other combustibles.
A6.12. GENERAL RULES:
   A6.12.1. Vehicles will not be parked within 15 feet of any fire hydrant and will not be

A7.1. Monthly Inspection of fire extinguisher as required by AFOSH Std 91-501.
A7.2. Inspection is a "quick check" that an extinguisher is available and will operate. It is
intended to give reasonable assurance that the extinguisher is fully charged and operable. This is
done by seeing that it is in its designated place, that it has not been actuated or tampered with,
and that there is no obvious or physical damage or condition to prevent operation.
   A7.2.1. When an inspection reveals any discrepancy, the 150# Halon Extinguisher will be
   taken to the extinguisher maintenance shop (bldg 450) for repair; all others will require
   contacting an outside agency approved by the Fire Prevention Office.
   A7.2.2. Extinguisher(s) removed from the premises to be recharged or repaired will be
   replaced by equivalent spare extinguisher during the period it is gone.
       A7.2.2.1. Ensure extinguisher is in its designated location and access is not obstructed.
       A7.2.2.2. Are pressure gauge readings in the operable range?
       A7.2.2.3. Are pins in place and properly sealed (not bent)?
       A7.2.2.4. Are operating instructions on the fire extinguisher nameplate legible and face
       outward?
       A7.2.2.5. Are classification symbols located on the extinguisher nameplate? Do they
       identify the fire classification for which the extinguisher is suitable, i.e., A, B, C?
       A7.2.2.6. Is there any obvious physical damage, corrosion, leakage, clogged nozzles, or
       cracked hoses?
       A7.2.2.7. Has the extinguisher serial number been recorded on extinguisher tracking log?
       A7.2.2.8. Has the extinguisher maintenance due date been recorded on extinguisher
       tracking log?
       A7.2.2.9. Has the extinguisher hydrostatic test due date been recorded on extinguisher
       tracking log?
       A7.2.2.10. Does the extinguisher information match with its designated location?
       A7.2.2.11. Has the monthly inspection been documented on the extinguisher tracking
       log?
