      AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY, GOALS AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS

2.1. Unit Commanders and Supervisors. Unit Commanders and supervisors at all levels must
make sure that sound fire prevention procedures are set up and practiced in each activity or
facility under their jurisdiction.
   2.1.1. The Fire Prevention Section of the Base Fire Department will be informed when any
   fire hazard cannot be corrected by unit personnel.
   2.1.2. Inform the Fire Prevention Section if there are any fire extinguishers discharged or
   damaged, or any installed fire protection system which may have been damaged during an
   operation by accident or by contact with material handling equipment. All damaged or
   discharged extinguishers will be brought to the Fire Department for re-servicing by building
   occupants.
   2.1.3. Notify the Fire Prevention Section to give lectures and demonstrations. They should
   be scheduled to get full participation from the section requesting the training.
   2.1.4. All personnel will receive a fire prevention orientation, and sound fire prevention
   practices shall be enforced in each work area.
   2.1.5. Hold fire prevention inspections in facilities, areas, and rooms that are under
   continuous lock and key. During scheduled fire prevention inspections, building managers
   will arrange access to all these places.
   2.1.6. The Fire Prevention Section of the fire department will be supplied a current listing of
   building managers as changes take place within an organization.
   2.1.7. Publish standard publications on fire reporting, personnel evacuation, safeguarding
   classified information and firefighting procedures using portable fire extinguishers.
   Depending on the type of activity, add instructions on such things as emergency removal of
   aircraft from hangers, protection of high value and critical materials and accidents that
   involve fuel handling. Post these publications at such places where they can be seen and brief
   all personnel on what the publication requires of them. Send one copy each of these
   publications to the fire protection Fire Prevention Section for each building under their
   jurisdiction for filing.
   2.1.8. A fire evacuation plan will be posted for each building in an area under their
   jurisdiction that shows that most readily accessible escape routes for personnel to use in case
   of a fire. This plan is not needed when building or area escape routes are so easy for all
   concerned to see. The Fire Prevention Section will assist building managers in developing
   these escape routes.
2.2. Building Managers. Building Managers are responsible to their Unit Commander for the
safe condition of each facility under their jurisdiction. When assigned, they must inform the Fire
Prevention Section at Ext. 1266/1484 and receive a special briefing on their duties and
responsibilities for fire prevention matters. They will carry out at least these duties:
   2.2.1. Check fire extinguishers, fire protection doors, panic hardware, exit & emergency exit
   lights, emergency lights, and Automated External Defibrillator’s (AED) on a monthly basis.
 6                                                               910AWI32-2001 2 APRIL 2012


     Make sure they are all in proper working condition and report any deficiencies to EAST help
     desk at extension 1339.
     2.2.2. When a fire evacuation alarm sounds insure that all personnel leave the building.
     2.2.3. Enforce sound fire prevention practices in and outside of the assigned buildings and
     areas.
     2.2.4. Call the Fire Prevention Section, at extension 1266/1484 if any fire hazard cannot be
     corrected on the spot.
     2.2.5. Make a closing inspection at the end of each work day to make sure that the area is
     left in a fire safe condition.
     2.2.6. When a fire lane or fire hydrant is blocked by a vehicle or other obstructions, call
     Security Police.
     2.2.7. During scheduled fire inspections the building manager or an alternate will
     accompany the fire inspector during the inspection tour.
2.3. Goals and Principles of Fire Prevention. The goal of fire prevention is two-fold, first to
eliminate the cause of fire and second, to minimize the possibility of high fire loss should a fire
occur. This can only be done by the continued efforts of personnel in reducing unsafe practices,
conditions and fire hazards. Unit commanders and supervisors must stress and enforce safe
practices, and place a high priority to fund projects which will eliminate construction fire
deficiencies.
     2.3.1. There are four basic principles which must be seen if the Fire Prevention Program is to
     be a meaningful effort. They are:
        2.3.1.1. Effective Fire Prevention must have a ―Well Planned Program‖.
        2.3.1.2. The Fire Chief ―Manages the Program‖.
        2.3.1.3. Commanders ―Enforce The Program‖.
        2.3.1.4. Base and Contractor Personnel ―Execute the Program‖.
2.4. Prohibited Activities and Disciplinary Requirements. Following activities are prohibited

     2.4.5. The willful misconduct (turning in a false fire alarm, tampering with fire detection
     and/or fire suppression systems or devices.

   their inspection tour.
   2.5.2. When the inspection is completed, the Building Manager will be informed of fire

   submitted and proper corrective action will be taken.
   2.5.3. Building Managers will start actions to abate the Hazard/Deficiency, by submitting an
   AF Form 332, "Base Civil Engineer Work Request" (Attachment 3) and send the AF Form
   1487 (Attachment 2a and 2b) back to the Fire Prevention Section, by the suspense date with
   the corrective actions taken noted.
   2.5.4. Set up a Hazard Abatement Plan on an AF Form 3, "U.S. Air Force Hazard Abatement
   Log" (Attachment 4) for all "Risk Assessment Codes" (RAC 1, 2 or 3) hazards/deficiencies
   that have not been abated within 30 calendar days of being reported. Post an AF Form 1118,
   ''Notice of Hazard" (Attachment 5) and send a copy of the plan to the Fire Prevention Office
   and the Safety Office. The functional manager will keep a record of lesser RAC 4, 5 and 6
   hazards/deficiencies.
   2.5.5. All AF Form 1487 (Attachment 2a and 2b) will be sent through command channels

       time as determined by the Base Fire Inspector(s).
       2.5.5.6. If a dangerous practice is observed during an inspection, the fire inspector will
       first request that the operation cease, then he or she will report the findings to the Base
       Fire Chief. The Base Fire Chief will then decide if the operation can continue.
   2.5.6. Walk-through inspections will be done on a "No Notice" basis by the Fire Inspectors,

REPORTING, EQUIPMENT, TRAFFIC CONTROL, SECURITY, PUBLIC ASSEMBLY

3.1. Fire Reporting Procedures. Quick and accurate reporting of a fire is essential to minimize
the response time of fire vehicles. A person who discovers a fire, no matter how small, must
report it at once to the fire department. Any fire, even if it was put out with no aid from the fire
department must be reported.
   3.1.1. A person discovering a fire will take the following actions:
       3.1.1.1. Sound the alarm by activating the building fire alarm (manual pull station); use
       the Public Address System; or any other means available to alert occupants of the
       building or facility.
       3.1.1.2. Call the Fire Department by dialing 911 (base phone) or 330-609-1117 (cell
       phone).
   3.1.2. When the Fire Department Dispatcher comes on the line be as calm as possible and
   give the following information:
       3.1.2.1. The building number and name of the facility or area involved.
       3.1.2.2. The room number and/or section name if the area involved.
       3.1.2.3. What is on fire or if only smoke or odor is present describe the smoke or odor.
       3.1.2.4. Your full name and a phone number where you can be contacted at.

   330-609-1117 (cell phone). NOTE: By dialing/using ―911‖ from an on-base phone, the call
   goes directly to the base fire department alarm room. Do not try to contact the base Fire
   Department from a cell phone or from off-base, as the call will then go to the Trumbull

   the base Fire Department. This could create a substantial critical time loss in any given
   emergency.
   6.1.2. The person needing medical treatment shall. The person needing medical
   treatment shall remain at the location they got injured at until emergency crews can get to
   them. Under no circumstances shall an injured person be transported to the fire station.

   required paperwork on the injury.
