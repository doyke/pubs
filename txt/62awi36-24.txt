This instruction outlines general and specific procedures to be followed by 62d Airlift Wing (62 AW)
units in the nomination of personnel for STEP promotion consideration. This instruction is applicable to
all squadron and staff agencies assigned to the 62 AW.



1. General.
   1.1. Each year, the 62 AW commander (62 AW/CC) is given quotas to promote a specified number of
   airmen to the grades of SSgt through MSgt. Quotas originate at HQ AFPC and are provided to the
   major commands and separate operating agencies who, in turn, allocate quotas to their subordinate
   units. The 62 AW/CC will receive quotas through this process. This instruction outlines the proce-
   dures to be used to select the individuals who will be submitted to the 62 AW/CC for promotion con-
   sideration.
   1.2. Individuals nominated for promotion consideration will be screened by a 62 AW central selection
   board. The central board will consist of two colonels and three chief master sergeants representing all
   groups and the Director of Staff, including the 62 AW Senior Enlisted Advisor (62 AW/CCC). Board
   members will be appointed by the 62 AW/CC with recommendations from the 62 AW/CCC.

2. Responsibilities.
   2.1. The 62 AW/CC will brief the board to set guidelines for evaluating nominees.
   2.2. The central board members will review the records of all nominees and score records on a scale
   of 1 to 10 in half point increments. A sample score sheet is at Attachment 1. The 62 AW/CCC will
   score all records, however, his/her scores will only be used as a tie breaker. Differences of 3 points or
   more between board members will be discussed by the board with the chairperson facilitating a reso-
   lution. The board’s recommendation will be forwarded to the 62 AW/CC and will remain confidential
   until approved and released by the 62 AW/CC.

3. Content . Primary non-selectees will be forwarded to 15th Air Force for STEP consideration at that
level. Primary non-selects are those nominees receiving the next highest scores after those individuals
promoted by the 62 AW/CC.
    3.1. Nomination packages will be due to the 62 AW/CCC by the second Thursday of November. The
    central board will meet the third week of November.
    3.2. Each 62 AW group and the Wing Director of Staff may submit two individuals per category to
    the Central board. The categories are promotion to SSgt, TSgt and MSgt. For the purpose of this
    instruction, Wing Staff includes:
       3.2.1. Wing headquarters administrative staff
       3.2.2. Protocol
       3.2.3. Wing IG (Exercise Evaluation)
       3.2.4. Air Museum

       3.2.14. Social Actions
       3.2.15. Staff Judge Advocate
    3.3. Each individual nomination package will include a promotion RIP, the individual's last five EPRs
    (or all EPRs if the individual has less than five), a personal data page, and a one-page cover letter
    signed by the squadron commander. The commander’s letter should consist of a chronological sum-
    mary, in narrative format, of the individual’s achievements not already included in the EPRs and/or
    additional details or clarifications of items in the EPRs. Attachment 2 and Attachment 3 are exam-
    ples of the personal data page and commander’s cover letter.

MEMORANDUM TO 62 AW/CC
FROM: GROUP/CC (OR 62 AW/DS)
SUBJECT: STEP Promotion for SrA Janette Q. Airman


SrA Janette Q. Airman unquestionably deserves a STEP promotion to the grade of Staff Sergeant. She has
garnered accolades at the squadron, group, and wing level, as well as from TDY units. Her achievements
and honors stretch throughout her military career and will undoubtedly continue into her future. She has
been at McChord since May 97 and has garnered such awards as Wing airman of the Quarter and the Air-
man Leaderships School’s John L. Levitow Award. She is the mobility and SORTS monitor for the
weather flight, duties that are normally reserved for a SSgt or TSgt. She volunteers many hours of her
off-duty time to help others and has been awarded the “Military Outstanding Volunteer Services Award”
by the local Red Cross chapter. (chronological narrative) I could not be prouder of her accomplishments
and feel very fortunate to have someone of her caliber in my group. I can think of no one who better
exhibits the essence of a truly professional member of our enlisted corps than SrA Airman. A STEP pro-
motion would be just reward for the great things she has done and will continue to do for the wing.

Commander, 62d Operations Group
