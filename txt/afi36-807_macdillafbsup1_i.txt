This instruction implements AFPD 36-8, Employee Benefits and Entitlements, by providing guidance and
procedures supervisors need to schedule civilian employees (except non-US citizen employees employed
outside the United States and the District of Columbia) for work and holiday observances. It tells how to
establish work schedules, rest and lunch periods, make ready and clean-up time. It describes work subject
to premium pay and shows how to get approval for holiday work.

(MACDILL) AFI 36-807, 21 June 1999, is supplemented as follows. This supplement provides addi-
tional guidance and procedures that supervisors need to schedule civilian employees for work and holiday
observances.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision incorporates IC 99-1 and adds the definition of alternative workplace arrangement (AWA)
as paragraph 2.3., (re-numbering the remaining terms and definitions in paragraph 2.), and authorizes
MAJCOMs, FOAs or DRUs to establish alternative workplace arrangement (AWA) programs. MAJ-
COMs, FOAs or DRUs may delegate this authority to installation commanders (para 3.3.). Organization
and tenant commanders establish by written order the daily hours for beginning and ending work and the
basic 40-hour tour of duty, including uncommon tours of duty, alternative work schedules (AWS), hours
and location(s) for alternative workplace arrangements (AWA), as well as rest and lunch periods for their
respective organizations (para 3.2.). IC 99-1 assigns numbers to material in paragraphs 4.2., 4.3., and 4.4.
which had previously been listed with bullets, and adds Attachment 2, with information and a sample
AWA agreement for supervisors and employees. Changed or revised material is indicated by a bar (|).
The entire text of IC 99-1 is at Attachment 3.

1. Scope of Applicability. This instruction applies Air Force-wide, to appropriated fund civilian employ-
ees, including US Air Force Reserve (USAFR) and Air National Guard Title 5, United States Code.

2. Terms and Definitions. The following terms and definitions are used in this instruction.
   2.1. Administrative Workweek. The Air Force administrative workweek begins at 0001 Sunday and
   ends at 2400 on the next following Saturday. The calendar day on which a shift begins is considered
   the day of duty for that day even though the day of duty extends into the next calendar day or into the
   following administrative workweek.
   2.2. Alternative Work Schedules (AWS). Work schedules made up of flexible or compressed sched-
   ules.
   2.3. Alternative Workplace Arrangements (AWA). Working under a flexiplace arrangement, either at
   home or other approved location(s), such as a telecommuting center (See Attachment 2 for a sample
   agreement).
   2.4. Basic Workweek. The days and hours of an administrative workweek which make up a full-time
   employee's regularly scheduled 40-hour workweek.
   2.5. Compressed Schedule. Compressed schedule means for a full-time employee, an 80-hour
   biweekly basic work requirement which is scheduled in less than 10 workdays. In the case of a
   part-time employee, it is a biweekly basic work requirement of less than 80 hours which is scheduled
   for less than 10 workdays.
   2.6. First 40-Hours. The first 40 hours of duty performed within a period of no more than six days of
   the administrative workweek may be established as the basic workweek when it is impractical to pre-
   scribe a regular schedule of definite hours of duty each workday.
   2.7. Flexible Schedule. Flexible schedule is that portion of the work day during which the employee
   has the option to select and vary starting and stopping times within established limits set by installa-
   tion level approving officials for AWS.
   2.8. Holiday Work. Work performed on a legal holiday or the day observed as a holiday.
   2.9. Observed Day. Observed day is a holiday in which employees are given time off on a day other
   than the date which the holiday actually falls on.
   2.10. Part Time. In some circumstances it is not possible to obtain or use an employee's services for
   the full 40-hour workweek. Part time tours of duty may be authorized when service on a regular,
   repetitive basis is required at least one day during each administrative workweek, however, additional
   service may be required during the remainder of the administrative workweek.
   2.11. Regular Tour of Duty. The regular tour of duty for Air Force employees is five 8-hour days,
   Monday through Friday.
   2.12. Special Tour of Duty for Educational Purposes. A special tour of duty of no less than 40 hours
   in an administrative workweek which may be established by supervisors to permit employees to take
   courses at nearby educational institutions.
   2.13. Standby. Certain types of work require employees to remain at their duty stations for long peri-
   ods of duty, a substantial part of which is standby time. For example, the tour of duty for firefighters
   generally is a 72-hour workweek of three 24-hour days. The tour is scheduled so that the employee is
4                                                AFI36-807_MACDILLAFBSUP1_I 10 MARCH 2004


    on duty three alternate 24-hour shifts during each administrative workweek, and deviations from this
    tour are kept to a minimum. The basic weekly tour of duty for fire chiefs, assistant fire chiefs, fire pre-
    vention inspectors, and similar fire protection personnel is 40-hour workweek of five 8-hour days
    unless the duties of the position require substantial amounts of standby time.
    2.14. Uncommon Tour of Duty. Any 40-hour basic workweek scheduled to include Saturday and or
    Sunday, for four workdays or less but not more than six days of the administrative workweek. An
    uncommon tour of duty may be established when necessary for efficient operations or when the cost
    of operations can thus be reduced without imposing undue hardship on employees.
    2.15. (Added-MACDILL) Irregular Tour of Duty. Any tour that deviates for the Commander’s nor-
    mal tour of duty and which does not include Saturday and/or Sunday.

3. Basic Authority:
    3.1. Installation Commanders. Installation Commanders establish the hours for opening and closing
    the installation.
       3.1.1. (Added-MACDILL) The Regular Tour of Duty will consist of five 8-hour days, Monday
       through Friday. The hours of operation for elements of this command are 0730 to 1630, with one
       hour for lunch.
    3.2. Organization and Tenant Commanders. Organization and tenant commanders establish by writ-
    ten order the daily hours for beginning and ending work and the basic 40-hour tour of duty including
    uncommon tours of duty, alternative work schedules (AWS), hours and location(s) for alternative
    workplace arrangements (AWA), as well as rest and lunch periods for their respective organizations.
    Organization and tenant commanders or their designated representative should set work schedules,
    assign overtime and holiday work to balance mission requirements, efficiency and economy of opera-
    tions, and employee needs. These determinations are subject to approval by the installation com-
    mander or his or her designated representative who has authority for operation of base facilities.
    NOTE: organization/tenant commanders set the hours and locations for AWS and AWA; MAJCOMs/
    FOAs/DRUs approve AWS and AWA programs, unless they delegate this authority to installation
    commanders as provided in 3.3.
    3.2. (MACDILL) Authority for approval of changes to the regular tour of duty is delegated to organi-
    zation and tenant commanders to establish uncommon tours, irregular tours, and lunch periods.
       3.2.1. Organization and tenant commanders may also establish regularly scheduled tours of duty
       of more than 40 hours within the administrative workweek when such action is essential to mis-
       sion accomplishment, and when other administrative action such as changes in authorized staffing
       or detail of personnel is neither feasible or desirable. Except under extraordinary circumstances, a
       tour of duty which includes regular overtime should not extend beyond 48 hours in an administra-
       tive workweek. Organization and tenant commanders may extend the regularly scheduled admin-
       istrative workweek to any length exceeding 40 hours when emergency conditions exist and it is
       necessary for mission accomplishment. The extension of the tour of duty will be subject to the
       requirements of applicable laws and regulations.
       3.2.2. (Added-MACDILL) Union notification for tours of duty deviating from the regular tour of
       duty for employees covered by a memorandum of agreement must be coordinated with the Civil-
       ian Personnel Flight prior to implementation in accordance with the provisions contained in the
       applicable memorandum of agreement.
AFI36-807_MACDILLAFBSUP1_I 10 MARCH 2004                                                               5


   3.3. Major Commands, Field Operating Activities and Direct Reporting Units. Major Commands
   (MAJCOM), field operating activities (FOA) and Direct Reporting Units (DRU) are authorized to
   approve AWS and AWA programs. MAJCOMs, FOAs or DRUs may delegate this authority to instal-
   lation commanders
   3.4. Supervisors. Supervisors will generally schedule employee's work on the same hours each day,
   and breaks in excess of one hour during a day will not be permitted. Supervisors must give a mini-
   mum of one week's notice to employees when they are to be assigned to a different tour of duty or to
   different hours of duty except as provided under AWS or for educational purposes.
       3.4.1. Commanders may grant an exception to this requirement when circumstances preclude
       compliance, for example, when a change in shifts by a contractor requires immediate correspond-
       ing change in the tour of inspectors, or when normal operations are interrupted by events beyond
       the control of management, such as, fire, flood, breakdown of equipment. Commanders assure
       that changes in established work schedules are kept to a minimum and made only when necessary
       to resolve operational problems.

4. Tours of Duty:
   4.1. Tours of Duty for Educational Purposes. Supervisors may establish special tours of duty for edu-
   cational purposes.
       4.1.1. Employees who are on special tours of duty for educational purposes cannot be paid pre-
       mium pay solely because the rescheduling of his or her tour of duty causes him or her to work on
       a day, or during the hours of a day, when premium pay would otherwise be required.
       4.1.2. Supervisors are not prohibited from assigning an employee to a regularly scheduled shift
       requiring premium pay, for example, night pay, since no additional costs are incurred. Supervisors
       must notify the civilian payroll office when an employee is assigned to or changed from a special
       tour of duty to prevent inadvertent payment of premium pay. Supervisors must maintain a record
       of these tours of duty for the purpose of responding to Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
       inquiries.
   4.2. Posting Work Schedules. Supervisors must post copies of work schedules for all tours of duty,
   except regular Monday through Friday tours, which include the names of assigned employees in the
   work area. Supervisors must maintain a copy of employee's work schedules in their operating office.
   Supervisors:
       4.2.1. Post a written statement of actual work requirements for standby tours of duty.
       4.2.2. Give employees with regularly scheduled 60 or 72 hour standby tours of duty 30 calendar
       days notice of any reduction in the percentage of premium pay resulting from a change in work
       requirements.
       4.2.3. Give employees with regularly scheduled 40-hour tours of duty plus scheduled standby
       time as much notice as possible when changing their duty schedule.
       4.2.4. Review work requirements periodically for changes which may affect the payment of pre-
       mium compensation and revise work schedules where necessary.
   4.3. Scheduling Rest Periods. Supervisors may schedule short rest periods, not exceeding 15 minutes
   during each four hours of continuous work, when the supervisor believes the rest periods will be of
6                                               AFI36-807_MACDILLAFBSUP1_I 10 MARCH 2004


    benefit to the service. (NOTE: Supervisors must adhere to applicable labor management agreements
    if they contain provisions for the granting of rest periods.)
       4.3.1. Criteria to be followed by supervisors in determining the justification for granting rest peri-
       ods are:
           4.3.1.1. Protection of employee's health by relieving them from hazardous work or very phys-
           ical work.
           4.3.1.2. Reduce the accident rate by removing the fatigue potential.
           4.3.1.3. Relieve those who work in confined spaces.
           4.3.1.4. Increasing or maintaining a high quality or quantity production.
    4.4. Scheduling Lunch Periods. When supervisors schedule lunch (or other meal) periods, during
    which the employee is entirely free of the duties of his or her position, the period is not considered as
    duty time for which compensation is paid.
       4.4.1. Supervisors will generally schedule time for lunch apart from the hours of duty when one
       or two shifts are in operation.
       4.4.2. When supervisors schedule more than one 8-hour shift in a 24-hour period and an overlap-
       ping of shifts to permit time off for lunch is not possible, supervisors may authorize an on-the-job
       lunch period of 20 minutes or less. On-the-job lunch periods require that:
           4.4.2.1. Employees spend their on-the-job lunch at or near their work stations. Under these
           conditions, the time covered by the 20 minute on-the-job lunch period is compensable.
           4.4.2.2. Employees given duty free lunch periods during periods of overtime work will not
           receive compensation for that time.
    4.5. Scheduling Make Ready and Clean-Up Time. Incidental duties that are directly connected with
    the performance of a job, such as obtaining and replacing working tools or materials, undergoing
    inspections, and similar tasks are considered part of the job requirements within the employee's estab-
    lished tour of duty. Supervisors must arrange work shifts so that time required for incidental duties
    will be part of the 8-hour day.
       4.5.1. When incidental duties cannot be part of the regularly scheduled workday, the extra time
       for which overtime may be paid to an employee, will not exceed 30 minutes a day.
    4.6. (Added-MACDILL) Flextime.
       4.6.1. (Added-MACDILL) 6th Air Mobility Wing organization commanders have the authority to
       approve/disapprove the use of flextime by non bargaining unit employees in their organization.
       Bargaining unit employees are covered by the applicable memorandum of agreement. Use of flex-
       time is encouraged since it is known to increase job productivity, service to the public, and
       increase job satisfaction among employees. If flextime is disapproved, the employee/union will be
       forwarded a written copy of the supervisor’s objective determination and the criteria used to arrive
       at his/her decision. Flextime will not be approved/disapproved indiscriminately or be used to
       reward or punish an employee. Mission Partners may choose to use/develop a flextime program,
       as deemed appropriate by the commander for non bargaining unit employees.

          keeping manual. The word “Flextime” is written in red across the “Normal Duty Hours” space
          of the time sheet. The employee will record daily the appropriate information on MacDill IMT
          42, Sign in/Sign out Log – Flextime Record. The timekeeper will transfer this information to
          the Time and Attendance sheet. The location of MacDill IMT 42 will be at the discretion of the
          supervisor.
          4.6.3.3. (Added-MACDILL) Absences, Tardiness, or Early Departures. For tardiness and
          leave purposes, the first hour of the workday commences at the individual’s scheduled arrival
          time for that day. Supervisors have authority in case of tardiness, short term absences, and
          early departure to (1) charge period of time to an approved leave category; (2) charge absent
          without leave; or (3) extend the individual’s scheduled workday (not beyond 1800 hours) to
          compensate for tardiness. Flextime will be terminated for the involved pay periods if an
          employee is away on temporary duty for training and other purposes.
          4.6.3.4. (Added-MACDILL) Employees must be productively engaged in work assignments
          even though a supervisor may not be present.
       4.6.4. (Added-MACDILL) Supervisors will approve or disapprove individual requests for flex-
       time within the guidelines established herein or in the appropriate memorandum of agreement, and
       will ensure that employees on flextime work or otherwise account for an eight hour day plus lunch
       break.
       4.6.5. (Added-MACDILL) Schedules, in approved flextime request, will be adhered to by super-
       visors and employees subject to supervening unit mission exigencies and such leave as may be
       approved in accordance with existing directives.
       4.6.6. (Added-MACDILL) Supervisors are responsible for certifying the correctness of the Time
       and Attendance sheet.
       4.6.7. (Added-MACDILL) Supervisors may deny an employee request for continuation on flex-
       time if documented substantiation of the employee having abused the flextime privilege exists in
       the supervisor’s work folder. The employee may also be subject to disciplinary action.
       4.6.8. (Added-MACDILL) Security measures as prescribed by existing regulations will be main-
       tained.
       4.6.9. (Added-MACDILL) New employees may not be permitted to work flextime for the first 90

       Also, employees whose performance begins to fall below fully successful during the rating period
       may also be subject to the above provisions.
       4.6.10. (Added-MACDILL) Schedules will be discontinued if flextime has resulted or is likely to
       result in adverse impact. Adverse impact is defined as a reduction of the productivity, a diminished
       level of services provided to the public, or an increase in the cost of operations other than a reason-
       able administrative cost relating to the process of establishing flextime or compressed schedules.

        4.7.4. (Added-MACDILL) Morning Arrival Time. An employee may choose to begin work
        between 0600 and 0730 and may depart between 1530 and 1830. For those employees whose duty
        day begins prior to 0600, the arrival and departure time will be adjusted accordingly to fulfill the
        9/10 hours per day requirement. A non-compensable lunch break of at least 30 minutes and not to
        exceed 1 hour is required. This time will be added to the workday not to exceed 11 hours.
        4.7.5. (Added-MACDILL) Off Day. An employee may choose to take either Monday or Friday of
        either week as the off day, subject to approval of the supervisor. In case of conflict between two or
        more employees choosing the same day off, the employee with the earlier date of participation in
        the program will have preference. Where two or more employees have chosen to participate in the
        program on the same date and there is a conflict concerning the desired off day, service computa-
        tion date, i.e., seniority will resolve the conflict.
        4.7.6. (Added-MACDILL) Work Schedule. An employee participating in the CWS will submit

        likely to result in adverse impact. Adverse impact is defined as a reduction of productivity, a
        diminished level of services provided to the public, or an increase in the cost of operations other
        than a reasonable administrative cost relating to the process establishing CWS.

5. Holiday Observances:
     5.1. Holiday Duty. Supervisors must not require employees to work on holidays or days designated
     as observed days, unless the work is justified by unusual circumstances or if the maintenance of usual
     essential services is involved.
        5.1.1. Supervisors will order holiday work when required and have it approved in writing by an
        official designated to authorize holiday work. Supervisors must obtain this approval before work
        is performed, except in cases of an emergency, because it constitutes authority for expenditure of
        funds and certification that funds are available to pay the employee. Supervisors ordering work on
        a holiday or employees required to remain on duty during an emergency will not require advance
        approval for the work. Supervisors must record the reasons for the holiday and the hours worked
        by the employees no later than the following workday. This requirement does not apply to tours
        of duty regularly scheduled on a holiday or observed day for employees engaged in essential ser-
        vices such as firefighters, police, hospital employees, or other service personnel. The supervisor
        will record holiday work on an AF Form 428, Request for Overtime, Holiday Premium Pay, and
        Compensatory Time.
     5.2. Observed Day. When a holiday falls on a regularly scheduled workday, observe that day as the
     holiday. If a holiday falls on Sunday and the employee has a regularly scheduled 40-hour basic work-
AFI36-807_MACDILLAFBSUP1_I 10 MARCH 2004                                                               11


  week of Monday through Friday, the employee will observe the following Monday as the holiday.
  When the holiday falls on Saturday, the employee will observe the holiday on the proceeding Friday.
     5.2.1. When a holiday falls on a Sunday and that Sunday is a nonworkday for employees with a
     regularly scheduled 40-hour basic workweek of other than Monday through Friday, observe the
     next regularly scheduled workday as the holiday.
         5.2.1.1. When a holiday falls on the nonworkday designated as the day in-lieu-of Sunday,
         observe the next regularly scheduled workday as a holiday. When a holiday or a designated
         observed day falls on an employee's nonworkday (Monday through Saturday), the workday
         immediately preceding the day is observed as the holiday.
     5.2.2. Deleted
  5.3. Deleted
  5.4. When full-time employees on a compressed work schedule are relieved or prevented from work-
  ing on a day designated as a holiday, they are entitled to basic pay for the number of hours of the com-
  pressed work schedule on that day.
  5.5. Holiday observances for employees who work a flexible schedule are the same as those for
  full-time employees with a regularly scheduled 40-hour basic workweek.
  5.6. When a holiday falls on a part-time employee's regularly scheduled workday, the employee is
  entitled to be excused with pay for the number of hours he or she is scheduled to work on the actual
  day of the holiday.
     5.6.1. If full-time employees observe an "in-lieu-of" day instead of the actual holiday and that
     "in-lieu-of" day falls within a part-time employee's work schedule, the part-time employee will
     not get that day off with pay.
     5.6.2. When a holiday is observed by full-time employees on a day within the part-time
     employee's regularly scheduled workweek and the part-time employee is prevented from working
     that day, the employee is entitled to be excused with pay for the number of hours he or she is
     scheduled to work on that day.
     5.6.3. When a holiday falls on a part-time employee's nonworkday and is observed by full-time
     employees that day, the employee is not entitled to the holiday.
     5.6.4. When a part-time employee is on a flexible schedule and is relieved or prevented from
     working on a day designated as a holiday by a Federal statute or Executive Order (E.O.), the
     employee is entitled to receive basic pay for the number of hours the employee would have
     worked on that holiday up to eight hours.
     5.6.5. When a holiday falls on a nonworkday, the employee is not entitled to an "in-lieu of" day
     for that holiday.
     5.6.6. When a part-time employee is on a compressed work schedule and is relieved or prevented
     from working on a day within the employee's scheduled tour of duty that is designated as a holiday
     by Federal statute or E.O., the employee is entitled to basic pay for the number of hours of the
     compressed work schedule on that day.
     5.6.7. When a part-time employee is on a compressed work schedule and a holiday falls on a non-
     workday, the employee is not entitled to an "in-lieu-of" day for that holiday.

     5.7. Duration of Holiday. The full 24-hours of a calendar day are normally considered as the duration
     of a holiday. However, when an employee's regular workday begins on a holiday and extends into the
     next calendar day, the entire shift is considered as a holiday to determine the employee's entitlement to
     holiday premium pay or time off for observance of the holiday. If an employee's regularly scheduled
     tour of duty includes two shifts beginning on a holiday, the first shift is considered as a holiday to
     determine holiday benefits.

                     ALTERNATIVE WORKPLACE ARRANGEMENTS (AWA)

A2.1. REASONS FOR AWA. Employers offer alternative workplace arrangements for many reasons.
Such arrangements may:
     A2.1.1. Improve the quality of work life and job performance and increases productivity, e.g., reduce
     office overcrowding and provide a distraction-free environment for reading, analyzing and writing;
     A2.1.2. Improve morale and reduces stress by giving employees more options to balance work and
     family demands;
     A2.1.3. Increase customer access to needed services;
     A2.1.4. Provide services when the regular office is closed;
     A2.1.5. Extend employment opportunities to people with disabilities, including employees who have
     partially recovered from work-related injuries who can do the job from an off-site location;
     A2.1.6. Accommodate employees who have temporary or continuing health problems or who might
     otherwise have to retire on disability;
     A2.1.7. Potentially enhance recruitment and promote diversity by expanding the geographic recruit-
     ment pool; and
     A2.1.8. Decrease traffic and parking congestion, energy consumption and air pollution.

A2.2. Organizations planning to use AWA should address issues such as the following: work assign-
ment/performance requirements, time and attendance, work schedule and tour of duty, duty station, leave,
equipment/supplies, labor relations issues, and other related work arrangement requirements.

A2.3. Sample Agreement Between Organization, Supervisor, And Employee Approved For An
Alternative Workplace Arrangement On A Continuing Basis:
The supervisor and employee should each keep a copy of the agreement for reference.

                                            TEXT OF IC 99-1
SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision incorporates IC 99-1 and adds the definition of alternative workplace arrangement (AWA)
as paragraph 2.3., (re-numbering the remaining terms and definitions in paragraph 2..), and authorizes
MAJCOMs, FOAs or DRUs to establish alternative workplace arrangement (AWA) programs. MAJ-
COMs, FOAs or DRUs may delegate this authority to installation commanders (para 3.3.). Organization
and tenant commanders establish by written order the daily hours for beginning and ending work and the
basic 40-hour tour of duty, including uncommon tours of duty, alternative work schedules (AWS), hours
and location(s) for alternative workplace arrangements (AWA), as well as rest and lunch periods for their
respective organizations (para 3.2.). IC 99-1 assigns numbers to material in paragraphs 4.2., 4.3., and 4.4.
which had previously been listed with bullets, and adds Attachment 2, with information and a sample
AWA agreement for supervisors and employees. Changed or revised material is indicated by a bar (|).
The entire text of IC 99-1 is at Attachment 3.
2.3. Alternative Workplace Arrangements (AWA). Working under a flexiplace arrangement, either at
home or other approved location(s), such as a telecommuting center (See Attachment 2 for a sample
agreement).
3.2. Organization and Tenant Commanders. Organization and tenant commanders establish by written
order the daily hours for beginning and ending work and the basic 40-hour tour of duty including uncom-
mon tours of duty, alternative work schedules (AWS), hours and location(s) for alternative workplace
arrangements (AWA), as well as rest and lunch periods for their respective organizations. Organization
and tenant commanders or their designated representative should set work schedules, assign overtime and

office overcrowding and provide a distraction-free environment for reading, analyzing and writing;
A2.1.2. Improve morale and reduces stress by giving employees more options to balance work and fam-
ily demands;
A2.1.3. Increase customer access to needed services;

A2.1.4. Provide services when the regular office is closed;
A2.1.5. Extend employment opportunities to people with disabilities, including employees who have par-
tially recovered from work-related injuries who can do the job from an off-site location;

erwise have to retire on disability;
A2.1.7. Potentially enhance recruitment and promote diversity by expanding the geographic recruitment
pool; and
