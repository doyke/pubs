            guide, a multifunctional team comprised of government and contractor
            personnel shall be responsible for defining the requirement and developing all
            appropriate documentation/attachments (e.g. Performance-Based Work
            Statement (PBWS), work specification, quality assurance criteria, data
            requirements, reports, etc.) for inclusion in the task-specific “ordering”
            document (e.g. Implementation Agreement, Specific Workload Agreement,
            Direct Sales Order, etc.). Prior to issuance, every “ordering” document shall
            be coordinated and signed by the private sector partner and coordinated
            through MXW and the appropriate production division, then approved by
            MXW. The Contracting Officer assigned to MXW may sign the “ordering”
            document upon MXW approval.

Document—Any paper or electronic media used to contain or store information such as, but not
limited to: policies, procedures, drawings technical orders, process orders, work control
documents, work instructions, etc. as evidence of a documented quality system.
Inspection—An activity such as measuring, examining, testing, or gauging one or more
characteristics of an entity and comparing the results with specified requirements in order to
establish whether conformity is achieved for each measurable characteristic.
Instructions—Provide essential procedural guidance to implement Air Force policy in the field.
Instructions direct action, ensure compliance, or provide detailed procedures for standard actions
across the Air Force.
ISO Standards—The International Organization for Standardization’s documented agreements
containing technical specifications or other precise criteria to be used consistently as rules,
guidelines, or definitions of characteristics, to ensure that materials, products, processes, and
services are fit for their purpose.

Process—A set of inter-related resources and activities which transform inputs into outputs.
Product—The result of activities or processes. A product may include service, hardware,
processed materials, software, or a combination thereof.
Quality Management System—The QMS is a web of interconnected processes. Each process
uses resources to turn inputs into outputs. All of these processes are interconnected by means of
many input-output relationships. Every process generates at least one output, and this output
becomes an input for another process. These input-output relationships glue all of these
processes together and make them into a system.
