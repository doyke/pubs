This supplement to AFI 11-218, 11 May 2005, applies to all personnel assigned to the 27th Fighter Wing
and establishes policies and procedures for training and certifying selected technicians to perform F-16
aircraft engine runs conducted on the parking ramp, trim pad, boresight pad and in the Hush House.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
Removed all reference to the 6-month emergency procedure test.
1.4.3.1. (Added) Personnel requirements and responsibilities for F-16 aircraft maintenance runs:
1.4.3.1.1. (Added) Aircraft engine operator who is certified to perform engine operation.
1.4.3.1.2. (Added) Ground observer will be in contact with (by intercom) and in full view of the engine
operator at all times during engine operation. Ground observer cannot be involved in maintenance.
1.4.3.1.3. (Added) A trained fire guard with an appropriate fire extinguisher will be in the required posi-
tion prior to and during engine start and shutdown or when required by applicable technical orders (TOs).
1.4.3.1.4. (Added) An additional person is required if operational or component leak checks or other
maintenance is to be performed during the engine start or shutdown.
1.4.3.1.5. (Added) Quiet hours are between 2230 and 0600 local. During these hours, F-16s may be run
unsuppressed at idle. However, if an engine run is required above idle, the engine run must be conducted
in the Hush House. If flying operations continue into quiet hours, the squadrons have 30 minutes after the
last landing time to conduct normal engine runs unsuppressed above idle. Any deviation from these
instructions will be coordinated with the POC, 27 AMXS/CM or 27 AMXS/CEM.
1.4.3.1.6. (Added) Engine motoring procedures will be treated with the same safety considerations and
procedures as an installed engine run.

1.4.3.1.6.1. (Added) Personnel performing intake and exhaust inspections will remove and safeguard all
items from their pockets (ie. pens, pencils, coins, keys, billfold, etc) prior to putting on the pocketless cov-
eralls.
1.4.3.1.6.2. (Added) Engine run personnel will remove and safeguard all items from their pockets prior to
entering the cockpit.
1.4.3.1.7. (Added) Inspection of intake and exhaust. Inspection for foreign object damage (FOD) in the
engine intake, exhaust and areas forward of the intake will be accomplished prior to and immediately after
aircraft engine run or motoring, including a post-flight inspection. All aircraft intake and exhaust inspec-
tions will be documented in the AFTO Forms 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document, on a
Red “X.”
1.4.3.1.8. (Added) All panels forward of the intake and five feet aft of the intake must be properly
installed and fasteners torqued IAW applicable TOs.
1.4.3.1.9. (Added) The anti-personnel screen will be used for all maintenance runs.
1.4.3.1.9.1. (Added) The anti-personnel screen will be inspected for serviceability and proper installation

completion of engine run.
1.4.3.1.10. (Added) All aircraft engine runs will have constant UHF radio contact with the Control Tower
during all phases of operation. When requested, MOC will provide a weather advisory prior to engine
start. If the aircraft UHF radio is inoperative or the Control Tower is closed, the run will be monitored by
a maintenance vehicle with FM radio capability or hand held radio (either will be dedicated to the main-
tenance engine run). MOC will notify the Control Tower or Command Post by telephone of intended
engine run.
1.4.3.1.11. (Added) Prior to any aircraft engine operation the following information will be called into
MOC and recorded in the run log:

vidual Training Update access. Must be knowledgeable on engine run procedures of the wings current air-
craft MDS/engine configuration.
1.4.3.1.17.7. (Added) Engine Run Manager duties and responsibilities: maintain current course status
report. Ensure a timely review and revisal of engine run test material is accomplished annually and when
changes to technical data dictate. Temporarily decertify individuals who fail first testing until they retest
and pass (remind individuals they cannot retest earlier than 24 hours or no later than 72 hours of initial
testing, early or late testing is synonymous with test failure). Ensure immediate supervisory notification
of an individuals decertification due to test failure as prescribed by this supplement. Ensure individuals
who go overdue on testing are immediately decertified on all their annual tests and inform tester of the
need to re-accomplish the annual testing requirements. Maintain file of testing and engine run certifica-
tion related AF Form 2426’s for the past 60 days. In general, the engine run manager will uphold the

ority over uninstalled engine runs.
1.4.3.3.1.1.1. (Added) When performing checks requiring settings up to 85% RPM (80% RPM for block
52 aircraft), the engine run person will ensure ground personnel have cleared the area behind the operat-
ing engine and ensure aircraft, personnel and/or equipment are not in danger. If the procedure cannot be
performed at 85% RPM (80% RPM for block 52 aircraft) or there is doubt about the safety of other per-
sonnel, aircraft and/or equipment the engine maintenance run will be delayed until the proper safety area
can be adhered to.
1.4.3.3.1.1.2. (Added) During hours of darkness position a light-all in front of each engine to be operated
to improve visibility.
1.4.3.3.1.1.3. (Added) All engine runs will require the use of at least one serviceable flight line (150 lb)
fire extinguisher which will be placed at the aircraft location.

1.5.3. (Added) For most maintenance engine runs a standby fire vehicle is not necessary. Response time
from the Fire Station is adequate. A standby fire truck is required for initial F-16 preserved engine runs
and fuel or oil line and component leak checks at the discretion of the production superintendent and fire
chief. External fuel tank leak and transfer checks are exempt from this requirement. These vehicles
remain in the vicinity until the integrity of the fuel and oil system has been verified. Ensure adequate
lighting is used during nighttime engine runs to facilitate leak detection. If the fire fighting vehicle is
required to respond to an emergency the engine run need not be terminated provided the initial leak check
was completed and no problems were observed. When running engines in the Hush House or T-9 noise
suppresser a fire fighting vehicle must be present if the Hush House or T-9 noise suppresser Fire Suppres-
sion System is not fully operational.
