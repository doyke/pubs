SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction has been revised and reorganized to incorporate operations and maintenance
reorganization and officially provides direct liaison between EWIR event coordinators and
affected base wide organizations. The AAR-47 Missile Warning System (MWS) was added to
the list of EWIR eligible systems at Osan AB, ROK. Deletes the requirement for a Terminal
Area Security Officer (TASO) since it is not necessary. Incorporates OSK Pacerware webpage.
Aligns maintenance manning requirements IAW actual manning. Adds attachments 3, 4, 5, 6.

1. General.
    1.1. The EWIR process reprograms Electronic Warfare (EW) systems rapidly and efficiently
    to meet changing threats. The 51 FW systems affected are the ALR-69 and ALR-56M Radar
    Warning Receivers (RWR), the ALQ-184 Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) Pod, the ALE-
    47 Countermeasures Dispenser System (CMDS), the ALQ-213 Countermeasures Set (CMS),
    the AAR-47 MWS, and the ALE-50 Advanced Airborne Expendable Decoy (AAED).
    1.2. This instruction only applies to the 51 FW. Tenant units stationed at Osan AB have
    separate procedures.
    1.3. 51 FW will be notified of EWIR actions through a PACER WARE (PW) message for
    real world software changes affecting combat aircraft or a SERENE BYTE (SB) message to
    exercise all or part of the EWIR process. PW messages are normally generated by Eglin’s
    53rd Wing Reprogramming Center (RC) but a SB may be generated by any level of the
    EWIR process, from the RC to an event coordinator, to exercise the EWIR process.
    1.4. Timeliness is a critical element of EWIR. The 51 FW goal is to have the first system
    reprogrammed within two hours of the IMP receipt or 51 OG/CC approval, whichever occurs
    last. Upon 51 OG/CC or Implementation Message (IMP) receipt, the Maintenance
    Operations Center (MOC) will be notified with a time/date stamp.
    1.5. The primary event coordinator for all 51 FW EWIR is the Wing ECP. The Wing ECP’s
    office is 51 OSS/OSK, Wing Weapons and Tactics. Alternate event coordinators are
    designated by the Wing ECP and are normally members of 51 OSS/OSK, the 36 FS/ECP, the
    25 FS/ECP, or the MXG EW Program Manager (Wing Avionics Manager – 51 MXQ/QA).
    The event coordinator is authorized to coordinate directly with all affected base organizations
    to facilitate an efficient and effective EWIR process. See Attachment 2 for a phone contact
    list.
2. Responsibilities:
    2.1. 51 OG/CC:

     2.11.4. Notify 51 FW ECP when unable to maintain a secure communications medium
     such as SIPRNET, STU-III/STE, or KY-68 phone line.
3. EWIR Flow:
  3.1. An EWIR event normally starts with the arrival of a SB or PW message via the 51
  FW/PW and 51 FW/OC classified AMHS inboxes. The 51 FW/PW account is checked daily
  by the 51 FW ECP, 36 FS and 25 FS ECPs, or other alternate event coordinators during
  normal duty hours (24hrs during contingencies / exercises). The 51 FW/OC account is
  monitored by the Command Post 24hrs. The 51 FW/OC will contact the 51 FW ECP after
  normal duty hours (0700-1700 M-F) if a high priority (―IMMEDIATE‖) message is
  received, and when ANY message is received during contingencies / exercises. The 51
  FW/OC will forward the message to the appropriate organizational mailboxes IAW
  paragraph 2.9.1. above. If the 51 FW ECP is unavailable, the 51 FW/OC will contact the
  next person on the EWIR Event Coordinator letter. The contacted individual will then
  assume event coordinator responsibilities. PW messages are posted by Eglin to the PWDB
  and MSDDS (both monitored by the 51 FW ECP and FS ECPs). The Wing ECP or alternate
  event coordinator will download and post the messages to the 51 OSS Weapons and Tactics
  SIPRNET website for maintenance personnel to download. The SIPRNET website address
  is: http://www.osan.af.smil.mil/51oss/Weapons-Tactics/tactics.html. The normal flow
  and definition of EWIR messages expected by the 51 FW are as follows:
     3.1.1. System Impact Message (SIM): EWIR message that describes parametric changes
     to threats and details what effect the changes will have on a particular aircraft EW
     system. Maintenance organizations should prepare to reprogram the identified EW
     systems by gathering the required equipment and ensuring they have access to SIPRNET
     and the MSDDS.
     3.1.2. Reprogramming Impact Message (RIM): EWIR message that normally follows a
     SIM that details how the RC plans to compensate for the change in the threat and how the
     reprogramming actions affect a particular EW system. A Time Compliance Technical
     Order (TCTO) or Maintenance Instruction Message (MIM) may also arrive to provide
     detailed reprogramming procedures for maintenance personnel.                Maintenance
     organizations should follow the procedures contained in the MIM (if applicable) and load
     the software identified in the RIM, MIM, and TCTO into their reprogramming
     equipment.
     3.1.3. IMP: EWIR message providing authorization from higher headquarters to
     reprogram the affected EW systems. However, maintenance organizations will not
     reprogram aircraft and / or ECM pods without approval from the 51FW ECP or alternate
6                                                             51FWI10-703 29 MARCH 2010


       event coordinator. The 51FW ECP or alternate event coordinator will brief the 51
       OG/CC on the effect of the EWIR and determine the appropriate time to load the affected
       EW system based on current real-time conditions. 51 OG/CC approval will be
       disseminated by the 51FW ECP or alternate event coordinator.
           3.1.3.1. In accordance with the standing (U) DMS ROUTINE, PW IMP GLOBAL
           PW 08 ACC01 (U) message, dated 141348Z Feb 08, IMP messages are NO
           LONGER going to be issued. This message serves as HQ ACC/A3I blanket
           authorization to install all EW system mission data released by the 53EWG, as
           specified in the respective RIM messages. DO NOT WAIT FOR AN IMP
           MESSAGE TO BE RECEIVED. The RIM should specify in the message body that
           it alone is IMP authorization and reference the ACC GLOBAL IMP message above.
           51 OG/CC approval is still required before reprogramming any EW system.
    3.2. The interval between messages can vary from a few hours during a SB exercise to
    several months for a PW dealing with a routine software upgrade. Following the RIM,
    reprogramming software will be available for maintenance to download on the MSDDS.
    3.3. The event coordinator will follow the 51 FW Form 10, 51 FW EWIR Event
    Coordination Checklist, and monitor the reprogramming process. All 51 FW EWIR
    organizations will follow instructions given by the event coordinator and applicable EWIR
    messages provided to them. Verbal instructions from the event coordinator are all that are
    required to perform steps in the EWIR process.
    3.4. Time permitting, the event coordinator will make an effort to provide a copy of the
    EWIR messages to all 51 FW EWIR organizations, but this is not necessary for maintenance
    to prepare for reprogramming activities. Both FS ECPs, and the event coordinator as a back-
    up, must provide a copy of the appropriate reprogramming software to the appropriate
    maintenance organizations if they are unable to download the software from MSDDS in a
    timely manner.
    3.5. The 51 FW EWIR process is designed to be flexible and survivable, and as such
    maintenance organizations will be prepared to aid other sections with their reprogramming
    activity by providing extra equipment and personnel that are trained and compatible with the
    affected EW system.
    3.6. All units will compile their reprogramming times, pertinent actions, and problems
    encountered when reprogramming ceases and pass this information to the 51 FW ECP, the
    Wing Avionics Manager, and MOC as soon as possible. The 51 FW Form 101 and the 51
    FW Form 102 will be used to annotate this data and are available at the Air Force e-
    Publishing website: http://www.e-publishing.af.mil. These forms are unclassified.
    3.7. The 51 FW ECP or alternate event coordinator will use the compiled data to generate
    the Unit Loading Message (ULM). For a PW, the ULM should be generated when the
    readily available aircraft or ECM pods are reprogrammed. A statement will be included in
    the ULM explaining why the remaining units were not reprogrammed and when the
    reprogramming is projected to be complete. For a SB, the ULM will be composed when the
    required number of systems is reprogrammed. The event coordinator will inform the 51
    OG/CC and MOC when reprogramming is complete.
