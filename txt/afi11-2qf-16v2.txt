                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. All evaluations will be conducted IAW the provisions of AFI 11-202V2 and this
volume. (T-2).
1.2. Waivers. Waiver authority for this publication is ACC/A3. Waivers will be requested
from the ACC through appropriate channels.
1.3. Procedures.
   1.3.1. Flight examiners (FEs) will use the evaluation criteria contained in Chapter 3 for
   conducting flight evaluations and Chapter 4 for emergency procedure evaluations (EPE). To
   ensure standard and objective evaluations, FE will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed
   evaluation criteria. (T-2).
   1.3.2. Recording devices (video recorders (DVR/VTR), air combat maneuvering
   instrumentation, etc.) should be used, when available, to reconstruct/evaluate the mission.
   1.3.3. Unless specified, the examinee or FE may fly in any flight position/seat (to include
   chase) which will best enable the FE to conduct a thorough evaluation.
   1.3.4. The FE will brief the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and how it will be
   conducted prior to flight. The examinee will accomplish required flight planning in
   accordance with the flight position during the evaluation. Higher Headquarters FEs (and unit
   FEs as determined locally) may assist in mission planning/briefing as tasked and will be
   furnished a copy of necessary mission data, mission materials, and data transfer cartridge
   loads. (T-2).
   1.3.5. The FE will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the evaluation. This debrief will include
   the examinee's overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than
   qualified) and any required additional training. (T-2).
1.4. Grading Instructions. Standards and performance parameters are contained in AFI 11-
202V2 and this instruction.
   1.4.1. Grading assumes smooth air and a stable aircraft baseline. Momentary deviations from
   tolerances are acceptable provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action and such
   deviations do not jeopardize flying safety. The FE will consider cumulative deviations when
   determining the overall grade.
   1.4.2. Examinees will brief and fly the desired airspeed/AOA for approaches and SFO
   parameters. (T-2).
   1.4.3. Appropriate area grades will be assigned by comparing examinee performance against
   standards per Chapter 3. The overall flight evaluation grade will be derived from individual
   area grades based on a composite for the observed events and tasks. (T-2).
      1.4.3.1. FE judgment must be exercised for applying subjective area grades, for specific
      situations not covered, and for assigning the overall grade.
 4                                                             AFI11-2QF-16V2 10 JULY 2014


        1.4.3.2. If the examinee receives an unqualified area grade in any of the critical areas
        identified by this volume, an overall qualification level of "Q-3" will be assigned. (T-2).

Table 1.1. General Criteria.

 The following general criteria apply at all times unless more restrictive
 in Chapter 3:

 Q         Altitude        +/- 200 feet

           Airspeed        +/- 5%

           Course          +/- 5 degrees/3 NM (whichever is greater)

           TACAN Arc       < 3NM



 Q-        Altitude        +/- 300 feet

           Airspeed        +/- 10%

           Course          +/- 10 degrees/5 NM (whichever is greater)

           TACAN Arc       > 3NM



 U                         Exceeded Q- limits
1.5. Emergency Procedures Evaluation. In order of preference, the EPE will be conducted in
a flight simulator/unit training device (UTD), cockpit procedure trainer (CPT), or verbally. Only
conduct a verbal EPE if a flight simulator/UTD or CPT is not available or not configured
appropriately for the evaluation. Grading criteria for each required item are listed in Chapter 4.
This evaluation will include areas commensurate with examinee's qualification(s) as listed
on the squadron letter of qualifications (LOXs)."
     1.5.1. The following items are required on all Emergency Procedure Evaluations: All
     Critical Action Procedures (CAP) will be evaluated by the examinee completing a written
     CAP test at the beginning of the EPE and executing all CAPs during the EPE. Any
     incorrectly completed written CAP will result in a “U”. The EPE will not be started until
     successful completion of the written CAP. (T-2).
        1.5.1.1. In addition to the CAP requirement in paragraph 1.5.1, additional "non-CAP"
        emergency procedures will be evaluated. Non-CAP emergency procedures will be
        selected from Table 2.2. (T-2)
AFI11-2QF-16V2 10 JULY 2014                                                                      5


         1.5.1.1.1. A minimum of one additional emergency procedure from the Ground
         Emergencies Section of Chapter 3 of the T.O. 1F-16XX-1 (XX denotes model - A/C)
         1.5.1.1.2. A minimum of one additional emergency procedure from the Takeoff
         Emergencies Section of Chapter 3 of the T.O. 1F-16XX-1 (XX denotes model - A/C)
         1.5.1.1.3. A minimum of two additional emergency procedures from the In-flight
         Emergencies Section of Chapter 3 of the T.O. 1F-16XX-1 (XX denotes model - A/C)
         1.5.1.1.4. A minimum of one additional emergency procedure from the Landing
         Emergencies Section of Chapter 3 of the T.O. 1F-16XX-1 (XX denotes model - A/C)
     1.5.1.2. Aircraft General Knowledge.
     1.5.1.3. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM).
     1.5.1.4. Unusual Attitude Recoveries. This also fulfills the Area 15 (Unusual Attitude
     Recoveries) requirement for Instrument/Qualification (INSTM/QUAL) evaluations.
  1.5.2. All INSTM/QUAL EPEs will include the following additional items: (T-2).
     1.5.2.1. AFMAN 11-217, Instrument Flight Procedures. Evaluate a minimum of one
     heads-up display (HUD) –out approach and use of standby/emergency instruments.
     Emphasis should be on whether the approach would permit a safe landing.
     1.5.2.2. Alternate/divert airfields. Evaluate a minimum of one approach at other than
     home base.
  1.5.3. All Mission (MSN) EPEs will include the following items (tailor MSN evaluation
  scenarios to unit tasking/mission). (T-2).
     1.5.3.1. Remote Control Operations and malfunctions.
     1.5.3.2. Chase aircraft considerations during unmanned QF-16 flight/emergency.
  1.5.4. Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade will be placed in supervised status
  until recommended additional training is completed and/or a reevaluation is successfully
  accomplished. Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade because of an unsatisfactory
  CAP accomplishment will not be permitted to fly until a successful reevaluation is
  accomplished. For EPEs in which the examinee is qualified, but requires additional training,
  the FE will indicate whether the additional training will be accomplished before the next
  flight. Additional training and reevaluations will be accomplished IAW AFI 11-202V2. (T-
  2).
  1.5.5. In situations where INSTM/QUAL and MSN evaluation eligibility zones overlap,
  a single EPE may be administered to fulfill the requisites for a combined
  MSN/INSTM/QUAL evaluations. The combined EPE must be of sufficient scope and length
  to ensure all required areas for each evaluation are accomplished. (T-3).
  1.5.6. The following grading criteria will be used to grade individual items on EPEs: (T-2).
     1.5.6.1. Q. Performance is correct. Quickly recognizes and corrects errors.
     1.5.6.2. Q-. Performance is safe, but indicates limited proficiency. Makes errors of
     omission or commission.
     1.5.6.3. U. Performance is unsafe or indicates lack of knowledge or ability
 6                                                              AFI11-2QF-16V2 10 JULY 2014


                                             Chapter 2

                               EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General.
     2.1.1. All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-202V2. (T-2).
     2.1.2. Required areas for flight evaluations are detailed in Table 2.1 and Table 2.2 for EPEs
     When it is impractical or not possible to accomplish a required flight evaluation area in-
     flight, it may be evaluated by an alternate method (i.e., simulator/UTD, CPT, or by verbal
     examination) in order to complete the evaluation. (T-3). Document the reason and type of
     alternate method used in the Comments portion of the AF Form 8. If the FE determines the
     required item cannot be adequately evaluated by an alternate method, the examinee will
     require an additional flight to complete the evaluation. (T-3).
        2.1.2.1. Areas annotated with an "R" are required items for that evaluation.
        2.1.2.2. Areas annotated with an R1 require evaluation of at least one of the items under
        the associated section and category for that evaluation (All CAPs are required to be
        accomplished for both INSTM/QUAL and MSN evaluations).
        2.1.2.3. Areas indicated with an R2 require evaluation of at least two of the items under
        the associated section for that evaluation (All CAPs are required to be
        accomplished for both INSTM/QUAL and MSN evaluations).
     2.1.3. Publications Check.Currency of Flight Publications. Evaluate all                 issued
     publications/checklists for currency and accuracy on all flight evaluations. (T-2).
     2.1.4. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM). In accordance with AFI 11-290,
     Cockpit/Crew Resource Management, CRM skills will be evaluated during all evaluations.
     (T-2). CRM skills are integral to all phases of flight and are embedded within specific
     grading criteria. Therefore, no specific evaluation criteria area titled CRM exists. As all the
     CRM skills listed on the AF Form 4031, CRM Skills Training/ Evaluation Form, are
     included/embedded, use of the Form 4031 is unnecessary for evaluations in the F-16. The
     Stan/Eval trend program can be used to measure the effectiveness of CRM training.
     2.1.5. Combined Evaluations. Combined evaluations flown must fulfill all current
     INSTM/QUAL and MSN evaluation requirements, including ground phase requisites. (T-2).
     One EPE may be accomplished that encompasses requirements of both EPEs, with additional
     simulator time as required to complete all items. (T-3).
2.2. Instrument/Qualification Evaluation. A mission flown according to instrument flight
rules (to the maximum extent practical) best fulfills the objective of the INSTM/QUAL
evaluation. To the maximum extent possible, this evaluation will include approaches at airfields
other than home or deployed locations. Approaches may be flown to fields which have a non-
published, practice approach available (e.g. Visual Flight Rules (VFR) conditions only
approach), but not a published FLIP approach. The intent is to grade instrument procedures
which are independent of an approach’s certification (to use a non- published approach, the
approach plate must be built using the standards applied to published approach plates, local OGV
must approve use of the approach, and approval for the approach to must be documented in the
AFI11-2QF-16V2 10 JULY 2014                                                                       7


local unit supplement to AFI 11-202V2). This evaluation may be administered on any
compatible training mission. When B/D model aircraft are available, pilots may complete their
INSTM/QUAL evaluation with an FE occupying the rear cockpit. (T-3).
   2.2.1. Minimum ground phase requisites are: (T-2).
       2.2.1.1. Instrument examination.
       2.2.1.2. Closed and open book qualification examinations.
       2.2.1.3. EPE.
       2.2.1.4. CAP Written Exam. Answers must contain all critical action items in proper
       sequence. Abbreviations are allowed.
2.3. Mission Evaluation. MSN evaluations will be flown IAW current unit taskings and will
incorporate all appropriate evaluation requirements from Table 2.1. The profiles will be
designed to evaluate the training/flight position/special qualifications as well as basic airmanship
of the examinee. Initial MSN evaluations will be given IAW syllabus. Examinees will be
evaluated in the position of their highest qualification. At the FE’s discretion, portions may be
flown in another position, but the emphasis is to have examinees evaluated at their highest
qualification level. Examinees will only be evaluated on those areas for which they are qualified.
(T-2).
   2.3.1. QF-16 mission evaluations require remote control operations using the Drone
   Formation System and will normally be flown on a Fixed Control Site (FCS) profile.
   2.3.2. When 2-seat QF-16D aircraft are available, pilots will complete this evaluation with
   the FE in the RCP. If a 2-seat aircraft is not available, the FE evaluates in a chase aircraft
   with Operations Officer approval. (T-2).
   2.3.3. Minimum ground phase requisites are: (T-2).
       2.3.3.1. EPE.
       2.3.3.2. CAP Written Exam. Answers must contain all critical action items in proper
       sequence. Abbreviations are allowed.
2.4. Formal Course Evaluation. Syllabus evaluations will be flown IAW syllabus mission
profile guidelines if stated, or on a mission profile developed from syllabus training objectives.
Formal course guidelines may be modified, based on local operating considerations or FE
judgment, to complete the evaluation. Training objectives and related areas will be graded using
the performance criteria in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4. (T-3).
2.5. Instructor Evaluation. Instructor evaluations will be conducted IAW AFI 11-202V2. (T-
2).
   2.5.1. Initial Flight Evaluation. To initially qualify as an instructor in the QF-16, the pilot
   must successfully complete an initial instructor evaluation. This is a one-time evaluation in
   which the examinee must demonstrate ability to instruct in some phase of the unit's mission.
   Except for requirements delineated under Area 33, Instructor Performance, in Chapter 3,
   specific profiles and/or events will be determined by the flight examiner. (T-3).
   2.5.2. Subsequent aircrew evaluations (i.e. INSTM/QUAL and MSN) will include instructor
   portions during the evaluations. (T-2).
 8                                                              AFI11-2QF-16V2 10 JULY 2014


2.6. Instructor Pilot Rear Cockpit Landing Evaluations. An evaluation of rear cockpit
landings will be completed prior to performing rear cockpit landing instructor duties. These
duties include instruction for and demonstration of landings during initial qualification training,
requalification training, or additional training. (T-2)
     2.6.1. Examinees will complete the evaluation as follows: (T-2).
        2.6.1.1. All rear cockpit landing qualification evaluations will include satisfactory
        demonstration of overhead and emergency patterns, and a landing performed from the
        rear cockpit.
        2.6.1.2. IPs will accomplish the rear cockpit landing qualification during either the
        INSTM/QUAL evaluation sortie, the MSN evaluation sortie or during another sortie as a
        requisite. 53 WEG will specify when the rear cockpit landing qualification will be
        completed and identify procedures for completion of this requirement in the unit
        supplement to AFI 11-202V2.
     2.6.2. When the rear cockpit landing qualification is evaluated during a separate sortie as a
     requisite for a flight evaluation, record "SPOT" in the Flight Phase block on the AF Form 8.
     Describe the purpose of the evaluation as "Rear Cockpit Landing Qualification" in the
     Mission Description section of the Comments block. In addition, FEs will document all
     discrepancies on the AF Form 8 in Section IV, paragraph B, under a sub-paragraph after the
     EPE discrepancies as follows: "2. Rear Cockpit Landing Qualification." If no discrepancies
     are identified, enter "None" after the sub-paragraph title. A sub-paragraph 3 would then be
     used for flight discrepancies. If a reevaluation is required, an additional "SPOT" entry will be
     recorded in the Flight Phase block on the front of the AF Form 8. Additional training will be
     documented IAW AFI 11-202V2. (T-3).
     2.6.3. An initial rear cockpit landing qualification may be conducted independently of
     another evaluation. FEs will document completion of this Rear Cockpit Landing
     Qualification as a "SPOT" evaluation on an AF Form 8. Evaluate RCP landing qualification
     on all subsequent INSTM/QUAL evaluations.             It may be an additional sortie on the
     INSTM/QUAL evaluation, and documented as SPOT. If the entire INSTM/QUAL evaluation
     sortie is flown from the RCP and RCP landing requirements IAW AFI 11-2MDS-Vol2 are
     met, annotate the AF Form 8 with an INSTM/QUAL flight only, and add rear cockpit
     landing qualification in the mission description on the back of the AF Form 8. (T-3).

 1. Airwork/Advanced Handling/Tactical Maneuvering. This area is required for pilots receiving
 INSTM/QUAL evaluations. Maneuvers can be:
      a. Aerobatics
      b. Advanced handling characteristics / Horn Awareness and Recovery Training Series / Confidence
      maneuvers
      c. Any Air-to-air mission (Basic Fighter Maneuvers (BFM), Air Combat Maneuvering, Air Combat
      Training, adversary training aid etc.)
      d. Formation (fingertip, tactical, trail)
 2. Unusual Attitude Recoveries. Do not perform unusual attitude recoveries in single seat aircraft.
 *3. Simulated Flame Out (SFO) Traffic Patterns/Approach/Landing. Pilots unable to accomplish an
 SFO during their INSTM/QUAL evaluation may delay this emergency traffic pattern/approach
 requirement until their next periodic evaluation (usually a MSN evaluation). When delayed until the
 next periodic evaluation, that evaluation will be incomplete until the SFO is accomplished. Verbal
 evaluation of an SFO is never approved.
 4. Precision Approach. Both a PAR and an ILS must be evaluated if equipment and facilities are
 available. If facilities or equipment are not available, the flight evaluation may be completed as long as
 one precision approach is flown. Annotate type of approach(es) flown in the Mission Description on the
 AF Form-8.
