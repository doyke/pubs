       another SAV will be conducted at the end of 90 days. The SBRPT will provide assistance/
       guidance at the unit’s request, but will not correct the finding for the unit. The write-up will
       contain the same information as the initial write-up and will be forwarded to the attention of the
       appropriate Group Commander.
       6.3.3. Unit Monitor. Observations, recommendations, and suggestions are made to the unit
       monitor to help standardize procedures when clear-cut guidance is not provided in the
       publication. References to the SAV checklist items and regulations will be made when possible.
       Observations and recommendations are not considered binding to the unit and will not be
       enforced.
7. SORTS Remarks Guidance. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) directs the use of
remarks in the SORTS report. Remarks are used to explain the problem a unit may have in
3WGI10-204 7 AUGUST 2003                                                                                 9


accomplishing its wartime mission. Remarks are semi-formatted, allowing commanders to write about a
specific measured area of the report using a “label” with limited space. Commanders may include a
remark anytime they feel it necessary to explain a situation; however, certain situations require a remark.
   7.1. The need for a remark is driven primarily by the C-Level for each of the four measured areas
   and the unit’s overall C-Level. If the unit is less than C-1 in any measured area, a remark is required
   for that measured area and the unit’s overall C-Level (REASN).
   7.2. Remark Narrative. The remark narrative should include, but is not limited to, the following:
       7.2.1. A full explanation of why the measured area is less than C-1, the impact on the unit, and
       the actions being taken to correct the problems.
       7.2.2. Progressive estimates of C-level changes and get well dates.
       7.2.3. Use of common abbreviations-ACRONYMS must be spelled out the first time in the
       report.
       7.2.4. Required Remarks; CJCS, Air Force, and major commands (MAJCOM) direct the use of
       remark labels to be used. See attachment 1 for mandatory remarks.
8. Forms Adopted:
   8.1. Adopted: AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, and OF 21, Cross-
   Reference.
