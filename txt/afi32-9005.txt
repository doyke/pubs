This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 32-90, Real Property Asset Management,
Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 4165.70, Real Property Management, and DODI 4165.14,
Real Property Inventory and Forecasting. It provides procedures for establishing financial and physical
accountability and designating installations. It provides guidance for maintaining Real Property (RP)
records and reporting RP assets according to Air Force and DoD issued policies, guidance, and proce-
dures. This instruction applies to all unclassified RP under the custody and control of the Department of
the Air Force, including Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG) units, and
the industrial RP that is contractor–operated and under the control of the Deputy Assistant Secretary
(Management Policy and Program Integration). Field activities must send implementing publications or
supplements to the higher Headquarters Air Force OPR for review and coordination prior to publication.
No waivers may be granted for any part of this instruction.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This Air Force Instruction (AFI) has been completely revised and should be thoroughly reviewed. It has
been completely rewritten and contains new requirements and procedures to comply with applicable laws,
federal requirements, and DoD direction. There are new chapters on Roles and Responsibilities, Accept-
ing Real Property and Inventorying Real Property. Several checklists were also added as attachments to
provide sample documents for Real Property Officer’s use.

                                            INTRODUCTION

1.1. Overview. The Air Force Real Property Inventory (RPI) contains the data upon which all installa-
tion-level engineering RP activities are linked. Decision-makers at all levels of the organization use the
data in the RPI to allocate resources, plan for new missions, sustain the assets they steward, and dispose
of property when no longer needed for military use. Recent transformational initiatives across the Depart-
ment of Defense (DoD) and the federal RP community focused on further developing, refining, and using
installation data for the full range of planning, acquiring, sustaining, and disposing of these assets. This
instruction is for use by the engineering community to establish records, track and report changes, addi-
tions, and deletions to the Air Force RPI.

1.2. Applicability. With the exception of the properties addressed below, this instruction applies to all
unclassified RP under the custody and control of the Department of the Air Force (AF), owned, leased, or
otherwise acquired and controlled by the AF, including AFRC and ANG. Real property held for adminis-
trative accountability for Defense and other federal agencies is also governed by this policy. Activities in
this instruction are performed at installations worldwide by AF staff also involved in real estate transac-
tions governed under direction separate from this instruction.
     1.2.1. Information about the inventory is unclassified and is available to the public under the Freedom
     of Information Act after coordination with HQ AF Installation Management and Operations Branch,
     Asset Management Division, Office of The Civil Engineer (AF/A7CAI).
     1.2.2. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this instruction are main-
     tained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance
     with the AF Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.af.mil/.
     1.2.3. Refer recommended changes and questions about this instruction to AF/A7CAI using the AF
     Information Management Tool (IMT) 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication. Route IMT
     847 from the field through the appropriate chain of command.
     1.2.4. This instruction does not apply to these types of property:
         1.2.4.1. Property in an officially designated combat zone
         1.2.4.2. Property acquired in support of peacekeeping missions
         1.2.4.3. Property in the National Industrial Reserve
         1.2.4.4. Property disposed of subject to right of recapture of National Security Clause, unless such
         property is under AF military control
         1.2.4.5. Property acquired or constructed for contingency operations

1.3. Overall Responsibility. The Deputy Assistant Secretary of the AF, Installations (SAF/IEI) provides
overall guidance and direction for Air Force RP asset management. The Air Force Real Property Agency
(AFRPA) serves as the Air Force execution agent for managing real estate acquisition, management and
disposal. The Air Force Civil Engineer (AF/A7C) is responsible for installation management and account-
ability of the AF RPI. These requirements and procedures are outlined in AFI 32-9001 through AFI
32-9004 and Air Force Handbook (AFH) 32-9007.

1.4. Definitions and Terms. See Attachment 1.

     REAL PROPERTY ACCOUNTABILITY AUTHORITIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

Section 2A—Major Authorities Requiring Real Property Accountability

2.1. Chief Financial Officers Act (CFOA) of 1990. This act established the framework to improve fed-
eral financial management and establish roles and responsibilities in key financial management, leader-
ship and accountability functions. The CFOA is intended to:
   2.1.1. Provide more effective general and financial management practices within the federal govern-
   ment.
   2.1.2. Provide the framework for each agency of the federal government to improve accountability,
   financial management and internal controls.
   2.1.3. Ensure the reporting of reliable financial information, deterring potential fraud, waste and
   abuse of government resources.
   2.1.4. Provide for the production of complete, reliable, timely, and consistent financial information
   for use by the Executive Branch and the Congress.
   2.1.5. Provide reports of RP holdings on a periodic basis.

2.2. Executive Order (EO) 13327, Federal Real Property Asset Management. This EO superseded
EO 12512 and affects all federal RP. In addition to requirements addressed in DoD instructions, it requires
an annual report that lists and describes RP assets under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of that
agency, except for classified information, and any other relevant information the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) or the Administrator of General Services may request for inclusion in
the Government-wide lists of all Federal RP assets and leased property. EO 13423, Strengthening Federal
Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management, amended EO 13327.

2.3. DoD Instruction (DODI) 4165.14, Real Property Inventory and Forecasting. T h i s d i r e c t i v e
stipulates standardized nomenclature and provides a standardized format for annual reporting of military
RP at the asset level to the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense, Installations, and Environ-
ment (DUSD I&E). Note that the direction contained in EO 13327, are implemented in DODI 4165.14;
the AF is not directly addressed in the EO.

2.4. DODI 4165.70, Real Property Management. This instruction stipulates roles and responsibilities
of DoD, Military Departments, and Defense Components in the management of DoD RP. It requires Mil-
itary Departments to maintain accurate and complete RP inventories for all unclassified RP assets in
which they have a legal interest and report a detailed inventory as of September 30 to the DUSD (I&E)
annually but not later than December 15.

                                     REAL PROPERTY PLANNING

Section 3A—Real Property Reports Support Installation and Service Planning

3.1. Purpose. The RPI contains a large amount of data to support base operations, project management
and facility maintenance. It is a primary tool used to support basic functions in installation planning. In
addition to the active installation database, the AF also reports data to outside entities for use in their plan-
ning and funding allocations. The data for, and focus of, each of these reports is substantially different.
The AF submits three major reports from the RPI quarterly or annually:
    3.1.1. The AF financial statement reports cost and value data for all RP the AF uses in accomplish-
    ment of its mission. Reported data also includes depreciation, capital improvement, and disposal
    actions. The Electronic Systems Group (ELSG) extracts the data from the database(s) and transmits it
    to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) at required intervals. DoD 7000.14-R, DoD
    Financial Management Regulation, Volume 4, Chapter 6, contains the requirements. Web address is
    defenselink.mil/comptroller/fmr.
    3.1.2. The AF reports data annually for all assets for which AF has any accountability (including
    non-owned) to the FRPC and General Services Administration (GSA) for intragovernmental planning
    and reporting. Web address is FRPP@gsa.gov.
    3.1.3. The AF provides annually the Physical Accountability and Forecasting Report to DoD for anal-
    ysis and aggregation with Army and Navy data for DoD planning and funding. The reports include
    specific data identified in DODI 4165.14 on all assets for which AF has any accountability (including
    non-owned). DoD publishes segregated data annually in the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD)
    Base Structure Report. Web addresses are dtic.mil/whs/directives and www.acq.osd.mil/ie/irm/
    index.html.

3.2. End-of-Year Inventory Detail Reports. Specific installation data are consolidated at end of fiscal
year, transmitted to DoD, and made available from the AF Data Services for data queries by users with
access to the AF Portal for various planning requirements.

3.3. Interfaces of ACES Data to Other Systems. ACES RP data interfaces with other AF, DoD, and
federal information systems. The ACES is the RP official system of record and holds the RP data with
which all others are linked: i.e., the unique identifiers for the asset, the site, and the installation. Note:
GEOBASE capability is dependant on ‘tabular’ metadata maintained in the RPI.

Section 3B—The DoD Real Property Inventory Requirements (RPIR) and Transformation

3.4. DoD-wide Real Property Inventory Requirements (RPIR). This initiative substantially changed
the ways in which all Services collect and manage installation data. Changes include:
    3.4.1. Adding and standardizing approximately 196 standard common data elements and definitions
    across the Services.
    3.4.2. Implementing Unique Identifiers (UID) for all RP sites and RP assets (RPA) to be issued from
    a common UID Registry operated by DoD.
12                                                                         AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008


     3.4.3. Re-characterizing installations and sites to establish a consistent, DoD standardization of all
     DoD nomenclature with the Real Property Unique Identifier (RPUID).
     3.4.4. Introducing the concept of more complete tracking of individual facility useful life and describ-
     ing utility and other systems in terms of segments to more accurately describe linear assets.
     3.4.5. See Attachment 9 - The RPIR Primer.

3.5. Coordination with Installation Planning. The RPIR plays an important part in short- and
long-range installation planning and development. The REO and Installation Community Planner coordi-
nate their separate activities and maintain a strong and close relationship on all matters related to Installa-
tion development. Planners and the REO should meet on a regular basis, at least quarterly to review
current and future development actions (sitings, future development plans, space utilization, leases, etc.)
The REO will review and provide comments and suggestions to revise the Base Comprehensive Plan.

     ACCEPTANCE OF REAL PROPERTY AND ACCOUNTING FOR REAL PROPERTY

Section 4A—Authorities for Acceptance of Real Property into the RPI

4.1. Policy and Procedures.
   4.1.1. Acquisition of AF RP requires a variety of actions and entry of applicable data into RPI records
   as acceptance by the federal government. The policies, procedures and activities involved in AF
   acquisition of RP are under the purview of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the AF, Installations and
   Environment (SAF/IEI). See AFI 32-9001, Acquisition of Real Property.
   4.1.2. Under DoD Business Processes Reengineering, the Installations & Environment (I&E), the
   DGB approved the Real Property Acceptance Requirements (RPAR) and established general DoD
   implementation requirements for acceptance of RP of all acquisition types. See Attachment 10, Real
   Property Acceptance Requirements Primer.
   4.1.3. The Real Property CIP Requirements (RPCIPR) approved by the I&E DGB identifies specific
   implementation requirements for recording and reporting CIP in the transfer and acceptance process.
   Additional instruction for accepting construction, found on base, and inventory adjustments are found
   in Unified Facility Criteria (UFC) for the Transfer and Acceptance of Real Property, 1-300-08, June
   2004.

4.2. Executive Agents. The Departments of the Army, Navy, AF, and Washington Headquarters Services
are the only executive agents in DoD entitled to ‘hold’ U.S. Government RP on their inventories. There-
fore, all RP on military installations either is accounted for by an executive agent or is privately owned
and operated, (i.e., some bank and credit union buildings and privatized housing and utilities). Defense
Agencies, non-appropriated fund (NAF) activities, (theaters, community centers, and some fitness cen-
ters) and Army Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) organizations occupy and control property that is
‘administratively’ accounted for by the military department holding the responsibility for annual reports
to OSD and GSA. Note: RP not actively used for the AF mission is not reported on the AF financial state-
ment.

Section 4B—Types of Real Property Acquisitions

4.3. Types of Acquisitions and Accountability Procedures.
   4.3.1. Acceptance of Fee Interest: Seven types of acquisitions require the REO to capitalize the asset.
   UFC 1-300-09 requires this action within 10 days of acceptance with source documentation sufficient
   to create a complete audit trail of the transaction. The seven acquisition types involve acceptance of/
   by:
       4.3.1.1. Purchased land with or without facilities,
       4.3.1.2. Revision of a previous contract,
       4.3.1.3. New construction or capital improvement to an existing asset,
       4.3.1.4. Condemnation processes,
14                                                                        AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008


        4.3.1.5. Transfer from another DoD Service,
        4.3.1.6. Transfer from another Federal Department, or
        4.3.1.7. A gift or donation.
     4.3.2. Land withdrawn from the public domain is accepted into the RPI as stewardship land and not
     capitalized. No cost is reported with public domain lands on any report. Note. Withdrawn lands are
     not capitalized.
     4.3.3. Acceptance of Fee Interest requires either a deed, a DD Form 1354 or its equivalent from any
     other entity and additional documentation. See RPAR (defenselink.mil/dbt/products) or Attach-
     ment 10.
     4.3.4. The creation of a Work in Progress (WIP) and or CIP account for RP assets must be dependant
     on the type of work, asset, and funding method. When a DoD entity is constructing a RP asset to be
     transferred to another DoD entity on a direct cite basis, the constructing entity must accumulate cost
     in a CIP account for the benefit of the fund owner. When a DoD entity is constructing a RP asset to be
     transferred to another DoD entity on a cost reimbursable basis, the constructing entity must accumu-
     late cost in a WIP account.
     4.3.5. Prior to performance of work, the scope of the work order must be approved. Each military
     construction project performed by construction agents must have both design and fund authorizations
     prior to initiating CIP or WIP. The civil engineering organization must provide the construction agent
     with a RPUID upon providing the official authorization to perform work on a RP construction project.
     4.3.6. The title for RP assets and improvements constructed on federal property, without regard to
     construction agent or fund source, will be held by the Federal Government.
     4.3.7. Each authorized work order for an in house minor construction project must be present to ini-
     tiate CIP. Each authorized work order for an in house minor construction project must have authorized
     funding prior to performance of work.
     4.3.8. Capitalization shall be accomplished within 10 days of Date Placed in Service. The date on the
     completed DD Form 1354 shall be the first date the facility may be occupied and depreciation of the
     asset begun. See Attachment 7 for RP Accounting Practices.
        4.3.8.1. “Original Asset Recorded Cost Amount” is the value identified for RP accepted in fee
        including gift (or donation) and purchase. The original entry in the RPI for donated RP must
        include the fair market value of that property in the “Estimated Value” field. That value amount is
        not depreciated and will not be changed unless the original structure is removed from the inven-
        tory or improved by donated funds. No government-funded improvement to a donated facility
        increases the “cost” or value of the facility for the record.
        4.3.8.2. All RP assets are recorded at cost. Cost includes all costs incurred to bring the asset to a
        form and location suitable for its intended use. When acquiring a General Property, Plant, and
        Equipment (PP&E) asset (including land and facilities), the purchase cost and other costs neces-
        sary to bring the asset to an operable condition are capitalized. If the General PP&E acquisition
        cost, including other costs necessary to bring the asset to an operable condition, do not equal or
        exceed DoD capitalization threshold, the costs are expensed in the period incurred.
        4.3.8.3. When an asset or an improvement to an asset is placed in service, the cost accumulated to
        date in the CIP account must be transferred to the appropriate General PP&E account and recorded
AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008                                                                                 15


      in the RP inventory. After the asset is placed in service, each additional cost incurred must be
      recorded in the CIP account until final acceptance and then transferred by RPUID to the appropri-
      ate General PP&E account. All additional project costs incurred following the placed in service
      date shall be transferred from the CIP account to the RP asset account by RPUID with the final
      Transfer and Acceptance of Military Real Property document. For construction projects that are
      completed in multiple phases, the cost of each phase is transferred from the CIP account to the RP
      asset account at the time the phase is placed in service. After the Real Property final acceptance is
      executed, each additional project cost must be expensed and must not be included in the CIP
      account.
      4.3.8.4. When a project is cancelled, each cost accumulated in CIP accounts must be expensed.
      When a portion of a project is cancelled or decreased in scope, the cost directly associated to that
      portion of the project and an allocated portion of the common cost in the CIP must be expensed.
      4.3.8.5. For a RP construction project, all costs for improvements that increase the useful life,
      efficiency, capacity, or size of an existing asset, or modifies the functionality or use of an asset
      shall be capitalized.
   4.3.9. For financial reporting purposes, portions of CIP reported by the construction agent and spon-
   soring entity must tie to the total amount of CIP reported for the project. Continue to report CIP on the
   financial statements until the RP asset is accepted.
   4.3.10. Contractors and others may retain title to facilities they construct for their use during the per-
   formance of a contract. The contractor must remove the structure or may donate it to the AF, if the AF
   elects to accept it. The BCE can accept the property by:
      4.3.10.1. Using a DD Form 1354, signed by an appropriate agent and accepted by the RPAO
      (mandatory) and marking it as “Found on Base" (mandatory).
      4.3.10.2. Coordinating these actions with Corps of Engineers representative (as necessary).
      4.3.10.3. Requiring a warranty deed from the owner to protect the government's interest (as nec-
      essary).
      4.3.10.4. Researching records on the asset to establish an initial cost and obtain any available
      source documentation.
   4.3.11. Each project deferred for more than two years must be reviewed for continuance or cancella-
   tion during the review cycle. Each CIP account in an abeyance status must be reviewed for continu-
   ance or cancellation during the review cycle.

4.4. Accepting New Construction from Construction Agents.
   4.4.1. Before acceptance of the RP asset, the RPAO or designee must acknowledge to the construc-
   tion agent that the RP asset is ready for acceptance prior. At the time of acceptance of the RP asset, the
   DoD construction agent and the RPAO will execute the DD Form 1354 document. The RP account-
   able officer will provide a copy of the executed DD Form 1354 document to the sponsoring entity at
   the acceptance transaction if the sponsoring entity is not the RP accountable Component for the asset.
   The RPAO or designee must ensure that all costs incurred by the sponsoring entity are provided to the
   construction agent on a formal document for inclusion in the full cost of the asset prior to acceptance.
16                                                                         AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008


     4.4.2. The REO capitalizes facilities or improvements to facilities at the full cost accumulated in the
     CIP account. At the time of acceptance, the amount accumulated in CIP will be relieved and trans-
     ferred to the appropriate asset account. What is documented on the Interim DD Form 1354 is the total
     cost accumulated in CIP at the time the asset is placed in service. The REO should not use project esti-
     mates or DD Form1391, Military Construction Project Data, to record/capitalize an asset. In the case
     of construction, the amount accumulated to date in the CIP account is the final cost paid for a facility
     and the amount that should show up on DD Form 1354, and it is not limited to what is reported on the
     contract documentation. Each supplier must provide invoices at the level of detail defined in the terms
     and conditions of the contract or order. The CIP amount is the full cost of a facility.
     4.4.3. Acceptance of new construction necessitates adding a capital asset to the RPI. That action,
     “Capitalization,” shall be accomplished within 10 days of the Date Placed in Service (formerly the
     Building Occupancy Date) using data from an Interim or Final DD Form 1354.
     4.4.4. The building, or portion thereof, may be occupied only after all parties sign the contract and the
     RPAO or designee signs the Interim DD Form 1354 (or Final DD Form 1354 if the entire facility is
     accepted at the time.) If entire facility is not accepted, the construction agent will continue the CIP
     account for construction not accepted on the Interim DD Form 1354 and relieve the CIP of the amount
     accepted by the AF.
     4.4.5. DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 4, Chapter 6, prescribes the financial management criteria and
     procedures for acceptance of CIP and effects on the general ledger control accounts. Close coordina-
     tion between the project manager, the RPAO, and the financial management or fiscal officer is neces-
     sary to ensure that the respective record balances for capitalized RP are in agreement. Attachment 7
     provides a summary overview of the financial management aspects associated with CIP.
     4.4.6. Accountability for all constructed assets will follow the requirements in UFC for Transfer and
     Acceptance of Military Real Property (UFC 1-300-08) and any revisions and the Real Property Con-
     struction-in-Progress Requirements (RPCIPR) (acq.osd.mil/ie/bei/library.htm).
     4.4.7. Upon receipt of the Final DD Form 1354 and completed construction documents, the REO
     shall adjust the ACES RP facility account to reflect the total final cost. Obtain the DD Form 1354 dur-
     ing final inspection of the facility either by attending in person or having an attendee obtain the docu-
     ment. The date on that document becomes the Date Acquired by the AF. The construction agent will,
     working with resources or funds personnel, ensure that the remainder of the CIP account is transferred
     to the General PP&E account at project close out/completion.

4.5. Accepting Construction Accomplished by the Base Civil Engineer (BCE).
     4.5.1. The BCE or local construction agent will prepare a DD Form 1354 for construction of all new
     facilities and other property meeting the criteria for capitalization, minor construction or alteration
     performed by local contractors or base labor. The BCE is the accepting official for the contract and the
     RPAO shall sign the DD Form 1354 and capitalize the facility within 10 days of Date Placed in Ser-
     vice.
     4.5.2. The cost of construction performed by local contract must include the costs of incidental trans-
     portation and military labor.

4.6. Record Total Cost. The CIP account(s) and the cost that is recorded at the time the asset is placed in
service may be a combination of both through an agent and locally controlled. Tracking of CIP requires a
AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008                                                                                  17


RPUID be established at the time the CIP record is established (see paragraph below, Reporting “Value”
of Construction-in-Progress). For example, design work may be done through a local contract by BCE
and the construction work may be done by a DoD construction agent. The REO must ensure that the cost
recorded for the asset placed in service includes total cost. The cost of the asset placed in service must
equal the sum of all construction and design costs. Indirect project cost must be allocated across CIP
accounts no later than final acceptance based on the direct cost of the asset as a percentage of the total
direct cost of all assets in the project. Note that preliminary planning cost accumulated prior to design
authorization must be expensed and not be captured in the CIP account. Total cost must include the fol-
lowing, if incurred:
   4.6.1. Contract work. Amounts paid for work performed under contract, to include items below if per-
   formed under contract, as well as any incentive fees paid to contractors to reward performance goals.
   The terms and conditions of a contract must include a provision, where applicable, that requires the
   supplier to provide estimated costs by RPUID(s) on invoices. A reasonable allocation methodology of
   costs will be determined after contract award for auditability.
   4.6.2. Total labor cost. The total costs of government burdened labor directly associated with the con-
   struction project. Includes both military and civilian labor costs, in accordance with current published
   DoD Comptroller annual reimbursable rates.
   4.6.3. Direct cost of materials and supplies. This includes the purchase price, the cost of inspection,
   and loading assumed by the carrier.
   4.6.4. Supervision, Inspection, and Overhead (SIOH). A fee applied to the cost of a construction con-
   tract to recover direct and indirect expenses for a project's construction management services.
   4.6.5. Transportation. Amounts paid for transportation of workers, materials, and supplies in connec-
   tion with the construction project.
   4.6.6. Handling and storage. Amount paid for packaging and storing the materials, supplies, and
   equipment used in the construction project.
   4.6.7. Injuries and damages. Costs incurred as a result of injuries to people or damage to property
   incurred directly as a result of the construction project.
   4.6.8. Legal and recording fees. Legal fees incurred to bring the asset to its intended use (e.g., title or
   recording fees).
   4.6.9. Architecture and engineering services. Amounts paid for engineering, architectural, and other
   outside services for designs, plans, specifications, and surveys. Costs for architecture & engineering
   (A&E) services must be capitalized in the RPI along with construction costs. See Attachment 7, RP
   Accounting Practices. If exact A&E costs cannot be determined, use 8% of the contract amount or the
   current prevailing rate provided in current guidelines and references. Cost of A&E services for
   projects never accomplished are expensed by engineers in the year the decision is made not to go for-
   ward with construction.
   4.6.10. Site and asset preparation. Amounts paid to prepare the site for new construction, such as soil
   removal, grading, and infill.
   4.6.11. Installed equipment. Fixed equipment and related installation costs required for a complete
   and usable asset.
18                                                                        AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008


     4.6.12. Usage Cost. The usage cost of the government furnished equipment, material, and facilities
     used in construction work.
     4.6.13. Donated assets. The fair market value of RP and installed equipment donated to the govern-
     ment.

4.7. Documentation. For the purpose of an audit trail of the CIP account, the project construction agent
and/or the sponsoring entity must retain the supporting documentation for their respective portion of the
project that they have fiscal accountability for. For an accepted RP asset, and for the purpose of an audit
trail, the project construction agent and/or the sponsoring entity must provide to the RPAO the list of aud-
itable supporting documentation that must be provided, along with their location, which in turn must
ensure the documentation is retained in accordance with applicable laws, regulations and instructions.

4.8. Accepting Construction in Foreign Countries. The host nation usually accomplishes the acquisi-
tion or construction of facilities, rather than a U.S. construction agent. When the facility is placed in ser-
vice, the data and background material furnished by the host nation may be accepted in lieu of the Interim
DD Form 1354 or other estimate. The REO will adjust the estimated capitalized amount in the RPI to
reflect the actual total construction costs when final documents are provided.

4.9. Accepting new Family Housing and Improvements.
     4.9.1. A single facility on a work order or with a project number that covers several facilities may be
     accepted as completed and capitalized on an ‘interim’ DD Form 1354. See UFC 1-300-08 and the
     CIPR (www.acq.osd.mil/ie/bei/CIP). Multiple housing units on one work order can be accepted and
     acceptance staggered over more than one year. See RPIR for RPUID requirements.
     4.9.2. When government-owned family housing and support facilities are maintained by contract, the
     contractor must provide adequate data (as determined by the AF) and documentation for the RPI for
     any improvement work accomplished that meets the capitalization threshold. If construction is to be
     accepted in phases, ensure the CIP Phase Indicator data element is populated in ACES.

4.10. Accepting Real Property Acquired By Government Purchase Card. For purchases of property
that could be considered RP or Real Property Installed Equipment (RPIE), use an AF Form 332, BCE
Work Order Request, to obtain BCE coordination and approval prior to purchase. If approval has not been
given in writing in advance, the property shall be treated as unit-owned equipment. If unit funds are used
to purchase items considered to be RPIE, unit funds should sustain and replace the equipment. The prop-
erty may be transferred after the fact on a DD Form 1354, if accepted by the BCE. See Sustainment of
RPIE, Attachment 2.

4.11. Reporting “Value” of CIP. Under the CFOA, an incomplete facility is still an asset to be reported
on the financial statement of the funding (or sponsoring) agency. If directly funded by Congress, the CIP
is under the total custody and control of the AF construction agent and will be reported directly to DFAS
by the construction agent or designated representative (i.e., contracting office). The CIP account must be
reported by the installation if the funding was under MAJCOM or base control and assigned a Military
Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) (DD Form 448). Costs will be collected and reported by the
installation civil engineer organization for locally-controlled construction projects. At least one RPUID
must be established at the creation of the CIP account. CIP must be tracked by the project number and
AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008                                                                                 19


associated with the Real Property Unique Identifier(s). For a construction project, the same project num-
ber must be used for all phases to enable proper identification of costs.
   4.11.1. The minimum information associated with CIP amount reported for financial statement prep-
   aration purposes must include the Customer Project Number, Project Detail Fund Code(s), Project
   Detail Cost, Project Detail Organization Code(s), Programmed Amount, and Real Property Unique
   Identifier(s).
   4.11.2. Ensure a unique, non-intelligent Real Property Site Unique Identifier (RPSUID) from the
   DoD RPSUID Registry is assigned to all RP sites in accordance with guidance in the RPIR and A7CA
   guidance. See Attachment 9. Note that “non-intelligent” data elements, such as the RPSUID, contain
   no embedded information or smart codes.
   4.11.3. Ensure a unique non-intelligent RPUID from the DoD RPUID Registry is assigned to all RP
   assets in accordance with HQ/A7CA guidance. See Attachment 9.

4.12. Reporting Cost Shared Projects. For each cost-shared project between Federal and Non-federal
entities, a CIP account must only be created if the asset is federally owned. For each cost-shared project
between Federal and Non-federal entities where the Federal Government is the construction agent, a work
In progress (WIP) account must be created if the asset is not federally owned. For each cost-shared project
between Federal and Non-federal entities where the asset’s final ownership was not determined at project
design, project design cost must be relieved from the CIP account and expensed to the general ledger
when it is determined that the asset will not be federally owned. Only the Federal share of construction
costs for RP being constructed on federal property in conjunction with a non-federal project (e.g. state or
other entity) should be captured in a CIP account. For each cost-shared project between Federal and
Non-federal entities when the asset is constructed on a federal property, the asset is recorded at its full
value in the RPI record. Only the DoD share of construction costs for RP being constructed on DoD prop-
erty in conjunction with another federal agency (e.g. Department of State) should be captured in a CIP
account on DoD’s financial statements. For each cost-shared project between Federal and Non-federal
entities where the Federal Government is not the construction agent and the asset is not federally owned,
the Federal Government share of construction cost must be expensed, as incurred.

Section 4C—Accounting for AF Presence on Non-AF Property (Ingrants)

4.13. Establish Inventory Records. The REO establishes AF inventory records for portions of installa-
tions (or detached leased facilities) that the AF does not own but acquires for its own use by lease, permit,
easement, license, or other written legal instrument. These records show the nature of the AF ‘interest’
and are identified in the AF Financial Statement and RPI record as being ‘leased’. This entry includes
both operating and capital leases.
   4.13.1. The REO will maintain data in the RPI on the terms and other specific legal characteristics of
   each instrument in accordance with established DoD and AF policy.
   4.13.2. Environmental contamination and cleanup require linkage of a facility number and RPUID to
   RP located both on and off the host installation.
       4.13.2.1. Access to property for which AF has no other interest may be accepted into the RPI for
       environmental remediation purposes. The interest will be minimal and shall be documented with a
20                                                                          AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008


        Right of Entry or other license. The property shall be given a facility number and a category code
        of 941101 while inactive and 933364 when under active remediation.
        4.13.2.2. Use latest published Category Codes for appropriate code citation for sites that are unre-
        mediated and use appropriate category code when active cleanup is underway. Ensure a license
        has been issued to support cleanup, if the AF has no other interest in the property.
     4.13.3. Lease interest for property owned by a non-government entity shall be accepted into the RPI
     within 30 days of Placed in Service Date and data elements populated to ensure accurate business
     management, reporting, and accountability. Leases originally signed with acquisition projects will be
     transferred to traditional documents in accordance with DFARS 252.245-7001 at renewal. Occupancy
     Agreements for property leased from GSA are not listed in the RPI at the present time. See AFI
     32-9003 Temporary Use of Real Property.
     4.13.4. AF facilities constructed on Army or Navy installations shall be transferred at acceptance, for
     accountability purposes, to the host Component and identified with the host installation facility num-
     ber, installation code, and installation name. Improvements made by the AF to these facilities will be
     timely reported to the host installation RPAO with a DD Form 1354) and sufficient supporting docu-
     mentation to provide auditability of the transaction. The AF will continue to submit Program Objec-
     tive Memoranda (POM) for sustainment, restoration and modernization for these facilities although
     they will no longer be reported to OSD and GSA as “owned’ by the AF. AF will continue to report
     them on the financial statement as ‘used’ by AF for mission purposes.

Section 4D—Administrative Accountability for Non-AF Presence on AF Installations

4.14. Beneficial Occupancy. DoD agencies may fund and maintain sole beneficial occupancy and use of
a facility on AF property for business purposes. Although the facility is carried on the host AF installa-
tion’s RPI for accountability, it is not reported as used by the AF for CFOA and AF financial statements.
     4.14.1. Require a complete DD Form 1354 from the transferring entity and record the property as
     ‘owned’ by the AF for physical accountability purposes only. Ensure appropriate cost, funding and
     organizational codes are correctly entered to ensure sustainment, restoration and modernization fund-
     ing is earned by the responsible service/entity. Proper coding will ensure that ACES-RP does not
     report costs associated with these properties on the AF financial statements.
     4.14.2. Require a copy of the signature page of contract documentation at project completion from the
     tenant or funding sponsor to support an audit trail of the final costs paid for the facilities, in addition
     to the DD Form 1354. Ensure support agreements are in place and properly recorded codes are entered
     in ACES.
     4.14.3. Provide a physical or scanned copy of the Interim and Final DD Form 1354 to the funding
     sponsor within ten (10) days of acceptance of the facility for all facilities funded by other than the
     Active AF Component.

Section 4E—Accounting for Non-AF presence on AF Bases (Preponderance of Use)

4.15. Preponderant Use. This is a calculated characteristic based on the percentage of the facility occu-
pied by the tenant. The occupant of 51% (or the largest share, if more than two tenants) of a General Fund
facility reports the asset on its financial statement.
AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008                                                                                21


   4.15.1. Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) Statement of Federal Financial
   Accounting Standards (SFFAS) No. 4, Managerial Cost Accounting Standards and Concepts, July
   1995, requires reporting entities to measure and report the full cost of their outputs (products and ser-
   vices) in general purpose financial reports. For real property, full costs should include products and
   services received by the reporting entity from a providing entity that is part of the same Department or
   a larger reporting entity. Products and services would include facility acquisition, operation, sustain-
   ment, and recapitalization costs.
   4.15.2. The federal standard differs from current Defense policy (e.g., DoD FMR Volume 4, Chapter
   6, Paragraph 060105B), which pre-dates the federal standard and requires the preponderant user of an
   asset to report the asset and associated costs. Until the difference in the accounting standard and
   Defense policy is resolved, continue to determine the preponderant use based on the Defense policy.
   4.15.3. A Working Capital Fund (WCF) entity shall report all RP occupied, regardless of percentage,
   on its financial statement. WCF entities shall reconcile occupancy data annually in accordance with
   DODI 4165.70.
   4.15.4. Tri Care Management Activity (TMA) is not a WCF, but has unique issues with funding that
   also require identification of preponderant (and all other) use of RP assets. Therefore, AF and TMA
   will annually reconcile appropriate data elements to ensure that both the physical and the financial
   records are correct. See DODFMR Volume 4, Chapter 6, Annex 1.
   4.15.5. Real property for non-US military activities (usually training) is reported as ‘owned by the
   AF’ for physical accountability purposes only. Ensure the appropriate cost, fund and organizational
   codes are correctly entered for sustainment, restoration and modernization and the REO has auditable
   information in the facility file to support the acquisition costs. Provide a physical or scanned Interim
   and/or Final DD Form 1354 to the funding sponsor within ten (10) days of Date Placed in Service, if
   funded by other than the Active AF Component.
   4.15.6. Real Property provided to contractors directly, is governed by Defense Federal Acquisition
   Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 252.245-7001 under a change that requires contractors to electroni-
   cally report information to the host base (in ACES RP) in accordance with the current Federal Acqui-
   sition Regulation (FAR), DFARS and DoD Instructions. The contractor will create and maintain
   records of all government RP accountable to the contract, including government-furnished and con-
   tractor-acquired or -operated property. The contractor shall periodically perform, record, and disclose
   physical inventory results at the request of the AF.
   4.15.7. Facilities sold without the underlying land are no longer ‘RP.’ Authority to demolish family
   housing under the above circumstances is within the purview of HQ AF/A7CA. See AFI 32-6001,
   Family Housing Management.
   4.15.8. Other privately-owned RP must also be properly accounted in accordance with the RPIR (see
   Attachment 9, RPIR Primer). Written agreements, i.e., municipal airport joint-use agreements may
   provide no “interest” in the RP but impose an obligation to pay a share of sustainment, restoration and
   modernization. That often requires AF programming for funding and other activities similar to those
   required for owned RP. Provide a facility number for the RP and use Interest Code 9 (privately owned
   and operated) or Interest Code 8 (owned by state or municipal government) for the property in
   non-reporting records to document necessary RP obligations against established records.

Section 4F—Accounting for Real Property Installed Equipment (RPIE)
22                                                                       AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008


4.16. RPIE Definition. RPIE is permanently attached RP generally installed as a part of a construction
project, that cannot be removed from the structure without physically damaging the structure and without
which the facility (structure) would be unable to operate as designed. When RPIE is changed (updated,
replaced, fixed), the appropriate ACES record should be updated to reflect the new capacity and date of
installation. See Attachment 2.

4.17. RPIE Sustainment. Real Property assets generate sustainment funding through models overseen
by the DUSD (I&E) and in accordance with the DODD Unified Facilities Pricing (UFC 3-701-04) Guide.
These models use the RPI to develop programmatic goals that underpin facilities’ plant replacement value
(PRV). A facility component must qualify as RPIE before it is considered for inclusion in the models. A
tri-service facility sustainment working group reviews all requirements periodically to add cost factors of
new RPIE components to the model. Unless approved for inclusion, the component will not earn sustain-
ment funding for the equipment. Therefore, life cycle costs associated with non-RPIE components cannot
be funded from these accounts. The using organization is responsible to budget and fund the acquisition,
maintenance, repair, and replacement of non-RPIE items.

4.18. Non-RPIE. Property or equipment that is easily removed without physical damage to the facility
(or not essential to its function) is not classified as RPIE and is not capitalized and recorded in the RPI;
i.e., automatic teller machines, automatic fryers, trademarked signage, etc. When moving non-RPIE, the
“owner” must restore the public structure or land to which the equipment was affixed to its original exist-
ing condition at installation. Exceptions are central plants that provide general heating, air conditioning,
dehumidification, and similar services for a facility through a system of connecting ducts or distribution
lines. Title for such plants, when installed, must be transferred to, and remain with, the government.
Deduct the cost of all non-RPIE equipment from the DD Form 1354 or BCE work order when capitalizing
costs in RP records. See Attachment 2.

4.19. RPIE Maintained by Contractors. In rare instances, the activity or contractor may retain
accountability (and fiscal responsibility) for installed property (i.e., an HVAC system with a 20-year ser-
vice contract). AF and the requesting activity will execute a license or memorandum of understanding to
the contractor to enable him or her to perform the required maintenance and have access to the equipment.
The BCE will not fund maintenance of the equipment because the contractor is or has been paid and it
does not generate sustainment funding otherwise.

4.20. RPIE in Foreign Countries. Title to all U.S. Government-constructed facilities plus any installed
equipment in foreign countries remains U.S. Government property, unless agreements state otherwise.
Record only the following in the Inventory: (a) Direct expenditures by military departments from DoD
construction and capital improvements appropriations, and (b) Direct investments of U.S. dollars (NAF or
donations).

Section 4G—Accounting for Real Property in Foreign Countries

4.21. Property in Foreign Countries. Very little land is owned by the AF in foreign countries. The Sta-
tus of Forces Agreement (SOFA) and/or Host Nation (or Country) Agreement signed by the State Depart-
ment and the counterpart organization in the subject country stipulates the terms by which facilities will
be built, occupied, leased, and improved. It also may identify the residual value, if any, to be recouped
when DoD no longer needs the property. Funding for sustainment, restoration and modernization must be

          MANAGEMENT OF THE AIR FORCE REAL PROPERTY INVENTORY (RPI)

Section 5A—Installation Real Property Inventories and Reports

5.1. Introduction. DODI 4165.14 and 4165.70 require periodic physical inventories to ensure that the
Military Department RPI is accurate, complete, and up-to-date. This includes physical inspections to
ensure, among other things, that installation RP facilities exist and are correctly recorded with complete
supporting electronic or paper documentation on file (audit trail). Include these inventory control catego-
ries: Single Purpose Facility (Control Code A); Multipurpose Facility (Control Code B); Land (Control
Code C); Individual Record within a ‘B’ Line Item (Control Code D); Miscellaneous Infrastructure (Con-
trol Code E); and Utility, Systems, and Plants and RPIE (Control Code X).

5.2. Designation Assignment. Copies of designation authority for RPAO(s) will be furnished to: the
employee assigned (RPAO/REO), the financial management office responsible for maintaining general
ledger control accounts of the property, and the MAJCOM RP staff.

5.3. Inventory Schedule. Each installation REO shall:
     5.3.1. Create and implement an inventory schedule that will achieve 100% coverage of the installa-
     tion’s RP holdings, with the exception of facilities that are recorded in aggregate and those that are not
     in use, excess or due for demolition, within the period identified by the MAJCOM, but not to exceed
     five years. Schedule the inventory of heritage assets (those properties that are unique for historical,
     architectural, cultural, educational, archeological, artistic, or natural significance) with the Cultural
     Resources Manager to ensure each is inventoried no later than every 3 years.
     5.3.2. Ensure there is wide and proper distribution of the inventory schedule to all entities who will be
     involved in data collection and verification.

5.4. Inventory Records. Installation RPAO/REO shall:
     5.4.1. Maintain records in accordance with AFMAN 33-363 which outlines the principles of applying
     electronic records (e-records) management (ERM) by using existing resources and prepares your
     organization for transition to an Enterprise Information Management (EIM) tool suite. See Attach-
     ment 6, Supporting Documentation.
     5.4.2. Retain records of inspections and inventories in the facility folder in the installation real estate
     office for audit purposes.
     5.4.3. Substantiate each record change with a supporting document. See Attachment 5
     5.4.4. Review current facility documentation and last recorded inventory data prior to conducting the
     next physical inventory. Note any construction or demolition activity since the last survey.
     5.4.5. Make corrections and update records as required. Identify date of next scheduled inventory in
     the Asset Review Date field.
     5.4.6. Report any scheduled inventories not accomplished within the 3- or 5-year window at end of
     year and percentage of scheduled inventories actually performed.
AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008                                                                               25


5.5. Assistance in Conducting Inventories. The BCE may require that other installation personnel
inventory selected facilities in the performance of their functional requirements. Suitable functions
include:
   5.5.1. Base housing office inventories and inspections of housing assets/facilities and associated
   RPIE.
   5.5.2. Services organization inventories of Services and Non Appropriated Fund (NAF) facilities.
   5.5.3. Facility managers’ inventories of assigned facilities.
   5.5.4. Environmental Flight inventories of landfills and tanks.
   5.5.5. Inspections of Outgranted and Ingranted facilities at the beginning and end of the term of each
   instrument.
   5.5.6. Using organizations’ inventories of ranges, range supporting structures and other assigned
   facilities.
   5.5.7. Cultural resource inspections of heritage assets.
   5.5.8. Tri-annual airfield inspection reports and reconciliations performed under contract with the Air
   Force Center for Engineering and Environment (AFCEE).
   5.5.9. Operations flight inventories of RPIE during their annual inspections of the equipment.

5.6. Inventory Worksheet. The REO will provide an inventory worksheet to anyone conducting an
inventory outside of the Real Estate Office. The worksheet will include basic facility data i.e.; facility
number, category code with description, square footage, etc, and a floor plan of the currently assigned
space, if available. The completed worksheet and updated floor plan will be returned to the REO for use
as supporting documentation to update the records. The REO/RPAO will ensure that the data recorded in
ACES is current and matches the information noted on the inventory worksheet. See Attachment 5.

5.7. Inventory Status Reports. DoD requires reports on the annual accomplishment of installation RP
periodic inventories. MAJCOMs will report to A7CAI at the end of each fiscal year the percentage of
scheduled inventories accomplished and the number of facilities at installations under their control having
exceeded the five-year limit without an inventory, as an electronic addendum to annual submission of data
to HQ AF/A7CAI.

5.8. Historic Preservation Inventories and Reports. The historic properties identified in the RPI
require inventories at least every three years and ongoing accurate reporting to several sources. The
USAF A7CV Cultural Resource Manager will reconcile the end-of-year ACES report of cultural resource
numbers and coding and advise A7CAI and the associated MAJCOMs by 31 March of the following year
of any discrepancies and their resolution to ensure the RPI is kept accurate, up-to-date, and remains
authoritative for Congressional reporting.

5.9. Installation Boundary Inspections. The REO shall accomplish the following:
   5.9.1. Boundary inspections shall be performed annually to ensure that any encroachments onto the
   base boundary are resolved by removal, if practical, or preparing an appropriate real estate instrument
   in accordance with AFI 32-9001, Acquisition of Real Property or AFI 32-9003 Temporary Use of
   Real Property.
26                                                                         AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008


     5.9.2. Boundary inspections may be ‘virtual’ rather than physical with BCE concurrence if data is no
     more than one year old, and when photographs, imagery, and information about activities contiguous
     with the base boundaries are sufficient to mitigate the risk of not ‘walking’ the boundary. Other
     cost-advantageous methods may also be employed to meet this requirement, such as flying and photo-
     graphing, in lieu of walking or driving boundaries.
     5.9.3. Acquisition tracts (assemblage deeds) have been added to the RPI as assets under RPIR imple-
     mentation for the DoD Asset Registry. These tracts do not require additional inventory activity if there
     are no disputes or issues involved. Rather, the inspections of the exterior sides of boundary tracts that
     compose the installation boundary are included with the annual boundary inspection. Note any dis-
     crepancies found in the imaging to the BCE for later validation.
     5.9.4. Update the RP record with the date the installation boundary inspection was completed and
     document the findings with a memo for the record (MFR). Documentation of both the inspection and
     approval of the BCE are required for an audit trail. The survey MFR can be signed by the RPAO or
     other designed representative. If encroachments are identified, the BCE will request action in rectify-
     ing issues from USACE or NAVFAC.
     5.9.5. Offices, warehouse, hospitals, laboratories, and family housing also require periodic utilization
     reviews for the annual FRPC report. See Guidance for End of Year Reporting to GSA for the FRPP at
     GSA.gov.

5.10. Establishment of Real Property Record Files. Real Property record files will be established
maintained and retained in accordance with AFRIMS Records Disposition Schedule Section 32. Copies of
all documents pertaining to real estate transactions, i.e., acquisition, disposal, leases, permits, will be
included in the files. The RPO shall have access to supporting documents such as maps, plans, blueprints,
drawings, specifications, and other documents that relate to the RPI files and serve as subsidiary records
to the general ledger control account, when required. Close coordination between the fiscal or financial
management office and the REO is essential to ensure that records and accounts remain in balance. In
accordance with DODFMR 7000.14-R, Chapter 6, Volume 4, balances for capitalized RP will be recon-
ciled with the financial accounts at least semi-annually.

Section 5B—Real Property Records Maintenance

5.11. Introduction. All involved in RPI data management ensure audit trails exist to source documenta-
tion; risk mitigation plans ensure there is no potential for fraud; and processing of DD Form 1354s, work
orders, project close out, and other events are timely, accurate, and apply appropriate accountability
requirements. Future allocation of funds from OSD is based on the data in the RPI.
     5.11.1. For a specified project, and for the purpose of an audit trail of the CIP account, the govern-
     ment’s project construction agent and/or the sponsoring entity must retain the supporting documenta-
     tion for their respective portion of the project that they have fiscal accountability for.
     5.11.2. For an accepted RP asset, and for the purpose of an audit trail, the government’s project con-
     struction agent and/or the sponsoring entity must provide to the RPAO the list of auditable supporting
     documentation that must be provided, along with their location, which in turn must ensure the docu-
     mentation is retained in accordance with applicable laws, regulations and instructions.
AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008                                                                                    27


   5.11.3. Real Property record files will be kept continuously up-to-date by posting changes as they
   occur and by incorporating supporting documentation in the files at the same time.

5.12. Real Property Financial Reconciliation.
   5.12.1. Real property source documents must be reconciled to records in ACES and also reconciled
   with the general ledger records in AF accounting systems: i.e. but not limited to, the General Account-
   ing and Finance System (GAFS).
   5.12.2. The financial reconciliation process should be completed at least semi-annually (preferred
   quarterly) to ensure that any RP additions, corrections, or disposals are accurately captured in ACES
   and the accounting systems. The BCE is responsible for ensuring the accuracy and timely reconcilia-
   tion of records. Responsible offices will review ACES reports to verify and certify that all assets are
   entered correctly in ACES and are supported by hardcopy or other source documentation.
   5.12.3. The BCE will ensure an annual RPI reconciliation is accomplished by a multi-discipline
   group consisting mainly of resource managers; RPAOs; tenants; and other offices/organizations as
   required such as operations/program managers.
   5.12.4. Upon completion of an inspection, the BCE, RPAO or designated representative will prepare
   and certify a detailed RP inventory list.

5.13. Real Property Inventory Physical Reconciliation with Defense Agencies and AFWCF. I n
accordance with DODI 4165.14, tenants, DoD components and WCF facility users shall:
   5.13.1. Maintain accurate and current information about those RP facilities in which they are the sole
   user or over which they exercise management responsibility and provide this data annually to the mil-
   itary department exercising RP accountability for the facility.
   5.13.2. Provide inventory and other information requested by the AF to assist in managing the RP
   used by the DoD components.
   5.13.3. Per applicable policy, procedures, and guidance, reimburse the costs incurred by the AF in
   managing the RP used by the DoD component.
   5.13.4. Except as noted otherwise, provided by law, or differently in this or other DoD publications,
   pay all costs, whether direct or indirect, resulting from use of AF RP facilities. Such costs include,
   without limitation, maintenance, repair, construction, environmental compliance, environmental res-
   toration, historic and cultural preservation, security, fire protection, utilities, and demolitions/disposal.
   5.13.5. REOs will ensure that property the AF ‘holds’ for defense agencies cites is coded 5, Out-
   granted permit for property ‘owned’ by DoD.
   5.13.6. REOs will annually provide tenants with copies of their portion of the Inventory Detail Report
   by 31 Mar with mutual adjudication procedures and resolution for any discrepancies to be completed
   by 30 July.
   5.13.7. The following diagram summarizes necessary actions and completion dates.
28                                                                      AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008


Figure 5.1. Reconciliation Time Line




Section 5C—Accounting for Changes to Original Design Category Code Use

5.14. Changes in Use Based on RPIR. The RPIR now requires tracking changes in the category code of
a facility from construction throughout its useful life. Approval of a conversion project under AFI
32-1021, Planning and Programming Military Construction (MILCON) Projects, or approval of a waiver
or exception to criteria under AFI 32-1024, Standard Facility Requirements, automatically includes
approval of the conversion or change in use. AFH 32-1084, Facility Requirements, provides standards,
references, and technical guidance to assist in determining the details for waiver requests. The REO shall
be notified to change the RPI or that the RPI has been changed by the data owner.

5.15. Criteria for Changes in Use of Facilities. All changes in use of facilities must be consistent with
the base planning documents. Note. There is no requirement to report change in use (i.e., FAC/CAC) for
BRAC property.

5.16. Procedures for Requesting a Change in Use, The REO presents the proposed change in use to
appropriate authorities or other approval processes as directed by the Installation Commander. The REO
will ensure the approval or disapproval is appropriately documented. Installation commanders approve all
changes in use except the following. Request changes as shown below and send a copy of the request for
change in use to the MAJCOM A7C Real Estate office.
     5.16.1. Munitions and Maintenance Facilities. To request changes in use of munitions storage and
     maintenance facilities that would reduce clear-zone citing for weapons or munitions and support
     items, forward AF Form 123, Request for Changed Use of Real Property, through these channels:
        5.16.1.1. For permanent changes, forward through MAJCOM munitions and safety offices to the
        HQ USAF functional office.
        5.16.1.2. For temporary changes of up to one year, forward to MAJCOM munitions and safety
        offices.
     5.16.2. Family Housing. Facilities cannot be converted to family housing without statutory authoriza-
     tion, unless they originally were constructed or acquired as family housing. To convert or change the
     use from family housing, send an AF Form 123 through the MAJCOM housing office to HQ AF/
     A7CAH. See AFI 32-6001 for specific requirements related to conversion of family housing.
        5.16.2.1. Changes in use of family housing for more than three years are considered permanent.
        5.16.2.2. If the use will not exceed three years and the unit is not surplus, request diversion or
        temporary change in use through the MAJCOM. If approved, keep the unit on the RP records as
        family housing. See AFI 32-6001 for specific requirements related to diversion.
AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008                                                                                29


   5.16.3. Dormitories. To request a conversion or a change in the use, forward AF Form 123 through
   the MAJCOM housing office to HQ AF/A7CAH.
   5.16.4. New Facilities. Do not change the use that was justified on DD Form 1391 within the first two
   years after project completion and placement into service. However, if a change in use is necessary
   because of base mission or other overriding needs, send AF Form 123 through the MAJCOM CE pro-
   gramming office to HQ AF/A7CA (or ANGRC/CEPR for ANG facilities) for approval and congres-
   sional notification.
   5.16.5. Services Facilities. For recreation centers or facilities generally constructed or purchased with
   non-appropriated funds, forward AF Form 123 through MAJCOM services to HQ AF/A4V, if the
   requested change in use does not directly support an MWR purpose.
   5.16.6. Religious Facilities. To request change of a use for religious facilities, send AF Form 123
   through the MAJCOM Chaplain to HQ AF Chaplain Service.
   5.16.7. USAFE only. To change use of NATO infrastructure submit AF Form 123 to USAFE/A7P.
   5.16.8. Medical Facilities. Forward AF Form 123 through the MAJCOM Office of the Command
   Surgeon to HQ AF/SG.

Section 5D—Requesting a New Facility Analysis Category Code (FAC) or AF Category Code

5.17. Category and FAC Codes. Category codes are identified and maintained in concert with OSD
FAC codes. New codes or changes in current codes require significant coordination with OSD, Air Staff,
and Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency (AFCESA). Not all facilities or category codes have sus-
tainment funding requirements (i.e., hush houses and test stands.)
   5.17.1. If the BCE believes particular equipment to be subject to sustainment funding but not
   included in the current sustainment models, submit the following information through the MAJCOM
   to HQ AF/A7CAI to initiate the review process:
       5.17.1.1. A thorough description of the facility and why no available category code is applicable,
       including a justification for need of a specific code.
       5.17.1.2. Photographs, data, and technical specifications, if available.
       5.17.1.3. A clear definition of the proposed category code and link to the FAC code, either exist-
       ing or proposed.
       5.17.1.4. Unit(s) of measure that conform(s) to the FAC Units of Measure. [AF Data Dictionary
       UM-001]
       5.17.1.5. Proposed new category code nomenclature.
   5.17.2. A request for a new category code will be reviewed against existing codes and criteria to
   determine if it meets any of the current guidelines for sustainment funding. If there are any questions,
   AF/A7CAI will provide background information to the Tri-Service Facility Working Group for a
   decision as to whether the equipment can be funded for sustainment by A7C through a category code
   and the sustainment model.
   5.17.3. Newly established category and FAC codes will be reviewed by AFCESA for costs and addi-
   tion to ACES and provided to MAJCOMs for their information by August 30.
30                                                                         AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008


Section 5E—Accounting for Changes in Installations Characteristics

5.18. Installation Types. Installations are a management concept for RP in which the AF has an interest
or jurisdiction and for which the AF is accountable to the Office of Management and Budget. Installation
definition also includes RP that the AF controls by agreement with foreign governments or through other
rights. For RP accountability and reporting, designate an installation as one of the following types:
     5.18.1. Primary installation. A self-supporting installation, with or without an aircraft operating area
     that has facilities for administrative and operating activities to carry out a given mission. For record-
     ing and reporting RP, this is normally the parent or control installation.
     5.18.2. Auxiliary installation. An installation with an aircraft operating area that provides operational
     activities in support of a primary installation and depends upon a primary installation for administra-
     tive and logistical support.
     5.18.3. Off base installation. An installation without an aircraft operating area that provides opera-
     tional, training, administrative, or logistical support to a primary, auxiliary, or detached installation
     and depends on that installation for other support. An installation that is separated only by a road,
     fence or other segregating construction is not considered an off base installation (but is considered
     another site under RPIR).
     5.18.4. Detached installation. A non self-supporting installation used for administrative, operational,
     or training missions not in support of any particular primary, auxiliary, or off base installation.
     5.18.5. Detached leased installation. A non self-supporting installation with a leasehold interest in the
     entire installation, used for administrative, operational, or training missions not in support of any par-
     ticular primary, auxiliary, or off-base installation.

Section 5F—Documentation to support an audit trail for the Installation

5.19. Documentation Requirements. Each REO has a variety of paper, plans, and electronic files docu-
menting the evolution of the installation. ACES holds the official records for RP accountability. However,
the ‘historical’ paper files often provide information not captured in a database to solve problems relating
to past events. These documents may be required to provide an audit trail for existence, completeness, and
valuation of property data in the official records and should be retained in accordance with the require-
ments set by the National Archives and Records Agency and AF records retention policy. Real property
records are usually kept at the primary installation with the exception of some original acquisition docu-
ments maintained by the USACE or NAVFAC. When this is not practicable, the MAJCOM will assign
this responsibility to the nearest AF installation having the capability. See Attachment 4.
AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008                                                                                31


                                                Chapter 6

                     ACCOUNTING FOR DISPOSAL OF REAL PROPERTY

Section 6A—Accounting for Disposal of Privately-Owned and Operated Real Property

6.1. Privatized Housing and Utility Systems.
   6.1.1. Sale of housing or utilities completes AF accountability requirements when AF interest is con-
   veyed for both the land and the facilities, and the records are archived from the active RPI.
       6.1.1.1. Land contiguous to the installation on which family housing is sold is generally leased to
       the developer for a long term and kept active in the RPI. Land separated from the installation and
       excess to its needs is generally sold to the developer with the improvements on it and archived
       from the active RPI.
       6.1.1.2. Disposal of the land with or without improvements will generally include portions of
       roads, fences, and other assets accounted for in aggregate records. Delete those portions of sold
       RP from the RPI aggregated records at time of sale.
   6.1.2. Transfer data on the sold property, as of the date of sale and lease, to non-reportable Z records
   for future reports. The interest code for the transferred facilities is ‘Privately Owned and Operated.”
   Current data on these no-longer-owned assets may be available from the Housing Office or the project
   manager at AFCEE. The REO has no regulatory requirement to update records of no-longer owned
   RP. Complete the transaction and modify the RPI within the same month as the disposal documents
   are signed.
   6.1.3. Utility systems are generally sold by Bill of Sale and have no other RP attributes. Provide a
   license or easement for the new owner to access and service the on-base equipment. Ensure the aggre-
   gate records are adjusted to accurately reflect what was sold and what is still owned for the audit trail
   and future funding.

6.2. Retention and Disposal of Records. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)
provides the guidance for retention of RP records and AF AFRIMS Records Disposition Schedule identi-
fies the appropriate retention periods. AF File Plans must reflect these legally-required retention sched-
ules in accordance with AFMAN 33-363.

6.3. Accounting for Demolition of Facilities. Record expected sales or salvage values less any costs
necessary to prepare the facilities for disposal through sale, trade, or donation. Do not disclose costs of
deferred maintenance. Facilities disposed by demolition have no net sales or salvage value but do have
associated costs that must be accrued and reported in accordance with Statements of Federal Financial
Accounting Standards (SFFAS) No. 6. The two key criteria for a reportable liability are that a future cost
is probable and that the cost can be estimated.

Figure 6.1. Disposal Timeline




6.4. Accounting for Environmental Liabilities.
     6.4.1. Environmental liabilities are recognized for probable and measurable future outflows or expen-
     diture of resources for environmental cleanup costs that result from past transactions or events. Envi-
     ronmental conditions that result from current operations and require immediate cleanup are not
     considered environmental liabilities and are a current operating expense. Some RP assets have associ-
     ated environmental liabilities.
        6.4.1.1. Environmental cleanup requirements are for restoration of contamination caused by prior
        AF operations relate to PP&E, including acquired land and Stewardship Land.
        6.4.1.2. Environmental closure requirements are for the future closure of certain facilities. Exam-
        ples include the future costs associated with closing a solid waste landfill, waste water treatment
        plant, fuel storage tanks, or permit requirements associated with treatment, storage and disposal
        facilities, open burn/ open detonation sites and asbestos.

Terms
Accountability—The obligation that a law or regulation imposes to keep accurate records of property,
documents and funds. The person with this obligation might or might not have actual possession of the
property, documents, or funds. Accountability applies primarily to records and control, while possession
of the asset and responsibility applies primarily to custody, care, and safekeeping.
ACES (Automated Civil Engineer System)—The current system used by civil engineering personnel to
account for and manage AF assets. ACES is the original ‘book of entry’ for financial accounting in terms
of original acquisition cost and cost of any major improvements over the statutory threshold under the
Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990.
Acquired Land—Land obtained from any private or public source. Land withdrawn from the public
domain is not considered acquired land.
Acquisition Cost to Government—The total amount(s) paid over time to acquire and improve the RP
asset. This is the sum of the Acquisition Original Asset Recorded Cost Amount plus all capital
improvement costs accumulated to the present time.
Acquisition Cost—The amount, net of both trade and cash discounts, paid for the property, plus any
ancillary costs.
Acquisition—The original use or control of RP or an interest in RP by purchase, condemnation, donation,
exchange, leasing, or recapture.
Activation—Establishing an AF function at a current AF installation or facility or the activation of a new
installation.
AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008                                                                                    39


AF Real Property Interest Code—A code that indicates the degree of AF ownership (interest) in land or
facilities.
Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Easement—An estate of ownership conveying to the
holder certain rights pertaining to aviation specified in an easement (e.g., the right to over fly lands, height
restrictions and noise generation) for the right to control the fee owners’ use of the surface, by prohibiting
uses which would result in aviation safety hazards (generation of smoke or dust, bird attraction ponds,
crops, or height obstructions.)
Amortization—Gradual reduction, redemption, or liquidation (paying off) of an account according to a
specified schedule of times and amounts.
Annexation—A procedure by which a city, town, or village incorporates AF land within the corporate
limits of the municipality. Procedures vary depending on state law.
Appraisal—Determining the value of an asset or liability in the market place at a particular time.
Area Amoun—t-The capacity or size of a facility (generally an outside measurement).
Asset—Anything having monetary value. A DoD asset is any item of economic value owned by a DoD
Component or held in a fiduciary capacity under the control of a DoD Component. The item may be
physical in nature (tangible) or a DoD Component may have a right to control the item (intangible). The
value of a DoD asset is expressed in terms of its acquisition cost and control of the asset by particular DoD
Component must be the result of a past transaction or event.
Auxiliary Installation—An installation with an aircraft-operating area that provides operational
activities in support of a primary installation and depends upon a primary installation for administrative
and logistical support.
Book Value—The recorded cost of a RP asset and capital improvements less its accumulated
depreciation.

activities.
Cadastral—A public record, survey, or map of the value, extent, and ownership of land as a basis of
taxation.
Capital Improvement—Acquisition or improvement to RP that increases the RP asset’s unit of measure,
efficiency, or useful life.
Capital Lease—A lease is classified as a capital lease if one of the following four criteria is met. 1. The
lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by, or at, the end of the lease term; 2. the lease
contains an option to purchase the leased property at a bargain price; 3. the lease term is equal to or greater
than 75 percent of the estimated economic life of the leased property; and 4. the present value of rental
and other minimum lease payments, excluding that portion representing executory costs to be paid by the
lessor, equals or exceeds 90 percent of the fair value of the leased property. All other leases are classified
as operating leases.

Category Code (CATCODE)—A six-digit numerical code that represents a specific type of facility
based on OSD Factor Analysis Codes.
Change in Use—Changing the assigned use of a facility or space from one category code to another.
Chief Financial Officers Act (CFOA)—All executive agencies, pursuant to the Chief Financial Officers
Act of 1990 and the Accountability for Tax Dollars Act of 2002 are required to prepare and submit
audited financial statements to OMB and the Congress. Recognizing that financial and performance
information in one document presents a more comprehensive and integrated picture of agency
performance, OMB expanded the authorization granted under the Reports Consolidation Act of 2000 to
require that agencies prepare a combined Performance and Accountability Report (PAR) each year.
Command Codes—Identifies recognized Military commands designated by the Secretary of the AF.
Common Use Space—Space within a building that is used by all occupants, i.e., a break room.
Condemnation—A judicial proceeding started by the government through the Department of Justice to

function. Has been replaced by the Facility Physical Quality (Q) Code under the RPIR.
Consideration—Compensation or an equivalent (such as money, material or services) that is given for
something acquired or promised.
Construction—Erect, install, assemble, alter, expand or replace a facility.
Construction-in-Progress (CIP) Account—This represents the accumulation of costs of construction
for or by the sponsoring entity since project inception. For constructed assets, all related costs to construct
the asset are captured in the “Construction-in-Progress” account until the asset is placed in service or the
beneficial occupancy date. Then all cost information is transferred from the Construction-in-Progress
account to the Real Property Asset account at the time the asset, or the capital improvement to the asset is
placed in service. Costs are documented on the DD Form 1354.
Contract—An enforceable agreement, including rental and lease agreements and purchase orders

Characteristics Report. Also signifies official orders to assign accountability responsibility.
Detached Installation—A non self-supporting installation used for administrative, operational, or
training missions not in support of any particular primary, auxiliary, or off base installation.
Detached Leased Installation—A non self-supporting installation with a leasehold interest in the entire
installation used for administrative, operational, or training missions not in support of any particular,
primary, auxiliary, or off-base installation.
Disposal—Any authorized method of permanently relinquishing AF control, accountability or
responsibility for RP.
AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008                                                                                41


Domain Governance Board (DGB)—The DGB oversees the development and implementation of the
DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA) for all RP, installation management and environmental
business areas under the purview of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Installations and
Environment).
Donation—Gift of personal or RP.
Easement—The legal right to use land of another for a specified purpose.
Enhanced-use Leasing—Expands the categories of consideration the AF can accept for property leased,
including construction of new facilities.
Estimated Useful Life Adjustment Quantity—The number of years by which the life of a RP facility is
extended through the completion of a capital improvement.
Estimated Useful Life—The total number of service years expected from a long-term RP facility. In
other words, the amount of time that the facility is expected to be in use.
Excess Real Property—AF RP that has been screened within the AF and is excess to further AF
requirements.
Facilities Board (FB)—The installation Facilities Board is the corporate decision-making body for real
estate and RP actions, chaired by the installation commander. All RP actions should have the support and
approval of the Facilities Board or similar committee. Also known as Facilities Utilization Board.
Facility Analysis Category—(FAC)-A four-digit numerical code that denotes the facility types within a
basic category. The FAC is the basis for an agency category code.
Facility Number—A unique ordinal number assigned to a facility.
Facility Physical Quality Code—The quality of the facility based on its physical condition and
configuration. Report facility “quality status” in four tiers modeled after the C-rating system used
throughout DoD and in the Installation Readiness Report (IRR). Facility Quality is a major quantifiable
element of overall facilities readiness, but is not the sole element. Another quantifiable element of
readiness is facility availability, measured by space deficit. The final element is a non-quantifiable
judgment of operational impact. In program and budget terminology, the quality rating is a function of a
facility’s restoration and modernization requirements.
Facility—A building, structure, or linear structure out to an imaginary line surrounding a facility at a
distance of five feet from the foundation that, barring specific direction to the contrary such as a utility
privatization agreement, denotes what is included in the basic record for the facility (e.g., landscaping,
sidewalks, utility connections). This imaginary line is what is commonly referred to as the “five-foot
line.”
Fair Market Value (Fair Value)—The fair market value is an unbiased, equitable, or just value based on
the cost of a similar asset or the price that an impartial buyer would be willing to pay for the asset or a
similar asset.
Fee Simple Title (Ownership)—Title to RP belonging to a person or the government where full and
unconditional ownership exists. Such ownership does not necessarily include mineral rights.
General Purpose Space—Space in buildings and associated land under the assignment authority of the
General Services Administration (GSA) that is suitable for use by federal agencies.
Geographic Location Code (GEOLOC)—See Installation Code.
42                                                                         AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008

Heritage Assets—Unique properties for historical, architectural, cultural, educational, archeological,
artistic, or natural significance. Heritage assets are generally expected to be preserved indefinitely.
Heritage assets are reported as required supplementary stewardship information accompanying the
financial statements. Heritage assets are to be reported in terms of physical units rather than cost, fair
value, or other monetary values. Multi-Use Heritage Assets are those that serve two purposes: (1) a
heritage function and (2) a government operations function.
Historic Asset—Historic properties, as defined by the National Historic Preservation Act, are those
properties listed on, or eligible for listing on, the National Register of Historic Places (National Register).
The National Register establishes specific criteria for the identification and evaluation of historic
properties (36 CFR 60.4).
Industrial Facility—Any AF-owned, -leased, or -controlled RP facility used for fulfilling government
research, development, test, evaluation, production, maintenance or modification contracts, or for the
storage of production machinery and equipment in support of such activity.
Ingrants—Actions initiated by the AF such as licenses, leases, permits, temporary easements, foreign
base rights agreements, and treaties, under which the AF acquires an interest in or control of RP in less
than fee ownership.
Installation Code—A code that identifies an installation and distinguishes one installation from another.
AF uses a four-digit alpha GEOLOC code for each site.
Installation—A base, camp, post, station, yard, center, or other activity, including leased facilities, under
the jurisdiction, custody, or control of the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of a Military Department
or, in the case of an activity in a foreign country, under the operational control of the Secretary of Defense
or the Secretary of a Military Department, without regard to the duration of operational control. An
installation may include one or more sites.

or Non Real Property.
Inventory Control Code—Identifies the type of facility.
Inventory—A physical inspection of facilities.
Lease Term—The specified period of time plus any renewal periods.
Lease—The contractual agreement between the owner (lessor) and user (lessee) for the exclusive use of
real or personal property.
Legal Description—A valid land description that unambiguously identifies only one location on the
ground, and describes boundaries accurately, briefly, clearly, and completely. A military base full
boundary survey may never have been ‘legally’ described, and some of the documents may not have been
recorded. DD Form 1354 often serves as the only ‘deed’ for transfer of property within DoD and is not
necessarily recorded at the county court house. Most base descriptions are comprised of one or more of
the following measurement methods:
Legal Description: Federal Township and Range—In public domain states, land was surveyed in the
Federal Township and Range System, not in Metes and Bounds.
Legal Description: Metes and Bounds—In southern states, land was surveyed in the indiscriminate
metes and bounds system. This survey system uses natural land features, such as trees and streams, as well
as neighboring landowners’ property, along with distances to describe plots of land. Frequently, the
description of the tract does not define a closed figure. There may be slight gaps or crossing where the end
and the beginning do not meet exactly.
Legal Description: Plats and Maps—A survey plat is more restrictive in scope than a map. It is a
surveyor’s diagram showing land boundaries and/or subdivision of land. It is a drawing that represents the
particular area included in a survey (such as a township, private land claim, or mineral claim) and the lines
surveyed, established, retraced, or resurveyed. The plat typically shows the direction and length of each of
the surveyed lines; the relationship to the adjoining official surveys; the boundaries, descriptions and area
of each parcel of land subdivided; and, insofar as is practicable, the relief and improvements within the
limits of the survey. A map, as contrasted with a plat, graphically represents to a scale the physical
features of an area and may show some general land boundaries, especially political and administrative
boundaries. The cadastral survey plat is the source document for people’s rights in lands on which all land
patents, descriptions and conveyances are based. A land survey is considered an official cadastral survey
when the survey has been accepted and the plat is filed with the appropriate land office.
44                                                                          AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008


Legal Description-Alternate—In the absence of a modern survey by a licensed surveyor that resulted in
an up-to-date recorded legal description, it is necessary to develop the best audit trail of property title from
what is available. The following are considered valid and viable deliverables for installation boundaries,
ranked from most preferred to least preferred:
Legal Description-Alternate-1 Resurveyed Boundary Report—A l i c e n s e d ( i n t h e s a m e s t a t e )
surveyor’s compilation of all available source material, supported by a field survey of each of the corners
of the base. Typically, this would result in a new ‘legal description’ that is more accurate, complete, and
capable of being verified through other technology.
Legal Description-Alternate-2 Resurveyed Plat—This is a current drawing of the surveyed property
showing all bearings and distances along boundaries describing what is found along each property line,
including fences and encroachments. Surveyed plats also typically state what type of monument is found
at the corners and whether this monument was ‘set’ or’ found. The surveyed plat should reflect the
findings of an actual field survey. The final report may contain a new legal description or merely list the
compilation of the parcels.
 Legal Description-Alternate-3 ALTA Survey—This document is signed and stamped by a surveyor
(licensed in the state) that accurately describes the parcel through a field survey that noted boundary
features such as fences, rivers, lakes, roads, etc., and presence or absence of a corner monument that was
either found or set. The result may be a recordable legal description but may also be only list the sources
used and the findings sited.
Legal Description-Alternate-4 Tract Map—An assemblage of all deeds and title search information
involving the installation/facility. Boundaries of the installation/facility are portrayed graphically with all
associated parcels clearly labeled. Typically prepared by or under the supervision of a licensed surveyor.
Final product is a more current legal description of each parcel that comprises the base with a list of
encumbrances, both recorded and unrecorded.
Legal Description-Alternate-5 Title Search Provided—A search of all legal instruments, typically
from state or county offices, which indicate ownership or ‘title’ to each relevant property. This includes,
but is not limited to, instruments such as deeds, mortgages, etc. Final product is a tract map, but may be
considerably less reliable when not performed by a licensed surveyor.
Legal Description-Alternate-6 Gathered Legal Description—A compilation of records found at the
installation/facility or at the local courthouse by someone other than a title agent. The supervision of this
process has some bearing on the merit of the documents. If the information is gathered under the
supervision of a licensed surveyor and is supported by an actual field survey, it is considered more valid.
If valid, this usually is the basis for a tract map of the base.
Legal Description-Alternate-7 Tax Maps and Plats—A collection of all drawings, maps and plats
showing evidence of the property boundaries. On an increasing frequency, tax maps and plats are
maintained by many counties as geo-referenced GIS data. This data is valid if based on acceptable
metadata. In some states, the plat is the legal base boundary, and a field survey may only be required for
the exterior boundary line.
Legal Description-Alternate-8 Digitized Notional Boundary—An electronic drawing, only loosely
based on coordinates showing the widely accepted boundaries of the property to the best of the ‘drafter’s’
ability.
License—Non-possessory interest in RP.

used for its designated functional purpose.
Off-Base Installation or Site—A physically-separated installation or site without an aircraft operating
area that provides operational, training, administrative, or logistical support to primary, auxiliary, or

and (3) have been acquired or constructed with the intention of being used, or being available for use by
the DoD. There are three PP&E categories: * General PP&E (including land acquired for or in connection
with other general PP&E). * heritage assets, and *stewardship land. General PP&E will be disclosed on
the financial statements in the General PP&E account when the cost of the asset exceeds the capitalization
threshold established for the DoD. General PP&E includes assets acquired through capital lease and land
acquired for or in connection with other general PP&E.
Preponderant Use—When there is more than one user of an asset, the user that has the greater
percentage of usage (e.g., square footage for RP) will be the preponderant user, in most situations.
Defense Agencies that possess and control (have preponderant use of ) PP&E assets that materially
contribute to the Defense Agencies’ mission should maintain accounting and financial reporting of such
PP&E, regardless of the organization that originally acquired the items or provided the funding for the
PP&E. If a Defense Agency prepares financial statements, such PP&E assets should be reported in its
financial statements.
Primary Installation—A self-supporting installation, with or without an aircraft operating area that has
facilities for administrative and operational activities to carry out a given mission. For recording and
reporting RP, this is normally the parent or host installation.
Programmed Installation—An installation for which the AF does not have RP jurisdiction, control, or
accountability but that an AF organization occupies or programs for use. The Joint Chiefs of Staff assign
such installations their programmed installation indicators.

into the facility as an integral part of the facility (such as heating systems), but not movable equipment
(e.g., plant equipment, industrial equipment, buoys). In many instances this term is synonymous with real
estate.
Relocatable Structure—A building or other structure designed for economical erection or relocation
from one site to another, such as temporary classrooms and office or storage buildings these are not RP.

3. Items which would normally be funded as construction and accounted for as RPIIE (construction pads,
foundations, supporting utilities, facilities, fences etc.) become RPIE regardless of initial fund source.
Maintenance, repair and replacement funding of all real property is the responsibility of the BCE.
Modification of the real property is funded as construction unless included as part of a subsequent
equipment modification/replacement program (e.g. sound suppression equipment replace) done as a
turn-key procurement in accordance with para 8.19, AFI 65-601 Vol 1.
4. The temporary facility-use (re-locatable) authority was a concession from Congress to provide DoD a
way to satisfy (for very short periods with unsubstantial buildings) requirements that were so urgent they
could not wait for normal processes to obtain construction. Over time, temporary structures were erected
that were more like permanent facilities than austere, relocatable structures. Current DoD and AF policy
is to keep temporary facilities to an absolute minimum; as short-term as possible, and only in use until the
permanent facility is built or the mission no longer requires their use. See AFI 32-1021 Chapter 6.

        INSTRUCTIONS FOR FACILITY PHYSICAL INSPECTION/INVENTORY FORM

A5.1. The facilities forecasting models (FSM, FMM, FOM, FIM, etc) use various data fields and factors
to generate future funding requirements (budget). Requirements are based on the actual RP inventory data
and other information so the necessity for accurate and reliable inventory data is essential.

A5.2. The following actions are suggested for validating physical inventory surveys:
     A5.2.1. Verify the physical presence of the facility being surveyed, i.e., does the facility exist and is
     this an accurate facility number?
     A5.2.2. Verify that the category code applicable to the facility reflects the current use. If the facility
     was converted to new use, has the category code been changed? Are there non-AF occupants in the
     facility, i.e., other DoD organizations, federal or state organizations and civilian contractors?
     A5.2.3. Ensure an accurate size/capacity. Ensure an accurate unit of measure is appropriately used.
     A5.2.4. Validate the ‘Construction Type’ (permanent, semi-permanent, or temporary, concrete pave-
     ments, bituminous pavement, stabilized pavement, other pavement, chemical and biological protected
     facility, hardened facility or hardened facility/biological facility). It is critical that all facilities that
     have been upgraded are documented and the upgrade reflected in the RPI.
     A5.2.5. Validate ownership of the building and ensure the correct ownership (Interest) code has been
     input into the Inventory.
     A5.2.6. If the facility is not listed as Facility Quality Code 1 (requiring minimal renovation to ade-
     quately perform its function) check to see if projects have been programmed to correct the deficien-
     cies.
     A5.2.7. Identify that facilities available for use are properly coded. Verify the amount of vacant space
     and its designation in the Inventory.
     A5.2.8. Ensure all new construction and capital improvements have been updated in ACES. If capi-
     talized with an Interim DD Form 1354 or an estimate, ensure that the work order has been closed and
     the Final DD Form 1354 received from the construction agent. Check recently capitalized property
     with design and construction lists to ensure none were missed.
     A5.2.9. Key items to verify to source documentation include:
     Fund code(s)
     Square Footage
     Bldg #
     FAC ID
     RP Interest Code
     Status of Historical facilities, inactive or closed facilities (e.g., landfills)
     Placed in Service

                                              Attachment 7

                   GENERAL REAL PROPERTY FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY

A7.1. General Ledger Accounting for RP is required by Public Law. The following three references are
most important in explaining the accounting guidelines:
     A7.1.1. Chief Financial Officers Act (CFO) of 1990.
     A7.1.2. Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) Statements of Federal Financial
     Accounting Standards, Volume 2.
     A7.1.3. DoD Financial Management Regulation Volume 4, Chapter 6, PP&E.

A7.2. General Ledger Accounts. Real property accounting involves a simple, basic accounting principle,
if you debit one account, you must credit some other account: DEBITS must equal CREDITS on the
general ledger account.
     A7.2.1. General Ledger account code (GLAC) 1720, Construction in Progress, represents the value of
     materials and services for CIP. The CIP costs will include accrued expenditures paid (AEP) and
     accrued expenditures unpaid (AEU), incurred each month for all open work orders related to major
     and minor construction. (Accrued expenditures paid represent materials, labor, and in-house contract
     payments that have been received and paid within the reporting month and accrued expenditures
     unpaid represent materials, labor and in-house contract payments that have been received but not yet
     paid within a reporting month).
     A7.2.2. Capitalization. If the account code is for major or minor construction and the dollar value is
     equal to or greater than threshold per DOD 7000.14-R, Volume 4, Chapter 6, the work orders will be
     capitalized. The general ledger account capitalization transactions would be to CREDIT the total cost
     in the “Actual” column from GLAC 1720 (CIP) and DEBIT some other GLAC (such as 1711- Land,
     1730 – Buildings, and 1740 – Other structures). However, with ACES the process of capitalization or
     expensing has been automated. If the construction were MILCON the RPO would accomplish a
     Transfer-In to capitalize the costs. Once the Transfer-In Form is complete, ACES will automatically
     debit and credit the appropriate GLAC accounts. Dollar values are based upon information provided
     to the RPO from the Army Corp of Engineers (COE) or the Naval Facilities Engineering Command
     (NAVFAC).

  To record the delivery (receipt and acceptance) of goods or services acquired for construction
  (used for account 2110) and the reclassification of direct expenses to construction-in-progress
  (used for account 6600). The charge to USSGL Account 6610 offsets the amount of any costs
  originally recorded into another expense account that are directly linked to a specific job or a
  product.

A7.3. Additional General Ledger Postings.
   A7.3.1. Work Orders. The costs associated with construction or other related costs (design costs, ren-
   ovations, etc) involve the electronic interface of data in IWIMS and AF accounting system, General
   Accounting Finance System (GAFS). The GAFS system provides IWIMS with contract and other cost
   transactions associated with work orders. Operations personnel input labor and material costs into
   IWIMS for each work order. These work orders will accumulate cost until final payments have been
   made. Once all costs for a specific project or contract have been received, the financial management
   section in CE will close the work order and pass it to the RPO. With ACES the process is automated
   to either capitalize or expense the dollar value that accumulated under the work order (total costs
   could include labor, material, contract, and other.)
78                                                                           AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008


     A7.3.2. Maintenance and Repair (M&R). If the Account Code is for Maintenance and Repair (M&R)
     no journal entry transaction is required. However, the RPO should review the work order to ensure the
     work classification is accurate. Generally, PP&E personal and RP repair costs shall be expensed.
     When repair is by replacement, the repair may be expensed or it may be capitalized. When repairing a
     RP facility, the components of the facility may be repaired by replacement, and the replacement can
     involve upgrading to current building standards and codes. Such replacements (repairs) may or may
     not be an improvement for accounting purposes. Crucial to the determination of whether a replace-
     ment is a repair or an improvement is the intent behind the replacement. Repair by replacement that is
     expensed, occurs when a facility or facility component has failed, is in the incipient stages of failing
     or is no longer performing the functions for which it was designated. Replacements falling into this
     category shall be expensed. If the replacement was undertaken to improve or expand the efficiency of
     an asset that was in good working order, then the replacement is an improvement. A roof or a heating
     and air conditioning system that is replaced due to the failing of the existing asset shall be classified as
     a repair and shall be expensed, even if the replacement incorporated a better quality and longer life
     shingle or a more efficient heating and air conditioning unit. Repair by replacement does not include
     rebuilding entire structures within the same physical area (footprint).
     A7.3.3. GLAC 1711 - Land and Land Rights. This GLAC accounts for acquisition (purchase cost of
     land and rights herein) and cost of easements in perpetuity. Note: Land transferred in without reim-
     bursement from another AF installation, DoD or Federal Agencies is recorded at the cost shown in the
     accounts of the losing organization. This amount is shown in the estimated value field in the Real
     property record.
     A7.3.4. Renovations. This GLAC accounts for:
        A7.3.4.1. Cost of completed major and minor construction
        A7.3.4.2. Construction cost incurred at the time of completion and acceptance of facilities for AF
        accountability, prior to determination for final costs (adjustments to this figure will be made by
        journal adjustment entry when all costs are ascertained.)
        A7.3.4.3. Buildings transferred without reimbursement within AF, DoD or other federal agencies
        are recorded at the cost of the building that’s on the accounts of the losing agency. Again this cost
        would be placed in the estimated value field in the Real Property record.
        A7.3.4.4. Cost of installed personal property, which becomes an integral part of a building, such
        as furnaces, central heating and air conditioning systems, communications systems, hot water
        heaters, and garbage disposals, etc.

A7.4. GLAC 1740 – Other structures and facilities. Accounts for:
     A7.4.1. Actual cost or estimated value of property such as exterior utility systems, exterior
     (un-housed) plants, pavements, railroads, miscellaneous structures.
     A7.4.2. Cost of completed major or minor construction.
     A7.4.3. Construction costs incurred for facilities used before completed costs are available.

A7.5. Accounting for Architectural and Engineering (A&E) Costs. Design (Planning and Designing) are
normally provided in-house when the BCE performs the construction. These costs are provided to the
RPO on the BCE Completed Work Order Cost Report when the work order is closed. When the A&E ser-
AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008                                                                                 79


vices are provided by contract, they may or may not be identified by individual projects if the A&E firm
is working on a package deal for the AF. If the RPO cannot determine the A&E cost either for BCE or
contract construction, the A&E cost is estimated at 8% of the total construction cost. Annotate in the
remarks section of the journal “Total project cost includes 8% for A&E design” also indicate actual dollar
value.

A7.6. Included costs: FASAB # 6 states “Cost shall include all costs incurred to bring the PP&E to a form
and location suitable for its intended use.” For example, the cost of acquiring PP&E may include:
Amounts paid to vendors;
Transportation charges to the point of initial use;
Handling and storage costs;
Labor and other direct or indirect production costs (for assets produced or constructed);
Engineering, architectural, and other outside services for designs, plans, specifications, and surveys;
Acquisition and preparation costs of buildings and other facilities;
An appropriate share of the cost of the equipment and facilities used in construction work;
Fixed equipment and related installation costs required for activities in a building or facility;
Direct costs of inspection, supervision, and administration of construction work;
Legal and recording fees and damage claims;
Fair value of facilities and equipment donated to the government; and
Material amount of interest costs paid.

A7.7. Prior Period Adjustment is an accounting transaction that ensures the financial statements accu-
rately reflect expenses for the appropriate fiscal year in which the expenditures occurred. For example: if
a work order was closed in September 2006 but this information didn’t reach the RPO until December
2006, then a Prior Period Adjustment is necessary in order to create an FY06 credit in GLAC 1720 (CIP)
and a debit in GLAC 7400.30 (Prior Year Adjustment Account).

A7.8. The below diagram depicts the high level flow of RP data. RPI information is used in reporting
asset information to GSA and for future year AF/DoD budget information (forecasting) as well as cost
information is reported to Treasury.

              GENERAL REAL PROPERTY ASSET MANAGEMENT CONTROLS

A8.1. Purpose. The purpose of this attachment is to provide guidance in accordance with OMB Circular
A-123 Management’s Responsibility for Internal Controls, as implemented by DODI 5010.40, Managers’
Internal Control Program Procedures, and AFI 65-201, Managers’ Internal Control Program Proce-
dures. AF installation and MAJCOM management is expected to establish effective controls to ensure
complete, accurate and timely RP inventory records. These internal controls serve as a guide or check-
point to ensure that critical actions associated with RP management are carried out in an accurate and
timely manner. The following subparagraphs represent the minimum controls to be applied at each instal-
lation with a RP accountability responsibility:

A8.2. Define Scope and Schedule:
   A8.2.1. Real property accountable officers (RPAO) will ensure that every facility record in the instal-
   lation RPI is verified for accuracy by a physical survey in accordance with AFI 32-9005; DODI
   4165.14; and DoD 7000.14-R, Chapter 6, Volume 4.
   A8.2.2. The Real Property Inventory (RPI) shall include the completion date of the most recent regu-
   larly-scheduled physical inventory. Property records shall be reconciled and adjusting entries prepared
   to bring physical and financial records into agreement at least every 5 years for general use facilities
   and every 3 years for heritage assets.
   A8.2.3. Inventory records (both quantitative and financial) shall be reconciled with the standard gen-
   eral ledger financial control accounts at least semi-annually (new activity will be quarterly).
   A8.2.4. During scheduled inventory reviews, key items to verify to original source documents
   include:
   Fund code;
   Square Footage;
   Bldg #;
   Facility ID;
   RP Interest Code;
   Category Code and supporting FAC;
   Placed in Service Date, Date Acquired, Year Built);
   Tenant Code (current occupants); and
   Status of Historical facilities, inactive or closed facilities (landfills)

A8.3. Establish Reconciliation Team
   A8.3.1. The Base Civil Engineer (BCE) is responsible for maintaining a workable interface between
   offices involved in physical and financial records of the RPI.
   A8.3.2. The BCE will use metrics in performance appraisals to assist in the timely management of the
   RPI.
82                                                                          AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008


     A8.3.3. The BCE will ensure annual RPI reconciliations with tenant activities are accomplished by a
     multi-discipline team including Roes, DFAS, AFAA, Operations/Program Managers (assisting roles),
     resource managers, and other offices/organizations required to complete the process.
     A8.3.4. Upon completion of an inspection, the BCE, RPAO or designated representative will correct
     discrepancies and prepare and certify a detailed RPI report.

A8.4. Reporting and Accountability Requirements
     A8.4.1. Ensure new facilities and capital improvements to existing facilities are posted into the RPI in
     a timely manner.
     A8.4.2. Results of the physical surveys will be kept on file in the building information file in the
     installation RP office and provided electronically to each MAJCOM.

A8.5. MILCON and Capital Improvements.
     A8.5.1. The DD Form 1354 is the key to recording new construction of facilities as well as capital
     improvements/decreases to existing facilities. The following internal controls will be applied to con-
     struction projects, at a minimum:
        A8.5.1.1. Engineering will provide a complete, correct DD Form 1354 to the REO within (3) days
        of the final inspection.
        A8.5.1.2. The REO will have (10) working days to review the form for accuracy, completeness
        and satisfactory supporting documentation and capitalize the facility.
        A8.5.1.3. If data is incorrect or incomplete, then return it to the project engineer/manager for cor-
        rections.
        A8.5.1.4. The project engineer/manager will resubmit the corrected document(s) to the REO
        within ten more (10) working days.
        A8.5.1.5. All changes are to be recorded in the same fiscal year that the changes occurred. If they
        occur after the year of execution, use the actual date of completion and provide remarks on the
        delinquency of posting.
     A8.5.2. The costs to improve a RP asset shall be capitalized when the costs of the improvement
     increases the RP asset’s square footage, size, efficiency, or useful life; e.g. if a replacement was under-
     taken to improve or expand the efficiency of an asset that was in good working order, then the replace-
     ment is an improvement to be capitalized. When a facility or facility component has failed, is in the
     incipient stages of failing or is no longer performing the functions for which it was designated it is
     NOT a capital improvement and should not be recorded in the RP inventory. It is a repair and shall be
     expensed.
     A8.5.3. Federal Financial Accounting Standards (FFAS) Number 6 requires federal agencies to rec-
     ognize RP assets when placed in service. For new construction and capital improvements, the placed
     in service date must be recorded because it directly affects depreciation expense.

A8.6. Depreciation.
     A8.6.1. Depreciation starts on the Date Placed in Service, the first date occupation of the facility is
     allowed and warranties are transferred to the DoD.
AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008                                                                               83


   A8.6.2. Keep the original Placed in Service Date when adjusting costs at receipt of final DD Form
   1354 (Date Acquired) or correcting any erroneous postings.
   A8.6.3. Beneficial Occupancy of the facility is not allowed until the BCE signs the contract accep-
   tance and the RPAO or designee signs the DD Form 1354.
   A8.6.4. Land is never depreciated.

A8.7. Disposals.
   A8.7.1. Records for all facilities planned for disposal will be annotated with the proper planned dis-
   position information and entered into ACES as soon as a determination is made that the affected facil-
   ity is to be disposed.
   A8.7.2. Archive (delete) records for all disposed RP in the same fiscal year the property was dis-
   posed. Some disposition data will be located in the Project Management functionality as it relates to
   demolition.
   A8.7.3. Use the actual date of disposal completion for posting, even in a subsequent year. After
   reporting a disposed facility one quarter, ACES will automatically delete the disposed facility from
   the system. However, if there is an outstanding open work document or a phase of a multi-phased
   work document, the ACES system will be unable to delete the disposed facility from the inventory.
   Alert the applicable office to close out all work/service orders.

A8.8. Land. Ensure records reflecting land are not part of a multiuse facility. Keep all land records sepa-
rate from other facility types.

A8.9. Leasehold improvements.
   A8.9.1. Record leasehold improvements (very seldom required) with a proper capitalization journal
   voucher and enter it into the RPI as a capital improvement. Capital improvements above the base costs
   of the negotiated lease cost or build out, i.e.., adding a Special Compartmented Information Facility
   (SCIF) to a leased building, only are recorded.
   A8.9.2. Record grant information in the RPI within ten (10) working days of receipt of the real estate
   instrument.

A8.10. Certification of Inventory Accuracy.
   A8.10.1. Monthly, provide the BCE with a list of all facilities that have been added to, or deleted from
   the RPI, (e.g., acquisition, capital improvements, and disposal) with a statement that all have been
   recorded accurately and timely.
   A8.10.2. The RPAO/REO must ensure that all RP is accounted for in ACES and maintain control of
   all RP records and documents used as a basis for official ACES/RPI records.
   A8.10.3. The Resources Manager must ensure that all RP is properly established in a general ledger
   account in the applicable accounting system (GAFS-R,). All property must be documented using
   appropriate supporting documentation.
   A8.10.4. The Civil Engineer must verify that the RPAO is conducting the required inventory. Results

     electronically results of scheduled inventory planned to actual inventoried to MAJCOMs and HQ and
     End of Year.
     A8.10.5. The BCE should periodically have the RP assigned responsible employee verify and certify
     the accuracy of the assets on the RP records. ACES inventory reports should be used for this purpose.
     The BCE will need to periodically verify the accuracy by conducting a sample test of the database
     accuracy or have internal reviewer conduct the test.
     A8.10.6. Upon completion of an inspection, the RPAO or designated representative will prepare a
     detailed RP inventory list in duplicate and submit it to BCE and Resources Manager for verification
     and signature. The following statement must be included after the last item on the last page of the
     inventory list:


‘ I CERTIFY THE ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF THIS REAL PROPERTY ACCOUNT,
AND DO, ON THIS DATE ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE REAL PROPERTY (WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF REAL PROPERTY OUTGRANTED TO OTHERS) LISTED ON THE PRECEDING
PAGES OF THIS INVENTORY RECORD, SUBJECT TO THE CHANGES AND REMARKS NOTED
AND INITIALED ON THOSE PAGES. ‘


        DATE                  SIGNATURE OF RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYEE                           TITLE/PHONE


     A8.10.7. MAJCOMs will advise HQ A7CAI at end of year of any deficiencies in the scheduled
     inventories that extend inventory dates beyond 5 years for non-historic facilities and 3 years for his-
     toric facilities.

A8.11. Accuracy, Timeliness, and Internal Controls. The use of various accounting systems requires
accuracy and timeliness for all accounting transactions. Accuracy includes the use of detailed general led-
ger accounts and sub-accounts. Timeliness includes not only posting all transactions within the same
accounting period in which the transactions occur, but also the prompt recognition and recording of
changes. All such accounting entries should be made during the same accounting period in which the
change in the value is realized.
     A8.11.1. Installations are to have Internal Controls, management review procedures, and all pertinent
     regulations/policies available in each RP office.
     A8.11.2. MAJCOMs are to publish implementing guidance for these RP internal controls. The con-
     trols outlined in this memorandum may be supplemented as the MAJCOM sees fit, however, these are
     the minimum set of controls deemed necessary to ensure sound management of the Real Property
     Inventory.

A8.12. Real Property Inventory Compliancy Metrics. The BCE should establish performance metrics to
ensure accurate and timely reporting of data. Some suggested performance metrics may include:
     A8.12.1. Cycle time in days to capitalize a fixed asset purchase
     A8.12.2. Inventory accuracy rate (number of end of year inventory corrections)
AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008                                                                                 85


A8.13. Management Control Evaluation Process.
   A8.13.1. Management Controls: Installation Commanders and Base Civil Engineers:
      A8.13.1.1. Determine that installations are updating their RP database(s) in a timely manner.
      A8.13.1.2. Determine that changes in an installations RP database(s) are internally consistent.
      A8.13.1.3. Confirm that the Targeted Data Set, due for implementation in FY08 reflects the latest
      changes in installation deletions, additions, and reassignment to different MAJCOMs.
   A8.13.2. This is a required process to evaluate the key controls. Quality Assurance (QA) of the cen-
   tral inventory database is accomplished at least semi-annually and as required. The QA process com-
   pares all current data statistics with the previous data statistics to examine trends and possible errors.

               REAL PROPERTY INVENTORY REQUIREMENTS (RPIR) PRIMER

A9.1. Introduction.
     A9.1.1. The Real Property Inventory Requirements (RPIR) is a direct result of the Business Manage-
     ment Modernization Program (BMMP) started in 2003 by the Secretary of Defense to improve busi-
     ness processes in several areas of the Department. Primary focus was on financial management and
     reporting accurate data for the Department’s financial statements.
     A9.1.2. Real property assets are essential to the preparation for and successful accomplishment of
     most Defense missions. Hence, accurate and timely RP asset data is fundamental to effective manage-
     ment of the assets, and ultimately to military success. Real property asset data links accountability,
     regulatory compliance, resource requirements and decision support. Access to accurate and complete
     data is essential across the Defense enterprise at all levels.
     A9.1.3. A business management reengineering working group comprised of RP and real estate pro-
     fessionals across the Department met and over a period of time in CY 2003 and 2004 developed a tax-
     onomy upon which to base the ‘to be’ business process.
     A9.1.4. The first questions asked were “What is an Installation?” and “What is a Site?” The RPIR
     answered the questions with a new RP structure, definitions and approximately 196 data elements.

Figure A9.1. Diagram of RPIR Relationships




A9.2. Geographic Location Codes (GEOLOCS).
     A9.2.1. The AF follows a United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) method for
     identifying installations and sub installations (now ‘sites’). Each has been identified with a four-alpha
     code obtained from the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) and followed for approval and
AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008                                                                               87


   implementation of the AF 1192 process. The entire ACES RP database is founded on the relationship
   of the GEOLOC to the rest of the inventory.
   A9.2.2. AF Form 1192 Installations Characterization Reports shall be used to document changes in
   size, status or oversight of installations and sites. See Attachment 3.

A9.3. Installation Name and Code.
   A9.3.1. Installation Name: Each AF installation name is unique and will remain the same.
   Wright-Patterson AFB will remain Wright-Patterson AFB.
   A9.3.2. Installation Code: The installation code for WPAFB is ZHTV (its current GEOLOC).
   A9.3.3. Using WPAFB as the example, the parent installation ZHTV has (at a minimum) two sites on
   the installation itself. Area B and Area A/C are non-contiguous. Therefore, the two sites that make up
   WPAFB proper will have these site codes: ZHTV0001-Area A/C and ZHTV0002-Area B.
   A9.3.4. Sub-installations under the old classification system are also sites and will be attached to the
   ‘parent’ at WPAFB. They will retain their names and codes from the old system and be linked by the
   installation name and code and the RP Site UID.

   A9.3.5. If any of the above sites has a non-contiguous parcel, it must be further divided.
88                                                                         AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008


     A9.3.6. The next foundational change was the insertion of unique identifiers (UID) for RP in the new
     taxonomy. Defense business processes were adopting UIDs for a number of processes in the Business
     Enterprise Architecture (BEA) an overarching model of the integrated business of the Department.

A9.4. Real Property Unique Identifier (RPUID). A RP (RP) site is a specific geographic location that has
individual land parcels and/or facilities assigned to it. The RPSUID will be assigned when the DoD
acquires a legal interest in the first RP asset (land parcel or facility) assigned to the site. The RPSUID will
remain associated with the site in perpetuity. After the DoD has relinquished all interest in the site (dis-
posed of it), the RPSUID will be archived along with all its associated attributes.
     A9.4.1. The DoD will use the RPUID to permanently and uniquely identify all RP assets in which it
     has an interest. The following business rules define how the RPUID is used, when it is created, and
     specifics associated with non-owned property. The RPUID:
        A9.4.1.1. Is assigned to all RP assets (parcels, buildings, structures, and linear structures) in
        which DoD has an interest;
        A9.4.1.2. Does not replace any of the commonly used identifiers currently in existence, such as
        facility number or building name;
        A9.4.1.3. Is assigned to the RP asset, not to the owner or the installation since the owner and
        installation may change over time;
        A9.4.1.4. Is not based on the characteristics of the asset and does not change when criteria of
        assignment or the attributes of the RP asset changes; and
        A9.4.1.5. Remains a part of the RP asset for the life of the asset and is archived with the asset
        record at the time the DoD relinquishes its interest.

Figure A9.3. Diagram of RPUID Relationships




     A9.4.2. To fully bring the Military Department RP under a DoD umbrella, the RPIR prescribed a reg-
     istry that provided UIDs to the Services and kept metadata on all DoD sites and assets for linkage to
     the geo-spatial data for top decision makers.
AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008                                                                                89


A9.5. DoD RPUID Registry. The Registry is the central facility for the generation and maintenance of
UIDS for site and RP assets. This DoD standardized process supported by USTRANSCOM will govern
the point in the business process in which UIDs are generated for RP.
   A9.5.1. For RP assets, a RP unique identifier will be generated at the point the AF obtains a legal
   interest in the asset thereby requiring an asset record to be created and linked to a site.
   A9.5.2. For sites, a site UID will be generated that the time the RP asset is approved and funded for
   acquisition.
   A9.5.3. Each land parcel or facility is an RP asset. The RPUID shall be assigned to the RP asset not
   the organization, owner, or manager. The RPUID will be assigned to existing facilities when DoD
   acquires a legal interest in the RP asset and remain associated with the asset in perpetuity. For facili-
   ties to be constructed, the RPUID will be assigned early in the planning process to ensure data for all
   planning and development activities is captured for later use. At least one RPUID must be identified
   at the beginning of the project. See RPCIPR (www.acq.osd.mil/ie/bei). After the DoD has relin-
   quished all interest in the asset; the RPUID will be archived along with all the associated attributes.
   A9.5.4. In order to capture data needed for the business enterprise from the RPI, the working group
   identified 196 data elements that a fully-operating RPI should have to accommodate the business
   needs of the enterprise. The AF already tracked many of the property attributes (i.e., facility number,
   state, ZIP code) but several in a way that had to be changed to meet the information transparency
   required. Additional elements were added with the two other major changes brought about by RPIR;
   i.e., changes to estimated useful life and a move from aggregated records for roads and systems to a
   systematic linking of linear assets (i.e., water treatment plants) to the pipes and conduits that make it
   a system.
   A9.5.5. The total number of data elements essential for reporting to the Office of the Secretary of
   Defense under the RPIR was further increased by the approval of the Real Property Acceptance
   Requirements (RPAR) and the RPCIPR. Approximately 260 data elements are now identified as
   essential to the fully functioning ‘to be’ business enterprise process. The additional elements will be
   programmed and populated as the technical solutions for the various new processes are developed and
   approved.
   A9.5.6. The goal of the RPIR is that as electronic systems acquire more capability, the various partic-
   ipants in the cradle to grave civil engineering processes will enter data which they ‘own’ directly into
   a computer system that will link it to the RPUID and make it available for all to use. “Enter once; used
   by all.” Only then will the data be authoritative and reliable.

A9.6. Changes in Estimated Useful Life for Facilities.
   A9.6.1. The RPIR proposed changing the generally accepted depreciation method for buildings and
   improvements. The DoD Financial Management Regulation (FMR) permits the acquisition costs for
   all permanent buildings to be currently depreciated for 40 years and each capital improvement made
   to the building to be independently depreciated over 20 years.
   A9.6.2. DoD adopted an AF-supported study from a Whitestone report that more granularly identi-
   fied useful life of a building or capital improvement based on more specific criteria involving building
   type, construction materials, etc. Changes have been proposed to the DODFMR Volume 4, Chapter 6
   to enable future facilities to be constructed or improved based on characteristics identified in the
90                                                                          AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008


     Whitestone Report and contained in the subsequent Facilities Pricing Guides from OSD Acquisition
     Technology and Logistics.

A9.7. Changes in Aggregate Real Property Records. Roads, fences, water, electrical, and other systems
are currently accounted for by aggregating the portions of the assets in a network together for summary
reporting. The RPIR provided a concept of dismantling the aggregate records into ‘nodes’ and ‘segments’
of the “linear assets” and identifying the entire system for better accountability and sustainable business
process.

A9.8. Facility Numbers. All facilities located on or under control of the installation, including privately
owned, will have a unique facility number assigned by the REO. Buildings that are connected by open
breezeways or corridors may be considered separate buildings and assigned individual numbers. Facilities
must have a common wall to be included under one facility number. Locate facility numbers on the out-
side of the facility in a location that can be readily identified.
     A9.8.1. Square footage for covered walkways or enclosed corridors that connect two facilities must
     be divided equally and applied to each facility that is connected. An exception will be a building built
     and accepted in phases on a single work order. See AFH 32-1084, Facility Requirements, for guidance
     on calculating area amounts. Do not include building wing and apartment identifiers in the official
     facility number. For administrative purposes, however, users may assign letters or numbers to identify
     apartments, wings, or other similar portions of buildings or structures for use on the installation.
     A9.8.2. Portions of a facility may be accepted on a staggered basis and capitalized when placed in ser-
     vice at different times; but all portions of the building will have the appropriate single facility number.
     Depreciation of the portion of the facility accepted will begin with the Date Placed in Service of that
     portion. The ‘Date Acquired’ will be as of the date on the final deed or Final DD Form 1354 for that
     facility.
     A9.8.3. Occupied buildings should have a street address assigned and entered into ACES-RP.
     Garages and other outbuildings will have the same address as the primary facility or house. Remote
     sites without assigned personnel may have a ZIP code as the official address in ACES RP. The official
     address of the installation will be the single address at the main gate to which express mail would be
     delivered, if no other address has been established. If the installation does not receive mail, then its
     ZIP code will function as its address.
     A9.8.4. Installation commanders may name streets within the installation boundaries under their
     jurisdiction. Memorialization of facilities or bases is Human Resources, not an engineering function.
     Guidance for memorialization is contained in AFI 36-3108, Memorialization Program and Ceremo-
     nies.
     A9.8.5. Keep the original facility number when a facility is relocated.
     A9.8.6. Assign a ‘future facility’ number in ACES-RP early in the planning process so the same num-
     ber will appear on early engineering drawings and consistently identify the facility during and after
     the construction. Ensure the new facility is identified separately from the building(s) it replaces (even
     in repair by replacement projects cited above) in all planning and construction documents.
     A9.8.7. Historic Properties: The REO will coordinate entry of appropriate classification data in the
     facility heritage assets records with the Cultural Resource Manager and periodically reconcile RP
     records with those maintained by the environmental flight. See DODI 4165.14.
AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008                                                                           91


  A9.8.8. Facility numbers may be assigned to facilities identified as equipment, i.e., test stands and
  hush houses. Assignment of a facility number does not signify A7C funding responsibility for sustain-
  ment, restoration or modernization.
  A9.8.9. Facility numbers may be assigned to facilities for which the AF has no formal property inter-
  est; i.e., municipal airports on which the Air National Guard has a joint-use agreement and responsi-
  bility for a portion of the sustainment, restoration and modernization.
  A9.8.10. Facility numbers must be assigned to non-owned property for any environmental equip-
  ment, i.e. monitoring wells, etc., located off base. The facility number will be non-reportable and
  linked to the grant number for the license and/or easement.

             REAL PROPERTY ACCEPTANCE REQUIREMENTS (RPAR) PRIMER

A10.1. The DoD Business Modernization Program produced the Real Property Inventory Requirements
(RPIR), approved by the I&E Domain Governance Board (DGB) in January 2005. The RPIR is the basis
for the modernized RP inventory lifecycle business processes that will meet the Department’s current and
future requirements for asset accountability and valuation.

A10.2. The I&E DGB approved a document in August 2006 to identify the full requirements for DoD
Components to bring new assets into the Services RP Inventory. The Real Property Acceptance Require-
ments (RPAR) is a matrix that examines each of the ways in which RP is successfully added to the RPI. No
new requirements were identified, although additional data elements were developed to capture the addi-
tional information for audit purposes, or use by participants related to acceptance.

A10.3. The following acquisition scenarios were identified:


Condemnation,
Gifts and donations,
Land purchase,
Land purchase including facilities,
Leases,
New construction, restoration, and modernization,
Occupancy agreement,
Reversion,
Transfer between Services,
Transfer from one federal entity to another, and
Withdrawal of public domain land



A10.4. The RPAR effort covers the portion of the RP lifecycle that begins when a designated DoD RP
official is notified that a RP asset is ready to be accepted. This most often occurs as a result of construc-
tion of new facilities or the improvement of existing facilities, but can also include purchases, in-leases,
exchanges, transfers, or any other method of acquiring a legal interest in a RP asset.

A10.5. The RP acceptance process for acquisition of assets and improvements generally ends on the cal-
endar date the RP asset is formally accepted by DoD. On this date, the government assumes liability and
the warranties begin for the asset. In the case of a purchase, the date of delivery or deed recordation rep-
resents the acceptance date. In the case of construction, acceptance occurs on the date of execution of the
AFI32-9005 14 AUGUST 2008                                                                                93


DD Form 1354 (both ‘interim’ and ‘final’), and is the key event that relieves the CIP account and triggers
the capitalization and depreciation of the RP asset.

A10.6. Acceptance depends on the method of acquisition and can be found in the charts on pages 5 and
6. The charts also depict a data element called ‘Placed-in-Service Date’ and how it may be automatically
populated based on the method of acquisition. Initial acquisition methods are depicted in the first chart
while improvements to previously acquired facilities are depicted in the second chart. For the purpose of
the business process models, capital improvements are associated to the new construction, restoration,
and modernization scenario and leasehold improvements are associated to the leases scenario.

A10.7. The steps identified for acceptance of RP are similar to the steps identified for acceptance of per-
sonal property and other goods and services within DoD. The terms used in the RPAR are the terms that
relate the activity to a business process, and the business process to the DoD Business Enterprise Archi-
tecture (BEA). The BEA is the over-arching process model that connects activities in Installations &
Environment (I&E) with Logistics, Financial Management, and Human Relations. The BEA is based on
common definition of terms, data elements, and activities that may never have been used to describe a real
estate activity (i.e. ‘goods and services rendered’ may mean ‘construction accepted’).

A10.8. Additional data elements were added to the list of RPIR elements that need to be populated by the
various parties participating in the final inspection and acceptance processes. These data elements will be
programmed into the AF RP inventory system in years after FY09 and procurement of a long-term infor-
mation technology solution for the Civil Engineering Business Process. Interim auditability will be based
on the engineers obtaining physical and financial data from construction agents and passing the data to the
real estate office for capitalization in accordance with the UFC for Transfer and Acceptance of Military
Real Property UFC 1-300-08, the CIP Requirement, and AFI 32-9001, Acquisition of Real Property.

A10.9. The last page of this primer is a suggested format for collecting the data that supports the comple-
tion of the acquisition in accordance with the RPAR, and to support the audit trail. The following data ele-
ments will be programmed into ACES RP or its successor and populated in accordance with the RPAR
when policies and procedures have been developed and trained.

A10.10. The following figures define and display the matrix of activities that need to be followed to
ensure the acquisition process is successfully completed, the deliverables received, and the assets
recorded in the RPI.

Figure A10.1. Definitions of Acceptance Scenarios from the Real Property Acceptance Require-
ments (RPAR)1


Capital Improvement       Any improvement that increases the useful life, efficiency, capacity, size of an
                          existing asset or modifies the functionality or use of the asset, regardless of the
                          source of funding or capitalization threshold.
                          Examples:
                          Increases the useful life: major replacements or reconstruction to restore
                          facilities damaged by a natural disaster (i.e., reconstruction of a new building
                          on an existing foundation
                          Increases efficiency: install building insulation
                          Increases capacity: raising the roof on a warehouse to increase cubic feet
                          Increases size: build an addition, expansion, or extension to the building, i.e.,
                          increase footprint
                       Modifies functionality: convert an office to a warehouse or upgrade
                       architectural elements that has not or is not failing, e.g., upgrade a flat roof to a
                       pitched roof.
Condemnation scenario The taking of non-Federal (generally private) property for Federal public use,
                       with the required payment of just compensation, through the use of judicial
                       proceedings rather than direct purchase. A condemnation can be of any
                       property interest including fee, servitudes such as easements, or leaseholds.
Gifts and donations    A voluntary transfer of property. A gift may be a conditional (e.g., for military
scenario               use) or unconditional contribution, donation, or bequest of property including
                       real estate or facilities to be constructed on Department lands.
Fixture (Known at DoD In the law of RP, fixtures are anything that would otherwise be a chattel
as Real Property       [personal] that have, by reason of incorporation or affixation, become
Installed Equipment)   permanently attached to the RP. At law, fixtures are treated in the same manner
                       as RP, particularly under the law of security for debt. A classic case of a fixture
                       is a building, which in the absence of language to the contrary in a contract of
                       sale is considered to be part of the land itself and not a separate piece of
                       property.
Land purchase scenario The Department acquires the right of ownership of land which is generally
                       transferable and includes some aspect of control over the property. The level of
                       control will depend on the nature of the interest acquired. For example, an
                       easement will allow control for the purposes of the easement while a fee will
                       generally include total control of the property.

Land purchase             The Department acquires the right of ownership of land which is generally
including facilities      transferable and includes some aspect of control over the property including
scenario                  facilities. A purchase of the fee generally includes all fixtures (e.g., structures)
                          on the land, but can, if the purchase is so ordered, exclude certain fixtures. If all
                          fixtures are excluded, the land purchase scenario would apply.
Lease scenario            An agreement by which an owner of RP (lessor) gives the right of possession to
                          another (lessee), for a specified period of time (term) for a specified
                          consideration (rent). The leasehold estate must include the right of possession.
New construction,         New construction is the acquisition of buildings or structures through
restoration, and          construction that results in a new “footprint.” Restoration means the restoration
modernization scenario of RP to such a condition that it may be used for its designated purpose.
                          Restoration includes repair or replacement work to restore facilities damaged
                          by inadequate sustainment, excessive age, natural disaster, fire, accident, or
                          other causes. Repair work is not subject to acceptance into the RP inventory,
                          and is not considered a capital improvement. Modernization means the
                          alteration or replacement of facilities solely to implement new or higher
                          standards, to accommodate new functions, or to replace building components
                          that typically last more than 50 years (such as the framework or foundation). If
                          the restoration or modernization improvement extends the useful life, increases
                          the efficiency, capacity, or size of an existing asset, or modifies the
                          functionality or use of the effected asset, the improvement is subject to the
                          acceptance.
Occupancy agreement The financial terms and conditions under which GSA assigns and an agency
(OA) scenario             occupies GSA-controlled space are documented in a written OA. An OA is
                          required for each agency space assignment.
Reversion scenario        The right to possession of an estate previously conveyed to the original grantors
                          or its successors or assigns upon the occurrence of a qualifying event. The
                          reversion may be automatic or it may require the action of the hold of the
                          reversionary interest to affirmatively enforce the reversion. Example: A grants
                          a life estate to B; the estate reverts back to A on B’s death.
Transfer between          A real estate action which changes the custody and control of RP and its related
Services scenario         personal property to or from one military department to another without
                          compensation.
Transfer from one         A real estate action which changes the custody and control of RP to or from
federal entity to another another federal entity with or without compensation pursuant to title 40, United
scenario                  States Code.
Withdrawal of public      Public lands that have been set aside or designated for a specific public purpose
domain land scenario      such as a national park, wildlife refuge, or national defense use. Withdrawal of
                          public lands generally segregates such lands from lease, sale, settlement, or
                          other uses or dispositions under the public land laws

NOTES:
The RPIR is a dynamic document, requiring changes periodically to keep in compliance with real estate
and RP statutes and regulations. HQ AF A7CAI participates with other military department representa-
tives and OSD in further refining, adding, deleting, or changing definitions of data elements under the
RPIR and its sister documents, the RPAR and CIPR.
Each individual involved in RP accountability should read the three requirements documents and keep
up-to-date with Software enhancements, releases and guidance released from AFCESA and HQ AF/
A7CAI.
