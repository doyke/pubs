                                            Chapter 2

                                     POLICY – GENERAL

2.1. Family Housing (FH) Policy Overview. Rely on the community first to provide adequate
and affordable FH. When a shortage of housing exists in the community, as determined by the
HRMA, provide adequate government housing, giving priority to personnel who must live on the
installation for military necessity. Use 98 percent as a goal for measuring occupancy of existing
assets and determine management actions when occupancy fails to meet that goal. Mandatory
housing is allowed only in foreign OCONUS locations under certain conditions (paragraph
4.7). NOTE: The terms dependent and family member are synonymous.
2.2. Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA). The SOFA between the United States and foreign
governments takes precedence over AF housing policy.
2.3. Equal Opportunity in Housing. Provide FH to eligible personnel of all Services without
regard to race, color, religion, sex, familial status, handicap or national origin.
2.4. Leasing and Subleasing. Leasing or subleasing of FH is not authorized (Comptroller
General (CG) Decision B-140917 and 39 CG Decision 401).
2.5. Independent Duty (ID) Personnel. The Air Force provides housing for ID personnel on
the same basis as other active duty military personnel (Priority 2). Installations plan and program
adequate housing to support active duty military families; therefore, it is critical to ensure
accurate ID populations are included in the manpower and requirements data provided in the
HRMA.
2.6. Support Agreements. A host-tenant support agreement may be established between Air
Force commands, organizations, units or elements and between an AF organization and another
Military Service (Interservice Support Agreement) or another federal agency (Interagency
Support Agreement). The Commander may authorize personnel covered in the interservice or
interagency support agreement (ISA) to live in Air Force-controlled housing on the same basis as
AF members. Follow procedures in AFI 25-201, Support Agreements Procedures and DoD
Instruction (DoDI) 4000.19, Interservice and Intragovernmental Support, for agreements with
non-AF Services and agencies. The Air Force Office of Regional Issues (HQ USAF/A5XX) is
the approval authority for agreements with another country.
2.7. Air Force Standardized Housing Brochure. Provide an installation-specific housing
brochure to housing residents upon assignment. Brief residents of their responsibility for such
routine maintenance, minor repair, operation and housekeeping typically expected of tenants in
similar community housing. See paragraph 6.6 for resident responsibilities to be briefed at the
initial, preterm and final inspections, responsibilities for routine M&R during occupancy and for
departure cleaning. See the following AFC- ESA website for format and content of the
Brochure.
http://www.afcesa.af.mil/userdocuments/publications/miscellaneous/ceo/ceok/housingbroch
uretemplate.pdf.
2.8. Resident Liability. Military and civilian residents are held liable for loss and damage to
their assigned FH unit, including equipment, furnishings, grounds and exterior facilities in their
area of responsibility caused by the abuse or negligence of the member, dependents, guests and
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                            17


pets, and for failure to clean an assigned unit satisfactorily upon termination (10 U.S.C. 2775 and
DoD Regulation (DoDR) 7000.14).
   2.8.1. At the time of assignment, inform residents of the FH unit replacement cost,
   recommend renters insurance and explain that when liability is determined, residents are
   required to pay for damages (paragraph 6.6.2).
   2.8.2. Include a resident liability clause in every housing maintenance contract that requires
   the contractor to report suspected resident abuse or negligence when observed.
   2.8.3. The Housing Flight makes the initial determination whether or not the resident is
   responsible for the abuse or negligence, informs the resident of their liability and ensures the
   cost of damage is collected.
   2.8.4. Liability is determined in accordance with (IAW) 10 U.S.C. 2775 and AFMAN 23-
   220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property. AFMAN 23-220 requires the Air Force to
   investigate and report damages or losses to government-owned housing of $500 or more. The
   Commander may, however, initiate an ROS for damages or losses under $500 as appropriate
   for the circumstances.
   2.8.5. The ROS process may be disregarded when the value is less than $500 and the
   member is willing to pay for the damage. If the resident does not pay voluntarily, the
   Housing Flight requests a Report of Survey (ROS).
   2.8.6. With approval of the Housing Flight, the resident may repair the damage, pay a
   commercial contractor to repair the damage or allow the housing maintenance contractor to
   repair the damage and reimburse the government. In any case, the repair must have
   government approval before the inspector clears the member from FH.
   2.8.7. For abandoned units, arrange for a commercial contractor to clean and repair occupant
   damages and seek reimbursement from the member using DD Form 139, Pay Adjustment
   Authorization.
   2.8.8. Authority to deduct the cost of FH damage from the civilian employee pay is in DoDR
   7000.14, Financial Management Regulations, Chapter 8.
   2.8.9. Credit money collected for loss, damage to or cleaning FH to the installation MFH
   Operations and Maintenance (O&M) account. The Housing Flight monitors collection of
   damage assessments.
2.9. Insurance and Reimbursement Claims Against the Government. The government does
not provide personal property or liability insurance for residents. Recommend to residents that
they secure adequate insurance coverage for their needs. The installation legal office considers
claims for reimbursement of personal property at a depreciated amount when FH is damaged
through no fault of the resident. Advise the resident to seek further assistance from the
installation Judge Advocate (JA), if specialized advice is required.
2.10. Privately Owned Firearms. Residents must comply with AFI 31-101, The Air Force
Installation Security Program (FOUO) and other installation firearms policy.
2.11. Social Visits. FH units are appropriated for use as single-family dwellings and may not be
jointly occupied by more than one family. If defined as a dependent (Attachment 1), a relative
of the member or spouse is not considered a social visitor, regardless of the length of stay.
 18                   AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


   2.11.1. Bonafide social visits of 30 days or less do not constitute joint assignment of FH.
   2.11.2. Social visits of military personnel assigned to the installation and civilians residing
   outside the commuting area are limited to 30 days, and those residing within the commuting
   area are limited to 2 days. The Commander may authorize extension of social visits. When
   such visits by personnel authorized BAH, OHA or LQA extends beyond 30 days, or another
   time period approved by the Commander, the visit will be reclassified as joint occupancy.
   Joint occupancy is not authorized.
       2.11.2.1. IAW JFTR U10002 and U10300, BAH and OHA is not authorized when a
       military member occupies adequate Government quarters.
       2.11.2.2. IAW DSSR 132.43 LQA is terminated when a civilian employee occupies
       government quarters at no personal expense, except when the employee occupies
       government quarters during the temporary absence of the regular occupant and at the
       same time is obliged to maintain his/her own quarters.
2.12. Live-in Childcare Provider (Nanny): FH residents may employ a live-in childcare
provider with approval of the Commander. In coordination with the installation JA and Security
Forces (SF), the Housing Flight develops a standardized installation template for members to use
in requesting a live-in child- care provider. The Housing Flight forwards requests meeting the
following criteria to the Commander for approval:
   2.12.1. Resident has dependent child, infant through high school age, residing in household.
   2.12.2. Nanny’s family status and relationship to member are identified.
   2.12.3. Nanny will reside in FH, unaccompanied.
   2.12.4. Private bedroom is available for nanny IAW this AFI and adherence to Table 4.3.
   2.12.5. Request meets installation the JA legal requirements for federal, state and local
   domestic employment laws and contracts, host nation provisions and SF security
   requirements for background checks, base entry and access to facilities. NOTE: Approval of
   a live-in childcare provider does not imply entitlement to benefits or privileges to which
   nonfamily members are not otherwise entitled nor does approval represent a FH bedroom
   requirement.
2.13. Commercial Activity in Family Housing (FH). Limited commercial activity that can be
properly carried out from a FH unit is allowed. Commercial activity is defined as a business
enterprise conducted for profit by family members assigned to a FH unit (DoDM 4165.63).
   2.13.1. Activities may involve direct sales of products, minor repair service on small items,
   incidental services, tutoring and limited manufacture of items.
   2.13.2. Sale of specific brand name merchandise not available in military exchanges is not
   construed as competition with installation officially sanctioned commerce.
   2.13.3. The member submits a written request to conduct commercial activity in assigned
   FH to the Housing Flight Chief. The Housing Flight Chief forwards request to the
   Commander for approval. Approval is required before business start-up.
   2.13.4. The following policies apply:
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                           19


       2.13.4.1. Commercial activity may not be authorized or continued at the expense of
       community tranquility, safety or the installation mission.
       2.13.4.2. Local government licensing requirements, agreements, host nation business
       practices and advertising practices are taken into account as each request is considered.
       The member is responsible for obtaining necessary licenses.
   2.13.5. Childcare in FH units is a unique category of commercial activity and is governed by
   AFI 34-276, Family Child Care Programs (paragraph 2.17).
   2.13.6. The resident may request minor self-help modifications to FH unit to facilitate
   commercial activity. If approved, the resident follows self-help guidelines, complies with
   electrical and fire safety codes, pays for the modification and restores the FH unit to its
   original configuration upon departing the installation.
   2.13.7. DoDR 5500.7, Joint Ethics Regulation (JER), applies to soliciting from personnel
   junior in rank or grade. Family member employment in FH is authorized if the family
   member complies with this AFI and other Service regulations prohibiting solicited sales to
   subordinates. The prohibition against door-to-door solicitation, in person or via printed
   material, applies (DoDD 1344.7, Personnel Commercial Solicitation on DoD installations).
   2.13.8. Advise residents to obtain personal liability insurance, to cover the risk of legal
   actions from customers and damage to government property, since residents conducting a
   private business in FH could be held personally liable for loss or damage.
2.14. Resident Responsibility for Grounds. FH residents are responsible for maintaining
grounds for their exclusive use extending from the footprint of the structure to the border of
common areas. Exclusive use is defined as the area within a natural boundary (playground, tree
line, sidewalk, driveway, fence, common area boundary such as a park, picnic area, flower
garden, and so forth) or halfway to adjoining residence. Provide information in the installation-
specific housing brochure for grounds care unique to the installation and area.
   2.14.1. The MAJCOM Commander may approve a waiver for the government to provide
   partial or complete grounds care when one of the following criteria is met. Approval
   authority in this AFI applies to non-GOQs only and may not be delegated below the
   MAJCOM Civil Engineer. For GOQ grounds maintenance waivers, see AFI 32-6003.
       2.14.1.1. The residence is prominently located and makes a unique contribution to the
       appearance of the installation.
       2.14.1.2. The area for the exclusive use of the resident is extremely large (more than ½
       acre). Waiver provides government-furnished grounds maintenance beyond the ½ acre
       surrounding the home. For ease of grounds maintenance and overall appearance, the
       Housing Flight Chief and resident jointly determine the location and layout of the ½ acre
       for which the resident is responsible.
       2.14.1.3. Areas with unique landscaping, extra large trees or shrubbery, or trees requiring
       professional service or specialized equipment.
2.15. Self-Help Program. The Air Force supports the Self-Help Program to foster pride of
ownership in FH. This program allows residents to accomplish minor work in their FH unit to
benefit their living conditions and can reduce maintenance costs to the government. Housing
funds support the FH Self-Help Program, and the BCE and Housing Flight jointly establish
 20                   AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


guidance to operate the program (AF Pamphlet 32-1098, Base Civil Engineer Self-Help Guide,
and paragraph 11.11).
   2.15.1. Residents submit AF IMT 332, BCE Work Request, to request minor modifications
   to the housing unit and surrounding grounds and may request government-furnished
   materials on the AF IMT 332.
   2.15.2. When AF IMT 332 requests grounds work and digging is required, an AF IMT 103,
   Base Civil Engineer Work Clearance Request, must be approved before starting work.
   2.15.3. The housing inspector or respective shop craftsman inspects self-help projects, and
   the Housing Flight maintains Self-Help Program records on file and in ACES-HM. Self-help
   improvements may be donated by the resident and accepted by the Air Force when
   workmanship and aesthetics meet acceptable construction standards. Self-help work must
   not be used to increase the square footage of the unit by constructing additions or enclosing
   and weather proofing existing exterior porches, carports, patios or decks, and so forth.
   Inform the resident that FH unit must be returned to the original configuration before
   departing the installation unless the government or incoming resident accepts project.
   Advise resident of requirement to comply with the installation-specific housing brochure for
   grounds care unique to the installation and area.
2.16. Self-Help Store. The Housing Flight Chief coordinates the self-help store operations with
the BCE or provides for a contractor-operated store if housing maintenance is contracted.
   2.16.1. The self-help store makes available to housing residents a list of stocked housing
   items, customer training and guidance on completing basic tasks and instructions for using
   tools.
   2.16.2. Self-help stores may provide hand tools and lawn equipment on a loaner basis but
   may not provide materials for installation of in-ground lawn sprinklers to FH residents.
2.17. Self-Help Work in FH to Support the Family Child Care Program. In most instances,
modifications to FH dwelling units supporting the installation Family Child Care Program are
accomplished using donated self-help labor and materials. When clear evidence shows the
Family Child Care Program is unable to provide adequate childcare because of the high cost of
home daycare modifications and the installation mission could be affected, the Commander may
authorize government-funded labor and materials to support required FH modifications
(paragraph 2.13.5, AFI 34-276 and AF Pamphlet 32-1098).
2.18. Flags in Family Housing (FH). At the Commander’s discretion, FH M&R funds may be
used to purchase and install United States (American) flags. Make flags available through the
installation Self-Help Store.
2.19. Lawn Irrigation Systems. To reduce irrigation requirements in arid and semiarid
climates, use xeriscape principles to the maximum extent practical and as comparable to local
community housing.
   2.19.1. Lawn irrigation systems may be provided in (1) any yard size, regardless of rank,
   where the average annual rainfall is less than 20 inches as defined by the Air Force Combat
   Climatology Center (AFCCC) (Attachment 2 and Air Force Family Housing Guide) or (2)
   in any yard ½ acre or greater (lot size less the footprint of the unit). NOTE: For GOQs only,
   approval is SAF/IEI.
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                          21


   2.19.2. In installing irrigation systems, do not create a condition that violates Executive
   Order 13148, Greening the Government Through Leadership in Environmental Management
   and Guidance for Presidential Memorandum of Environmentally and Economically
   Beneficial Landscape Practices on Federal Landscaped Grounds, 60 Federal Register 40837.
2.20. Key and Essential (K&E), Command and Special Command Positions
(SCP). MAJCOM approval authority is required to hold FH units vacant for more than 90 days.
Refer to AFI 32-6003 for guidance on general officers and SCPs.
   2.20.1. MAJCOM commanders may require K&E personnel, including incumbents of
   command positions, to reside on the installation as a condition of employment. MAJCOM
   and installation commanders should strictly limit K&E positions to those necessary to reside
   on the installation to perform their mission.
   2.20.2. The Commander may designate specific FH units for personnel in K&E, SCP and
   Command positions who reside on the installation as a matter of military necessity.
   Commanders may assign a member, other than the intended occupant, to a designated
   housing unit. Assigned members acknowledge, in writing, they may be required to relocate at
   government expense to another on-base or off-base housing compatible with their grade and
   bedroom requirement when the FH is required by designated incumbent.
       2.20.2.1. (Added-JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURST) Designated Housing at JB

          2.20.2.1.3. (Added-JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHHURST) The following Command
          Chiefs/ Command Sergeant Majors (E-9s) will have designated homes in the following
          homes. Ideally, inbound members for these positions will move into the quarters of the
          outbound members, enabling a one-for-one swap out. If a situation exists which does not
          allow the one-for-one swap out, the affected E-9s will work with the 87 ABW/CCC in an
          attempt to secure different housing within the Starlifter Housing Area. The 87
          AWW/CCC will then make a recommendation to the JB MDL/CC:

          2.20.2.2.1. (Added-JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURST) There is value added to
          the missions of JB MDL by having members of different services interspersed
          throughout the different housing areas and neighborhoods; therefore, consideration
          should be given to ensure that areas do not become service specific.
          2.20.2.2.2. (Added-JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURST) Due to the scope of
          Command Billets and the likelihood of hosting community leaders at their quarters,
          the following positions should be housed in Falcon Courts East or a Dix Farm House
          to maximize the entertainment value of Colonel Housing:

East or a Dix Farm House.

2.20.2.2.3. The following Commanders will be housed in quarters with close proximity to the
Air Mobility flight line due to their critical role in McGuire Air Field missions:

   2.20.3. K&E and Command housing may be held vacant for 90 days pending the arrival of
   incumbent.
   2.20.4. The Commander establishes a K&E position only when there is a compelling need
   for a member to live on base. For example, incumbent is required to respond to continual
   operational requirements or emergencies and off-base residency would adversely impact the
   installation readiness, safety and security or health and welfare of the base population. The
   Commander identifies K&E positions in an installation supplement to this instruction.
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                          25


       2.20.4.1. Do not designate a specific FH unit for every incumbent of a K&E position;
       instead, reserve certain areas or groups of houses for K&E personnel.
       2.20.4.2. When housing is not immediately available identify incumbents of K&E
       positions in ACES-HM, which places them at the top of the appropriate waiting list. This
       includes the freeze zone, but does not displace members with a firm housing
       commitment.
       2.20.4.3. The Commander may waive the requirement for an incumbent of a designated
       position to reside on the installation under the following conditions:
           2.20.4.3.1. Adequate FH is not or will not be available to meet incumbent’s family
           size and composition, or housing is geographically separated from the installation and
           is the only suitable housing available.
           2.20.4.3.2. The incumbent owns or is purchasing housing in the local community at
           the time of assignment to the K&E position. Incumbents with this waiver who
           subsequently apply for government housing are placed on the waiting list, compete
           with other members in their grade and bedroom category and are not given priority
           assignment.
   2.20.5. Command positions are commanders and vice commanders of MAJCOMs,
   numbered Air Forces, centers, wings, groups and their deputies and command chief master
   sergeants (CCM) of MAJCOMs, numbered Air Forces, centers, wings and installations.
   MAJCOM commanders may authorize additional command positions and designate specific
   housing units. Authority may not be delegated below the MAJCOM Civil Engineer.
2.21. Unaccompanied Personnel in Designated Position. When a member assigned to a
Command or K&E position is single or not accompanied by family members and there are no
other on-base facilities, such as visiting quarters (VQ), FH may be diverted to UH. Use FH funds
to maintain FH diverted to UH. Diverted FH must comply with congressional M&R limits.
Update ACES to reflect the diversion and assign member to UH (AFI 32-6005).
2.22. Unaccompanied Members in Housing with Dependents Residing Elsewhere. Under
certain conditions, members with dependents residing elsewhere may occupy housing and
receive BAH at the with-dependent rate.
   2.22.1. A member may occupy UH or other government housing that does not exceed
   minimum standards (Table 2.1) for the member’s grade without dependents and still be
   eligible to receive BAH at the with-dependent rate if (a) member is unaccompanied and (b)
   family members are not residing in adequate government housing elsewhere (DoD Financial
   Management Regulation (FMR), 260301C).
   2.22.2. The following applies only to personnel designated as K&E. All others are ineligible
   for this exception: If the member occupies UH or other government housing which exceed
   the unaccompanied minimum standard for member’s grade, BAH is terminated. If the
   occupied housing is the only housing available and (a) housing is not suitable for joint
   occupancy or (b) housing is suitable for joint occupancy and jointly occupied with another
   member of the appropriate grade permanently assigned to the duty station, BAH may not be
   terminated.

       2.22.2.1. AF policy is to discourage the use of government-owned FH units as temporary
       UH. FH units or other housing temporarily designated as UH are considered adequate for
       joint occupancy if they have at least two private bedrooms, two separate full bathrooms,
       with a total net living area at least equivalent to the total net living area the joint residents
       would each be entitled to if it were permanent UH. Members in grades O-1 to O-10, W-1
       to W-5 and GS-10 and above must have access to a living room, kitchen and dining area
       (not necessarily private) as shown in Table 2.1.
       2.22.2.2. Regarding clause (b) in paragraph 2.22.2, the housing must actually be jointly
       occupied, although such housing may be singularly occupied for no longer than 30 days
       to accommodate a change if one of the joint residents departs permanent change of
       station (PCS). SAF/IE may approve waivers to this policy to relieve hardship
       circumstances (other than financial).
   2.22.3. This provision applies to all locations and to FH units or other government housing
   temporarily designated (diverted) as UH.
   2.22.4. Assign unaccompanied members to housing that meet minimum adequacy standards
   for their grade, when possible.

 NOTES:
      1. If quarters are not suitable for joint occupancy, pay BAH.
        2. If quarters are suitable for joint occupancy and are jointly occupied, pay BAH; if
           not jointly occupied, do not pay BAH.
2.23. Prestige Family Housing (FH) and Command Chief Master Sergeants (CCM).
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                         27


   2.23.1. Designate all E9 housing as prestige housing, categorized as follows (Table 4.2 and
   Table 4.3):
       2.23.1.1. Air Force E-9 CCMs, and equivalent members from other Services residing on
       Air Force installations and joint bases managed by the Air Force, position listed on
       CMSAF-approved list; specific prestige unit designated; four-bedroom requirement; 10
       percent size increase applies (paragraph 2.23.2).
       2.23.1.2. E-9 K&E; Commander may designate specific prestige housing unit; four-
       bedroom requirement.
       2.23.1.3. All other E-9s; prestige housing; three- or four-bedroom requirement; based on
       family size and composition.
   2.23.2. All prestige housing must meet standards in the Air Force Family Housing Guide for
   Planning, Programming, Design and Construction. For new/replacement construction, units
   designated for CCMs (only those approved by the CMSAF) may be increased by an
   additional 10 percent of the largest sized E-9 house at the installation, not to exceed the
   programming benchmark size of new/replacement construction (1940 net square feet
   (NSF)/2410 gross square feet (GSF)) (Air Force Family Housing Planning Guide for
   Planning, Programming, Design and Construction).
   2.23.3. Commanders must carefully review and validate designated E-9 positions. The
   HRMA determines maximum on-base prestige housing requirements. Since CCMs are
   K&E, assignment priority is the same as other K&E personnel. Identify prestige housing in
   ACES by changing the designation to “Chief Prestige” and maintain a separate waiting list.
   2.23.4. The Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force (CMSAF) is the approval authority for
   any changes to CCM positions at the MAJCOM, wing, number AF, joint command and
   center, including equivalent members from other Services residing on Air Force installations
   and joint bases managed by the Air Force. See the CMSAF-approved list at
   https://cs.eis.af.mil/a7cportal/ProgramGroups/Housing/.aspx.         Submit request for
   additional prestige housing units through the MAJCOM Civil Engineer to HQ USAF/A7CH.
   Include the following justification: Title of position Normal grade for position Present
   incumbent of position Identification of unit proposed for such designation Reason to
   establish prestige FH requirement Impact if not approved
       2.23.4.1. Title of position
       2.23.4.2. Normal grade for position
       2.23.4.3. Present incumbent of position
       2.23.4.4. Identification of unit proposed for such designation
       2.23.4.5. Reason to establish prestige
       2.23.4.6. FH requirement Impact if not approved
2.24. Unit Moves and Base Closures. Give equal consideration for available housing at the
gaining installation to all eligible DoD personnel identified for PCS reassignment during a unit
move. It is essential to provide members advance notice of housing available at the gaining
installation so they can make suitable arrangements for their families. Public notification of
housing availability promotes morale and efficiency of personnel, whether advance or
 28                   AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


incremental staff. Due to time-phasing activities of unit moves (especially multiple units),
commanders of the losing and gaining installations usually negotiate the effective merger date of
waiting lists to ensure equity for all concerned and the shortest possible waiting lists. Send
unresolved issues to the MAJCOM Civil Engineer for resolution and to HQ USAF/A7CH for
final determination, if necessary. The following procedures apply:
   2.24.1. Losing Commanders:
       2.24.1.1. Identify personnel selected for PCS reassignment with the unit.
       2.24.1.2. Submit list of eligible personnel to be considered for FH at the gaining
       installation. Arrange list from losing installation, considered the advance application, by
       grade category and effective date of housing application. Send list to the gaining
       installation at least 45 days before the effective date of the unit move.
       2.24.1.3. Submit proposed K&E personnel list to the gaining installation commander.
       2.24.1.4. If required, enter into host-tenant negotiations at the earliest practical date
       before the unit move (paragraph 2.6).
   2.24.2. Gaining Commanders:
       2.24.2.1. Merge incoming unit personnel list with existing FH waiting lists.
       2.24.2.2. Evaluate impact of the unit move on existing waiting lists and revise housing
       assignment forecasts.
       2.24.2.3. If applicable, enter into host-tenant negotiations with the incoming unit
       commander.
       2.24.2.4. If adequate FH is unavailable, make other arrangements to house incoming
       personnel.
       2.24.2.5. Provide effective housing services to all personnel, including expanded housing
       referral services, as necessary.
   2.24.3. Honor commitments for housing assignments at the gaining installation, issued
   before the waiting lists were merged.
   2.24.4. Merge the final personnel list of the incoming unit with the gaining base waiting lists
   at least 30 days before the scheduled arrival of the incoming advance party. If the incoming
   unit personnel strength is revised before the effective date of the unit move, adjust the
   merged waiting lists, accordingly. Merge the waiting lists on a pro rata basis, as follows:
       2.24.4.1. Merge the list from losing base A (300), with the waiting list of gaining base B
       (100), as follows: B-A-A-A-B-A-A-A and so forth. Do not bump members in a freeze
       status on the gaining installations waiting list.
   2.24.5. Post the merged waiting lists in the Housing Flight for public view by incoming units
   and by the gaining installation.
   2.24.6. Send a welcome package and provide forecasted waiting times to incoming
   personnel. Use an ACES-generated or locally produced DD Form 1747, Status of Housing
   Availability.
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                             29


   2.24.7. Give incoming K&E personnel priority housing assignment but do not displace
   members on the waiting list who have a firm commitment for housing.
2.25. Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Transition Personnel. Move members and
their families on a scheduled basis with continual coordination among all functional installation
activities. Close FH units consistent with the capability to provide essential support and services.
Current FH residents who are members of the BRAC team placing the base in caretaker status
may send their dependents to the next duty station in advance of their departure. The following
conditions apply:
   2.25.1. Assign housing to unaccompanied family members at the gaining installation under
   normal priority and procedures. The effective date of application is the walk-in date of the
   family member.
   2.25.2. The sponsor’s projected arrival date to gaining installation is within 90 days.
   2.25.3. The qualifying family member presents a duly executed Power of Attorney (POA)
   with authorization to conduct housing business, PCS orders and a letter signed by the losing
   Commander certifying the member is delayed due to assignment to a transition closure team.
   2.25.4. The family member’s decisions on personal preference options, bedroom and
   housing acceptance are final and may not be overturned by the sponsor.
2.26. Government-Owned Carpet. Installed carpet, including pad, is considered an alternative
floor finish and an integral part of the FH unit. Professionally clean government-installed carpet,
as needed, typically during change of occupancy, IAW the most current engineering technical
letter (ETL) and manufacturer instructions to preserve the quality and life of the carpet.
   2.26.1. When carpet is authorized, install carpet in living areas, except kitchen, bathroom,
   powder room, patio, porch and areas exposed to weather. Avoid installing carpet at
   entrances and heavy-traffic areas. To minimize damage to flooring and subflooring, glue-
   down installation is not allowed.
   2.26.2. Maintain the following historical information in the Housing Flight for each carpet
   installation:
       2.26.2.1. Location (FH address, building number and rooms).
       2.26.2.2. Name of carpet manufacturer, pattern and color.
       2.26.2.3. Manufacturer certification that carpet conforms to the most recent ETL Air
       Force Carpet Standard. ETLs are available at the following AFCESA website:
       http://www.afcesa.af.mil/library/etl.asp?Category=Engineering%20Technical%20L
       etters
       2.26.2.4. Date of installation.
       2.26.2.5. Method of installation and type of pad used.
       2.26.2.6. Certification of disposal and certification that new carpet meets AF standards.
   2.26.3. Purchase quality carpet with a minimum 7-year life expectancy, meeting AF
   standards in the Air Force Family Housing Guide for Planning, Programming, Design, and
   Construction and the most recent ETL. Before purchase, the BCE certifies the carpet meets
   AF carpet standards.
 30                   AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


   2.26.4. Selected carpet must be a neutral color, such as beige, taupe or off-white in a light to
   medium shade that provides a flexible background that can integrate with the decor of
   successive occupants. Do not use pure whites or dark shades. Use solid colors or muted
   tone-on-tone tweeds.
   2.26.5. When replacing carpet in less than 7 years, the Commander or delegated
   representative certifies the carpet is no longer serviceable and requires replacement, and
   replacement carpet meets AF standards (paragraph 1.6.9.10 and AFI 32-6003).
2.27. Automated Civil Engineer System-Housing Management (ACES-HM) and
Automated Housing Referral Network (AHRN). ACES-HM is the Air Force Civil Engineer
standard management software for managing family and unaccompanied housing. Use data
extracted from ACES-HM to validate the IFHMP and FH Military Construction (MILCON)
projects, identify and monitor surplus housing and develop management initiatives. ACES-HM
is the primary tool used to plan, advocate, program, design and execute FH and UH
requirements. AHRN is the single DoD repository for rental housing property. Do not fund or
use other information systems when the functions exist in ACES and AHRN and do not
duplicate AHRN functions in ACES.
   2.27.1. Reporting and data extraction (mining) occur at every level of command and the
   assumption is that data in ACES-HM is accurate and reliable. It is critical that housing staffs
   at all locations use ACES-HM exclusively to record, manage, monitor and track the
   following:
      2.27.1.1. FH applicants, waiting lists, change of occupancy maintenance (COM), offers,
      declinations, projections and assignments into and out of government-controlled housing.
      2.27.1.2. Inspection schedules, inspection results and M&R of FH units.
      2.27.1.3. Drayage and storage, authorizations and obligations.
      2.27.1.4. Type, total number and status of FH facilities; including surplus units
      determined by the most current HRMA, units identified as inadequate by type based on
      the Condition Assessment Matrix (CAM) score from the latest HCP, inactive and
      diverted units.
   2.27.2. Except at locations where AHRN is deployed use ACES for community housing
   referral and relocation. At deployed locations, use AHRN for managing housing referral and
   relocation programs. At foreign OCONUS locations only, record and maintain member
   (community) leases in ACES.
   2.27.3. Develop a quality assurance (QA) program to promote data integrity and employ best
   practices to ensure timely and accurate information is maintained in ACES-HM. A
   responsive QA program is required to enable accurate occupancy metrics, validate HRMA,
   HCP, IFHMP, justify funding, develop management initiatives and to reconcile BAH with
   FSOs.
   2.27.4. The ACES generated MFH Occupancy and Utilization Report is the AF tool for
   determining the utilization FH facilities, providing justification for funding, managing
   change of occupancy timelines, and supporting construction, demolition and renovation of
   assets. Installations and MAJCOMs accomplish reporting requirements in accordance with
   the latest AF/A7CA guidance.
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                          31


       2.27.4.1. Installations with traditional FH accomplish the ACES generated MFH
       Occupancy and Utilization Report quarterly, inclusive of 01 Oct - 31 Dec (1st quarter),
       01 Jan - 31 Mar (2nd quarter), 01 Apr - 30 Jun (3rd quarter) and 01 Jul - 30 Sep (4th
       quarter) and forward to their MAJCOM.
       2.27.4.2. MAJCOMs review installation quarterly reports to validate type, total number
       and status of FH facilities, including surplus units determined by the most current
       HRMA, units identified as inadequate, by type, based on CAM scores from the latest
       HCP, inactive and diverted units and change of occupancy timelines.
       2.27.4.3. MAJCOMs forward the installation reports to HQ USAF/A7CA by the 5th of
       Feb, May, Aug and Nov of each calendar year.
   2.27.5. Coordinate day-to-day ACES operations with communications squadrons
   (installation network control centers) and provide notification to the 754 Electronics Systems
   Group (ELSG), Combat System Support Help Desk, to facilitate reconciliation of slow
   response times and connectivity issues. The 754 ELSG Help Desk website is
   https://ceds.ssg.gunter.af.mil/login.asp.
2.28. Education Leave of Absence Program (ELAP):
   2.28.1. Members enrolled in ELAP may retain FH while enrolled in the ELAP program on a
   space available basis, but must pay a rental charge equal to BAH at the member’s current
   grade, beginning the date the ELAP contract is signed. The Housing Flight computes the
   rental rate, prepares and sends the paperwork to finance. The member is responsible for
   arranging rental payments with the FSO. ELAP members may apply for waiver to rental
   payments on same basis as other hardship cases (10 U.S.C. 708).
   2.28.2. To the extent possible do not displace ELAP enrollees from FH except to house
   K&E personnel. The member may retain housing while enrolled in ELAP, even though there
   is a waiting list for the type and bedroom category of the house occupied.
2.29. Environmental Hazard Disclosure. Fully disclose to FH residents the following
environmental hazards, either upon assignment, delivery to residence or by making available in
public access areas, as appropriate. Refer residents who report potential environmental-related
health issues to their health care provider. Request the Bioenvironmental Engineer determine
requirements for a follow-up health risk assessment. Coordinate development and periodic
update of the installation fact sheets with the BCE and Bioenvironmental Engineering. See
www.epa.gov for ordering brochures and extended information.
   2.29.1. Asbestos. Upon assignment, provide resident an installation letter or fact sheet about
   the potential risk of asbestos exposure, either locally developed or adapted from information
   on the EPA website. Inform residents of common elements of housing, particularly older
   housing, that contain asbestos (for example, floor tiles and adhesives, furnace ductwork,
   roofing shingles and siding) and the potential for exposure to asbestos fibers when items are
   cut, sanded or scraped.
   2.29.2. Lead and Lead-Based Paint (LBP). Upon assignment, provide resident the EPA
   pamphlet, “Protect Your Family from Lead in Your Home.” Include an installation-specific
   information paper or letter containing lead sampling performed by the installation and how to
32                  AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


  access sampling results for their FH unit or unit type. Maintain a signed disclosure form in
  resident file.
  2.29.3. Mold. Upon assignment, provide resident the EPA publication, A Brief Guide to
  Mold, Moisture and Your Home, and make the guide available to all residents in an
  appropriate public area. Additionally, provide a current installation-specific fact sheet
  including the preventive measures in paragraphs 2.29.3.1–2.29.3.6 to residents in coastal
  areas and other locations with high humidity, in housing with a history of water damage and
  in housing where construction design has proven susceptible to mold growth.
     2.29.3.1. Immediately on FH resident notification of mold, a housing inspector and a
     maintenance service provider jointly conduct a visual inspection of the unit to identify
     mold growth and water leaks on wall surfaces and in building systems (HVAC,
     ductwork, roof, windows, and so forth) and potential safety risks (electrical shock and
     structural failure). If indicated by the inspection, determine habitability of the unit, and
     schedule a comprehensive inspection and repair according to severity of the problem.
     Keep the resident fully informed of inspection results and remediation plans.
     2.29.3.2. If mold is located in multiple areas or is so extensive (more than 10 square feet)
     that remediation or repair cannot be accomplished in the service provider emergency
     response time- frame, immediately relocate resident to temporary lodging until
     assessment is complete.
     2.29.3.3. Refer residents reporting mold-related health concerns to their health care
     provider for an evaluation. If requested by the health care provider to support medical
     diagnosis and treatment, request Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) conduct an
     appropriate health risk assessment.
     2.29.3.4. Based on recommendation from a health care provider or as required by the
     scope of the repair, relocate resident from temporary lodging to another adequate house.
     2.29.3.5. For minor mold and mildew or condensation on ceilings, walls and windows,
     request service provider measure indoor humidity and advise resident on how to keep
     humidity low (below 60 percent).
     2.29.3.6. Recommend the following mold preventive measures to FH residents, modified
     as appropriate for the installation, but under no circumstances require a resident reporting
     mold sensitivity to clean mold from their FH unit. In high humidity locations,
     periodically publish preventive measures in the installation newspaper:
              • Dry condensation from affected areas
              • Increase air circulation by using a household fan, kitchen vent hood exhaust
                while cooking and bathroom exhaust when shower is in use
              • Minimize dust accumulation throughout the house and clean mildew from
                visible surfaces using a detergent and water or mild household cleaner,
                wearing ordinary household rubber gloves
              • Routinely empty water from the air conditioner drip pan
              • Report recurring leaks and persistent mold, mildew and moisture to the
                Housing Flight or maintenance service provider
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                          33


   2.29.4. Radon. Upon assignment, provide resident with the EPA publication, A Citizen’s
   Guide to Radon, The Guide to protecting Yourself and Your Family From Radon, and
   summary results from any installation radon testing. EPA and the Surgeon General
   recommend testing all homes below the third floor level for radon. Consider furnishing
   simple radon test kits in the Self-Help Store.
2.30. Sex Offender Disclosure. Commanders must ensure military and civilian housing
applicants disclose all names of persons who will reside in the home and disclose if they are a
sex offender and are registered, or required to register, on the National Sex Offender Public
website. Since disclosure could impose residency restrictions, develop a disclosure process,
consistent with federal and state laws, in coordination with the Commander, Staff Judge
Advocate (SJA), Security Forces (SF), Force Support Squadron (FSS), and Housing Asset
Manager. Compliance is mandatory, except in foreign countries where compliance will be
determined by the MAJCOM/CC based on host-nation requirements and sensitivities. Use the
following procedures to process sex offender disclosure and application for housing:
   2.30.1. Use AF Form 4422, Sex Offender Disclosure and Acknowledgement, in conjunction
   with DD Form 1746, Application for Assignment to Housing, to assign members to housing.
   This disclosure notifies members and applicants of sex offender disclosure requirements and
   policies, and memorializes their certification of sex offender status of each prospective
   resident.
   2.30.2. A military member or civilian applicant for housing, who discloses that he or she or
   another prospective resident of his or her home is a sex offender, must provide required
   documentation, when requested, in order for the Commander to make a final residency
   determination. Failure to disclose required information will result in denial of housing
   application and/or eviction from base housing. Documentation should include the following,
   but additional information may be required:
       2.30.2.1. Whether the sex offender is the military member, civilian or dependent.
       2.30.2.2. Nature and circumstances of the offense.
       2.30.2.3. Precise criminal statute or law under which the person was convicted.
       2.30.2.4. State or jurisdiction in which the offense occurred and was adjudicated.
       2.30.2.5. Time passed since the offense was committed.
       2.30.2.6. Age of the offender at the time the offense was committed.
       2.30.2.7. Age of the victim at the time the offense was committed.
       2.30.2.8. Evidence that tends to demonstrate the applicant’s subsequent rehabilitation,
       exemplary conduct, or other commitment to obedience to law.
       2.30.2.9. Whether the conviction requiring registration has been reversed, vacated, or set
       aside or if the registrant has been granted an unconditional pardon of innocence for the
       offense requiring registration.
       2.30.2.10. Conditions of parole or probation or monitoring, if any.
 34                   AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


   2.30.3. Applications by members who disclose he or she or a member of the household is a
   registered sex offender must be coordinated with the SJA, SF, and the FSS before
   Commander determination.
       2.30.3.1. The SJA verifies that all resulting actions are conducted IAW state and federal
       law.
       2.30.3.2. The SF verifies through state and federal registration databases that the
       individual is registered and coordinates with parole officers when the individual is under
       supervision.
       2.30.3.3. The FSS ensures all areas near or where children congregate are considered
       (such as home day care providers) and that home day care providers and others residing
       in the home are disclosed.
   2.30.4. After coordination, forward the application package to the Commander for approval
   or disapproval of housing residency.
   2.30.5. When a Commander decision is rendered, immediately notify parties concerned.
2.31. Pets in Family and Privatized Housing. Commanders must establish a local pet policy
incorporating AF restrictions, as a minimum. The Installation Commander has waiver authority
regarding pets in housing. See AFI 32-6007, Privatized Housing Management, reference
incorporation of policy in project documentation and individual lease agreements.
   2.31.1. Residents currently boarding the type and number of pets prohibited by this
   instruction may continue to board the pet until they terminate housing unless the pet
   demonstrates a propensity for behavior described in paragraph 2.31.2.1.
   2.31.2. Residents in government-controlled housing must comply with applicable federal,
   state and local laws, installation-specific requirements for pet ownership, registration, control
   and vaccination, and adhere to the following guidelines:
       2.31.2.1. Unprovoked barking, growling or snarling at people approaching the animal.
       2.31.2.2. Aggressively running along a fence line when people are present.
       2.31.2.3. Biting or scratching people.
       2.31.2.4. Escaping confinement or restriction to chase people.
   2.31.3. Residents may not board exotic animals such as, but not limited to, reptiles, rodents
   (other than hamsters and guinea pigs), ferrets, hedgehogs, skunks, rats, raccoons, squirrels,
   pot bellied pigs, monkeys, arachnids, or any farm animal.
   2.31.4. Pets must be secured with leashes or under positive control while outdoors, except in
   fenced patios and yards. Pets must not be left tied or unattended in exterior appurtenances or
   unfenced yards, or allowed to run loose outside fenced yards.
   2.31.5. Pet owners must maintain current immunizations on all pets. Dogs and cats are
   required to wear a collar or harness with current rabies attached.
   2.31.6. Pet areas must be cleaned regularly to control and prevent vermin infestation. Pet
   feces must be picked up daily or immediately if the pet evacuates outside the patio or yard.
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                       35


   2.31.7. Operating a commercial kennel is prohibited. Use AF Form 4422, Sex Offender
   Disclosure and Acknowledgement, in conjunction with DD Form 1746, Application for
   Assignment to Housing, to assign members to housing. This disclosure notifies members and
   applicants of sex offender disclosure requirements and policies, and memorializes their
   certification of sex offender status of each prospective resident.
2.32. Contingency Quarters. AFI 34-246, Air Force Lodging Program, allows Installation
Commanders to temporarily open contingency quarters to accommodate large influxes of enroute
TDY personnel resulting from emergency or wartime conditions who cannot be housed in
regular base lodging accommodations.
   2.32.1. Vacant and available FH may be identified for use as contingency quarters.
   2.32.2. When FH units are identified for contingency quarters, use MFH O&M funds for
   facility-related expenses such as M&R, utilities, and contract cleaning. Limit M&R
   expenditures to minor M&R activities. No major M&R activities should be undertaken. For
   all other requirements, such as equipment and supplies, related to the lodging function
   (linens, cleaning supplies, dishes, etc), use 3400 funds.
       2.32.2.1. FH categorized as “excess” (required per HRMA but not currently occupied)
       and “adequate surplus” are authorized FH funding for the duration of the contingency.
       2.32.2.2. FH categorized as “inadequate surplus” cannot be used as contingency quarters
       for more than 6 months. At the end of this period, housing must be disposed of IAW para
       9.12.
   2.32.3. MAJCOMs notify AF/A7CH when FH units are identified for use as contingency
   quarters, and include the following information:
       2.32.3.1. Circumstances creating the need for the contingency quarters.
       2.32.3.2. Number of units being used.
       2.32.3.3. Estimated length of time contingency quarters will be required.
       2.32.3.4. Inactivate units used for contingency and identify this use in the Remarks
       section of the FH Occupancy and Utilization Report.
2.33. Confirmation of Arrival Roster. AFI 36-2102, Base-Level Relocation Operations,
Chapter 3, paragraph 3.6 requires the Customer Support Section (CSS) to instruct newly arrived
personnel to report to the government HMO and the Financial Services Office (FSO) to complete
required in-processing actions. The FSO and HMO monitor the weekly confirmation of arrival
roster to make sure newly arriving personnel receive accurate BAH and all relocation and
referral services described in Chapter 7.

                                           Chapter 3

                            ELIGIBILITY AND APPLICATIONS

3.1. Eligibility of Military Members. Members of all Military Services who are commissioned
officers, warrant officers and enlisted personnel on active duty and eligible for BAH at the with-
dependent rate, except military-married-to-military (mil-to-mil), are eligible for FH when
accompanied by a dependent or will be accompanied by a dependent within 30 days except
dependent college student. In OCONUS areas, personnel are eligible for FH if they are serving
an accompanied tour and are accompanied or will be joined by authorized command-sponsored
dependents within 30 days. NOTE: The terms dependent and family member are synonymous.
   3.1.1. Mil-to-Mil Members:
       3.1.1.1. Mil-to-mil members are authorized FH when jointly assigned to the installation.
       In OCONUS areas, both members must be serving an accompanied tour in the area.
       3.1.1.2. When mil-to-mil parents are separated and have joint custody of common
       dependents, only the member receiving with-dependent BAH is authorized housing.
       When physical custody is divided equally between the mil-to-mil parents, only the
       member receiving with-dependent rate BAH is assigned FH (DoDM 4165.63).
       3.1.1.3. When a mil-to-mil couple divorces while residing in government-controlled
       housing, the member who obtains court-ordered physical custody for more than 6 months
       may retain FH. The other member is considered unaccompanied for housing purposes.
   3.1.2. Mil-to-mil parents Separated with Joint Custody of Common Dependents. Only the
   member receiving with-dependent BAH is authorized housing. When physical custody is
   divided equally between the mil-to-mil parents, only the member receiving with dependant
   rate BAH is assigned FH (DoDM 4165.63). If the child will be absent from the FH household
   for more than 30 days, the member must have a Commander-approved waiver to retain FH
   pending return of dependent at a specified date.
   3.1.3. Single Military Members. An unmarried military member with joint legal custody of
   dependent children and physical custody for more than 6 months per year is eligible for FH.
   The member is not required to terminate FH while the children are residing with the other
   parent, and the 6 months need not be consecutive but must equal 181 days. Retain a copy of
   the court order or settlement document with the application for government-controlled
   housing to show custody periods.
       3.1.3.1. (Added-JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURST) Single Military Members. K&E
       military members that come to the Joint Base unaccompanied (either with dependents
       living elsewhere or without dependents entirely), are still required to live on the
       installation, either in privatized housing or in UPH. If these unaccompanied members
       occupy privatized housing, these members will pay the without dependent Basic
       Allowance for Housing (BAH). Unaccompanied military members that hold positions in
       designated houses must live in those designated houses, choosing a smaller unit is not
       allowed. Only the installation commander can waive their requirement to live on the
       installation. For officers senior in rank to the JB MDL/CC, officer housing determination
       will be the USAF EC/CC or higher, as appropriate.
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                          37


   3.1.4. A single pregnant member may apply for housing 60 days before the expected
   delivery date. A physician statement is required to certify pregnancy and anticipated delivery
   date. The member may be assigned housing when authorized with-dependent BAH (DoDM
   4165.63). If the installation diverts excess housing to UH, the member may occupy the unit
   up to 60 days before the anticipated delivery date. Update ACES to reflect the diversion.
   Use FH funds to maintain housing when diverted to UH. When the member is authorized
   with-dependent BAH, reestablish the unit as FH. Before housing assignment in OCONUS
   areas, the member must provide evidence of application for command sponsorship and tour
   extension as an accompanied member.
   3.1.5. A member with pending marriage may apply for housing 60 days before the marriage.
   A written statement by the member of intent to marry and the date of the event accompanies
   the application and member provides proof of marriage before housing assignment. In
   OCONUS areas, the member must be serving an accompanied tour and have command
   sponsorship for dependent before assignment to FH. The member must provide proof of
   command sponsorship at OCONUS locations before housing assignment.
3.2. Eligibility of Civilian Personnel. Civilians are eligible to reside in FH, when meeting one
of the following criteria. See Chapter 5 for housing civilian personnel:
   3.2.1. In CONUS and OCONUS, when civilian is K&E and required to live on base as a
   condition of employment (5 U.S.C. 5911, 5 U.S.C. 5912, OMB Circular A-45).
   3.2.2. In OCONUS when appropriate and adequate housing, support services and facilities
   do not exist, are not readily available within the private community or may not be used
   without restrictions (DoD Directive 1400.6).
   3.2.3. In OCONUS, when housing is excess to the needs of the military personnel assigned,
   or those attached to the installation or in the area (5 U.S.C. 5912).
   3.2.4. (DELETED))
   3.2.5. If surplus FH exists at the installation.

   1. Provision does not include surplus housing. See Attachment 1, Terms for Excess Housing
      and Surplus Housing defined.
 NOTES:
 1. Foreign military personnel pay rental amount equal to the BAH rate of the comparable U.S.
    military personnel grade. Once established at the beginning of the tour of duty, do not increase the
    monthly rental charges during the tour regardless of whether the foreign officer is promoted or U.S.
    officers receive an increase in BAH.
 2. Entitlement to BAH for either/or both members is governed by Department Of Defense Military
    Pay and Allowances Entitlements Manual (DoDPM), part 3, and 37 U.S.C. 403.
 3. Both members are authorized housing if each member has dependents in his or her own right.
 4. If members have joint custody of common dependents, only the member collecting the with-
    dependent rate BAH is entitled to FH.
3.3. Applications for Family Housing (FH). As required, assist applicants with the application
process. Eligible members may submit applications to the gaining installation Housing Flight
any time after receiving PCS or active duty orders. The member completes DD Form 1746,
Application for Assignment to Housing, and provides PCS orders. ANG and Reserve
members provide active duty orders. If applying online at the Air Force Portal (secure) or
through ACES, members provide orders via FAX, electronic transmission or postal service to the
 44                    AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


gaining installation Housing Flight. Personnel acting on behalf of a military member must also
provide a duly executed POA. The effective date of application is the date members depart their
losing permanent duty station (PDS). If available housing at the gaining installation is privatized,
contact the local Housing Flight for information in assisting member to submit an advance
application. The status of housing applications is available in 2-3 business days at
https://www.airforcehousing.hq.af.mil/.
   3.3.1. Members with an impending entitlement (promotion, increase in the number or
   maturation of dependent) that would entitle member to an additional bedroom in the
   following 12 months must provide supporting documentation and note the entitlement in the
   remarks section of the application. Members applying at the Housing Flight provide
   documentation with the housing application. Members applying online provide information
   on the advance application, print a confirmation copy and present the online application and
   supporting documentation to the gaining Housing Flight upon arrival. The Housing Flight
   requires a physician statement to confirm pregnancy and a written statement from the
   military personnel flight (MPF) to confirm selection for promotion.
       3.3.1.1. Advanced Application. Members ordered to active duty or PCS to a new
       location may submit advance applications. The effective date of advance applications is
       the date the applicant departs the losing installation (including members with TDY
       enroute) or the date ordered to active duty. The effective date of application may not
       predate the date of entry on active duty.
       3.3.1.2. Walk-in Applications. The effective date for a member who walks into the
       gaining installation Housing Flight is as follows:
           3.3.1.2.1. If within 30 days of arrival, the application date will be the departure date
           from the losing installation.
           3.3.1.2.2. If more than 30 days after arrival, the application date will be the date of
           the walk-in.
           3.3.1.2.3. If the date of application is the walk-in date and dependents have not
           arrived on the installation or arrival is more than 30 days; the application date will be
           the date member’s dependents arrive on the installation.
   3.3.2. Mil-to-Mil personnel assigned to the same duty station may apply for FH before
   approval of joint spouse assignment when one member arrives before the other.
   3.3.3. A family member, with a POA duly executed by the member, may apply for and be
   assigned housing at the gaining installation when the member departs an accompanied tour
   and performs temporary duty (TDY) enroute to the PCS location. When the military member
   is attending Officer Training School, the family member may accept enlisted housing if
   available, but will be required to move into officer housing after the newly commissioned
   officer arrives at the installation. The move will be at member’s expense.
   3.3.4. (Added-JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURST) Application for Privatized Family
   Housing for K&E Personnel. Personnel that will be filling a K&E position may submit an
   advance application to the Government Housing Office and the Privatized Housing Office 90
   days prior to their estimated arrival. This application will place them on the waiting list for
   the category of housing they are authorized and the privatized housing contractor will hold
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                              45


   the next available unit in that category of housing until they arrive. However, if another
   personnel that is filling a K&E position files an application and arrives earlier, the first
   available quarters will go to the earlier arrival, even if they signed up at a later date. Arrival
   date for K&E positions takes precedence over length of time on the wait list.
       3.3.4.1. (Added-JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURST) For designated housing, the
       inbound senior leader should expect to move into quarters on or about the Change of
       Responsibility date. If the outbound senior leader remains on station in a different
       position, the outbound senior leader can expect to be moved out of quarters to a non-
       designated home at government expense. A government paid move will not be
       authorized if the outbound senior leader is retiring, separating or PCSing; the outbound
       senior leader would remain in the home until moved on such orders. For officers senior
       in rank to JB MDL/CC, officer housing determination will be the EC/CC or higher, as
       appropriate.
       3.3.4.2. (Added-JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURST) IAW AFI 32-6001, table 11.1,
       Member/Dependent Eligibility and Government Funded Moves, if dependents remain in
       a designated unit and are later required to move for an incumbent, they are not authorized
       a government move.
3.4. Unauthorized Applications. Members may not apply for (or be assigned to) FH under any
one of the following circumstances:
   3.4.1. Member is notified (if member knows date) of impending PCS and has less than 6
   months remaining on station, or until retirement or administrative separation, except for
   reasons of military necessity or to relieve a hardship. Paragraph 3.4.3 does not apply to this
   prohibition.
   3.4.2. The Commander has evicted the member from FH. Reapplication requires written
   authorization from the Commander.
   3.4.3. Member does not agree to occupy the FH unit for 1 year.
3.5. Application To, From and Between OCONUS Locations. The requirements and
conditions for submitting advance applications for housing to and from OCONUS areas follow:
   3.5.1. PCS from CONUS to OCONUS location. The advance application date for FH at the
   gaining installation is the date member departs the losing CONUS installation.
   3.5.2. PCS from Long Tour In OCONUS to CONUS. The advance application date for FH
   at the gaining installation is the date member departs the losing installation. If the member
   elects a consecutive OCONUS tour, due to base closure or drawdown, the date of estimated
   return from overseas (DEROS) changes. If the transfer is within 30 months of the date
   member departed CONUS or date member arrived in theater, the advance application date at
   the gaining installation is the date of departure from the CONUS losing installation or arrival
   date in theater, whichever is later. Confirm date departed CONUS via PCS orders.
   3.5.3. Transfer Within or Between OCONUS Theaters Before Completing Tour. Advance
   applications from members involuntarily transferred before completing their OCONUS tour
   within or between OCONUS theaters may receive priority placement on the gaining
   installation waiting list. The following rules apply:
 46                      AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


       3.5.3.1. The effective date of application is the date of departure from the first losing
       installation. If member submitted no application to the second losing installation, the
       effective date for the gaining installation is the date the member departed the first losing
       installation, assuming the member was then eligible for FH; otherwise, the effective
       application date is the date of eligibility for FH.
       3.5.3.2. Maximum credit may not exceed authorized tour length at the gaining
       installation.
       3.5.3.3. The transfer must occur before the last 6 months of member’s current tour.
       3.5.3.4. The member must apply for housing at the gaining installation within 30 days of
       arrival to obtain retroactive credit.
3.6. Unaccompanied Dependents Restricted (UDR) Tour.
   3.6.1. Eligibility:
       3.6.1.1. Applicants (including members of other Services) eligible for FH and
       transferring from a UDR tour receive priority placement on the gaining installation
       waiting list on the date the application is received. Give credit for the number of months
       spent on the UDR tour at the losing installation and limit credit to the normal UDR tour
       length.
       3.6.1.2. Applicants deployed to the Central Command (CENTCOM) area of
       responsibility (AOR) for a consecutive 365 days and will PCS within 60 days of
       returning to their assigned location receive priority placement. The effective date of
       application will be the date the member entered the AOR. Require a copy of member’s
       paid travel voucher to verify date of application.
       3.6.1.3. Family members relocating to other than home-basing or follow-on assignment
       location.
   3.6.2. Procedures:
       3.6.2.1. When member applies for FY within 30 days of returning from a UDR tour, add
       member to the waiting list effective the first day of the arrival month member entered the
       UDR without bypassing members in the freeze zone.
       3.6.2.2. When member is authorized home basing or a follow-on assignment and has
       departed the installation or is at the UDR location, a family member with a duly executed
       POA may apply for and occupy government housing in CONUS and OCONUS in
       member’s absence.
           3.6.2.2.1. The effective date of the application is the date the family member applies
           as a walk-in or online applicant. If the family member has not received a housing
           assignment when the member completes and returns from the UDR tour, the
           application effective date is adjusted to include, but may not exceed, the UDR tour
           length.
           3.6.2.2.2. Do not give short tour credit to mil-to-mil members when both return from
           a joint remote tour of duty.
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                     47


         3.6.2.2.3. Date of rank (DOR) is adjusted to reflect UDR credit for eligible senior
         officer applicants. NOTE: The SOFA between the United States and foreign
         governments takes precedence over AF housing policy. Members should determine
         SOFA restrictions before commitment to any action that might leave family members
         unaccompanied. In some countries, family members may not be allowed to remain in
         country when the military member is no longer assigned to the installation. Caution
         member to verify housing and TLA entitlements or restrictions at the follow-on
         location with the MPF before requesting advance travel for dependents.

                                           Chapter 4

                            OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES

4.1. Waiting Lists. The Housing Flight maintains separate waiting lists in ACES by grade,
bedroom requirement and type of housing requested (Table 4.1, Table 4.2 and Table 4.3).
4.2. Prioritizing Waiting Lists. Use the following priorities to determine placement on the
waiting list. Commanders may approve other than the following priority placement on a case-by-
case hardship basis.
   4.2.1. Priority 1. Members and civilians assigned to SCP, K&E positions and Command
   positions. Personnel with Commander-approved hardships, after SCP, K&E and Command
   positions (AFI 32-6003).
   4.2.2. Priority 2.
       4.2.2.1. Eligible members and equivalent civilians (in OCONUS areas) who are assigned
       or attached to the installation for duty, or assigned to another installation served by the
       Housing Flight and housing support is authorized by an ISA or Letter of Agreement
       (LOA).
       4.2.2.2. Members of all Services assigned ID to the housing market area with no housing
       support available from their parent Service.
       4.2.2.3. Unaccompanied dependents of members serving a UDR tour meeting
       requirements in paragraph 3.6.
       4.2.2.4. Public Health Service, U.S. Coast Guard and other non-DoD federal agency
       members receiving a housing allowance.
       4.2.2.5. ARC Director.
   4.2.3. Priority 3. All other members and civilians eligible for FH but not assigned or
   attached to the installation.
   4.2.4. Priority 4. Unaccompanied dependents of members (except members on a UDR tour),
   foreign liaison and SAT personnel.
4.3. Managing Waiting Lists. The DoD premise is each family member (dependent, exclusive
of spouse), is assigned a bedroom if existing housing inventory permits; otherwise, determine
housing requirement by grade, family size and composition, but do not place a member on more
than one waiting list. Display a current waiting list in the Housing Flight for public viewing, as
well as other locations accessible at other than normal duty hours.
   4.3.1. Determine appropriate bedroom entitlement based on the member’s grade and family
   composition (Table 4.1, Table 4.2 and Table 4.3). Use the table that provides the most
   bedrooms unless the member voluntarily accepts less.
   4.3.2. Members may voluntarily apply for and be assigned FH that has one bedroom less
   than their entitlement, if such housing exists in their grade category.
       4.3.2.1. No more than two dependent children may be assigned to a bedroom unless the
       Commander certifies in writing one bedroom can accommodate more (DoDM 4165.63).
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                        49


     Members who voluntarily occupy housing with fewer bedrooms than their entitlement
     may apply for larger housing immediately after assignment. The application date will be
     as a walk-in or the original effective date if the member applied within 30 days of PCS
     arrival. The member pays for a subsequent move into larger housing.
  4.3.3. Members occupying FH and gaining an entitlement within 12 months, such as an
  increase in number of dependents, maturation of children or promotion, may apply for
  housing and be placed on the waiting list. The effective date of application is when the
  member walks into the Housing Flight. Housing is not assigned until the event occurs unless
  the waiting list is exhausted or the installation has adequate excess housing. The member
  pays for the move except as provided for in paragraph 11.10.1.1.
  4.3.4. Members on the waiting list should notify the Housing Flight when there is a change
  in their housing entitlement, including promotion, demotion, divorce, remarriage, gain in
  dependents, dependents no longer residing with member or member no longer residing with
  dependents. When category of housing or bedroom entitlement changes, the member may
  transfer to a new waiting list using the same date of application from which the waiting list
  member transferred.
  4.3.5. Except for the assignment of K&E personnel and hardship cases, the top 10 percent of
  each waiting list is protected from bumping (freeze zone).
  4.3.6. A mil-to-mil member assigned to the installation may remain on the waiting list for up
  to 3 months awaiting approval of joint spouse assignment, but must be removed from the
  waiting list if the joint spouse does not join the member at the gaining installation
  (paragraph 3.3.2).
  4.3.7. Members accepting a written commitment for assignment to housing are removed
  from the waiting list and the commitment is honored.
  4.3.8. Maintain senior and general officer (O-6 to O-10) waiting lists in the following order
  using the date of rank as the effective date of application in ACES:
          Grade
          Date of Rank (DOR)

           Grade
           Date of Rank (DOR)
           Length of service
           Date of birth
  4.3.11. Consider community housing as the primary source of housing for a FH applicant
  with more dependents than can be suitably housed in available on-base housing using Table
  4.1, 4.2 and 4.3. Consider exceptions on a case-by-case basis when the local community
  cannot support the housing requirement. The Commander may consider temporarily
  converting two adjoining housing units into one large unit or approving a waiver to allow
  more than two children to share a bedroom.
     4.3.11.1. Members on the waiting list in the same category that are eligible for the next
     higher, then lower, bedroom requirement.
     4.3.11.2. Members on the waiting list in the next higher, then lower category, which are
     eligible for the same bedroom requirements.
     4.3.11.3. Members on the waiting list in the next higher, then lower, category and
     bedroom requirements.
     4.3.11.4. Other members according to priorities in paragraph 4.2.
  4.3.12. Exhausted Waiting List. When a waiting list for a specific bedroom requirement
  within a category of housing is exhausted and there are no eligible applicants, the projected
  vacancy is offered to other members according to the priorities below. The most urgent
  housing need determines whether the vacancy is offered to a lower or higher category:
     4.3.12.1. Members on the waiting list in the same category who are eligible for the next
     higher, then lower, bedroom requirement.
     4.3.12.2. Members on the waiting list in the next higher, then lower category, who are
     eligible for the same bedroom requirements.
     4.3.12.3. Members on the waiting list in the next higher, then lower, category and
     bedroom requirements.
     4.3.12.4. Other members according to priorities in paragraph 4.2.

4.4. Housing Availability. Within 2-3 workdays of receiving an advance application for
housing, forward ACES-generated DD Form 1747 or locally produced fact sheet to the member
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                           53


outlining the housing status at the gaining base. Commanders may incorporate procedures into
the installation in-and-out processing process to make sure applicants promptly report to the
Housing Flight, a requirement also stated on members PCS orders.
4.5. Assignment to Family Housing (FH). Do not use or assign FH identified on real property
records as temporary housing. Use ACES and the ACES-generated AF IMT 1326, Change of
Occupancy Report, to record and track offers, refusals and assignments. Offer the first available
uncommitted house to the first eligible member on the waiting list and physically present at the
installation. If reasonable attempts fail to contact the member, make the offer to the next
member on the waiting list. The assignment is complete when the member accepts keys for the
housing unit. Unless the installation has excess housing (see Attachment 1 for definition), do
not assign FH to members with less than 6 months retainability at the installation. Do not assign
housing until the member is present for duty and is accompanied or will be joined by family
members within 30 days (dependent college students excepted) at the installation, except for
families of members on UDR assignment and base closure transition personnel and family
members authorized by paragraph 3.3.3. Make offer and obtain acceptance in writing.
   4.5.1. Give member a minimum 30-day advance notice of assignment to FH to allow time to
   notify landlord of their intent to move. If a 30-day notice is not possible because of a short-
   notice PCS assignment of current occupant, consider the following options, depending on
   local conditions:
       4.5.1.1. Hold the unit vacant up to 30 days for the first member on the waiting list who is
       physically present at the installation and has accepted the housing.
       4.5.1.2. Offer a unit to applicants on the waiting list, in succession, until the unit is
       accepted.
   4.5.2. Members may exercise a turndown option for any reason and a turndown is assessed.
   Bypass members on the waiting list who do not accept the offer for reasons beyond their
   control (fulfill a lease commitment or when given a short notice of housing availability) and
   do not assess a turndown. For members under lease, do not bypass more than 1 year or the
   term of the lease, whichever occurs first. This bypassing provision does not apply to personal
   situations, such as a home sale. To ensure compliance and maintain program integrity, the
   Housing Flight Chief must review documentation to support bypassing member.
       4.5.2.1. Except for incumbents of K&E positions, personnel with approved hardships
       and personnel on TLA, members may exercise their option to turn down a FH unit. A
       member is given 1 duty day to accept or decline the unit. Apply the following rules to
       turndown options:
           4.5.2.1.1. Offer the unit to the next member on the waiting list.
           4.5.2.1.2. Do not remove members from the waiting list when exercising their
           turndown option for the first time.
           4.5.2.1.3. Remove members from the waiting list when they refuse housing the
           second time and do not allow them to reapply for 90 days unless the waiting list is
           exhausted.
           4.5.2.1.4. (Added-JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURST) K&E                      personnel    are
           encouraged to clearly outline to the privatized housing contractor when they will be
 54                    AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


           ready to move-in, since they immediately go to the top of the wait list in their
           category and may be offered a unit immediately. K&E personnel cannot turn down a
           unit they are being offered regardless of the location on the Joint Base if the unit is
           within their respective grade category or as defined in 2.20.2.2.2. and/or 2.20.2.2.3.
           4.5.2.1.5. (Added-JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURST) Any member in the grade
           of O-4 through O-6 or E-9, whose status changes from target tenant to non-target
           tenant (as defined in AFI 32-6007, Privatized Family Housing, dated 21 Jun 2005
           paragraph 4.2.13) will be required to sign a lease addendum. This addendum notifies
           the affected member that they may be required to move out of their home if it is
           needed for an individual who is Designated/K&E. Once notified, the member will be
           given 30 days to vacate and either relocate to the first available non-designated unit in
           their rank band; or if no housing is available in that band, to the next available unit
           closest to their rank band. All other subjects, situations or issues not covered under
           this supplement are outlined in Air Force Instruction 32-6001, Family Housing
           Management, dated 21 August 2006.
   4.5.3. Members who relocate from one on-base FH unit to another at the same installation
   must complete the move within 5 duty days.
   4.5.4. Record assignments in ACES and on printed version of ACES-generated AF IMT
   1326 and complete the following applicable forms at the time of occupancy and maintain in
   the resident housing folder:
            AF FORM 227, Quarters Condition Inspection Report
            AF IMT 228, Furnishings Custody Receipt and Condition Report
            AF IMT 3505, Condition of Occupancy for Military Family Housing
            AF IMT 3506, Customer Initial and Final Evaluation of Quarters Inspection
            (voluntary by member)
4.6. Assignment Priorities. Assign when member has at least 6 months retainability at the
installation. Assign eligible members and their dependents from the top of the waiting list (freeze
zone) in descending order to adequate housing according to the following priorities:
   4.6.1. Personnel in Designated Positions. Give precedence to incumbents of SCPs,
   Command and K&E positions and place at the top of the waiting list including the freeze
   zone without displacing members with a firm housing commitment (paragraph 2.20).
   4.6.2. Personnel With Approved Hardship. With written approval from the Commander,
   assign housing as an out-of-turn assignment for hardship conditions. Assign member to the
   next uncommitted unit in the appropriate grade and bedroom category to satisfy the
   requirement and do not allow a turndown option. Only the Commander or delegated
   representative may approve hardship requests (paragraph 1.6.9.2).
   4.6.3. Members Assigned or Attached for Duty at the Installation. This priority includes
   eligible personnel assigned to units, organizations and detachments or any Service personnel
   such as recruiters and Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC), who are:
       4.6.3.1. Located on or attached to the installation for housing support.
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                          55


       4.6.3.2. Located in the vicinity or within commuting distance of the installation, when an
       ISA includes housing support with the host installation. NOTE: When an AF
       installation provides housing support to another Service, AF housing policy takes
       precedence over other Service policy.
       4.6.3.3. ID Member assigned duty away from a military area where the parent Service
       cannot reasonably provide support facilities (such as housing). The installation with FH
       nearest the ID site provides FH, unless another installation within commuting distance
       (either 60 minutes or 20 miles) consents to a transfer of the responsibility.
4.7. Foreign OCONUS Mandatory Assignments. AF policy is to rely on local communities
first to provide adequate housing; however, installation commanders at foreign OCONUS
locations only may require personnel to live in on-base housing for force protection and mission
essential purposes. To avoid underutilizing government-controlled housing, the Commander may
also institute mandatory assignments for a 6-month period for the following housing categories:
   4.7.1. Long-Term Leased Units. If mandatory assignments do not achieve the AF occupancy
   goal of 98 percent within 6 months, renegotiate the lease based on current housing
   requirements and divest underutilized units through attrition.
   4.7.2. Government Housing Provided by Host Nation. Review historical occupancy rates
   and determine an appropriate occupancy rate based on current housing requirements. If
   mandatory assignment does not achieve the revised occupancy rate within 6 months, develop
   a strategy to divest underutilized housing.
4.8. Personal Preference Options. When a wide variance in style, type, location, age or design
of adequate housing exists, the Commander may permit personal preference options for the type
of FH member desires. Offer members housing consistent with their recorded preference. Offer
members expressing no housing preference any house that becomes available for assignment
consistent with their grade and family composition. Guidance follows for this option:
   4.8.1. The Housing Flight Chief recommends type and extent of personal preference options
   for Commander approval.
   4.8.2. Record approved options in a base supplement to this AFI.
   4.8.3. Members may exercise this option when they apply for FH or when they arrive at the
   installation and may change their preference at any time. Although a preference may not be
   changed in lieu of a turndown, members with an assessed turndown may change their options
   before being offered a second FH unit.
   4.8.4. Administer personal preference options within existing waiting list policies and do not
   establish a separate waiting list to accommodate this provision. Update ACES with approved
   options and maintain option preferences on each member in ACES. Members with a
   preference remain on the waiting list and are bypassed until a FH unit meeting their
   preference is available. Members exercising this option are not notified of other available
   housing, except members receiving TLA are notified because they are required to accept
   available adequate housing or forfeit their TLA.
   4.8.5. The Commander should consider discontinuing personal preference options when
   occupancy rates drop below the AF goal of 98 percent, except if the low occupancy rate is
   related to assignment to surplus housing.

                                              Chapter 5

                             HOUSING CIVILIAN PERSONNEL

5.1. Authority. Commanders may provide housing to eligible civilian employees when one of
the following criteria is met:
   5.1.1. When civilian employees are K&E and are required to live on base as a condition of
   employment (5 U.S.C. 5911, 5 U.S.C. 5912 and OMB Circular A-45) and the position is
   identified in a base supplement to this AFI.
   5.1.2. In OCONUS areas when appropriate and adequate housing, support services and
   facilities do not exist, are not readily available in the local community or may not be used
   without restrictions (DoDD 1400.6).
   5.1.3. When housing is excess to the needs of military personnel assigned or attached to the
   installation or to an adjacent installation (5 U.S.C. 5911).
5.2. Eligibility. Establish procedures with the local civilian personnel flight (CPF) to verify
civilian employee eligibility. Except for K&E civilians, occupancy of FH is limited to 5
consecutive years at any location. When both spouses are DoD employees at the same or
adjacent installations and both are eligible for FH, they jointly decide whose eligibility to use but
are not eligible for FH at both installations. Refer to Table 5.1 for a comparison of military and
civilian grades.
5.3. Pro Rata Distribution:
   5.3.1. Pro rata distribution is based on total population of eligible military and civilian
   personnel, without regard to housing categories or size of the units (number of bedrooms)
   required. Count civilians residing in housing regardless of how long they have resided in
   housing. However, do not count civilians as eligible if they have terminated housing as a
   result of the 5-year rule or if they have been served notice of termination as a result of the 5-
   year rule but are in housing pending relocation. Use the following formula for computing the
   pro rata share:
                         Eligible Civilians                × Housing Assets = Pro rata Share
                  Total Eligible (Military and Civilian)
   5.3.2. To determine the number of housing assets exclude FH units designated for SCP,
   command and K&E positions and exclude the incumbents from the total personnel count.
5.4. Termination. When there is a waiting list, issue 60-day mandatory termination notices to
civilians who have occupied housing for over 5 years (except K&E personnel). When local
community housing is adequate and sufficient to house civilians, at the Commander’s discretion,
issue termination notices to civilians who have occupied FH 5 years or longer. When directed,
the move is at government expense.
5.5. Rental Charges. See paragraph 11.8 for collection of rental charges as reimbursements to
the MFH account.
   5.5.1. CONUS (includes Alaska, Hawaii and US territories). At CONUS locations, where
   eligible civilian employees are not authorized an LQA funded with APF:
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                          57


       5.5.1.1. Eligible civilian employees, who are offered and elect to occupy government-
       managed housing (includes leased housing), must pay a monthly rental charge based on a
       fair market rental rate.
       5.5.1.2. The fair market rental rates include heat, electricity, fuel, furniture and other
       services. See OMB Circular A-45 for specific processes to determine fair market value.
       If assigned government-managed housing, the rental charge is a reimbursement to the FH
       account (AFI 65-601, Section 21E).
   5.5.2. OCONUS (See the defined terms “eligible civilian employee” and “DoD-sponsored
   civilian employee”):
       5.5.2.1. At OCONUS locations, where eligible civilian employees are authorized LQA
       funded with APF, and who are offered and elect to occupy government-managed housing
       are not authorized to continue to receive LQA. No further charges are required from the
       civilian employee or their agency.
       5.5.2.2. At OCONUS locations, where eligible civilian employees are not authorized
       LQA funded with APF, and who are offered and elect to occupy government-managed
       housing, must pay a monthly rental charge based on the established LQA rate of the
       equivalent grade. If assigned government-managed housing, the rental charge is a
       reimbursement to the MFH account (AFI 65-601, Section 21E).
       5.5.2.3. At OCONUS locations, a DoD-sponsored civilian employee offered and
       assigned government- managed housing must pay a rental charge based on the LQA rate
       of equivalent DoD civilian employee. If assigned government-managed housing, the
       rental charge is a reimbursement to the MFH account (AFI 65-601, Section 21E).
5.6. Household Goods (HHG) Storage. Unless authorized and funded by the employing
organization, do not authorize government-paid HHG storage incidental to civilians occupying
government housing.
5.7. American Red Cross (ARC) Positions. ARC positions include the Regional Manager,
Senior Station Manager, Station Manager and Assistant Manager. The Commander may assign
FH under the following conditions:
   5.7.1. In CONUS, ARC employees are housed on the same basis as DoD eligible civilians
   and assessed a fair market rental charge.
   5.7.2. In OCONUS areas, ARC employees in the positions listed in Table 5.1 may be
   assigned to FH without rental charge. All other ARC full-time personnel pay a rental charge
   equal to the LQA of a DoD civilian employee of equivalent grade.

                                          Chapter 6

                            RETENTION AND TERMINATION

6.1. Retention of Assigned Housing. The Air Force intent is that eligible members keep
housing for the duration of their tour at the installation unless there are reasons that justify
reassignment or termination. Requests to retain FH are submitted in writing with supporting
documentation to the Commander through the Housing Flight Chief. If the Commander has
delegated approval authority, the Housing Flight Chief may approve retention requests.
Disapproval authority is the responsibility of the Commander, but may be delegated to mission
support or equivalent level group commander (paragraph 1.6.9). Members and their families
are usually allowed to retain FH for longer than normal occupancy periods under the following
conditions:
   6.1.1. Member in Missing Status. Dependent of a member who is officially reported in
   missing status (includes members who are captured, interned and involuntarily detained
   foreign OCONUS) are permitted to retain housing for up to 12 months. The member’s BAH
   is forfeited during occupancy of dependent.
   6.1.2. Member Incarcerated (Jailed or Imprisoned). Dependents may request to retain
   housing when the member is entitled to BAH/OHA during the period of incarceration. The
   Commander determines approval and the retention period.
   6.1.3. TDY. A member may retain housing at the home station while on TDY for duty or
   training.
   6.1.4. PCS With TDY En Route (does not apply to OCONUS areas). Member may retain
   housing during period of a TDY while attending Service or training school (PCS) for a
   period of 1 year or less until dependents commence travel on member’s PCS orders.
   6.1.5. PCS From CONUS to Accompanied OCONUS Tour. If concurrent travel of
   dependents is disapproved and the anticipated travel delay for dependents is less than 20
   weeks, dependents may retain housing for 20 weeks after member departs. NOTE: Member
   must agree to serve an accompanied tour and apply for command sponsorship for dependents
   to travel to the new duty station.
   6.1.6. Transfer to Hospital. A hospitalized member may retain FH for the period of
   hospitalization or a period agreed on by the Commander, the Installation Surgeon General
   and Housing Flight Chief.
   6.1.7. Member Dies While on Active Duty. Dependents of a member who dies on active
   duty, who occupy adequate FH other than on a rental basis, on the date of the member’s
   death, may retain housing without charge for a period of 365 days (37 U.S.C. 403).
       6.1.7.1. The Commander may extend occupancy beyond 365 days on a case-by-case
       basis, but dependents must pay a rental charge equal to the equivalent BAH of member.
   6.1.8. Completion of School Term. Commanders may approve retention of housing for
   dependent to complete a school term for student to graduate or if student would lose credit if
   required to withdraw or transfer (paragraph 6.3.8).
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                       63


   6.1.9. Dependents Unable to Accompany Sponsor Due to Medical or School Delay.
   Dependents denied travel to an accompanied foreign OCONUS area due to lack of medical
   or school facilities in the foreign OCONUS location may retain FH for a period determined
   by the Commander. Member requests approval on AF IMT 1466, Family Member’s
   Medical and Education Clearance for Travel.
   6.1.10. Educational Leave of Absence Program (ELAP). While enrolled in ELAP members
   may retain FH on a space available basis (paragraph 2.28).
   6.1.11. Unaccompanied Families. Dependents of member assigned to a UDR, home-basing
   tour or follow-on assignment who occupy government FH including leased units when the
   sponsor departs, may retain housing until the sponsor returns or reports to the next PDS.
   Commanders may approve extended retention when the sponsor extends their UDR tour. FH
   is terminated within 60 days of member’s return from the UDR location. This provision
   includes mil-to-mil members with no dependents. The Commander may also encourage
   residents to retain FH for the duration of the sponsor’s UDR tour.
6.2. Retention for Hardships. Commanders may approve a written request for housing
retention to relieve hardship (defined in Attachment 1).
   6.2.1. Commanders may permit members or dependents to retain FH based on hardship for
   periods shown in Table 6.1 and may extend the periods on a case-by-case basis. The
   occupant must pay rent as stated in Table 6.1. This does not apply to transition assistance
   benefit. As provided in 10 U.S.C. 1147, transition benefits may not continue more than 365
   days after the date of separation.

6.3. Termination of Family Housing (FH). Military members may voluntarily terminate FH
for any reason after completing a mandatory 1-year tenancy. Members terminating FH give the
Housing Flight at least 40 days notice and must terminate occupancy of FH under the following
circumstances. Refer to Chapter 11 for moves funded by the government and moves for which
the member is responsible:
64                   AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


  6.3.1. Waiver to Mandatory Residency. Commanders may waive the 1-year mandatory
  residency requirement when in the best interest of the Air Force or when a hardship exists.
  Waiver approval may be delegated to the BCE or Housing Flight Chief. Disapproval may be
  delegated to mission support or equivalent level group commander (paragraph 1.6).
  6.3.2. PCS. A member who receives PCS orders to another installation must terminate
  housing before departing, except those with authorized retention.
  6.3.3. Enlisted Member Commissioned as an Officer. An enlisted member who accepts a
  commission and active duty, with no interruption of active Military Service, relocates to
  officer housing unless the member has less than 6 months retainability at the installation.
  Move will be at government expense.
  6.3.4. Commissioned Officer Who Remains on Active Duty in Enlisted Status. A
  commissioned officer who is separated and re-enlists or who assumes an enlisted grade
  relocates to enlisted housing unless the member has less than 6 months retainability at the
  installation. Move will be at government expense.
  6.3.5. Family Separation. When a member no longer lives with dependents or dependents
  no longer live with the member, the member must terminate housing within 30 days from
  date of separation. Move is at government expense, but PDLA is not payable (JFTR,
  U5630B, and paragraph 11.7).
  6.3.6. Adverse Conduct or Behavior. Commanders may require a member to terminate FH
  with 30 days notice when member or dependent’s conduct or behavior is contrary to accepted
  standards or adverse to military discipline. Fully document and retain the termination notice
  on file for a minimum of 1 year. Move is at government expense, but PDLA is not payable
  (JFTR, U5630B).
     6.3.6.1. When the member fails to comply with the AF family child care policies, the

     expense, but PDLA is not payable (JFTR, U5630B).
  6.3.7. Destruction or Abuse of Property. Commanders may terminate FH with a 30-day
  notice when the member or dependents are responsible for willful, malicious or negligent
  abuse or destruction of property. Fully document and retain termination on file for a
  minimum of 1 year. Move is at government expense, but PDLA is not payable (JFTR,
  U5630B).
  6.3.8. Separation or Retirement. A member who is separating or retiring must terminate
  housing no later than the date of separation or retirement from active duty. The Housing
  Flight Chief (with delegated approval authority) may approve retention of 60 days to relieve
  a hardship that occurs after member applies for separation or retirement when conditions are
  beyond their control (provision in paragraph 6.1.8 excepted). MAJCOM approval is
  required for extensions beyond the 60 days. Separated and retired members must pay a daily
  rental charge equal to one-thirtieth of the combined BAH or OHA. Rental fees may not be
  waived.
  6.3.9. Death of Qualifying Dependent or Military Spouse. Members terminate FH within 90
  days following the death of a military spouse or a family member who qualified them for
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                           65


   BAH at the with-dependent rate. The Commander may approve retention beyond the 90
   days.
6.4. Termination Procedures. Members should give at least 40 days advance notice of intent
to terminate FH upon PCS, separation or retirement. The following procedures apply:
   6.4.1. The occupant provides one copy of PCS, separation, retirement, or other orders to
   housing management.
   6.4.2. Use ACES to manage terminations, generate AF Form 594, Application to Start,
   Stop or Change Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAQ) or Dependency Redetermination,
   establish required inspections and track results. AF IMT 1326 documents termination
   milestones, which enables monthly reconciliation of ACES data.
   6.4.3. When the occupant has met clearance requirements and settled property accounts
   promptly relieve the resident of responsibility and terminate the housing assignment.
   6.4.4. Prepare AF Form 594 to notify the FSO of a change in housing status. The member's
   BAH or OHA is reinstated upon satisfactorily clearing FH or physical departure from the
   PDS, whichever occurs first. Failure to provide appropriate advance notice of termination of
   housing may affect member’s BAH start date (DoDR 7000.14, Volume 7A, Chapter 26,
   Table 26-6, Date to Start BAH - Members w/Dependents).
   6.4.5. DoD Civilians. Issue a dated and signed clearance document as evidence of housing
   termination. Provide one copy of the termination document to the FSO and the servicing
   CPF, as appropriate.
6.5. Involuntary Relocation Between Housing Units. When involuntary relocations are
required to complete emergency repairs and major renovation projects, the Commander directs
residents to relocate to other FH or to community housing. Unless compelling circumstances
exist, do not involuntarily relocate residents for redesignation or redistribution of FH. Instead,
redistribute housing vacated by normal attrition. When occupants are directed to relocate, offer
the next available uncommitted unit appropriate for their grade and family size and no turndown
option is allowed. The move is at government expense (paragraph 11.10).
6.6. Family Housing (FH) Change of Occupancy (COM) Inspection Standards:
   6.6.1. The baseline inspection standard is that each component of the housing unit fulfills the
   function for which it was designed. For all items listed on the AF FORM 227, Quarters
   Condition Inspection Report ensure proper operation, condition, safety, and acceptable
   appearance (no noticeable defects) of mechanical and HVAC systems, appliances and
   equipment, utility connections, interior and exterior systems and surfaces (painted and
   unpainted), window and door systems, floor coverings and subfloor material, integrity of
   roof, garage door and opener, walkways, railings, driveway, patio, drainage systems,
   fencing/gates, and mailbox. Interior or exterior items not listed on the AF FORM 227, may
   be added and assumed to require inspection IAW COM inspection standards.
   6.6.2. Items past their planned lifecycle need not be replaced if not visibly damaged or
   excessively worn and continue to meet their functional needs without frequent repair.
   6.6.3. Items may be replaced if damaged, excessively worn or require frequent repairs,
   regardless of their planned lifecycle.
 66                   AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


       6.6.3.1. Use standardized cleaning requirements for all residents and make sure the
       resident accomplishes DoD-mandated cleaning listed on the reverse of AF FORM 227
       (DoDM 4165-63).
       6.6.3.2. The government performs final cleaning of portions of the FH unit scheduled to
       be repaired or replaced and required cleaning not included on the reverse of AF FORM
       227. The government also performs final cleaning of FH units in geographical locations
       where TLA is authorized to reduce TLA for departing members. See AFI 65-601,
       Volume I, Budget Guidance and Procedures (Chapter 21) and AFMAN 65-604,
       Appropriation Symbols and Budget Codes, for turnover maintenance, cleaning and
       clearing FH units when occupants change.
       6.6.3.3. Schedule a reinspection of a failed final inspection at the earliest mutually
       agreed date to prevent disrupting the member’s scheduled departure. Do not identify new
       inspection items except obvious defects for which the member is responsible that have
       occurred since the most recent inspection.
       6.6.3.4. Arrange for a commercial contractor to clean and repair occupant damages in
       abandoned units and seek reimbursement from the member using DD Form 139, Pay
       Adjustment Authorization.
   6.6.4. Self-Help Work. When authorized self-help work is performed, occupants are
   responsible for returning the unit and surrounding grounds to the original configuration,
   unless housing management approves transfer of the self-help project to the next occupant.
   Residents may donate and the AF may accept self-help improvements when workmanship
   and aesthetics meet acceptable construction standards.
6.7. Family Housing (FH) Inspections. Three inspections associated with occupancy of FH
are the initial, pretermination and final. The member and a housing inspector jointly perform
inspections. The inspector and the occupant sign and each retain a copy of AF FORM 227 and
AF IMT 228 if government-owned furniture is provided. Accomplish inspections as follows:
   6.7.1. Initial Inspection. Perform the initial inspection in the housing unit, when possible,
   at time of occupancy or as soon as possible thereafter. Record the condition of the FH unit,
   furnishings, equipment, appliances and grounds on AF FORM 227, and AF IMT 228 if
   applicable, according to instructions on the reverse of the form. Advise new residents that if
   the condition of the housing unit, appliances, equipment and government furnishings differ
   from the entries recorded on the AF FORM 227, the resident must submit the discrepancies
   in writing to the Housing Management Office within 15 days of the move-in date to preclude
   an assumption of occupant damage. Complete AF IMT 3505 during the initial inspection.
   Brief residents on issues, such as, but not limited to:
       6.7.1.1. Installation standardized housing brochure (provide copy).
       6.7.1.2. Appliances and mechanical systems.
       6.7.1.3. Minor M&R, such as replacing light bulbs and heat/air conditioner (AC) filters,
       securing door stops, replacing sink stoppers, cleaning stove burners, plunging
       toilets/sinks and basic insect control.
       6.7.1.4. Cleaning standards (reverse of AF FORM 227).
       6.7.1.5. Grounds care.

      6.7.1.6. Self-Help Program and Self-Help Store.
      6.7.1.7. Refuse and recycle.
      6.7.1.8. Telephone numbers for emergencies and local services.
      6.7.1.9. Environmental hazards, as applicable (lead-based paint, mold, asbestos, radon).
   6.7.2. Pretermination Inspection. Perform the pretermination inspection 30-45 days before
   the resident vacates FH to facilitate scheduling COM and other repairs. Compare the
   condition of the unit to the initial inspection recorded on AF FORM 227. Inform terminating
   residents of their responsibilities for damaged or missing property and how to make
   restitution. If the resident does not agree to repair or reimburse for occupant damage or if
   damage is over $500, request an ROS. The ROS process may be disregarded when the value
   is less than $500 and the member is willing to pay for the damage (paragraph 2.8).
   6.7.3. Final Inspection. The purpose of the final inspection is to clear the member of
   responsibility for the unit.
      6.7.3.1. Use standardized cleaning requirements for all residents and make sure the
      resident accomplishes DoD-mandated cleaning listed on the reverse of AF FORM 227
      (DoDM 4165-63).
      6.7.3.2. The government performs final cleaning of portions of the FH unit scheduled to
      be repaired or replaced and required cleaning not included on the reverse of AF FORM
      227. The government also performs final cleaning of FH units in geographical locations
      where TLA is authorized to reduce TLA for departing members. See AFI 65-601,
      Volume I, Budget Guidance and Procedures (Chapter 21) and AFMAN 65-604,
      Appropriation Symbols and Budget Codes, for turnover maintenance, cleaning and
      clearing FH units when occupants change.
      6.7.3.3. Schedule a reinspection of a failed final inspection at the earliest mutually
      agreed date to prevent disrupting the member’s scheduled departure. Do not identify new
      inspection items except obvious defects for which the member is responsible that have
      occurred since the most recent inspection.
      6.7.3.4. Arrange for a commercial contractor to clean and repair occupant damages in
      abandoned units and seek reimbursement from the member using DD Form 139, Pay
      Adjustment Authorization.
   6.7.4. Self-Help Work. When authorized self-help work is performed, occupants are
   responsible for returning the unit and surrounding grounds to the original configuration,
   unless housing management approves transfer of the self-help project to the next occupant.
   Residents may donate and the AF may accept self-help improvements when workmanship
   and aesthetics meet acceptable construction standards.
6.8. Customer Evaluations. Provide each customer with an AF IMT 3506 or locally developed
comment form to measure customer service. Request customers evaluate the service they
received during the inspection process and return the form to the HMO. The Housing Asset
Manager uses the feedback to improve inspection processes.

   7.1.1. Adequate housing is required within a commuting distance of either 60 minutes or 20
   miles of the installation.
   7.1.2. DoD personnel are entitled to an equal opportunity to reside in housing free from
   discriminatory practices. When a resident reports circumstances that appear suspicious of
   illegal discrimination, the Housing Flight Chief immediately initiates a review in cooperation
   with installation and community agencies (Attachment 3).
7.2. Housing Services. Offer complete referral services and a full range of relocation assistance
and monitor community housing referral and relocation activities to make sure they provide

   occurred. Refer to Attachment 3 for investigative procedures for housing discrimination.
   7.8.3. If the complainant does not locate adequate housing after a reasonable time because of
   discriminatory practices in the community, the Commander may approve priority assignment
   to FH for the complainant.
7.9. Community Housing Inspections. Inspect rental properties, whether listed in ACES or
AHRN (as deployment) to determine adequacy. Record inspections and applicable comments in

   suitability of the housing based on environmental, health or safety considerations, seek
 72                    AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


   permission from the landlord and enter the property for inspection. Remove property from
   viewing in AHRN and ACES that does not meet adequacy standards.
   7.9.2. In OCONUS areas where rental property standards differ significantly from the US
   inspect all rental properties before listing or occupancy, as required, for protection of
   members.
   7.9.3. Air Force Joint Instruction (AFJI) 31-213, Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Boards
   and Off-Installation Liaison and Operations, provides guidance on placing a housing facility
   off-limits for such reasons as safety, health or morale (as distinguished from imposing
   restrictive sanctions for discriminatory practices).
7.10. Standards of Conduct. Familiarize military and civilian Housing Flight employees with
DoDR 5500.7, Joint Ethics Regulation (JER), and advise the employees to make sure business
associations or financial interests are conducted without suspicion of partiality and to avoid any
action, whether or not specifically prohibited, that might result in or create the appearance of:
   7.10.1. Using public office for private gain.
   7.10.2. Giving preferential treatment to any person or business associate.
   7.10.3. Making government decisions outside official channels.

                                           Chapter 8

                  PROPERTY MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR (M&R)

8.1. Maintenance and Repair (M&R) Standards. Maintain FH units according to AF
standards in The Air Force Family Housing Guide for Planning, Programming, Design and
Construction. The BCE and Housing Flight Chief ensure AF standards through routine
preventive maintenance programs, accomplishing M&R according to accepted engineering
practices, experience and manufacturer recommendations and by fostering an attitude of home
ownership among residents.
   8.1.1. Inform residents to promptly notify the service provider when the FH structure,
   equipment or fixture is defective, broken, damaged or malfunctioning, and that they must
   allow entry into the housing unit for necessary repairs. Schedule routine work in occupied
   units with minimum disruption to occupants.
   8.1.2. The service provider completes urgent or emergency work within a time period
   consistent with the degree of urgency and schedules nonemergency and routine work in the
   most economical and efficient manner. Maintenance personnel must also take proper
   precautions to protect the resident’s personal property and leave the worksite clean and
   orderly. To reduce disruption to the occupant, accomplish maintenance tasks during COM,
   when possible.
   8.1.3. Identify requirements to improve or replace FH units, infrastructure, playgrounds and
   other common grounds in the housing area IAW HCP priorities and accomplish the work
   IAW AFI 32-6002 and program guidance letters. Inspect playgrounds annually and maintain
   according to standards in the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Publication No.
   325, Handbook for Public Play- ground Safety.
8.2. Change of Occupancy Maintenance (COM). COM is minor M&R required to make the
FH unit ready for the next occupant. Identify repairs during the pretermination and final
inspection. Since COM costs are excluded from the $20,000 M&R limitation in FH (non-
GOQs), limit COM repairs to minor M&R, carpet and drapery cleaning and replacement, floor
refinishing, interior painting and replacing filters. Maintain COM maintenance start and stop
dates in ACES to ensure accuracy of the ACES-generated FH Occupancy and Utilization Report.
8.3. Maintenance and Repair (M&R). The following are examples of minor and major M&R
when performed during COM:
   8.3.1. Minor M&R:
            Interior painting
            Floor and wall repair
            Restoring ceiling and wall finishes
            Electrical and plumbing fixture repair
            Landscaping and planting trees and shrubs
   8.3.2. Major M&R:
            Restoration or replacement of structural members in the original locations, such as
            repairing or replacing foundation, roof, exterior structure or wall, exterior painting,
 74                    AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


             interior partition, electrical, plumbing, heating ventilations and air conditioning.
8.4. Minor Alterations. Minor alteration is construction or improvement (new) work typically
performed in support of an M&R project and funded with FH M&R funds (P-722). However,
some circumstances may warrant use of minor alteration without repair. Minor alteration work
installs or constructs systems, or features that do not currently exist or changes systems, features
or spaces that already exist. Use this authority for interior and exterior work consistent with AF
standards. Do not use this authority to increase the size of any unit or increase the number of
rooms in any unit.
   8.4.1. Replacement of functioning or serviceable material, system or component systems
   before the end of their useful life is classified as minor alteration. Replacement of failed or
   unserviceable materials, systems or components with contemporary standard components or
   materials, consistent with local standards, is not minor alteration if justified by a life-cycle
   analysis. Replacement of failed or unserviceable materials, systems or components with an
   upgraded material, component or system that exceeds contemporary standards or local
   standards is classified as minor alteration. Anti-Terrorism/ Force Protection (AT/FP)
   requirements supported by documented vulnerability assessments are excluded from minor
   alteration cost limits (AFI 32-6002).
   8.4.2. Examples of minor alteration work are:
             Installing new planting areas or borders which are not currently installed.
             Replacing carpet with wood flooring or tile (even if the carpet is due for
             replacement).
             Replacing laminate countertop with an upgraded surface such as Corian or granite.
             Installing new outlets and/or lighting which is not currently installed.
             Replacing window air conditioning unit with ducted system.
8.5. Maintenance of Common Areas. The installation maintains grounds in common areas of
FH. For individual units, installation responsibility is limited to erosion control, tree surgery,
screening and overall attractiveness except for units with an approved waiver (paragraph
2.14.1). Use low maintenance shrubbery and hedges that do not require trimming.
8.6. Maintenance of Government-Installed Carpet. Clean government-installed carpet, as
needed, IAW the AFCEE carpet guide, the most current ETL and manufacturer instructions to
preserve the quality and life of the carpet (www.afcesa.af.mil) (paragraph 2.26).

                                            Chapter 9

                        FAMILY HOUSING (FH) REQUIREMENTS

9.1. Air Force Family Housing Master Plan (FHMP). The AF FHMP provides a corporate,
requirements-based housing investment strategy that integrates and prioritizes traditional
construction and O&M funding with private sector financing in a single road map. The road
map identifies the most cost-effective investment option for each installation (use of privatization
authorities or traditional MILCON) to meet its FH requirements consistent with congressional
and OSD constraints and directives (USAF Family Housing Guide for Planning, Programming,
Design, and Construction).
9.2. Housing Requirements and Market Analysis (HRMA). DoD requires the local
community to be the first source for satisfying housing requirements of military families. DoD
requires Military Services to determine requirements based on a thorough analysis of the local
community’s ability to house military families. To meet this requirement, the AF uses the
HRMA. The HRMA assesses the type and amount of community housing, including privatized
housing on and off base, that satisfies DoD suitability criteria. Housing constructed with
appropriated funds or privatization authorities can be used to meet housing demand not satisfied
by the local community. The HRMA should be conducted every 3 years.
9.3. Housing Community Profile (HCP). The HCP provides a long-range plan for planning,
programming, design and construction of improvements, replacement and privatized FH. The
HCP is key to the Whole-House/Whole Neighborhood Program. It is the justification for housing
design projects submitted to HQ USAF/A7CH by the installation/MAJCOM. The AF has
completed HCPs for all installations with a housing inventory. Updates are accomplished
approximately every 3 years, depending on the installation mission requirement. The HCP
provides assessments of FH current conditions, describes actions and associated costs to update
FH to modern standards and determines the best investment decision (improvement or
replacement) for each installation.
9.4. Installation Family Housing Master Plan (IFHMP). The IFHMP incorporates data from
the HRMA and HCP and adjusts the HCP data to reflect the beginning of the Fiscal Year
Defense Planning (FYDP). This adjustment assumes projects programmed in years prior to the
beginning of the FYDP are complete and future investment funding requirements start with the
beginning of the FYDP. The IFHMP also documents the O&M funding requirements including
operations, utilities, leases, privatization support costs and sustainment costs, including real
property maintenance activities (RPMA) and real property maintenance by contract (RPMC).
All of the O&M costs, except RPMC, are based on actual housing accounting records. The
sustainment RPMC costs are estimated by the real property maintenance (RPM) model. The
RPM model uses results of the Condition Assessment Matrix (CAM) inspections conducted to
support the HCP to predict the timing and cost of major repair/replacement for housing
components and infrastructure and community systems.
9.5. Economic Analysis (EA). An EA is required for:
   9.5.1. New FH construction and replacement projects.
   9.5.2. FH support facility construction projects with a total cost of over $2,000,000.
 76                   AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


   9.5.3. Improvement projects when the most expensive unit exceeds $50,000 ($60,000 for
   accessible handicapped units) multiplied by the local area cost factor, except foreign
   OCONUS locations. In foreign OCONUS locations, installations may not apply the area cost
   factor to increase the cost limit (AFI 32-6002).
   9.5.4. Prepare the EA IAW AFMAN 32-1089, Air Force Military Construction and Family
   Housing Economic Analysis Guide.
       9.5.4.1. Initiate the EA as early as practical during the project planning process and
       update when significant developments occur that would invalidate or significantly alter
       the conclusions. Document the EA to allow for complete replication, including costs
       traceable to their most basic input and unit of measure.
       9.5.4.2. Military Construction Project Data (DD Forms 1391), which are sent to OSD
       and Congress, must contain a summary of the EA results for the applicable project.
       9.5.4.3. The installation prepares and the MAJCOM certifies the EA. The methodology
       provides for cooperative analysis between the installation BCE and financial manager
       (FM), MAJCOM Civil Engineer and FM and HQ USAF/A7C and SAF/FM, and assures
       selection of the most cost-effective alternative.
9.6. Standards for Family Housing (FH). The goal of the Air Force is to provide its members
with the highest possible quality housing within legal limits. Congress has removed size
standards for FH, including GOQ (AFI 32-6002). Room sizes are specified in the Air Force
Family Housing Guide for Planning, Programming, Design and Construction.
9.7. Equitable Use of Housing Assets. Because changes in housing requirements reflect
changes to the base mission, force structure, population distribution and availability of
community housing, Commanders must (each January) reevaluate the distribution of existing FH
among categories in Table 4.1 to ensure equitable allocation (paragraphs 1.6.4 and 1.8.17).
9.8. Temporary Redistribution. The Commander considers temporary redistribution of FH
when an imbalance exists but circumstances do not warrant permanent redistribution and change
of property records. Do not use temporary redistribution when permanent redistribution is
clearly warranted.
   9.8.1. The Housing Flight Chief compares current distribution of FH assets with
   requirements using ACES-HM occupancy data and submits recommendations to the
   Commander.
   9.8.2. Consider the following to determine the need for temporary redistribution:
       9.8.2.1. Housing requirements within each category, by number of bedrooms, including
       current, projected and programmable changes.
       9.8.2.2. Recent or projected mission changes.
       9.8.2.3. Approved and programmed new construction for government, privatized and
       community housing.
       9.8.2.4. Separation of officer and enlisted family areas.
       9.8.2.5. Imbalance of waiting times among categories.
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                          77


   9.8.3. Make sure ACES reflects temporarily redistributed units by changing the current
   designation.
9.9. Permanent Redistribution: Permanently redistribute FH units in ACES and on real
property records to align units with requirements when evaluation shows a significant change in
the following conditions (paragraph 1.6.9.7):
   9.9.1. Base mission.
   9.9.2. Base population.
   9.9.3. Availability of government, privatized and community housing.
   9.9.4. Continued temporary redistribution to maintain equity among categories.
9.10. Conversions (Permanent Change in Use). Do not permanently convert FH identified on
real property records without prior approval of SAF/IEI.
   9.10.1. FH units determined to be surplus to installation requirements based on the current
   HRMA may be converted to other uses. Authorized conversions of surplus housing include:
       9.10.1.1. Adequate housing based on the current Housing Community Profile (HCP)
       Condition assessment matrix (CAM) score.
       9.10.1.2. Inadequate due to family housing functional suitability deficiencies, but
       otherwise adequate condition.
       9.10.1.3. If FH units are removed from the FH property records as a conversion, the
       appropriate base O&M account pays for the M&R of the converted unit.
       9.10.1.4. For surplus housing identified in the IFHMP, request permanent conversion.
       EXCEPTION: Housing for unaccompanied K&E personnel may be diverted.
   9.10.2. All other inadequate surplus housing may not be converted and must be disposed
   (paragraph 9.12).
   9.10.3. Follow guidance in AFI 32-9002 to request conversions and include information
   outlined in Attachment 4 to justify the conversion. Use AF IMT 123, Request for Changed
   Use of Real Property, to process and track approval of conversions of family housing (AFI
   32-9002, Use of Real Property Facilities).
   9.10.4. Follow AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare and Recreation
   (MWR) and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFIS), for funding conversions to
   MWR and NAF activities.
       9.10.4.1. FH funds may not be used to pay for any conversion costs. Appropriated funds
       are used for conversions to VQs and NAF pays for conversions to TLFs.
       9.10.4.2. As part of the conversion, units must meet standards necessary for the end-state
       use and yield at least a C-2 Installation Readiness Report rating.
   9.10.5. When FH units are removed from the FH property records as a conversion, no
   additional FH funds are authorized to be expended on the unit.
9.11. Diversions (Temporary Changes in Use). Diversions of nonsurplus FH is only
authorized for use as UH for K&E personnel.
78                   AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


  9.11.1. Diversion of surplus FH units is not authorized.
  9.11.2. MAJCOM Civil Engineers may approve diversion of nonsurplus FH to UH for K&E
  unaccompanied personnel only for up to 3 years and may delegate this specific authority to
  Commanders.
     9.11.2.1. Do not change AF Real Property Records for a diversion.
     9.11.2.2. Charge O&M costs to the FH account for diverted unit.
     9.11.2.3. Show the date diverted and nature of the temporary use in ACES.
  9.11.3. Foreign OCONUS bases follow appropriate guidelines for disposal of FH as
  stipulated in the SOFA and other host-nation governing documents.
  9.11.4. Only two categories of surplus housing (adequate and inadequate) are possible
  (based on the CAM score) and disposition will vary for each category.
  9.11.5. OSD guidance defines the occupancy requirements necessary to retain surplus
  housing. Use a 3-year average occupancy rate (100 minus the vacancy rate as calculated by
  ACES) to determine the average occupancy rate. Calculate twice per year (1 April and 1
  October) for the previous 3 years to account for seasonal variations. When historical ACES-
  HM data is not available, supplement with manual data.
  9.11.6. Surplus housing units are not eligible to receive programmed MILCON or
  programmed RPMC funds.
     9.11.6.1. Bases will receive no funding beyond RPMA for maintenance of surplus
     housing. M&R expenditures are limited to $3,800 per unit per fiscal year (FY). HQ
     USAF/A7C must approve per-unit expenditures in excess of this amount.
     9.11.6.2. MAJCOMs and installations track M&R costs for their surplus housing units.
     9.11.6.3. Send request to waive the $3,800 per-unit limit to HQ USAF/A7CH. Include:
         9.11.6.3.1. Unit description and type, unit address and year of construction or most
         recent whole house renovation, general construction and location.
         9.11.6.3.2. Indicate if the unit is surplus-adequate or surplus-inadequate and
         programmed disposal date.
         9.11.6.3.3. Description of M&R requirements that warrant supplemental funding and
         justification for repairs exceeding the $3,800 limit (storm damage, excessive wear,
         etc.) and an estimate of total costs for the entire year. Include a detailed M&R
         estimate sufficient to identify individual components of the work. State the required
         start date for the M&R work and an estimated performance period.
         9.11.6.3.4. State whether the work is routine or emergency and impact if waiver is
         not approved.
     9.11.6.4. Use MFH O&M funding to perform RPMC level work on surplus units under
     emergency conditions only (affecting life, health and safety), and when no other options
     exist to relocate families into adequate housing.
     9.11.6.5. Adequate surplus housing may be retained as long as the 3-year average
     occupancy rate is at least 97 percent.
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                          79


   9.11.7. MAJCOMs report progress to HQ USAF/A7CH quarterly (1 January, April, July,
   October) on disposing surplus FH and removing units from AF Real Property records.
       9.11.7.1. Track the following information: total housing inventory to include AF owned,
       privatized, leased and Section 801 leased units.
       9.11.7.2. Provide occupancy rate twice per year (April and October).
       9.11.7.3. Track the number of adequate and inadequate surplus units and the number of
       units removed from the real property records.
       9.11.7.4. Report FH units as surplus until the disposal action is complete and information
       is updated in ACES-RP (Real Property).
9.12. Surplus Housing. Units excess to the FH requirement as determined by the HRMA,
including government-owned and leased, and Section 801 housing, are considered surplus to the
installation requirement. Mandatory assignment of surplus housing is prohibited. For identified
surplus housing units the installation must develop a divestiture/disposal plan and forward to HQ
USAF/A7CH IAW provided guidance. Inadequate surplus housing must be disposed of by 1 Oct
2013 or as approved by AF/A7C. Once adequate surplus housing no longer meets occupancy
requirements for continued use, disposal must occur within 18 months.
   9.12.1. Identify surplus housing by unit type and neighborhood. Consider economic
   investment, condition (dispose of worst first based on CAM score), location, size and
   occupancy. Also, consider the community environment by reducing density and maintaining
   neighborhood continuity. Houses on the National Register of Historical Places and those
   eligible for the Register may be declared surplus.
   9.12.2. Bases must actively manage surplus unit inventory to ensure proper accountability.
   Annotate surplus units in the ACES-HM.
   9.12.3. Foreign OCONUS bases follow appropriate guidelines for disposal of FH as
   stipulated in the SOFA and other host-nation governing documents.
   9.12.4. Only two categories of surplus housing (adequate and inadequate) are possible
   (based on the CAM score) and disposition will vary for each category.
   9.12.5. 2 Adequate surplus housing may be retained as long as the 3-year average occupancy
   rate is at least 97 percent.
       9.12.5.1. Use a 3-year average occupancy rate (100 minus the vacancy rate as calculated
       by ACES) to determine the average occupancy rate. Calculate twice per year (1 April
       and 1 October) for the previous 3 years to account for seasonal variations. If historical
       ACES-HM data is unavailable, supplement with manual occupancy data.
   9.12.6. Surplus housing units are not eligible to receive programmed MILCON or
   programmed RPMC funds.
       9.12.6.1. Bases will receive no funding beyond RPMA for maintenance of surplus
       housing. M&R expenditures are limited to $3,800 per unit per fiscal year (FY). HQ
       USAF/A7C must approve per-unit expenditures in excess of this amount.
       9.12.6.2. MAJCOMs and installations track M&R costs for their surplus housing units.
       9.12.6.3. Send request to waive the $3,800 per-unit limit to HQ USAF/A7CH. Include:
 80                   AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


          9.12.6.3.1. Unit description and type, unit address and year of construction or most
          recent whole house renovation, general construction and location.
          9.12.6.3.2. Indicate if the unit is surplus-adequate or surplus-inadequate and
          programmed disposal date.
          9.12.6.3.3. Description of M&R requirements that warrant supplemental funding and
          justification for repairs exceeding the $3,800 limit (storm damage, excessive wear,
          etc.) and an estimate of total costs for the entire year. Include a detailed M&R
          estimate sufficient to identify individual components of the work. State the required
          start date for the M&R work and an estimated performance period.
          9.12.6.3.4. State whether the work is routine or emergency and impact if waiver is
          not approved.
       9.12.6.4. Use MFH O&M funding to perform RPMC level work on surplus units under
       emergency conditions only (affecting life, health and safety), and when no other options
       exist to relocate families into adequate housing.
   9.12.7. MAJCOM must provide HQ USAF/A7CH individual base plans for
   disposal/divesture of surplus housing and the estimated date of completion of these actions.
   MAJCOMs report progress to HQ USAF/A7CH quarterly (1 January, April, July, October)
   on disposing/divesture actions as units are removed from AF Real Property records.
       9.12.7.1. Track the total housing inventory to include AF owned, leased and Section 801
       leased units.
       9.12.7.2. Provide occupancy rates as part of each report
       9.12.7.3. Track the number of adequate and inadequate surplus units and the number of
       units removed from the real property records.

       is updated in ACES-RP (Real Property).
9.13. Disposal/Divestiture. MAJCOMs should have a program for disposal/divestiture of
surplus units (requirements as defined in the latest HRMA), inadequate units replaced via
MILCON construction, or units conveyed as part of a privatization initiative in the FHMP.
MAJCOM Civil Engineers request approval from HQ USAF/A7C for all MFH
disposals/divestitures on a by-unit basis. See Attachment 5 for requirements for approval of
disposals/divestitures.
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                            81


                                          Chapter 10

                            AIR FORCE LEASING PROGRAM

10.1. Authority and Criteria. Congress authorized leasing of FH under 10 U.S.C. § 2828 as a
temporary measure to provide housing until permanent housing becomes available or the local
community can provide sufficient adequate and affordable housing. Specific criteria and
conditions for domestic and foreign leasing of FH units are contained in this chapter. Leasing
programs are administered all levels within the criteria and cost limitations established by law.
The authority to approve all leases or renewals may not exceed the total number allocated and
dollars appropriated annually (as administered by HQ USAF/A7CH).
   10.1.1. Domestic Lease Authority. 10 U.S.C. § 2828 authorizes domestic leasing of FH
   units provided annual costs do not exceed $12,000. Authority is also provided to lease a
   limited number of units that have annual costs not exceeding $14,000. These cost limits
   include the cost of utilities, maintenance and operation, and are adjusted annually by
   ODUSD (I&E). ODUSD (I&E) also allocates the available lease authorizations among the
   Services for each of the cost categories. There is no provision in 10 U.S.C. § 2828 for the
   Secretary of the Air Force to exceed the $14,000 (exclusive of annual ODUSD(I&E)
   adjustments) cost limit.
   10.1.2. Foreign Lease Authority. 10 U.S.C. § 2828 authorizes foreign leasing of FH units
   provided annual costs do not exceed $20,000 per unit. Authority is also provided to lease a
   limited number of units that have annual costs not exceeding $25,000 per unit. Additionally,
   authority is provided to lease units costing more than $25,000 annually for incumbents of
   SCPs, for personnel assigned to Defense Attaché Offices or units leased in countries where
   excessive costs of housing would cause undue hardship on personnel. These limits include
   the cost of utilities, maintenance and operation, and are adjusted annually by ODUSD(I&E).
   ODUSD(I&E) also allocates the available lease authorizations among the Services for each
   of the cost categories. 10 U.S.C. § 2828 further authorizes leasing of FH facilities, or foreign
   real property related to FH facilities, for which the average estimated annual rental during the
   term of the lease exceeds $1,000,000 after the appropriate committees of Congress are
   notified and a waiting period of 21 days elapses without comment.
   10.1.3. Delegations of Authority. The congressional authority vested in the SECAF to
   approve FH leases is redelegated to the Director and Deputy Director of the Air Force Real
   Property Agency (AFRPA), with limitations, IAW Secretary of the Air Force Order (SAFO)
   715.4 (25 July 2002), SAF/IE memorandum (25 July 2002), and SAF/IEI memorandum (13
   May 2003).
       10.1.3.1. AFRPA authority is subject to the following limitations:
           10.1.3.1.1. A new lease (or lease/contract agreement) involving more than 25
           housing units will be based on an economic analysis performed for the lease (or
           lease/contract).
           10.1.3.1.2. Leases in foreign countries must be made in conformance with
           agreements between the United States and the government of the host nation.
 82                   AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


          10.1.3.1.3. Lease points (lease authorizations) must exist for the requirement as
          determined by AF/A7CH.
          10.1.3.1.4. Authority may be further redelegated within AFRPA and to
          MAJCOM/CEs for FH leases that do not meet the criteria of a high-cost lease, which
          is defined as a lease exceeding the $12,000 cost limit for domestic leases and $20,000
          cost limit for foreign leases, after annual adjustment by ODUSD(I&E).
       10.1.3.2. AFRPA redelegated lease authority to the MAJCOM/CEs, excluding AFRC
       and ANG, for FH leases that do not meet the criteria of a high-cost lease. This authority
       may be redelegated to installations selected to participate in the Government Housing
       Rental Program (GHRP). The AFRPA/DR and Deputy retained approval authority for all
       domestic and foreign high-cost leases and for all AFRC and ANG leases.
       10.1.3.3. HAF Mission Directive 1-18, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force
       (Installations, Environment and Logistics), redelegated the 10 U.S.C. § 2828 leasing
       authorities from the SECAF to SAF/IE, subject to the redelegations previously made in
       the SAFO715.4.
10.2. Organizational Responsibilities:
   10.2.1. Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Installations and the Environment
   [ODUSD(I&E)]. ODUSD (I&E) allocates lease points (leasing authorizations) among the
   Services and other agencies subject to statutory provisions and considerations of legislative
   intent. ODUSD(I&E) also issues annual cost limits, per leased unit, for domestic and foreign
   leases that reflect the national median housing cost adjustments to the previous year domestic
   lease cost limits, and Consumer Price Index adjustments to foreign lease cost limits, based on
   the unadjusted limits established in 10 U.S.C. § 2828. Services further adjust lease cost
   limits in foreign counties for currency fluctuation.
   10.2.2. US Army Corps of Engineer (USACE). USACE normally serves as the Air Force
   Real Estate Agent. MAJCOMs may use the services of USACE to locate, negotiate and
   execute FH housing leases.
   10.2.3. Secretary of the Air Force, Installations, Financial Management and Budget
   (SAF/FMB). SAF/FMB notifies the appropriate congressional committees quarterly on new
   or renewal domestic high-cost leases occurring during the previous quarter, including
   certification that less expensive housing was not available for the lease. For foreign leases,
   SAF/FMB will notify the appropriate congressional committees on the details of any new or
   renewal high-cost lease agreement exceeding $1,000,000 annually or if lease agreement is for
   more than 25 high-cost units at least 21 days prior to entering into such an agreement.
   AF/A7CH prepares the staff package for SAF/FMB.
   10.2.4. Secretary of the Air Force, Installations (SAF/IEI). SAF/IEI approves Air Force
   participation in any DoS housing pool, per authority of 10 U.S.C. § 2834, Participation in
   Department of State Housing Pools, as delegated from the SECAF via SAFO 715.4 (25 July
   2002) and SAF/IE memorandum (25 July 2002).
   10.2.5. Air Force Real Property Agency (AFRPA). AFRPA/DR (or Deputy) approves all
   new and renewal high-cost leases, and all leases for the AFRC and ANG.
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                             83


      10.2.6. HQ USAF/A7CH. AF/A7CH establishes management procedures, controls and
      reporting requirements for the Housing Leasing Program and allocates FH lease points (one
      point equals authority for one leased unit). AF/A7CH also:
          10.2.6.1. Provides lease points to MAJCOMs for authorized domestic and foreign leases.
          10.2.6.2. Prepares staff package for SAF/FMB notification to Congress.
      10.2.7. Major Command (MAJCOM). The MAJCOM/CE (or designated senior officer at
      Combatant Commands or on the HAF staff) manages the leasing program within their
      command, validates requirements, develops justification, complies with statutory and
      administrative limitations, negotiates, and approves (within authorized limits) and executes
      leases IAW AFI 32-9001. MAJCOMs also:
          10.2.7.1. Plan and program for O&M of Section 801 and Build-to-Lease (BTL) FH units.
          10.2.7.2. Ensure an economic analysis is performed on any new lease or lease/contract
          agreement involving more than 25 units.
          10.2.7.3. Submit to HQ USAF/A7C by 1 July of each year a certified listing of each
          high-cost and Department of State (DoS) lease. The listing will include location of lease,
          member’s rank/grade and name, number dependents, annual lease and O&M costs, lease
          start date, and lease expiration date including option years (use member’s DEROS for
          DoS leases). Additionally, for DoS leases, indicate if the member falls under the
          authority of the country’s Chief of Mission per the National Security Decision Directive
          (NSDD) 38 process.
      10.2.8. Installation. Installations establish requirements for leased FH and manage leases in
      their area of responsibility. Installation HMOs, Air Force Recruiting Service (AFRS), Air
      Force Office of Accession and Training Schools (AFOATS), and any other agency that
      requires a lease, must identify the requirement to their MAJCOM, regardless of cost.
      Installations ensure BAH rate increases do not exceed the cost of the lease before exercising
      option years in existing lease agreements, in addition to evaluating other circumstances that
      may eliminate the need to continue the lease. Aviano AB IT, per selection to participate in
      GHRP, may approve non-high-cost GHRP leases.

   SAF/IEI must approve Air Force participation in any DoS housing pool, per SAF authority
  delegated from 10 U.S.C. § 2834, Participation in DoS Housing Pools, for members under
  command of a U.S. area military commander. Also, for all foreign leases, make-ready work
  (items needed to make comparable to a U.S. home) is limited to once during the life of the lease
  and the cost may not exceed 25 percent of the first year annual rent without approval from
  SAF/IEI.
 3
   An economic analysis is required if leasing more than 25 units (paragraph 10.4.1.3-4).
 4
   Aviano AB, IT, via selection to participate in GHRP, is the only installation with authority to approve
  non-high-cost GHRP leases.
 5
   Congressional notification, with 21-day waiting period prior to executing agreement is required for
  foreign leases exceeding $1,000,000 annually or if lease agreement is for more than 25 high-cost units.
  See paragraph 10.1.3.1.4 for the definition of a high-cost lease. Submit lease staff package for
  processing to AF/A7CH at least 12 weeks before anticipated lease execution. Congressional
  notification is not required when the Air Force participates in a DoS Housing Pool.
 6
   Quartetrly congressional notification is required on new or renewal leases from previous quarter, to
  include certification that less expensive housing was not available for lease. See paragraph 10.1.3.1.4
  for the definition of a high-cost lease.


10.3. Air Force Leasing Policy (DoD 4165. 63-M):
     10.3.1. Leasing is used for requirements of short-range or uncertain duration or for special
     situations. Leased FH units are designated public quarters, operated and assigned as
     adequate government-controlled FH, and occupants forfeit their housing allowance upon
     occupancy. See paragraphs 5.2 and 5.5 and Table 5.2 for civilian employee eligibility and
     rental rates.
     10.3.2. FH may be leased only after obtaining approval of leasing authority (points), and
     verification of availability of current FY MFH funds. The authority to approve all leases or
     renewals may not exceed the total number allocated (points) and dollars appropriated
     annually.
     10.3.3. Advance rental payments may be made within the criteria outlined in 10 U.S.C. §
     2396 when it is in the best interests of the U.S. Government or is an established custom in a
     foreign country.
     10.3.4. A lease may not be entered into if the average estimated annual rental for FH exceeds
     the annual limit during any year within the term of the lease.
     10.3.5. The MAJCOM may enter into an agreement with the DoS, where the DoS agrees to
     provide housing and related services for personnel who are assigned to duty in a foreign
     country, if there is a shortage of adequate housing in the area in which the personnel are
     assigned to duty and participation in the DoS housing pool is the most cost-effective means
     of providing housing. SAF/IEI must first approve participation in the DoS housing pool, and
     it is mandatory to first obtain a lease point from AF/A7CH before executing a DoS lease
     agreement.
10.4. Leasing Cost Limits:
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                              85


   10.4.1. Domestic and Foreign. Annual cost limits apply to the housing unit itself, and
   includes operations, maintenance and utilities costs. Leases are renewed annually, and the
   cost is paid from the appropriations of the new or renewal year.
      10.4.1.1. Costs to be included within the statutory limitations are basic shelter rent,
      maintenance and utilities when not provided by the lessor, and services (such as refuse
      collection) if separately contracted by the lessor.
      10.4.1.2. Costs excluded from the statutory lease cap limitations are initial make-ready
      costs; costs of government-owned furnishings; any pro rata share of the costs of
      installation services (refuse disposal, police and fire protection, etc.); administrative costs
      such as assignment, travel, and inspection by installation personnel; costs above
      installation level, such as costs attributable to USACE districts, public works offices, and
      other command levels as well as headquarters levels for personnel, travel, inspections and
      other like expenses.
      10.4.1.3. When leasing more than 25 FH units, perform an EA to determine the most
      effective method to obtain housing. Accomplish the EA IAW OMB Circular A-94,
      Discount Rates to be Used in Evaluating Time-Distributed Costs and Benefit, DoD
      7041.3-I, Economic Analysis for Decision Making, AFI 65-501 and AFMAN 32-1089.
   10.4.2. Foreign Only:
      10.4.2.1. Limit make-ready repairs (items needed to make comparable to U.S. home),
      alterations and additional work necessary to provide adequate living accommodations.
      Make-ready work is also limited to once during the life of the lease and the cost may not
      exceed 25 percent of the first year annual rent without authority from SAF/IEI. Leased
      General Officer Homes (GOH) must also comply with all congressional cost limitations,
      including operations, maintenance and utilities).
      10.4.2.2. Units leased via participation in a DoS pool do not count against the high-cost
      lease authority allocated by ODUSD(I&E). Reimburse the DoS for housing and related
      services furnished.
10.5. Procedures:
   10.5.1. When to Lease - Domestic. The Air Force may lease existing privately owned FH
   in CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Guam for assignment to eligible members and
   DoD civilian employees, when the requirement is supported by the following:
      10.5.1.1. Shortage of adequate FH at or near the installation.
      10.5.1.2. Installation HRMA (AFI 32-6002).
      10.5.1.3. Low vacancy rate (two percent or less) in community housing, or government
      or privatized housing, whichever exists at the installation.
      10.5.1.4. Less expensive, adequate FH is unavailable in community housing
      10.5.1.5. Rental rate exceeds 7.5 percent of member’s BAH.
   10.5.2. When to Lease – Foreign:
 86                   AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


       10.5.2.1. The Air Force may lease existing privately owned FH or privately owned
       Build-to-Lease FH, which is constructed specifically for assignment to eligible members
       and DoD civilian employees.
       10.5.2.2. FH may be leased in foreign locations for a period of 10 years (15 years in the
       Republic of Korea) for DoD military and authorized civilian personnel and incumbents of
       SCPs in locations where excessive housing costs would cause an undue hardship or in
       countries that prohibit leasing to individuals.
       10.5.2.3. FH may be leased in countries that prohibit leases by individual military or
       civilian personnel of the U.S.
10.6. Foreign Build-to-Lease (BTL) Family Housing. BTL housing is congressionally
approved and includes leasing groups (typically 100 to 400 or more units) of existing privately
owned units or BTL units for military members and eligible DoD civilians when adequate
housing is not readily available. The BTL Program allows FH to be built specifically for leasing
to the Air Force. A BTL contract may not exceed 10 years, and the annual cost for each year is
paid from appropriations for that year. If leased FH is required beyond the initial 10 years,
another agreement is negotiated. Before entering into the second agreement, as with the first, a
21-day congressional notification is required with complete justification including an economic
analysis. MAJCOMs:
   10.6.1. By memorandum, notify AF/A7CH and AFRPA of intent to pursue a BTL project,
   including scope and composition, and provide justification for proposed acquisition. The
   requirement must be supported by an HRMA not more than 3 years old.
   10.6.2. After initial approval by AF/A7CH, develop a draft Request for Proposal (RFP),
   coordinate with the MAJCOM CE/JA/FM, and forward two copies to AF/A7CH for review
   and coordination with SAF/GCN.
   10.6.3. After approval of the draft RFP by AF/A7CH, finalize and issue the RFP and
   complete the evaluation and selection process.
   10.6.4. Prepare the final project proposal, including the EA, contract drawings and
   specifications and a cover memorandum verifying MAJCOM CE/JA/FM coordination and
   forwards to AF/A7CH and AFRPA for final review. AF/A7CH coordinates the proposal
   through HQ USAF/A7C, SAF/General Counsel, Environment and Operations Division
   (SAF/GCN), SAF/FMC and SAF/IE for approval to forward the proposal to the appropriate
   congressional committees for the 21-day notification. At the end of 21 calendar days,
   AFRPA will notify the MAJCOM of authority to award the project for construction.
10.7. How to Request Lease Approval:
   10.7.1. Installations:
       10.7.1.1. Forward basic lease information and preliminary market analysis to the
       MAJCOM for coordination and forwarding to AF/A7CH for approval-in-principle.
       10.7.1.2. After the MAJCOM returns AF/A7CH approval-in-principle, the installation
       establishes the leasing requirement by completing all items specified in Tables 10.4
       (domestic) or 10.5 (foreign), and attaches supporting documents, to include a mandatory
       market survey. Also attach the checklist at Table 10.6 (domestic) or 10.7 (foreign) to
       facilitate tracking progress of the lease approval, and forward the formal leasing request
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                        87


      package to the MAJCOM. The checklist and all documents remain with the package as a
      permanent record. Aviano AB, IT, via selection to participate in GHRP, may execute
      non-high cost GHRP leases.
   10.7.2. MAJCOMs:
      10.7.2.1. Apply programming benchmark size for government-owned FH to leased FH
      and perform a preliminary market survey. See AFI 32-6002 for policies and criteria for
      programming, planning and acquiring leased units.
      10.7.2.2. Use the sample memo in Table 10.2 to request approval-in-principle in advance
      of the request for final approval to lease FH, including request to exceed programming
      benchmark FH size, when required.
      10.7.2.3. After approval-in-principle, the MAJCOM may coordinate with the Air Force
      Leasing Agent to perform a comprehensive market survey, locate the property, validate
      the unavailability of benchmark size, when required and prioritize recommended units to
      lease.
      10.7.2.4. If adequate leased FH within the programming benchmark size cannot be
      located, the MAJCOM certifies the unavailability, requests approval for waiving the
      programming benchmark, documents the processing checklist, and forwards the request
      to AF/A7CH for funding (lease point) and final authorization to pursue the lease.
      10.7.2.5. Submit information for foreign high-cost leases to AF/A7CH at least 12 weeks
      before anticipated lease execution to allow time for congressional notification and the
      mandatory 21-day waiting period. The lease may not be executed before the end of this
      waiting period.
      10.7.2.6. Maintain a complete record of all lease documentation IAW the Air Force
      Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with
      air force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition
      Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/.
   10.7.3. HQ USAF/A7CH:
      10.7.3.1. Reviews lease requests for approval-in-principle for appropriate information,
      and returns non-high-cost lease to the MAJCOM for approval and execution. AFRC and
      ANG requests are sent to AFRPA for approval, and then forwarded to AFRC/ANG for
      execution.
      10.7.3.2. If applicable, approves or disapproves the request to exceed benchmark size
      standards and returns to MAJCOM to approve non-high-cost leases or to develop the
      final lease package for high-cost leases.
      10.7.3.3. Prepares staffing package for SAF/FMB notification to Congress for high-cost
      leases, obtain coordination from AFRPA/DR, SAF/GCN and SAF/IEI before forwarding
      to SAF/FMB.
10.8. Reporting:
   10.8.1. Domestic leases. SAF/FMB notifies the appropriate congressional committees on
   new or renewal high-cost domestic leases entered into during the previous quarter, including
  88                     AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


     certification that less expensive housing was not available for lease. Notification is not
     required when exercising option years to existing lease agreements.
     10.8.2. Foreign leases. SAF/FMB notifies the appropriate congressional committees of the
     details of new or renewal high-cost lease agreements at least 21 days prior to entering an
     agreement exceeding $1,000,000 annually or if lease agreement is for more than 25 high-cost
     units. Notification is not required when exercising option years to existing lease agreements,
     nor when the Air Force participates in a DoS Housing Pool.
 10.9. Leasing for Unaccompanied Housing (UH) Requirements: Refer to paragraph 2.10,
 AFI 32-6005, Unaccompanied Housing Management, and AFI 32-9001, Acquisition of Real
 Property, for guidance on leasing for UH requirements.
 10.10. Section 801 Housing. AFRPA is negotiating divestures of all Air Force Section 801
 Housing by 2017. The Air Force does not anticipate a requirement for future leased Section 801
 Housing.

                                        Chapter 11

                              FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

11.1. Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH). Military personnel with dependents, as defined in
37 U.S.C. 401, are entitled to receive BAH, except when they and their dependents (or their
dependents only) occupy adequate government housing. Refer to AFI 32-6005 for housing
unaccompanied personnel and BAH eligibility.
   11.1.1. The Housing Flight prepares an ACES-generated AF Form 594 annotating the date
   and address of the housing being assigned or terminated, and forwards the AF Form 594 to
   the FSO for processing. The FSO determines dependency and BAH entitlement and enters
   required changes on the AF Form 594.
   11.1.2. BAH will commence when the member departs the losing installation pursuant to
   valid PCS orders, regardless of whether the assignment to housing has been officially
   terminated (CG Decision B-213560, 3 Apr 84).
   11.1.3. When mil-to-mil members are assigned to FH on the same or adjacent installations
   prepare an AF Form 594 for each member and send to FSO for processing. When one
   member arrives on station before the other and is eligible for housing based on other
   dependents, BAH terminates upon arrival of that member. BAH for the member arriving
   later terminates upon arrival. If one mil-to-mil member departs the installation before the
   other and one remains in housing, prepare AF Form 594s, identify the date each member
   departs and forward to FSO for processing as the member departs.
   11.1.4. For Army, Navy and Marine Corps member, the Housing Office prepares an ACES-
   generated AF Form 594 to notify their FSO of FH assignment or termination. Send the AF
   form with a DD Form 114, Military Pay Order to the appropriate Service FSO. Keep one
   copy of these forms in suspense pending acknowledgement of receipt from the Service FSO.
   11.1.5. The effective date of assignment to government FH is the date the member or
   designated representative assumes responsibility or accepts keys for the housing unit,
   whichever occurs first.
   11.1.6. FH accepted and occupied by the member or dependents is considered adequate
   housing according to grade and family size requirements.
   11.1.7. Quarterly, the FSO initiates the BAH reconciliation with Housing to ensure members
   assigned to FH are receiving housing allowances appropriately.
      11.1.7.1. AFCESA provides ACES data to DFAS to compare with pay records. DFAS
      provides the FSO with discrepancies between the ACES data and pay records on a
      Family Quarters Verification report. FSO provides this report to the Housing Flight.
      11.1.7.2. Within 5 business days, the Housing Flight investigates the discrepancies and
      provides a copy of the original AF IMT 594 and transmittal to the FSO. If no AF IMT
      594 exists in the housing records, the Housing Flight provides a new AF IMT 594 to the
      FSO showing the original assignment date. The Housing Flight Chief assists with any
      further action required resulting from the discrepancies.
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                         95


       11.1.7.3. The Housing Flight verifies that civilian personnel assigned to FH are either
       paying rental charges or forfeiting LQA, as specified in kl Chapter 5, Housing Civilian
       Personnel.
   11.1.8. When FH is not furnished for dependents, a member may occupy single-type UH
   that is at or below minimum standards for members without dependents without affecting
   their option to receive BAH at the higher rate, based on previous duty station. Housing
   exceeding the minimum standards must be (a) the only housing available, (b) not suitable for
   joint occupancy or (c) jointly occupied with other members permanently assigned to the PDS
   in order not to affect the members BAH. For example, a student could live in a dorm room
   and continue to draw the higher BAH rate as long as the above criteria are met. Dorm rooms
   normally would not exceed minimum standards (paragraph 2.22).
   11.1.9. Members are reimbursed from the installation O&M funds for lodging expenses
   exceeding BAH rates when they are temporarily displaced from FH for the convenience of
   the government (programmed renovations, upgrades and emergency repairs) (Comptroller
   General decisions B-213293 and B-225205; and AFI 34-206, Air Force Lodging Program).
       11.1.9.1. The member claims housing expenses exceeding the BAH entitlement on
       Standard Form (SF) 1164, Claims for Reimbursement for Reimbursement for
       Expenditures on Official Business.
       11.1.9.2. Residents may claim housing expenses exceeding the BAH entitlement for (1)
       the number of days lodged in TLF and off-base contract quarters, and (2) up to the
       maximum allowable lodging rate for that locale IAW Joint Federal Travel Regulation
       (JFTR), for the number of days lodged in off-base noncontract quarters.
11.2. Living Quarters Allowance (LQA). Housing management sends a written notice to the
servicing CPF to start or stop LQA when civilian employees are assigned to or terminate
government housing. Civilian employees occupying FH do not receive LQA payment
(paragraph 5.5).
11.3. Temporary Lodging Allowance (TLA). Members in PCS status are authorized to
receive TLA upon arrival and departure in OCONUS areas.
11.4. Temporary Lodging Expense (TLE). An allowance to partially offset the added living
expenses incurred in CONUS by members and dependents when occupying temporary lodging
incident to PCS.
11.5. Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA) and Move-In Housing Allowance (MIHA). For
OCONUS areas only, individuals moving into community housing may be eligible for OHA and
MIHA. Specific circumstances, conditions and requirements of OHA or MIHA are identified in
the JFTR.
11.6. Dislocation Allowance (DLA). The FSO authorizes DLA for expenses incurred in
relocating the member’s household on a PCS move, moves ordered for the government’s
convenience, or incident to an evacuation. This allowance is in addition to all other allowances
authorized in the JFTR and may be paid in advance.
11.7. Partial Dislocation Allowance (PDLA).
   11.7.1. Members of all Services are entitled to a PDLA when ordered to occupy or vacate
   government or government-controlled family-type housing. Do not pay PDLA when the
 96                   AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


   service member is ordered to occupy or vacate housing that is not provided by the
   government, and do not pay PDLA for moves from privatized housing to privatized housing
   or from privatized housing to other nongovernment or nongovernment-controlled housing.
       11.7.1.1. PDLA is authorized on an AF IMT 150, Drayage/Storage Authorization –
       Government Quarters, in conjunction with a local move, but PDLA is not authorized
       without an approved local move.
   11.7.2. HMOs primarily use ACES to process an electronic AF IMT 150. When it is
   necessary to manually generate the form, a timely update must be made in ACES from the
   manual form.
   11.7.3. HMO instructs the service member to file a voucher for PDLA at FSO, using the AF
   IMT 150, after the move-in date.
   11.7.4. Retain the AF IMT 150 for 6 years, 3 months, per the Air Force Information
   Management System, Rules T65-19R 3.00 and R21.00.
   11.7.5. HMO coordinates with the FSO monthly to reconcile PDLA records and to verify
   authorized members received PDLA.
11.8. Reimbursement to the Housing Account. The Air Force accepts agency-to-agency
transfer as an acceptable method of rental payment for the U.S. Coast Guard only (paragraph
5.5.1). HMO coordinates billing and collection procedures with the appropriate FSO.
   11.8.1. All APF and NAF personnel residing in government-controlled FH are individually
   responsible for rental payments on a monthly basis.
   11.8.2. The HMO coordinates billing and collection procedures with the appropriate FSO.
   For civilians not entitled to a housing allowance, collect rent locally using a DD Form 1131,
   Cash Collection Voucher (paragraph 5.5).
11.9. Disconnection and Reinstallation Charges. Reimburse member for telephone and cable
reconnection fees when local moves are government-directed and member is not entitled to
PDLA. Members are entitled to reimbursement to restore the same service they had at their
previous residence, and there is no limit to the number of disconnection and reinstallation
reimbursements. Do not authorize reimbursement for disconnection and reinstallation when
member is evicted by the government.
11.10. Local Drayage and Household Goods (HHG) Storage. Personnel directed to move
into, between and from government housing are entitled to a local HHG move and HHG storage
at government expense, as authorized by JFTR, Volume 1, Chapter 5, part D, paragraph U5355,
section B. The HMO must stay updated with and consistently apply JFTR policy. The HMO
Manager, in coordination with the local traffic management office (TMO) or Joint Personal
Property Shipping Office, budgets and controls local drayage and storage funds (P-3400) (AF
IMT 406, Miscellaneous Reimbursement Obligation Document, and AF IMT 616, Fund Cite
Authorization (FCA). Use ACES to track and reconcile these drayage and storage funds. Local
drayage and HHG storage is authorized on ACES-generated AF IMT 150. Moves to, from or
between FH units for the convenience of the member or family are not authorized at government
expense.
   11.10.1. Local Drayage. The following are government-paid moves:
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                       97


     11.10.1.1. Local moves from community housing to government-owned, -leased and
     privatized housing are paid on a one-time basis after PCS. Subsequent moves from FH to
     community housing or from community housing to government housing are paid only
     when directed by the Commander, except the Housing Flight Chief may authorize a local
     move from one unit on base to another to prevent more than two dependent children from
     sharing a bedroom.
     11.10.1.2. Local moves to vacate government housing scheduled for major repair or
     renovation or for housing privatization before conveyance of property to private owner.
     11.10.1.3. Local moves from government-owned and -leased housing resulting from
     family separation or divorce are paid when member no longer lives with dependents or
     dependents no longer live with member (paragraph 6.3.5).
     11.10.1.4. An Armed Forces member who relocates from, or whose dependent relocates
     from, leased or rented private housing, by reason of a foreclosure action against the
     landlord is authorized a short distance move (P.L.110-289; 37 U.S.C. § 406). The
     following provisions apply:
         11.10.1.4.1. This provision does not apply if the member or dependent is the
         homeowner.
         11.10.1.4.2. The move is to another dwelling from which the member is to commute
         daily to the PDS (or to a location where the dependent resides).
         11.10.1.4.3. Before using this authority, encourage member to exhaust remedies
         available under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (50 U.S.C., Appendix 531) and
         state law.
         11.10.1.4.4. Members requesting a government-funded local move submit a written
         request to the Housing Management Office with justification to include lease,
         termination notice from the foreclosing company, financial institution or other legal
         authority requiring the member or dependent to vacate the property, and other related
         documentation.
         11.10.1.4.5. Members should be advised to contact the installation JA office to seek
         advice concerning their rights and responsibilities under the terms of the lease.
         Remind members that their housing allowances will be terminated upon moving into
         government-managed housing.
         11.10.1.4.6. Housing Management should develop local procedures to coordinate
         with the installation JA to validate member’s documentation and to verify the
         member is being forced to move because of a foreclosure action.
  11.10.2. Nontemporary Storage (NTS) of Household Goods (HHG). A member is
  authorized NTS of HHG excess to needs while occupying government-managed and
  privatized housing. The member sends a request for nontemporary storage (NTS) to the
  Housing Management Office and attaches an inventory of items to be stored. In considering
  requests for NTS of HHGs, Housing Asset Managers perform the following management
  controls:
     11.10.2.1. Brief newly assigned members on NTS authority and that residents must
     request NTS within 30 days after housing assignment. The Housing Management Office
98                  AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


     may extend the 30-day period as circumstances warrant. The member should consult the
     JFTR Appendix A (definition of household goods) for clarification of items that are
     prohibited for government storage.
     11.10.2.2. NTS authority excludes furnishings acquired after move-in. NTS is not
     authorized for member voluntarily vacating government-managed or privatized housing
     for personal convenience.
     11.10.2.3. The Housing Asset Manager approves those items determined to be
     impractical or unsuitable for use in the housing unit assigned. Generally, impractical or
     unsuitable furnishings are items that are unusable due to design configuration or
     insufficient space in the housing unit; for example, oversized beds, sofas, bookcases and
     books, dinette sets, china cabinets (and associated china and crystal), and clothing
     required only in another climate. Items not appropriate for NTS under this paragraph are
     accessory household items, such as vacuum cleaners and other minor appliances and
     machinery (i.e., table and chain saws and craft equipment), trashcans, vehicles and
     vehicle parts, building material, suitcases, commonly used clothing, linens, small rugs,
     toys and other miscellaneous small items. Major appliances may be stored if like items
     are government- provided.
     11.10.2.4. A member may request a dockside release of a partial inventory of HHG and
     ship the rest. Since there is no authority for a member to open boxes, sort and remove
     contents, extra charges will be assessed. The member coordinates financial arrangements
     for extra charges with the NTS agent.
     11.10.2.5. At CONUS locations, reassess the need for continued NTS when member
     moves into larger FH (move between units).
     11.10.2.6. Include a reminder on out-processing checklists for the member to remove
     NTS upon departure from the installation.
     11.10.2.7. Unless authorized and funded by the CPF, disapprove requests from DoD
     civilians for storage of HHG incidental to occupying government-managed or privatized
     housing.
  11.10.3. See Table 11.1 for further guidance on drayage and NTS eligibility.

                                          Attachment 3
             PROCESSING HOUSING DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS

A3.1. Detecting Potential Discrimination. Refusing to show, rent, lease or sell suitable
housing to potential residents may establish the basis for a potential complaint of housing
discrimination. Language that expresses or conveys discrimination or suggests discriminatory
policy is considered an act or incident of discrimination. Promptly report every incident of
potential housing discrimination to the Housing Flight Chief for action, and follow the
investigative procedures in this chapter.
A3.2. Initial Inquiry Into Complaint. Within 3 workdays after receiving a complaint of
discrimination, the Housing Flight Chief or housing representative initiates an inquiry. The
inquiry may be informal, but must be detailed enough to determine if discrimination may exist,
as defined in Attachment 1, Terms.
   A3.2.1. Interview the complainant promptly and document details of the circumstances
   surrounding the alleged discriminatory act.
   A3.2.2. Notify the BCE and Commander immediately.
   A3.2.3. If the complaint concerns a change in availability of a vacancy (such as just rented)
   and the Housing Flight receives notice soon after the alleged act, immediately determine
   whether there is an actual vacancy. The Commander may authorize the use of two or more
   verifiers. The housing representative may telephone or visit the agent and without referring
   to the complaint, try to verify the vacancy without alerting the agent that a complaint has
   been received.
   A3.2.4. To allow prospective tenants to decide if they wish to look at the facility in question,
   advise them that the Housing Flight has received a complaint of discrimination against the
   agent or facility, but that the inquiry has not yet been completed.
   A3.2.5. Advise the complainant of the following:
       A3.2.5.1. Procedures set forth in this instruction.
       A3.2.5.2. Their right to take further actions through Housing and Urban Development
       (HUD), Department of Justice (DOJ), or local or state agencies during or after the AF
       inquiry and without regard to AF results. If the complainant files a complaint with
       another agency and the AF inquiry is incomplete, do not delay the AF investigation
       pending the outcome of the other investigation. Even if the complainant declines to
       submit HUD Form 903, Housing Discrimination Complaint, the Commander is still
       responsible for conducting the inquiry and for taking whatever action is required.
   A3.2.6. Document actions and submit the results of the preliminary inquiry, including
   complete documentation, to the Commander to make a determination of discrimination.
   A3.2.7. If the inquiry validates the complaint and the complainant concurs, the Commander
   sends the complaint, with supporting documents to HUD using HUD Form 903, and an
   information copy to DOJ.
   A3.2.8. Assist the complainant, as follows:
 122                   AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


       A3.2.8.1. Complete HUD Form 903 in seven signed, dated and notarized copies.
       (Recommend a housing staff member be a licensed notary public.) Summarize the
       incident in the summary of events on HUD Form 903, and include that statement as part
       of the file sent by the Commander.
       A3.2.8.2. Coordinate with the base legal office to advise the complainant on:
           A3.2.8.2.1. How the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Civil Rights Act of 1968 apply
           and the limitations in the current situation.
           A3.2.8.2.2. The complainant’s right to file the complaint directly with HUD or DOJ,
           or to bring a private civil action in the proper local, state or Federal court.
           A3.2.8.2.3. Legal assistance available at the installation.
       A3.2.8.3. Options for obtaining suitable housing. If after a reasonable amount of time,
       the complainant cannot find adequate housing because of discriminatory practices in the
       community, the Commander may approve the priority assignment to FH. As a last resort,
       a humanitarian reassignment action may be appropriate, but must be fully justified as
       required by AFI 36-2706, Military Equal Opportunity and Treatment Program. A
       statement from the Commander that FH is not available must support the request for
       reassignment.
A3.3. Selecting and Using Verifiers. The Commander may authorize the use of verifiers to
investigate the complaint, as necessary. Do not use verifiers solely to determine practices and
behaviors of an agent outside the allegations of the current complaint. The following procedures
apply:
   A3.3.1. Verify a vacancy as soon as possible after the discrimination is alleged.
   A3.3.2. Use volunteer verifiers, if possible, from the base social actions office and
   Command Chief Master Sergeant. Do not use housing management personnel except in an
   unusual situation.
   A3.3.3. Verifiers determine what characteristic (race, color, religion, sex, national origin or
   familial status) is the suspected basis for unequal treatment or for declining rental or sales to
   the complainant.
       A3.3.3.1. Use verifiers with the same basic characteristics as the complainant, except the
       characteristics that are identified in the complaint.
       A3.3.3.2. Use two verifiers, one that possesses similar characteristics to the complainant.
A3.4. Instructions to Verifiers. The Housing Flight explains the policy and procedures of
Equal Opportunity in community housing and housing referral programs and emphasizes that the
verifiers:
   A3.4.1. Obtain information about the operating policies, practices and procedures of the
   agent or facility that can be used to determine the validity of the complaint.
   A3.4.2. Do not make any verbal or written contract for the apartment, pay any money or
   express a commitment for facility. Instead, verifiers may say that the property does not meet
   their needs or they are looking for less expensive or larger housing. At the time of the visit,
   the verifier must make it clear to the agent they are not interested in the facility.
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                              123


   A3.4.3. Know the family composition, pets and housing requirements of the complainant, so
   they can ask for identical requirements.
   A3.4.4. Obtain the following information, if possible, for inclusion in the inquiry.
       A3.4.4.1. Facility. Which facility was available; did it meet the complainant’s
       requirements; rental amount; deposit required; are children and pets allowed; is
       application required; time lag between the application and move in date; minority
       families or minority singles in the facility; presence or absence of a vacancy sign; and
       other appropriate information.
       A3.4.4.2. Prospective Tenant. Qualifications requirements (such as credit rating, salary,
       marital status, race, children, deposit, written application), including all steps from initial
       inquiry to moving in. Verifier’s opinion about whether the manager’s subjective
       impression of the applicant would play a part in the decision to rent an apartment?
   A3.4.5. The verifier completes statement immediately after the verification visit, and it must
   be accurate, objective and detailed. Include the following:
       A3.4.5.1. Date, time of visit, name and position of person contacted. Include any other
       pertinent information obtained during the visit such as length of time employed at facility
       and race of person contacted.
       A3.4.5.2. In reconstructing the conversation, write in the first person (I and we). Use
       direct quotes if possible, and give the full name of the person being quoted, and the
       persons to whom they are speaking. Do not use the pronouns, he, she or they to refer to
       persons quoted.
       A3.4.5.3. Verifier signs and dates the statement, gives full name, address and telephone
       number (duty and home), and provides race or other self-characteristics relevant to the
       complaint.
A3.5. Notice of an Informal Hearing. With three workdays of receiving the inquiry report
initially substantiating the complaint, but before final determination of validity, the Commander
sends a written notice to the agent of the facility. A representative of the Commander delivers the
notice to the agent personally, or the notice is sent to the agent by certified mail with return
receipt. NOTE: This notice explains the specific nature of the discrimination complaint and
states that the agent has a right to:
   A3.5.1. Request a hearing with the Commander and to appear personally at the hearing.
   A3.5.2. Be represented by an attorney.
   A3.5.3. Present evidence and call witnesses on his or her behalf. NOTE: After receiving
   the notice, the agent has 5 workdays to request a hearing. If the Commander receives no
   request within that time, the right to a hearing is considered waived.
A3.6. Conducting Informal Hearing. The Commander will hold this hearing at a convenient
location.
   A3.6.1. The agent, the agent’s attorney, the complainant, the complainant’s attorney, the
   equal opportunity officer, housing management representative, JA or other designated
   persons may attend.
 124                   AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


   A3.6.2. A summary of the hearing is prepared and placed in the complaint file. The
   summary should include who attended, location of hearing, and a summary of discussion.
A3.7. Disclosure of Information. Give copies of HUD Form 903 and other pertinent
statements required for HUD or DOJ action to the agent or agent’s attorney. The AF must not
damage any potential HUD or DOJ investigation by disclosing facts before other enforcement
agencies begin their procedures.
A3.8. Legal Review. Request a legal review for content and completeness after the inquiry and
informal hearing (if applicable), but before the Commander makes a final determination of
complaint validity. Place a statement in the file, signed by the installation JA performing the
review, that the review was conducted. The statement must include:
   A3.8.1. Explanatory remarks, including comments about the facts and evidence presented.
   A3.8.2. Information about other pending complaints from private parties against the same
   facility or agent.
   A3.8.3. Comments regarding how state, federal, local or foreign country civil rights
   legislation applies to the case.
A3.9. Installation Commander Determination. The Commander alone must render the
determination of discrimination, and is responsible for imposing restrictive sanctions if
complaint is validated. This responsibility may not be delegated. The Commander’s decision
must be based on a full and impartial review of facts weighed against this instruction. The
Commander has the option to make further inquiry or to close the case. If the case is closed, the
steps to take vary, depending on whether the complaint was or was not validated.
A3.10. Making a Further Inquiry. If the Commander requires more information, or further
inquiry, an AF officer is appointed from outside the Housing Flight to make a formal inquiry or
investigation, as the situation warrants. If the officer is not an attorney, the JA, EEO office and
housing representative are available to advise and assist.
A3.11. Closing the Case:
   A3.11.1. If the Commander determines that the inquiry did not validate the complaint, the
   case is closed, and:
       A3.11.1.1. The Commander advises the complainant in writing of:
           A3.11.1.1.1. Actions taken and their right to proceed with further action (submit a
           complaint to HUD and/or DOJ, or to initiate a civil action).
           A3.11.1.1.2. Availability of legal assistance from the installation JA or other legal
           counsel in pursuing a civil action.
       A3.11.1.2. The Housing Flight discontinues the action described in paragraph A3.2.4
       and prepares a summary of the case for the report file.
           A3.11.1.2.1. The summary outlines the practices that gave rise to the complaint,
           actions and results of the inquiry, action of Commander to obtain relief, as well as a
           commitment from the agent of the facility about future practices.
           A3.11.1.2.2. The case file also includes the statement, completed by the complainant:
           I (am)(am not) satisfied with the efforts taken by the Commander in my behalf to
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                         125


         achieve satisfactory resolution of my off-base housing discrimination complaint. If
         the complainant is not satisfied with actions or results, so state in the file.
     A3.11.1.3. If an informal hearing was offered, the Commander notifies the agent by
     command correspondence of the inquiry results. This notification should emphasize that
     DoD and AF policy must ensure equal opportunity in community housing.
     A3.11.1.4. The Commander sends the report to the MAJCOM and other agencies as
     explained in paragraph A3.12.
  A3.11.2. If the inquiry validates the discrimination complaint, and the Commander
  determines the discriminatory act conflicts with DoD or AF policy, the following actions
  must be taken:
     A3.11.2.1. Impose restrictive sanctions against the agent and all properties represented
     by the agent for a minimum of 180 days or until other specific requirements in
     paragraph A3.15 are met.
         A3.11.2.1.1. Also, impose restrictive sanctions when an alleged discriminatory act is
         investigated and substantiated, even without a written complaint.
         A3.11.2.1.2. Do not withhold restrictive sanctions pending investigation of another
         agency (HUD or DOJ).
         A3.11.2.1.3. To ensure program credibility, impose restrictive sanctions promptly
         and correctly once a complaint is substantiated.
     A3.11.2.2. Take the following steps in imposing restrictive sanctions:
         A3.11.2.2.1. If the facility is listed with the Housing Flight, remove the listing from
         the files.
         A3.11.2.2.2. Impose sanctions against all facilities owned or operated by the agent on
         the date of notification.
         A3.11.2.2.3. Revise the restrictive sanctions list to include the facility. Prepare the
         restrictive sanctions list on official letterhead stationery and send to the Commander
         for signature.
         A3.11.2.2.4. The Commander informs the agent, by command correspondence, that
         restrictive sanctions have been imposed and the reasons why, explains the nature and
         minimum length of the restrictions and outlines what action is required to remove the
         restrictive sanctions. The notice is personally delivered to the agent by a
         representative of the Commander or is sent by certified mail with a return receipt
         requested.
         A3.11.2.2.5. Personnel seeking housing in the community are given a copy of the
         restrictive sanctions list, informed they may not rent, lease, purchase or reside in any
         of the facilities listed, and sign a statement verifying they received the list.
         A3.11.2.2.6. The Housing Flight sends the restrictive sanction list to the public
         affairs officer to incorporate into the appropriate internal information program.
     A3.11.2.3. The Commander informs the complainant in writing of all actions taken, and
     that the complaint receives continuing base attention. If appropriate, send a copy of this
 126                  AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


       notice to agencies where the complaint file is being sent and repeat complainant’s right to
       pursue remedies in civil court. If the complainant has not been suitably housed, the
       Commander emphasizes continuing assistance of the Housing Flight.
       A3.11.2.4. The Commander develops a cover memorandum, analyzing the:
          A3.11.2.4.1. Impact of restrictive sanctions on the facility, DoD personnel and their
          dependents and the community-housing program.
          A3.11.2.4.2. The number of facility units involved (if available).
          A3.11.2.4.3. The base efforts in locating housing for the complainant.
          A3.11.2.4.4. Other relevant considerations.
       A3.11.2.5. The Commander requires the following statement be completed by the
       complainant and placed in the case file: I (am)(am not) satisfied with the efforts taken by
       the Commander in my behalf to achieve satisfactory resolution of my off-base housing
       discrimination complaint. If the complainant is not satisfied, document the reasons in the
       case file.
       A3.11.2.6. The Commander sends the complaint as outlined in paragraphs A3.12.
A3.12. Submitting the Report. Timely submission of the complaint report is extremely
important. Complete the inquiry or investigation and administrative actions within 35 calendar
days after the complaint is received.
   A3.12.1. Interim Report. If an inquiry requires more than 35 days, the Commander sends an
   interim report to the MAJCOM Civil Engineer
       A3.12.1.1. The interim report may be in narrative format, with details presented in
       chronological order, or it may be sent as a case file.
       A3.12.1.2. The MAJCOM monitors the action taken on the complaint to make sure
       correct procedures are followed in the investigation, the base is responding affirmatively
       to the complaint, and the base expedites the process.
   A3.12.2. Unsubstantiated Complaints. If the complaint is not validated by the investigation,
   the Commander sends a copy of the case file to the MAJCOM for information and review.

       A3.12.3.2.   Within 20 days of the date the case is forwarded from the installation, the
       MAJCOM        reviews and sends four copies of substantiated case files and pertinent
       MAJCOM        correspondence and a MAJCOM legal review, to HQ USAF/A7CH. If
       necessary,   the MAJCOM promptly returns the case to the installation for corrective
       action.
       A3.12.3.3. HQ USAF/A7CH sends a copy to HQ USAF/JA for review and
       determination of legal sufficiency. Complaints found legally sufficient by HQ USAF/JA
       are processed according to DoDI 1100.16.
A3.13. Related Complaints:
   A3.13.1. When the Housing Flight Chief receives more than one complaint against the same
   agent or facility, the complaints may be consolidated for the purpose of the inquiry, legal
   review, Commander’s memorandum, and forwarding action. However, the consolidated case
   file should include a separate HUD Form 903 for each complainant.
   A3.13.2. When the Housing Flight Chief receives a second complaint against the same agent
   or facility after finalizing an unsubstantiated complaint report, a new investigation must be
   initiated.
   A3.13.3. When housing management receives a complaint against an agent or facility
   already under restrictive sanctions, the Commander:
       A3.13.3.1. Sends a summary of the facts about the new complaint to the MAJCOM, an
       analysis of the extent to which it and related information affects the prior report and
       supporting documentation.
       A3.13.3.2. Sends the complaint to other agencies, as required.
       A3.13.3.3. Informs the complainant of the action taken on the prior complaint, plus any

following actions:
   A3.14.1. Coordinates the investigation and case processing with HUD, DOJ and state or
   local representatives.
   A3.14.2. Regularly follows up with HUD area or regional office on the status until HUD
   resolves or closes the complaint.
   A3.14.3. Informs the complainant about information received and action being taken by
   HUD or DOJ.
   A3.14.4. Make sure DoD personnel comply with the restrictive sanctions imposed on the
   facility or agent.

       commuting area of the installation are prohibited from entering into a rental, purchase or
       lease arrangement with an agent of a facility under restrictive sanctions.
       A3.14.4.2. Restrictive sanctions do not apply to DoD personnel who are residing in a
       facility at the time the restrictive sanction is imposed, or who wish to renew or extend a
       rental or lease agreement begun before the restrictive sanctions were imposed.
 128                  AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


       A3.14.4.3. Relocation of a military tenant within a restricted facility is prohibited
       without the written approval of the Commander.
   A3.14.5. Establish procedures to ensure DoD personnel are informed about current
   restrictive sanctions, and establish controls to determine where a member finally locates
   housing. If a military member takes residency in a restricted facility, contrary to instructions,
   the Commander takes administrative or appropriate disciplinary action.
   A3.14.6. As a minimum, publish a current list of facilities on restrictive sanction in the base
   bulletin and newspaper when there has been an addition, deletion, or change to the list. Also,
   publicize the list through other appropriate media, such as newcomer briefings and
   commander calls.
A3.15. Removing Restrictive Sanctions:
   A3.15.1. Remove restrictive sanctions under the following circumstances.
       A3.15.1.1. Upon request, HQ USAF/A7CH may approve a waiver to lift the restrictive
       sanctions before the 180-calendar day limit for unusual or exceptional circumstances. For
       example, the discriminatory act was a single action of the manager but the owner has a
       nondiscriminatory rental policy, has forbidden the discriminatory practice or has replaced
       the agent. Submit the request to waive the 180-day calendar day limit through the
       MAJCOM to HQ USAF/A7CH, and:
          A3.15.1.1.1. Outline the agent’s action to correct the situation.
          A3.15.1.1.2. Provide the agent’s commitment, in writing, to stop further
          discrimination.
          A3.15.1.1.3. Outline the agent’s affirmative action to ensure nondiscriminatory
          policy in the future.
          A3.15.1.1.4. Provide other supporting data, such as the number of minorities
          currently residing in the facilities and the number of units.
          A3.15.1.1.5. Describe the positive result on the civilian and military communities if
          restrictive sanctions are removed before the 180-calendar day minimum ends.
       A3.15.1.2. When the 180-calendar day period ends, remove restrictive sanctions if the
       agent provides a written assurance of future nondiscrimination policy to the Housing
       Flight. As determined locally, the agent or base official may initiate the assurance, but the
       Commander’s decision to remove the restrictive sanctions must be supported by the
       written assurance.
   A3.15.2. The Commander informs the Housing Flight Chief, social actions officer, public
   affairs officer and the agent, in writing, when the facility is removed from the restrictive
   sanctions list.
A3.16. Processing Inquiries Under the Privacy Act (PA) and Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA). Process PA and FOIA requests for information as outlined in DoDR 5400.7/AF
Supplement, AF FOIA Program, or AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program, as applicable.
A3.17. Complaints Made Outside the United States. Upon receiving a complaint of
discrimination, the Housing Flight:
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                       129


   A3.17.1. Consults with the JA to determine if the Status of Forces Agreement or other host
   nation or local laws, conflict with actions outlined in this AFI.
   A3.17.2. Takes action outlined in this AFI, except a HUD Form 903 is not required. Do not
   send complaints from outside the United States to HUD or DOJ. Inform the complainant that
   the fair housing provisions of the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and 1968 do not apply outside
   the United States.
   A3.17.3. Determines, with JA counsel, how to pursue the discrimination complaint, based on
   laws of the host nation.
A3.18. Referring Complaints to Other Agencies:
   A3.18.1. If the complainant requests the complaint and supporting documents be sent to
   HUD for action under the Civil Rights Act of 1968, the Commander sends the original
   complaint and the HUD Form 903 to Fair Housing, HUD, Washington DC 20410-9000.
      A3.18.1.1. Forward the HUD Form 903 to HUD at the time the complainant reports the
      incident to a housing representative. To take action, HUD must receive the complaint
      within 180 days of the alleged discrimination. To ensure meeting the 180-day
      requirement, send the complaint to HUD before initiating the preliminary inquiry and
      subsequent procedures.
      A3.18.1.2. Recommend the Commander also send a copy of the complaint to the local
      HUD regional office, but state in the transmittal memorandum that the complaint is being
      sent to HUD headquarters and other agencies for action or information.
   A3.18.2. When forwarding a complaint to HUD, send an information copy of the complaint
   and the investigative report to the DOJ, Civil Rights Division, Washington, DC 20530-2001.
   At the request of the complainant, also send an action copy to DOJ, including a
   memorandum that informs DOJ of other agencies to which the report was submitted.
   A3.18.3. If allowed by the Commander or if the complainant requests, send an information
   copy of the complaint report to state and local agencies in the US and in OCONUS locations
   that take legal action on housing discrimination complaints. Summarize the discrimination in
   a cover memorandum, and list all agencies to which the report was submitted.

   USAF/A7C must notify SAF/IEI and USAF Housing, Inc. of approval to demolish Capehart
   and Wherry units.
AFI32-6001_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                           133


   A5.3.2. The number of units to be demolished is identified for a MILCON project on DD
   Form 1391, Military Construction Project Data, (specific units are not identified).
   However, HQ AF has no visibility for which units are inadequate or surplus (or both), or
   whether the units are owned by USAF Housing, Inc, (Capehart and Wherry) and require
   SAF/IEI notification.
   A5.3.3. Upon authorization of a MILCON project that includes disposal of family housing
   units, HQ USAF/A7C approval is required, on a by unit basis, for all units to be disposed of
   as part of a project. Upon approval for disposal, HQ USAF/A7C will make the appropriate

            Historic assessments, as needed
            Walking Shield Program considerations, where appropriate
   A5.3.4. Unlike privatization, the AF is not required to obtain a release from the lease-interest
   owned by USAF Housing, Inc for housing units disposed of as a result of a MILCON project
   since the AF will retain control of the land. The corporation and SAF/GCN do not support
   pursuing the release of the lease-interest.
A5.4. Demolition of Surplus MFH with O&M Funding.
   A5.4.1. Identify and program requirements for demolishing FH units in the IFHMP.
   Demolition not identified through conveyance in privatization or through a MILCON project

            Walking Shield Program considerations, where appropriate
   A5.4.3. Unlike privatization, the AF is not required to obtain a release from the lease-interest
   owned by USAF, Inc for FH units disposed of as a result of an O&M project since the AF
   will retain control of the land. The corporation and SAF/GCN do not support pursuing the
   release of the lease-interest.
A5.5. Conversion of Family Housing (FH) Units to Other Uses.
   A5.5.1. Conversions of FH units for other uses require SAF/IEI approval.
   A5.5.2. FH units determined to be surplus to the installation based on the current HRMA
   may be converted to other uses. Only units considered adequate based on the HCP CAM
   may be converted. Units considered inadequate due to functional suitability deficiencies, but
   otherwise in adequate condition, may be converted (AFI 32-9002). To justify conversion,
   include information identified in Attachment 4.
   A5.5.3. Surplus FH units may not be diverted (temporarily converted).
A5.6. Divestiture of MFH Units Via Conveyance to Host Nation
   A5.6.1. Methods. Only four methods are authorized for divesting MFH units in foreign
   OCONUS locations: Permanent conversion, demolition, lease termination and conveyance
   to host nation. Any other method requires approval of HQ USAF/A7CH.
   A5.6.2. Permanent Conversion.       Follow guidelines in Attachment 4 for permanently
   converting MFH units.
   A5.6.3. Demolition. MFH units may be demolished as part of a MILCON project or as a
   separately identified RPMC project.
   A5.6.4. Early Lease Termination. Early termination of leased housing units reduces the
   period of commitment in the lease agreement and may result in a financial penalty. Submit
   waiver requests for early termination, including a full justification and cost benefit analysis,
   to HQ USAF/A7CH for approval.
   A5.6.5. Conveyance to Host Nation: Units identified for conveyance to the host nation will
   be considered divested when (a) the last occupant moves out, and (b) the host nation has been
   notified of the desire to transfer. Code units pending transfer inactive in ACES.
