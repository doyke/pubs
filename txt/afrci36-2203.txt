                                                Chapter 1

                                           INTRODUCTION

1.1. Primary Mission:
    1.1.1. The primary mission of AFRC is to train personnel for active duty mobilization. Training levels
    have a direct effect on unit readiness and the safety of personnel and equipment. AF mobilization
    requirements assume reserve units are combat ready and fully prepared to execute assigned mobiliza-
    tion missions.

1.2. Accountability for Personnel:
    1.2.1. All Training Managers (TMs) must ensure that proper documentation occurs within the organi-
    zation in accordance with established standards as a consultant and advisor for the unit. This may
    necessitate training classes for supervisors to ensure their understanding of the Career Field Education
    and Training Plan (CFETP) for their areas of responsibility.

1.3. The Proficiency of Personnel:
    1.3.1. The proficiency of personnel performing the daily mission is critical to the overall mission.
    The desired proficiency can only be attained through a well organized, controlled, and continuous
    training program. The objective of the training program is to develop and implement training that
    teaches job essential skills in an effective and timely manner. Coordinating, standardizing, and pro-
    viding support and assistance at all levels is key to a successful training program.

                                                Chapter 2

                           TRAINING MANAGER RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. Training Manager Responsibilities:
   2.1.1. To identify and plan for training, you must know the mission of your organization and be famil-
   iar with how each section supports that mission. This knowledge is essential for communications with
   work center personnel. Effective TMs understand the Design Operations Capabilities (DOC) state-
   ment, the Unit Manning Document (UMD), and the Unit Type Code (UTC).
   2.1.2. The Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) is the method of reporting a unit’s
   capability to meet the mission. This report is broken down into equipment and trained personnel, and
   identifies to headquarters the ability of the unit to support the UTC. The TM should be familiar with
   the SORTS process to ensure that information in the report accurately reflects personnel readiness and
   training deficiencies.
   2.1.3. Planning is essential to ensure training programs are producing qualified personnel with a min-
   imum of expended resources. When required, TMs assist in the coordination and development of the
   Annual Training Plan (ATP) for the organization.

2.2. Master Training Plans:
   2.2.1. Master Training Plans (MTPs) are developed at various levels for almost every type of training.
   Each work center must have a MTP. The purpose of any training plan is to ensure resources are avail-
   able to support and meet standardized training objectives.
   2.2.2. MTPs should include any document or information that is pertinent to managing the work cen-
   ter’s training. Supporting documentation can be found in AFI 36-2201, Volume 3, On -The -Job
   Training Administration, and AFI 36-2201, Volume 5, Career Field Education and Training.
   2.2.3. A couple of items to include in the MTP are:
      2.2.3.1. Master Task Listing (MTL) (include duty and wartime task listing)
      2.2.3.2. Work center training requirements list from the Automated Training Subsystem (ATS)
      2.2.3.3. The MTP will cover 100 percent of work center tasks in the CFETP, AF Forms (IMT)
      797 and AF AMT 1098, and Milestones. Milestones are an approximate time line for the comple-
      tion of these tasks to include CDC progression. Do not create unrealistic goals. (Attachment 2)
      2.2.3.4. Supervisors must ensure that for every task on the MTL there is someone in the work cen-
      ter who is qualified on the task. While it should be the goal, there is no requirement to have every-
      one qualified on all tasks.

2.3. Training Schedules:
   2.3.1. The TM will plan for formal schools, Unit Training Assemblies (UTAs), and unit annual train-
   ing (annual tour status), as well as equipment, facilities, and materials needed to fully support training
   objectives.
   2.3.2. Accomplish training schedules as conditions warrant, monthly as well as annually. UTA train-
   ing schedules should ensure we conduct adequate, cost efficient training.
10                                                                        AFRCI36-2203 7 JUNE 2006


     2.3.3. The following is a suggestion for developing a training schedule:
        2.3.3.1. The TM submits their annual requirements to base agencies and requests an annual fore-
        cast of seat/quota availability for planning purposes.
        2.3.3.2. Base Education and Training Manager (BETM) will establish testing schedules and
        ensure adequate times exist throughout the month for unit personnel to accomplish testing with
        minimal impact on the mission.
        2.3.3.3. Units owning their own Test Control Facility (TCF) will publish their own schedule fol-
        lowing the same guidelines.

2.4. Occupational Survey Report (OSR):
     2.4.1. The TM is the unit’s Point Of Contact (POC) for the AF Occupational Survey Program. There
     are three types of surveys: Job Inventories, Training Emphasis, and Task Difficulty. The AF Occupa-
     tional Measurement Squadron (AFOMS), located at Randolph AFB TX, develops these surveys, then
     compiles and analyzes the results. Higher headquarters uses this analysis as a tool to make decisions
     concerning Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) direction, eliminations, formal training, CFETP
     requirements, and CDCs.
        2.4.1.1. AFOMS uses a web-based method to deliver surveys. AFOMS forwards a “task order”
        to the unit, normally through the Survey Control Monitor, with directions for logging into the
        appropriate web site to take the survey. It is the TM’s responsibility to ensure members complete
        the web-based surveys. Occupational Survey Completion Reports can be viewed at AFOMS/OA
        Occupational Analysis Flight website.
        2.4.1.2. The TM will develop a tracking method to ensure timely completion of the surveys. You
        must give a briefing explaining the procedures and importance of the surveys to include the sus-
        pense date.
     2.4.2. The importance of these surveys cannot be overemphasized. Without accurate data gathered
     from these surveys, AFRC may end up living with policies implemented by active duty that do not
     support “AFRC-unique” mission requirements. Surveys provide the statistical differences in what
     AFRC personnel do daily compared to active duty.

2.5. Graduate Assessment Survey (GAS):
     2.5.1. This is an Air Education and Training Command (AETC) survey for recent technical school
     graduates to determine if the school was a positive experience as well as an effective learning tool.
     This short survey provides feedback from the supervisor to determine if the outcome meets with their
     expectations for the course. This feedback is both internal to AETC as well as external to the major
     commands (MAJCOMs). Surveys are used to identify training requirements and standards and have
     become web based with a tasking normally sent to units two to four months after the student gradu-
     ates.
     2.5.2. The GAS surveys have a 90-day suspense for AFRC and will be tracked by the TM (Attach-
     ment 3).
AFRCI36-2203 7 JUNE 2006                                                                                11


2.6. Base Education & Training Office (BETO) Personnel Processing:
   2.6.1. Base in-processing. BETO will ensure members in-processing receive educational and
   On-the-Job Training (OJT) briefings.
   2.6.2. Base out-processing. BETO provides members with an educational briefing and verifies for-
   mal school and CDC status.
   2.6.3. BETO, in conjunction with Personnel Employment, develops procedures to ensure all incom-
   ing and outgoing personnel process through the BETO. Procedures may vary.
   2.6.4. Unit in-processing. TM will initiate AF Form 623, On-the-Job Training Record, with the
   appropriate CFETP and any combination of forms required by the unit such as:
       2.6.4.1. The preprinted AF Form 623a reflecting the TM’s initial trainee interview and orientation
       (Attachment 4).
       2.6.4.2. Supervisor’s initial evaluation (Attachment 5).
       2.6.4.3. Supervisor/TM 24-month interview (Attachment 6).
       2.6.4.4. 24 month Trainee review as required (Attachment 7).
       2.6.4.5. Forward the training record to the appropriate supervisor.
NOTE: Requirements for conducting TM training orientation are listed in AFI 36-2201, volume 3,
attachment 5. TMs will devise an interview, orientation, and initial evaluation tracking device to ensure
timely completion (Attachment 8).
       2.6.4.6. Adjust Date Entered Training to date member arrives at unit, if required.
       2.6.4.7. Ensure formal school requests are processed in accordance with local directives.
       2.6.4.8. Verify CDC history in Career Development/Student Assistance/Registrar (CDSAR).

2.7. Unit Out-Processing:
   2.7.1. For reassignment/separation, TM reviews the individual’s training record and gives all training
   related material, including automated products, to the individual.
   2.7.2. If the member is being reassigned and is enrolled in a CDC, ensure the member has all course
   materials. Brief the member about the importance of changing the TCF number with AF Institute for
   Advance Distributive Learning (AFIADL) when in-processing their gaining unit. If a Course Exam
   (CE) has not been forwarded, the losing BETO must be contacted to transfer the CE to the gaining
   TCF.
   2.7.3. TMs will ensure they are on the unit’s orderly room in- and out-processing checklist.

2.8. Civilian Training Requirements:
   2.8.1. The authority for setting up objectives, requirements, and assigned responsibilities for the con-
   duct and administration of training and development for appropriated fund civilian employees is AFI
   36-401, Employee Training and Development.

                                 AUTOMATED TRAINING SYSTEMS

4.1. Automated Training Systems (ATS):
     4.1.1. Automated Training Systems may be utilized to document training if authorized by the career
     field functional manager. You can use them for all or any part of the training documentation process.
     There are several different types of approved ATS, e.g., Access database, and several AFSC created
     systems. Consult the appropriate manuals for specific guidance.
     4.1.2. The unit must ensure that there is reasonable security in place to avoid erroneous updates in the
     ATS. A source document must be used to verify the training was accomplished prior to updating the
     ATS. One suggestion for accountability and for use as a source document is an AF Form 2426, Train-
     ing Request and Completion Notification.
     4.1.3. Automated CFETPs can only be used on approved AF systems. A hard copy of the CFETP
     must be used when requesting training waivers from HQ AFRC/A1TS.

                     MANAGING ADVANCED DISTRIBUTED LEARNING

5.1. Managing Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL):
   5.1.1. In order to provide access to training delivered via Distance Learning (DL) to assigned person-
   nel the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) at each installation must be familiar with the processes
   and procedures used to manage an advanced DL program. Information in this chapter supplements
   information contained in AFI 36-2201, Volume 4, Managing Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL).

5.2. Definitions:
   5.2.1. Learning is the acquisition of knowledge, skills, and attitudes through the integration of educa-
   tion, training, and performance aiding in a comprehensive, mutually supportive system.
   5.2.2. Distributed Learning is structured learning that takes place without the physical presence of the
   instructor. Technology enhances DL. It may draw upon resources which are physically distant from
   the location where learning is taking place and may include the use of one or more of the following
   media: Correspondence course materials, audio/videotapes, CD ROMs, audio/video tele-training,
   interactive television, and video conferencing to provide right-time, right-place learning.

5.3. Advanced Distributed Learning:
   5.3.1. Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) leverages the full power of computer, information, and
   communication technologies using common standards in order to provide learning that is tailored to
   individual needs and delivered anytime, anywhere.
   5.3.2. ADL also includes establishing an interoperable “computer-managed instruction” environment
   that supports the needs of developers, learners, instructors, administrators, managers, and family.
   ADL encompasses all the methodologies mentioned above, and in addition, includes ongoing and
   expected improvements in learning methodologies.

5.4. Delivery methods:
   5.4.1. Computer-Based ADL:
   Computer-based ADL is emerging as a viable source of instruction for initial, proficiency, and skills
   enhancement training. There are several different terms and acronyms used to describe different types
   of computer training. They include Interactive Courseware (ICW), Computer Based Training (CBT),
   and Web Based Training (WBT). Typically, they each involve a student participating in a lesson
   given by the software on the computer. The student interacts with the computer program and the com-
   puter measures how well the student grasps the material presented.
   5.4.2. Upon completion of the lesson, the student is tested either through the computer (automated) or
   written (paper) test. These tests may be graded immediately or in some cases the test must be returned
   to the authoring organization for grading.
   5.4.3. Video Tele-Training (VTT).
16                                                                         AFRCI36-2203 7 JUNE 2006


     Air Technology Network (ATN) is a satellite-based education and training network that provides
     delivery of distance learning through interactive television broadcasting. ATN is a one-way video/
     two-way audio satellite network.
     5.4.4. Other Delivery Methods. Other ADL technologies include media that you are already familiar
     with such as correspondence, videotape, and telephone. These technologies will continue to play a
     large role in the training programs of our personnel now and in the future. Each ADL media has its
     positive, as well as negative, aspects.
     5.4.5. As a training issue is identified, the best media or combination of media called blended learning
     will be selected in order to obtain the desired training objective.

5.5. Managing DL/ADL Computer Resources:
     5.5.1. Ensuring laptop computer availability to complete ICW, CBT and WBT courses and desktop
     computer availability to administer automated end-of-course tests is critical in order to sustain a DL/
     ADL program. Wing Training will:
        5.5.1.1. Ensure there is availability of laptops for “sign out” by base personnel, and desktop com-
        puters for testing.
        5.5.1.2. Utilize appropriate request procedures to ensure sufficient computer systems are avail-
        able to meet current as well as future projected requirements.
        5.5.1.3. Establish local sign out procedures for available resources in order to meet DL training
        requirements. Procedures should address utilization of individual, unit, group, and wing assets.
     5.5.2. Laptop computers used for distance learning sign out and desk top computers used to support
     automated testing that have been provided to Wing Training offices by HQ AFRC to support a DL/
     ADL program must be utilized for their intended purpose and not be redirected for use elsewhere or
     swapped out with older systems. Any computers designated as a testing computer must adhere to the
     following criteria:
        5.5.2.1. Set up as stand-alone machines.
        5.5.2.2. Do not use for any purpose other than automated testing.
        5.5.2.3. If moved, transferred, or no longer used for testing, erase and reformat the hard drive
        5.5.2.4. Do not connect to any type of networked system, i.e., Local Area Network, Wide Area
        Network, Internet, etc. since this could allow unauthorized personnel access from remote comput-
        ers and lead to a possible test compromise.
        Exception: You can network testing computers together within the testing room but cannot have
        an outside network connection. This exception facilitates system updates/upgrades and the use of
        a networked printer.

5.6. Security:
     5.6.1. The following requirements are in addition to the proper testing conditions listed in the AFI-
     ADL Testing Conditions and specific electronic testing guidance available or distributed with a par-
     ticular course or exam. Compliance with these requirements will strengthen our program against test
     compromises. Secure automated test stations in units where the testing room is used as a multifunc-
AFRCI36-2203 7 JUNE 2006                                                                              17


  tion room to prevent unauthorized use or access of the computer. These security measures will be
  used since test materials can be transferred to the PCs hard disk drive and subsequently accessed later
  thus constituting a test compromise situation. Any one or combination of the following security mea-
  sures is appropriate:
     5.6.1.1. Use of the PC equipped lock out key. If equipped, this lockout device must perform one
     or more of the following functions: (1) prevent the computer from being turned on, (2) locks out
     use of the keyboard and mouse, or (3) stops the PC during its boot-up process.
     5.6.1.2. Use of a Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) password (NOT the Win-
     dows screen saver password).
     5.6.1.3. On NT/Win2000/XP systems, the use of the administrator’s password can be used to con-
     trol access. The administrator password must be controlled in the same manner as a safe password
     that contains controlled testing material, and it should be changed periodically to prevent compro-
     mise. Consult with Work Group Administrators for controlling access to computers.
  5.6.2. PC Hardware and Software Requirements. PCs utilized as automated testing devices must, as
  a minimum, meet the requirements established by AFIADL, HQ AFRC/A6, HQ AFRC/A1T and/or
  the training provider’s system requirements required to run their specific software program. Any PCs
  acquired from other agencies must also meet these minimum hardware configurations.
  5.6.3. When possible, units purchasing Automated Data Processing Equipment (ADPE) should
  always acquire the most current technology available.
  5.6.4. When Command purchased ADPE or replacement equipment to support automated testing is
  distributed or designated to replace previously distributed ADPE, then that particular systems hard-
  ware capabilities will thus become the standard system. Cooperation and understanding with respect
  to distribution of ADPE when purchased for automated testing is required.
  5.6.5. The Command must be able to maintain a set standard system capability throughout all wing
  training functions. This standard system capability is subsequently used to report AFRC capabilities
  to other agencies to show Command capabilities to support evolving versions of testing software and
  related programs.
  5.6.6. Local substitution of ADPE below the standard only hinders the learning/comprehension level
  and can significantly distract an individual in a test environment when faced with unneeded delays
  due to substandard technology.
  5.6.7. Arrangement. The Test Control Officer/monitor/examiner must be able to monitor all comput-
  ers at one time while official testing is in progress.
  5.6.8. In testing rooms using two or more PCs for automated testing, arrange PCs in a manner that
  prevents the computer screen from being read by another individual taking an automated or written
  test. When it is necessary to position two or more PCs side-by-side, install a suitable divider or con-
  figure monitors to prevent the screen from being viewed by adjacent testing positions/stations.
  5.6.9. When test stations are intended for use with both automated and paper-based tests, give consid-
  eration to appropriate technology and ergonomic design features that will best support the multiuse
  nature of the facility.
18                                                                             AFRCI36-2203 7 JUNE 2006


5.7. Automated Testing Facility Requirements:
     5.7.1. Automated testing has the same facility requirements as traditional paper-based testing. Units
     registered with AFIADL as Test Control Offices, administering automated tests or establishing an
     automated testing capability, will ensure a testing room is established.
     5.7.2. Test facilities and/or rooms should meet the square footage requirements identified in AFRC
     Handbook 32-1001, Standard Facility Requirements.
     5.7.3. Existing test facilities may be used provided ample space is available to support both auto-
     mated and traditional testing requirements.

5.8. Automated Test Administration:
     5.8.1. Perform proper test administration for DL/ADL courses in accordance with specific policy and
     guidance listed in AFI 36-2201, AFIADL Catalog, or supporting documentation for each com-
     puter-based test as specified by the course administrator.
     5.8.2. Designate an individual to administrate the applicable DL/ADL test program. For AFIADL
     courses, designate an AFIADL Test Control Officer (TCO). For Type 6 AETC courses, designate a
     Job Site Training Point of Contact, and for Defense Activity for Non Traditional Educational Services
     (DANTES) tests, designate a DANTES Test Control Officer.
     5.8.3. When a new test is released, a review of the specific guidance and testing procedures published
     by the OPR must be completed.
     5.8.4. To ensure the correct test is administered for the right student the following procedures will be
     adhered to:
        5.8.4.1. Do not wait until the morning of the test session to check CDSAR.
        5.8.4.2. Check CDSAR as soon as the student makes an appointment for testing.
        5.8.4.3. Do a screen print of the CDSAR screen showing the eligible E-Exam numbers.
        5.8.4.4. Add the student to E-Exam and unlock the test. Make a note on the screen print which test
        was unlocked.
        5.8.4.5. Place the screen prints in a test session folder and retain until after the test.
        5.8.4.6. If the student passes the test, mark the screen print and file it with working files according
        to local guidance.
        5.8.4.7. If the student fails the test, annotate the screen print for the student and place it in a retake
        folder.
        5.8.4.8. When the student returns to retake the exam, check the retake folder for the screen print
        and determine which test to unlock for the retake.
        5.8.4.9. If you don’t have a screen print, view the student’s record in E-Exam. This shows tests
        taken. Except for PME courses where there is a single test number, do not unlock a test already
        taken for a retake. Unlock the one that has not been given.
        5.8.4.10. If the student is TDY to your location and not assigned to your base, be sure to check
        CDSAR and do a screen print before allowing the student to test.
AFRCI36-2203 7 JUNE 2006                                                                                 19


5.9. Managing Computer Based Training:
   5.9.1. Due to variables from base to base, wing training functions must establish their own local pol-
   icies for managing a CBT program. Since there are several owning organizations or training provid-
   ers that distribute computer based training, applicable policy and guidance from these providers must
   be incorporated into local policy.
   5.9.2. For additional guidance, see the HQ AFRC/A1T web site for links to the AFRC Distance
   Learning Guide, Distance Learning Site Managers Handbook and AETC’s Live Guide.

5.10. Air Technology Network (ATN):
   5.10.1. Managing ATN Downlink Classrooms (referred to as Classroom), the wing training office
   and the Primary Job Site Training Point of Contact (JST POC) a.k.a. Administrative Site Coordinator
   (ASC) and Technical Site Coordinator (TSC) have overall responsibility of Air Technology Network
   operations at their wing. All classrooms, regardless of location (these are the A, B, C and D rooms)
   are still training assets and, as such, the Wing Training Office should have oversight as to their opera-
   tions and operational status and assign POCs (explained below) as needed, to be responsible for these
   classrooms. Wing Training must ensure that:
      5.10.1.1. Each classroom has a designated ASC and TSC. This individual may be one and the
      same or two different individuals. We recommend you assign an alternate ASC and TSC. These
      individuals are responsible for scheduling, setup, testing and operation of each ATN classroom.
      5.10.1.2. All designated ASC and TSC names must be reported to the Air Technology Network
      Program Management Office (ATN PMO) as contacts for the particular room or site ID they are
      assigned. Keep this information current at all times. The ATN Site Contact Listing on the ATN
      PMO web site must be current and promptly updated. Send updates to this listing directly to the
      ATN PMO. If you have additional classrooms that do not fall under a single ASC and TSC, you
      should have the ATN PMO add a new entry for these additional rooms/POCs.
      5.10.1.3. Individuals who manage Type 6, AETC training and scheduling, are identified as JST
      POC. All designated JST POCs must be listed on the JST POC listing with 2AF/DOTT. Updates
      to the listing should be sent directly to HQ AFRC/A1TP. Primary JST POCs or the Chief of
      Training are the only authorized individuals to send updates. HQ AFRC/A1TP will then update
      the 2AF/DOTT listing. The listing must be kept accurate and current at all times.
      5.10.1.4. Operational status of all ATN classrooms must be reported directly to the ATN PMO.
      Ensure applicable information listed on the site status is accurate and complete. Incorrect infor-
      mation reported on this site (IRD-U/A and Audio Bridge numbers) will result in not being able to
      receive a broadcast. Do not send status changes to HQ AFRC. HQ AFRC uses the ATN PMO site
      to determine Command operational status.
      5.10.1.5. ASCs, TSCs and JST POCs are trained in their assigned duties.
   5.10.2. ATN Program Management Training. Wing Training will ensure:
      5.10.2.1. Individuals involved in scheduling AETC related broadcasting are designated as a JST
      POC. Every JST POC must initially attend Site Coordinator Training broadcasted quarterly over
      ATN and should make every effort to attend all quarterly broadcasts to obtain new updates to pro-
      cess and procedures.
20                                                                         AFRCI36-2203 7 JUNE 2006


        5.10.2.2. Individuals designated as ASCs and TSCs and/or JST POCs must read and understand
        information contained in the Air Technology Network Users Guide, Quick Reference Guide for
        ATN Troubleshooting, 2AF/DOTT Live Guide and the AFRC Distance Learning Handbook with
        emphasis on information related to classroom equipment configuration, operation and setup.
        These individuals should also know how to contact HQ AFRC/A1TP, ATN PMO, Audio Bridge
        Operator, Broadcast Origination Center and Convergent Media Help Desk when there are prob-
        lems associated with equipment operation or availability. Links to the guides and handbook are
        available on the HQ AFRC/A1TS web site. For additional guidance and information, contact the
        Command Distance Learning Program Manager (HQ AFRC/A1TP) for assistance.
     5.10.3. ATN Downlink Classroom Setup/Configurations. TSCs will:
        5.10.3.1. Check the operational status of their classroom periodically when not used, at least 5
        business days prior to any scheduled broadcast as well as the day before, to ensure operational sta-
        tus. TSCs must know how to operate and test the equipment. Instructions on how to do this are
        available on the HQ AFRC/A1TP web page.
        5.10.3.2. Immediately report equipment problems to the Convergent Media Help Desk at
        1-888-236-0855. If there are continued/unresolved problems with the equipment or with the ser-
        vice provided by Convergent Media, the problem should be reported to HQ AFRC/A1T. You do
        not need to report help desk problems or service calls to the HQ unless as stated above, you have
        continued/unresolved problems.
        5.10.3.3. Be present at least 30 minutes prior to broadcast start to resolve any technical problems.
        ASCs should ensure that a Quick Reference Guide for ATN Troubleshooting is available to
        quickly resolve any technical problems.

5.11. ATN Troubleshooting:
     5.11.1. Equipment problems may require you to have a help desk technician guide you through test-
     ing of the equipment. This can be difficult if the ATN classroom does not have a phone line in the
     room. Even with a hard-wired phone this can be difficult for various reasons. It is highly suggested
     that you either locally purchase a cordless phone and/or at least have a second phone line installed in
     all ATN classrooms to assist in troubleshooting equipment problems with technicians.
     5.11.2. Be sure to check with your local Communications Representative for applicable rules govern-
     ing wireless communication devices before you purchase a cordless phone.

5.12. Requests For Installation:
     5.12.1. Additions, relocations, or changes to new or existing ATN downlink classroom/configura-
     tions must be submitted to HQ AFRC/A1TP. Requests will be reviewed and either approved, adjusted
     or disapproved.
     5.12.2. Disapprovals or adjustments to requests may be made at the discretion of HQ AFRC/A1TP
     and are based on, but not limited to, current ATN viewing capabilities at the requested location, the
     number of new classrooms being requested, current and future network distribution systems, available
     funding, equipment availability for other than ATN specific equipment and other requirements stipu-
     lated in the ATN Downlink Request Document.

                                                 Chapter 6

                                     TRAINING CLASSIFICATION

6.1. Training Classification:
     6.1.1. Individuals are classified according to their position within the training structure. The AF IMT
     2096, Classification/On-the-Job Training, or automated system is used to assign personnel to autho-
     rized positions consistent with requirements, individual grades, and skill levels. It may also be used to
     award, downgrade, and withdraw AFSCs and Special Equipment Identifiers (SEIs). The immediate
     supervisor or Personnel Employment section, in coordination with the training manager, may initiate
     classification action according to AFMAN 36-2108, Enlisted Classification, and Air Force Manual
     (AFMAN) 36-606, Volume 1, Air Force Civilian Career Program Management.

6.2. CFETP Requirements:
     6.2.1. Before any skill level upgrade may occur, all CFETP requirements must be met. This includes
     items such as minimum time requirements, CDCs, mandatory schools, CBT, core tasks, and any addi-
     tional duty position tasks identified as mandatory by the supervisor and functional manager. Support-
     ing documentation may be found in AFI 36-2201, Volume 3, AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military
     Personnel (Officers and Enlisted), AFMAN 36-2105, Officer Classification, and AFMAN 36-2108,
     Enlisted Classification.

6.3. One Levels:
     6.3.1. One levels are a unique resource. They have entered the Air Force Reserve; however, have yet
     to enter upgrade training. Special considerations to their status must be adhered to. One levels should
     not be used for menial details.
     6.3.2. They cannot perform the following:
        6.3.2.1. Hands-on tasks/training. One levels can observe tasks being performed.
        6.3.2.2. Any related AFSC knowledge training that requires evaluation, except for attending Air
        Force Reserve sanctioned alternative training.
        6.3.2.3. Active Duty Training nor can they voluntarily retrain. (Reference AFMAN 36-8001,
        Chapter 6, Reference Personnel Participation and Training Procedures).
        6.3.2.4. Members in Training Status Code (TSC) M cannot be enrolled in CDCs, as they are test-
        able and intended to accompany hands on upgrade training, however, one-levels can be given
        work center copies of CDCs for familiarization purposes. All efforts should be taken to gain a 3

                                              Chapter 8

          CAREER DEVELOPMENT COURSE (CDC) PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

8.1. The CDC Program:
   8.1.1. Perhaps the most important responsibility for the TM is the CDC Program.
   8.1.2. The CDC Brief will be documented on AF IMT 623a by the TM and supervisor (Attachment
   9). The briefing explains the trainee and supervisor’s responsibilities and establishes the CDC sched-
   ule (Attachment 9). The schedule includes the projected and actual completion dates. You must doc-
   ument deviations from the projected date.
   8.1.3. The CDCs are knowledge based, therefore, the trainee is required to recall information he/she
   has read. The fact that they did not work on a particular type of equipment or perform the task cov-
   ered in the CDCs is not an excuse for failure or justification for a waiver.

8.2. Course Examinations (CE):
   8.2.1. Ensure supervisors and trainees accomplish a comprehensive review of all material prior to
   administration of the CE. The TM notifies the supervisor to schedule trainee for testing.

8.3. CDC Extensions:
   8.3.1. Request course extensions when events beyond the students control prevent them from meeting
   the time requirements. Supervisors must properly document slow progression in AF Form 623.
   When necessary, extensions will be requested NLT the 10th month.
   8.3.2. Request extensions through the designated automated system. Consult your BETO for local
   procedures.

8.4. Course Examination Test Failures:
   8.4.1. Course Examination First-Time Failures. The TM must ensure a commander’s evaluation is
   performed following guidance in AFI 36-2201, Volume 3, Chapter 8, Table 8.1, Line 10, and the
   supervisor understands the importance of documentation (Attachment 10). Commander must inform
   the trainee and supervisor of the options to be taken if there is a second time CDC failure.
   8.4.2. Second time failure options are as follows:
       8.4.2.1. Evaluate for possible CDC waiver (do not place the trainee into TSC T).
       8.4.2.2. Withdraw the Airman for failing to progress, place into TSC T, pursue separation.
       8.4.2.3. Withdraw the Airman for failing to progress, place into TSC T, request AFSC withdrawal
       and recommend retraining or return to previously awarded AFSC.
       8.4.2.4. Withdraw the Airman for failing to progress, place into TSC T, re-evaluate at 90 days and
       pursue either option 1, 2, 3, or 4 as appropriate.
NOTE: Unit commanders may have additional polices which will be explained during the evaluation.
26                                                                         AFRCI36-2203 7 JUNE 2006


     8.4.3. When a member fails a mandatory CDC, do not order/enroll in the next mandatory set until you
     have an approved waiver. You must have an approved waiver regardless if the failed CDC was a pre-
     requisite or not.
     8.4.4. Course Examination Second Time Failures. If there is a second CDC failure, ensure the proper
     procedures are followed.
        8.4.4.1. The TM and supervisor must understand the severity of the trainee’s situation.
        8.4.4.2. BETO will notify unit of CE failure by letter with commander’s options.
        8.4.4.3. Follow guidance in AFI 36-2201, Volume 3, Chapter 8, Table 8.1, Line 11 when conduct-
        ing the commander’s evaluation.
        8.4.4.4. Return notification letter to BETO with intended action. (Attachment 11)
        8.4.4.5. If the commander determines a waiver of the two time failure is appropriate, supervisor
        must provide projected completion submission date for the waiver.
        8.4.4.6. If time frame is over 1 year, justification must be provided to the BETO.

8.5. CDC Reactivations:
     8.5.1. Reactivations are on a case-by-case basis only. If the CDC is not completed in the allotted time
     frame, a one-time reactivation may be requested for testing purposes only.
     8.5.2. The CE should be on file when reactivation is requested. Reactivations less than 90 days from
     expiration date are approved by the unit commander (Attachment 12). Group commanders have
     approval of reactivation greater than 90 days from expiration date (Attachment 13). When the reacti-
     vation is approved, students have 90 days to complete the CE.
     8.5.3. For reactivation, consult the BETO for local policies.
     8.5.4. A reactivation is not a re-enrollment.

8.6. CDC Re-enrollments:
     8.6.1. If a CDC has expired or the CDC version has been replaced, a re-enrollment may be requested.
     8.6.2. Re-enrollments are not an option for two-time CDC failures. Follow guidance in AFI 36-2201,
     Volume 3, Chapter 8, Table 8.1, Line 13.
     8.6.3. All re-enrollments will be done in word format (.doc) and forwarded via electronic mail.
     Re-enrollments are approved at HQ AFRC/A1TS.
        8.6.3.1. Request will include steps taken to ensure re-enrollments and reactivations are kept to a
        minimum.

8.7. Specialized Courses (SC):
     8.7.1. Specialized courses are available for career enhancement. AFIADL lists all SCs available for
     enrollment. SCs may be taken on a voluntary basis, much like the DE courses.
     8.7.2. Some specialized courses may actually take the place of a CDC and be mandatory for career
     field advancement.

                                   REPORTING PROCEDURES

9.1. Reporting Procedures:
   9.1.1. There are proper procedures involved in all organizations. Units need to ensure members use
   the proper chain of command. If a TM has a question or concern, contact the local BETO. If BETO
   has a question or concern or is not able to assist the TM, the BETO will contact the NAF. If the NAF
   requires further clarification, they will contact AFRC. When the member starts at the lowest level, it
   makes the system work as designed. Information from AFRC will be disseminated back down the
   chain.
      9.1.1.1. HQ AFRC/A1TS and the NAF Chiefs have established the following key process proce-
      dures. This section outlines AFRC administrative procedures when corresponding training issues
      throughout wings, NAFs, HQ AFRC, and other agencies. NOTE: Maintenance Training Manag-
      ers (MTM) will go through maintenance channels prior to reaching BETO.

                                           WAIVER PROCESS

10.1. Waiver Process:
     10.1.1. Air Staff has granted waiver approval to HQ AFRC. To ensure integrity of the program, we
     must follow certain guidelines.
     10.1.2. In coordination with HQ AFRC, AFSC Functional Managers will use the automated training
     waiver process for all training waiver requests as authorized in AFI 36-2201, Volume 5, Chapter 4,
     and AFI 36-2101. Specifically, for all waiver requests for enlisted mandatory 3, 5 and 7-skill level
     requirements, Technical Training, Time-in-Training, and 7-Level Craftsman Courses.
     10.1.3. This waiver process applies to all AFSCs except 3E7X1, Fire Protection (INTEL waivers for
     the Modular Intelligence Training Course (MITC) are a little different). All waivers will be done in
     word format (.doc) and sent via electronic mail.
     10.1.4. Final waiver authority is at AFRC MAJCOM level.
     10.1.5. You can review the waiver process at
     https://wwwmil.afrc.af.mil/HQ/DP/DPT/OJT%20Helpful%20Information.htm.
NOTE: AFRC maintenance retraining policy is applicable on an individual basis. For specific guidance
on maintenance retraining, see Chapter 17.

10.2. Technical School Waivers:
     10.2.1. Technical school requests and technical school waivers cannot be submitted simultaneously.
     10.2.2. Do not request a waiver for a member with a training line number for a technical school, the
     waiver will be returned without action.
     10.2.3. If a member has documentation to justify a 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level waiver or any combination
     of more than one skill level, the unit can submit one waiver package with complete justification for
     multiple skills.
     10.2.4. Only the AFRC functional manager can approve/disapprove the package in its entirety or
     selected parts of the package.

10.3. The Automated Training Waiver Process Will Not Be Used For:
     10.3.1. Two-time CDC failure waivers
     10.3.2. Officer or enlisted classification waivers
     10.3.3. Technical training block waivers can be found on line at https://wwwmil.afrc.af.mil/HQ/
     DP/DPT/Formal%20Schools%20Branch%20Helpful%20Information%20Menu.htm.

10.4. CEM Codes:
     10.4.1. For award of a CEM, member must acquire an authorized feeder AFSC, which requires a 3, 5,
     and 7-skill level in the feeder AFSC or a waiver of these skill level requirements.
AFRCI36-2203 7 JUNE 2006                                                                              31


10.5. Waiver Requests:
   10.5.1. Requests must be coordinated through the BETO and the NAF prior to receipt at HQ AFRC/
   A1TS. Do not scan the word document. Waiver package will meet AFI 36-2201, Vol 5, Chapter 4
   requirements.
   10.5.2. Individual Mobilization Augumentees (IMA) coordinate waivers through their active duty
   MAJCOM AFSC Functional Manager, IMA Program Manager, and the Readiness Management
   Group (RMG) will forward to HQ AFRC/A1TS for final disposition.
NOTE: RMG will provide copies of waivers to ARPC/DPRPT
   10.5.3. All requests for mandatory formal school waivers (3-and 7-level) will arrive at HQ AFRC/
   A1TS within 6 months of reporting to the duty position.
       10.5.3.1. Waivers must be submitted within six months of approval of retraining action or be reas-
       signed to IRR or returned to a previous AFSC. OJT at home station is not allowed as criteria for
       waiver of technical training. Waivers submitted to HQ AFRC past the 6 month time frame will be
       returned with no action.
   10.5.4. Waiver requests arriving after the 6-month point must contain significant justification
   endorsed by the unit commander or IMA Program Manager (PM). NOTE: The cause of the delay
   may not always be the unit. Several waivers have been late due to administrative and coordination
   problems with the Wing Training Office. However, we will return any requests that do not include
   justification from the unit commander or IMA Program Manager.
   10.5.5. Any waiver previously disapproved by the respective MAJCOM AFSC Functional Manager
   must be resubmitted using the automated training waiver process to ensure accountability.
   10.5.6. The HQ AFRC/A1TS cover letter must indicate that it is a resubmission of a previously dis-
   approved request. The member, unit, or wing training will not contact the AFRC AFSC Functional
   Managers on waiver requests.
   10.5.7. Air Reserve Technicians (ARTs) will comply with all requirements of this waiver process.
   10.5.8. ARTs must attend technical training if initially disapproved.

      resumed when additional/new funding is made available.
      11.4.4.2. Tuition assistance is paid on a reimbursable basis, after student pays all school costs and
      successfully completes the course(s) for which TA was requested and approved.
      11.4.4.3. TA is subject to disapproval by HQ AFRC/A1TS based on circumstances and will be

   11.5.1. TA and Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) (MGIB-Chapter 30, MGIB-Chapter 31,
   MGIB-SR-Chapter 1606, and MGIB-SR Kicker) cannot be used in conjunction with the same courses
   (Title 38, Chapter 36, Section 3681 of U.S.C.).
   11.5.2. Use of MGIB and/or other “federal” benefits (excluding Pell Grants) and TA for the same
   course would constitute duplication of benefits (see DoDI 1322.25, 5 Feb 1997, para E2.1.6, E2.1.7).
   The Department of Veterans Affairs’ policy allows payment to members who are eligible for both TA
   and MGIB-SR for the same class if attending more than half-time.
   11.5.3. The component who owns the TA program must authorize and fund this before payment can
   be made. AFRC does not authorize this provision.
   11.5.4. TA and active duty MGIB may be used for the same course under the Top-Up Program. For
   additional information on Top-Up, visit the VA’s website at www.va.gov.

13.1. Definition of Active Duty Training (ADT):
   13.1.1. ADT is defined as tours to supplement Annual Tour (AT) and Inactive Duty Training (IDT)
   when the member requires additional training to achieve or maintain a required skill or skill level in
   their assigned Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC). Use Active Duty for Special Work (ADSW) tours
   to provide direct staff support to Reserve Component programs.
   13.1.2. ADT tours may be used to maintain or increase the member’s mobilization readiness in sup-
   port of Reserve needs. Authorized ADT must provide a primary training content to the member dur-
   ing tours involving organized and planned specialized skill training, flight training, combat crew
   training, unit conversion training, refresher and proficiency training, officer acquisition training, pro-
   fessional development education programs, etc.

13.2. Eligibility for ADT:
   13.2.1. Only members in training categories A, B, F, J, and P (see AFMAN 36-8001, Chapter 2,
   Tables 2.1 and 2.2) are authorized to take part in ADT tours. Fiscal year (FY) requirements will be
   performed, scheduled, substituted, or waived prior to a member performing an ADT (special). On
   ADT (special) orders requests, the requester will place the statement All FY requirements of Table
   1.1, AFMAN 36-8001, volume 1, have been performed, scheduled, substituted, or waived. For
   selected reservists, no ADT tours (special)/Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA) will be per-
   formed in the last quarter of the FY if the member’s FY requirements have not been met or scheduled.
   13.2.2. A member is not eligible to take part in ADT (other than formal schools) if
       13.2.2.1. Member possesses 1-level Control Air Force Specialty Code.
       13.2.2.2. Member is within 6 months of mandatory discharge or retirement (school tours must
       meet retainability prescribed by Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA)
       accessed on the ETCA website) and those identified in Chapter 5, Para 5.2.8.5.
       13.2.2.3. Member’s enlistment expires before the end of the tour.

13.3. General Guidelines for ADT:
   13.3.1. Commanders or their designated representatives (for unit program) and program managers
   (for IMA program) have the authority to determine the appropriate Training Category Codes (TCC) to
   be used for ADT tours and must make sure appropriate TCCs are placed on all ADT and ADSW
   orders.
   13.3.2. Program managers must use care to minimize the costs for scheduled IMA conferences by
   restricting travel and registration fee requirements as much as possible. Registration fees will not
   include costs of supporting/conducting Air Force hosted conferences or for refreshments and social
   gatherings such as icebreakers at these events.
       13.3.2.1. Whenever possible, use the Air Force’s own conference sites. (See AFI 65-601, Vol-
       ume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, OMB Bulletin 93-11, Joint Travel Regulation (JTR)
       C4950, and Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR) U2550.)

     13.3.3. Reservists are allowed to participate in HQ AFRC-level or higher morale, welfare, and recre-
     ation events sanctioned by the Department of the Air Force. Permissive temporary duty (TDY) orders
     may be issued to participants on ADT in a non-pay, points only status at no appropriated fund cost to
     the government for events which do not require selection by Air Force or a national governing body,
     but require Active Duty (AD) military status to participate.
        13.3.3.1. Permissive TDY, while at no appropriated fund cost to the government, will allow
        standby military travel and nonreimbursable lodging support. Travel from the member’s unit to
        the participation site is at member’s expense and is not reimbursable. For reservists who wish to
        participate in these programs, orders to ADT in nonpay, points only status must be approved by
        AFRC/CV. TCC HA applies. For athlete submission instructions, contact HQ AFRC/SVPR.
        Selection will be on a case-by-case basis.
        13.3.3.2. It is also possible to place a reservist on ADT with pay status if that individual is
        selected to represent AFRC in an Armed Forces National or International competition. For athlete
        submission instructions, contact HQ AFRC/SVPR. Selection will be on a case-by-case basis.
        13.3.3.3. Individual reservists selected by Headquarters United States Air Force
        (HQ USAF/RE), to attend Confederation of Reserve Medical Officers (CIOR)/Interallied Interal-
        lied Confederation of Reserve Medical Officers (CIORM) for logistical support are required to
        submit their AF IMT 1289, Application for Active Duty Training (RPA tour), or completed Air
        Force Order Writing System (AROWS) request, which has coordination from their program man-
        ager, to HQ AFRC/A1XY. HQ AFRC/A1XY will forward the AF IMT 1289 or completed
        AROWS-R request along with the memorandum signed by HQ USAF/RE, directing which mem-
        bers will be placed on paid orders and members who will be on Permissive TDY orders to HQ
        ARPC/DPRF.
        13.3.3.4. HQ ARPC/ DPRF will forward the completed AF IMT 1289 or completed AROWS-R
        request to HQ ARPC/FMF to have actual orders published.
        13.3.3.5. For unit members, HQ AFRC/A1XY will notify the member’s unit commander for
        coordination and have orders published for paid and permissive TDY.
     13.3.4. ADT tours will not be used in combination with other Reserve man-day programs to include
     MPA for the same event. In other words, Air Force Major Commands (MAJCOM), units, or agencies
     cannot circumvent manpower authorization levels through continuous man-day application, using a
     combination of ADT and ADSW (Reserve Personnel Appropriations (RPA) and MPA considered).
        13.3.4.1. For waiver process of MPA tours, see AFI 36-2619, Military Personnel Appropriation
        (MPA) Man-Day Program.
     13.3.5. Reservists on ADT for a period of time for which the training or requirement will overlap hol-
     idays or weekends, or includes mandated technical phase training, must be on continuous orders until
     completion of training or requirement. This does not negate the requirement for any necessary
     man-day waiver authority.
     13.3.6. Reserve Unit Resource Advisors/Program Managers will submit their FY ADT requirements
     to their budget office for funding.
        13.3.6.1. HQ AFRC staff offices having a need for ADT requirements will submit their FY bud-
        get to HQ AFRC/FMA for funding.

   13.4.3. Reserve quotas for schools conducted by Air Education and Training Command (AETC),
   other MAJCOMs, services, and government agencies are processed by HQ AFRC Formal School
   Branch and HQ ARPC/DPRPT.
      13.4.3.1. Individuals and units will NOT contact schools directly regarding availability of quotas,
      class dates, or other school information. Units must contact HQ AFRC/A1TF, and IMAs must
      contact their Program Manager for school information.
   13.4.4. HQ AFRC may also conduct selected courses from within their own resources, provided that
   validated and funded manpower authorizations are available to support these courses.

13.5. Scheduling ADT Tours:

      ing travel expenses to the IDT location.
      13.5.1.3. Commanders and supervisors should ensure that all ADT tours performed in conjunc-
      tion with IDT can be substantiated by a valid support or training requirement.
   13.5.2. Reservists attending schools that are closed during the holiday season will remain in school
   tour status during the closedown period.
      13.5.2.1. Students will take leave, or remain at school and perform duties as required by the train-
      ing organization. No travel orders for the purpose of taking leave will be issued.
      13.5.2.2. Authorization to return to home unit must be on the original order or an amendment
      must be accomplished. Letters to the technical school liaisons will not be accepted.
   13.5.3. Unit assigned students may request to return voluntarily to the Permanent Duty Station (PDS)
   to perform duty during the downtime, if the PDS commander agrees and certifies there is suitable
   work for the member to perform at the PDS.
      13.5.3.1. Under no circumstances are units to recall any student.
      13.5.3.2. A recall action terminates enrollment and precludes the student’s return after the holiday
      period. Commanders may not direct the student to return home.
   13.5.4. Students must coordinate their absence with the appropriate school officials and give them a
   copy of their orders. Students must not depart earlier than, nor return later than, time authorized by
   school officials for their respective courses.
50                                                                            AFRCI36-2203 7 JUNE 2006


        13.5.4.1. Students must be aware of the limitation on travel allowances which are dependent upon
        individual circumstances.
     13.5.5. Military members attending school under TDY entitlements are entitled to paid government
     travel based on a cost comparison of their per diem and travel/transportation expenses.
        13.5.5.1. Members will receive the lesser of actual travel time and transportation expenses for the
        travel time only (constructed as most economical to the government), or the per diem they would
        have received had they remained at school.
        13.5.5.2. It is possible, therefore, for members to be responsible for paying a portion of their
        travel expenses if it exceeds the per diem they would have earned during the close down.
     13.5.6. Military members attending school under Permanent Change of Station (PCS) entitlements
     receive no per diem. Therefore, there is no offset to cover any portion of their travel.
        13.5.6.1. Members must pay any travel costs to return to the PDS to perform duty. The benefit for
        members in this category is the ability to return to the PDS without being charged leave.
     13.5.7. For civilians (including Air Reserve Technicians (ART)), the same conditions apply as for
     military members under TDY entitlements.
     13.5.8. It is the student’s responsibility to seek clarification from the school travel pay office if unsure
     about his/her specific circumstances.

13.6. Travel: Table 5.1 in AFMAN 36-8001, Chapter 5, Table 5.1, contains travel restrictions. Program
managers should only approve ADT tours with travel when absolutely necessary.
     13.6.1. When on AD for 20 or more weeks (PCS), no per diem or Actual Expense Authority is pay-
     able at any location regardless of the availability of government quarters and government mess per
     JFTR. Exceptions may apply during periods of mobilization or Secretary approved waiver

13.7. Application Procedures for ADT (School Tours):
     13.7.1. HQ AFRC units will request formal training as follows:

          ber requires 60 days notice for employer).
          13.7.1.5.3. When members are substituted into allocated quotas, follow established proce-
          dures using current automated system as appropriate.
       13.7.1.6. IMAs requesting ADT (school) will submit a training request using current automated
       system or an AF IMT 1289 to the program manager.
          13.7.1.6.1. Program managers will ensure applicants meet course prerequisites and eligibility
          requirements to include retainability, appropriate level of security clearance, and physical
          exam requirements. The program manager will then forward tour request to HQ ARPC/
          DPRPT to arrive at least 45 days prior to the class start date.
       13.7.1.7. IMA Program Managers may ask for a waiver to the prerequisites for a course. Send the
       request for waiver to HQ AFRC/RMG. HQ AFRC/RMG obtains a waiver from the respective
       school.
          13.7.1.7.1. The orders must contain a statement of waiver approval. Do not request waivers
          for more than one prerequisite unless there is exceptional justification.
       13.7.1.8. The unit requests waivers of prerequisite from MPF/DPMT to HQ AFRC Formal
       School Branch. The Formal School Branch obtains a waiver from the respective school.
          13.7.1.8.1. The orders must contain a statement of waiver approval. Do not request waivers
          for more than one prerequisite unless there is exceptional justification.

13.8. Duration and Frequency of School Tours: The duration and frequency of school tours are as fol-
lows:
   13.8.1. Course length, travel time, and accrued leave determines the duration of the tour.
   13.8.2. The frequency of attending school courses will be consistent with the need to maintain job
   proficiency in an individual’s duty AFSC or with an approved retraining action. Other
52                                                                        AFRCI36-2203 7 JUNE 2006


     non-AFSC related courses of 5 days duration or more will be limited to one course per member within
     a period of 1 FY.
        13.8.2.1. Individuals selected by an approved school selection board to attend resident DE are
        exempt from this rule.
        13.8.2.2. A waiver to the FY limitation on course attendance may be granted if a school course is
        needed to keep or improve a member’s mobilization readiness.
     13.8.3. The member should request a waiver through the unit of assignment for unit members or the
     IMA Program Manager. It must be forwarded to HQ AFRC Formal School Branch or HQ AFRC/
     RMG for approval.

13.9. Requesting ADT (Nonschool) tours:
     13.9.1. For mobilization assistants (general officer and colonel), the limit on ADT and ADSW tours
     is 90 days per FY. Requests to exceed the 90-day limitation must be sent to HQ USAF/RESOMO.
     13.9.2. Only in unusual circumstances should any individual be directed to perform ADT before the
     issuance of a written order.
     13.9.3. Send a copy of all special tour ADT orders on HQ AFRC commanders in general officer posi-
     tions to HQ USAF/RESOMO.

13.10. School Tour Eligibility:
     13.10.1. A member takes part in a school tour to keep or increase proficiency in the duty AFSC or
     wartime tasking. For enlisted members, school tours are identified in the CFETP. This may include
     a school tour to retrain a member to meet mobilization needs. A school tour applicant must:
     13.10.2. Meet all prerequisites for the course.
     13.10.3. Meet the medical standards in AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards. Physical
     examinations for flying courses must be certified by HQ AFRC/A6 before requesting a school tour
     allocation.
     13.10.4. Meet Air Force physical fitness standards (AFI 10-248, Fitness Program). A statement
     addressing the member’s completion of fitness test, with specified date, must be included in the
     remarks section of the school order.
     13.10.5. Must out process through the appropriate sections within the Military Personnel Flight
     (MPF) before departing for school (regardless of tour length), unless geographically separated from
     the MPF. Members must sign a Reserve Service Commitment, if applicable.
     13.10.6. Reserve members must have at least 1 year retainability following graduation for all courses
     that are less than 15 days. Courses exceeding 15 days, retainability is 2 years following graduation.
     Retainability is governed by ETCA and AFRC guidelines. For DE, see AFI 36-2301, Professional
     Military Education.

13.11. Priorities for School Training:
     13.11.1. If formal training cannot be conducted due to limited funds, prioritizing training require-
     ments will be necessary. Because each unit’s needs are different, a listing of courses is not possible
AFRCI36-2203 7 JUNE 2006                                                                                 53


   for all to use. Each unit must compile its own list to determine the essential versus nonessential train-
   ing needs. The courses that do not award an AFSC and are not essential for mission requirements will
   receive lowest priority. The following guidance is furnished with the understanding that each unit
   must review its mission and establish priorities based on this review. Some areas to be considered in
   establishing these priorities are furnished for information.
      13.11.1.1. Initial skills courses (enlisted 3-level AFSC and officer AFSC awarding, enlisted/
      officer aircrew)
      13.11.1.2. AFSC sustainment courses (i.e. 5/7 level upgrade)
      13.11.1.3. Essential courses affecting unit C-status
      13.11.1.4. Developmental education.
   13.11.2. To help establish school request priorities, wing/group commanders should establish an
   informal school committee to review and prioritize known unit training requirements. Review this list
   frequently to realign requirements based on available school funds.
   13.11.3. School tour requests are not to be turned down or canceled for lack of unit funds until all
   efforts have been exhausted to obtain additional funding.
      13.11.3.1. For unit reservists, HQ AFRC/FMA has established procedures for requesting
      unfunded requirements.
      13.11.3.2. Only when HQ AFRC/FMA verifies funding is not available will training requests be
      denied.
   13.11.4. Prior to contacting HQ AFRC Formal School Branch for quota cancellation, these proce-
   dures must be initiated. Written documentation, signed by the budget officer and the wing com-
   mander, will be submitted to HQ AFRC Formal School Branch if a quota is canceled for lack of
   funding.
   13.11.5. A member’s unit of assignment is normally responsible to ensure orders are published at
   least 30 days before class start date. The ETCA should be used as guidance when initiating unit
   orders.

13.12. OJT/AFSC Training:
   13.12.1. Use OJT/AFSC training tours for reservists in their DAFSCs , not for award of the 3-skill
   level.
   13.12.2. The immediate supervisor initiates a written request for subject training, coordinating with
   unit training manager and unit commander/program manager. Use the following guidelines when
   considering an OJT/AFSC training tour:
      13.12.2.1. A trainer must be available to conduct training.
      13.12.2.2. If training cannot be accomplished at the duty section or unit of assignment, a host unit
      or duty section may, upon mutual agreement, provide the required training.
      13.12.2.3. Establish a training plan for the trainee.
      13.12.2.4. The immediate supervisor ensures unit funds are available to support the tour and that
      training accomplishments are recorded in an authorized automated system or OJT record.
54                                                                      AFRCI36-2203 7 JUNE 2006


        13.12.2.5. Tours for OJT will be restricted to upgrade/skill-level requirements. Unit command-
        ers/program managers will periodically (suggested every 60 days) review the Career Field Educa-
        tion Training Plan to determine if member is progressing and will be authorized to continue
        upgrade training.

13.13. Programming Command Requirements for School Tours:
     13.13.1. IMA school tour requirements are compiled by HQ ARPC/DPRPT.
        13.13.1.1. When requested, program managers will consolidate their school training requirements
        and forward to HQ AFRC/RMG.
        13.13.1.2. HQ ARPC/DPRPT consolidates all IMA school requirements for the subsequent FYs
        and inputs through automated training system.
     13.13.2. Unit formal school requirements will be identified annually by unit/wing/NAF/Recruiting
     Squadron using the web-based formal schools forecast tool.
     13.13.3. Each functional manager will have final approval of all requirements for the AFSCs they
     manage and confirms or adjusts the school requirements for their courses.
     13.13.4. HQ AFRC Formal School Branch will ensure that all requirements are input into the auto-
     mated system.
     13.13.5. Command functional managers will submit any out-of-cycle requirements changes to For-
     mal School Branch by letter. This letter must contain the course ID number, title, fiscal year con-
     cerned, and what action is required.
     13.13.6. School tours directly supporting a unit activation or conversion may precede the pro-
     grammed activation or conversion date by 6 months.

13.14. Action Taken After Receiving School Program Approval:
     13.14.1. HQ AFRC Formal School Branch obtains and allocates the formal school quotas for all
     members assigned to the Command with the exception of IMAs.
        13.14.1.1. Course reporting instructions can be found in the ETCA.
        13.14.1.2. The proper TCC must be evident on the school tour order.
     13.14.2. HQ ARPC/DPRPT obtains and allocates IMA quotas. Orders will be published through
     AROWS-R by the member. HQ ARPC/DPRPT provides reporting and administrative instructions.
     Requests for school tour orders must be submitted at least 45 days before the class start date.

13.15. Procedures for Filling, Deleting, or Changing Quota Requirements:
     13.15.1. Follow established procedures for cancellations, substitutions, and changes and submit to
     AFRC and AFRC RMG NLT 30 days prior to class start date to allow for reallocation or return to
     quota source.
     13.15.2. Provide documentation for no-shows and short-notice cancellations (quotas cancelled within
     10 days of class start date).
        13.15.2.1. Wing DPMT (unit) or program managers (IMA) will submit written justification (unit
        no-shows and/or cancellation justification must be signed by appropriate unit/wing commander)
AFRCI36-2203 7 JUNE 2006                                                                                 55


      and forward it to AFRC (unit) or HQ AFRC/RMG. (Also applicable to ARTs with civilian quotas
      assigned.)

13.16. Submitting Unprogrammed Quota Requests during Execution Year:
   13.16.1. IMA program managers should submit unprogrammed quota requests with supporting justi-
   fication (automated orders system request) to HQ AFRC/RMG no later than 45 days before class start
   date.
   13.16.2. Units submit unprogrammed quota requests through respective wing training offices for sub-
   mission through automated system at least 45 days prior to class start date.

13.17. Action Taken on School Completion:
   13.17.1. A Statement of Tour of Duty, AF IMT 938, Request and Authorization for Active Duty
   Training/Active Tour (computer-generated or hard copy), must be signed by the member, certified by
   the member supervising training, and sent to the member’s designated Reserve Pay Office (RPO)
   within 5 workdays after the tour is completed.
   13.17.2. For the IMA, the Statement of Tour of Duty may be precertified and submitted to the desig-
   nated RPO anytime after the official tour start date.

13.18. Procedures for Catastrophic or other Events:
   13.18.1. NPS. Respective training squadrons will maintain training integrity, to include continuation
   of member’s orders. Generally speaking, there will be no interruption in pipeline training. However,
   should an interruption occur, pipeline members will remain on IADT orders to complete the required
   84 days of training.
   13.18.2. HQ AFRC Formal School Branch will work with wing training and HQ AETC or respective
   course owner to ensure member’s re-entry into formal course of instruction.
   13.18.3. PS. Generally, prior service personnel will be returned to their home unit with sufficient
   time to transition through the MPF and will then be removed from orders.
      13.18.3.1. HQ AFRC Formal School Branch, in concert with AETC or respective course owner,
      will provide timely instruction and updates to wing training offices on formal disposition of mem-
      bers, to include identification of processes for re-entry into formal course.

13.19. Contracted Civilian Acquired Training (CCAT):
   13.19.1. CCAT is designed to increase the number of mission-qualified individuals in the Reserve
   Component. It is an alternative to proficiency training and must be directly related to specific individ-
   ual mobilization skill requirements.
      13.19.1.1. CCAT applies to both AFSC awarding training and sustainment training.
      13.19.1.2. CCAT is an option for a formal school request.
   13.19.2. Contract training is authorized when it is demonstrated that such training fulfills all military
   requirements, is less costly, and military service school quotas have been requested, but are not avail-
   able to satisfy an identified training requirement specified by the military service concerned.
56                                                                          AFRCI36-2203 7 JUNE 2006


     13.19.3. Only fully accredited civilian institutions and industries may be used for CCAT. Observe all
     existing laws and regulations on contracting from non-DoD sources.
     13.19.4. HQ AFRC Functional Managers will initiate requests to establish CCAT, when warranted.
     As a minimum, the functional manager should define the size and type of the population to be trained,
     the skills to be obtained, and the proposed source of the training.
        13.19.4.1. HQ AFRC/A1T will validate Reserve requests. Only HQ AFRC contracting officers
        are authorized to negotiate contracts for approved CCAT.
        13.19.4.2. For IMAs, the program manager will work through RMG and ARPC to AFRC Func-
        tional Managers to initiate a requirement.
     13.19.5. Command functional managers will maintain records reflecting cost per student hour, name
     of institution, and number of students trained per fiscal year for each of their CCAT programs.
     13.19.6. Special Restrictions on Utilization of RPA Special Tours in Conjunction With Commercial
     or Contract Activities. When on-the-job training (OJT) or proficiency training is available only
     through participation with a commercial, contract activity:
        13.19.6.1. Conduct the training under the supervision of a qualified trainer designated by the
        applicable performance work statement.
        13.19.6.2. The appropriate military organization responsible for the functional area supported by
        the performance work statement requests special tours.

13.20. ART Attendance to Schools:
     13.20.1. General Guidance.
        13.20.1.1. Each ART position is identified with a Reserve position which is identical, or so
        closely related as to require substantially the same basic knowledge and skills in either position.
        Accordingly, ARTs will attend schools and training courses in civilian status, except as otherwise
        noted.
        13.20.1.2. When attending training courses in civilian status, the appropriate civilian attire for the
        course of instruction will be worn. However, members are encouraged to wear the military uni-
        form.
        13.20.1.3. Some courses may require the wearing of special equipment and, regardless of status,
        all attendees will abide by these requirements, to include physical fitness requirements.
        13.20.1.4. ARTs traveling in a civilian capacity will include both the military and civilian grade
        on their orders. ARTs will be housed according to the military grade.
        13.20.1.5. A statement addressing the member’s compliance with physical fitness testing, with
        specified date, must be included in the remarks section of the school order.
        13.20.1.6. HQ AFRC functional managers will identify those courses requiring mandatory atten-
        dance in military status. Specific courses will be identified on the A1T web site.
        13.20.1.7. Individuals requesting attendance in civilian status will complete DD Form 1556, and
        according to local procedures, will forward through the wing training office, if applicable, to the
        appropriate servicing civilian training office for processing.
AFRCI36-2203 7 JUNE 2006                                                                                 57


     13.20.1.8. Only requests coordinated through the servicing office will be accepted by AFRC For-
     mal School Branch.
     13.20.1.9. The individual status will be determined prior to submission of the training request.
     13.20.1.10. Formal schools are those listed in ETCA. The majority of these schools are processed
     through the automated training system and a Training Line Number (TLN) is generated.
     13.20.1.11. The servicing civilian training office is responsible for reviewing and approving all
     requests for training according to regulatory, statutory, and legal requirements.
     13.20.1.12. AF IMT 101 will not be used to request courses in civilian status.
     13.20.1.13. ARTs will not use a civilian training quota/training line number to attend in military
     status or use a military quota to attend in civilian status.
     13.20.1.14. Individuals will not submit duplicate requests through military channels requesting
     the same course/class. The individual status will be determined prior to submission of the training
     request.
     13.20.1.15. Members cannot use annual training to satisfy formal school training requirements.
     13.20.1.16. Members attending courses in civilian status will begin and remain in that status dur-
     ing the duration of the training. Switching status is not authorized (i.e., civilian status 1 week/mil-
     itary status the next/back to civilian status).
     13.20.1.17. ARTs, regardless of status (military or civilian), will NOT continue to meet flying
     operations requirements while they are attending resident formal training, including members
     attending courses collocated with unit of assignment. This restriction will allow the member to
     remain focused on the academic rigors of the institution they are attending.
  13.20.2. Each FY, HQ AFRC is given a number of funded quotas (bogeys). AETC fund cites are
  used for travel/per diem. There is no tuition cost for formal schools. However, the number of bogeys
  available each year does not remain constant.
     13.20.2.1. Bogeys are not used for flying, AFIT, Air University (AU), medical, survival, or com-
     mand specific (AMC, ACC, ANG, etc.) training courses.
     13.20.2.2. When funded quotas are available for use, ARTs will attend formal schools in civilian
     status.
         13.20.2.2.1. When bogeys are not available for use, the wing commanders can approve the
         exceptions to attend in military status. For NAF Commanders, this authority may be delegated
         to the RSG/CC for ARTs assigned at NAF level. The 951 RSPTS/CC will approve all
         requests for ARTs assigned to HQ AFRC.
         13.20.2.2.2. ARTs attending school in civilian status will abide by all appropriate guidelines/
         rules established by the school and required of all students.
         13.20.2.2.3. AFIT normally funds the travel/per diem for civilian students, therefore, ARTs
         will also be required to attend courses in civilian status.
         13.20.2.2.4. Short notice cancellations (those turned in within 10 days or less) and no-shows
         will be documented in writing, signed by the wing commander, and forwarded through the
         wing training office to HQ AFRC Formal School Branch.

     13.20.3. Funding Guidance:
        13.20.3.1. When ARTs attend school in civilian status, O&M funds are utilized. If military status
        school tour, 726 funds are used. Note that there are no tuition costs associated with formal
        schools, only travel/per diem.
        13.20.3.2. For DE, the funding is centrally managed by HQ AFRC. Unit O&M funds will be used
        if attending in civilian status.
     13.20.4. Documentation of Training in Personnel Records:
        13.20.4.1. Upon completion of a training course attended in civilian status (and with an appropri-
        ate civilian TLN), the member’s training records will be appropriately updated through the civil-
        ian personnel data system. However, because the military and civilian personnel systems do not
        interact, it is up to the individual to provide documentation to the servicing military personnel
        flight at base training office, to update military records.
        13.20.4.2. In some instances (i.e., officer DE) the member may need to provide the source docu-
        ment to the school registrar for update of records.
     13.20.5. Tuition Assistance:
        13.20.5.1. As a civilian employee, tuition assistance may be available under the local tuition
        assistance policy at each respective base. Local O&M (unit) funds are used. Where a unit is a ten-
        ant at an AD base, the funding remains a unit responsibility.
        13.20.5.2. For those ARTs registered in an Air Force civilian career program (other than the ART
        Officer Career Program), it may be possible to obtain tuition assistance through that means.

                                       MAINTENANCE TRAINING

17.1. Scope:
     17.1.1. Maintenance Training (MT) ensures initial, recurring and advanced proficiency, or personnel
     acquire certification skills to perform duties in their primary AFSC. They also assist supervisors with
     upgrade, qualification, and MT programs. The overall capability of a unit depends on the state of
     training for maintenance personnel. Training is essential to improving and sustaining unit capability
     and is one of the most important responsibilities of commanders and supervisors. Providing training
     in combat and sortie generation skills not normally integrated into peacetime operations (e.g., external
     fuel tank build-up, hot refueling, etc.) is particularly critical and requires special management atten-
     tion.
     17.1.2. Commanders and supervisors must give priority support to training. When balancing
     resources, (e.g., aircraft, support equipment, facilities, tools, funding, personnel, etc.), MT carries an
     equal priority with the operational training mission. MT is established according to AFI 36-2201,
     Developing, Managing, and Conducting Training, and applicable MAJCOM training directives.

17.2. Maintenance Training will:
     17.2.1. Administer and implement the maintenance training program and policy for the squadron or
     group as applicable.
     17.2.2. Serve as the single point of contact and liaison for the wing training office for all training mat-
     ters affecting maintenance, including outside agencies such as disaster preparedness and the Field
     Training Detachments (FTDs).
     17.2.3. Be familiar with Air Force Engineering and Technical Services (AFETS)/Contractor Engi-
     neering and Technical Services (CETS) programs as listed in AFI 21-110, Engineering and Technical
     Services Management and Control.
     17.2.4. Provide monthly metrics to the group/squadron commanders and NAF/LGMA.
     17.2.5. Coordinate requests for formal training, FTDs, and other gaining MAJCOM courses.
     17.2.6. Publish a monthly training schedule that will not adversely affect the maintenance production
     effort, but will ensure the availability of personnel, facilities, and training devices to accomplish train-
     ing requirements.
     17.2.7. Coordinate to ensure necessary supplies, tools, equipment, classrooms, and personnel are
     available for scheduled classes.
     17.2.8. Coordinate training no-shows, overdues, and deviation letters through the appropriate work
     center, to maintenance supervision and squadron/group commanders.
     17.2.9. Control, maintain, and secure maintenance tests.
     17.2.10. Manage the Maintenance Information System (MIS) training subsystem.
     17.2.11. Ensure Special Certification Roster (SCR) information is loaded in the MIS.
     17.2.12. Ensure a newcomer’s orientation program is developed and conducted.
AFRCI36-2203 7 JUNE 2006                                                                               75


   17.2.13. Ensure an ancillary training program is established.
   17.2.14. Develop a local training operating instruction.
   17.2.15. Serves as the Maintenance Training POC for all Site Activation Task Force (SATAF), unit
   conversion, and major equipment modifications.
   17.2.16. Assist work center supervisors in preparing training classes and course outlines/lesson plans.
   17.2.17. Coordinate in the selection of unit maintenance instructors.
   17.2.18. Ensure Subject Matter Experts (SME) review lesson plans every 24 months.
   17.2.19. Conduct in-/out-processing of personnel.
   17.2.20. Coordinate Maintenance Officer Orientation Training (MOOT) Program.
   17.2.21. Disseminate Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW) information to work center super-
   visors and submit SME nominations in support of U&TWs to the NAF.
   17.2.22. Establish procedures for controlling and maintaining a multimedia library.

17.3. Processing Personnel:
   17.3.1. In-processing. Ensure Programs and Resources and/or MT as determined locally assigns the
   employee number in the MIS.
      17.3.1.1. Additional items to be considered during in-processing are:
      17.3.1.2. Formal school requirements, CDC requirements, maintenance orientation briefings, and
      supervisor’s initial evaluation.
      17.3.1.3. The MT will ensure a change of address for CDCs is updated within 30 days of assign-
      ment to unit.
   17.3.2. Out-processing. MT reviews the individual’s training record and gives all related training
   products to the individual, to include an MIS generated printout.
      17.3.2.1. If member is transferring to a new base and is enrolled in a CDC, ensure member has all
      course materials.
      17.3.2.2. Brief the member about the importance of changing the TCF number with the AFIADL
      when in-processing at their gaining unit.
      17.3.2.3. If a CE is on base, contact the Base Education and Training Manager to transfer the CE
      to the gaining unit. Programs and Resources and/or MT as determined locally are responsible for
      deleting the employee number in the MIS when notified by the MPF.

17.4. Newcomers' Orientation:
   17.4.1. Ensure a newcomers' orientation program is developed and conducted, familiarizing newly
   assigned personnel with maintenance activities. You may automate the orientation.
   17.4.2. The MXG/CC determines which organization will conduct the newcomers' orientation. Top-
   ics should include unit mission, tasking plans, supply procedures, foreign object damage (FOD) pro-
   gram, general flight line and work center safety rules, Quality Assurance Program (QAP) and product
   improvement procedures.
76                                                                         AFRCI36-2203 7 JUNE 2006


     17.4.3. MT will track newcomers' orientation completion in the MIS to ensure newcomers receive the
     training within 120 days of arrival.

17.5. Deployment Requirements:
     17.5.1. Personnel who deploy will take their AF Form 623 and MIS printout. The Deployment Team
     Chief is responsible to carry a signed SCR and ensure it is on hand at the deployed location.
     17.5.2. Supervisors must verify adequate personnel are qualified on all necessary vehicles, e.g., fork-
     lifts, tow vehicles, etc.
     17.5.3. Commanders will ensure personnel selected to deploy have all required ancillary/mobility
     training, e.g., small arms marksmanship training, chemical warfare training, suicide prevention, etc.
     and any additional training requirements completed prior to the deployment.

17.6. Maintaining Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP):
     17.6.1. AFRC personnel (i.e., ART, AGR, TR) accomplishing and performing aircraft maintenance
     and related duties will have their training documented in the AF Form 623 according to AFI 36-2201
     and local directives.
     17.6.2. Non-ART civilian personnel performing hands-on maintenance will have documented train-
     ing using either the appropriate CFETP or an equivalent method of documentation meeting the same
     standards. If using the CFETP for documenting civilian training, it may also be used to support the ini-
     tial evaluation process, but will not be solely used to justify a military skill level upgrade action.
        17.6.2.1. The CFETP will not replace the Position Description or the Performance Plan, nor will
        you use it as a civilian evaluation tool of any kind.
     17.6.3. Training records are mandatory for all personnel in the military grade of Technical Sergeant
     (E-6) and below as well as any other personnel in upgrade training or retraining.
     17.6.4. A current training record will be maintained on all Master Sergeants (E-7s) and above who
     perform maintenance on aircraft or associated equipment. Give consideration for tasks individuals
     may be called upon to perform while deployed.
        17.6.4.1. MSgts and above need only be qualified on assigned tasks that they perform. This does
        not necessarily include career field core tasks or local upgrade requirements unless they will be
        performing these tasks.
        17.6.4.2. Annotate individual’s duty task qualifications on a CFETP or AF IMT 797, Job Qualifi-
        cation Standard Continuation/Command JQS and the MIS, as required.

17.7. Cross-Utilization Training (CUT):
     17.7.1. CUT training provides the unit’s internal flexibility by training individuals to perform tasks
     that are not in their primary AFSC. This training can offset periods of austere or low skill level man-
     ning. It also enhances combat capability by developing a pool of qualified personnel to draw upon
     during surges.
     17.7.2. Use care not to create a dependency upon CUT trained personnel for every task. CUT will
     never be a long-term fix or management solution for an AFSC shortfall. Ensure CUT does not inter-
AFRCI36-2203 7 JUNE 2006                                                                              77


   fere with upgrade training or qualification training of individuals not qualified on the assigned
   weapon system.
   17.7.3. Commanders, flightline supervisors, and training managers must ensure personnel selected
   for CUT are performing satisfactorily in their assigned AFSC and meet CUT prerequisites to maintain
   a balanced work force.
   17.7.4. The CUT target group includes personnel trained to the 5-skill level or higher. Personnel with
   a 3-skill level will not participate in CUT. (EXCEPTION: Individuals who have satisfied all 5-skill
   level upgrade training requirements in their primary AFSC and have completed 15 months on-the-job
   training (OJT) may be CUT trained). The MXG/CC identifies required CUT tasks for each AFSC,
   ensuring tasks are trained via formalized OJT.
   17.7.5. Ensure that CUT training is properly documented on an AF IMT 797 according to AFI
   36-2201 and/or the MIS. Annotate “CUT TRAINING” across the bottom of the AF IMT 797.
   17.7.6. Personnel retraining from another Mission Design Series (MDS) will have at least 6 months
   experience on their current MDS prior to being CUT.
   17.7.7. Personnel not possessing a primary aircraft maintenance AFSC (2A6X2, 2G0X1, 2R0X1,
   2R1X1, 2S0X1, 3S0X1, 3S2X1) will not be trained or perform aircraft maintenance duties. EXCEP-
   TIONS: Units with an external tank build-up tasking may train and utilize personnel not possessing
   aircraft maintenance AFSCs and other duties as authorized in AFI 21-101, Aerospace Equipment
   Maintenance Management.

17.8. AFRC Retraining Policy:
   17.8.1. AFRC maintenance retraining policy is applicable on an individual basis to members who are
   retraining. You may award personnel the 3-skill level AFSC without submitting a formal school
   waiver provided you comply with the requirements listed below. This applies to members retraining
   into the 2A3X3X, 2A5X1X, 2A5X2, and 2A6X1X career fields.
NOTE: This does not apply to units that are converting to another MDS. They will follow guidance as
determined by the conversion process in paragraph 17.9. and SATAF.
   17.8.2. Retrainees must have a 5-skill level and 4 years experience in a previous maintenance AFSC.
   Upon initial classification, award member a 1-skill level and place in TSC E.
   17.8.3. For award of the 3-skill level, member must complete the appropriate FTD course in the
   retraining AFSC. You cannot waive these FTDs. If there are multiple FTD courses listed for a spe-
   cific aircraft, the supervisor, with MXG/CC approval, determines the appropriate FTD course(s)
   requirements based on the members previous experience and current qualifications. EXCEPTION:
   AFSC 2A6X1A retraining to 2A6X1B for C-130 is required to attend two FTD courses.
NOTE: If member is already at the 5-skill level and the AFSC shred is the same, do not drop member to
the 1-skill level. Member must attend the appropriate FTD. Training manager must ensure member is
placed in qualification training in MIS.
   17.8.4. For required FTDs for retraining see Attachment 21. Chart is also located on line with any
   updates at AFRC/A1TS-Training Support Branch website.
78                                                                         AFRCI36-2203 7 JUNE 2006


17.9. Unit Mission Design Series Conversion Process:
     17.9.1. AFRC retraining policy does not apply to conversion training for maintenance personnel.
     17.9.2. Training managers should begin preparing for a conversion by reviewing AFRCI 10-501,
     Development of Programming Plans and Programming Messages. FTD and Field Training Team
     (FTT) courses taken will be dependent on what type of aircraft the unit will be converting to. Con-
     verting units will maximize use of all training quotas for transition courses offered during the conver-
     sion window. Once the conversion window has closed, the MXG/CC determines how to train
     personnel not completing transition courses. Maintenance personnel must complete required tasks
     identified in their CFETP.
     17.9.3. During conversions, a SATAF may be conducted. Regardless, the MT may be required to
     coordinate the following issues: initial cadre, FTD, determine FTT requirements by AFSC, requests
     for dedicated training aircraft, classroom facilities/audiovisual equipment, transportation/lodging for
     instructors, and follow-on training.

17.10. Unit Training Assembly (UTA) Scheduling:
     17.10.1. Prior to the UTA, publish a training schedule with sufficient time for supervisors to notify
     personnel and integrate scheduled training into UTA work schedules
        17.10.1.1. The training schedule should be published at least 1 week prior to the UTA. Publish
        training schedules at least monthly.
        17.10.1.2. You may automate the schedules and post them to shared drives.
        17.10.1.3. Supervisors will post training schedule in the work center.
     17.10.2. Developing UTA training schedule. Contact base agencies/training providers to obtain time,
     day, duration, and quotas. Coordinate in-house training with supervisors for inclusion into schedule.
     Other suggested items: listing of personnel eligible to test, Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR),
     ancillary requirements, etc.
     17.10.3. Ensure facilities and equipment are available for use. Examples of other items to consider
     are classroom space, CPR mannequins, audiovisual media, and support equipment.
     17.10.4. MT coordinates with base agencies for annual forecasting of seat/quota availability for plan-
     ning purposes. This is important to ensure ample training opportunities exist for the unit’s training
     requirements.

17.11. MultiMedia Library:
     17.11.1. Manage multimedia programs and associated equipment and maintain an inventory listing of
     programs on hand. It will include, but is not limited to videos, interactive courseware, and CBT.
     17.11.2. The following are a few of the support organizations for sources of audiovisual media: 367/
     TRSS, 6058 Aspen Ave, Hill AFB UT 84056-5805, HQ AMWC/WCOL, 5656 Texas Ave, Ft Dix NJ
     08640-7400, Joint Visual Information Activity, http://DoDimagery.afis.osd.mil, 11 Hap Arnold
     Blvd, Tobyhanna PA 18466-5102.

17.12. Testing:
   17.12.1. All locally devised tests should be confined to the directives in the individual’s specific area.
   Tests should also be constructed to measure what an individual is normally expected to retain for per-
   formance of duties.
   17.12.2. Guidance for developing and administering a test program is explained further in AFMAN
   36-2234, Instructional System Development and AFMAN 36-2236, Guidebook for Air Force Instruc-
   tors.
   17.12.3. Supervisors may request MT to assist in developing tests. NOTE: The respective OPRs
   develop and maintain tests associated with weapons load training.
   17.12.4. Types of Tests. When developing tests, selected items should be clear and concise. Follow-
   ing are types of tests used:
       17.12.4.1. Written tests. You may administer written tests using automated testing programs.
          17.12.4.1.1. Multiple choice
          17.12.4.1.2. Fill in the blanks
          17.12.4.1.3. Short essay
          17.12.4.1.4. True/False
          17.12.4.1.5. Matching
       17.12.4.2. Performance test
   17.12.5. Develop a primary and alternate test for each course that requires a written test. Only 25 per-
   cent of the questions in the alternate test may duplicate questions from the primary test.
       17.12.5.1. Units that use an automated testing program with a test bank that randomly selects test
       questions are not required to have a primary and alternate test. However, the test bank will contain
       a minimum of 75 percent or more questions than required for each individual test. For example, a
       test consisting of 20 questions would require the test bank to have a minimum of 35 questions
       loaded.
   17.12.6. Management of Unclassified Testing Materials. Control test materials at all times to prevent
   compromise. Unit procedures are as follows:
       17.12.6.1. All testing materials, to include computer disk(s), will be stored in a locked cabinet and
       identified on the master test control log.
       17.12.6.2. Use the master test control log to inventory tests quarterly.
       17.12.6.3. Control tests through a sign-out and sign-in log.
       17.12.6.4. An SME will review test materials annually or when changes to course objective war-
       rant a review.
   17.12.7. Mandatory Maintenance Tests
       17.12.7.1. Engine Run
       17.12.7.2. Aircraft Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), GTC, or APP (Engine run test and APU test
       procedures are found in AFI 21-101 and AFI 21-101 AFRC Supplement 1)
80                                                                         AFRCI36-2203 7 JUNE 2006


        17.12.7.3. Aircraft towing (AFI 11-218)
        17.12.7.4. Aircraft marshalling (AFI 11-218)
NOTE: The test list above is not all-inclusive and units may develop additional tests to support the main-
tenance activity.
     17.12.8. Test Failure:
        17.12.8.1. First time failures. Individuals must wait 24 hours before taking alternate test.
        17.12.8.2. Second time failures. SQ/CC (or equivalent) must authorize personnel to retest and
        continue in the program.
        17.12.8.3. Engine Run - APU Two Time Failure. After a second failure of either test, decertify
        the individual. The SQ/CC (or equivalent) must authorize personnel to re-enter the program.
        Before recertifying, individuals must attend all three phases of initial training.
NOTE: Air Mobility Command (AMC) gained units receive a test bank from Prime Maintenance Train-
ing Flights (MTF).

      17.13.1.8. Status of significant training problems and recommended corrective actions
   17.13.2. NAFs will combine units’ metrics data and forward a quarterly report to
   HQ AFRC/A4QMT not later than the 15th day after each quarter.

17.14. Maintenance Training Operating Instruction (OI):
   17.14.1. MT will develop and publish an operating instruction to specify local policies and proce-
   dures to include, as a minimum, training deviations, walk-ins, no-show policy, frequency and distribu-
   tion of automated training products, procedures for requesting training, CDC procedures, ancillary
   training, and formal schools.

17.15. Lesson Plans:
   17.15.1. To ensure standardized knowledge and performance task training, use lesson plans. A lesson
   plan provides information in the proper sequence, shows the relationship of one subject to another,
   and identifies all tools, equipment, and references necessary for teaching, while presenting the mate-
   rial in the same way to all students.
   17.15.2. Lesson plans are required when directed by AFI, MAJCOM, and/or the MXG/CC. Lesson
   plans are not required when Technical Orders (TOs), Job Guides, Commercial Off-The–Shelf (COTS)
   Manuals, and/or Inspection Work Cards serve as the primary instructional materials when conducting
   training or maintenance on operational aircraft systems and equipment. Lesson plans are not required
   when there is an approved Air Force or MAJCOM developed training program.
   17.15.3. When it has been determined a lesson plan is required, MT will assist the SME in developing
   the format and content of the lesson plan utilizing Instructional Systems Development (ISD) princi-
   ples. The SME will review their lesson plans every 24 months. NOTE: SME coordinates training
   Course Control Documents (CCD) dealing with explosive safety annually through the wing weapons
   safety office.

17.16. Maintenance Information Systems (MIS):
     17.16.1. MT utilizes two AF approved MIS systems for training documentation purposes: Integrated
     Maintenance Data System (IMDS) and GO81. All items maintained in the MIS and listed on the
     applicable CFETPs require first-time documentation in the CFETP. You will track tasks that are
     recurring or require special authorization.
        17.16.1.1. Ensure all work center training requirements have been loaded in the MIS. Update
        training entries into MIS in a timely manner (e.g., load, change, or delete course codes). When
        updating the MIS, an AF IMT 2426 or other appropriate source document is required.
        17.16.1.2. The work center supervisor will annotate training was completed and sign the source
        document before MIS update. AF IMT 2426, MAJCOM forms, and e-mails are acceptable source
        documents for this purpose. NOTE: Do not use e-mails for Special Certification items.
        17.16.1.3. MT must ensure there is reasonable security in place to avoid erroneous updates in the
        MIS. If delegating capability for MIS updates to work centers, the MXG/CC must approve autho-
        rized access in writing to ensure integrity. The authorization letter needs to be on file in the MT
        office.
        17.16.1.4. Individual recurring qualifications become overdue on the last day of the month in
        which recertification is due.
            17.16.1.4.1. When an individual is TDY, on leave, or incapacitated, that person need not be
            decertified provided the required evaluations are completed within 30 days of the member’s
            return to duty, not to exceed 2 calendar months from original due date.
            17.16.1.4.2. All 2W1XX Load Crew personnel will comply with provisions as outlined in AFI
            21-101, Chapter 17.

     to HQ AMC for fleetwide management of several weapon systems. It runs on a centrally located
     mainframe at Hill AFB, UT. The GO81 system is managed by the unit’s Automated Maintenance
     Analysis section that is subordinate to AMC/A44QA and HQ AFRC/LGQRI. Within GO81 is a
     training subsystem that is managed by HQ AMC/A44MT, Aircraft Maintenance Training Flight.
84                                                                     AFRCI36-2203 7 JUNE 2006


     17.16.3.2. Duplication between the manual and automated methods of documentation should be
     avoided. The primary focus of the automated MIS is to document completed courses, recurring
     training items, special certifications, inspector authorizations, enlisted specialty upgrade, and
     qualification training, if desired, and MAJCOM directed items. AMC gained AFRC units will uti-
     lize this system.
     17.16.3.3. Shop Level Utilization: Supervisors should maximize the capability of this system.
     Training conducted at the shop level should be updated in the MIS. This reduces paperwork on
     their part and results in real-time status in the MIS.
        17.16.3.3.1. Supervisors should contact their training manager to determine and obtain proper
        access level.
     17.16.3.4. General Information: Availability of a course code in the F9118 training course code
     table does not establish that all units must use it.
        17.16.3.4.1. Each unit has varying requirements and needs. Each unit determines which
        course codes they will utilize based on need and local management policies.
        17.16.3.4.2. Bases will not use course codes with another base prefix. If a base needs a course
        code that already exists at another base, they should request a new course code for com-
        mand-wide use.
        17.16.3.4.3. To request a course code add, change, or delete in GO81, complete the GO81
        Training Subsystem Course Code Request Worksheet (Attachment 24) and submit to your
        NAF.
     17.16.3.5. HQ AMC/A44MT has developed a GO81 Training Subsystem Users Guide which
     contains instructions for the programs utilized by training managers.
        17.16.3.5.1. These guides are located at the AMC/A4 website.
        17.16.3.5.2. The different programs that you will use in GO81 are as follows: F9051 – Pro-
        gram Instructions (On-line Help), F9118 – Training Course Code Inquiry/Update, F9119 –
        Personnel Training Record or Work Center Training Requirements, F9032T – Batch Training
        Reports, F9058 – Batch Job Execution (Reports), F9046 – Personnel Leave/Dispatch.
     17.16.3.6. Below are brief descriptions of programs you will use and examples of some of the dif-
     ferent actions associated with the programs. Refer to the users guide for detailed guidance.

Terms
Air Force Specialty (AFS)—A group of positions requiring common qualifications. Each AFS has a
title and a code.
Air Force Job Qualification Standard (AFJQS)—A comprehensive task list common to all persons
serving in the duty position which describes a particular job type or duty position.
Air Reserve Component (ARC)—When AFRC and the Air National Guard are used in a combined
status, together they are known as the Air Reserve Component.
Ancillary Training—Programs or courses that contribute to mission accomplishment, but are separate
from the requirements in an individual's primary AF specialty (AFS) or occupational series. Ancillary
training ensures that AF personnel receive an adequate blend of both general and technical knowledge and
capabilities. ATPs fall into three categories: (1) functional and additional duty, (2) general, and (3)
awareness.
Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP)—A comprehensive core training document that
identifies: (1) life-cycle education and training requirements, (2) training support resources, and (3)
minimum core task requirements for a specialty. The CFETP aims to give personnel a clear career path
and instill a sense of industry in career field training.
Certification—A formal indication of an individual's ability to perform a task to required standards.
Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM) Codes—Codes to identify all chief master sergeant positions in the
Enlisted Classification Structure. They also identify chief master sergeants that, through extensive
experience and training, have demonstrated managerial ability to plan, direct, coordinate, implement, and
control a wide range of work activity.
Core Task—Tasks that AFCFMs identify as minimum qualification requirements within an AFSC.
These are the minimum tasks necessary for certification for an individual to be upgraded.
Cross-Utilization Training (CUT)—Training designed to qualify personnel to perform tasks that are not
established requirements in their awarded AFSC. Examples may be found in AMCI 21-104 and ACCI
36-2251.
Field Training—Technical, operator, and other training that either an FTD or field training team
conducts at operational locations on specific systems and associated direct-support equipment for
maintenance.
Field Training Team (FTT)—A team of FTD instructors who conduct on-site training for a specified
and limited period of time. FTTs commonly support: (1) unit activations and conversions, and (2)
SATAFs.
Foreign Language Proficiency Pay (FLPP)—FLPP is a monthly monetary incentive paid to eligible
and qualified military and civilian personnel possessing foreign language proficiency. The objective of
FLPP is to encourage the acquisition, maintenance, and enhancement of foreign language skills vital to
national defense. The ability of the Air Force to interact in the international arena and respond effectively

to any global contingency mandates the need for qualified personnel to communicate with our allies and
the local populations as well as with our adversaries.
Go/No-Go—In OJT, the stage at which an individual has gained enough skill, knowledge, and experience
to perform the tasks without supervision. The individual meets local requirements for accuracy and time.
Kicker—The MGIB-SR Kicker is a supplemental educational assistance benefit of up to $350 for each
month that the Military Services may offer to encourage MGIB-SR eligible service members to fill
critical specialties, skills, or units.
Master Task Listing (MTL)—Document maintained within the work center that identifies all tasks
performed in the work center. This includes core, critical, and wartime tasks. This document can be
automated.
Master Training Plan (MTP)—A comprehensive plan for the work center covering 100 percent of work
center tasks. It includes the MTL, QTPs, AFJQS, CFETP, Milestones (time frames or dates) and any
other document that guides the training process to include CDC progression.
Readiness Management Group (RMG)—The Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) Readiness
Enhancement Plan was approved by AFRC/CC in Dec 2003. Under this plan, IMA Administrative
Control (ADCON) clearly flows from AFRC/CC through RMG/CC to the Program Manager. IMA
Operational Control (OPCON) remains unchanged.
Task—A unit of work activity or operation that forms a significant part of a duty. A task usually has clear
beginning and ending points and directly observable or otherwise measurable processes, frequently but
not always resulting in a product that can be evaluated for quantity, quality, accuracy, or fitness in the
work environment. A task is performed for its own sake, that is, it is not dependent upon other tasks,
although it may fall in a sequence with other tasks in a duty or job array.
Task Certifier—See Certification Official.
Trainer—A trained and qualified person who teaches Airmen to perform specific tasks through OJT.
Also, this identifies equipment that the trainer uses to teach Airmen specified tasks.
Training Detachment (TD)—An Air Education and Training Command (AETC) detachment that
provides maintenance-oriented technical training at an operational location on specific systems and their
aerospace ground equipment. A TD aims to: (1) qualify personnel on new equipment or in new
techniques and procedures, (2) maintain proficiency and to increase skill and knowledge, (3) acquaint
personnel with specific systems, and (4) keep personnel aware of changing concepts and requirements.
Upgrade Training—Training that leads to the award of a higher skill level.
