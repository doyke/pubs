1. Introduction:
     1.1. AFMC Enterprise Information Services (AFMC EIS) is a web enabled, information
     technology based platform providing a set of capabilities supporting many knowledge worker
     tasks. The goal of AFMC EIS is to improve awareness, knowledge, accuracy and
     productivity of AFMC workers through the deployment of standard enterprise Information
     Technology (IT) resources that facilitate standard information management and knowledge
     operations processes. EIS consists of Active Risk Manager (ARM), Project Server,
     Enterprise Information Management (EIM), and other capabilities.
     1.2. The Air Force (AF) Portal provides Enterprise/Centralized content for all AF
     Organizations, Bases, Functional Areas and Organizations outside AF, DoD and non-DoD
     partners and Allied Forces. The goal of the AF Portal is to provide information to the rest of
     the Air Force as it pertains to your Organization and is accessible to all military and civilian
     personnel, as well as approved users, 24/7 via .mil/.com.
2. Background:
     2.1. In 2007, SAF/A6 & CIO and SAF/AA approved Microsoft SharePoint as the document
     management and workflow capability tool to enhance the AF Enterprise Information
     Management (EIM) project--an initiative to deploy a set of standard office automation
     solutions. AFMC EIS guidance is provided in memorandums signed by SAF/XC and
     AFMC/CC (Attachment 2 and Attachment 3).
     2.2. Since 2008, the AF Portal has been the designated source for hosting all AF enterprise
     level static web content; while eliminating the use of private .mil websites and servers. In
     this document, users will gain a better understanding of what their role and responsibilities
     are, to include proper permission assignment, content management review and required
     documented training records.
3. Roles and Responsibilities: The following instruction provides guidance condensing
information from the EIS/EIM Support Center, but is not all inclusive and not limited to:
     3.1. EIM.
        3.1.1. Unit Commanders will:
            3.1.1.1. Identify a primary and alternate Site Owner for Organizational and
            Community sites and ensure new appointees visit the EIM Support Center to
            familiarize themselves with SharePoint and take the self paced training and/or attend
            the Site Owners training course offered by the Education & Training Flight.
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI33-301 4 APRIL 2013                                                      3


        3.1.1.2. Provide appointment letter and proof of EIM training signed by the Unit
        Commander to wing or base content manager. See Attachment 6, appointment
        letter. This letter and proof of EIM training can also be copied and pasted into an
        email and electronically signed by the Unit Commander.
     3.1.2. Site Owners/Users:
        3.1.2.1. Are responsible for understanding and following the AFMC EIM concepts
        contained in this instruction and on the EIS/EIM Support Center.
        3.1.2.2. EIM should be used as a collaboration tool for doing day-to-day work. It is
        not a replacement tool for the Electronic Records Management (ERM) system and not
        approved as an official records management repository.
        3.1.2.3. Will review document libraries housing folders/documents every 180 days in
        an effort to move Air Force records to the ERM, and eliminate duplicated documents,
        archived information and improperly marked restricted areas. Reference EIM Site
        Owner Review Procedures para 3.1.10.
        3.1.2.4. Will ensure appropriate permission assignment is given to document libraries
        containing folders/documents with Privacy Act (PA)/Personally Identifiable
        Information (PII), Source Selection Sensitive, Scientific and Technical Information
        (STINFO), Foreign Disclosure, Export Control Laws and any data driven by law or
        regulation. Reference business practices para 3.1.8.3. and para 3.1.8.4.
        3.1.2.5. Site owners/users are prohibited from purchasing or installing SharePoint
        outside of the AFMC EIM (NOTE: commercial software, government off-the-shelf
        technology and local development are specifically prohibited). EIM is the official Air
        Force collaboration tool. EIM is to be used as a unit/organization’s area for hosting
        dynamic content and active files for conducting day-to-day operations and business.
        Use of shared drives should be minimized and shared drives should not be used
        instead of EIM. Official records will not be permanently stored in EIM, but rather be
        moved to ERM when made a final draft for record.
     3.1.3. Business Practices.
        3.1.3.1. Information is shared to the widest extent possible. Visitor permissions will
        be enabled in EIM as read-only by default. There is a tendency to lock down
        permissions on EIM folders unnecessarily by default. The exception is Controlled
        Unclassified Information (CUI) which is restricted from dissemination by laws,
        regulations, and policies. Some of these classifications are Privacy Act Information,
        Source Selection Sensitive, Intellectual Property (e.g. company proprietary and trade
        secrets), Information subject to the foreign disclosure and/or export control laws,
        Scientific and Technical Information (STINFO) (e.g. weapon system technical
        publications) and Foreign Disclosure. The culture of the knowledge worker should
        be one of information sharing instead of information hoarding. DoDD 8320.02 states:
        “Data assets will be made accessible by making data available in shared spaces. All
        data assets will be accessible to all users in the Department of Defense except where
        limited by law, policy, or security classification.”

    3.1.3.2. Everyone is a visitor. Every organization site or community site front page,
    no matter how "buried" it is in the site collection, will be open to all authenticated
    AFMC        personnel     with     "visitor"     permissions     (by     selecting "NT
    AUTHORITY\authenticated users"). This will maximize collaboration, let people
    know the community or an organization exists, and let people see who the leadership
    or POCs are to find out more about that organization or community. Exceptions to
    this rule are top level source selection team sites, subsites dedicated to an
    organization’s personnel activities, or other sites/subsites dedicated to information
    that has a legal obligation to secure, i.e., CUI as described in para 3.1.8.1.
    3.1.3.3. FOUO Information Protection. For Official Use Only (FOUO) information
    is unclassified information that may be exempt from release under the Freedom of
    Information Act (FOIA) under exemptions 2 through 9 of the FOIA, and the Privacy
    Act (PA) of 1974. FOUO generally needs no special protection under EIM as EIM is
    inclusive to DoD. FOUO is not authorized as an anemic form of classification to
    protect national security interests. (DoD Reg 5400.7/AF Sup, DoD FOIA Program,
    C4.1.1). Exemptions from disclosure to the public will be coordinated through the
    Base FOIA/PA Manager to ensure legal ramifications are considered. Subject matter
    experts can contact the FOIA/PA Office at 937-522-3095 for further information.
    3.1.3.4. Mark all information requiring restricted permissions. Documents uploaded
    to restricted areas will be marked appropriately for the types of data they contain
    (such as “FOUO”, “Privacy Act” or “STINFO”).
    3.1.3.5. Minimize full control permissions. Site owners with full control permissions
    should be kept to a minimum (two to three personnel) for site integrity and security.
    3.1.3.6. Assign permissions to groups, not individuals. Assigning individual
    permissions creates a permissions environment that is difficult to manage. Site-wide
    permissions for groups can be viewed, individual permissions cannot. Group
    permissions support a role based permissions environment which allows a departing
    individual to be replaced by a new individual easily – the new individual inherits all
    of the correct permissions for the role.
    3.1.3.7. AFMC Templates. When setting up a new page or subsite, site owners will
    use the AFMC templates. (e.g. AFMC document library, AFMC standard
    organization, and the AFMC community site templates).
    3.1.3.8. Document library restricted permissions. Libraries will have an (R)
    appended to the end of the document library name to notate a document library with
    restricted permissions. The description will contain notice as to why it is restricted
    and to what groups it is restricted for future reference.
    3.1.3.9. Unique Permissions. Do not create unique permissions for items below the
    container (subsite/list/library) level unless absolutely necessary (e.g. alert rosters,
    timecards, finance/GPC, other CUI/PII-driven processes).
    3.1.3.10. Versioning. Always use the AFMC Document Library template which will
    enable versioning for all libraries for five previous versions.
    3.1.3.11. Group Names. Group names should always begin with the site name.
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI33-301 4 APRIL 2013                                                        5


        3.1.3.12. Container Descriptions. Always include a detailed description of the
        container. Any time you create a site, library, or list, BE SURE to provide a
        DESCRIPTION of the container. Include the purpose, type of information allowed,
        intended audience, and whether the container is restricted access. (For libraries, also
        include in the description the number of versions enabled if changed from the
        default.)
        3.1.3.13. EIM training. Site members and site owners will use standardized AFMC-
        provided EIM training. Standardized training may be supplemented but cannot
        contradict AFMC EIM training guidance. Two sources of classroom training are
        classes offered during 88 ABW Focus Week and training provided by the Education
        & Training Flight (88 FSS/FSDE).
        3.1.3.14. Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP). Personnel will reference and
        follow approved EIM Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures on the TTP page at
        https://cs.eis.afmc.af.mil/sites/eisusersupport/eimsupportcenter/pages/TTPs.aspx
        .
     3.1.4. Document Management.
        3.1.4.1. One working copy in one location. Links will point to one working copy in
        lieu of uploading multiple copies of a document. The document should be checked
        out for editing and checked back in when editing is completed. This will prevent
        changes from being overwritten by preventing the document from being edited by
        more than one person at a time.
        3.1.4.2. Send URLs instead of attachments in e-mail. Personnel will send EIM,
        ARM, Project Server, Air Force Portal, or internet uniform resource locator (URL)
        document links via E-mail and not the actual documents. This applies only within an
        enclave that is accessible by all. Document attachments may still be sent via E-mail
        when necessary (i.e. leaving AFMC). A URL can be inserted as a hyperlink with a
        convenient name. Follow Tip 15 (Inserting EIM links into E-mail) at:
        https://cs.eis.afmc.af.mil/sites/eisusersupport/eimsupportcenter/TipOfTheWeek/
        Forms/Input%20View.aspx.
        3.1.4.3. Maximum four folders deep. The number of nested folders (folders within
        folders) in a document library will be kept to four levels (a folder within a folder
        within a folder within a folder within a document library at the maximum). Zero
        folders up to two nested folders is ideal. Too many nested folders in a document
        library leads to buried information and difficult navigation for the user. An additional
        technical limitation driving limiting nested folders is that EIM only works with URLs
        up to 260 characters long. In lieu of multiple folders, files can be grouped by using
        file      name       conventions      within      a       folder.    (TTP       RM-02)
        https://cs.eis.afmc.af.mil/sites/eisusersupport/eimsupportcenter/pages/TTPs.
     3.1.5. EIM Site Owner Review Procedures. For AFMC EIM to provide a secure and
     consistent experience for the community, it is essential that a periodic review of all
     AFMC EIM Organization, Community, Conference Room, and ‘Team’ sites be
     conducted at least every 180 days. This review will ensure that EIM sites are up-to-date,
     consistent, and have proper permission structures in place.
6                                  WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI33-301 4 APRIL 2013


    3.1.5.1. Check Site Content. Is the site content consistent with the type of site?
    Organization site content is to be used for the "care and feeding" of the personnel in
    the organization. Community site content is to be used to support the "work or
    services" the organization does, and to allow collaboration between the organization
    and its customers.
    3.1.5.2. Check Site Permissions. Select “Site Actions” then “Site Settings” then
    “Advanced Permissions.” Does the site use “unique permissions” with its own set of
    Member, Owner, and Visitor site groups? (The rare exception withstanding, an
    organization or community site should not inherit permissions from its parent. If the
    permissions from the parent site support the child site, why was the child site
    required? A reworking of the Site’s permissions may be required).
    3.1.5.3. Check Site Groups for permissions. Are permissions provided only to Site
    Groups? The AFMC EIM design only allows the assignment of permissions to “EIM
    Groups”. Direct assignment to Active Directory (AD) groups, Exchange groups or
    Individuals will be difficult to maintain. Use a lot of forethought when deciding how
    many Site Groups to use. Even Site Groups need maintenance now and then. If
    updates or additional groups are needed, use the following steps.
       3.1.5.3.1. Create new Site Groups to support the roles related to the site.
       3.1.5.3.2. Move individual users or AD/Exchange groups into the appropriate
       Site Group based on the related role.
       3.1.5.3.3. It may be necessary to create new AD groups to support functional
       roles that require access across multiple Site Collections.
    3.1.5.4. Does each Site Group have only one “Permission Level”? Only one
    “Permission Level” (Contribute, Full Control, Read) should be assigned to a given
    site group. The “Permission Levels” typically include all of the lower level
    permission settings. Restricted/Modified Permissions. It is possible and permitted, to
    break permission inheritance on Lists, Libraries, and Folders when absolutely
    required.
    3.1.5.5. Check Access Requests. Select “Settings” then “Access Requests.”           Is
    “Allow requests for access” checked and a Site Owner email provided?
    3.1.5.6. Check People and Groups. Select “Site Actions” then “Site Settings” then
    “People and Groups.” Do the local Members, Owners, and Visitors (MOV) groups
    display in the “Group Quick Launch” (Quick Launch Bar on left side of EIM site)? If
    not edit the “Group Quick Launch” accordingly.
       3.1.5.6.1. For each local MOV group select “Setting” then “Group Settings.”
           3.1.5.6.1.1. The title should start with the site name.
           3.1.5.6.1.2. The group owner should be the Site Owners group.
           3.1.5.6.1.3. The membership should be visible to “Everyone.”
           3.1.5.6.1.4. The editor of the group should be the Site Owners group.
       3.1.5.6.2. Check the membership of the Members group. Is the membership of
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI33-301 4 APRIL 2013                                                         7


            the Members group consistent with the data on the “Site Information Form”? For
            organization sites this typically means the “Org All” Active Directory group has
            been added, and for Community sites individuals or Functional Active Directory
            Groups have been added.
            3.1.5.6.3. Check the membership of the Owners group. Is the membership of the
            Owners group consistent with the data on the “Site Information Form”? AFMC
            EIM is looking for 2-3 Site Owners for a given site.
            3.1.5.6.4. Check the membership of the Visitors group. Is the membership of the
            Visitors group consistent with the data on the “Site Information Form”? Usually
            this means it is the system entry “NT AUTHORITY\authenticated users” to open
            the site to all of AFMC.
         3.1.5.7. Check the Nested Folders in a Document Library. Is the number of nested
         folders (folders within folders) kept to a maximum of four? Too many nested folders
         in a document library leads to buried information and difficult navigation for the user.
         Zero folders up to two nested folders is ideal.
         3.1.5.8. Check Site Theme. Select “Site Actions” then “Site Settings” then “Site
         Theme.” Is the site theme set to the AFMC EIM Standard based on site type? Are the
         standard web parts in place? Leadership, site assistance, logo? Is extra content added
         below standard content?
            3.1.5.8.1. “Lichen” for Organization sites.
            3.1.5.8.2. “Belltown” for Community sites.
            3.1.5.8.3. “Breeze” for Conference Room sites.
            3.1.5.8.4. “Classic” for Team sites.
  3.2. AF Portal:
     3.2.1. Unit Commanders will:
         3.2.1.1. Ensure their AF Portal Content Managers and Content Publishers receive
         training on portal publishing (AF Portal Publishing Training (AFPPT)) and ensure
         this training is documented.
         3.2.1.2. Appoint their AF Portal Content Managers and Content Publishers in
         writing. Unit Content Managers and Content Publishers should be a knowledge
         operations manager (AFSC3A0XX or civilian equivalent) to the maximum extent
         possible. The wing or base level Content Manager will maintain the appointment
         letters for their organization.
            3.2.1.2.1. Provide appointment letter and proof of Portal training signed by the
            Unit Commander to wing or base content manager. See Attachment 4,
            appointment letter. This letter and proof of Portal training can also be copied and
            pasted into an email and electronically signed by the Unit Commander.
     3.2.2. Wing/Group/Unit AF Portal Content Manager. Each group/unit supplying AF
     Portal page information for posting on the AF Portal appoints an AF Portal Content
8                                    WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI33-301 4 APRIL 2013


    Manager responsible for information on their respective pages. Group/Unit Content
    Managers will:
