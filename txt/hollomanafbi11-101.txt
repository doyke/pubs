                                            Chapter 1

                               GENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Management Objectives. The instruction has two objectives. The first is to provide a
process that delivers accurate flying schedules to all units and Holloman AFB senior leadership,
minimizing last minute changes and avoiding wasted resources. The second is to standardize the
operations scheduling process. All scheduling agencies must operate from the same set of rules
to ensure no loss of training and proper communication of their operational needs.
1.2. 49 OSS/OSOS Responsibilities. Wing Scheduling (49 OSS/OSOS) will oversee the 49
WG operations scheduling process and is the focal point for all scheduling related issues.
49 OSS/OSOS normal office hours are 0730-1630L Monday- Friday. Wing Scheduling may be
contacted      at   DSN      572-3536/572-3537,        Fax     572-3139,    or email    at
49OSS.osos.Ops.Scheduling@holloman.af.mil. After hours, contact 575-430-1764 for the on-
call scheduler. Wing Scheduling is responsible for the following functions:
     1.2.1. The building and deconfliction of quarterly 49 WG airspace flow plans and overseeing
     Flying Hour Program (FHP) development.
     1.2.2. Schedule the Holloman managed airspace defined in Flight Information Publications
     (FLIP) and Holloman AFB Instruction 11-250, Airfield Operations Instruction, for all users.
     Scheduling all non-managed airspace required by 49 Operations Group (49 OG), Flight
     Training Center (FTC), and TDY flying squadrons through appropriate owning agencies. 49
     OSS/OSOS schedules training airspace.
     1.2.3. Compile and distribute the 49 WG Daily Flying Schedule.
     1.2.4. Consolidate briefings for the 49 OG/49th Maintenance Group (49 MXG) & 49th Wing
     (49 WG) weekly scheduling meetings.
     1.2.5. Create and maintain the Supervisor of Flying (SOF) schedule.
     1.2.6. Conduct 49 WG Flying Hour Program Management and act as wing point of contact
     (POC) to Air Combat Command (ACC).
     1.2.7. Manage air refueling requests for 49 OG and FTC flying squadrons.
     1.2.8. Administer the incentive and orientation flight programs, coordinate fly-over requests,
     static display requests, and quiet hour programs.
HOLLOMANAFBI11-101 23 OCTOBER 2013                                                              3


                                           Chapter 2

                               SCHEDULING PROCEDURES

2.1. General. The 49 OSS/OSOS is responsible for publishing the combined daily flying
schedule. The published schedule will include all locally flown aircraft belonging to
permanently assigned units, tenant units, and units TDY to Holloman AFB. The primary
airspace for Holloman based units is designated as “Joint Use” and is owned by three agencies
with differing timeline requirements and priorities. “Joint Use” policy mandates that military
users should acquire only that airspace required for mission accomplishment and return airspace
to the National Airspace System (NAS) in a timely manner when not in use or when no longer
required. In order to build and publish an accurate and efficient schedule, all units must
understand and comply with the operations scheduling procedures. Holloman based units
hosting TDY units are responsible for ensuring they follow all local rules, regulations and
guidelines. Units requesting to schedule airspace through Holloman AFB will receive a pertinent
airspace or area brief by the airspace manager.

Section 2A—Building Forecast Schedules

2.2. Quarterly Flowplan. The 49 OSS/OSOS publishes and distributes a quarterly flowplan. It
is the 49 WG’s primary tool to set training airspace priority and deconflict local flying units at
Holloman AFB. The flowplan is published in the 1st week of Jan, April, July, and Oct for the
following quarter (i.e. the flowplan published in Jan is for Apr-Jun). Each squadron will provide
inputs to the plan based upon training requirements no later than (NLT) the second Monday of
the month preceding publishing the flowplan (e.g., in March for the April publishing date). The
flowplan will be reviewed for squadron approval during the normal airspace deconfliction
meeting on the second Thursday of month prior to publication. Units will ensure a representative
authorized to approve the flowplan attends that meeting. The flowplan will be approved at the
49 OG/49 MXG scheduling meeting by the 49th Operations Group Commander (49 OG/CC).
2.3. Monthly Scheduling Flow. No later than the second Friday of each month, squadron
schedulers will input their flying schedule requests into Center Scheduling Enterprise (CSE) for
the following month. This allows 49 OSS/OSOS to meet scheduling requirements with White
Sands Missile Range (WSMR) and Ft. Bliss (FTB).
2.4. Weekly Scheduling Flow. Weekly scheduling flow is shown below. Squadron schedulers
will coordinate with their maintenance counterparts on any unusual requirements for the
upcoming week as required. Squadron schedulers must meet all deadlines to enable 49
OSS/OSOS to meet suspenses to higher headquarters and outside agencies.
   2.4.1. THURSDAY - 11 days prior to effective date 49 OSS/OSOS will conduct a weekly
   Airspace Scheduling Meeting in the OSS conference room. All discrepancies and conflicts
   will be resolved between squadron schedulers at the weekly meeting. This is a mandatory
   meeting and one scheduler from each squadron must attend. If Thursday is a productivity
   day or holiday, the meeting will be rescheduled by 49 OSS/OSOS and each squadron
   scheduling shop will be notified.
NOTE: Squadron schedulers are responsible for complying with the quarterly flow plan for
Takeoff (T/O) and airspace times. Squadron failure to comply with the assigned windows may
 4                                              HOLLOMANAFBI11-101 23 OCTOBER 2013


result in loss of usable airspace. Squadrons unable to comply with the airspace plan due to
unforeseen problems and circumstances will be handled on a case-by-case basis. All conflicts
will be resolved at Thursday's scheduling meeting. Any requested changes to range or takeoff
times made after Thursday's Airspace Scheduling meeting must be made through 49 OSS/OSOS.
     2.4.2. FRIDAY - 10-days prior to effective date, squadron schedulers are responsible for
     entering a schedule shell into Patriot Excalibur (PEX) scheduling tool by 1200L. If Friday is
     a productivity day or holiday, squadrons provide the shell by 1200L Thursday.

Section 2B—Building Daily Schedules

2.5. Daily Scheduling Flow. Daily scheduling flow is shown below. Squadron schedulers and
49 OSS/OSOS airspace coordinators must meet all deadlines to ensure all airspace scheduled
will be available for next day's flying.
     2.5.1. 49 OSS/OSOS will confirm the next day’s restrictions with White Sands Missile
     Range and Ft Bliss scheduling offices and pass them to the flying units. Wing scheduling
     will produce a “First Look” with scheduled airspace for the next day and post it in CSE for
     use by the flying units. This will normally be completed by 0900L daily.
     2.5.2. Squadrons will provide the names of scheduled SOF(s), Operations Supervision (i.e.
     Top-3 or equivalent), and Distinguished Visitors (DVs) that are flying with the unit for the
     next day’s schedule to Wing scheduling. Airspace scheduling will normally contact each
     unit for this information around 1000L, but is required NLT 1100L each morning.
     2.5.3. 49 OSS/OSOS will pass any range restrictions that change to all affected units as soon
     as possible (ASAP) by telephone. The restrictions page in CSE will also be updated and
     coded by letter (ie. A,B,C…) to show the most current version of restrictions.
     2.5.4. Airspace Co-sharing – ACC units require “exclusive use” in ACC managed airspace.
     Exclusive Use of Airspace—Only participating aircraft engaged in the same mission or
     activity are authorized to operate simultaneously within a specified airspace area. This does
     not prohibit the scheduling activity/airspace manager from segregating separate missions
     and/or activities through airspace subdivisions/altitude blocks to use airspace and support
     mission requirements efficiently.
        2.5.4.1. If a user (requestor) wants to use airspace already scheduled by another unit
        (owning unit), the requestor is required to coordinate approval with the owning unit to
        deconflict the airspace. If the owning unit approves airspace release to the requestor,
        both the owning unit and requestor must contact 49 OSS/OSOS and notify them of the
        request, owning unit approval, and altitudes/airspace affected. 49 OSS/OSOS will pass
        this information to any affected agencies. If the owning unit does not completely release
        airspace to the requestor (i.e., intends to co-share) the owning unit and requesting unit are
        responsible for developing a mutually acceptable deconfliction plan.
     2.5.5. Squadrons will provide a unit-level approved next day’s flying schedule to 49
     OSS/OSOS via entry into PEX NLT 1400L. Unit schedulers should include a turn back of
     any airspace not planned for use at this time in CSE. This suspense may, at 49 OSS/OSOS
     discretion, be set later for wing-wide night flying.
HOLLOMANAFBI11-101 23 OCTOBER 2013                                                            5


   2.5.6. Squadrons will notify 49 OSS/OSOS if schedule changes are required after the initial
   coordinated schedule has been provided. Enter the changes in PEX and call 49 OSS/OSOS
   by phone to let them know changes were made.
   2.5.7. 49 OSS/OSOS will pass call signs to Cherokee by 1500L each day for the next day's
   duty schedule.
   2.5.8. 49 OSS/OSOS will commit the following day’s schedule for publishing at 1500L
   daily. Due to WSMR scheduling timelines, notification of daily schedule publishing for the
   following day will normally be sent via email to flying units and base agencies supporting
   flying by 1500L each day. Flying unit schedule changes received by 49 OSS/OSOS after
   1500L the day prior will be coordinated as soon as practical, NLT 0700L the next morning.

Section 2C—Execution of Daily Schedule

2.6. Day of Changes. The following changes refer to airspace issues. Units must still
coordinate changes with maintenance in accordance with (IAW) AFI 21-101, Aircraft and
Equipment Maintenance Management and CAFI 21-165, Aircraft Flying and Maintenance
Scheduling Procedures as supplemented.
   2.6.1. 49 OSS/OSOS is responsible for making all day of changes to airspace during normal
   operating hours. After normal operating hours, units should contact the on call scheduler for
   airspace issues at 575-430-1764. 49 OSS/OSOS will coordinate day of scheduling changes
   with all appropriate agencies. Day of changes are handled as soon as possible upon
   notification. Under no circumstances will the squadron attempt to obtain their own airspace
   except as stated in para 2.5.4.
   2.6.2. Flying squadrons will enter in CSE and PEX all changes which affect the use of
   airspace and ranges, including take-off times, call sign, configuration, or airspace and call
   49 OSS/OSOS by phone to let them know changes were made. Major changes such as
   adding sorties or complete change in mission may be called in first to expedite coordination.
   Cancelled missions already on the schedule may be called in.
   2.6.3. Unused Airspace. If airspace is scheduled and will not be used, the squadron must
   inform 49 OSS/OSOS as soon as possible so that the airspace may be released for use by
   another agency. Available airspace will be scheduled as needed. 49 OSS/OSOS will return
   airspace to NAS, by calling Albuquerque center, as soon as it is determined that the airspace
   is no longer needed. NOTE: WSMR Research and Development (R&D) missions take
   priority in WSMR Airspace. If change occurs in scheduled airspace, WSMR is responsible
   for notifying 49 OSS/OSOS. These notifications could be hours or minutes before scheduled
   range time. 49 OSS/OSOS is responsible for notifying affected squadrons ASAP, and will
   work alternative airspace.

Section 2D—Airspace Scheduling Guidelines

2.7. Priority. 49 OSS/OSOS schedules a large volume of local and off-station sorties daily. 49
OSS/OSOS will attempt to contact both local and off-station users to shift airspace/range times
to try to accommodate all users as much as possible and maximize the use of the airspace/ranges.
After WSMR passes range availability and airspace restrictions, training airspace will be
scheduled using the following priority:
 6                                             HOLLOMANAFBI11-101 23 OCTOBER 2013


     2.7.1. 49 WG High Priority Requests.
     2.7.2. Squadrons assigned to the 49 WG (including FTC).
     2.7.3. All other non-49 WG agency airspace requests.
2.8. High Priority Requests. 49 WG flying squadrons are required to provide 49 OSS/OSOS
with WSMR high priority airspace/range requests NLT close of business (COB) Monday, six
weeks prior to the required period. These high priority requests will cover events such as Fighter
Weapons Instructor Course (FWIC), live weapons employment, live countermeasures
employment, very important person (VIP) flights, Search and Rescue Exercise (SAREX)
exercises, competitions, etc. 49 OSS/OSOS will also require dates, number and type of aircraft,
specific ranges required, range times, ordnance, and any other information that is pertinent to the
mission. 49 OSS/OSOS will be responsible for forwarding this information to WSMR
scheduling, so they can include our requests in the published WSMR Monthly Schedule. If
manning permits 49 OSS/OSOS will send a representative to the WSMR weekly scheduling
meeting each Wednesday.
2.9. Albuquerque Controlled Airspace. Albuquerque Air Route Traffic Control Center
(ARTCC) controlled airspace is normally booked the day prior by 49 OSS/OSOS. If this
airspace is requested day of, Albuquerque center requires 30 minutes lead time if the time
requested is within the published hours of operation [for the military operating areas (MOAs) –
Sunrise to Sunset]. If requested time is not within the published hours of operation, a lead time
of 2 hours and 30 minutes is required.
     2.9.1. Special Use Airspace Denial. If Albuquerque denies or restricts a scheduling request
     of Holloman managed airspace, scheduling will initiate a denial report, Attachment 3. If the
     denial occurs during mission execution, scheduling will request the affected squadron file a
     denial report. The airspace manager will document and track denial reports for trends and
     report to HQ ACC/A3AA.
2.10. WSMR Controlled Airspace. 49 OSS/OSOS monitors a forecast for the restrictions on
WSMR airspace 14 days prior to the actual use. Changes to restrictions after this time should be
minimal. Actual restrictions are published the day prior for scheduling purposes, as referred to
in para 2.5.1. 49 OSS/OSOS is required to coordinate requested airspace with WSMR each
morning by 0900L. Certain portions of R-5107 require 12 hour advance notice to Albuquerque
ARTCC, therefore late day-of extensions to WSMR controlled airspace may not be possible.
The airspace is subject to last minute changes due to the nature of certain R&D tests. WSMR
R&D missions take priority in WSMR Airspace. If change occurs in scheduled airspace, WSMR
is responsible for notifying 49 OSS/OSOS. Units should be aware these notifications could be
hours or minutes before their scheduled range time.
2.11. Ft Bliss Controlled Airspace. R-5103 airspace is released by Ft Bliss () scheduling to 49
OSS/OSOS weekly to allow scheduling of CENTENNIAL range. During periods that 49
OSS/OSOS schedules the airspace, Cherokee controls access to R-5103C, and when scheduled,
R-5103B. For airspace activation purposes, 49 OSS/OSOS will coordinate an upper altitude
limit for R-5103C and any use of R-5103B as available the day prior to use.
2.12. Scheduling of Ranges. 49 OSS/OSOS is the scheduling agency for the airspace in
Attachment 2. Included are three ACC operated air-to-ground bombing ranges: OSCURA, RED
RIO, and CENTENNIAL. In addition to scheduling the range and airspace with 49 OSS/OSOS,
HOLLOMANAFBI11-101 23 OCTOBER 2013                                                                7


units will ensure they receive a briefing from 49 OSS/OSOR prior to their use of the ranges. All
live drop activities in Red Rio will be approved by 49 OSS/OSOR.
2.13. Scheduling Ground Parties. This section amplifies scheduling procedures for range
management, and ground parties such as (Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTAC)), Forward
Air Controllers (FAC) personnel, etc. to schedule 49 WG--coordinated ground and air assets
operating in CENTENNIAL, OSCURA, and RED RIO ranges. In addition, units will ensure
they receive a briefing from 49 OSS/OSOR prior to their use of the ranges.
   2.13.1. Both units sponsoring a ground party and the ground party will contact 49
   OSS/OSOS NLT 0900L Monday, two weeks prior to requested use to confirm scheduling.
   2.13.2. 49 OSS/OSOS will coordinate with the ground party in the same manner they work
   with flying units with the following two additions. They will also confirm times the morning
   of the mission to ensure any last minute restrictions/changes are provided to the ground
   party. The times coordinated for the ground party will always be referenced as “Gate entry
   to Gate exit” times. 49th OSOS will coordinate ground parties with the appropriate Army
   scheduling office.
   2.13.3. 49 OSS/OSOS will plan a minimum of 30 minutes for ground parties to transit from
   the gate to the Observation Positions (OP). During the transit time, until otherwise
   coordinated, the range will be restricted “NO LASE/NO DROP.” The same criteria will
   apply when ground parties exit the range. Unless otherwise coordinated, 49 OSS/OSOS will
   only schedule JTAC/FAC ground parties within a sponsoring unit’s airspace times, therefore,
   JTAC/FAC parties will not plan deliveries up to the aircraft unit’s last second of range time.
   2.13.4. Maintenance ground parties will always be restricted “NO LASE/NO DROP” for the
   entire period. Airspace above the ranges may be scheduled by flying units, but not the air-to-
   ground range.
2.14. Scheduling Transitions between Albuquerque Center/Cherokee Control
Airspace. When Albuquerque (ABQ) Center retains control of its airspace (Beaks, Cowboys,
Ancho), transitions will be scheduled as follows: By 1500L day prior, squadron schedulers will
notify 49 OSS/OSOS (572-3536/572-3537) of any missions planning to execute an ABQ
Center/Cherokee Control airspace transition(s). 49 OSS/OSOS will annotate "Transitions will
occur between R-5107 and/or R-5103C and the Cowboy/Ancho ATCAAs." in the remarks
section of the call sign sheet sent to Cherokee Control for the applicable call signs, airspace, and
times.
2.15. Military Training Routes (MTR). Non-Holloman AFB assigned pilots require a briefing
from the Holloman Airspace Manager (49 OSS/OSOA) prior to operating on Holloman managed
low-level routes.
   2.15.1. MTRs will be scheduled in CSE along with associated airspace. If a route needs to
   be closed, the airspace manager will notify 49 OSS/OSOS, who will notify scheduled units as
   well as Base Operations and Albuquerque center.

2.16. Takeoff Waivers. ACC quiet hours are scheduled from 2230-0600L daily IAW HAFBI
11-250, Airfield Operations Instruction. 49 WG aircraft deviating from quiet hour times are
approved 1 week prior by the 49 OG/CC at the weekly scheduling meeting. Off station aircraft
requesting to deviate from quiet hour restrictions will be considered on a case-by-case basis
directed through Airfield Manager located at Base Operations for approval/disapproval.
HOLLOMANAFBI11-101 23 OCTOBER 2013                                                               9

                                       AIR REFUELING

3.1. Monthly. Squadrons will provide 49 OSS/OSOS with an air refueling forecast/request for
the next month as soon as possible, but NLT the 7th of the month preceding the request. Each
unit forecast must include the following items: Date, Air Refueling Control Time (ARCT), Air
Refueling track, number of receivers, total offload, and any special requirements. 49 OSS/OSOS
is then responsible for completing and sending pre-coordination requests, and entering all pre-
coordinated and other requests into the Air Refueling Management System IAW AFI 11-221, Air
Refueling Management (KC-10 and KC-135), and current policy. After input and a trading
period, Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) publishes a Quarterly Air Refueling Schedule or
“HORSEBLANKET” showing pre-coordinated, long range tasked, and untasked missions. IAW
with TACC policy, 49 OSS/OSOS resubmits selected untasked missions as short range requests
monthly.
3.2. Weekly. Each Thursday, 49 OSS/OSOS will display a summary of all requested and
scheduled tanker activity to squadron schedulers at the weekly scheduling meeting. To ensure
adequate planning time 49 OSS/OSOS will confirm Air-to-Air Refueling (AAR) details with the
tanker and receiver units two weeks prior to the AAR.
3.3. Short Notice Requests. To request additional (Short Notice) tankers that were not
previously requested or published on the Quarterly Air Refueling Schedule due to unforeseen
commitments or requirements, squadrons must notify 49 OSS/OSOS as soon as possible prior to
the date the tanker is needed. Short-Notice additional tanker requests do not have a high
percentage of success as few uncommitted tanker flying hours are available after publishing the
Quarterly Air Refueling Schedule.
NOTE: There is no-guarantee of tanker support through the short-notice system, therefore users
should make every attempt to satisfy air refueling requirements through the quarterly scheduling
process. Once a short-notice request is firmed up, tanker units may still cancel request at any
time, without deviation.
3.4. Changes/Delays/Cancellations. Receiver delays or cancellations must be coordinated with
49 OSS/OSOS as soon as possible, so the tanker agency can be notified. If a change is required
in the air refueling track due to weather, 49 OSS/OSOS, will be responsible for scheduling an
alternate. Late moves to alternate air refueling tracks may affect available offload. If the tanker
unit has a delay or cancellation, 49 OSS/OSOS or 49 WG/CPO will be notified and is
responsible for notifying the affected squadron. If a 49 WG squadron needs to cancel a tanker
already on the HORSEBLANKET, they must give adequate advance notice.

                     MISCELLANEOUS SCHEDULING ACTIVITIES

4.1. Off-Station Unit Airspace Scheduling. Wing scheduling makes every effort to utilize the
airspace as efficiently as possible. This includes working off-station users into the airspace as
available.     Off-Station users must fax (DSN 572-3139) or e-mail requests to
49OSS.ososOpsScheduling@holloman.af.mil one week prior, so they can be incorporated into
the weekly flow with Holloman AFB flying units.
4.2. FCF/OCF Flights. Functional Check Flight (FCF)/Operational Check Flight (OCF) flights
are coordinated by the squadron through 49 OG. After approval by 49 OG/CC, airspace will be
requested through 49 OSS/OSOS.
4.3. Quiet Hours. Holloman AFB units desiring Quiet Hours for special functions are
responsible for submitting a request letter through 49 OSS/OSOS NLT 2 weeks prior to the event
so that flying and range schedules may be modified. Quiet Hour duration will comply with
current 49 OG policy. Event project officers should contact 49 OSS/OSOS for current policy
and to coordinate the best time for the event based on location, flying schedule, and DV
participation. The 49 OG/CC may request unit to re-work dates/times based on other
commitments.
   4.3.1. The 49 OSS/OSOS will log, prepare a summary, coordinate any scheduling
   deconfliction, and notify units and Airfield Management as required for the quiet hours
