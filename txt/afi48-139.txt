                                            Chapter 1

                                   PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Overview. This instruction incorporates guidance and criteria for the safe use of lasers and
laser systems as defined in the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Z136.1.
   1.1.1. ANSI Z136.1 classifies lasers according to the type of hazards they present and
   according to the extent of safety controls required. Classes range from the least hazardous,
   Class 1, through the most hazardous, Class 4. For Class 1 and Class 2 lasers, the letter M
   after the number refers to viewing the laser with optical aids so that the laser is magnified.
   Class 3 is divided into subcategories of Class 3R and Class 3B. The older ANSI designation
   for Class 3 was Class 3A and Class 3B. ANSI changed Class 3A to Class 3R with the R
   designating reduced risk. For reference, Table 1.1 below provides a general, but not all
   encompassing, description of the classes. All mandatory requirements are in this AFI. For a
   non-mandatory guide describing best force health protection management practices and
   information when working with lasers and laser systems use refer to the PHA Guide found
   on the Knowledge Exchange (Kx) website.

Table 1.1. Class Description.
     Class                                     Description
     1        Not recognized as hazardous
     1M       Could be hazardous if viewed with optical aids (telescopes, binoculars or loupes)
     2        Could be hazardous if viewed for > 0.25 seconds, on-axis
     2M       Increased hazard if viewed with optical aids
     3R       Potential direct and diffuse hazard if eye focused
     3B       Direct eye or skin exposure hazard
     4        Hazardous for direct or scattered exposure

   1.1.2. Military specific lasers that employ coherent radiation are lasers and laser systems
   used for combat, combat training, or classified in the interest of national security, and require
   AF Laser System Safety Review Board (LSSRB) approval prior to acquisition and/or
   employment. Examples include, but are not limited to: laser illuminators, designators, range
   finders, tactical pointers, tactical lasers, and lasers employed to augment explosive ordnance
   disposal. For lasers categorized as directed energy weapons (DEWs), AFI 91-401 shall be
   followed. The DoD, or its components, are authorized to exempt these lasers from portions
   or the entirety of Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 1010 and/or 1040 IAW
   with FDA Exemption No. 76EL-01. Hereafter, FDA Exemption No. 76EL-01will be
   referred to as simply FDA Exemption. This exemption applies only to the laser procurement
   process but not to laser safety. (T-0)
   1.1.3. FDA compliant lasers and laser systems are fully compliant with Title 21, CFR, Parts
   1010 and/or 1040 and do not fall under any category defined as military specific lasers.
   Examples include medical, industrial, laboratory, and communication lasers and laser
 6                                                            AFI48-139 30 SEPTEMBER 2014


     systems. FDA Compliant Lasers must have a FDA accession number issued to the
     manufacturer by the FDA or at least have compliance paperwork on file with the FDA for
     verification.
     1.1.4. For other optical radiation hazards, this instruction is based on the current Threshold
     Limit Values (TLVs®) for Physical Agents (Non-ionizing Radiation and Fields - Light and
     Near-Infrared Radiation and Ultraviolet Radiation) published by the American Conference of
     Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH®). Optical radiation hazards and controls for
     welding, cutting, and brazing are delineated in AFI 91-203, Air Force Consolidated
     Occupational Safety Instruction.
     1.1.5. Optical radiation includes incoherent, multi-wavelength (non-laser) sources of
     radiation in ultraviolet (UV) (180-400 nm), visible (400-700 nm), and infrared (700 nm-1000
     µm) wavelength regions. Examples of potentially hazardous broadband optical radiation
     sources include: intense radiant flashes and thermal energy from pyrotechnics or explosives,
     arcs, gas and vapor discharges, unshielded fluorescent or incandescent light sources, and UV
     exposures. Measurement equipment to assess these hazards, generally, is not available at
     base level; risk assessment and associated controls are typically based on manufacturer
     discussions and consultation with the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM)
     Environmental, Safety, Occupational Health (ESOH) Service Center. To contact the ESOH
     Service Center, call (toll free) 1-888-232-ESOH (3764), 937-938-3764 or DSN 798-3764, or
     send emails to esoh.service.center@us.af.mil.
     1.1.6. This instruction prescribes the use of an AF approved Occupational and
     Environmental Health - Management Information System (OEH-MIS) to standardize and
     enhance data entry, management, and reporting.          The Defense Occupational and
     Environmental Health Readiness System-Industrial Hygiene (DOEHRS-IH) is a DoD
     software program designed to provide a web-based information management system that will
     store and manage personal OEH exposure information and monitoring data, personal
     protective equipment (PPE) usage data, and employee health hazard education data.
1.2. Purpose. The purpose of the laser and optical radiation protection program is to protect
health and prevent injury that could have a debilitating effect on human performance. The
program is designed to define and mitigate laser related risks. This program is a key component
of the AF ESOH management system as directed in Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 90-8,
Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health. Effective identification and control of laser and
other optical radiation hazards is a force multiplier. Supervisors and commanders must: (T-0)
     1.2.1. Implement controls to mitigate risks for identified laser and other optical radiation
     hazards to an acceptable level;
     1.2.2. Ensure risk mitigation will be effected through engineering controls first. If research
     efforts show that engineering controls are not feasible then administrative controls can be
     considered, with SQ/CC, or higher, approval;
     1.2.3. Individual Protective Equipment (IPE) or PPE shall be considered a last resort for
     controlling a hazard. If engineering or administrative controls are not feasible, then the
     appropriate IPE/PPE must be made available and used to:
        1.2.3.1. Enhance workforce and mission capability;

                               INSTALLATION PROGRAM

3.1. General Guidelines.
   3.1.1. The program elements of this instruction augment those of the ANSI Z136 Series and
   are shared among workplace supervisors and other functional areas such as BE, PH, SEG,
   and healthcare providers. However, the ILSO has overall responsibility to the installation
   commander for the installation laser safety program, and as such shall be designated in
   writing, by the installation commander, as the final authority on all laser operations
   conducted within the installation’s areas of responsibility. (T-3)
   3.1.2. The fundamental aspects of a laser and optical radiation protection program shall
   include training, evaluation and control of direct and ancillary laser hazards, medical
   surveillance/examinations, and accident/incident investigation. (T-0)
   3.1.3. Personnel will not be intentionally exposed to laser radiation in excess of the
   maximum permissible exposure (MPE) levels (IAW ANSI Z136.1) and unnecessary
   exposures to laser radiation below the MPE will be avoided. This does not apply to patients
   receiving medical or dental treatment. (T-2)
   3.1.4. If an organization uses Class 3B or Class 4 lasers, the LSO at each level (ILSO and
   ULSO) shall be appointed by the commander at the appropriate level. (T-3)
   3.1.5. In addition to the ILSO, specialized ULSOs will be appointed based on the primary
   mission of the unit. ULSOs will consist of aircrew, industrial, medical, range, research, or
   tactical LSOs. (T-3)
3.2. LSO and User Training Criteria.
   3.2.1. Laser safety training shall be provided initially and annually to users of any Class 3B
   or 4 FDA-Compliant Lasers or military specific lasers, IAW with the training
   requirements/topics listed in the ANSI Z136 Series, military directives and requirements, and
   training specific to the laser(s) and laser system(s) used by the unit. Consult with
   USAFSAM for training requirements/topics. (T-0)
   3.2.2. AF LSO training requirements are based upon the primary mission of the unit to
   which the LSO is assigned and require varying levels of knowledge and training for each
   area. In consultation with the ILSO, the ULSO shall determine what, if any, training is
   commensurate with the laser hazards accessible at the unit level. Further definitions and the
   recommended training requirements for each type of LSO are provided in Bioenvironmental
   Engineers Guide for Lasers and Optical Radiation. (T-0)
3.3. Hazard Evaluations.
   3.3.1. The ILSO will conduct a hazard evaluation and establish controls prior to use or
   maintenance of all Class 3B or 4 FDA-Compliant Lasers or military specific lasers. This
   requirement shall include embedded Class 3B and Class 4 lasers if the use or maintenance
   could potentially expose personnel. Additionally, this requirement applies for the equivalent
   lasers and laser systems classified under prior ANSI, International Electrotechnical
   Commission (IEC), or FDA classification schemes. (T-0)
 20                                                          AFI48-139 30 SEPTEMBER 2014


   3.3.2. The most recent versions of the ANSI Z136 Series shall be adopted to determine
   classification of military specific lasers, calculate/identify beam and non-beam hazards,
   calculate nominal ocular hazard distances (NOHD), nominal skin hazard distance (NSHD),
   nominal hazard zones (NHZ), optical density (OD) and determine controls. The MPE values
   from ANSI Z136.1 shall not be exceeded unless part of an approved human-use protocol or
   medical procedure. (T-0)
   3.3.3. If an ILSO or ULSO suspects and validates that re-classification of a laser may result
   in a lower hazard class, then the classification and labeling should be updated IAW ANSI
   Z136 Series. (T-2)
   3.3.4. For safe use of lasers in health care facilities, consult with USAFSAM to conduct a
   hazard evaluation IAW ANSI Z136.3. (T-0)
   3.3.5. For visible lasers used in an outdoor environment, the hazard evaluation should
   include determining ranges associated with visual interference levels IAW MIL-HDBK-
   828A, MIL-HDBK-828B, and ANSI Z136.6. (T-0)
   3.3.6. For the safe use of lasers in research environments, consult with USAFSAM to
   conduct a hazard evaluation IAW ANSI Z136.8. (T-0)

   1-888-232-ESOH (3764), DSN 798-3764, or send emails to esoh.service.center@us.af.mil.
3.4. Laser Hazard Controls. The purpose of controls is to reduce the risk of exposure to the
skin and eyes even with the presence of PPE, and to prevent exposure to visible laser radiation at
levels that interfere with critical tasks. For purposes of this instruction, exposure is defined as
“unprotected exposure,” i.e. exposure without PPE. PPE shall be considered a tertiary control, to
be used in the event primary engineering or administrative controls fail or cannot be
implemented due to a negative mission impact. (T-0)
3.5. Medical Surveillance for Laser Users and Some Broadband Optical Sources.
   3.5.1. General. Any medical examination requirements are limited to personnel who
   routinely work in a laser environment with potential exposure to Class 3B or Class 4 lasers as
   either defined within the job description or on a greater than once a month basis. Users
   include operators, technicians, engineers, and maintenance/service personnel, etc., working
   with or around these lasers. Specific personnel working in a laser-operating environment,
   who may be exposed to laser emissions, include, but are not limited to, laboratory, aircrew,
   combat control teams, special operations forces and laser range personnel. Personnel who
   work with lasers that are embedded or encased limiting the potential exposure hazard to that
   of a lower class laser are not subject to a higher level of medical surveillance. Personnel who
   do not routinely operate in a laser environment may be considered incidental personnel not
   requiring examination.
   3.5.2. Medical Examination Requirements and Frequency for Lasers and Laser Systems.
   Refer to DOD 6055.05M, “Occupational Medical Examinations and Surveillance Manual,”
AFI48-139 30 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    21

   Lasers and Optical Radiation for guidance on topic.
   3.5.3. Documentation. Results of all examinations shall be recorded on an AF Form 600,
   Chronological Record of Medical Care, or equivalent, and filed in the individual’s medical
   record. Records should be retained for the individual’s working lifetime plus 30 years. (T-3)
   3.5.4. An Installation Occupational and Environmental Medicine Consultant in consultation
   with an optometrist shall determine medical examination requirements and frequency for
   users of optical radiation sources and shall reflect requirements in local regulations. (T-2)
3.6. Accidents/Incidents. Any accident/incident involving a suspected laser, broadband or
other optical radiation overexposure, visible laser illumination that negatively impacts mission
operations or a laser exposure causing personal injury to personnel and material damage to AF
equipment, systems or sensors shall be investigated and documented. If accidents/incidents
occur while personnel are on an expeditionary or contingency operation, an investigation should
occur as soon as possible. If an event should be the result of enemy/adversary activity, then
these personnel need to report the event through their chain of command. Refer to the
USAFSAM Laser Injury Guidebook, and/or the Bioenvironmental Engineers Guide for Lasers
and Optical Radiation for guidance on conducting an investigation and its documentation. (T-0)
3.7. Special Considerations.
   3.7.1. Medical and Dental Lasers. A medical and/or dental laser assessment may require
   additional expertise. USAFSAM/OE shall provide additional guidance if a health/medical
   physicist is not assigned to the installation. Guidance to assess medical lasers is provided in
   ANSI Z136.3, American National Standard for Safe Use of Lasers in Health Care Facilities
   and American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Report No. 73, Medical
   Lasers: Quality Control, Safety Standards, and Regulations. (T-2)

       Range Planning and Operations, AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures,
       ANSI Z136.6, American National Standard for Safe Use of Lasers Outdoors. Additional
       guidance can be found in Military Handbook 828B, Range Laser Safety.
       3.7.2.2. Range operations involving the use of lasers shall comply with AFI 13-212 and
       AFI 36-2226, Combat Arms Program, as applicable. (T-0)
       3.7.2.3. Lasers and high intensity lights may adversely impact military aircraft operations
       by temporarily flash-blinding or distracting aircrew during critical phases of flight.
       Guidance to control hazards associated with these operations on a range can be found in
       United States Department of Transportation, FAA Order 7400.2J, AC No: 70-1 and 70-2
       and ANSI Z136.6. The illumination of military aircraft from lasers or high intensity
       lights is a mandatory reportable event, and requires notification to the applicable
       MAJCOM, CCMD, ANG Operations Directorate or equivalent and also requires
       coordination with local and federal investigators. (T-0)
       3.7.2.4. Comply with policies and procedures in DoDI 3100.11 (O), Illumination of
       Objects in Space by Lasers, for laser devices potentially directed at targets above the

   brought into full compliance with 21 CFR 1040.10 & 1040.11 and the compliance paperwork
   filed with the FDA, or destroyed IAW with DODI 4160.21-M. (T-0)
3.9. Military Specific Lasers.
   3.9.1. Military specific lasers may be exempt from 21 CFR, Part 1040.10, and Part 1040.11
   requirements, and lack certain safety controls if necessary. It is therefore critical that users of
   these systems understand the hazards of the devices they are using and the alternate control
   measures approved by the AF LSSRB.
       3.9.1.1. Military specific lasers shall adhere to approved user OIs, TTPs, SOPs, and
       CONOPs/CONEMPs. (T-2)
       3.9.1.2. Military specific lasers shall only be used by individuals who are trained in the
       safe use of the device. (T-2)
       3.9.1.3. Targets shall be positively identified and situational awareness maintained
       during military specific laser operations and training to avoid unintended exposures to
       personnel. (T-2)
       3.9.1.4. LEP, appropriate for the military specific lasers, shall be worn IAW the AF
       LSSRB approval letter. (T-2)

Terms
Critical Zone—Volume of airspace where visual interference by a visible laser beam would
compromise safety due to interruption of necessary performance of critical tasks.
Directed Energy Weapon—A weapon system using directed energy primarily as a direct means
to deny, disrupt, degrade (damage), or destroy enemy equipment, facilities, or personnel. Note
that this differs slightly from the Joint definition by including deny and disrupt in order to cover
additional systems and capabilities.
Glare—Obscuration of an object in a person’s field of vision due to a bright light source located
near the same line of sight.
High Energy Laser—For this instruction, a laser that have output power greater than 1 kilowatt
(kW) for longer than a second or output energy greater than 1 kilojoule (kJ) per pulse.
Laser—An acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Any device
that can be made to produce or amplify electromagnetic radiation in the x-ray, UV, visible, and
infrared or other portions of the spectrum by the process of controlled stimulated emission of
photons.
Laser Free Zone—A designated area or volume of airspace where any extraneous visible
optical radiation could interfere with safety.
AFI48-139 30 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    33


Laser Safety Officer—An individual designated in writing whom is responsible for
implementing a laser safety program and enforcing control of laser hazards within their area of
responsibility.
Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE)—The level of laser radiation to which a person may
be exposed without hazardous effect or adverse biological changes in the eye or skin.
Military Specific Lasers—Lasers designed for actual combat, combat training operations, or
classified in the interest of national security. Exempted from FDA requirements of 21 CFR,
Parts 1040.10 and 1040.11.
Nominal Hazard Zone (NHZ)—The space in which laser radiation during operations exceeds
the applicable MPE including direct beam and reflected beams. Personnel within this zone shall
be provided PPE (e.g., LEP) and training for its use.
Nominal Ocular Hazard Distance (NOHD)—The distance from the output aperture along
beam propagation beyond which irradiance or radiant exposure is not expected to exceed the
appropriate MPE for unobstructed viewing by the human eye. The NOHD may increase with the
use of aided viewing.
Nominal Skin Hazard Distance (NSHD)—The distance from the output aperture along beam
propagation beyond which irradiance or radiant exposure is not expected to exceed the
appropriate MPE for unobstructed exposure to the skin.
Shall—The word shall is to be understood as mandatory.
Should—The word should is to be understood as advisory.
Sensitive Zone—All areas outside the critical zone(s) that flight or range operations have
identified as needing protection due to high visual workload. The sensitive zone may or may not
be contiguous or concentric with a critical zone.
Threshold Limit Value (TLV®)—For visible, near-infrared, and UV radiation, TLVs®
represent conditions under which it is believed that nearly all workers may be exposed without
adverse health effects. Values should be used only as guides in the control of exposures and
should not be regarded as fine lines between safe and dangerous levels
Visual Interference Level—A visible laser beam, with irradiance less than the MPE can
produce a visual response that interferes with the safe performance of sensitive or critical tasks
by aircrews or other personnel. This level varies in accordance with the particular zone the laser
is operating in and where it is directed. Zones include laser-free, critical and sensitive.
