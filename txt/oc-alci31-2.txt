   This book will remain with the aircraft during Pre & Post Dock and be placed in the forms
   can for the aircraft. During in-dock maintenance, the assigned aircraft logistics support
   (ALS) will maintain the book. When MOD/maintenance is complete and the aircraft is
   returned to the 552 ACW, the sign in log and SF form 702 will be delivered to the Aircraft
   Records Unit. This book will contain, as a minimum:
       2.9.4.1. The instructions for employees who maintain security.
       2.9.4.2. Instructions for locking and unlocking the aircraft
       2.9.4.3. Record of personnel assigned as aircraft custodians.

     2.9.4.4. Record of personnel authorized to remove classified equipment.
     2.9.4.5. Entry Authorization List (EAL).
 2.9.5. While on the flight line, the E-3 Aircraft, with the 40/45 mod and software loaded,
 will be cordoned off by means of cones and ropes. An entry control point will be established
 and only authorized personnel will be allowed access. Pre/Post Dock personnel will assume
 security of the aircraft while working on it and ensure no unauthorized personnel enter the
 cordoned off area.
 2.9.6. Upon completion of daily maintenance, the aircraft will be locked using the
 procedures in attachment 6 and Process Order 76 AMXG 12-03. When leaving the aircraft,
 notify the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) of the status of the aircraft to include:
 location, time it was locked and who locked the aircraft. When returning to the aircraft for
 further maintenance, notify the MOC. Give the time that the aircraft was unlocked and who
 unlocked it. 566 AMXS maintenance will assume security while on the aircraft and annotate
 on the SF 702, see attachment 8.
 2.9.7. The 566 AMXS Chief of Scheduling and Pre/Post Dock schedulers (ALS) will
 maintain the locks for the aircraft.
     2.9.7.1. Keys and combinations shall be retained separately from other keys and
     combinations. They shall only be accessible to those individuals whose official duties
     require access to them. A current roster of personnel who are authorized for key access
     shall be retained and kept from public view.
     2.9.7.2. The number of keys and combinations issued shall be held to the absolute
     minimum. Master keying and keying alike of locks and the use of a master key system is
     prohibited.
     2.9.7.3. If the keys or combination are lost or stolen, the affected locks or lock cores
     shall be replaced immediately, as appropriate.
 2.9.8. When Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex (OC-ALC) maintenance work
 operations are finalized and aircraft is ready to be moved to the Air Control Wing (ACW)
 restricted area, the ALS or Production Foreman in charge will notify the 552nd Air Control
 Wing Maintenance Group Quality Assurance Division (552nd ACW/MXGQ). The
 Scheduling Execution Unit will release responsibility of the aircraft upon the arrival of 552nd
 Squadron Personnel.
 2.9.9. While a 40/45 Modified E-3 is in Services for Strip/Paint, it will be locked by the Post
 Dock Personnel after being towed into the hanger and will remain locked throughout the
 process. Should the need arise to unlock the aircraft during the Strip/Paint process, Post
 Dock Personnel or properly cleared personnel will monitor the process and provide escort if
 required. Once the required maintenance is complete the aircraft will be relocked.

                    TEMPORARY CONTROLLED AREA 17 BADGE

A2.1. The temporary CA 17 badge (TCA17B): is utilized for granting unescorted entry into
CA 17 only for short periods of time. The use of this badge is to allow personnel unescorted
access to CA 17. The TCA17B is not to be used for personnel who have been issued a CA
badge, AF Form 1199C, with CA 17 authorization. Individuals granted the use of the temporary
CA 17 badges are not authorized to escort individuals into and around controlled area 17. NOTE:
Do not use a temporary badge as a 1-day substitute for lost or forgotten badges. The TCA17B
will not be used as a temporary badge for someone who forgot or lost their CA 17 badge.
A2.2. Temporary Controlled Area 17 Badges
   A2.2.1. TCA17B is an accountable item and will be maintained by each OC-ALC Group
   designee in secure storage when not in use. Personnel issuing TCA17B will use a Sign
   Out/Sign In Log to issue and receive the badge. (See attachment 3 EAL sample form). The
   log will be secured the same as the TCA17Bs.
       A2.2.1.1. The responsible representatives will inventory TCA17Bs monthly. Each
       October and April, to ensure accountability and conformity, the responsible OC-ALC
       Group representative will provide a semi-annual inventory to the 76 AMXG Group
       Security Manager not later than the last working day of the inventory month. The
       responsible OC-ALC Group Commander must endorse the semiannual inventory report.
       In addition, annual cyclical audits may be conducted by 76 AMXG Group Security
       Manager.
A2.3. Issuing of TCA17B
   A2.3.1. The individual issuing the TCA17B will require the requestor to present a current
   Common Access Card, or other appropriate photo ID (military, etc.), prior to allowing the
   individual to sign for the TCA17B. The individual must be present to sign for the TCA17B;
   individuals are not permitted to sign for another person’s badge.
       A2.3.1.1. Individuals issued TCA17B will be required to take TSS course
       MTEMAS0100130BR Controlled / Restricted area training. As a last resort of training,
       the employee will need to read and sign the Initial Controlled Training (attachment 4)
       prior to being issued the badge. If the (attachment 4) training is used, a copy of the
       signed document must be retained for 1 year.
       A2.3.1.2. The person authorized to issue the TCA17B will instruct the individual signing
       for the TCA17B that upon completion of the Maintenance University (MXU) training
       they are responsible to return the TCA17B to the issuing Group or Staff Office
       immediately or if at the end of the duty day, on the next normal duty day.
A2.4. Wearing of TCA17B
   A2.4.1. The individual who is issued a TCA17B will also carry their Common Access Card
   or other appropriate photo ID with them while in CA 17, for identification verification.
   TCA17B must be worn at all times on the front side of the person between the shoulders and
   waist and will not be displayed when outside of CA 17, specifically when off-base.
 20                                                        OC-ALCI31-2 15 JANUARY 2014


A2.5. Reporting Missing, Lost or Damaged TCA17B badge:
   A2.5.1. Missing, stolen or lost TCA17B must be reported immediately to the issuing
   Group/Staff Office. For a lost or stolen TCA17B the individual will prepare a letter to the
   issuing Group/Staff Office establishing all facts involved in the loss; answering questions of
   who, what, why, when, where and how. The Group/Staff Office from which the lost
   TCA17B was issued, will notify 76 AMXG Group Security Manager and provide a copy of
   the letter surrounding the circumstances.
A2.6. Mass TCA17B reissue:
   A2.6.1. If more than 10% of the TCA17B are lost during a 12 month period, the TCA17B is
   considered compromised. A mass re-issue of TCA17B will be required for the Group/Staff
   Office issuing the TCA17B. If a mass reissue is required, 76 AMXG Group Security
   Manager will issue cards with a new number sequence and color.

      identification. It must be verified. In addition, the badge itself is not adequate authority for
      personnel to enter a CA. Entrance must be required in the performance of official duties. To
      verify identity, check the person’s identification against other forms of ID (such as the CAC
      Identification Card). Personnel must be informed that they must:

         be in the area cannot be verified.
      A4.1.4. Report the loss or misuse of a badge as soon as possible to the security forces, unit
      CAM, and organization’s Security Manager. The unit Commander must make sure the
      incident is investigated promptly.
