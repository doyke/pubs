establishes policy and assigns responsibility for the operations group (OG), maintenance group
(MXG), and mission support group (MSG) commanders to develop and execute aircraft flying
and maintenance programs. This instruction prescribes policies and procedures governing
aerospace equipment maintenance management for Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). This
instruction applies to AFRC unit equipped (UE), Active Associate, and Air Reserve Component
Associates when AFRC is the lead organization. This supplement does not apply to AFRC
Classic Associate maintenance units or the Air National Guard (ANG). It applies to these
organizations and personnel that maintain aircraft, aircraft systems, equipment, support
equipment, and components regardless of Air Force Specialty Code. It provides a broad
management framework for the Group Commanders to adjust procedures to compensate for
mission, facility, and geographic differences of the units. The reporting requirements in this
publication (unless otherwise specified) are exempt from licensing in accordance with (IAW)

                                            Chapter 1

                       GENERAL RESPONSIBILITY AND POLICY

1.1. Responsibilities. Commanders at all levels are responsible for compliance with this
instruction.
1.2. Policy. This instruction provides procedures and audit methods for units to develop their
flying and maintenance scheduling program and analyze its effectiveness. It is intended to be a
local tool for operations and maintenance activities to use in support of their programs.
Reviewing reasons for deviating from the flying and maintenance schedule allows wing
commanders (WG/CC) and staff to evaluate unit flying program and scheduling procedures.
1.3. Objectives. This instruction allows units the flexibility to meet mission requirements
through efficient flying and maintenance scheduling. It also provides information used by
analysts to assess unit performance and capability. Scheduling evaluation procedures provides an
avenue to identify problems in flying and maintenance schedules. The primary purpose of
scheduling assessment is to evaluate the effectiveness of the unit's flying program in support of
combat capability. Maintenance analysis process is used to track, analyze and present
information to help senior leadership assess the health of the units' weapon systems and
equipment.
1.4. Applicability. This publication is applicable to all AFRC units possessing or supporting
AFRC aircraft, including contractor maintained aircraft.
1.5. Reporting Requirements. Units will use IMDS/G081 reporting procedures. This includes
contractor-maintained, wing assigned aircraft. In the event that the contractor is not obligated to
utilize the MIS, the MXG commander is responsible to ensure all reporting procedures are
followed. MAF units deployed to a combatant command using IMDS will continue to use G081
for tracking and scheduling deployed assets or equipment.
1.6. Waivers. Waiver authority for this publication rests with HQ AFRC/A4M. AFRC waiver
requests are submitted by the WG/CC. See Attachment 2, Waiver/Change Request Format.
1.7. Standardization. Wings will develop a wing instruction standardizing scheduling practices
for the wing and each assigned mission design series (MDS). Minimum topics will include:
standardized flying windows, specific surge rules, quiet hour policies, cross country take-offs
and returns, minimum turn times, crew ready times, etc. Wing instructions will include local
schedule publishing and input deadlines along with any other wing unique requirements.
1.8. Alert Aircraft. Aircraft Maintenance Unit (AMU) officer in charge (OIC) and
Noncommissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC) will ensure aircraft entering or coming off alert
are managed to avoid Hangar Queen Candidacy as a result of extended idle alert periods.
Maintenance Data Systems Analysis (MDSA) will review sortie performance and reliability
trends of aircraft coming off alert/immediate response (IR) and present performance analysis to
affected AMU maintenance operations and MOF maintenance operations.

              FLYING AND MAINTENANCE SCHEDULING PROCEDURES

2.1. Flying and Maintenance Planning Cycle. The objective of the flying and maintenance
planning cycle is to execute the wing flying hour program (FHP) consistent with operational
requirements (AFI 11-102, Flying Hour Program Management) and maintenance capabilities
(AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management). For the purpose of developing
Firstlook/Annual Plan AFRC template must be used and calculations must be based primarily on
historical data.
2.2. First look Requirements (CAF).
     2.2.1. Airframe Capability and Scheduling. To ensure accurate projection of operations and
     maintenance capacity, units will compute airframe capabilities using only the number of
     Primary Aircraft Authorized (PAA). Operational and training schedules will be based on the
     capability of PAA aircraft to execute the schedule. Do not include traditional reservists in the
     personnel capability computation.
        2.2.1.1. NLT 31 March, Maintenance Management Analysis (MMA) will provide PS&D
        with airframe, personnel and facility capability studies in a monthly format.
            2.2.1.1.1. PS&D will forward copies of the facility, personnel and airframe capability
            studies to OPS scheduling and maintenance supervision NLT 10 April.
        2.2.1.2. Operations Squadron will furnish the O&M days and additional requirements
        listed in AFI 21-101 paragraphs 7.4.2 – 7.4.2.3., by month, for the entire fiscal year, NLT
        25 April.
        2.2.1.3. The maintenance squadron will furnish the dock capability by month, for the
        entire fiscal year, using the formula provided in AFI21-101 paragraph 7.4.2.4., NLT 25
        April.
        2.2.1.4. PS&D and OSS Current Operations will review and consolidate the information
        into one package for presentation to the MXG and OG commanders NLT 25 May. The
        package should include the projected operational requirements and an assessment of
        maintenance’s ability to support them.
            2.2.1.4.1. Present the complete package to the wing commander after it has been
            approved by both the OG and MXG commanders.
2.3. AFRC Baseline Allocation Message. The Baseline Allocation message will become the
contract between AFRC and the unit. AFRC A3 will forward the allocation message to the unit
each year. The message will be the basis for the unit’s annual flying and maintenance planning
process. See AFI 21-101 paragraphs 7.5. thru 7.5.2.7.
     2.3.1. CAF MMA will validate the capability studies that were completed during ―First
     look‖.
     2.3.2. MAF MMA will initiate capability studies NLT 1 Jun.
     2.3.3. OS/OSS and PS&D provide the planning factors listed in AFI 21-101 paragraphs
     7.5.1.1. thru 7.5.1.7. NLT 10 days after receipt of the baseline allocation message.
AFRCI21-165 7 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                      7


   2.3.4. In conjunction with the third weekly scheduling meeting of the month prior to the
   beginning of the fiscal year, PS&D and OSS will chair an annual planning meeting with all
   required agencies. Agencies will include but are not limited to AMXS, MXS, MUNS, and
   MSG (i.e. Fuels servicing).
   2.3.5. Once Wing/CC approves the plan, the OG and MXG will provide a coordinated final
   flying hour program message to AFRC/A3T/A4M prior to the beginning of the fiscal year.
2.4. Annual Maintenance Planning Capability Factors.
   2.4.1. Airframe capability Airframe capability is used when determining the unit’s capability
   to support the operational flying requirement for a specified month, quarter, or fiscal year. It
   is an assessment of various maintenance and operations factors based on historical data and
   assumptions. Airframe capability computations are a compilation of factors that determine if
   a unit’s available aircraft can support any type of requirement in peacetime and wartime.
   When all factors are considered, the assessment is developed in terms of airframe capability
   forecast. This is a tool for commanders to assess their own peacetime or wartime capability.
   See Attachment 5 for formulas and AFRC Airframe Capability Model.
      2.4.1.1. Maintenance factors: are defined as all maintenance-related activities that can
      affect the availability of aircraft for sortie generation. These maintenance factors reduce
      airframe availability. If one aircraft is provided as a maintenance trainer, then that’s one
      aircraft less for flying. Aircraft wash and scheduled maintenance actions are also to be
      included. These factors will be assigned a numerical value for each unit.
      2.4.1.2. Sortie generation factors: Sortie generation factors include maintenance factors
      in addition to the following:
          2.4.1.2.1. Number of operations and maintenance days per year.
          2.4.1.2.2. Total number of possessed aircraft.
          2.4.1.2.3. Historical mission capability (MC) rate (percent).
          2.4.1.2.4. Turn factor (hours).
          2.4.1.2.5. Average sortie duration (hours).
          2.4.1.2.6. Flying envelope (hours).
          2.4.1.2.7. Crew preflight time (hours).
          2.4.1.2.8. Maintenance prep time (hours).
          2.4.1.2.9. Attrition rate (percentage).
   2.4.2. Personnel capability rate (Leading). Personnel capability is measured in terms of
   maintenance personnel(MP) per operational unit or MP/U. MP/U is used to measure the
   total number of direct maintenance personnel needed for each specified operational unit to
   perform direct on-equipment and off-equipment maintenance. This measurement is used in
   developing manpower projections to support specified operating and maintenance concepts.
   Personnel capability can be expressed in several ways, depending on unit requirements.
   Regardless of specific unit requirements, personnel capability rate is expressed as a ratio,
   with factors such as flying hours, sorties, workcenter, manhours, crew, inspections, hourly
 8                                                            AFRCI21-165 7 FEBRUARY 2011


     postflight (HPO), periodic inspections (PE), and number of personnel. See Attachment 5 for
     formulas.
     2.4.3. Facility capability. The term facility refers to space requirements. For example, for a
     dock to be considered a complete operational unit, it must include the facility itself plus the
     necessary personnel. Facility capability is computed in order to determine how many flying
     hours or sorties inspection docks can support. Facility capability rates are computed for each
     type of aircraft. An aircraft is placed in a dock where a dock crew makes an inspection. The
     dock crew is composed of specialists. Facility capability may be expressed in docks and
     crews. Even though only one dock may be required, it may consist of three crews or shifts.
     Prior to determining the number of flying hours or sorties facilities can support, the following
     information must be determined: inspection cycle, average sortie length, WDM, in-dock
     time, and number of docks available. See attachment 5 for formulas. Note: The following
     guidance is a duplication of AMCI 10-202 V6. It has been placed here to provide consistency
     and flow for personnel in the process of determining proper rates for flying hour
     computations and factors.
     2.4.4. Commitment Rate: (MAF) PS&D will calculate and provide average aircraft
     availability per month.
        2.4.4.1. Commitment Level Deviations. Commitment rate is generally defined as the
        number of aircraft tasked on the flying schedule compared to the number of possessed
        aircraft.
            2.4.4.1.1. The commitment rate metrics are used for three purposes, daily execution,
            long range planning management, and quantifying past performance.
            2.4.4.1.2. Daily Execution Management: Commitment rate is used to identify
            delayed missions due to over-commitment, which saturates a unit’s ability to generate
            aircraft.
                2.4.4.1.2.1. Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) commitment rate measures
                how many TACC Taskable aircraft are in use or within their allocated spot time
                prior to take off for delay accountability purposes only. AMC standard spot time
                is the maintenance release time prior to takeoff. The C2 unit will determine and
                report the commitment level at spot time by using the following formula:

Table 2.1. Execution Commitment Rate Formula.
                          Execution Commitment Rate Formula
     TACC Commitment Rate=TACC Tasked Aircraft ÷TACC Taskable Aircraft (AATS) X 100

                                 C-17           5 hours
AFRCI21-165 7 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                  9


                           C-141          5 Hours

                           C-130          4 Hours

                          KC-135          4 Hours

                           KC-10         12 Hours

           2.4.4.1.2.2. If mission commitment level at spot time exceeds 100% of the TACC
           taskable aircraft or crews, these missions become eligible for a 505 or 516
           deviation code (regardless of commitment rate at scheduled takeoff time). Units
           will identify potential delays at spot time with an advisory message and TACC
           will approve all 505 or 516 deviation codes. Over commitment at spot time does
           not alleviate the generation of aircraft, it identifies the potential for a delay to
           occur. The 505 code is used when the unit is over committed because
           aircraft/crews have not returned home as scheduled. The 516 deviation code is
           used when the unit is over tasked due to HHQ scheduling. These codes can only
           be used for TACC executable missions and only for the number of missions
           exceeding the TACC taskable allocation, not for every deviation encountered, i.e.,
           one aircraft over committed, three deviations occur, only one mission should be
           coded with the 505 or 516 deviation code. Commitment level percentage and a
           full explanation of the reason a unit is overcommitted or over tasked will be
           entered in the deviation remarks field of the deviation message. The 516 delay
           time will be determined from the difference between initial TACC mission
           departure time and Unit determined aircraft/aircrew availability mission departure
           time. Once the Unit establishes a mission departure time further delay results in a
           secondary code and delay time from the unit established departure time.
           Commitment level percentage and secondary deviation code remarks will be
           entered in the deviation remarks field of the deviation message.
           2.4.4.1.2.3. If the unit approved a crew enhancement deviation on a
           mission/aircraft that could have been utilized, preventing an over committed
           situation, a 500-series code will not be used.
           2.4.4.1.2.4. Wing Current Operations will provide the unit C2 agency with AATS
           information or C2 controllers may retrieve ATTS via the following web site:
           https://amclg.scott.af.mil. Select the AATS button, then the Execution Week
           Report. Find the applicable MDS and unit. The TACC taskable aircraft will be
           found in the TACC allocation column.
        2.4.4.1.3. Long-range planning management: Long-range planning of capability is
        the most effective use of commitment rate and is an integral part of the
        Aircrew/Aircraft Tasking System (AATS).
           2.4.4.1.3.1. Long-range AATS planning uses the commitment rate listed in Table
           6.22. to calculate the daily number of TACC taskable aircraft and is calculated by
           HQ AMC/A33 one time prior to the beginning of execution period using the
 10                                                        AFRCI21-165 7 FEBRUARY 2011


               following formula:

Table 2.3. AATS Formula.
                                           AATS Formula
                                          TACC Taskable =
        [(Possessed – Deployed) * (Commitment Rate)] – Adjustments – Training Allocation
      NOTE: Adjustments are management inputs to the AATS process to properly account
      for all AMC aircraft and all adjustments are clearly defined in the AATS process. The
      number of authorized allocated trainers is set by AMC/A33 for each unit and provided to
      the units via the AATS process.

            2.4.4.1.4. Quantifying Past Performance: Overall commitment rate measures the total
            impact of all unit taskings to include TACC missions/alerts/spares, deployments, and
            local training (including maintenance and ground trainers). Unit commanders should
            monitor overall commitment rate to ensure that it does not exceed the planning
            factors listed in Table 2.5 Exceeding overall commitment thresholds while staying
            below the TACC commitment threshold of 100% will not result in authorized use of
            the over commitment deviation codes. However, operating above the planned overall
            commitment threshold will have negative long-term effects on aircraft fleet health.
            Overall commitment rate is calculated using the following formula:

Table 2.4. Overall Commitment Level Formula.
                                Overall Commitment Level Formula
       (Local Trainers + AATS Adjustments + TACC Missions/Alerts/Spares (not deployed)) ÷
                 Possessed Aircraft (PI ―CA‖) - Deployed (Chop’d & Staged) X 100

       NOTE: Possessed aircraft are based on the Possession Identifier (PI) codes ―IF‖ for C-
       141, C-17, and C-5; and ―CA‖ for C-130, KC-10 and KC-135. PI codes are listed in AFI
       33-110, Data Administration Program, and rules for reporting are in AFI 21-103,
       Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting.

            2.4.4.1.5. During contingencies or increased operations, and at the direction of
            AMC/CV, schedulers will use the contingency commitment rates in Table 2.5 for
            commitment level monitoring. AMC/A33 calculates the contingency commitment
            rate, using the AATS formula, and provides schedulers the new number of taskable
            aircraft.

Table 2.5. AMC overall planning commitment levels.

          2.4.4.1.6. As directed by AMC/CC/CV, AMC may enter a max surge operation
          where commitment levels and thresholds no longer apply. During this period use of
          the ―505/516‖ deviation codes is not authorized.
          2.4.4.1.7. If TACC tasks an outbound mission on a returning aircraft and does not
          allow allotted spot time prior to take off, use deviation code 517. All other deviations
          will be recorded for the underlying cause of the deviation. The 517 deviation code is
          only authorized during AMC/CC/CC maximum surge operations.
          2.4.4.1.8. Other. Use 599 when there is no OTHER deviation code that describes the
          deviation.
          2.4.4.1.9. (CAF Only) MXG and OG should develop and agree on a local
          commitment rate to help with operational capability and fleet health.
2.5. Quarterly Scheduling:
   2.5.1. Complete the quarterly plan in accordance with AFI 21-101, paragraphs 7.6. thru
   7.6.2.
   2.5.2. Operations Squadron provides the operational requirements to maintenance
   supervision and PS&D in conjunction with the first weekly scheduling meeting of the month
   prior to the beginning of the quarter.
2.6. Monthly Scheduling:
   2.6.1. Complete the monthly plan in accordance with AFI 21-101, paragraphs 7.7. thru
   7.7.5.13.7.
2.7. Weekly Scheduling:
   2.7.1. Complete the weekly schedule in accordance with AFI 21-101, paragraphs 7.8 thru
   7.8.3.10.2.
   2.7.2. All agencies will submit inputs to the weekly schedule no later than two days prior to
   the weekly scheduling meeting. Establish local procedures to identify agencies and the
   product they are responsible for providing.
   2.7.3. The flying schedule and job control numbers will be loaded in the IMDS/G081 by
   1600L on Fridays. (Exception: on UTA weekends, the flying schedule and maintenance job
   control numbers may be loaded by 1600L on Sunday). G081 units will use program ID 9074
   to load the flying schedule.
2.8. Changes to the Weekly Schedule:
   2.8.1. All changes to the weekly schedule require an AF Form 2407 or the electronic
   equivalent with the exception of a change of aircrew names, ranges, airspace, changes that
   occur after the first crew ready time. Sortie additions, aircraft additions and flying window
   expansion that occur after first crew ready time will be coordinated with affected agencies
   via radio or telephone.
2.9. AF Form 2407 Procedures.
12                                                        AFRCI21-165 7 FEBRUARY 2011


  2.9.1. The agency requesting the change will initiate/coordinate an AF Form 2407 or the
  electronic equivalent. The AF Form 2407 will clearly state the required change and the
  specific reason for each change. Changes must be coordinated with the following agencies at
  a minimum. Production Superintendent, MXS Maintenance Operations, Operations
  Squadron, Operations Officer, Operations Group, Munitions Control (if applicable),
  Maintenance Group, MOC, PS&D, MDSA, POL and MSL).
     2.9.1.1. Tail Number Swaps. Tail number swaps will be used to the maximum extent
     possible to prevent reconfiguration and unnecessary expenditure of work hours when the
     primary aircraft is not mission-capable by its scheduled take-off time. Tail swaps made
     prior to crew show must be recorded on an AF Form 2407 or electronic equivalent.
     2.9.1.2. Configuration. Configuration changes including those made after the production
     meeting the day prior/before crew change on the scheduled sortie date must be
     coordinated via AF Form 2407 or electronic equivalent.
  2.9.2. After coordination, a copy of the AF Form 2407 is filed in the MOC and disposed of
  IAW the Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS). The MOC will
  ensure MDSA receives all AF Form 2407s for deviation accounting.
  2.9.3. Pen-and-Ink Changes Pen-and-ink changes made to next week’s schedule, and
  coordinated by 1600 hours Friday are authorized, are non-reportable, and become part of the
  printed weekly flying schedule. An AF Form 2407 or electronic equivalent is required and
  must be titled ―Pen and Ink‖.
     2.9.3.1. During a scheduled UTA Weekend, units are allowed to accomplish pen-and-ink
     changes by 1600 hours on Sunday.
  2.9.4. AF Form 2407 Approval Authority. All AF Form 2407 Pen and Ink changes that add
  Sorties or increase the flying window will be approved by both the OG and MXG
  Commander or their designated representative. All other AF Form 2407 changes will be
  approved by the affected Squadron Commander or their designated representative. Electronic
  signature and electronic coordination is acceptable. For electronic coordination, all agencies
  must be listed and receipt confirmed by e-filing the receipts in an email organizational box.
  (An organizational box will allow shared access and prevent individual email file creation).
  The agency coordinating the change will maintain receipt confirmations.

                                        DEVIATIONS

3.1. Flying Scheduling Effectiveness Deviations. A deviation is defined as departure from the
weekly printed flying schedule. Multiple deviations will NOT be recorded against a single line
entry. See Attachment 4 for computing rates for Flying Schedule Effectiveness.
   3.1.1. Addition. An addition (Add) is defined as a sortie/home-station launch flown that was
   not on the printed schedule. Once an added sortie/home-station launch is scheduled, it is not
   subject to any other deviations. NOTE: FCF and OCF whose primary purpose is to perform
   maintenance checks are not additions. FCF and OCF sorties will be recorded ―flown as
   scheduled.‖
       3.1.1.1. Higher Headquarters Addition (HQx Add) are additions resulting from a HHQ’s
       tasking, to include NAF, MAJCOM, or gaining command directed additions.
       3.1.1.2. Maintenance Addition (MTx Add) are additions resulting in the generation of an
       aircraft to recover another aircraft off-station (i.e. MRT) with an unscheduled
       maintenance discrepancy.
       3.1.1.3. Operations Addition (OPx Add) are additions resulting from operations/aircrew
       actions, including aircrew training, mission changes, and/or any other operations specific
       requirements.
       3.1.1.4. Weather Addition (WXx Add) are additional sorties added to the flying schedule
       to make up for weather losses. Sorties will be added to the schedule when the planned
       weather attrition for the month, prorated daily, has been exceeded for that month. The
       number of sorties added will not exceed the difference between the planned weather
       attrition and actual weather losses. (Example: Planned weather attrition for the month
       equals 30 sorties. On the 10th O&M day of the month (of 20), a unit’s weather losses are
       already 30 sorties. The unit may add 15 sorties (weather adds). The maintenance schedule
       and the ability of maintenance to support the additional requirements must be carefully
       considered before adding sorties. Weather adds even within planned prorated attrition
       limits, are recorded as schedule deviations. Under no circumstances will the number of
       sorties added for weather exceed the number of expected weather losses for the month.
       3.1.1.5. Other Addition (OTx Add) are additions to flying schedule for any reason other
       than stated in paragraphs 3.1.1.1 through 3.1.1.4.
   3.1.2. Cancellation. A cancellation is defined as an aircraft or sortie removed from the
   printed flying schedule for any reason (before crew show).
       3.1.2.1. Air Traffic Control Cancellation (ATC CX) are cancellations resulting from air
       traffic control problems (e.g., flight clearance delays, tower communication failure, or
       runway closure.).
       3.1.2.2. Higher Headquarters Cancellation (HQ CX) are cancellations resulting from a
       HHQ’s tasking, to include NAF, AFRC, or gaining command.
14                                                         AFRCI21-165 7 FEBRUARY 2011


     3.1.2.3. Maintenance Cancellation (MT CX) are cancellations resulting from aircraft
     discrepancies, unscheduled maintenance, and/or any other maintenance consideration(s)
     prior to crew show at the aircraft (C-5 aircraft prior to engine start).
     3.1.2.4. Operations Cancellation (OP CX) are cancellations resulting from
     operations/aircrew actions, including crew illness or substitutions, mission changes,
     and/or any other operations specific requirements.
     3.1.2.5. Supply Cancellation (SU CX) are cancellation resulting from a Partially Mission
     Capable Supply (PMCS), Not Mission Capable Supply (NMCS) condition, late supply or
     Petroleum Oil Lubricant (POL) delivery.
     3.1.2.6. Sympathy Cancellation (SY CX) are cancellations resulting when subsequent
     aircraft are cancelled, due to a cancellation or abort of another aircraft in a flight of two
     or more.
     3.1.2.7. Weather Cancel (WX CX) are cancellations caused by adverse weather
     conditions.
     3.1.2.8. Other Cancellation (OT CX) are cancellation to flying schedule for any reason
     other than stated in paragraphs 3.1.2.1 through 3.12.7.
  3.1.3. Early Take-Off deviations are recorded for any sortie/launch on the weekly flying
  schedule that takes off more than 30 minutes before the scheduled take-off time.
     3.1.3.1. Air Traffic Control Early Take-Off (ATC Early) result from air traffic control
     problems (for example, expected flight clearance delays, expected tower communication
     problems, or forecasted runway closure).
     3.1.3.2. Higher Headquarters Early Take-Off (HQ Early) result from a HHQ’s tasking, to
     include NAF, MAJCOM, or gaining command.
     3.1.3.3. Operations Early Take-Off (OP Early) result from operations/aircrew actions
     including substitution, mission changes, and/or any other operations specific
     requirements.
     3.1.3.4. Weather Early Take-Off (WX Early): Early take-off due to adverse weather
     conditions forecasted.
     3.1.3.5. Other Early Take-Off (OT Early): Early take-off for any reason other than stated
     in paragraphs 3.1.3.1. through 3.1.3.4.
  3.1.4. Late Take-Off is defined as any sortie/launch on the weekly flying schedule that takes
  off more than 15 minutes after the scheduled take-off time. If the printed tail number is a
  ground abort and replaced with a scheduled spare that takes off late, only record the late take-
  off against Flying Schedule Effectiveness (FSE).
     3.1.4.1. Air Traffic Control Late Take-Off (ATC Late) result from air traffic control
     problems (for example, flight clearance delays, tower communication problems, or
     runway closure).
     3.1.4.2. Higher Headquarters Late Take-Off (HQ Late) result from a HHQ tasking to
     include NAF, major command, or gaining command.
AFRCI21-165 7 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                     15


       3.1.4.3. Maintenance Late Take-Off (MT Late) result from aircraft discrepancies,
       unscheduled maintenance, and/or any other maintenance consideration.
       3.1.4.4. Operations Late Take-Off (OP Late) result from operations/aircrew actions
       including substitution, mission changes, and/or any other operations specific
       requirements.
       3.1.4.5. Supply Late Take-Off (SU Late) result from a Partially Mission Capable Supply
       (PMCS), Not Mission Capable Supply (NMCS) condition, late supply or Petroleum Oil
       Lubricant (POL) delivery.
       3.1.4.6. Sympathy Late Take-Off (SY Late) result when the subsequent aircraft is late
       due to the cancellation, abort, or late take-off of the other aircraft in a flight of two or
       more aircraft.
       3.1.4.7. Weather Late Take-Off (WX Late) are the result of adverse weather conditions.
       3.1.4.8. Other Late Take-Off (OT Late) are the result of late take-offs for any reason
       other than stated in paragraphs 3.1.4.1 through 3.1.4.7
3.2. Air Deviations: Air deviations are events occurring after take-off. They are recorded but
are not included in FSE calculations. Ground deviations take precedence over air deviations
when only one deviation can be loaded in IMDS. Air deviations fall into the following
categories:
   3.2.1. Air Abort (AA). An air abort is an aircraft/sortie that cannot complete its mission for
   any reason. Air aborts are considered a sortie flown against the flying hour program when
   reporting total sorties flown, but may not be considered a successful sortie based on mission
   effectiveness. Air aborts will be coded to the agency or condition that caused the aborted
   mission.
   3.2.2. Air Abort, IFE (AI). An air aborted aircraft/sortie with a situation resulting in an in-
   flight emergency declared by the aircrew.
   3.2.3. Early Landing (EL). An early landing is an aircraft/sortie landing more than 30
   minutes before the scheduled landing time. Early Landing deviations are not used when
   computing FSE.
   3.2.4. IFE (FE). An aircraft/sortie with a situation resulting in an in-flight emergency
   declared by the aircrew after the mission is accomplished.
   3.2.5. Late Landing (LL). A late landing is an aircraft/sortie landing more than 15 minutes
   after the scheduled landing time. If the sortie originated on time, record any subsequent late
   take-off or cancellation against the agency that caused the late landing. If the extended sortie
   did not originate on time, record any subsequent sortie deviation against the agency that
   caused the original delay. Late landings are not included in FSE calculations.
3.3. Ground Aborts: A ground abort by itself is not a deviation from the flying schedule, but
may cause a deviation such as lost sortie or late take-off. A ground abort is an event after crew
show time preventing a ―crew ready‖ aircraft from becoming airborne. Ground aborts will be
recorded to the responsible agency or condition that caused the aircraft to abort. Ground aborts
are categorized as GAA, GAB, GAC, operations, HHQ, weather, sympathy, other, etc. For
maintenance ground aborts, use GAA, GAB, or GAC. For example, if an aircraft ground aborts
 16                                                           AFRCI21-165 7 FEBRUARY 2011


and the sortie is not replaced by a spare, the lost sortie is a deviation towards FSE. Ground aborts
on FCFs or OCFs will be recorded in IMDS, but not used when computing FSE.
   3.3.1. If a ground aborted aircraft is replaced by a spare, and the spare can meet the mission
   requirements, the original aircraft will be coded as a ―spare ground abort.‖ NOTE: This is not
   used in computing FSE.
   3.3.2. If the original aborted aircraft is launched on the original scheduled mission, but
   exceeds the 15-minute late take-off criteria, the sortie will be recorded as a late take-off.
   3.3.3. If the aircraft lands, takes fuel via the hot pits, incurs an NMC condition after
   completion of hot pit refueling (receptacle disconnected) and can no longer continue, a
   ground abort is recorded.
   3.3.4. If an aircraft ground aborts and is replaced by a spare and the spare ground aborts
   causing the sortie not to be flown, both ground aborts will be counted in the overall ground
   abort rate, the lost sortie will be considered cancelled and included as the deviation in FSE.
   The first ground abort would not be used in computing FSE.
3.4. Deviation Causes: Deviations will be assigned a primary cause. The operations officer and
the maintenance officer or their designate will monitor deviations to ensure they meet the criteria
in this instruction. When conflicts arise, leadership at the agencies will resolve them at the lowest
level. Deviations will be assigned one of the following causes:
   3.4.1. Maintenance (MT) deviations resulting from aircraft discrepancies, unscheduled
   maintenance, or for actions taken for maintenance consideration.
   3.4.2. Operations (OP) deviations resulting from operations/aircrew actions, mission changes
   causing an early/late take-off, or cancellation including substitution/aircrew illness (including
   short notice aircrew physical/mental disqualification), and over-stressing the aircraft. OP_ are
   also deviations resulting from unit controlled operations factors including those caused by
   mission/load planning, life support, intelligence, base operations, range scheduling, and
   passengers.
   3.4.3. Supply (SU) deviations resulting from a Partially Mission Capable Supply or Not
   Mission Capable Supply condition or for late Supply or POL delivery.
   3.4.4. Higher Headquarters (HHQ) deviations resulting from a higher headquarters tasking
   including closing of low level routes/ranges or external customer driven mission change.
   When an aircraft that was scheduled for a higher headquarters directed alert or off-base
   mission is replaced by a spare refer to paragraph 5.5.1. for unit options.
   3.4.5. Weather (WX) deviations resulting from weather conditions such as sorties canceled
   because of severe weather conditions. For example, if an aircraft taxied to the end of runway
   and the wing commander cancels all flying due to weather, the deviation is a weather abort.
   Sorties/Aircraft cancelled prior to crew show are weather cancels.
   3.4.6. Sympathy (SY) deviations occurring when a flight of two or more aircraft, under the
   command of a flight leader or instructor pilot are canceled, aborted, or late due to a
   cancellation, abort, or delay of one of the aircraft in the flight or a supporting flight. Flights
   engaged in Dissimilar Air Combat Tactics training that are delayed by the other flight will
   record the delay as sympathy. Sorties, which are to replace sympathy aborts or cancellations
   on the same day, will be recorded as sympathy additions. Sorties lost caused by the aircraft's
AFRCI21-165 7 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                   17


  scheduled mated tanker/receiver/mission event will be recorded as sympathy. Examples of
  mission events are: loss of release times, tanker support, Minimum Interval Take-Off causing
  take-off delay or cancellation, deviations caused by another unit’s or command’s support
  should be coded as SY deviations.
  3.4.7. Air Traffic Control (AT) are deviations resulting from air traffic control problems (for
  example flight clearance delays, tower communication failure, conflicting air traffic, runway
  change, or runway closure).
  3.4.8. Other (OT) deviations resulting from unusual circumstances not covered by other
  causes listed. OT may include:
     3.4.8.1. Malfunctions, failures, or necessary adjustments to equipment undergoing tests
     or evaluations associated with Operational Testing and Evaluation (OT&E),
     Development Testing and Evaluation (DT&E), or Initial Operational Testing and
     Evaluation (IOT&E).
     3.4.8.2. Unusual circumstances such as bird strikes, damage during air refueling, and
     unscheduled alert swap out.
     3.4.8.3. Equipment, non-AFRC are deviations caused by National Airborne Operations
     Center or Air Intelligence Agency or Air Force Material Command equipment, and other
     non-AFRC support and equipment.
  3.4.9. Exercise, Higher Headquarters (XEH) deviations result from higher headquarters
  directed exercises, including alarm/force protection conditions.
  3.4.10. Exercise, Local (XEL) deviations result from wing/unit directed exercises, including
  alarm/force protection conditions.

                MAINTENANCE SCHEDULING EFFECTIVENESS (MSE)

4.1. Maintenance Schedule Effectiveness Goal:
   4.1.1. AFRC goal for MSE is 95 percent.
4.2. Computations:
   4.2.1. Compute the aircraft MSE using scheduled maintenance events in the printed weekly
   schedule. The MIS will be used to determine whether or not the maintenance actions were
   completed on time. For credit, maintenance must be completed on the date that it is
   scheduled in the published flying and maintenance plan. Items scheduled over multiple days
   must be completed in the MIS by the last date indicated in the published plan.
   4.2.2. Units may revise or reprint their schedule without incurring deviations if they receive
   unscheduled tasking or unannounced exercise/real world contingency. Normal deviation
   reporting procedures will be followed once the revised or reprinted plan is finalized.

Table 4.1. MSE Deviations and Functions:
DEVIATION                       FUNCTION
Maintenance (MT)                Actions canceled because aircraft is added to the flying schedule,
                                lack of manpower, equipment or as a result of mismanagement.
Operations (OP)                 Actions canceled or not completed on time for operational
                                reasons or as a result of adding aircraft to the flying and
                                maintenance schedule to meet operations requirements. This also
                                includes maintenance events not completed due to operations
                                group actions. For example, Life Support Section not completing
                                scheduled maintenance as published in the flying and
                                maintenance schedule.
Higher headquarters (HHQ)       Actions canceled or not completed as a result of higher
                                headquarters tasking from outside of the wing.
Weather (WX)                    Actions canceled or not completed as a result of weather
                                conditions
Supply (SU)                     Deviations that result from verified parts back order condition.
Other (OT)                      Aircraft impounded after publication of the weekly schedule,
                                unscheduled major maintenance where the scheduled
                                maintenance action cannot be accomplished because of tech data
                                restrictions, aircraft off base and unable to return or as a result of
                                Productivity/Utilization Goal Days.
EXCEPTION: Any scheduled maintenance for an aircraft that is possessed by
depot/PDM/Contract Field Team (CFT), that is not complied with because the aircraft is not
released for possession as scheduled to the owning unit does not count toward MSE
computations.

        DEPLOYED OPERATIONS AND OFF-STATION/EN-ROUTE SORTIES

5.1. Purpose: This chapter establishes rules and procedures used in planning, executing,
evaluating, and reporting unit flying and maintenance scheduling process at deployed, off-station
and en route locations.
5.2. General: Normal deviation reporting only applies to deployed operations except as noted
in this chapter. Data from deployed operations will be transmitted or forwarded back to home
station and included in unit totals.
5.3. Deployed Operations: In addition to the procedures for home station scheduling and
reporting, deployed units will following procedures outlined in AFI 21-101paragraph 7.12.5. thru
7.12.5.4.3. when developing a weekly flying schedule and reporting deviations:
   5.3.1. Separate block(s) of sortie sequence numbers will be assigned for deployment
   location.
   5.3.2. When a spare aircraft is launched for a scheduled deployment to a Forward Operating
   Location (FOL), the originally scheduled aircraft may fly the sorties of the departed aircraft
   for the remainder of the week without recording FSE deviations. This applies to both the
   home station and deployment location flying and maintenance schedules.
   5.3.3. Additions and cancellations at deployed locations, which are required to accomplish
   specific aircrew training requirements and make optimum use of available range time, are
   considered flown as scheduled to allow the unit to make up non-effective sorties and ensure
   accomplishment of the deployment training plan. Procedures for changing the weekly
   schedule in Chapter 2 apply to deployment location flying and maintenance schedules.
   Additions and cancellations that result from ineffective planning are recorded.
   5.3.4. When operating at a deployed location using Air Tasking Order (ATO) the daily
   flying schedule including tail numbers for the first lines and spares will be finalized and
   confirmed NLT 2 hours prior to the first takeoff. Note: All sorties launched under ―classified
   ATOs‖ will be considered flown as scheduled.
5.4. Deployed Daily Activity Report: Information from deployed AFRC units will be
transmitted to home station IAW applicable unit deployment plans.
5.5. Off-Station Sorties. (CAF): Off-station sorties are those sorties flown from other than
home station and parent unit maintenance is not provided (e.g., cross-country sorties). Units will
publish sorties planned while off station. Take off and landing times may be TBD when
supporting another unit and the specific times are unknown at the time of publishing.
   5.5.1. When a spare is launched to an off-station/cross country location the originally
   scheduled aircraft may fly the sorties of the departed aircraft for the remainder of the week
   without recording FSE deviations.
   5.5.2. When an aircraft is off-station and cannot return to home station for its scheduled
   sortie, a deviation will be recorded for the reason the aircraft was unable to return. The
AFRCI21-165 7 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                    21


   reasons will be specific, i.e., maintenance, operations, weather, etc. NOTE: If the off-station
   aircraft can fly its scheduled mission from its location, no deviation is recorded.
5.6. En-route Sorties. (MAF): En-route sorties are sorties that occur between the point of
mission origin and final destination where the aircraft will stop. All en-route locations are
operated under Air Mobility Command and local unit guidance.
 22                                                       AFRCI21-165 7 FEBRUARY 2011


                                           Chapter 6

                                       ATTRITION/SPARE

6.1. Attrition. (CAF Only): Attrition factors represent historical percentage of scheduled
sorties lost to causes outside unit control. Maintenance and operations schedulers add attrition
sorties to monthly contracts to mitigate scheduling turbulence and ensure that unit’s mission
goals are met. Make scheduling adjustments to facilitate increases or decreases in anticipated
attrition. If at the end of a quarter combined losses exceed attrition figures, the OG and
MXG/CCs will negotiate a resolution to the shortfall.
   6.1.1. The factors used to compute attrition will be MXx, OPx, SUx, WXx, ATx, SYx, OTx,
   EXH, EXL, and HQx cancels. MMA will compute attrition factors monthly for each MDS
   and provide the results to MOF PS&D and OSS Current Operations. During the annual
   ―Proposed FHP‖, MMA will provide attrition factors by month for the entire upcoming fiscal
   year.
6.2. Attrition Factor Application:
   6.2.1. Attrition computation is based on unit historical data from previous similar flying
   months. For example, when computing attrition for Jan 06, use historical data for Jan 05, Jan
   04, Jan 03, Jan 02, Jan 01, etc. The formula for computing the attrition factor is Historical
   Sorties Lost divided by Historical Sorties Scheduled.

Table 6.1. Attrition Computation Example:
 Cancels:
 MX Cancels:                 .02
 OP Cancels:                 .01
 SU Cancels:                 .01
 OT Cancels:                 .01
 AT Cancels:                 .01
 SY Cancels:                 .01
 EXH Cancels:                .00
 EXL Cancels:                .01
 HQ Cancels:                 .01
 Cancels attrition factor:   .09
 WX Cancels:                 .03
 Total attrition factor:     .12

 Overall attrition factor .12 or 12%

Sorties Required:                       1000
Subtract attrition factor from 1:      (1-.12) =.88
Divide:                                1000 by .88
AFRCI21-165 7 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                       23


   6.2.3. Required sorties to schedule 1,136.36, round up to 1137. Based on historical attrition
   of 12%, the unit can expect to lose 137 sorties to meet the required 1000 sorties.
6.3. Spares (CAF): The spare requirements will not exceed 20 percent (30 percent for training
units owning TF coded aircraft) of aircraft committed to the flying schedule, rounded up to the
next whole aircraft. NOTE: During Planned Sortie Surges the MXG/CC determines the amount
of spares that will be committed.
   6.3.1. MDSA computes annual spare aircraft requirements by month, using historical aircraft
   first sortie logistics losses and provides the information to the MOF PS&D for use in
   computing spare aircraft requirements. Spare computation is based on unit historical data
   from previous similar flying months. For example, when computing spares for Jan 06, use
   historical data for Jan 05, Jan 04, Jan 03, Jan 02, Jan 01, etc. Use as much historical data as
   required ensuring seasonal variations are considered to determine a basis. The formula for
   computing spare factors is Historical First Sortie Deletions/Cancellation divided by historical
   first sorties scheduled.
       6.3.1.1. A first sortie is defined as a sortie flown by an aircraft that has not previously
       flown for the day (0001-2400 flying period). For example, if eight aircraft are committed
       to the schedule and there are 14 total sorties scheduled, the first eight sortie line numbers
       (i.e. 101-108) should reflect all eight committed aircraft tail numbers before they are re-
       scheduled (turned) against the last six (i.e. 109-114). This would be reflected as an ―8 x
       6‖ and should not be reflected as a ―6 x 8‖ because of scheduled take-off times.
           6.3.1.1.1. Operations may define first sorties or turns by mission profile, take-off
           times, but for the purposes of this instruction the sortie turn pattern is defined against
           initial aircraft flown and scheduled turns of the same or a portion of the same aircraft.
       6.3.1.2. Sample Application of Spare Factors.

Table 6.4. Sample Figure of 12 First Sorties.
 A sample figure of 12 first sorties is used in the following computation:

 Spare aircraft required equals 1st sorties scheduled times the spare factor and rounded up to the
 next whole number. 12 x .18 = 2.16 Spares required is three

   6.3.2. (MAF) Spare aircraft should not exceed 20 percent. For units with more than 10
   aircraft assigned, 30 percent allowed with the commander’s approval.

                       ASSESSING THE HEALTH OF THE FLEET

7.1. Health of Fleet Management: The Maintenance Management Analyst (MMA) is the focal
point for the management information systems (MIS) in the maintenance complex, providing
assistance with information availability and data retrieval. The analysts turn raw data into
information (HHQ reports, special studies, and maintenance analysis referrals) used to evaluate
the effectiveness and efficiency of a unit’s maintenance effort. While some of these products are
devised and used only at the unit level, others are monitored at higher headquarters.
   7.1.1. One way to gauge a unit’s performance is to compare its rates to those of other units
   Air Force-wide with the same type aircraft and fleet size. Comparing present performance to
   past performance and current trends to past trends may also reveal insights into the relative
   health of a unit.
       7.1.1.1. Identifies some key metrics, provides a brief description of each metric with the
       desired trend, and presents some things to consider when a unit’s performance is not
       meeting the desired trend.

Terms
Addition—An increase in sorties or aircraft added to the printed weekly flying schedule.
Air Abort—An airborne aircraft that cannot complete its primary or alternate mission.
Air Deviation Code—A deviation from the scheduled sortie flight plan occurring after aircraft
take-off.
Alert Sorties—Sorties flown from alert because of a higher headquarters exercise, active air or
practice scramble, or committed to fly from alert on the printed weekly schedule will be
considered sorties scheduled and flown as scheduled.
Attrition—Losses expected based on historical data. Sorties added by maintenance scheduling
to a unit's sortie contract to allow for expected losses due to maintenance, operations, supply, air
traffic control, sympathy, HHQ, other cancels, and weather cancels as computed. If attrition is
less or more than planned, adjustments to the schedule should be made to prevent overextending
maintenance and/or to stay within the unit's sortie flying hour program. Attrition sorties are not
substitutes for capability shortfalls; they are additive to the contract to ensure mission goals are
met. A sortie lost will normally be flown in the week/month the loss occurred. If at the end of a
quarter, losses exceed attrition figures, the OG/MXG CCs will come to an agreement on how the
shortfall will be corrected.
Attrition Reserve—Reference AFI 16-402, Aerospace Vehicle Programming, Assignment,
Distribution, AFRC counting, and Termination. Attrition reserve aircraft are those aircraft
required to replace primary aircraft inventory losses in a given year projected over the life span
AFRCI21-165 7 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                    33


of the weapons system. These aircraft are distributed to operational and training units to evenly
spread life cycle fatigue and ensure all aircraft receive periodic systems upgrades and
modifications. Assigned attrition reserves are occasionally realigned to maintain fleet balance.
Backup Aircraft Inventory (BAI)—Aircraft above the PMAI to permit scheduled and
unscheduled maintenance, modifications, inspections and repair without reduction of aircraft
available for operational missions.
Cancellation—An aircraft or sortie that is removed from the printed schedule for any reason.
Change—A recompilation of a unit's month-by-month flying hour plan, this is required when
the unit's flying hour allocation changes.
Chargeable Aircraft (CHRG ACFT)—The number of aircraft against which units should build
their programs. Except in cases where possessed aircraft is forecast to be significantly different
from the PMAI such as in building or down-sizing units, chargeable aircraft will normally equal
the unit's PMAI, PTAI, or PDAI, as applicable. In these cases, HQ AFRC/DO/A4 will assign a
chargeable aircraft AFRC accountability for the unit in the AFRC Flying Hour First Look and
Baseline Messages.
Classic Associate—AD component unit retains principal responsibility for weapon system or
systems; shares with one or more ARC/ANG units.
Combat Sortie Generation—A process by which aircraft are generated in a minimum time,
during peacetime or wartime, through concurrent operations that may include refueling,
munitions loading/unloading, aircraft reconfiguration, and -6 inspection and other servicing
requirements. These exercises test a wing’s ability to meet current war plans and contingency
operations.
Continuation Sortie—A scheduled sortie containing scheduled operation stops. When a crew
completes their training/mission and performs an operation stop, the engines/APU remains
running and maintenance does not service the aircraft. The aircraft can subsequently be launched
without the participation of maintenance personnel, except for a fire/safety observer. The prime
purpose is to on/off load crewmembers. EXCEPTION: For safety, C-130 aircraft, engines may
be shut down to upload/download personnel. NOTE: N/A to fighter and attack aircraft.
Crew Ready—An aircraft that has been properly inspected, fueled, required weapons loaded,
necessary maintenance actions completed, the exceptional release signed off (for the first flight
of the day) and the tail number passed to operations. NOTE: Units will develop and publish
specific crew ready times for each assigned MDS as agreed upon by the OG/CC and MXG/CC.
Crew Show—The time that the aircrew arrives at the aircraft.
Deployed Sorties—Sorties launched away from home base or isolated areas at home base, with
parent-unit maintenance provided. For the purpose of this instruction deployed sorties are
considered home station sorties.
Daily Maintenance Production Meeting—Meeting required by AFI 21-101 to review the
previous day’s accomplishments, verify aircraft and equipment utilization and scheduled
maintenance requirements for the current and next day, establish work priorities, and coordinate
schedule changes.
Deviation—A departure from the printed weekly flying schedule.

Early Landing—Scheduled sorties landing more than 15 minutes prior to scheduled landing
time. Do not record early landing deviations for hot pit turn sorties launched more than 15
minutes prior to the scheduled take-off time. Early landing deviations are not included in FSE
calculations.
Early Take-off—Scheduled sorties launched more than 30 minutes prior to scheduled take-off.
NOTE: Do not record early take-off deviations for hot pit turn sorties.
En-Route Sortie—Sorties that occur between the point of mission origin and final destination at
which aircraft will stop.
Exercise—A unit or higher headquarters event designed to test or evaluate an organization's
plans, procedures, and operational/maintenance capabilities. Exercises are a planned sortie surge,
a combat sortie generation, or an unscheduled tasking. Operational readiness inspections and
wing directed operational readiness evaluations are combat sortie generations.
Extended Sortie—Scheduled sorties that land more than 15 minutes past the scheduled landing
time. If the extended sortie originated on time, record the subsequent late take-off or deletion
against the agency that caused the late landing. If the extended sortie did not originate on time,
record the subsequent sortie deviation against the agency that caused the original delay.
External Customer—Outside the control of the operational wing, a user of aircraft sorties that
dictates, either partially or wholly, flying schedule execution (e.g., Joint Airborne Air
Transportability Training (JA/ATT) users, Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM) users or
channel mission users.
Ferry Sortie—Those sorties flown to transfer an aircraft to or from a maintenance facility or to a
new assignment, including inter-command, inter-unit transfers.
Flown as Scheduled Sortie—A sortie flown by a specific aircraft on the date and time indicated
on the printed weekly schedule, and those aircraft that are defined as "flown as scheduled"
elsewhere in this instruction.
Flying Scheduling Effectiveness (FSE) Rate—The FSE rate is the percentage of sorties flown
as scheduled. This rate determines how efficiently the planned/printed flying schedule was
executed. It also indicates unit turmoil caused by flying schedule deviations.
FSE Maintenance/Operations (MX/OPS) Deviation Rate—The number of maintenance and
operations deviations divided by adjusted sorties scheduled multiplied by 100. Reflects the
number of deviations within unit control. The MX/OPS deviation rate is a subset of FSE. Only
count the MX/OPS deviations used to compute the FSE rate.
Functional Check Flight (FCF)—The flight of an aircraft, in accordance with the applicable
dash -6 manual, to verify the airworthy condition of the aircraft.
Ground Abort—Event after crew show time that prevents a "crew ready" aircraft from
becoming airborne. Ground aborts are categorized as maintenance (GAA, GAB, GAC),
operations, HHQ, weather, sympathy, other, etc… The difference between a ground abort and a
cancellation is after crew show it is a ground abort, before crew show it is a cancel. A ground
abort by itself is not a deviation, but can cause a deviation such as lost sortie or late take-off.
Higher Headquarters—A controlling agency above wing level.
AFRCI21-165 7 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                      35


Home Station Sortie—Sorties launched from the home base or deployed locations where parent
unit maintenance is provided.
Hot Pit Turn—Refueling aircraft with engines running between sorties at a designated location
with approved equipment IAW TO 00-25-172. Hot pit refueling provides minimum aircraft
turnaround time and reduces fueling personnel and equipment support requirements.

which allow flexibility in meeting required Designed Operational Capability (DOC) timing.
In-Flight Emergency (IFE)—An airborne aircraft that encounters a situation or emergency that
results in an IFE being declared by the aircrew. (Not a deviation, but will be recorded IAW
Chapter 3.)
Tail Swap—Tail number swaps made to the daily flying schedule. Aircraft tail swaps are swaps
between printed aircraft on the same day, between printed aircraft and spare aircraft on the same
day or between printed aircraft and aircraft that have previously flown that day (cross country
return, OCF, FCF, etc.) The term is synonymous with the previously used term ―Interchange.‖
Late Landing—Aircraft landing more than 15 minutes past its scheduled landing time. Does not
apply to continuation sorties. If the sortie originated on time, record the subsequent late take-off
or cancellation against the agency that caused the late landing. If the extended sortie did not
originate on time, record the subsequent sortie deviation against the agency that caused the
original delay. Late landings are not included in FSE calculations.
Late Take-off—Scheduled sortie launched more than 15 minutes after scheduled take-off time.
Maintenance Scheduling Effectiveness—A measurement used to determine what percent of the
scheduled maintenance actions were actually completed as scheduled in the weekly flying
schedule.

example: B052H, F015C, etc.
Off-Station Sorties—Sorties flown away from home base (cross-country) and parent unit
maintenance is not provided. This includes aircraft that divert or break off-station and parent unit
maintenance is sent to repair and launch the aircraft. NOTE: Off-station sorties are considered
flown as scheduled. Deviations incurred are not used in scheduling effectiveness or abort rate
computations.
Operational Check Flight (OCF)—The first flight of an aircraft that has had extended
downtime or extensive maintenance which does not require an FCF.
Operations and Maintenance Day (O&M)—Monday through Friday, not including federal
holidays or command directed family days.
Pen-and-Ink Changes—Changes made to next week's flying schedule on AF Form 2407 after
the WG/CC has signed the schedule and prior to 1600 hours local Friday. Exception: Pen-and-
Ink changes are allowed 2 hours after the squadron's last landing during printed wing night flying
weeks.
Planned Sortie Surge—A scheduling option where a unit may plan to produce sorties at a
higher than normal rate. To qualify as a surge, the number of planned sorties will exceed the
 36                                                          AFRCI21-165 7 FEBRUARY 2011

associated flying hours derived using the flying hour program models.
Scheduled Sortie—An aircraft scheduled for flight by tail number on the weekly flying schedule
and confirmed on the daily flying schedule. Incentive flights are considered scheduled sorties
and published in the weekly schedule. Functional Check Flights and Operational Check Flights
are excluded.
Scheduled Maintenance Action—A maintenance requirement printed in the weekly schedule.
Sortie—A sortie begins when an aircraft becomes airborne or takes off vertically from rest at
any point of support. It ends after airborne flight when the aircraft returns to the surface except
for continuation sorties.
Sortie Contract—A written agreement between operations and maintenance and approved by
the WG/CC. It specifies the number of sorties and hours to be flown.
Spare Aircraft—An aircraft specifically designated on the flying schedule to replace aircraft
that cannot fly its sortie. Spares can include aircraft that have been canceled, aborted, flown an
earlier sortie, scheduled in a later sortie, or an aircraft that has been released after FCF/OCF. Do
not count "Printed Spares" used as deviations when computing FSE.
Spare Ground Abort—Event after crew show time that prevents a "crew ready" aircraft from
becoming airborne, but is replaced by a spare that meets the mission requirement. Spare ground
aborts are categorized as maintenance (GAA, GAB, GAC). The difference between a ground
abort and a spare ground abort is the scheduled line is AFRC accomplished, where the ground
abort is not. A spare ground abort is not a deviation, but can cause a deviation such as late take-
off. Spare ground aborts do not count towards FSE.
Total Active Inventory (TAI)—Aircraft assigned to operating forces for mission, training, test,
or maintenance functions (includes primary aircraft inventory, backup aircraft inventory,
attrition, and reconstitution reserve).

troop program unit members. (AR 135-91)
Regularly scheduled unit training assembly (RSUTA)—Training time treated as a UTA or
MUTA for which pay and retirement point credit are authorized. (AR 140-1)
UTE Remaining—A measurement of the UTE required to AFRC accomplish a unit's remaining
flying hours with assigned aircraft over the remaining months of the fiscal year.
Utilization Rate (UTE)—For AFRC aircraft, the UTE is expressed in the number of sorties
flown per aircraft per month.
Weekly Flying and Maintenance Schedule—The schedule, agreed to by operations and
maintenance, and signed by the OG/MXG/WG/CCs, to support the unit's flying and maintenance
requirements. In this publication it is referred to as the "flying schedule."

                       MAINTENANCE CAPABILITIES FORMULAS

A5.1. Airframe Capability Computations: In our computations, we look for maximum
capability.

Table A5.1. Airframe Capability Computations.

 Initial Sortie Capability=                  Possessed Aircraft – Maintenance Factors*MC rate
                                             *Operational and Maintenance (O&M) days per year

 First Turn Aircraft Available=              Possessed Aircraft – Maintenance Factors

 First Turn Sortie Capability=               First Turn Aircraft Available*MC rate*O&M days

 Sortie Capability=                          Initial Sortie Capability + First Turn Capability

 Projected Sortie Losses=                    Sortie Capability* Attrition Rate

 Maximum Sortie Capability=                  Sortie Capability – Projected Sortie Losses

 Maximum Flying Hour Capability=             Maximum Sortie Capability*Average Sortie.
 (Maximum Sortie Capability/Possessed Aircraft)
 Maximum Sortie UTE Rate =12
A5.2. Facility Capability Computations
   A5.2.1. To determine the dock requirements, use the following formulas:

Table A5.2. Facility Capability Computations.
 Number of Inspections Required =            Flying Hours Scheduled
                                             Inspections Cycle
 Dock Days Required =                        Number of Inspections Required*Average Dock Days
                                             per inspection Work Days per Month
