This Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) establishes AF policy and provides guidance for Airspace/Range
Management and Airfield Operations to include Air Traffic Control and Airfield Management. This pol-
icy directive applies to all AF and AF contractor activities, including the Air National Guard and Air
Force Reserve. This directive implements DoD Directive 5030.19, DoD Responsibilities on Federal Avi-
ation and National Airspace System Matters. Refer recommended changes and questions about his publi-
cation to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for
Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through MAJOR Command (MAJCOM) pub-
lications/forms managers. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publi-
cation are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-363),
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/. See Attachment 1 for a glossary of references and support-
ing information.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This version supersedes all pre-
vious versions of AFPD 13-2.


1. General: The Air Force must sustain a safe and operationally relevant flying environment that pro-
motes combat readiness. This directive supports these objectives by providing management policies gov-
erning air traffic, airfield operations, airspace use, ranges, and air operation support facilities and
equipment controlled by the Air Force and Air Reserve Component.
   1.1. The Air Force will provide airspace, ranges and aviation support facilities, equipment and ser-
   vices that support the full spectrum of Air Force operations. Resources will be established and safely
   operated in compliance with applicable laws and regulations contained in Attachment 1. To the great-
2                                                                             AFPD13-2 7 AUGUST 2007


    est extent possible, the Air Force will employ all reasonable measures to mitigate detrimental impacts
    on the public and the environment when using ranges, aviation support facilities and equipment and
    airspace.
    1.2. The Air Force provides only the aviation support facilities, equipment, and services needed to
    accomplish its flying mission, including those complementary services integrated into the national air-
    space system. If other agencies provide these resources, the Air Force will not duplicate the services.

2. Airfield Operations Support (Air Traffic Control and Airfield Management). T h e A i r F o r c e
staffs, operates and maintains airfield operations assets in peacetime for the purpose of directly supporting
the expeditionary nature of Air Force contingency operations, in terms of readiness, deployable capabil-
ity, and currency to include all related airfield support activities.

3. Airspace Management.
    3.1. Special Use Airspace/Airspace for Special Use (SUA/ASU). HQ USAF develops policy, advo-
    cates for resources, and manages the oversight process for SUA/ASU. The Air Force will only man-
    age SUA/ASU if one of the following two criteria is met: 1) Management of the SUA/ASU by the Air
    Force enables the Air Force to perform its mission, or 2) the SUA/ASU enables another service to per-
    form itâ€™s mission and it is clearly determined the AF is the best service to manage the SUA/ASU. AF
    managed SUA/ASU that does not meet the aforementioned criteria will be offered to another Depart-
    ment of Defense (DoD) Service for management. If another DoD Service does not require the SUA/
    ASU, it will be returned to the FAA or applicable host nation agency. Air Force units (and MAJ-
    COMS) will periodically review the SUA/ASU they manage to ensure it still meets the aforemen-
    tioned criteria. Additionally, whenever AF-managed SUA/ASU is not being used it shall be made
    available to the FAA or applicable host nation agency for civil use in accordance with DoD Directive
    5030.19, DoD Responsibilities on Federal Aviation and National Airspace System Matters.
    3.2. Combat Airspace Management. HQ USAF provides operational guidance on Combat Airspace
    Management to all Air and Space Operations Centers through compliance with Joint and AF doctrine
    to include AFDD 2-17, Airspace Control in the Combat Zone, JP 3-52, Joint Doctrine For Airspace
    Control in the Combat Zone and AFTTP(I) 3-2.17, Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Proce-
    dures for the Theater Air Ground System.

4. Ranges. The Air Force will staff, operate and maintain ranges that, as an aggregate, support the full
scope of air, space and information operations. These ranges can be used to perform either testing or train-
ing activities. Ranges are available for inter-service, intra-service, and foreign services use. Civilian activ-
ities can use these ranges for compatible operations on a non-interference basis provided no cost or
liability is incurred by the Air Force.

5. Attachment:
    5.1. See Attachment 1 for related publications used in this directive.
