This instruction establishes policies, procedures, and responsibilities for scheduling operations at
the 30th Space Wing (30 SW) Western Range (WR). It defines the methods by which 30 SW
resources are committed for range operations and maintenance. This procedure allows for the
scheduling of Range User operational requirements in support of ballistic missiles, spacelift,
surveillance, and aircraft test flights. The document implements AFI13-201, Air Force Space
Management, dated 20 September 2001. The provisions contained in this instruction apply to all
personnel and agencies requiring the use of WR controlled range resources. Refer recommended
changes and questions about this instruction to 2 ROPS/DOS using AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publications. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained IAW AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to
AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records, and disposed of IAW the Air Force Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/.

Range Scheduling Mission. The 2nd Range Operations Squadron Scheduling Flight (2
ROPS/DOS) is the single scheduling authority for all launches, launch associated tests, and
internal range activities requiring Western Range and base support resources. The objective is to
ensure that all test operations and associated data requirements are fully supported on the dates
and times selected by the range user, or as close to the requested time as possible. Range
Scheduling will honor each authorized schedule request consistent with mission priorities, range
capabilities, economy of operations, funding availability, and established safety and security
criteria.

                                           Chapter 1

                                          GENERAL

1.1. Scheduling Philosophy. The 2d Range Operations Scheduling Flight (2 ROPS/DOS)
serves as the 30th Space Wing impartial scheduling broker by considering all requests based on
the following criteria. Launch and associated checkouts have the highest priority. In addition,
major milestone critical path testing/operations will usually take precedence over non-launch test
operations. Scheduling conflicts that arise during operations will be resolved by the Range
Control Officer (RCO), Aeronautical Operations Control Officer (AOCO), Program Support
Manager (PSM), or 2 ROPS/DOS, as appropriate. All other scheduling issues or conflicts will
be resolved by 2 ROPS/DOS through negotiation (by direct contact with affected parties and/or
support agencies) or other appropriate means as necessary to resolve the conflict.
1.2. Operating Policies.
   1.2.1. Support commitment. Range resources are committed for support upon approval of
   the request and in accordance with applicable Operations Directives (ODs), internal test
   directives, message instructions, and verbal agreements which have been deemed necessary
   for ensuring the efficient use of range assets. Resources are allocated so that a maximum
   number of operational requirements can be supported safely. Range resources include, but
   are not limited to, instrumentation (telemetry, metric radars, command systems, optics, etc.),
   airspace, radio frequencies, support facilities, and base support services and activities.
   1.2.2. WR operates primarily on a first-come first-served basis with exceptions. Launch and
   launch related milestone requests are processed in the order in which they are received.
   Other support requests, including internal range maintenance and testing, are scheduled
   based on range priorities and resource availability. All requirements for operational support
   by 30 SW assets will be requested through and scheduled by 2 ROPS/DOS.
   1.2.3. Authorized Schedulers. Operational support requests will be accepted only from
   authorized schedulers who have been designated, in writing, by unit commanders or
   equivalent commercial project directors and submitted to 2 ROPS/DOS (Attachment 2).
   1.2.4. Overtime. The 30th Space Wing is resourced to operate based on a 40-hour work
   week.     Requests for overtime support by wing or Western Range Operations
   Communications and Information (WROCI) contractor personnel will not normally be
   accepted unless specifically approved by Commander 2d Range Operations Squadron (2
   ROPS/CC). See paragraph 1.5.1. of this instruction for a full description of overtime rules,
   responsibilities, and exceptions.
   1.2.5. Priorities. Launch, major launch milestone tests, critical maintenance activities and
   pre-launch calibration (L-1 day) checks normally will be assigned the highest priority
   followed by other range activities; to include preventative maintenance and periodic depot
   maintenance. The following general guidelines are used when determining range priorities:
       1.2.5.1. Corrective maintenance, pre-launch, and launch support will normally take
       precedence over other schedule requests.
6                                                             30SWI13-203 26 AUGUST 2009


       1.2.5.2. Critical milestone pre-launch certification operations that must be successfully
       completed on the dates requested, and are determined to be essential in meeting customer
       launch dates, shall have precedence over less time sensitive operations that, if scheduled
       for another period, would not result in a launch date change.
    1.2.6. Additional factors such as inter-range support, communications, national urgency,
    orbital parameters, space or scientific achievement, DoD exercises, and planned maintenance
    activities will be strongly considered when determining scheduling priorities. Lastly, crew
    rest requirements for operations and maintenance personnel will be considered when
    scheduling any activity.
    1.2.7. Pre-launch Calibrations (L-1 day checks) Scheduling. Pre-launch instrumentation
    calibration checks, contained in Operations Directive 6600 (Range Operations Tests), are
    normally scheduled during normal duty hours on the first workday preceding each launch.
    These checks will carry the same priority as the associated launch operation. It is range
    policy not to schedule L-1 day checks after normal duty hours, weekends, or holidays. After
    L-1 checks, the range shall be in a state of ‘locked down for launch’ that would preclude any
    change in launch configuration. Lock down configuration can only be waived by the 2
    ROPS/CC/DO.
    1.2.8. In an effort to more efficiently plan for overtime and other range contingencies,
    customers are required to submit all schedule requirements by noon Thursday a minimum of
    2 weeks in advance of the planned date. Acceptance of requests after this cutoff date will be
    considered based on criticality, range priority, resource availability, and other factors as
    necessary to meet the Wing mission.
    1.2.9. To maximize range resource utilization efficiency, the scheduling of requirements on
    a non-interference basis (NIB) is discouraged.
    1.2.10. Similarly, users are requested not to schedule more range time than necessary. The
    practice of scheduling additional time in anticipation that problems may develop is
    prohibited. Inefficient scheduling of operations by users could impact accomplishing their
    mission. Rather, if problems do occur that will cause an extension to the scheduled
    operation, the request should be made immediately to 2 ROPS/DOS. The Real-time request
    will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. This includes any extensions.
1.3. Operation Number Assignment. The Range Scheduling Flight assigns operation numbers
to each scheduled test for tracking and control purposes. Operation numbers consist of four
digits preceded by an alpha character identifying the lead range or activity type. Alpha numeric
designators are used to enhance and supplement Operations Security (OPSEC) requirements, as
necessary. Alpha character designators are listed in Table 1.1.

         be taken out of the operationally certified state or that do not require “formal” recertification.
  4.     “F” operations are defined as range sustainment periods or major maintenance /
         modifications that cause range systems to be in an uncertified state and will require formal
         recertification.
  5.     Planned maintenance actions causing major range instrumentation (command, telemetry,
         radar, and communications) to be non operational or unavailable for longer than 24 hours
         must be coordinated through 2 ROPS/DOS (MOCC) and approved by Range Stakeholders “
         prior” to taking systems down.
1.4. Transaction Codes. Each operation is tracked from the time it first appears on the
schedule through final disposition. All scheduling events associated with each operation are
recorded on a Schedule Operation Record Card (SORC) and loaded (electronically entered) into
8                                                             30SWI13-203 26 AUGUST 2009


the range scheduling data base. The Range Automated Tasking System (RATS) is used for this
purpose. Transaction codes are used for identifying the type of scheduling activity. The codes
are used primarily for internal tracking purposes. However, individual users can check the status
of operations by referring to the below listing of transaction codes:
    1.4.1. (A) Add – A new operation that is added to the current week schedule after the
    weekly schedule has been published.
    1.4.2. (X) Cancellation – The early termination of an operation after some range time has
    been expended. Cancelled operations will not reappear using the same operation number.
    Cancelled operations are transferred to historical files (final disposition).
    1.4.3. (C) Complete - Successful termination (completion) of an operation. Completed
    operations are transferred to historical files (final disposition).
    1.4.4. (E) Extension - Used to extend the operation end time beyond the original window
    after the operation has commenced.
    1.4.5. (F) Forecast - An operation scheduled in the future (beyond the current schedule
    week).
    1.4.6. (I) Indefinite - A scheduled operation which has been suspended (temporarily taken
    off the active schedule); rescheduling information is pending or unavailable and the new
    schedule date and/or time is unknown.
    1.4.7. (D) Delete - Early termination of a scheduled operation before range time has been
    expended. Deleted operation numbers are transferred to historical files (final disposition).
    1.4.8. (R) Reschedule - Any change in date(s) and/or time(s) to a scheduled operation prior
    to the start of initial setup.
    1.4.9. (S) Scrub – Early termination of an operation after some range time has been
    expended with the expectation that the operation will soon be or is already in the process of
    being rescheduled. The activity may reappear under the same operation number.
    1.4.10. (U) Update – A transaction code used to denote other operation changes not
    affecting the scheduled date(s) and/or time(s).
    1.4.11. Example transaction code: W1234 X. W1234 represents the WR operation number
    (Op Number) followed by transaction code; “X” indicates this operation was cancelled.
1.5. Days and Hours of Operation.
    1.5.1. 30 SW is resourced to operate the WR based on a 40 hour work week. Operational
    requests for support by wing and/or WROCI personnel on weekends, federal holidays, and
    Wing/AFSPC directed down days will not normally be accepted. Requests for exceptions to
    this policy will be coordinated through the 30 RMS/CC, 30 SW Program Lead and/or the 2
    ROPS Program Support Manager, through 2 ROPS Scheduling Flight, then forwarded to 2
    ROPS/CC for adjudication. 30 OG/CC will have final approval authority.
    1.5.2. The Range Scheduling office (2 ROPS/DOS) is normally operational Monday-Friday
    (0700-1600), excluding major holidays. Scheduling support is also provided during all
    launch countdown operations occurring outside of normal duty hours. Staffing will normally
30SWI13-203 26 AUGUST 2009                                                                     9


   be no earlier than 3 hours prior to the planned T-0, or as directed, and will continue through
   operation completion.
   1.5.3. Western instrumentation operating hours are normally 0700-1600, Monday through
   Friday, excluding designated holidays and Wing/AFSPC directed down days (including any
   required setup / post op requirements).
1.6. Overtime Operations
   1.6.1. The 2 ROPS/CC in conjunction with the Program Support Manager (PSM) normally
   serves as the reimbursable Job Order Number (JON) approval authority for scheduling
   support provided outside of normal duty hours. The PSM is responsible for confirming that
   range customers (both commercial and government) have sufficient funding available to
   cover civilian overtime expenses. Overtime support will be dependent upon PSM
   coordination, and resource and personnel availability.
   1.6.2. 30 OG/CC serves as the overtime approval authority for all non-reimbursable JON
   (institutional/direct funds) overtime charges. These requests will be routed thru the 2
   ROPS/CC prior to requesting approval by the 30 OG/CC.
   1.6.3. Users are required to notify Range Scheduling NLT 48 hours prior to any overtime
   requests, normally users should request overtime operations through the Scheduling
   Forecaster 2 weeks prior to the operation.
1.7. After Support. Requests for support after normal range operating hours (when the range
is closed) will be coordinated through 2 ROPS/DO by contacting the 30 SW Command Post at
DSN 276-9961 or COM 805-606-9961.
   1.7.1. Overtime operations extensions (operations that are in progress during non-duty
   hours) may be granted if instrumentation and personnel are available and crew rest
   requirements will not be exceeded. Similarly, overtime operations may be rescheduled to
   other times depending upon resource and personnel availability only if crew rest restrictions
   will not be exceeded and      2 ROPS/CC approves the change.
1.8. Hazardous Test Operations. Hazardous test operations will be scheduled in accordance
with Chapters 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7, 127-1, Range Safety Requirements and Volumes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6,
and 7, AFSPCMAN 91-710, Range Safety User Requirements. See Attachment 1.
1.9. Operational Resource Certification. Normally, range instrumentation, communications,
and data systems (both hardware and software) will be committed for use by Western Range
customers only after these systems have been fully certified by 30 Range Management
Squadron/ Range Systems (30 RMS/RMR). New equipment, and existing range systems under
modification, must successfully complete a formal operational certification process prior to
commissioning them for operational use on the range. Upon operational certification, range
resources will be scheduled be in accordance with paragraph 1.2 of this instruction.

1.11. Scheduling and Operation Closeout Policy. Customers are required to close out
(complete) all scheduled operations no later than the scheduled completion time unless an
extension has been requested and approved. In addition customers will call the Range
Scheduling office when operations are terminated/completed early (prior to scheduled end) to
avoid unnecessary program costs. Operation closeout procedures are outlined in paragraph 5.4.5.
of this instruction. Failure to close out operations at the scheduled end time will result in the
following actions.
     1.11.1. First time offenses will result in a failure to comply memorandum warning from the
     2 ROPS/DO. Any subsequent violation(s) will then result in a final memorandum from the 2
     ROPS/CC to the user organization commander (or civilian equivalent), barring them from
     Western Range scheduling access until the user commits to supporting the guidelines
     established in this instruction. Subsequent customer support requests will require 2
     ROPS/CC authorization and concurrence at (805) 606-9881 prior to regaining scheduling
     privileges. Customers who fail to notify the scheduling office when operations are
     terminated/completed early will incur the costs associated with the scheduled operation end
     time.
1.12. Customer Contact Policy. Point of contact telephone number(s) applicable to both duty
and non-duty hours are required for each scheduled operation. After hours point of contact(s)
must be directly connected to each scheduled operation and must be reachable by phone for the
duration of the operation.          Operations cannot be scheduled unless primary and
alternate/associated contact information is provided.
30SWI13-203 26 AUGUST 2009                                                                   11

                                         PLANNING

2.1. Program Support Manager (PSM). The PSM Flight (2 ROPS/DOF) is the primary point
of contact for range customers during document generation activities to include: obtaining,
coordinating, and defining customer and range safety operational requirements and Operations
Directive (OD) development. The PSM is responsible for all Universal Documentation System
(UDS) actions and will coordinate supporting range(s) and base agencies support prior to the
mission execution phase. As lead range planner for spacelift, ballistic missile launches, and
aeronautical test missions, the PSM advises range operators and range contractor personnel
during actual operations.
2.2. Universal Documentation System (UDS). Western missions are conducted utilizing the
UDS. The Range Commanders Council adopted UDS as the national standard for documenting
range operational requirements. DoDD 3200.11 directs the use of UDS; it incorporates program
and safety requirements into a single tasking document known as the Operations Directive (OD).
The OD defines operational requirements and is used by Range Scheduling (2 ROPS/DOS) to
schedule and task operational systems and base support agencies. It also provides the basis for
charging customers for the support provided by the range. The UDS is divided into two levels.
   2.2.1. UDS documentation initiates program support planning between range users and the
   30 SW. UDS establishes program scope, program support activities, and acceptance by the
   30 SW of range user programs. UDS documentation is normally generated for all new 30
   SW programs.
   2.2.2. UDS Level Two. Level Two UDS documentation provides additional information not
   covered under Level One. Level Two provides detailed systems level information and
   requirements. Range customers generate this information in the Program Requirements
   Document (PRD). The PRD is required in order to assess range support capability and to
   plan accordingly. Wing response to the PRD is by means of the Program Support Plan
   (PSP). The PSP constitutes WR commitment to support range user program requirements.
   2.2.3. UDS Level Three. UDS Level Three documentation consists of the Operations
   Requirements (OR) document generated by the customer and submitted to the PSM. The
   range responds to OR requirements by generating the Operations Directive (OD) prepared by
   the PSM. The OR is used to define the programs requirements for pre-launch and launch
   testing. OR documents are generally due to the range 60 days prior to first support and the
   OD is normally produced 30 days prior to first support. The signed OD is the source
   documentation used by customers to schedule all pre-launch tests and identifies 30 SW
   launch requirements. When programs require extended support, the OD is usually published
   in three sections. Section one contains general program information, section two provides
   specific pre-launch support tasking, and section three includes specific tasking requirements
   for the launch. The OD is approved by 2 ROPS/CC.

                                          SCHEDULING

3.1. 30 SW Range Scheduling. 2 ROPS/DOS operates both the 30 SW Advance Forecast
Element and the Joint Pacific Area Scheduling Office (JPASO). Although their scope and
function differ slightly, both offices have similar scheduling processes and operating procedures.
The main distinction between them is the scope of responsibilities. The Advance Forecast
Element is primarily responsible for scheduling activities originating at the , while JPASO is the
central inter-range schedule coordination agency for Pacific Area member ranges. Since basic
operating philosophies and scheduling procedures are similar, with many overlapping areas, the
term JPASO shall be used synonymously throughout this document when referring to either area.
3.2. 30 SW Advanced Forecast Element. The Advance Forecast Element provides scheduling
support for WR launch, pre-launch, and other 30 SW range activities. In addition, it is
responsible for WR data production oversight and for operating the 30 SW Maintenance and
Operations Coordination Center (MOCC).
3.3. Joint Pacific Area Scheduling Office (JPASO). 30 SW provides administrative support,
facilities, and personnel necessary for operating the JPASO office in accordance with a DoD
charter, granted by the Office of the Under Secretary for Defense Research & Engineering Test
and Evaluation, on 26 March 1968. Under the provisions of the charter, 30 SW is charged with
administering the JPASO organization and for staffing the Director position. The 2 ROPS/DOS
Range Scheduling Flight Chief has responsibility for performing this duty.
     3.3.1. JPASO is the central coordination agency for all Pacific Area launch and re-entry
     operations scheduling between member ranges and organizations. The span of control
     includes providing scheduling support for customers and ranges in the geographic area
     westerly from 90 degrees west longitude to 90 degrees east longitude. All Pacific Area space
     launch, ballistic, and reentry operations, regardless of point of origin, will be coordinated and
     scheduled through the JPASO. JPASO responsibilities are outlined below.
     3.3.2. JPASO plans and chairs quarterly inter-range scheduling conferences at Vandenberg
     AFB CA. Conferences are scheduled by the JPASO Lead as required. Member range and
     affiliated organizations representatives present a comprehensive 6 month activity schedule
     including all major Pacific Area operations, other DoD range operations affecting Pacific
     Area sensors and shared resources (e.g., Navy P-3 aircraft), and Air Force Satellite Control
     Network (AFSCN).          Six-month schedules define all major operations and sensor
     downtimes/range sustainment periods affecting inter-range shared resources and support. In
     addition, members provide forecasts of projected major operations and range activities
     beyond 6 months. The combined schedules are then compiled and entered into a single data
     base for later publication. A classified JPASO booklet containing range briefing information
     (presented at conferences), along with the current and projected long-range joint schedule, is
     derived from individual member range inputs and then distributed to interested agencies
     within a few days following each conference. Finally, updated current and long-range
     JPASO schedules are transmitted to various agencies monthly.
3.4. Current Launch Schedule Review Board (CLSRB). 2 ROPS/DOS is the 30 SW OPR for
CLSRB meetings. The Western Range launch schedule is provided by the wing for inclusion in
30SWI13-203 26 AUGUST 2009                                                                     13


the HQ AFSPC 48-month Space Launch Manifest (SLM). The SLM is briefed to senior leaders
during semiannual CLSRB conference reviews and at quarterly government integration
meetings. 2 ROPS/DOS also supports heritage launch system multi-mission and other CLSRB
related meetings as required.
   3.4.1. CLSRB Launch Slot Allocations. 14 AF provides MAJCOM oversight of spacelift
   procedures and responsibilities. In addition, 14 AF conducts and chairs Current Launch
   Schedule (CLS) reviews for higher headquarters. Launch date changes within the first 24
   months (CLS) are approved by respective space wing commanders, provided all customers
   (launch vehicle, payload, maintenance) concur. When customers do not concur and issues
   cannot be resolved by the wing, 14 AF may review requests and resolve any conflicts. If
   conflicts still cannot be resolved, an out-of-cycle CLSRB may be convened to review and
   adjudicate the disagreements. 14 AF tracks and approves changes or additions to launch
   opportunities between 25 and 48 months of the SLM. Any changes involving designated
   Combatant Command (COCOM) launch queue opportunities which have not yet been
   released as excess capacity must be approved by the CLSRB.
3.5. Maintenance and (MOCC). 2 ROPS/DOS operates the 30th Space Wing MOCC. The
MOCC is responsible for integrating maintenance activities into the overall range schedule with
the goal of reducing or eliminating potential operational impacts resulting from these activities.
Additionally, the MOCC advises senior wing leadership on important range maintenance issues
and operational support impacts, as required. A weekly forum hosted by 2 ROPS/DOS and co-
chaired by 30 RMS/RMR is convened for the purpose of discussing operational issues and
maintenance concerns affecting all range organizations and customers. Meetings are normally
held each Thursday in the Bldg. 7025 Theater at 1330 local. MOCC meetings are open to all
organizations with participation and attendance highly encouraged. Recommended participants
include 30 LCG launch squadrons, 30 RMS, 30 CES, range support contractors (e.g., LO&SC,
WROCI, SLRS) and launch provider agencies (e.g., Boeing, Orbital, Lockheed-Martin), and any
other interested agencies.
   3.5.1. 2 ROPS is responsible for managing the official 30 SW MOCC internet website at
   URL: https://mocc.vandenberg.af.mil. It provides range status to the 30 SW Battle Staff as
   required. In addition, it is a readily accessible tool for senior leadership and range users.
   Range scheduling information supports the CLSRB, Spacelift Status Messages (SSM), and
   other reporting forums requiring 30 SW assets and/or schedule status.
3.6. Forecast Element. The Forecast Element is the official scheduling function responsible for
integrating all range and customer operational support requirements (schedule requests) into the
long-range schedule of planned activities beyond the current schedule week. In addition, the
forecast element is responsible for publishing the official approved weekly range schedule.
Official range schedules are effective for a 7-day period beginning Sunday at 0001L through the
following Saturday at 2359L and is published on the last working day of each week for the next
schedule week.         Once the official weekly schedule has been published, all scheduling
responsibilities are transferred to the Real Time Scheduling element.
3.7. Real Time Scheduling Element. The Real Time Scheduling Element is responsible for
performing all associated scheduling actions during the current week. Real Time assumes
responsibility for weekly schedules immediately upon publication (usually on the last working
day of each week). Changes or additions to the weekly schedule will be accepted based on
14                                                               30SWI13-203 26 AUGUST 2009


criticality, range priorities, resource availability, and other factors as necessary to accomplish the
mission. New requests for support will not necessarily preempt range activities already on the
schedule unless there is full agreement between all parties and approved by 2 ROPS.
3.8. Data Production Planning and Control. The 2 ROPS/DOS Data Manager is responsible
for all test data production, planning, data quality, and data delivery oversight.
30SWI13-203 26 AUGUST 2009                                                                      15

                             RANGE SCHEDULING PROCESS

4.1. WR Scheduling Process. Western Range and Pacific Area space launch, ballistic, and
reentry operation schedules will be derived based on range user mandatory requirements and
will, to the maximum possible extent, fulfill less-than-mandatory requirements with remaining
resources, taking into consideration national priorities, requested launch dates, and the efficient
and economical use of range assets. The following sections describe the range scheduling
process in greater detail.
   4.1.1. Support Request Acceptance. Customer requests for operational support will only be
   accepted from authorized schedulers who have been formally designated in writing by unit
   commanders or equivalent commercial project directors and submitted to 2 ROPS/DOS
   (Attachment 2).
   4.1.2. Job Order Number (JON) Information Requirements. All schedule requests must
   include valid JON information as well as other pertinent details to facilitate coordination and
   scheduling of resources. Requests will not normally be accepted without valid JONs.
   4.1.3. 30 SW/XP is the wing initial contact for new range programs. Assistance in
   establishing new customer-funded JONs can be obtained from 30 SW/XP as required. The
   practice of charging internal range JONs (Institutional/direct funds) shall be avoided and will
   only be used for contingencies to facilitate critical testing when customer funding will not
   become available in sufficient time to preclude serious operational impacts to the program.
   In all other cases, customer JONs will be charged when support is requested.
   4.1.4. Only operations with valid ODs, or those defined as minor support, will qualify for
   scheduling support. All other operational requests will be considered based upon funding,
   time, and resource availability.
4.2. JPASO Launch Scheduling. All Pacific Area space launch, ballistic, and reentry
operations regardless of point of origin will be coordinated through and scheduled by JPASO.
   4.2.1. JPASO Scheduling Priorities. Pacific Area ranges requiring WR support which have
   been coordinated and scheduled through JPASO shall be accorded the same range priority as
   other WR launch customers. Likewise, WR missions requiring inter-range resources and
   support from member ranges shall be accorded similar priorities when coordinated and
   scheduled through the JPASO process.
4.3. WR Launch Scheduling. All customer launch date requests must be coordinated through
the JPASO office and formally submitted by letter to 2 ROPS/DOS. Initial (new) launch
requests should be received at least 60-90 days in advance to ensure all range and safety
requirements can be accomplished, and must include critical milestone activity schedules.
Requests must include required date(s), the “Unclassified” launch windows (expected launch
times), and valid JON information. Critical launch related major milestone activities directly
impacting launch provider ability to meet requested dates must be identified and deconflicted
before final request approval can be provided. Any 30 SW Form 5588, Launch Schedule
Change Request, for a launch date on the WR falling within 180 days of date the request is
received must include a list of major milestones (MDRs, ICEs, Systems Test, etc) requiring WR
16                                                             30SWI13-203 26 AUGUST 2009


support/instrumentation and requested dates for these milestones.          Several acceptable
transmission methods can be used to deliver requests to JPASO including hand delivered, mail,
email, and FAX. However, final approval is contingent upon receipt of the original signed
request. Approved launches and related major milestone critical path activities already on the
schedule will normally have priority over new launch requests. It is range policy that only one
launch date can be requested and processed at a time. Multiple launch date requests will not be
accepted.
     4.3.1. Launch Date Changes. All launch date changes will be coordinated through the
     JPASO office so that range and resource availability can be determined. Submission of
     formal written change requests to 2 ROPS/DOS is required with final approval contingent
     upon receipt of original signed requests. When customer change requests are submitted, it is
     range policy that the currently approved launch date is relinquished. The launch will be
     removed from the calendar and the date becomes immediately available to other customers.
     The mission is subsequently placed into an “Indefinite” status until the new request date has
     been processed, coordinated and approved.
     4.3.2. When launch changes occur, range scheduling activities can become labor intensive
     because of the requirement to reschedule associated launch support. Likewise, there is often
     significant impact to other range customer support when pre-launch activities are moved in
     response to changes. Customers are strongly encouraged to relinquish approved launch dates
     as soon as it is determined the date cannot be achieved. In addition, it is highly
     recommended that rescheduling of pre-launch activities be delayed until a new date is
     determined. If there is an extended scheduling delay, it is recommended that launch-
     associated operations be removed from the schedule entirely to free up range resources to
     other customers. Range users will not request unachievable launch dates (planning dates or
     place holders). 30 SW/CC reserves the right to remove launches from the schedule when it
     becomes clear approved dates cannot be achieved.
     4.3.3. Launch Opportunities. Range user request dates are scheduled with the understanding
     that normally two launch attempts will be available. If the launch cannot be completed on
     the first scheduled date (first attempt), the following day will normally be available for a
     second attempt. Every effort will be made to accommodate users that scrub on the first day
     but require more than 24 hours turnaround time before the second launch attempt. Other
     mission considerations may preclude such subsequent scheduling.
        4.3.3.1. Exceptions are as follows:
            4.3.3.1.1. If the range cannot support a second attempt, this information will be
            communicated to the customer to obtain concurrence. If the customer does not agree
            to this condition (only one launch opportunity available without a consecutive day
            backup), the range will discuss alternative dates where two consecutive opportunities
            can be provided. In cases where there is customer/range concurrence (to only one
            opportunity) but the first attempt fails, it is understood that the launch will
            automatically be moved to another open date that can be supported and mutually
            agreed upon in advance.
            4.3.3.1.2. In cases where range users submit launch requests based on the expectation
            that a previously scheduled customer will not require a second day launch

           customer elects to use the second day. Any launch customer wishing to advance
           ahead of, insert themselves between, or propose minimum turnaround time following
           a previously scheduled launch, may negotiate a schedule change with the customers
           involved, provided mutual agreement is obtained and WR capabilities can support the
           change.
   4.3.4. Launch Schedule conflict resolution.
       4.3.4.1. Inter-range scheduling conflicts will be resolved in accordance with JPASO
       charter agreements and this instruction.
       4.3.4.2. 30 SW launch scheduling conflicts will be resolved in accordance with AFSPCI
       10-1213 and this instruction.
4.4. WR Launch Approval Process. 30 SW/CC is the approval authority for all launches.
Launch requests are first processed by coordinating all requirements with supporting agencies,
including JPASO member ranges. Once support agency concurrence is received, requests are
forwarded to 30 SW/CC for final approval. All missions are considered to be in a “Pending”
status until final approval is received. Only approved launches will appear on the official range
schedule. Approved launch requests are subsequently forwarded to HQ AFSPC/A3 for inclusion
on the CLSRB SLM. 2 ROPS/DOS recommendations are based on range turnaround times,
taking into account instrumentation configuration requirements necessary for transitioning from
the T-0 time of one mission type to the T-0 time of the next mission type. If launch date changes
or additions require higher headquarters approval (above JPASO), no changes are made to the
official schedule until that approval is coordinated on by 2 ROPS/CC, 30 LCG/CC, 30 OG/CC
and finally 30 SW/CC on 30 SW Form 5588, Launch Schedule Change Request. The designated
customer contacts will be informed of the final request disposition by telephone or other
appropriate means. The following figure and tables define launch request processing and range
schedule status codes and terms. Figure 4.1 depicts the overall launch request scheduling and
deconfliction process, Table 4.1 lists launch request processing stages, and Table 4.2 identifies
official launch schedule status terms.
   4.4.1. 30 SW/CC will remove unattainable (unexecutable) launch dates (e.g., placeholder
   launch dates, etc.) from the schedule if reasonable doubt exists that the launch service
   provider can achieve the scheduled launch date. WR determines whether launch dates are
   attainable using criteria such as:
       4.4.1.1. National security requirements.
       4.4.1.2. Input from launch wing units, Range Safety, or the PSM, predicated upon their
       insight into the launch program.
       4.4.1.3. Input from the launch vehicle SPO, payload SPO, etc., regarding validated
       technical or programmatic issues that would prevent the launch provider from achieving
       the launch date.
       4.4.1.4. Current contractual status.
       4.4.1.5. Current CSOSA status (if applicable).
       4.4.1.6. Current FAA licensing status (if applicable).
       4.4.1.7. Experience with the launch provider.
18                                                                                             30SWI13-203 26 AUGUST 2009


     4.4.2. Each schedule change request will be submitted on 30 SW Form 5588, Launch
     Schedule Change Request to include the below information:
        4.4.2.1. Date, time, and priority of change requested.
        4.4.2.2. Name of requester, organization, and phone number.
        4.4.2.3. Op number, vehicle payload, and location.
        4.4.2.4. Current date and new requested date in local and Zulu time.
        4.4.2.5. Reason for change and mission impact.
        4.4.2.6. Coordination will include JPASO and 2 ROPS point of contact.
        4.4.2.7. 2 ROPS/CC, 30 LCG/CC, 30 OG/CC, with final approval from 30 SW/CC.
        4.4.2.8. Return request to 2 ROPS/CCA, 606-9883 for final processing.

              determined.
* Note: “Planning” dates have no range status and will not be listed on any official WR schedules.
4.5. Associated/Related and Shadow Operations Scheduling. Associated/Related and
Shadow operations, which will run concurrently with specified primary launch operations, are
not scheduled unless prior written approval is obtained from the appropriate 2 ROPS authority.
   4.5.1. Associated/Related Operation Support. Associated/Related Operations are defined as
   any land, sea, and/or air operation, excluding internal 30th Space Wing (30 SW) or WR
   functions, that is scheduled on a non-interference basis with a ballistic, space launch, or
   aeronautical operation. The primary range user of the ballistic, space launch, or aeronautical
   operation has no direct responsibility for the associated/related operation.               All
   Associated/Related operations will be coordinated with 2 ROPS/DON IAW 2 ROPS OI 10-
   07, Procedures for Conducting Associated/Related Operations on the Western Range.
       4.5.1.1. Shadow Operation Support. Shadow operations are a form of related operations
       not defined in 2 ROPS OI 10-107. Shadow operations are defined as operations of
       certified/non- certified range equipment, typically (but not limited to ) new equipment
       being developed by SMC/LRRV under the SLRSC contract, or any other contract prior to
       delivery to the 30 SW. It includes any activity to capture, record, or distribute launch
       vehicle, payload, or ground based instrumentation data. Requests for shadow operations
       will generally be made by the government POC (SMC/LRRV or 30 RMS) to the
       appropriate PSM with final approval granted through the 2 ROPS/CC/DO. This request
       must include the purpose/objective of the related op, validation that the system to be used
       is properly accredited from a security perspective (or is standalone), and identify any
       potential impacts to the primary op. The PSM will coordinate with all the appropriate
       parties (launch agency, START Treaty Office, etc.) and consider if said operations will
       affect any previous agreements such as START requirements. Requests will include a
       rules of engagement document, for 2 ROPS/CC signature upon approval of shadow op.
       Once approval is given, a T op will be scheduled to support the shadow op. Requests for
       related operations must be provided to the PSM NLT 45 days prior to the desired op date
       for consideration.
4.6. Major Pre-launch Operations Scheduling. Requests for major pre-launch activities
support which must be completed on a specific day or within a defined time frame, which if not
completed on time would cause a launch slip (e.g., mission dress rehearsals, flight program
verification, range checks, or similar tests), must be submitted at least 30 calendar days in
advance of requirements. This is necessary so that other conflicting operations that are less time
critical can be moved without serious impact to other customers or launch missions. Critical
path milestones will receive priority over other activities as long as this will not result in
impacting other approved launch mission schedules. Other forecasted pre-launch operation
20                                                               30SWI13-203 26 AUGUST 2009


requests will be submitted no later than 1200 local time on Thursday of the week prior to
planned activities.
     4.6.1. When scheduling problems or conflicts occur it will sometimes be necessary to meet
     directly with the principles involved to resolve issues or recommend alternative solutions, as
     appropriate. Meeting participants will vary depending upon the issues involved but will
     typically include affected customer(s), range scheduling representatives, individual program
     managers, and various range technical experts as required.
4.7. MOCC Coordination. Any activity which potentially affects range systems including
construction projects, facility improvements, range maintenance, major system modifications,
new equipment installations or utility support will be coordinated through the MOCC in advance
so that impacts can be assessed and mitigated as required. Critical range system outages and/or
failures expected as a result of planned activities must be coordinated well in advance of the
project start date. Major system downtime requests will first be presented to the MOCC so that
potential issues and risks can be evaluated and mitigated as necessary before final approval by 2
ROPS/CC. Requirements must be submitted early so that contingency plans can be formulated
and viable options discussed, as appropriate.
     4.7.1. Any major maintenance request that will remove a piece of instrumentation or
     significant range infrastructure from the schedule in excess of 24 hours will be coordinated
     through 2 ROPS/CC. Maintenance downtime requests will normally come from RMS, SCS,
     or WS. The 2 ROPS/CC will coordinate the request through fellow unit commanders, as
     applicable. 2 ROPS/CC will grant schedule execution through 2 ROPS/DOS.
     4.7.2. Maintenance Resource Deconfliction. When resources are available without conflict,
     the requirement will be scheduled, as requested. If one mission preempts another, the
     MOCC will evaluate alternatives and make recommendations as appropriate. Otherwise,
     when two or more agencies request the same resource at the same time, the MOCC will
     attempt to foster an agreement between agencies to optimize resource utilization. In cases
     where agreements cannot be reached, the MOCC will provide viable alternatives based on
     the situation, official directives and existing policies. If proposed options are unacceptable, 2
     ROPS/DOS will elevate the concerns or issues to 2 ROPS leadership for resolution.
     4.7.3. Maintenance Priorities. The MOCC supports maintenance, improvement, and
     modernization (I&M) activities, with appropriate priority given in support of the long-term
     reliability and efficient range systems operation. In general, mission essential corrective
     equipment maintenance will be conducted as required to ensure range systems remain fully
     mission capable at all times.
4.8. Major Maintenance and Range Sustainment Scheduling. Planned maintenance and
major modifications involving range instrumentation systems which will prevent execution of
any or all launch missions for periods greater than 72 hours must be requested, coordinated, and
scheduled well in advance of requirements. It is recommended that major system outage
requirements be submitted to the MOCC for consideration at least 6 months in advance
whenever possible. Requests must be coordinated through the MOCC so that range and
customer impacts can be assessed and viable contingency plans formulated as necessary.
     4.8.1. Sustainment requests must minimally include the following items.
30SWI13-203 26 AUGUST 2009                                                                     21


        4.8.1.1. Date(s) requested (must include initial installation, testing and final
        certification).
        4.8.1.2. Alternate time frames in case desired dates are unavailable.
        4.8.1.3. Site status (include status of other sites that will be directly impacted by the
        action)
        4.8.1.4. Overall Status.
        4.8.1.5. Identify any limiting factors (i.e., time required to restore affected systems to
        normal operations in response to emergencies, resource or testing issues, etc.) or
        dependencies including, but not limited to, contractual agreements (can or cannot
        perform work after normal duty hours, on weekends, or related issues).
        4.8.1.6. Primary and alternate points of contact (include government and contractor
        OPRs).
        4.8.1.7. Other pertinent details as appropriate.
4.9. Site and Range Status Code Definitions . A listing of Site and Range definitions is
contained in Tables 4.3.and 4.4

* Note: Range capability is determined on a mission by mission basis, dependent upon requirements
4.10. Forecast Element. The forecast element will integrate and publish a weekly schedule of
forecasted activities including all range user requirements, internal range tests to include
maintenance, modifications, software development, pre-launch readiness tests, and other range
requirements. Future requirements scheduled beyond the current week as defined below are
considered to be planning dates. The Weekly Range Operations Schedule is finalized and
becomes firm at 1200L each Thursday for the following week. Although weekly schedules are
not finalized until the week before, all customer requirements must be submitted no later than 2
weeks prior to the needed date. Late changes (received after the 2-week deadline) will be limited
and subject to the following rules:
   4.10.1. Late schedule additions (new requests) will only be accepted when there are no
   conflicts during the requested time frame and the resources are otherwise available.
   4.10.2. The 2 ROPS/DOS weekly schedule is a listing of all range operations for a 7-day
   period starting on Sunday at 0001L through the following Saturday at 2359L.
22                                                            30SWI13-203 26 AUGUST 2009


     4.10.3. Current range scheduling information can be viewed on the World Wide Web at
     URL https://mocc.vandenberg.af.mil/. Arrangements to receive electronic copies of the
     schedule can also be made by contacting 2 ROPS/DOS directly.
4.11. Operational Status and Statistical Reporting. 2 ROPS/DOS compiles range scheduling
information in support of wing and higher headquarters reporting requirements including
daily/weekly Situation Reports (SITREP) and other periodic statistical studies. Inputs are
derived from various sources as required including approved CLSRB Space Launch Manifests,
RATS (Range Automated Tasking System), and directly from range customers.
4.12. Real Time Scheduling Element. Real Time Scheduling will provide support in response
to requests for specific documented tests requiring range and base resources to support scheduled
launch, pre-launch, and post-launch activities. Real time range support will be provided
according to mission priorities, and established safety and security criteria that are consistent
with the optimum use of support facilities and will verify that all requested support is funded
before committing resources.
4.13. Data Production Planning and Control. The scheduling office is responsible for test
data production, planning, data quality, and data delivery. Range scheduling manages all test
data production including pre-launch, launch, and special data requirements. It also coordinates
the planning, scheduling, evaluation, and delivery of test data with range users, support ranges,
and other DoD agencies. The data production schedule is normally controlled by the availability
of the data centers, which are used to produce the required data items and the data delivery times
listed in the Data Distribution Listings (DDL). Refer to Chapter 8 for detailed instructions on
identifying and/or changing data production schedules and distribution requirements.
     4.13.1. The scheduling office provides control of all real time test data production and
     interfaces with the range user on all inquiries and/or complaints.
30SWI13-203 26 AUGUST 2009                                                                   23

                         RESPONSIBILITIES AND PROCEDURES

5.1. Range Responsibilities. 2 ROPS/DOS serves as primary interface to launch customers for
range scheduling matters. The range is required to maintain an executable launch schedule as
defined by AFSPCI 10-1213, Spacelift Strategies and Scheduling Procedures.
5.2. Prerequisites for Scheduling. All range users will provide separate listings of individuals
who have been authorized to schedule launch and pre-launch activities for the customer. One
listing will include only those who are authorized to schedule launch operations. The listing
must include those individuals who have firsthand knowledge of launch activities and are
authorized to make scheduling decisions. A letter will be required from the range customer unit
commander or launch director to add, delete, or reschedule launch operations. The second listing
will contain names of individuals authorized to schedule all other range activities (excluding
launches). Authorized scheduler letters must be updated annually or when there are changes (see
Attachment 2).
5.3. Customer Scheduling Responsibilities. New scheduling representatives are invited and
highly encouraged to meet with 2 ROPS/DOS prior to scheduling operations for an orientation
into the range scheduling process. The Range Scheduling Flight can provide valuable scheduling
information and insight. The following sections describe standard scheduling procedures.
   5.3.1. Long Launch Forecasts. Range customers will submit updated forecasts of planned
   test activity to 2 ROPS/DOS at least five workdays prior to each JPASO conference and as
   requested to support CLSRB meetings. Forecasted activities will be classified in IAW
   individual Program Security Classification Guides. The forecast will also include
   information applicable to each test, such as:
       5.3.1.1. Operation Number, if assigned.
       5.3.1.2. Month, date, and time of test to be conducted.
       5.3.1.3. Program Job Order Number.
       5.3.1.4. Vehicle Type.
       5.3.1.5. Operations Directive (OD) number.
       5.3.1.6. Launch Site.
       5.3.1.7. Mobile sensor requirements.
       5.3.1.8. Impact area(s).
   5.3.2. Weekly Schedule Requests. The Weekly Schedule is a listing of firm user range
   support requirements (launch and pre-launch activities) for the next week. User requirements
   will be submitted to 2 ROPS/DOS and recorded on 30 SW Form 5587, Scheduled Operations
   Record Card, no later than 1200L on Thursday 2 weeks prior to the required date. Finalized
   schedules are normally published on the last working day of the week for the following
   week. Each schedule request will include the below information:
       5.3.2.1. Date and time test is desired.
24                                                              30SWI13-203 26 AUGUST 2009


        5.3.2.2. OD number and exceptions or additions.
        5.3.2.3. Job Order Number.
        5.3.2.4. Location (building, area, or launch site).
        5.3.2.5. 2 ROPS PSM name.
        5.3.2.6. Identity of the range user, test conductor, and individual contact telephone
        numbers.
        5.3.2.7. Associated operation number.
        5.3.2.8. In the case of pre-launch support operations, define data items required if greater
        or less than specified in the OD.
5.4. Real Time Scheduling. Control of the current week schedule including added,
rescheduled, or extended operations is the responsibility of the Real Time Scheduling Element.
Authorized scheduling representatives are required to coordinate all changes, updates,
extensions, compilations, etc., through Real Time Scheduling as soon as possible. Operations
added to the real time schedule require the same information as identified in paragraphs 5.3.2.1 -
5.3.2.8 of this instruction. Incoming requests submitted by FAX shall be confirmed by the user
via voice telephone within 15 minutes of transmission to ensure satisfactory receipt.
     5.4.1. Operational requests must comply with Chapters 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7, of EWR127-1,
     Eastern and Western Range Safety Requirements for Range users already on contract, and
     Volumes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7, of AFSPCMAN 91-710, Range Safety User Requirements for
     future Range Contractors and Users (or a waiver obtained) and all hazardous procedures must
     be approved by the Wing Safety Office (30 SW/SE).
     5.4.2. A minimum of 24-hour advance notification is required for operations requiring
     airspace coordination, Missile Operations Support, Civil Engineering, or Southern Pacific
     Railroad Trainmaster support.
     5.4.3. Scheduling requests will not be accepted when requirements conflict with other
     operations already on the schedule. Scheduled operations (except those listed as NIB) have
     scheduling priority for the date(s) and time(s) scheduled. If requested resources conflict with
     already scheduled operations users may negotiate support directly with the user involved.
     Provided all parties agree, and the range can support the agreement, the request will be
     processed. When parties do not agree, the range will offer alternative date(s) and time(s)
     depending upon resource availability.
     5.4.4. When operations are scheduled, all support listed in the OD will be committed to the
     operation except those resources deleted by the customer or deleted by mutual agreement.
     Any agency requiring instrumentation or facilities not listed in the OD must contact the PSM
     for a determination and approval before the resources can be committed. 2 ROPS/DOS will
     coordinate with appropriate 30 SW agencies, contractor offices, and support ranges when
     determining range resources availability in cases where new requirements are added. If
     support can be provided, and adequate coordination has been accomplished, requested
     resources will be scheduled. This will constitute a range commitment and authorize
     supporting agencies to issue necessary instructions.
30SWI13-203 26 AUGUST 2009                                                                    25


   5.4.5. Operation Completion Requirements. Range users are required to advise the Range
   Scheduling office whenever operations are completed. Immediately upon test completion,
   the test conductor (or person in charge of the operation) must call 606-8825 to provide
   notification the operation is complete. Calls are required whether or not test support was
   satisfactory. If problems were encountered during the operation, provide a brief unclassified
   description. This information will be recorded for historical proposes. Notify Range
   Scheduling of any changes in post-operation data requirements immediately upon completing
   each test. During non-duty hours (1600L-0700L) range users are required to provide
   completion times to Range Scheduling. During non-duty hours call Range Scheduling at
   (805) 588-9303.
5.5. Internal WR Test Scheduling. All internal range tests are scheduled through the 2
ROPS/DOS Range Scheduling Support (RSS) Office. Internal testing includes, but is not limited
to; preventive maintenance, system modifications, developmental hardware engineering/software
development, system degrades and system outages. Typical agencies scheduling internal range
tests include, but are not limited to, 30 RMS and its support contractors (e.g. WROCI) as well as
SMC/LRRV and its support contractors (e.g., SLRSC; RSA). All requests must be approved by
appropriate authorities (e.g., 30 RMS; SMC/LRRV) before they are submitted to the RSS for
processing. The RSS in turn coordinates assets requested with all support agencies prior to
submitting requests to 2 ROPS/DOS for approval. 2 ROPS/DOS will process and integrate all
range activities into the overall schedule as required to accomplish the mission. This includes
any extensions.
5.6. Launch and Hazardous Operation Safety Notifications. 2 ROPS/DOS is responsible for
providing hazardous operations safety notifications to various agencies. Mandatory safety
notifications involving land, national and international air and sea space are sent to affected
agencies and made available to the general public as required. Hazardous operation notifications
are communicated to affected agencies by official messages or letters as appropriate.
5.7. Other Range User Responsibilities. Range users shall:
   5.7.1. Provide representation at quarterly JPASO conferences and weekly MOCC meetings
   to discuss program related scheduling issues.
   5.7.2. Base Activities Notifications. Inform the Range Scheduling Office at 606-8825 when
   user scheduled base support activities (maintenance or modification to power, roads, water,
   etc.) will potentially impact unscheduled launch processing.
   5.7.3. Inform JPASO of the status of operations on the current and long range forecast as
   changes occur.
   5.7.4. Contact JPASO to relinquish unattainable launch dates as soon as information
   becomes available that indicates an approved launch date cannot be met.

                        SCHEDULES AND STATISTICAL REPORTS

6.1. Forecasts, Schedules, and Reports. The items listed below are prepared and distributed
by 2 ROPS/DOS. Agencies desiring regular or periodic forecasts, schedules, or reports must
submit written requests along with justification to 2 ROPS/DOS. Non-DoD civilian agencies
requesting these items must have the military sponsor or contract monitoring officer endorse
requirements before materials can be released. Requests and endorsements must be submitted to
2 ROPS/DOS in advance.
     6.1.1. JPASO Pacific Area Operations Forecast. This document is published quarterly. It is
     a forecast of all future launch operations and major range activities scheduled within the
     Pacific Area.
     6.1.2. JPASO Monthly Schedule Message. This message is transmitted no later than the
     fifth workday of each month and includes the combined comprehensive joint range forecast
     of Pacific Area launches and major range activities.
     6.1.3. One Year Schedule of START Accountable Launches Message. This message is
     transmitted on the 15th day of each month. It includes the One Year schedule of START
     accountable launch missions scheduled at the .
     6.1.4. Weekly Schedule Forecast. A schedule of all WR range activities covering a 7-day
     period beginning each Sunday at 0001L through the following Saturday at 2359L. Weekly
     schedules are published on the last work day prior to the week of execution.
     6.1.5. Daily Schedule. Daily WR operations schedules are distributed over the local intranet
     each workday. Operations may appear on this schedule at times differing from those
     designated in the weekly forecast due to changes in requirements. Therefore, all support
     agencies associated with test operation will review the daily schedule for final requirements.
6.2. Resource Utilization Summary. The Western Range Operations and Workload Summary,
published monthly, provides a quantitative measurement of range systems workload capacity and
the amount of work performed by these systems. This summary is generated from data that is
collected and processed within the Range Automated Tasking System (RATS) and stored in the
RATS financial section under the Range Utilization Measurement System (RUMS) module.
Requests for this document may be submitted in writing to 2 ROPS/DOS.
30SWI13-203 26 AUGUST 2009                                                                     27


                                           Chapter 7

                                 OPERATIONS SECURITY

7.1. Schedule Classification. Some programs impose security classification requirements on
activities associated with the program. Often this causes schedules to be classified. When
required, the schedules must be handled IAW DoD security directives and specific program
security classification guides. A summary of applicable security classification guidance is
usually published in individual program Operation Directives (OD).
   7.1.1. Daily and weekly schedules published by 2 ROPS/DOS are always unclassified.
   Reference to classified aspects of a program, test, or activity will be limited to the Western
   Range Operations Number, date and time of the operation, test title, and location. No other
   information regarding the classified aspects of a program will be written, discussed, or
   revealed in unclassified form.
   7.1.2. The fact that an operation has been completed does not mean an operation has been
   declassified. Detailed guidance regarding the security classification of information is
   available from individual program security classification guides. A required course of action
   is to protect the security of post-operation activities in the same manner as used prior to the
   operation, unless otherwise directed by the range user, program official, or security
   classification guide.
7.2. Operations Security (OPSEC) Practices. A great deal of “operations information,”
although unclassified, is considered “sensitive” and will be treated on a need-to-know basis.
Observations of general launch complex activities, certain correspondence and telephone calls
during routine business, and the implementation of various plans and activities related to the
conduct of operations can all be indicators for an impending operation. All personnel must be
alert to the fact that sensitive unclassified information, if freely discussed, can compromise
classified information by compilation. Information pertaining to any aspect of test operations
will not be discussed with anyone except those whose duties require the information. Strangers,
neighbors, friends, and relatives are not in this need-to-know category. Such terms as “launch”,
“firing operation”, or other terms denoting an actual operation will be avoided.
28                                                               30SWI13-203 26 AUGUST 2009


                                             Chapter 8

                   DATA PRODUCTION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

8.1. Data Production Responsibilities. A 2 ROPS/DOS Data Manager oversees WROCI
contractor management of data production planning scheduling, data evaluation, and data
delivery.
8.2. Test Data Changes. Changes to the established operations directive and data distribution
listing requirements can be made as follows:
     8.2.1. If range users wish to delete or modify data requirements prior to scheduled
     operations, the changes must be submitted in writing to 2 ROPS/DOF or 2 ROPS/DON PSM
     as appropriate. If the changes are valid, the PSM will revise documentation as necessary.
     Within 12 hours of the scheduled operation, 2 ROPS/DOS will accept emergency technical
     changes for test data and coordinate with the appropriate PSM for approval.
     8.2.2. If range users wish to delete or modify data requirements after completing a scheduled
     test, they should contact 2 ROPS/DOS. Range scheduling will coordinate all requests for
     modifications to post-operation data with the PSM. If approved, 2 ROPS/DOS will either
     take the change request directly from the user or dispatch a Data Courier to pick up the 30
     SW Form 5583, Data Request.
8.3. Data Status. Information pertaining to specific data items, such as when and how shipped,
pickup dates, special handling instructions, etc., will be provided by 2 ROPS/DOS on request.
8.4. Data Discrepancies. In the event the range user finds errors in the test data, they should
contact 2 ROPS/DOS as soon as the discrepancy is discovered and provide answers to the
following questions:
     8.4.1. Will complete replacement of data be required?
     8.4.2. Is partial replacement of discrepant data required (be specific)?
     8.4.3. Can WR have discrepant data returned? If so, when?
     8.4.4. How soon is the replacement data required?
     8.4.5. After 2 ROPS/DOS obtains the above information, a Data Request will be initiated
     directing WROCI to produce replacement data in time to meet specified data delivery times,
     when possible.
8.5. Range Data Questionnaire (RDQ). A blank Range Data Questionnaire (RDQ)
Memorandum (Attachment 3) is issued with each data package delivered to range users. The
range user is requested to provide 2 ROPS/DOF a completed RDQ within 60 days following an
operation from which unsatisfactory data was received. 2 ROPS/DOF will distribute the
returned RDQ to the applicable 2 ROPS flight for documentation control, and will track each
RDQ through the administrative cycle.
8.6. Data Requests. The 30 SW Form 5583, Data Request, is designed to provide a quick-
response method of obtaining specific data items after the range user has submitted total test data
requirements:
     8.6.1. 30 SW Form 5583 will be used:
30SWI13-203 26 AUGUST 2009                                                                        29


       8.6.1.1. To request a one-time data item for a single test.
       8.6.1.2. To obtain a special data item that was not previously identified in the original list
       of data requirements.
       8.6.1.3. To obtain follow-up data that is required because of unexpected results from
       previous tests.
       8.6.1.4. To have data tapes picked up, degaussed, and recertified, whenever magnetic
       tapes are no longer required by range users.
       8.6.1.5. To identify requirements for a data item that is not in the Standard Operational
       Data Item Manual (SODIM).
       8.6.1.6. To increase the number of copies of a data item that is specified in the OD.
       8.6.1.7. To activate delivery of data items coded “On Request” in the documentation.
       8.6.1.8. The data request will not be used to circumvent the submission of the data
       requirements IAW the Universal Documentation System (UDS).
       8.6.1.9. Data requests from aerospace contractors and recipients not identified in the
       Operations Requirements documents will not be accepted without the specific approval
       of the appropriate 2 ROPS/DOF PSM.
       8.6.1.10. Data produced in response to a data request is normally produced on a “first-in,
       first-out” basis. However mission priorities and data production center set-up may
       necessitate altering the normal production flow. Normal delivery for “routine” data
       requests is 10 days; “expedite” data requests require 5 days. However, these times are
       subject to range activity and equipment availability. In any case, 2 ROPS/DOS will
       contact the requester and negotiate an acceptable data delivery time.
8.7. Data Handling. The WR operates a Data Courier Service for the pickup and distribution of
test data. All test data deliveries on Vandenberg AFB will be made via a WR Data Courier.
Unclassified test data is shipped off base via United States Postal Service (USPS), first class
parcel post, or with customers funding Federal Express (Fed-Ex). If the test data is classified, it
is shipped as USPS first class registered mail.
8.8. Data Quality Control. The Western Range Operations Contractor performs a sample
inspection of all WR data. Normally, most data items which have been inspected, will have an
inspection stamp on the label. During the inspection process, the inspector may find some data
that has minor deficiencies in the labels, minor dropouts, or a pen failure. If there are minor
discrepancies that do not invalidate the data, the discrepancies will be identified with a Quality
Control Synopsis. If the test data recipient does not agree with the inspector’s assessment of the
data, notify 2 ROPS/DOS immediately.
8.9. Data Storage. The WR does not have the capability to store range users’ test data for more
than 365 days. Therefore, range users are required to accept permanent custody of their test data
upon delivery by a Data Courier. Request for “On Request” data must be submitted within 72
hours after completion of the test.
8.10. Test Data Planning. There are times when the quality of test data cannot be guaranteed
due to unusual test conditions. These conditions are:
30                                                              30SWI13-203 26 AUGUST 2009


     8.10.1. Engineering Test Basis (ETB) data may be available to users in the event of a launch
     anomaly, following approval by 30th Range Management Squadron, Range System Flight,
     30 RMS/RMR.
     8.10.2. Limited Commitment Basis (LCB) Data. The may commit range resources that are
     not fully developed or that have not met all acceptance criteria established by the appropriate
     range agencies in order to meet range user objectives. Any LCB system called up will be at
     the range user’s cost and the LCB data will be on a “best available basis”. Since data
     timelines and data quality cannot be guaranteed, LCB data will be delivered to the range user
     only after the approval of the PSM.
8.11. Post-launch User-Supplied Flight Parameters. The range user is required to provide
various launch “event times” to the WR within 6 hours after launch. Post-launch data processing
cannot start until the WR has the event times. These event times must be forwarded in writing
and must be signed by the government sponsor or contract monitor. If the information is
classified, it must be marked in IAW applicable security directives. Delay in providing these
launch dependent flight parameters may result in comparable delays in producing operational test
data.
8.12. Western Data Mailing Address. Any test data or operational documentation intended
for the should be addressed as follows:
     8.12.1. All CLASSIFIED data will be mailed to:
        InDyne, Inc.
        TMDL
        P.O. Box 5009
        Vandenberg AFB CA 93437
     8.12.2. All UNCLASSIFIED data will be mailed to:
        InDyne, Inc.
        DHC
        Bldg 7025, Rm. 247
        P.O. Box 5009
        Vandenberg AFB CA 93437
8.13. Availability of Scheduling Forms. 30 SW scheduling forms can be obtained by calling 2
ROPS/DOS, DSN 276-8825 or COMM (805) 606-8825 or (888) 240-1233.

Terms
Aeronautical Operations Control Officer (AOCO)—An airman who coordinates all Area
Control Center (ACC) up-range support for flight test operations, ensuring air controllers comply
with military, DoD, and FAA rules and procedures. The AOCO provides real time notification
in support of aeronautical test operations.
30SWI13-203 26 AUGUST 2009                                                                    35


Allocation of Resources—A commitment by Range Scheduling (2 ROPS/DOS) of 30 SW
resources required to support an operation. It includes, but is not limited to, instrumentation,
airspace, frequencies, support facilities, and base activities.
Associated Operation—Operation conducted to support an objective of some other major
milestone event or launch-related activity as its basic source. Associated Operations are charged
to the same account (JON) they are linked to.
Downtime—The time a system, site, or facility is not available to support Range operations.
Downtime is required for unplanned contingencies and scheduled maintenance, engineering
modification, repair, etc.
Job Order Number (JON)—An eight-digit program account number that is assigned to track
all costs incurred in support of operations scheduled at the Western Range (WR). Costs shall be
billed in accordance with DoD 7000.14-R.
Launch Operation—A complete countdown including ignition firing and lift-off of a missile or
other launch vehicle and plus-count activities.
Major Support Operation—A major milestone, pre-launch activity that requires major WR, or
other support range resources. Examples of major milestone operations include Combined
System Test (CST), Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), Mission Dress Rehearsal (MDR), and range
check.
Minor Support Operation—Any operation that does not require a major commitment of WR
instrumentation resources.
Operation—A procedure that commits resources, including (as appropriate), tracking and data
acquisition, data reduction, communications, meteorology, utilities, photography, security,
frequency management and control, and all other base support services relevant to the 30 SW
mission. This includes other ranges when range support is required beyond the nominal
boundaries or capabilities of the lead activity.
Operations Test Conductor—A range user representative who is responsible for the technical
conduct of an operation. The operations test conductor must be available at a console or
telephone during the scheduled operation.
Plus-count Activities—Activities occurring after missile or rocket lift-off (T-0).
Range Operations Schedule—The formally accepted workload schedule. The schedule is
transmitted to WR support sites daily, Monday through Friday, except federal holidays, and
officially specifies all operations supported by the WR during the current week. Specific support
questions should be directed to 2 ROPS/DOS, Real Time Section, as schedules require
continuous updating.
Range Scheduling—Range Scheduling serves as the principal point of contact with the user for
planning, execution, and coordination with other activities to obtain total support.
Range User—An agent or agency authorized to conduct operations on the WR.
Related Operation—An operation conducted to achieve an objective not associated to, but
dependent upon, a major operation for meeting planned objectives. Related operations are linked
to certain operations but charged to a different JON.
36                                                          30SWI13-203 26 AUGUST 2009


Symbiotic Operation—An association between two or more different programs running
concurrent operations that may or may not benefit each other (e.g. MDR concurrent with an F-16
operation). Symbiotic operations are charged to a different account (JON) than their linked
mission.
Western Range Operations Contractor—The contractor responsible for operations,
maintenance and sustainment.
(T-0) Time—A predetermined time period within the range user’s window at which an event
will take place, unless otherwise specified. Usually, T-0 is at the start of the operation.
Zulu Time (Z)—Also referred to as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) or Universal Time Constant
(UTC). Pacific Standard Time plus 8 hours (last Sunday in October through first Sunday in
April) or Pacific Daylight Time plus 7 hours (first Sunday in April through last Sunday in
