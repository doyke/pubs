                              BOARD PRESIDENT’S GUIDE

This guide is to assist you as the board president in ensuring the board runs smoothly and
professionally and the nominees feel good about having had quality evaluations.
A.14.1. Ensure you know the rank, name, and unit of your fellow board members.
A.14.2. Ensure the nominees’ rank and name are written on the score sheets that are provided in
your board’s packages.
A.14.3. Explain the criteria for review of the packages and ensure each board member will:
A.14.3.1. Focus on the information listed on the AF Form 1206 and score each package
accordingly.
A.14.3.2. Recognize the quantity of information provided on AF Form 1206 is not and should
not be the determining factor.
A.14.3.3. Remember the quality of information provided on AF Form 1206, for the period being
considered, is the most significant discriminator and of extreme importance.
A.14.3.4. Remember, in order to be fair and consistent in their scoring, the board MUST set
aside all prejudices and evaluate the packages in accordance with the guidelines as provided in
this instruction.
A.14.3.5. Provide an honest, objective, and unbiased review/evaluation of all nominations
continuing the integrity and credibility for which our program is noted.
A.14.4. Ensure board members score each nominee or package and provide you with their total
score.
Remind each board member to sign and date their score sheets before passing them to you.
A.14.5. Ensure you use the Board President Master Score Sheet to consolidate the information
provided by each of the board members.
A.14.6. Once they have provided you with their scores, pass them to the 71FTW/CCCE so the
scores can be entered onto the master score sheet.
A.14.7. Upon completion of the entire evaluation process, remind the board members not to
discuss their scores with each other or anyone else until after the winners are announced by the
71 FTW/CC.
A.14.8. Thank each board member for their participation and efforts in making our recognition
program a meaningful and successful one.
A.14.9. Ensure items used or pertaining to the board (score sheets, packages, pencils,
calculators, etc.) are returned to the Recognition Program Monitor, 71 FTW/CCCE, for filing or
future use.
