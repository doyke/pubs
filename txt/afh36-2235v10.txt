                                        Overview


Introduction          Instructional System Development (ISD) is the process that the
                      Air Force prescribes for planning, developing, and evaluating
                      instructional programs. This handbook explains how you can use
                      this process to produce your block of Air Force educational
                      curricula effectively and efficiently.


Introduction to ISD   This chapter describes how ISD benefits curriculum developers,
                      and how basic learning theories support the ISD decision-making
                      process.


Is this handbook      This handbook addresses the question "How do you apply the
for you?              ISD process in education?" It is applicable whether the
                      curriculum is developed by a contractor or the Air Force. But is it
                      for you?

                               Background of ISD

What is ISD?        Instructional System Development (ISD) is the official Air Force
                    process for curriculum planning. It is used to guide the design
                    and development of Air Force instruction in a systematic way. It
                    is a tool that organizes all the activities that go into course
                    development. The full ISD process carries the work of curriculum
                    development all the way from identifying a need for personnel to
                    learn a new area of knowledge or set of skills, through building
                    and teaching the course, finding out whether the students learned
                    what they needed, and improving the course to get better results.


Why use ISD?        ISD helps you produce a course or educational unit effectively
                    and efficiently. Using ISD minimizes jumping to conclusions and
                    making premature decisions about what to teach and how to
                    teach it. Even if there were no ISD process, a logical, sequential
                    process is needed to tie planning, development, execution, and
                    evaluation together. This systematic process is what any good
                    curriculum developer or instructor accomplishes, consciously or
                    unconsciously, for course planning. Accountability is a key
                    element in this process.


What does ISD do?   ISD is flexible and systematic. It can:

                       Show you how to identify what the students need to know.
                       Explain how to state what knowledge or skill students will have
                       after instruction that they did not have before.
                       Describe how to determine whether the students are learning
                       what they need to learn.
                       Explain how to organize logically the content the course will
                       cover.
                       Help you choose the most cost-effective teaching methods
                       and media for the content and the educational setting.
                       Give you the steps for developing student and instructor
                       course materials.
                       Describe scheduling and managing instruction.
                       Show you how to collect and use student test results to
                       improve the quality of the course.
                       Ensure teacher and student accountability.

How does ISD          ISD ties the whole process together with a common thread, as
work?                 follows:

                          What the students must know, to what level (requirements)
                          ties into
                          What the students must learn, to what level (objectives) ties
                          into
                          What the standards must measure, to what level (tests) ties
                          into
                          What the course teaches, to what level (design, development,
                          implementation) and
                          How successful the program is (evaluation)


Key to using ISD      ISD is a continuous process that lets you evaluate the quality of
                      your work as you proceed and avoid wasted effort. Use ISD as a
                      flexible tool to help you plan and then stay on track.


ISD meets a real      A systematic approach to course development addresses a real
need                  need. This is especially true in gathering and analyzing
                      educational requirements and in translating these requirements
                      into realistic educational experiences and integrating resources,
                      instructional techniques, and procedures into overall course
                      planning. Equally important is selecting the methods for
                      measuring instructional effectiveness through verifying changes
                      in student behavior as a result of instruction.


Education and         While ISD was designed as a generic tool, the Air Force
training              previously applied it primarily to the development of technical
                      training courses. The past problem with implementing ISD in Air
                      Force education has been that the regulations and manuals
                      governing the implementation of ISD did not make adjustments
                      for the very real differences between training and education. In
                      education, you are teaching students a body of knowledge and
                      skills to prepare them to deal with situations and solve problems
                      not yet defined.

ISD in education      The systems approach ties instruction to what the students will be
                      able to do after instruction that they could not do before.
                      Objectives in educational curricula deal largely with cognitive
                      learning (knowledge) and affective learning (attitudes) rather than
                      with psychomotor skills. You measure student success in
                      educational curricula through student performance samples that
                      can demonstrate that learning the desired subject matter and
                      attitudes has taken place.

                      This handbook illustrates how the ISD process works in the
                      development of educational curricula. The guidance in this
                      handbook will help you apply a systematic approach in your
                      curriculum development work.

                                  Section B
                     ISD and the Continuum of Education

What is the          The Continuum of Education (COE) is an educational framework,
Continuum of         a way of viewing the progress of Air Force professional education
Education            throughout an Air Force member’s career. The COE begins with
                     the first education an Air Force member receives (accession or
                     initial enlistment training and education) and continues through
                     each phase of the member’s career-long professional
                     development. The COE identifies what professional knowledge
                     and skills are needed by Air Force members at any point in their
                     careers.


Value of the         For instructional developers, the COE serves as a roadmap
Continuum of         enabling the developer to see his/her course of instruction in
Education            relation to those that precede and follow it. This provides the
                     developer an understanding of what knowledge and skills the
                     incoming student should have already acquired prior to his/her
                     course. It also gives the developer a sense of what his/her
                     course should impart to students to advance them along the
                     continuum.


Relation to ISD      In developing a course using ISD principles, the developer must
                     first determine what the instructional need is and what incoming
                     students already possess. A developer simply has to look at the
                     previous phases along the COE to determine what incoming
                     students should know and be able to do. Comparing those things
                     against the documented instructional needs allows the developer
                     to determine where his/her course must lead the student to fulfill
                     that need. This information also helps to ensure that the
                     developer doesn’t unnecessarily re-teach knowledge and skills
                     already acquired at an earlier stage in the continuum.

                ISD IN THE TOTAL INSTRUCTIONAL SYSTEM
                                      Overview


Introduction        In Air Force education, the design, development and
                    implementation of instruction takes place within the larger
                    instructional environment, which ensures that Air Force personnel
                    will receive effective and efficient high-quality instruction. This
                    environment is called the total instructional system.

                                 Air Force ISD Model

ISD models              Over the years, the ISD process has been described graphically
                        through a wide variety of models which call out the procedures in
                        a number of phases or steps. Most models encompass the
                        functions of analyzing instructional needs and designing,
                        developing, evaluating and improving instruction. The use of a
                        systematic problem-solving approach is the common thread that
                        runs through all models.


ISD is continually      The processes and products of the phases are continuously
evaluated               evaluated with emphasis on how well they meet the users' needs.
                        Life cycle evaluation ensures continuous improvement of the
                        instruction.

Description of      The Air Force model organized the ISD functions into five steps.
model               These steps are described as follows.

                    1. Analyze System Requirements.

                    This is done through occupational, job, and task analyses which
                    result in statements of actions, conditions, and standards for task
                    performances.

                    2. Define Education and Training Requirements.

                    This step includes a needs analysis to determine if training or
                    education is needed, assessment of target population
                    characteristics, and selection of tasks for instruction through
                    consideration of such factors as criticality, learning difficulty,
                    frequency of performance, and contribution to future problem
                    solving.

                    3. Develop Objectives and Tests.

                    Here the designer writes the three-part objectives that define
                    what the students will be able to do after instruction, the
                    conditions under which they will perform, and the acceptable
                    standard of performance. The designer then writes test items to
                    measure student performance on each objective.

                    4. Plan, Develop, and Validate Instruction.

                    In this step, the designer designs and produces course materials.
                    The developer tries out these materials on students using the
                    criterion test items to ensure that the students can achieve
                    course objectives.

                    5. Conduct and Evaluate Instruction.

                    Here, the course is fielded. Evaluation of instructional
                    effectiveness continues for the life of the course and identifies
                    needs that may develop for improving or updating the instruction.
AFH 36-2235    Volume 10      1 November 2002                                           13




Feedback and      Feedback: Figure 1 depicts how the ISD process uses feedback
constraints       and interaction among the four phases with double-headed
                  arrows connecting each phase of the process with the ever-
                  present evaluation function. Evaluation is what drives feedback.
                  If you don't evaluate the output of each phase of the ISD process
                  before embarking on the next phase, you may propagate errors
                  from one phase to the next and compound problems that could
                  have been easily fixed at an earlier phase. Without some type of
                  evaluation, there is no information to make decisions or to
                  provide feedback to take corrective actions.

                  Constraints: We live and work in a world bounded by a myriad
                  of constraints. Everything we do must be planned for with
                  respect to the particular constraints that bound the situation we
                  are working within. Three of the most common constraints
                  instructional developers and managers have to contend with are
                  money, manpower, and time.

                  Constrains change from project to project. Some times there
                  many be a shortage of manpower to assist in the development
                  effort. However, there may be sufficient money to permit hiring of
                  contractors to help support the project. Depending on the
                  availability of money, manpower, and time and other resources
                  that might be needed for your development project, management
                  decisions may have to be made to control the efficient and
                  effective use of the resources available for the project.

                  Constraints, especially time and manpower, also impact the
                  instructional developer. The developer must intelligently plan
                  his/her development effort to fit within the allotted time and with
                  the available manpower. If the effort will be impaired by the
                  existing constraints, he/she should raise the issue to the
                  instructional manager who has the authority to make appropriate
                  decisions.


Flexibility       The process allowed instructional designers to enter or reenter
                  the steps as necessary to develop or refine the instructional
                  system. The Air Force model worked well and was considered
                  adequate. It supported an instructional system that was focused
                  primarily on classroom education and technical training delivered
                  by an instructor using the lecture/demonstration method.
AFH 36-2235    Volume 10      1 November 2002                                        14




New concerns      Today, we are not only concerned with classroom instruction, but
                  we are also concerned with instruction that is exported to the job
                  site using new delivery methods and technologies. We are
                  concerned with new automated instructional development tools
                  that can make the instructional development more efficient,
                  building quality in our instructional system, the concept of totally
                  integrated training systems, and how to use the ISD process in
                  different applications such as systems acquisition, education,
                  aircrew, and technical training programs.


Future            Principles of ISD have themselves evolved over the past three
requirements      decades from ISD as a tool for applying behavioral learning
                  principles to classroom instruction, through models of step-by-
                  step procedures designed to enable anyone to develop
                  instruction, to sophisticated models concerned with complex
                  technological as well as cognitive issues that require experienced
                  instructional design experts to sort out.

                  Today, instructional development requires expertise not only in
                  instructional design but in media (e.g., computer hardware and
                  software, video, interactive systems), cognitive learning theory,
                  and vastly complex content areas. The scope of the expertise
                  has gone beyond the capabilities of the single instructional design
                  expert and requires the integration of several disciplines.

                  Attempts are being made to use expert system techniques to help
                  both the experts and novice instructional developers cope with
                  contemporary advancements. If successful, these techniques will
                  impact instructional design in fundamental ways, such as by
                  providing ISD expert system tools.

                  It is clear that any new model of the ISD process should reflect
                  the movement away from rigorously applied procedures and
                  should emphasize adaptability to changing environments. These
                  concerns have become cornerstones in the revision of the Air
                  Force ISD process. Updating the process will allow the Air Force
                  to meet today's need for effective and efficient instructional
                  systems and continue to meet the future challenges in
                  instructional systems development.

Purpose          Most descriptions of systems approaches to the development of
                 instruction use some kind of model to illustrate the concept. The
                 Air Force model shown in Figure 1 has been designed to
                 represent simplicity and flexibility and to avoid any implication
                 that it requires following lock-step procedures.

                 The instructional development process, which the model
                 summarizes, calls for instructional designers to:

                     Analyze and determine what instruction is needed.
                     Design instruction to meet the need.
                     Develop instructional materials to support system
                     requirements.
                     Implement the instructional system.
                     Evaluate the results of instruction to determine needed
                     improvements.

                     Total Instructional System Functions

What are system      The system functions are those that must be in place before an
functions?           educational program can operate. The basic instructional system
                     functions are discussed in the following paragraphs and are
                     depicted in Figure 2.

                     Management. This is the practice of directing and controlling all
                     aspects of the instruction process.

                     Support. This provides for and maintains the system on a day-
                     to-day and long-term basis. Examples are resources you need to
                     keep equipment functioning.

                     Administration. This is the part of management that performs
                     day-to-day tasks such as documentation, student assignments,
                     and student records.

                     Delivery. This is the means of giving students the instruction.
                     Instructors, computers, and textbooks are all examples of ways to
                     deliver instruction.

Relation to ISD      ISD is the central process of the total instructional system. ISD
                     products are integrated into the system, and the system functions
                     are active throughout all phases of the process.
AFH 36-2235    Volume 10      1 November 2002                                        18


                             Management Function


Overview          Management is the practice of directing and controlling the
                  instructional system. Never forget, however, that ISD and the
                  system functions require a total team effort. No single phase or
                  process can occur in a vacuum.


Who is            Each level within the school or responsible organization has
responsible?      certain management responsibilities. For example:

                      Faculty manage the teaching-learning activities.
                      Instructor supervisors manage the scheduling of courses.
                      Instructional designers manage curriculum development.

                  In addition, other support organizations such as Resource
                  Management and Civil Engineering manage special areas that
                  support the instructional system. Remember, it's a team effort.


Management        The basic activities of management are:
activities
                      Plan for the design, development, support, operation, and
                      maintenance of the instructional system.
                      Organize the resources, which involves identifying, arranging,
                      and bringing together resources required for the instructional
                      system.
                      Coordinate instructional system operation and support.
                      Evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of each element in
                      the instructional system.
                      Report status and progress of the development of instruction
                      or operation of the instructional system.
AFH 36-2235    Volume 10       1 November 2002                                       19


                                Support Function


Overview          The support function is defined as those long-range, as well as
                  day-to-day, tasks performed in order to implement, operate, and
                  maintain an instructional system. Some of the basic support
                  activities include:

                      Supply equipment, parts, materials.
                      Maintain equipment, facilities.
                      Produce instructional materials.
                      Construct instructional aids, facilities.
                      Provide funding, services.


Who is            As with the other instructional system functions, managers have
responsible?      the responsibility of ensuring that the instructional systems are
                  adequately supported for the life cycle of the system. Support for
                  the instructional system will be provided by such organizations
                  as:

                      Civil Engineering.
                      Resource Management.
                      Contracting.
                      Visual Services.
                      Information Management.

                  These are only a few of the many support organizations that will

                              Administration Function


Overview            Administration is the part of management that performs day-to-
                    day tasks such as:

                        Maintain documentation.
                        Type reports.
                        Keep equipment, supply, and other records.
                        Maintain student records.


Administrative      The basic administrative activities that support the instructional
activities          system are:

                        Provide documents, such as instructional standards, plans of
                        instruction, and student workbooks.
                        Maintain records, such as personnel and instructional
                        equipment.
                        Administer student support, such as processing students "in"
                        and "out" of the site.
                        Administer staff support, such as leave processing and
                        maintenance of personnel programs.
                        Ensure that copyright issues are resolved and permissions
                        granted.
                        Schedule resources, such as personnel, equipment and
                        facilities.
                        Monitor resources, such as equipment and funds.


Who is              Managers have the responsibility of ensuring that the
responsible?        administrative activities are performed in support of the
                    instructional system. However, various instructional
                    organizations have specific responsibilities to support system
                    operation. For example, some of the organizational elements
                    that may be engaged in administration are:

                        Registrar.
                        Typing pool.
                        Staff support elements.
                        Student support elements.
                        Information management.
                        Contracting agent.

                                  Delivery Function


Overview             The instructional system delivery function is the means by which
                     instruction is provided to the students. Examples of delivery
                     methods are:

                        Workbooks.
                        Instructors.
                        Computers, which includes ICW, CAI, CMI.
                        Training devices, including simulators and games.
                        Satellites.
                        Correspondence.


Who is               The individuals responsible for the instructional delivery function
responsible?         are:

                        Managers - Ensure that adequate planning and analysis have
                        been done prior to selecting the delivery method and, once
                        the method is selected, see that it is supported.
                        Instructional designers - Select the most appropriate delivery
                        method(s).
                        Instructional staff - Use and evaluate the selected delivery
                        method(s) for effectiveness.


Ensuring readiness   At this point, the delivery function should be fully developed and
                     operational. Validation will have indicated the suitability and
                     readiness of the delivery system; however, prior to implementing
                     the instructional system, you should "check it out" to be sure that
                     everything is ready. You need answers to questions about the
                     delivery function, such as:
                         Are there adequate instructors to support the instructional
                         requirements?
                         Have the instructors been qualified, and are they certified to
                         deliver the instructions?
                         Are the student materials available and printed in adequate
                         numbers?
                         Is the necessary equipment available and operational such as
                         computers, projectors, simulators?
                         Has the programming of the ICW been completed?
                         Have slides and/or transparencies been produced?
                         Have guest speaker invitations been mailed?

Overview         Evaluation is an ever-present function in the ISD process that
                 requires the continuous identification, collection and analysis of
                 data from an instructional program or a course to determine its
                 value or worth as outlined by the institution's mission and goals.
                 Evaluation is focused around four basic questions:

                 (1) Did learning take place (in terms of a change in cognitive
                     knowledge),

                 (2) Were students' attitudes affected by their learning
                     experience,

                 (3) Did a change in behavior take place, and

                 (4) Did the learning (cognitive and behavioral changes) cause
                     the student's organization to be come more efficient and/or
                     effective?

                 These questions embody four levels of evaluation, each of which
                 characterizes a different aspect of the instructional program.

                     Level 1 - Student learning
                     Level 2 - Student attitudes about the course
                     Level 3 - Behavioral changes in the student
                     Level 4 - Changes in graduate's job performance

                 The evaluation function is covered in more detail in Chapter 8 of
                 this volume.

                                   PLANNING
                                     Overview


Introduction       Planning the instructional system structure and functions includes
                   determining ISD process management and evaluation strategies,
                   and estimating resource requirements and constraints.

                   The instructional developer may be responsible for doing some of
                   the preliminary planning activities, given input from management,
                   or the planning decisions may have been made by another Air
                   Force organizational level.

                   This chapter describes the planning activities that are an inherent
                   part of each step and function, including the three levels or
                   phases in designing instructional systems.

                       The first is the "system level." Planning and analysis at this
                       level focuses on needs, goals, priorities, resources,
                       constraints, alternate delivery systems, etc. The focus is on
                       determining the scope and sequence of courses and delivery
                       system design –– the "big picture."

                       The second level is the "course level." Planning and analysis
                       at this level is on course objectives, course structure, and
                       sequence.

                       The third is "lesson level." In most settings, curriculum
                       developers will find themselves working to some degree at all
                       three levels. The key difference in the work done is the
                       number and/or detail of decisions that have already been
                       made when you enter a given level.

                                 Section A
               Determine Instructional Requirements / Needs

Introduction          An important preliminary activity that takes place before entering
                      the ISD process is to determine that there is a need for formal
                      instruction to achieve a mission goal. Assessing instructional
                      need is a critical activity that should be taken before any other
                      planning occurs or additional resources are committed to a
                      project.


Definitions of need   The term "need" has several definitions (Stufflebeam, 1985). The
                      definitions most often used are:

                         Discrepancy view. A need is the difference between "what
                         is" and "what should be." In this definition, the difference
                         between what "is being taught" and what "should be taught" is
                         the discrepancy.
                         Democratic view. Needs are identified by a group of experts
                         (instructional designers, project managers, and others) who,
                         by the democratic process of majority rule, determine what
                         changes need to be made to the instruction.
                         Diagnostic view. Need is determined by identifying
                         concepts, principles, and procedures whose absence or
                         deficiency would hamper the students in meeting job
                         performance requirements.
                         Analytic view. Need is determined by accurately predicting
                         the future instructional needs based on the current
                         instructional situation.


What is an            Instructional need is the lack of skills, knowledge and attitudes
instructional need?   personnel should have in order to perform an activity adequately.

                      Examples of types of skills, knowledge and attitudes personnel
                      may not have are:

                         Behavioral - skills in using tools and test equipment
                         Cognitive - knowledge of information
                         Affective - commitment to a particular belief
AFH 36-2235        Volume 10      1 November 2002                                         26




Who determines a      Instructional developers can receive a statement of instructional
requirement?          need from any Air Force organizational level. Many such
                      statements come from Air Staff or a cognizant office in HQ USAF.


What establishes      Instructional needs will be present when:
instructional
requirements?             A problem surfaces in an area where there is no current
                          instruction.
                          Policy or doctrinal changes make existing instruction obsolete.
                          A new force structure is planned.
                          Instruction in a topic is mandated.


Stages of             The four stages involved in assessing instructional needs are:
assessing
instructional needs       Plan the assessment.
                          Define the problem.
                          Document the deficiency.
                          Develop the solution.


How to do it          Instructional needs assessment is the means of identifying
                      whether there is a need to develop or revise instruction to solve
                      an identified problem. The steps of instructional needs
                      assessment are shown below.

                       Determine Personnel Requirements

Purpose                The purpose of determining personnel requirements is to ensure
                       that you know what personnel you will need to design, develop,
                       implement, and maintain the course.


What is required?      In determining personnel requirements, you will:

                           Determine the level of the course.
                           Identify the need for specialists.
                           Define the roles of the specialists.
                           Plan adequate education for instructors.


Type and level of      The type of course and level of complexity of the course will
the course             determine the personnel requirements. For example:

                           Developing an exportable course using interactive courseware
                           (ICW) will require more personnel, using different skills, than
                           will print-based materials.
                           Levels of complexity within computer-based training (CBT) will
                           impact personnel requirements, since the more complex the
                           material is, the more time it takes to design and develop.
                           Topic integration across the course may require additional
                           personnel or personnel with broader education and
                           experience areas.

                       initial planning stages.


Identifying need for   The type and level of the course will drive personnel

                           Content specialists
                              Identify the kind and number of specialists.
                              List any special skills the specialists may need.
                              Estimate when specialists will be needed and for how

                                  Section C
                      Evaluating Your Development Effort

Introduction          The ISD process is a cyclic, self-correcting process. How well
                      the self-correction nature of the process works depends to a large
                      extent on how well the instructional developer evaluates his/her
                      progress through the ISD process. The most effective curriculum
                      development effort is one which has a well-planned and
                      deliberate evaluation process built into the design. This is
                      something the instructional developer must address early in the
                      development process and continuously throughout the
                      development cycle.


What needs to be      You should evaluate your progress at each phase of the process.
evaluated             So, at the end of each chapter of this handbook describing one of
                      the ISD phases, you will find a section discussing what is
                      important to be evaluated at that phase.

                      After the instructional program is developed, it needs to be
                      evaluated as a total instructional system to ensure all the parts
                      work together as intended. This is known as validation or
                      summative program evaluation. At this point, the course is ready
                      to go "full up."

                      Then, after the instructional program is in place, the evaluation
                      phase is invoked at the completion of each course administration.
                      This allows for data collected during the conduct of the course to
                      be analyzed. This analyzed data is then fed back into the design
                      process to correct shortcomings of the program and to generally
                      improve the course.


Evaluation plan job   Some course developers and program evaluators feel
aid                   comfortable having a plan of attack laid out for them to follow
                      during and after the course development process. For those who
                      prefer it, here is a job aid useful for developing an evaluation
                      plan.

                                  ANALYSIS
                                    Overview


Introduction      The analysis phase begins when the requirement for instruction
                  has been established. This phase covers a variety of analyses,
                  which may include mission or content analysis, learning analysis,
                  resource analysis, target audience analysis, etc.

                  You will check the results of the analyses against the preliminary
                  evaluation plan for this ISD project and update the plan as
                  needed. The individual(s) charged with managing the
                  instructional development effort must update the initial
                  management plan to reflect any scheduling and other
                  adjustments.


Purpose           The purpose of the analysis is to identify what to teach and how
                  much to teach.

                  At the "big picture" level, some analysis established the need for
                  instruction. For example, in the mid 1990s, a determination was
                  made that Air Force officers required a stronger foundation in Air
                  Force Doctrine, especially officers serving on joint and CINC
                  staffs. This established the educational requirement for a new
                  course to be developed at Air University: the Aerospace Power
                  Course. It also established the initial target population for the
                  course: all Air Force officers of the rank of major or higher
                  assigned to positions on joint and CINC staffs.

What you do        At your level, the big picture analysis has been done and the
                   mission or major objective has been stated. Your job is to
                   investigate the factors that will tell you what and how much
                   instruction you need to develop. These factors include:

                       Why the students will need the information or skills (mission or
                       goal).
                       What skills, knowledge, and attitudes the students must
                       master and what categories of learning this involves (learning
                       analysis).
                       What resources you have to work with and what your
                       constraints are (resource analysis).
                       Who the students will be and what they already know about
                       the subject (target audience analysis).


Objective          The objective of this chapter is to explain the various types of
                   analyses that may be conducted in the analysis phase.

                             Educational Analysis

Introduction        Normally, the analysis phase begins with an educational analysis.
                    The requirement to conduct this form of analysis may depend on
                    the application, scope, and nature of the project. This level of
                    analysis identifies the goals and content area of an educational
                    requirement. A needs assessment should already have been
                    conducted to determine if there is a problem for which instruction
                    is the appropriate solution. (Refer to Volume 6 of AFH 36-2235
                    for further guidance.) If the assessment confirmed an
                    instructional need, you would usually begin instructional
                    development at the analysis phase. However, in some cases,
                    you may be able to enter directly into the design phase of ISD.
                    This section addresses the first stage of analysis.


Why analyze?        The initial analysis of the educational requirement provides you
                    with information needed to begin to determine instructional
                    requirements.


Definition          Educational analysis is the process of reviewing the educational
                    requirements, developing the educational goals or outcomes, and
                    developing statements of these goals.


Who is              Managers are responsible for ensuring that the necessary
responsible?        analyses are conducted. In most cases, other individuals such as
                    instructional developers, subject matter experts (SMEs), or
                    system analysts should conduct the actual analyses or at least
                    provide technical assistance.


How to conduct      The process of conducting an analysis involves a number of
the analysis        steps. The actual number may depend on the type and scope of
                    the analysis being conducted. During the analysis, you may
                    perform some of the steps concurrently, others sequentially.

                        Collect data.
                        Determine and state the learning outcomes.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 10      1 November 2002                                       37




How to conduct           Determine the learning content, e.g., skills and knowledge.
the analysis             Prioritize the outcomes in terms of importance to mission
(Continued)              goals.
                         Document the results.


Sources of data      Some sources of data are:

                         Subject matter experts.
                         Subject matter literature.
                         Air Force directives.
                         Department of Defense directives.
                         Previous course evaluation data "lessons learned" (for course
                         revisions).


Results              The results of the educational or mission analysis are statements
                     of the course goals that will be the focal point for developing and
                     organizing the instruction. Statements of learning objectives,
                     learning hierarchies, and measures of success in learning will all
                     be directly traceable back to the overall course or program goals.
AFH 36-2235         Volume 10        1 November 2002                                     38

                                     Learning Analysis

Definition             Learning analysis is the process of analyzing what is to be taught
                       in terms of types of learning involved and level of learning
                       desired.


Learning analysis      When you conduct a learning analysis, you will:
steps
                           Identify the types of learning involved.
                           Determine the level of learning needed.
                           Build a learning hierarchy of knowledge and skills to be taught.
                           Identify prerequisite knowledge and skills required.


Conducting             In learning analysis, the curriculum developer looks directly at
learning analysis      categorizing type and level of learning needed to satisfy the
                       instructional goal. Statements of outcomes are generally made in
                       terms of cognitive and affective behaviors expected.


Use of learning        You will use the results of the learning analysis to design
analysis results       instruction. Identifying the types and levels of learning will help
                       define how the objectives will be stated. The learning hierarchy
                       will support sequencing instruction. Establishing prerequisites will
                       help determine what content must be included in the course.


Example                The following example of learning analysis procedures is
                       provided for your information. Although not complete, it is an
                       excellent guide for the procedures to follow.

                                         Multiple levels may be necessary if an
                                         educational goal refers to several content
                                         areas. For example, if the goal is to
                                         comprehend some complex concept, and if
                                         the students are not assumed to possess
                                         the required background factual knowledge
                                         to ensure their comprehension, then you
                                         must teach the necessary factual knowledge
                                         at a fairly low level of learning (knowledge
                                         level), followed by instruction on the
                                         complex concept at the comprehension level
                                         of learning.
                                         Multiple levels may also be necessary if an
                                         educational goal refers to different learning
                                         domains. For example, if the goal is to
                                         comprehend some concept and to value that
                                         concept, then it will be necessary to
                                         recognize two different levels of learning–
                                         one in the cognitive domain
                                         (comprehension) and one in the affective
                                         domain (value).


                                    In line with the above example, you must
                                    intentionally consider both cognitive and
                                    affective purposes for instruction. You will
                                    probably never create a completely affective
                                    instructional program. However, it is just as
                                    unlikely that you will completely ignore the
                                    affective component of instruction. The
                                    combination of cognitive and affective
                                    components in the instructional process is one of
                                    the attributes that distinguishes education from
                                    training.
AFH 36-2235           Volume 10      1 November 2002                                           40




Types of learning        There are many ways to categorize types of learning. Some of
                         the most common are briefly discussed below.


Intellectual skills      Intellectual skills consist of discrimination, concept, rule-using and
                         problem-solving capabilities.


Cognitive                Cognitive strategies are thought of as executive control
strategies               mechanisms for learning. There are different types of cognitive
                         strategies, such as clustering items into similar groups to reduce
                         memory loss, or reading strategies to increase comprehension.


Verbal information       Verbal information is the learning of names and labels that can be
                         verbalized. It is also called declarative knowledge. Verbal
                         information learning requires some basic language skills. It is
                         most readily learned and retained when situated within a larger
                         context.


Motor skills             Motor skills are learned behaviors that involve the smooth,
                         coordinated use of muscles. Motor skills most often involve a
                         sequence of activities that is first learned verbally to provide
                         guidance for learning execution of the motor skill. When the
                         learner has acquired the motor skill, the verbal routine is no
                         longer needed and the skill is performed in a smooth and
                         continuous manner.


Attitudes                Attitudes are an area where affective and cognitive learning
                         overlap. The acquisition of particular attitudes may require prior
                         learning of intellectual skills and particular sets of information.


Other learning           Other means of categorizing learning have been in common use
categories               in Air Force curriculum development. Some of these are listed
                         below and on the following page.

                         Forming Associations. Associate, name, or respond to a
                         specific input (stimulus). The person associates the response
                         with a specific input only. The response may be vocal, sub-vocal
                         (say it to yourself), written or motor.

                         Forming Chains. Recall sequences of actions or procedures
AFH 36-2235      Volume 10       1 November 2002                                          41


                     which must be recalled in a specific order. In a chain, the
                     response to one input becomes the input to the next response.


                     This may involve chains of verbal responses or chains of motor

categories
(Continued)          Making Discriminations. Make different responses to the
                     various members of a particular class; it means being able to
                     distinguish among input information sources and/or types and
                     then to respond appropriately to each.

                     Making Classifications. Respond in a single way to all
                     members of a particular class of observable or abstract events.
                     This involves recognizing the essential similarity among a class of
                     objects, people, events or abstractions, and recognizing the
                     differences that separate those objects, people, events, or
                     abstractions which are not members of the class.

                     Using Rules. Apply rules to a given situation or condition by
                     responding to a class of inputs with a class of actions. A rule
                     states the particular relationship between two or more simpler
                     concepts. It is helpful to think of rules as "if-then" statements.

                     Problem-Solving. Compare previously learned rules to create a
                     higher order rule.


Higher-level         For higher-level education, you may have to:
education
                        Evaluate conflicting information.
                        Synthesize disparate data or perspectives.


Levels of learning   The following categories of learning levels are in common use for
                     cognitive and affective learning. With cognitive learning, concern
                     is focused on what is going on in the learner's mind. Affective
                     learning has to do with attitudes and motivation.
AFH 36-2235   Volume 10     1 November 2002                                      42




Cognitive        Knowledge: Recall previously learned material (facts, theories,
                 etc.) in essentially the same form as taught.
                 Comprehension: See relationships, concepts, and abstractions
                 beyond the simple remembering of material. This typically
                 involves translating, interpreting, and estimating future trends.
                 Application: Use learned material in new and concrete
                 situations, including the application of rules, methods, concepts,
                 principles, laws and theories.
                 Analysis: Break down material into its component parts so that
                 the organizational structure may be understood. This includes
                 identification of the parts, analysis of the relationships between
                 parts, and recognition of the organizational principles involved.
                 Synthesis: Put parts together to form new patterns or structures,
                 such as a unique communication (a theme or speech), a plan of
                 operation (a research proposal), or a set of abstract relations
                 (schemes for classifying information).
                 Evaluation: Judge the value of material for a given purpose.
                 Learning in this area is the highest in the cognitive hierarchy
                 because it involves elements of all the other categories, plus
                 conscious value judgments based on clearly defined criteria.


Affective        Receiving: Be aware that a thing exists and pay particular
                 attention to it.
                 Responding: React to a particular phenomenon in some way,
                 such as acquiescing (reading assigned material), willingness to
                 respond (voluntarily reading beyond assignment), or satisfaction
                 in responding (reading for pleasure).
                 Valuing: Attach worth or value to any object, phenomenon, or
                 behavior ranging from accepting a value to commitment.
                 Organizing: Bring together different values, including conflicts
                 between them, and then begin to build an internally consistent
                 value system.
                 Characterizing: Pervasive, consistent, and predictable behavior

                                  Resource Analysis

Introduction           Resources are critical factors in the instructional system from the
                       initial planning, through instructional development, to operation
                       and maintenance of the system. In the analysis phase, it is
                       unlikely that the exact resource requirements can be defined, but
                       if you consider resource requirements in early planning efforts,
                       you should be able to estimate the requirements and have
                       enough time to secure the resources.


Resource               Resources for the instructional system include:
categories
                           Equipment.
                           Facilities.
                           Funds.
                           Personnel.
                           Time.


What you need to       Resources should be analyzed in order to identify:
know
                           Type of resources you will need to develop the course, such
                           as instructors, equipment, facilities, designers.
                           Quantity of resources required, such as number of instructors,
                           number of work-hours (i.e., faculty/student ratios).
                           When resources will be needed in order to meet scheduled
                           delivery date.
                           Total cost of resources for in-house or contract development.
                           Resource constraints.


Scope of resource      The scope of resource analysis includes both long-range and
analysis               day-to-day concerns.


Conducting             The resource analysis results in an estimate of resource
resource analysis      requirements for the instructional program for both development
                       and operation. One of the simplest ways to conduct the initial
                       resource analysis is to ask a series of questions to determine
                       what resources will be needed to support the objectives,
                       understanding that this is an estimate. Sample resource
                       categories and questions are suggested in the following table.

                 Equipment              What specific equipment will you need
                                        (e.g., computers)?
                                        How will the equipment be used in the
                                        course?
                                        What quantities will be required?
                 Facilities             How much space will be required? What
                                        type?
                                        Are facilities available?
                                        Are there special environmental
                                        requirements?
                 Funds                  What will the initial personnel, equipment,
                                        and facilities cost?
                                        What are the recurring costs associated
                                        with the system?
                 Personnel              How many instructional designers,
                                        computer programmers, videographers, are
                                        needed to develop the course?
                                        Will instructors be needed? If so, how
                                        many?
                                        What are the student work-year
                                        requirements?
                 Time                   What is the scheduled delivery date?
                                        How much time will be required to develop
                                        the instruction?
                                        What is the estimated module or course
                                        length?

                 Finding answers to these and other questions will help you
                 estimate the resource requirements for the instructional program.
AFH 36-2235     Volume 10       1 November 2002                                          46




Resource            If you are faced with a resource constraint, you will need time to
constraints         select an alternative to some planned strategy or delivery
                    approach.

                    Remember that any instruction, whether a topic within an existing
                    course or a complete course, is always a sub-element of a larger
                    system. Also, the course has such constraints as maximum
                    course length, manpower, budget, and student loading, all of
                    which are driven by the agencies that use the graduates of the
                    course. Ignoring these constraints may lead to an instructional
                    package that is either too large for the time allotted, or one that
                    requires too large a share of resources compared to the relative
                    importance of the course to the overall missions of the Air Force.


Updating resource   During initial planning and analysis, it is unlikely that you can
requirements        completely and accurately identify all resources you will need. As
                    the instructional development process continues, there will be a
                    continuing need to update the resource requirements to ensure
                    that adequate resources are available for your instructional
                    program.

                              Target Audience Analysis

Purpose              Conducting an analysis of the target audience allows you to
                     design the instructional system based on the knowledge and
                     attitudes the target audience is likely to bring to the course. This
                     reduces the likelihood of a mismatch between the students and
                     the level of course content.


Products of          Target audience analysis produces various data depending on
analysis             the nature and scope of the analysis. Examples of the data
                     produced are:

                         Range of aptitudes.
                         Previous background and experiences.
                         Previous education.
                         Interests.
                         Physical characteristics.
                         Size of target audience.
                         Computer literacy.
                         Supervisory experience.
                         Rank/grade.
                         Command experience.
                         Subject matter competence.
                         Writing proficiency.


Use of the data      The data produced during analysis of the target audience results
                     in a typical student profile and is used by the instructional
                     designer to determine:

                         Course content.
                         Level of course content.
                         Media.
                         Delivery methods.
                         Course length.
                         Equipment needs.

                               Section E
              What and How to Evaluate in the Analysis Phase

What to consider      Take into account the following points:

                          Ask someone who is not involved in the course development
                          effort, but who is knowledgeable in the content to be taught, to
                          review the data sources used in the Educational Analysis to
                          ensure all relevant subject matter experts and appropriate
                          directives have been consulted.

                          Ask someone who is not involved in the course development
                          effort, but who is knowledgeable in learning theory, to review
                          your learning analysis as a "sanity check."

                          Review the resource analysis with one or more individuals not
                          involved in the course development effort who have a good
                          sense of resource requirements to validate the assumptions
                          on which your analysis was based.

                          Review your target audience analysis to ensure you have
                          given appropriate credit to your audience for previous
                          knowledge, skills, abilities, and attitudes they bring into your
                          instructional situation. It may be helpful to consult the
                          Continuum of Education architecture to help validate your
                          assumptions.

                        ISD Management Plan Update

Project             During your initial planning of the ISD project, the managers
management          developed an ISD management plan to serve as a road map for
                    managing the instructional development process and the
                    instructional system. You developed the plan early in the initial
                    planning stages to plan how you are going to get where you are
                    going. As you complete the analysis phase of the ISD project,
                    you will likely have gathered additional and better information on
                    which to base your management decisions. If this is the case,
                    you will need to update the management plan.


Purpose             Since the management plan is a "tool" for managing the
                    instructional development process and the instructional system,
                    update it at the end of each phase of instructional development,
                    or when any significant change occurs that impacts planning. If
                    the plan is not continually updated with the most current, accurate
                    information, it will fail as a management tool.


Who is              The ISD project manager is responsible for seeing that the
responsible?        management plan is updated at the end of each phase of ISD, or
                    after any significant change has occurred that impacts the current
                    planning.


What should be      The ISD management plan should be updated after each phase
updated?            of instructional development, as applicable. Update the plan to
                    include the latest information, such as:

                        New or revised milestones.
                        Refinements to project definition.
                        Changes in project resource requirements or constraints.
                        Revisions to support requirements.
                        Identification of new taskings.
                        New information resulting from analysis that impacts project
                        management.

Introduction       At this point in the process, you have completed the required
                   analyses and updated the evaluation and management plans.
                   You are now ready to enter the design phase of ISD.


What is it?        The design of instruction defines:
                     What exactly your course will teach.
                     How you will measure what the students learn.
                     How you will teach the material.
                     How the school will implement the course.
                     How you will collect and maintain student and course data.

                   In addition, you will check:
                       How the design affects the evaluation plan
                       Management plan adjustments


Objectives         The objectives of this chapter are to:
                     Explain how ISD supports cognitive and affective instructional
                     design.
                     Review method and media selection.

Introduction          The first activity in the design phase is to develop objectives.

                      developed at all levels of instruction where evidence of learning is
                      required.


Definition            An objective is a statement of what students are expected to
                      demonstrate as a result of instruction. Objectives are usually
                      used to identify outcomes of units, blocks, modules, instructional
                      periods, and areas of instruction such as courses of a few days.


Purpose               Some of the purposes of an objective are to:

                         Serve as the foundation for instructional design.
                         Provide the basis for instructional strategy decisions.
                         State expected student behaviors.
                         Determine content of the instruction.
                         Serve as a basis for developing test items and performance
                         appraisals.
                         Demonstrate student accountability.
                         Validate instruction.


Goals vs.             Educational objectives are not to be confused with educational
objectives            goals, which are published outcomes of instruction in terms of
                      broad intent, state, or condition. When educational goals are
                      published, there are usually several educational objectives
                      published that serve as evidence of achievement of the broadly
                      stated goal.


Types of objectives   Terminal objectives are usually designed to identify required
                      learning outcomes at the end of major divisions of a course, such
                      as a module, unit, or block. However, terminal objectives may be
                      written for stand-alone periods of instruction. Objectives for short
                      courses or content involving numerous small areas not related
                      are usually stated as terminal objectives. Terminal objectives are
                      also known as primary objectives.

Types of objectives   Developmental objectives are prerequisite outcomes that form
(Continued)           the building blocks necessary to achieve a terminal objective.
                      These objectives provide the opportunity to evaluate student
                      progress toward the terminal objective, but do not serve as proof
                      of achieving the terminal objective. Developmental objectives are
                      also known as enabling, secondary, supporting, and/or
                      subordinate objectives.


Formats for           Level of learning objectives contain a specific level of learning
objectives            and a clearly stated subject expressed in terms of what students
                      are expected to achieve, such as comprehend the concepts of
                      discipline and non-judicial punishment. Level of learning objec-
                      tives represent a large domain of behaviors at a specific level of
                      proficiency. Curriculum designers must carefully select
                      representative, measurable samples of behavior (MSB) from the
                      domain of behaviors that will serve as evidence of objective
                      achievement. MSBs are the basis for constructing written test
                      items or performance appraisals. They may be written in the
                      format that possesses all the criteria of a criterion objective, such
                      as behavior, conditions, and standards, or published as
                      behavioral statements only.

                      Criterion objectives are statements that specify precisely what
                      student behavior is expected. Complete criterion objectives are
                      made up of three parts:

                         Behavior(s) - What the students will be able to do (for
                         example, list the names of the Joint Chiefs of Staff).
                         Condition(s) - Environment in which they will do it (for
                         example, using student manuals, list the names of the
                         commanders of each MAJCOM and special operating
                         activities).
                         Standard(s) - How well they will do it in order to demonstrate
                         that they have learned (for example, "... list the names ...
                         within ten minutes”).

                      Activity statements or expressive outcomes are planned
                      activities that have no explicit or precise objectives (Eisner,
                      1985). These statements are appropriate, especially in short,
                      standardized programs, for presentations where the content is
                      changing so rapidly that a formalized objective, lesson plans and
                      measurement devices are inappropriate. An activity statement
AFH 36-2235       Volume 10      1 November 2002                                       53




Formats for           might read, "Participate in an interchange with company grade
objectives            officers to discuss problems and perceptions in today's military
(Continued)           environment." The use of activity statements must be fully
                      justified and occupy a very small percentage of the total
                      curriculum. These types of statements are usually used for large
                      group presentations, but may be used in small group settings
                      also.


Stating objectives    The three major categories of learning outcomes–cognitive,
for different types   affective, and psychomotor–require somewhat different
of learning           approaches to stating objectives.
outcome
                         Cognitive level-of-learning objectives require measurable
                         samples of behavior verbs that serve as observable,
                         measurable evidence of a more general mental activity such
                         as know, comprehend, or apply.

                         Affective level-of-learning objectives require measurable
                         samples of behavior verbs that serve as observable,
                         behavioral evidence of a more general feeling state such as
                         receive, respond or value.

                         Psychomotor objectives use verbs that describe observable
                         actions usually associated with a process or procedure
                         involving manipulative skills, such as assembles, measures,
                         alters and dissects.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 10       1 November 2002                                        54




Objectives in        Instructional objectives in the educational area usually fall in the
education            cognitive or affective taxonomy of learning. Cognitive objectives
                     focus on basic knowledge, concepts and principles, and cognitive
                     skills which include the application, analysis, synthesis, and
                     evaluation of principles or generalizations. Affective objectives
                     focus on voluntary student attending, receiving, responding, and
                     valuing, usually at the acceptance and preference levels.
                     However, few educational objectives are published at the
                     attending, receiving, or responding level for adults.

                     Affective objectives at the commitment level of valuing and higher
                     levels are seldom published except for courses or schools of
                     several years in duration, or when concepts or principles are
                     threaded through several schools over many years across a
                     continuum of education, such as ethical principles, leadership
                     concepts, etc.


Measuring            Since cognitive and affective objectives in education cover a
cognitive and        large domain of behaviors, a sampling of behaviors from the
affective behavior   larger domain is accepted practice. Careful consideration should
change               be given to selection of behaviors that provide significant
                     evidence of achievement of a more general and abstract
                     outcome.

                      Guidelines for Developing Objectives


The process        When the overall course goal or mission statement has been
                   agreed upon, that statement becomes the focal point for all
                   course development that follows.


Area goals or      Area goals or objectives divide the curriculum at the top level.
objectives         Area goals describe expected outcomes in terms of broad,
                   general intent. Area goals do not generally use specific levels of
                   learning in order to avoid confusion with educational objectives.
                   Area objectives, when published, should exhibit the
                   characteristics of a level-of-learning objective or criterion
                   objective. Area objectives published as level-of-learning
                   outcomes should be followed by an adequate number of
                   measurable samples of behavior.


Phase (Block)      Phase objectives, also known as block or module objectives, are
objectives         major subdivisions of an area and the first level of detail beneath
                   the area goal or objective. Phase objectives published as level-
                   of-learning objectives should be followed by an adequate number
                   of measurable samples of behavior.


Period (Unit)      Each area objective and phase objective (if used) is, in turn,
objectives         divided into a series of instructional periods. Period objectives
                   are more specific than area or phase objectives. In the period
                   objectives, you decide on the learning activities.

                   Period objectives published as level-of-learning objectives should
                   be followed by an adequate number (three or four) of measurable
                   samples of behavior to state specific desired student outcomes.

                   Selecting the behavioral performance statement appropriate for a
                   given level of learning will enable students to demonstrate clearly
                   the desired observable behavior. You need to look at the total
                   context of the behavioral statement to determine the level of the
                   sample, not just at the verb used.

                   Cognitive and affective levels of learning with corresponding
                   behavioral verbs for stating specific learning outcomes are listed
                   in the following tables.
AFH 36-2235         Volume 10        1 November 2002                                       57




Level of learning      Cognitive
objective verbs
                       Note: The same verbs may be used to describe multiple learning
                       levels or learning tasks, because they identify what the learner is
                       to do with the content. The nature of the content to be learned
                       helps determine the learning level or task. For example, see the
                       verb “Describe” identified in levels 1 and 3, or “Relate” in levels 4
                       and 5, or “Differentiate” in levels 3 and 4, etc.

                       1. Knowledge. The recall of previously learned material (facts or
                          theories) in essentially the same form taught.

                       2. Comprehension. Seeing relationships, concepts, and
                          abstractions beyond the simple remembering of the material.
                          Typically involves translating, interpreting, and estimating
                          future trends.

                          patterns or structures, such as a unique communication (a
                          theme or speech), a plan of operation (a research proposal),
                          or a set of abstract relations (schemes for classifying

                       6. Evaluation. The ability to judge the value of material for a

                          cognitive hierarchy because it involves elements of all the
                          other categories, plus conscious value judgments based on
                          clearly defined criteria.

                       Note: The same verbs may be used to describe multiple learning
                       levels or learning tasks, because they identify what the learner is
                       to do with the content. The nature of the content to be learned
                       helps determine the learning level or task. For example, see the
                       verb “Develop” identified in levels 3 and 5, or “Explain” in levels 3
                       and 4, etc.

                       1. Receiving. The getting, holding, and directing of the student's

                          object, phenomenon, or behavior ranging from acceptance of
                          a value to commitment. Includes instructional objectives
                          related to "attitudes" and "appreciation."

                               Organization of Objectives


Organizing goals       In organizing objectives, you may work from general statements
and objectives         or goals to specific objectives to produce an objective hierarchy
                       of the course structure and organization. This produces a
                       developmental structure that allows you to tell the students what
                       they will achieve overall and the enabling outcomes that will
                       contribute to this learning.


Levels of objectives   A learning outcomes hierarchy consists of two or more levels.

                          Terminal outcomes describe the end result of the instructional
                          experience. These outcomes may be published as goals
                          and/or objectives.
                          Developmental objectives are a series of enabling outcomes
                          that increase the probability of achieving a complex terminal
                          outcome. This approach makes it possible to check learner
                          performance in the developmental stage and provide feedback
                          and remediation as necessary.


Terms for objective    Learning hierarchies use various terms to describe educational
levels                 outcomes. The most common terms used to distinguish these
                       levels are:

                          Terminal Outcome
                             Goal and/or
                             Objective
                                Terminal
                                Primary

                          Developmental Level
                             Interim
                             Enabling


General to specific    At the course goal or mission level, the outcome is a broad,
                       general statement. However, as the course outcomes are
                       analyzed and organized systematically into smaller units, the
                       objectives become more specific. This systematic arrangement
                       provides a learning hierarchy for the course.

                                         Section B
                                       Develop Tests

Introduction            An effective measurement program is essential for all
                        instructional systems. To ensure that tests adequately measure
                        the objectives they support, the performance required in the test
                        must match the performance required in the objective. A good
                        way for you to develop tests that measure the objectives is to
                        develop tests immediately after you have developed the
                        objectives and before starting to develop instruction.


Purpose                 Tests serve several purposes:

                            Identify problems or weaknesses in the instruction.
                            Indicate whether a class is performing up to standards on
                            specific objectives.
                            Indicate instructor proficiency.
                            Diagnose problems in the instructional program.


Testing practices       Air Force educational measurement measures individual student
                        performance with respect to standards that are specified in the
                        objectives. This form of testing measures individual student
                        performance with respect to the standard of performance that are
                        specified in the objectives. To attain acceptable performance, the
                        student must meet or exceed the standards specified for the test.


Characteristics of      There are six basic characteristics that should be considered
tests                   when developing tests to ensure they measure what is intended
                        each time they are administered. The characteristics are:

                         Characteristic                           Refers to
                        Validity                 Degree to which a test measures what it
                                                 is intended to measure.
                        Reliability              Degree to which a test yields the same
                                                 results consistently.
                        Objectivity              Ability of a test to be free from variations
                                                 due to factors other than the behavior
                                                 being measured.

                                                who have mastered the knowledge or skill
                                                being tested and those who have not
                                                mastered it. For a norm-referenced test,

                                                knowledge or performance ability each
                                                student has attained.

Classification of       Most Air Force tests can be classified into two main groups:
tests                   written tests and performance tests.

                        There are two types of written tests:

                            Selection - Requires the student to choose the correct answer
                            from several provided. Examples are:
                                Multiple choice.
                                True-false.
                                Matching.

                            Supply – Requires that the student supply the answer from
                            recall. Examples are:
                                Essay.
                                Completion (short answer).
                                Labeling (identification).

                        There are two types of performance tests:

                            Product tests, which produce a product that is tangible,
                            permanent, and observable.
                            Process tests, where verbal skills or procedures are
                            observable but transient.

Test construction      Several key factors should be considered when constructing
factors                tests.

                           What to measure. Determine what to measure from the
                           objective to be covered by the test. For selection type test
                           items, two to four test items may be needed to adequately
                           measure each sample of behavior. Tests should measure
                           application of principles, knowledge of factual information,
                           ability to perform tasks, and transfer of knowledge and skills to
                           solve similar problems. The higher the level of learning, the
                           more demanding, complex, and abstract is the performance
                           expected. Supply type test items may be designed such that
                           one item measures several samples of behavior
                           simultaneously. Thus, the number of supply items needed to
                           address all samples of behavior depends on the item’s
                           complexity.

                           Test length. Adequate coverage of the course objective is
                           one of the major factors in determining the length of the test.
                           Another important factor is the time available for testing. If
                           time available for testing does not allow for administering a
                           test large enough to measure all course objectives, consider
                           creating several smaller tests that could be administered
                           sequentially throughout the course. Longer tests are
                           considered more reliable than shorter tests because they
                           cover more material, more completely. However, the overall
                           content validity of a series of short, related tests can be
                           considered equivalent to the content validity of a single, large
                           test containing items from all the smaller tests.

                           Selection and arrangement of test items. Select test items
                           that cover the most important points of the material. Test
                           items should be clear, concise and well written to minimize
                           misunderstandings. Items of the same type should be
                           grouped together in a test. Individual test items should also
                           be arranged in approximate order of difficulty, which allows
                           the students to progress as far as they can without spending
                           excessive time on difficult items at the first part of the test.

Constructing         Tests must be well written in order to measure what students
written tests        have learned or can do. You should be familiar with developing
                     the various types of written tests. Following is information on
                     preparing the most common types of written tests.

                     Note: Refer to Volume 12, Test and Measurements Handbook,
                     Table 12 for additional Test Construction Guidelines.


Multiple choice      Multiple-choice tests are probably the most-used written test.
                     They are used for testing problem-solving skills, application of
                     facts and principles, and understanding. A multiple-choice item
                     consists of a stem (a question or uncompleted statement), a
                     correct response, and distractors (incorrect responses). They
                     can be written at higher comprehension levels but can be very
                     difficult to construct, especially for novice test writers.

                     Construction Guidelines

                         Do not use the articles "a" and "an" at the end of the stem; this
                         can tend to indicate the correct answer.
                         All responses should follow grammatically from the stem.
                         All responses should be of approximately the same length.
                         All responses should have a similar grammatical structure.
                         All responses should use similar terminology.
                         Provide as many responses as necessary, but normally no
                         less than three.
                         Position the correct response randomly throughout the final
                         test. (For purposes of internal review, you can make all
                         correct answers "a".)
                         Limit the use of responses such as "none of the above" or "all
                         of the above."
                         Distractors should be plausible, but incorrect.
                         Responses should be arranged in order so that they increase
                         or decrease in length.
AFH 36-2235   Volume 10      1 November 2002                                          67




True-False       True-false tests are often used when you desire students to
                 identify a completely true or false statement. True-false tests
                 should be used sparingly, since the chance of random guessing
                 is high.

                 Construction Guidelines

                     Include only one idea in each statement.
                     Place the crucial element at or near the end of the statement.
                     Avoid using negatives such as "not," as they tend to confuse
                     students.
                     Do not use absolutes such as "all,” "every," "none," and
                     "never."
                     Do not use statements containing "some," "any," and
                     "generally."


Matching         Matching tests are used to measure the students' ability to
                 identify and discriminate among related or similar items.
                 Matching items normally use two columns of related items, and
                 students are required to match a series of items listed in one
                 column with related items in the other column. It provides a way
                 to test multiple knowledge simultaneously.

                 Construction Guidelines

                     Provide clear, concise directions on how to match the items in
                     the two columns.
                     Indicate whether the responses may be used more than once
                     or not at all.
                     Limit test items to a single area and the choices to a single
                     subject matter category.
                     Arrange the responses in the same logical order.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 10      1 November 2002                                            68




Completion          The completion test item requires the students to recall and
                    supply one or more key words that have been omitted from the
                    statement. The word(s), when placed in the appropriate blanks,
                    make the statement complete, meaningful, and true.

                    Construction Guidelines

                        Leave blanks for key words only.
                        Keep items brief.
                        Make all blanks approximately the same size.
                        Grammatical cues to the correct answer, such as the articles
                        "a" and "an" right before the blank, should be avoided.
                        Ensure that only one correct answer fits each block.


Labeling or         Labeling or identification tests are used to measure a student's
identification      ability to recall and label parts in pictures, schematics, diagrams,
                    or drawings. This form of testing is most often used to measure
                    recognition of equipment components or other concrete objects.

                    Construction Guidelines

                        Make all sketches, drawings, and illustrations clear and of
                        sufficient size. If possible, use the actual parts of a unit.
                        Provide sufficient information to indicate what the equipment is
                        and which part is to be labeled.
                        Parts to be labeled or identified should be clearly pointed out
                        by using lines or arrows.
                        Ensure that only one definite answer is possible.
AFH 36-2235   Volume 10      1 November 2002                                        69




Essay            Essay testing should be used when students are required to think
                 reflectively or creatively, to organize knowledge in the solution of
                 a problem, and to express their solutions in writing. The essay
                 test encourages a wider range of study and learning than other
                 test items. Essay tests are not the same as written papers.
                 Although some essay tests may be rather comprehensive, they
                 do not generally require the student to develop an extended
                 logical or factual argument for more than a few hundred words.
                 However, in PME, longer essay responses are common. Papers,
                 on the other hand, require students to extend their arguments
                 typically over several thousand words.

                 Construction Guidelines

                     Test several objectives in an essay.
                     State the item clearly so the student will know exactly what is
                     expected.
                     The essay item should ask for comparisons, decisions,
                     solutions, cause-effect relationships, explanations, or
                     summaries.
                     When possible, use more essay items and limit the discussion
                     on each.
                     Set limits on essay questions, such as time or number of
                     words.

                                   Section C
                        Review and Use Existing Materials

Introduction           Developing instructional materials is an expensive, time-
                       consuming task regardless of the medium used. After developing
                       the objectives and tests, one of the first tasks is to determine if
                       materials already exist that will support the objectives. It is
                       possible that some of the material found during the review may
                       not totally satisfy the need. In this case, don't hesitate to modify
                       the materials to "fit" the need. Even the use of some portions of
                       existing materials will be economically advantageous. In every
                       case, time spent reviewing existing material will be time well
                       spent.


Why review             Several benefits to be gained from using existing material are:
existing materials?
                           Time - Developing instructional materials is time-consuming;
                           therefore, using existing materials will save time.
                           Personnel - Using existing materials saves man-hours that
                           can be spent developing other portions of the instruction.
                           Material - Valuable materials will be saved.
                           Funds - Time, personnel, and materials cost money.


Where can you find     Materials exist that cover almost every aspect of instruction such
materials?             as leadership, mathematics, weather, and management. Several
                       sources of existing materials are:

                           DoD.
                           Other services.
                           Other federal agencies.
                           Industry/commercial.
                           Colleges and universities.
                           Defense Instructional Technology Information System (DITIS).
                           Web-based resources.


Types of existing      Existing materials can be found in many different types of media.
material               For example, materials may exist in one or more of the following:
AFH 36-2235         Volume 10      1 November 2002                                     72




Types of existing          Textbooks/publications/technical orders/handbooks.

                           Job aids.
                           Training aids.


How to select          In order to select the appropriate materials, a deliberate and
materials              thorough review of existing materials must be conducted. After it
                       has been determined what instructional materials are needed to
                       support the objectives and materials have been gathered for
                       review, the review process is ready to begin. A good way to
                       conduct a review is to use a job aid. The job aid helps to
                       standardize the process and allows a comparison between
                       materials under review. Following is an example of a job aid that
                       can be constructed to aid in the review of existing materials.

                                          Existing Material Checklist
                                                                                 Yes/No
                           Does the material meet the requirements of the
                           objective(s)?
                           Is the content level of the material appropriate?
                           Is the material accurate?
                           Is the material current?
                           Is the material copyrighted?
                           Does the material address motivational factors?
                           Is the material properly sequenced?
                           Does the material provide sufficient guidance?
                           Are sufficient practice exercises provided?
                           Are the measurements adequate?


                       Other types of job aids or forms can be used to review and select
                       materials. Keep the job aids or forms as simple as possible.

Making existing      The materials you need may or may not exist. If they do, they
material usable      may require modification before they can be used in course
                     development. If this is the case, consider modifying or updating
                     the material (unless it is copyrighted), since it is normally cost-
                     effective and efficient to do so.

                     Modification of existing materials may include:

                         Adding new material.
                         Expanding existing material.
                         Deleting material.
                         Updating material.
                         Resequencing material.

Introduction       Once the objectives and tests have been developed and existing
                   instructional materials have been reviewed for usability, you are
                   ready to start designing instruction. Designing quality, cost-

                            Select Instructional Method


Introduction       In the design phase, one of the first and most important tasks is
                   that of selecting the instructional method. In order to select the
                   most appropriate method, several key factors must be considered
                   which have a direct impact on the effectiveness and efficiency of
                   the instructional system.


Definition         Instructional method is the procedure or process used to attain an
                   objective(s). Examples of instructional methods are:

                       Lecture.
                       Team learning and teaching.
                       Demonstration.
                       Self-study.
                       Discussion.
                       Cooperative Learning.
                       Case Study.
                       Experiential.


Continuum of       "Method" is the primary way a learning experience will be
instructional      conducted. One consideration in selecting a method is the
methods            degree of learner control desired.

Continuum of         Traditionally, most Air Force instruction has been instructor-led.
instructional        The instructor's role in the classroom placed the instructor in
methods              control. Students had little control over what they learned, how
(Continued)          they learned it, or how much time they spent. It became very
                     easy to develop instructional programs for the instructor rather
                     than the student.

                     Emphasis is now being placed on students controlling the
                     learning situation.

                        Emerging technologies, combined with adult learning theories,
                        are changing the emphasis from instructor-controlled to
                        learner-controlled instruction. The first effort in learner-
                        controlled instruction goes back many years to programmed
                        text, which had limited application. However, with the new
                        technologies, the possibilities are almost unlimited. The
                        reasons for changing emphasis become apparent when you
                        consider the following points.
                        Interactive technologies, such as ICW, can allow the learner to
                        control what objectives to work on, how to sequence the
                        lessons, the pace of the instruction, and how many and what
                        kind of examples to review.
                        In many cases, adults learn better when they can control the
                        learning situation according to their individual needs.
                        Research shows that self-pacing may hinder progress or
                        completion.

                                      Select Media


Introduction          As you have seen, selection of instructional methods and media
                      are discussed separately. However, in many applications they
                      can't be considered separately. Regardless of whether they are
                      considered together or separately, media selection is of no less
                      importance to the design process. No single medium is the most
                      appropriate choice for every instructional situation. Selecting the
                      appropriate media ensures that the information to be learned is
                      presented to the students by the most effective and efficient
                      means possible.


Definition            Media are the means, instruments, or materials used to
                      communicate information–in other words, a means of giving
                      information to the students.


Media guides          A series of media guides has been included in this section to
                      assist you in:

                         Selecting media.
                         Determining learning potential.
                         Applying various technologies.

                                 Develop Lesson Plans


Steps in lesson       The individual lesson plan is the plan you produce to organize
planning              what you present in a lesson, as well as when and how.
                      Recommended steps to use in the planning of new lessons
                      include:

                          Determine the objective.
                          Rough-out the evaluation instrument(s).
                          Finalize the evaluation instrument(s).
                          Research the topic defined by the objective.
                          Select the instructional method.
                          Identify your planning format.
                          Decide how to organize the lesson.
                          Choose the support material.
                          Prepare the lesson from beginning to end.
                          Prepare a final outline.

                      Your hierarchy of objectives should provide an adequate starting
                      place for building individual lessons. You may find it useful to
                      attach learning planning products to your objectives as you
                      proceed.


Specify learning      Identification of lesson content specifies the inputs–materials,
content               information, instructions–the learner will use to achieve the
                      objective.

                      Attaching the input specifications to the objective enables the
                      planner to identify what resources and materials must be
                      prepared or obtained and provided to learners in order to help
                      them achieve behavioral objectives.


Design                Once the objectives/content selection is fairly complete, the
presentation          presentation sequence can be designed for the entire course.
sequence              The following guidelines are offered for the sequencing of
                      content.

                          Place easily learned material early in the sequence.
                          Introduce broad concepts and technical terms early in the
                          sequence.

sequence              Place prerequisite knowledge and skills in the sequence prior
(Continued)           to the points where they must be combined with subsequent
                      knowledge, skills, and application.
                      Provide for practice and review skills and knowledge, which
                      are essential parts of later lessons.
                      Introduce a skill concept in the lesson in which it is most
                      frequently used.
                      Do not overload any lesson with elements that are difficult to
                      learn.
                      Provide for practice of required skills and review of concepts
                      and principles in areas where transfer of identical or related
                      ability is not likely to occur unaided.
                      Place complex or cumulative skills late in the sequence.

                                 Section E
                        Develop Implementation Plan

Definition of       An implementation plan documents the design of the instructional
implementation      program and the plan for implementation. Plans may include, but
plan                not be limited to, information such as:

                        Identification information.
                        Parameters of instructional system.
                        Type of instruction.
                        Instructional methods.
                        Instructional content.
                        Resource requirements.
                        Design, development, and implementation milestones.

                    Implementation plans may include resource and control
                    documents such as:

                        Tasking letters or messages.
                        Equipment lists.
                        Personnel documents.
                        Facility requirements.
                        Course maps.
                        Course charts.
                        Resource constraints.
                        Lesson plans.


Purpose of          Implementation plans that are well developed have several
implementation      purposes. Some of the purposes are:
plan
                    Document the instructional system.
                    Identify resource requirements/constraints such as manpower,
                    equipment or facilities.
                    Set the design, development, and implementation milestones.
                    Serve as the approval document for operation of the instructional
                    system.

                    Implementation plans may serve other purposes as determined
                    by the needs or requirements of the instructional system.
AFH 36-2235    Volume 10      1 November 2002                                       90




Who is            Implementation plans are the direct responsibility of instructional
responsible?      systems management. Managers should develop a plan that
                  describes or documents the instructional system. In order to
                  develop this plan, input will be required from other organizations
                  such as instructional staff, resource managers, or civil engineers.
AFH 36-2235    Volume 10      1 November 2002                                      91



                                 Section F
          Design Instructional Information Management System

Purpose           The purpose of an automated instructional information
                  management system is to enable those responsible to better
                  manage system information in real time. For example, the
                  automated system can be used by:

                      Instructors to update student status.
                      Registrar to track student status.
                      Instructional designers to update instructional materials.
                      Managers to manage resources.


Who is            Responsibility for designing an instructional information
responsible?      management system normally falls on a project manager.
                  However, course managers have the responsibility to ensure that
                  the instructional information is adequately managed for their
                  instructional system.


Designing a       Managers will probably not have an option of using or not using
management        an instructional information management system. If one does
system            exist, you will likely be required to use it to manage the
                  information that it is capable of managing. However, if a system
                  doesn't already exist, and there are plans to install one, you may
                  be called on to help design it. Also, if a system does exist, you
                  may be called upon at some time to help redesign it. If you have
                  the opportunity to help design or redesign an instructional
                  information management system, there are several things that
                  you should consider.

                      What is the cost?
                      What are the hardware capabilities?
                      Are there any special environmental requirements for the
                      hardware?
                      What are the software capabilities?
                      Is the system documentation adequate?
                      Who are the system users?
                      Are the hardware and software user-friendly?
                      Does this system have proven reliability?
                      Is the system maintainable?
AFH 36-2235   Volume 10      1 November 2002                                       92




Designing a          Will the system interconnect/interface to existing systems?
management           Is the system software compatible with other software?
system               Does the hardware have expansion capability?
(Continued)          Can the software be upgraded or modified easily?
                     What instructional information will the system be able to
                     manage?

                 These are some of the items that should be considered when
                 designing or redesigning an instructional information

                What to Evaluate in the Design Phase

Overview         Consider the following points:

                     Review the course objectives developed in this phase and
                     ensure they are stated at appropriate levels of learning for the
                     intent of the instruction.

                     Review test questions and ensure they are capable of
                     measuring the instructional objectives at the stated levels of
                     learning.

                     As this phase of the ISD process may be the most time-
                     consuming part of the development effort, be sure to make a
                     final check for existing course materials that may be useful in
                     your program.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 10      1 November 2002                                        94



                                 Section H
                        Update ISD Management Plan

Project             During your initial planning of the ISD project, the managers
management          developed an ISD management plan to serve as a road map for
                    managing the instructional development process and the
                    instructional system. You developed the plan early in the initial
                    planning stages to plan how you are going to get where you are
                    going. As you complete the design phase of the ISD project, you
                    will likely have gathered additional and better information on
                    which to base your management decisions. If this is the case,
                    you will need to update the management plan.


Purpose             Since the management plan is a "tool" for managing the
                    instructional development process and the instructional system,
                    update it at the end of each phase of instructional development,
                    or when any significant change occurs that impacts planning. If
                    the plan is not continually updated with the most current, accurate
                    information, it will fail as a management tool.


Who is              The ISD project manager is responsible for seeing that the
responsible?        management plan is updated at the end of each phase of ISD, or
                    after any significant change has occurred that impacts the current
                    planning.


What should be      The ISD management plan will be updated after each phase of
updated?            instructional develop-ment, as applicable. Update the plan to
                    include the latest information, such as:

                        New or revised milestones.
                        Refinements to project definition.
                        Changes in project resource requirements or constraints.
                        Revisions to support requirements.
                        Identification of new taskings.
                        New information resulting from analysis that impacts project
                        management.

What should be      Once you have updated the ISD management plan and ensured
updated?            that previously discussed processes and procedures are in order,
(Continued)         you are ready to enter the development phase. But remember,
                    ISD is flexible. You will find yourself re-entering the decision
                    phase as you progress through ISD.

                          Develop Instructional Materials

Introduction           In the design phase, the method and medium best suited for the
                       instructional need were selected. At this point, you are ready to
                       start developing the course materials. Developing materials is a
                       time-consuming and exacting task regardless of the medium you
                       use.


Description            Media are the means, instrument, or materials used to
                       communicate information to the student. Examples of media
                       range from the classroom instructor using a lesson plan to study
                       guides, CBT, satellite training, interactive video, web-based, or
                       numerous other types of media.


Types of delivery      Instruction can be delivered using the following media:

                           Instructor.
                           Print-based material.
                           Slide/tape presentations.
                           Audio/video tapes.
                           Interactive video.
                           Training devices/aids.
                           Satellite.


Development            Development of materials for presenting instruction requires
activities             many activities. Some of the most common development
                       activities are listed in the table below.

Who is            Developing materials normally involves teamwork and requires
responsible?      various skills. Curriculum developers are responsible for
                  planning, scheduling, and making sure the materials are
                  produced and correlated with the evaluation instrument. The
                  following table lists some team members involved in production of
                  different types of materials.

Guidelines for      When developing course presentation materials, make sure they:
developing
materials               Support the objectives.
                        Are student-centered.
                        Meet the design that was specified in the design phase.
                        Use techniques that are consistent with the principles of

          Install Instructional Information Management System

Introduction         As you learned in Chapter 5, Section F, an automated
                     instructional information management system will facilitate
                     management in real time. As a curriculum developer, you may
                     never be involved in designing or redesigning an information
                     management system. However, if you are involved, you may
                     also be involved in the installation of the system. This section
                     lists the basic issues to be considered when installing an
                     information management system.


What should you      If you are involved in installing or testing an information
look for?            management system, there are several things you should
                     consider.

                         Is the hardware user-friendly?
                         Is the software user-friendly?
                         Are there adequate terminals for all system users to do their
                         jobs in a timely manner?
                         Is the information management in your area accurate?
                         Is the information management in your area complete?
                         Is the system reliable?

                                Validate Instruction

Introduction          ISD is more an art than a science. It offers no fixed formulas that
                      guarantee outcomes–only guidelines. Validation is a quality
                      improvement tool that helps identify problems in the instruction
                      during development so that revisions can be made.


What is validation?   Validation is a process that assesses the effectiveness of a
                      course as it is being developed. Its purpose is quality
                      improvement. It is a process of repetitive cycles of development,
                      tryouts, and revisions until evidence shows that the instruction is
                      effective.


When should you       It is important that validation be conducted during, not after,
validate?             development. The purpose is to correct mistakes or problems
                      before you spend too many resources on a flawed product.
                      Validation should be done as segments, units, or blocks are
                      being developed.

                                Develop Validation Plan


Purpose               As with any other plan, a validation plan provides curriculum
                      developers and instructors with a "road map" for validating the
                      course. A validation plan adds structure and creditability to the
                      validation process.


What is in a          Validation plans contain the following information:
validation plan?
                          Description of course to be validated (objectives, method,
                          media).
                          Validators.
                          Validation procedures.
                          Validation schedules.
                          Number of tryouts to be conducted.
                          Number of students to be used in small-group and field
                          tryouts.
                          Sources and how results will be documented.
                          How problems will be resolved.

                      Remember, include only necessary information in the validation
                      plan and keep it simple.

                             Conduct Internal Reviews


Introduction        The first step in the validation process is internal reviews. These
                    reviews identify content inaccuracies, instructional weaknesses,
                    and resource shortfalls.


Who should          Individuals who perform internal reviews include:

                        Content experts, who make sure the content is accurate and
                        the coverage is adequate.
                        Curriculum developers, who ensure that the material follows
                        sound instructional principles and that the methods and
                        activities are appropriate to the content and specified target
                        population.


What should be      Materials should be reviewed as they are developed. The table

Common problems     Some common problems that you may identify in the material
identified          during the internal reviews are:

                        Lack of agreement.
                        Inaccuracies in subject matter.
                        Incomplete material.
                        Weaknesses.
                        Lack of continuity.
                        Lack of timeliness in preparation or review.

After a review      Upon completion of the internal reviews, you should:

                        Determine the changes needed to improve the materials.
                        Decide the best way to make changes to the materials.
                        Make the needed changes to the materials.

                              Conduct Individual Tryouts


Introduction          During the individual tryouts, the curriculum developer tests the
                      materials on individual students. Use several students for
                      comparison in order to gain valid and reliable results. In long-
                      term education courses this may not be practical, and other
                      testing methods may have to be adapted.


Purpose               The purpose of individual (one-on-one) tryouts is to determine the
                      effectiveness of small segments or units of materials as they are
                      developed.


Select students for   When selecting students for individual tryouts, consider these
tryouts               issues.

                         Students selected should represent the target population in:
                             Aptitude
                             Attitude
                             Prior knowledge
                             Background experience

                         Select students for the first tryouts from the upper percentage
                         ranges in aptitude and background. The reasons for selecting
                         these students include:
                             Above-Avg students often point out and analyze
                             weaknesses in the materials.
                             If better students cannot learn the material, less capable
                             students will not be able to.
                             If lower-level students are used in the individual test and
                             they do well, there is no way to tell if the material is at the
                             right level.
                             It is easier to work down from a known point of difficulty
                             than to work up from an unknown point of difficulty.


Before a tryout       You should prepare the students for the tryout by explaining:

                         Purpose of the tryout.
                         Their role in the tryout.
                         That they are not being evaluated–the training is.
                         That their feedback is necessary to determine the quality of
                         the material.

During a tryout      During the individual tryouts, the curriculum developer should:

                         Use a pretest to identify entry behavior.
                         Use a post test to assess learning as a result of the tryout.
                         Observe where each student seems to have problems.
                         Give assistance only when essential.
                         Note where errors occur, type of errors, and how many
                         students make the same error(s).
                         Get student views about difficulties encountered during the
                         tryout.
                         Ask each student for suggestions.


Common problems      Some common problems that you may identify during individual
identified           tryouts are:

                         Improper sequencing of instruction.
                         Inadequate content.
                         Inadequate explanation of content.
                         Wrong assumption about target population's prerequisite
                         knowledge.
                         Confusing test items.
                         Test items that do not measure objectives.


After a tryout       After individual tryouts, analyze the data to determine if there are
                     problems. Change the material as appropriate.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 10       1 November 2002                                        111


                              Conduct Small-Group Tryouts


Purpose              The purpose of conducting small-group tryouts is to determine if
                     the instruction is appropriate for the Avg target students.


Before a small-      Before a small-group tryout, you should:
group tryout
                         Determine the number of students and groups to be used in
                         the tryouts.
                         Select representative students from the target population.
                         Ensure that instruction has been revised in accordance with
                         results from individual tryouts.
                         Ensure that student materials are available in adequate
                         quantities.
                         Establish the number of trials a student will be permitted to
                         achieve the criterion performance.


During a tryout      During a small-group tryout, you should:

                         Record the time each student takes to complete the material.
                         This information will be used to validate unit time, course
                         lengths, and course content.
                         Record student responses. This information will help
                         determine the weaknesses of the materials.

                     Do not supplement the materials. This will skew the results of the
                     tryout.


After a tryout       After a tryout, analyze the results to:

                         Identify the Avg completion time for each segment or unit.
                         This information determines the exact time for lessons,
                         segments, units, or modules.
                         Revise the materials.

                           Conduct Operational (Field) Tryouts


Purpose                The final stage of validation may be called field, or operational,
                       tryouts. All of the materials should be complete and ready to go.
                       These tryouts serve several purposes:
                           Determine if the instruction actually accomplishes the
                           objectives.
                           Provide feedback from a large sample of the target population
                           for final revisions.
                           Identify implementation problems, such as equipment and
                           facilities.


Student selection      For field tryouts, students are assigned to the tryout group using
                       the normal class assignment process.


During a tryout        In many respects, a field tryout is like the normal day-to-day
                       operation of a course, in that you should:
                          Present the instruction in a normal environment.
                          Collect validation data such as time requirements,
                          measurement results, instructor and student comments,
                          problem areas.
                          Use adequate class samples to ensure that the data are both
                          valid and reliable.


Data collection        You may collect data from students before, during, and after the
                       training.

                      Analyze the data gathered during the tryouts.
                      Revise the materials as necessary.

                               Section E
               What to Evaluate in the Development Phase

Introduction      This phase of the ISD process includes validation of the
                  instruction you have created. Evaluation of this phase takes
                  place during the internal reviews, individual, small-group, and
                  operational try-outs, as described earlier in this chapter.

                  The data you collect from these validation trails should be fed
                  back into the most appropriate phases of the development
                  process to effect improvements. For example, if test questions
                  need improvement, return to the Design Phase. Another
                  example would be if data indicated that your initial analysis of the
                  course's target audience was in error, you should return to the
                  Analysis Phase.

                  Carefully develop an appropriate feedback mechanism between
                  the evaluator and the instructor and course developer. In this
                  feedback mechanism, the program evaluator will analyze and
                  interpret the curriculum data received through the evaluation
                  system (tests, critiques, surveys, etc.). He/she should provide
                  the analysis and interpretations, along with recommendations for
                  curriculum improvement, through a formal channel to course
                  supervisors, instructors, and developers so they may consider the
                  evaluator's recommendations for improvement. Not all, or even
                  any, of the evaluator's recommendations may be accepted by
                  management or instructional personnel. Whether or not the
                  recommendations are accepted, management and instructional
                  personnel should formally respond to the recommendations
                  indicating how they will be incorporated or the rationale for not
                  incorporating them. This formal feedback mechanism from
                  evaluator to manager/instructor and back to evaluator is to
                  provide an audit trail of curricular decisions and their supporting
                  data and rationales. Such audit trails are much more that mere
                  paperwork drills. They constitute the "corporate" decision trail for
                  the entire instructional program, which is something that both
                  accreditors and auditors look for as evidence of a mature
                  instructional program.

                  This evaluation feedback mechanism should be incorporated into
                  the final course structure when it is officially implemented in the
                  final phase of the ISD process.

                           Finalize Instructional Materials

Purpose                The purpose of finalizing materials is to ensure that they:

                           Have been revised to include the most current and accurate
                           information.
                           Are complete.
                           Are ready for implementation.

                                        Overview


Introduction         At this point in the ISD process, the course has been validated
                     and you are ready to implement the instruction. Prior to actual
                     implementation, you need to ensure that everything is ready to
                     support it. For example, are the system functions in place, are
                     adequate resources available, and is the instructional system
                     itself ready?


Objectives           The objectives of this chapter are to:

                         Discuss final preparations for course implementation.
                         Describe implementation activities.


In this chapter      This chapter contains two sections.

                       Section            Title                                  Page

                   Implementation of System Functions

What you do        As a curriculum developer, it is unlikely that you will ever be
                   required to implement the system functions. Your job will be to
                   ensure that these functions are being performed to support,
                   operate, and maintain courses.


What they are      The system functions of management, support, administration,
                   and delivery are described fully in the second chapter of this
                   handbook. Evaluation is an ongoing function that is discussed in
                   the next chapter.

Introduction         To this point, considerable time has been spent planning the
                     instructional system, securing resources, managing the
                     development process, and arranging for system support.
                     Curriculum developers have analyzed, designed, developed and
                     validated the instruction. Now the course is ready to implement.
                     During implementation, you will continually evaluate its
                     effectiveness.

                      Preparations for Conducting Instruction


Introduction        Although preparations for conducting instruction started in initial
                    planning and have continued throughout the analysis, design,
                    and development phases of ISD, final checks need to be made
                    prior to implementing the course. Sufficient preparation is
                    essential to successful instruction.


What should be      The type of instruction being implemented will determine what
checked?            should be done to get ready. For example, an exportable course
                    will not have the same items to be checked as a course taught in
                    a classroom environment. Some of the last-minute preparation
                    may include checking the following:

                        Equipment
                        Equipment is available in adequate numbers and in
                        operational condition. Equipment support is available.
                        Facilities
                        Appropriate facilities are available. Facility modifications,
                        such as electrical and air conditioning, are complete.
                        Human Resources
                        Personnel are ready, including instructors and students.
                        Students have been scheduled for the classes.
                        Funds
                        Adequate funds are available to meet implementation costs
                        and the costs associated with daily operation of the course.
                        Time
                        Curriculum developers have had adequate time to develop the
                        materials.
                        Materials and Supplies
                        Materials are available in adequate quantities to support
                        instruction. Supplies are available in adequate quantities to
                        support implementation.

                        Copyright permissions have been obtained.

                              There is no substitute for good planning and
                                         adequate preparation.

                             Conducting Instruction


Introduction      If adequate preparations have been made throughout the
                  development process and a last-minute check of each system
                  component was made, there should be few problems, if any,
                  encountered with implementation.


Conducting        Once the course is implemented and becomes operational, it will
instruction       normally remain so until there is no longer a need. The focus will
                  be on conducting effective and efficient instruction. Ongoing
                  activities that ensure system integrity are described below.

                      Resource management is probably the single most critical
                      issue. Resources must be well managed to gain maximum
                      benefit.
                      Faculty development is an activity that goes on continually
                      while instruction is being conducted. Curriculum developers
                      as well as other staff and faculty should periodically attend
                      courses, conferences, and workshops that help them develop
                      professionally in curriculum development.
                      Conducting instruction is at the center of system integrity.
                      No matter what has been done to this point, the program can
                      fail if the course is not properly conducted. Some helpful items
                      to remember are:
                            Instruction should be student-centered.
                            Instruction should follow the course syllabus.
                            Curriculum developers or instructors should always
                            perform professionally in the teaching-learning
                            environment.
                            Teaching staff should be qualified to perform their duties.

                      Evaluation maintains the quality of instruction. During the life
                      of the course, evaluation is continually performed to ensure
                      the quality of the program. It is covered in detail in the next
                      chapter of this handbook.

                                       Overview


Description          Evaluation is a function of the ISD process that require the
                     continuous design, collection and analysis of data from an
                     instructional program or a course to determine its value or worth
                     as outlined by the institution's mission and goals. It focuses its
                     attention in four basic areas: (1) Did learning take place (in
                     terms of a change in cognitive knowledge), (2) Were students'
                     attitudes affected by their learning experience, (3) Did a change
                     in behavior take place, and (4) Did the learning (cognitive and
                     behavioral changes) cause the student's organization to become
                     more efficient and/or effective?


Objectives           The objectives of this chapter are to:

                         Describe the operational evaluation process.
                         Explain the four steps in the evaluation process.
                         Explain internal and external evaluation.

                                  Section A
                       Levels of Educational Evaluation

Introduction         Educational program evaluation consists for four levels. These
                     levels provide instructional managers with an overall perspective
                     of how well the instruction achieved the established goals and
                     objectives of the school or organization. Program evaluation is
                     an ongoing process that begins when the instructional program is
                     activated and continues through the life of the program. The
                     nature and scope of the program evaluation will depend, to a
                     great degree, on the type of course being evaluated. Courses
                     exported to the field, or taught via distance learning methods,
                     may not have the same evaluation requirements as courses
                     taught in-residence, but the basic four levels of program
                     evaluation should still be addressed.


Definition           Program evaluation is the continual process of evaluating an
                     instructional program to identify and correct problems and to
                     maintain and improve the quality of the program.


Who is               Most schools have personnel designated as course/program
responsible?         evaluators. In lieu of such personnel, curriculum developers are
                     typically responsible for evaluation of their courses. Other
                     organizations or activities, such as inspection teams or other
                     command evaluation programs, may also provide input for
                     evaluating your course.


What should you      When conducting a program evaluation, look for both strengths
look for?            and weaknesses in the course, with special emphasis on:

                         Effectiveness and efficiency of the course
                         How well the graduates are performing in their jobs
                         If instruction is being provided that is not needed
                         If needed instruction is not being provided
AFH 36-2235     Volume 10       1 November 2002                                      124




Levels of program   Program evaluation consists of four levels, each of which
evaluation          characterizes a different aspect of the instructional program.

                       Level 1 – Student Learning – focuses on whether or not
                       learning took place.
                       Level 2 – Student Attitude – regarding the course, did the
                       student see a benefit and the value in participating in the
                       program / course.
                       Level 3 – Behavioral Change – did the student modify his or
                       her behavior as a result of having attended the program /
                       course. Is the student using the concepts and principles
                       taught during the course on the job?
                       Level 4 – As a result of having attended the program / course,
                       did the student's job performance become more effective or
                       efficient?

                                     Section B
                          Internal and External Evaluation

Overview               There are two major divisions in program evaluation: internal and
                       external evaluations. The internal evaluation component is
                       composed of the first two levels of the program evaluation
                       process. These levels focus attention on maintaining the quality
                       of the course. Sometimes internal evaluations are referred to as
                       course reviews where the evaluation component is looking
                       specifically at whether or not learning took place and how the
                       students perceived their learning experience, i.e., did the student
                       see the value in attending the course?

                       The external evaluation component is composed of the last two
                       levels of the program evaluation process. The last two levels
                       focus attention on determining if the knowledge, skills, and
                       attitudes acquired in the course enhanced the graduate's job
                       proficiency.


Definition             Internal evaluation is the periodic, ongoing process of gathering
                       and analyzing internal feedback and management data from
                       within the school environment in order to assess the success of
                       the instruction.

                       External evaluation is the periodic, ongoing process of gathering
                       and analyzing feedback data on graduates of the course.


Who is                 Curriculum developers are responsible for periodically conducting
responsible?           internal and external evaluations of their courses. Other
                       organizations or agencies will normally be involved in the
                       evaluation by providing input data in the form of inspection
                       reports or critiques.


What is required?      Three basic stages are involved in accomplishing any type of
                       program evaluation:

                           Data collection
                           Data analysis
                           Interpreting results and revising the curriculum

                       Each of these stages is discussed in further detail below.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 10      1 November 2002                                          126




Stage 1 –            The first stage of program evaluation is made up of several
Data Collection      facets:

                         Identify who is responsible for gathering the evaluation data.
                         Decide when and where the data will be collected.
                         Determine data collection sources. Some sources are:
                             Pre and post test data.
                             Self-inspections.
                             Formal reports.
                             Student critiques.
                             Direct observations.
                             Faculty evaluations.
                             Surveys.
                             Questionnaires.
                             Field visits.
                             Job performance evaluations.

                         Establish procedures for collecting the evaluation data
                         Collect the data.


Stage 2 –            Before beginning this stage, the evaluator will need to ensure that
Analyze data         sufficient data samples have been collected in order to validate
                     the reliability of the finding and to ensure that there is
                     generalizability from the sample to the population. There is no
                     easy or obvious way to determine how many samples are enough
                     to ensure a representative sampling. Realistically speaking, time
                     and money often are limiting factors in the sampling process.
                     Regardless of how large or small your sample is, however, you
                     should strive to collect enough data from a variety of sources to
                     ensure you feel confident that the sample you collected is as
                     representative as possible. Data analysis consist of several
                     activities:

                         Identify who is responsible for analyzing the data.
                         Decide when the data will be analyzed.
                         Determine validity of the data.
                         Establish procedures for analyzing the data.
                         Analyze the data.
                         Publish the results of the analysis.

Stage 3 –              The evaluator makes recommendations for curriculum
Interpreting results   improvement based on the interpretations of his/her data
and revising the       analysis. This activity often brings the evaluator and the
curriculum             curriculum developer together to discuss the importance of the
                       interpretations and what they mean for curriculum revision. This
                       is a crucial stage in the evaluation process, because it is where
                       the ISD system "closes the loop" so to speak on the curriculum
                       development process. To adequately complete the cyclic ISD
                       process, the curriculum developer must respond to all of the
                       evaluator's recommendations for curriculum improvement. This
                       does not mean that all, or any, of the evaluator's recommen-
                       dations must be adopted. However, it does mean that the
                       curriculum developer must respond with a justifiable rationale if a
                       recommendation is not accepted. This channeling of evaluation
                       data back into the curriculum revision process not only defines
                       the ISD model's cyclic nature, it also ensures that improvements
                       in the instructional program can be tied directly to decisions
                       based on evaluation of the program's success. This stage of
                       program evaluation consists of the following activities:

                          Determine, based on the data analyses, what revisions are
                          required.
                          Identify what components of the system are affected.
                          Assess the impact of the revisions.
                          Coordinate and/or get approval to revise.
                          Revise the course materials.
                          Update documentation.


When is it done?       Internal evaluations are conducted while the student is attending
                       the course or program. These data provide the school with
                       immediate feedback as to how well the students met the
                       educational objectives of the course or program.

                       External evaluations are conducted after the students have
                       graduated from the course or program, usually 6 months or so.
                       These data provide the school with input regarding how effective
                       and efficient the course or program is to the user's organization.

                       Both internal and external evaluations are ongoing processes and
                       will continue for the life of the course or program.

Summary          The following are summary points:

                     Evaluation is a formal phase of the ISD process.
                     Evaluation is conducted to ensure that the process is being
                     executed as planned and to provide feedback to the faculty
                     and curriculum developers on the program's success.
                     Evaluations focus on curriculum, the students, and the
                     instructors.
                     The ISD process in education courses can take 6 -12 months
                     or longer to develop.
                     Evaluation provides a systematic and continuous process to
                     furnish data and information for assessing the effectiveness
                     and efficiency of educational programs throughout the cycle
                     and beyond.

                                         TERMS
The following list of definitions includes those terms commonly used in education as it
relates to instructional system development and as used in this handbook. The list is
not to be considered all-inclusive.

Association. The connection made between an input (stimulus) and an action
(response).

Attitude. (a) The emotions or feelings that influence a learner's desire or choice to
perform a particular task. (b) A positive alteration in personal and professional
beliefs, values, and feelings that will enable the learner to use skills and knowledge
to implement positive change in the work environment. Also see Knowledge and
Skill.

Behavior. Any activity, overt or covert, capable of being measured.

Cognitive Strategies. The capability of individuals to govern their own learning,
remembering, and thinking behavior.

Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI). The use of computers to aid in the delivery
of instruction. A variety of interactive instructional modes are used including tutorial,
drill, practice, gaming, simulations, or combinations. CAI is an integral part of
computer-based instruction (CBI) and computer-based training (CBT).

Computer-Based Instruction (CBI) and Computer-Based Training (CBT). The
use of computers to aid in the delivery and management of instruction. CBI and
CBT are synonymous and are used interchangeably. CAI (the delivery of
instruction) and CMI (computer-managed instruction) are both elements of CBI and
CBT.

Computer-Managed Instruction (CMI). The use of computers to manage the
instructional process in CBI. Management normally includes functions such as
registration, pretesting, diagnostic counseling, progress testing, and posttesting.
CMI is also used to schedule and manage educational resources and actual
equipment.

Constraints. Limiting or constraining conditions or factors, such as policy
considerations, time limitations, equipment, environmental factors, personnel,
budgetary, or other resource limitations.

Course. (a) Logically grouped instruction on a subject, designed to achieve
predefined learning objectives. It usually concerns a single job or task (job-skills-type
training) or a section of organized knowledge (information-type training). (b) A
complete series of instructional units identified by a common title or number. (c) An
ordered arrangement of subject matter designed to instruct personnel in the
AFH 36-2235        Volume 10         1 November 2002                                              144


knowledge, skills, or attitudes required for the performance of tasks in a designated
area of specialization. A course consists of one or more modules.

Course Chart. A qualitative course control document that states the course identity,
length, and security classification, lists major items of equipment, and summarizes
the subject matter covered.

Course Control Documents. Specialized publications used to control the quality of
the instructional system. Examples are standards, plans of instruction, syllabi, and
course charts.

Courseware. Training materials such as technical data, textual materials,
audiovisual instructional materials, and computer-based instructional materials.

Criterion. (a) The standard by which something is measured. (b) In test validation,
the standard against which test instruments are correlated to indicate that accuracy
with which they predict human performance in some specified area. (c) In
evaluation, the measure used to determine the adequacy of a product, process,
behavior, and other conditions.

Criterion-Referenced Test (CRT). A test to determine, as objectively as possible, a
student's achievement in relation to a standard based on criterion objectives. During
instructional development, the CRT can be used to measure the effectiveness of the
instructional system. The test may involve multiple-choice items, fill-in items,
essays, or actual performance of a task. If given immediately after the learning
sequence, it is an acquisition test; if given considerably later, it is a retention test; if it
requires performance not specifically learned during instruction, it is a transfer test.

Discrimination. The process of making different responses to a stimulus. A
discrimination requires a person to determine the differences among inputs and to
respond differently to each.

Distance Learning. Training that is exported, such as from a resident course to a
field location. It is instruction that takes place without the physical presence of the
instructor.

Duty. A large segment of the work done by an individual; major divisions of work in
a job.

Education. The formal academic instruction offered by institutions of higher
learning that focuses on the study of the nature and principles of a given discipline.

Evaluation. A judgment expressed as a measure or ranking of trainee
achievement, instructor performance, process, application, instructional material,
and other factors (see DoD Inst. 29612). It includes Formative Evaluation;
Operational Evaluation; and Summative Evaluation.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 10       1 November 2002                                         145




Exportable Instruction. See Distance Learning.

External Evaluation. The acquisition and analysis of feedback data from outside
the formal training environment to evaluate the graduate of the instructional system
in an operational environment. Also called Field Evaluation. Also see Operational
Evaluation.

Feedback. Information that results from or is contingent upon an action. The
feedback does not necessarily indicate the rightness of an action; rather, it relates
the results of the action from which inferences about correctness can be drawn.
Feedback may be immediate, as when a fuse blows because a lamp is incorrectly
wired; or delayed, as when an instructor provides a discussion pertaining to an exam
taken the previous week, or when completed graduate evaluation questionnaires are
reviewed.

Fidelity. The degree to which a task or a training device represents the actual
system performance, characteristics, and environment.

Field Evaluation. See External Evaluation.

Formative Evaluation. An activity that provides information about the effectiveness
of educational materials to meet learning objectives and the student acceptance of
instructional materials as they are being developed. It is conducted while the
instructional system or course is still under development, to gather data on lessons,
units, or modules of instruction as they are completed. The purpose is to make
improvements to the system or course while development is still in progress. Also
see Evaluation.

Generalization. Learning to respond to a new stimulus that is similar, but not
identical, to one that was present during original learning. For example, during
learning a child calls a beagle and spaniel by the term "dog"; a child who has
generalized would respond "dog" when presented with a hound.

Instructional Objective. See Objective.

Instructional Strategy. An overall plan of activities to achieve an instructional goal.

Instructional System. An integrated combination of resources (students,
instructors, materials, equipment, and facilities), techniques, and procedures
performing effectively and efficiently the functions required to achieve specified
learning objectives.

Instructional System Developer. A person who is knowledgeable of the
instructional system development (ISD) process and is involved in the analysis,
design, development, implementation, and evaluation of instructional systems. Also
AFH 36-2235       Volume 10       1 November 2002                                         146


called Instructional Designer, Instructional Developer, Curriculum Developer,
Curriculum Development Manager, and other terms.

Instructional System Development (ISD). A deliberate and orderly, but flexible,
process for planning, developing, implementing, and managing instructional
systems. ISD ensures that personnel are taught in a cost-efficient way the
knowledge, skills, and attitudes essential for successful job performance.

Interactive Courseware (ICW). Computer-controlled instruction designed to allow
the student to interact with the learning environment through input devices such as
keyboards and light pens. The student's decisions and inputs to the computer
determine the level, order, and pace of instructional delivery, and forms of visual and
aural outputs. (May include CAI, CMI, CBI.)

Interactive Videodisc (IVD). A form of ICW instruction that specifically makes use
of videodisc technology. Video and audio signals are pressed onto the laser
videodisc; programming codes may or may not be pressed onto the disc depending
on the IVD level. As a result, motion sequence, still-frame shots, computer-
generated graphics, and audio may be displayed and heard through a monitor under
computer and user control.

Internal Evaluation. The acquisition and analysis of feedback and management
data from within the formal training environment to assess the effectiveness of the
instructional system. Also see Operational Evaluation.

Job. The duties, tasks, and task elements performed by an individual. The job is
the basic unit used in carrying out the personnel actions of selection, training,
classification, and assignment.

Job Aid. A checklist, procedural guide, decision table, worksheet, algorithm, or
other device used by a job incumbent to aid in task performance. Job aids reduce
the amount of information that personnel must recall or retain.

Job Analysis. The basic method used to obtain salient facts about a job, involving
observation of workers, conversations with those who know the job, analysis
questionnaires completed by job incumbents, or study of documents involved in
performance of the job.

Job Performance Requirements (JPR). The tasks required of the human
component of the system, the conditions under which these tasks must be
performed, and the quality standards for acceptable performance. JPRs describe
what people must do to perform their jobs.

Job Task Analysis. A process of examining a specific job to identify all the duties
and tasks that are performed by the job incumbent at a given skill level. Also called
Task Analysis.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 10       1 November 2002                                       147




Knowledge. Use of the mental processes which enable a person to recall facts,
identify concepts, apply rules or principles, solve problems, and think creatively.
Knowledge is not directly observable. A person manifests knowledge through
performing associated overt activities. Also see Attitude and Skill.

Learning. A change in the behavior of the learner as a result of experience. The
behavior can be physical and overt, or it can be intellectual or attitudinal.

Media. The delivery vehicle for presenting instructional material or basic
communication stimuli to a student to induce learning. Examples are instructors,
textbooks, slides, interactive courseware (ICW), and TV.

Metrics. Measurement tools used for assessing the qualitative and quantitative
progress of instructional development with respect to the development standards
specified.

Mission Analysis. A process of reviewing mission requirements, developing
collective task statements, and arranging the collective tasks in a hierarchical
relationship.

Motor Skill. Physical actions required to perform a specific task. All skills require
some type of action.

Norm-Referenced Test. The process of determining a student's achievement in
relation to other students. Grading "on the curve" involves norm-referenced
measurement since an individual's position on the curve (grade) depends on the
performance of other students. Generally, norm-referenced measurement is not
appropriate in the Air Force ISD process.

Objective. A statement that specifies precisely what behavior is to be exhibited, the
conditions under which behavior will be accomplished, and the minimum standard of
performance. Objectives describe only the behaviors that directly lead to or
specifically satisfy a job performance requirement. An objective is a statement of
instructional intent.

Operational Evaluation. The process of internal and external review of system
elements, system requirements, instructional methods, courseware, tests, and
process guide revision as needed to enhance the continued training effectiveness
and efficiency of the training system during full-scale operations. The process
begins at the training system readiness review and continues throughout the life of
the training system. It includes Internal Evaluation and External Evaluation. Also
see Evaluation.
Perceptual Skill. The process of information extraction; the process by which an
individual receives or extracts information from the environment through experiences
and assimilates this data as facts (sight, sound, feel, taste, smell).
AFH 36-2235       Volume 10        1 November 2002                                            148




Performance. Part of a criterion objective that describes the observable student
behavior (or the product of that behavior) that is acceptable to the instructor as proof
that learning has occurred.

Plan of Instruction (POI). A qualitative course control document designed for use
primarily within a school for course planning, organization, and operation. Generally,
criterion objectives, duration of instruction, support materials, and guidance factors
are listed for every block of instruction within a course. Also called Syllabus.

Posttest. A criterion-referenced test designed to measure performance on
objectives taught during a unit of instruction; given after the instruction. Also see
Criterion-Referenced Test.

Pretest. A criterion-referenced test designed to measure performance on objectives
to be taught during a unit of instruction and performance on entry behavior; given
before instruction begins. Also see Criterion-Referenced Test.

Psychomotor. A major area of learning that deals with acquiring physical skills
requiring dexterity, coordination, and muscular activity.

Reliability. (a) A characteristic of evaluation which requires that testing instruments
yield consistent results. (b) The degree to which a test instrument can be expected
to yield the same result upon repeated administration to the same population. (c)
The capability of a device, equipment, or system to operate effectively for a period of
time without a failure or breakdown.

Skill. The ability to perform a job-related activity that contributes to the effective
performance of a task. Skills involve physical or manipulative activities which often
require knowledge for their execution. All skills are actions having specific
requirements for speed, accuracy, or coordination. Also see Attitude and
Knowledge.

Subject Matter Expert (SME). (a) An individual who has thorough knowledge of a
job, duties/tasks, or a particular topic, which qualifies him/her to assist in the training
development process (for example, to consult, review, analyze, advise, or critique).
(b) A person who has high-level knowledge and skill in the performance of a job.

Summative Evaluation. The overall assessment of a program at the completion of
the developmental process. It is designed and used after the instructional system
has become operational. Also see Evaluation.

Syllabus. See Plan of Instruction.

System Approach to Training (SAT). Procedures used to develop instruction.
Each phase requires input from the prior phase and provides input to the next
AFH 36-2235       Volume 10       1 November 2002                                          149


phase. Evaluation provides feedback which is used to revise instruction. Also see
Instructional System Development.

Target Audience. The total collection of possible users of a given instructional
system; the persons for whom the instructional system is designed.

Task. A unit of work activity or operation which forms a significant part of a duty. A
task usually has clear beginning and ending points and directly observable or
otherwise measurable processes, frequently but not always resulting in a product
that can be evaluated for quantity, quality, accuracy, or fitness in the work
environment. A task is performed for its own sake; that is, it is not dependent upon
other tasks, although it may fall in a sequence with other tasks in a duty or job array.

Task Analysis. See Job Task Analysis.

Terminal Objective. An objective the learner is expected to accomplish upon
completion of the instruction. It is composed of enabling (support or subordinate)
objectives.

Training. A set of events or activities presented in a structured or planned manner,
through one or more media, for the attainment and retention of skills, knowledge,
and attitudes required to meet job performance requirements.

Training Needs Assessment (TNA). The study of performance and the
environment that influences it in order to make recommendations and decisions on
how to close the gap between the desired performance and the actual performance.

Validation. The process by which the curriculum materials and instructional media
materials are reviewed by the contractor for instructional accuracy and adequacy,
suitability for presentation, and effectiveness in providing for the trainees'
accomplishment of the learning objectives.

Validity. The degree to which a criterion test actually measures what it was
designed to measure.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 10      1 November 2002                                          150



    Attachment 2 – ISD and Learning Theory and Application to the
                         Learning Situation

Definition           Learning theory is the body of principles proposed by
                     psychologists and educators to explain how people learn skills,
                     knowledge, and attitudes.


Purpose in           You use these principles in formal instruction to help make
instruction          learning and retention faster, easier, more efficient and more
                     effective. Learning principles can guide developers in selecting
                     and sequencing learning activities within a course to improve its
                     effectiveness and efficiency.


Relation to ISD      Learning theory impacts instructional systems development in
                     several ways.

                     Many of the products specifically called for in the ISD phases
                     come from behavioral learning theory. In the 1950s, behaviorists
                     developed procedures for designing "programmed" instruction
                     that included:

                         Analyze and break down content into specific behavioral
                         objectives.
                         Determine procedures needed to achieve the objectives.
                         Try out and revise the steps.
                         Validate the program against the objectives.

                     This approach was incorporated into early ISD.

                     Instructional designers apply learning theory to select
                     instructional strategies for the type of learning required. To the
                     extent that there are real differences in the types of learning,
                     (e.g., intellectual skills, motor skills, or attitudes), different
                     instructional techniques may be needed.

                     Instructional designers look to learning theory to explain how
                     individuals differ in the way they learn. Understanding different
                     learning styles in order to target methods and materials to
                     individual students may become the most important theoretical
                     area for enhancing learning in the future.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 10       1 November 2002                                         151




Two basic theories   Instructional theorists and instructional technologists have been
                     shifting their interest over the last few decades away from the
                     behavioral learning model of stimulus-response-reinforcement
                     and toward the cognitive learning model of acquisition, storage,
                     and retrieval of knowledge.

                     Behavioral learning, which teaches students how to recognize
                     task cues and respond with actions, and reinforces learning
                     through feedback of successful task outcomes, remains an
                     effective means of training personnel to perform procedural tasks.
                     It is still appropriate for most Air Force training today.

                     Cognitive learning uses categories such as declarative,
                     procedural, and contextual, for organizing knowledge acquisition,
                     and categories such as cognitive complexity, recall, problem
                     solving, and creative processes, for knowledge retrieval and use.
                     Cognitive concepts play an important role in the development of
                     new technologies for delivery of instruction, such as expert
                     systems, in automated development tools, and in theories related
                     to adult learning, such as individual cognitive styles.


New directions       Researchers are investigating new approaches, such as including
                     a structural network analysis of the domain of information in the
                     analysis part of ISD, in order to improve the process of building
                     learning on previous learning. Such mapping would require the
                     availability of automated tools such as expert systems.

                     Other learning analyses predicted for future ISD applications,
                     such as matching instruction to learning style, are far beyond
                     current knowledge of learner differences, but they illustrate the
                     directions in which new technologies are driving instructional
                     design.

                          Applications to the Learning Situation


Introduction           Within real-world constraints, instructional designers can try to
                       design instructional programs and select learning contexts and
                       materials to implement learning principles.


Context variables      The context in which something is learned determines not only
                       what is learned but how it can be used. Learning is situated in
                       the context and gains meaning from that context. For example,
                       problem solving should occur in an authentic context. The fact
                       that information and principles learned are a part of solving real
                       problems will be better recalled when it is used again.


Cooperative            Social cognition psychologists feel that a learning context that
learning               promotes cooperative learning is more helpful to students than
                       one that promotes individual work, especially with regard to
                       learning attitudes.

                       Other psychologists see cooperative learning situations as
                       effective when the interaction between students can supply
                       learning support through tutoring and feedback. For example,
                       peer tutoring is an example of a technique for improving learning
                       in a particular type of learning context.


Learning activities    Students learn as they confront the response demands built into
                       activities. Good activities are built around the attainment of
                       multiple goals. They engage students in active forms of learning,
                       they help develop values and critical thinking skills, they are built
                       around important content, and they are well matched to the
                       learner's abilities and interests. Different types of instructional
                       delivery systems have been associated with particular
                       instructional contexts. For example, computer-assisted
                       instruction was considered most appropriate for individualized
                       instruction because it could provide for personalized instruction,
                       test for misunderstandings, and provide feedback. However, it
                       was also found that the computer can be an important part of
                       cooperative learning environments.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 10      1 November 2002                                        153




Technology           Emerging technologies like CD-ROM, videodisc, Internet, and
changes context      satellite conferencing change the context of instruction. This is
                     because technology not only delivers information, but it is also a
                     tool that can be used to enable information retrieval from
                     knowledge databases in ways other than printed text. The
                     encyclopedia on a CD-ROM or the Internet is not likely to be used
                     by a learner in the same way as the same encyclopedia in the
                     form of printed text.


Materials            The nature of the materials affects the stimuli that the learner
                     interacts with during the process of learning. Instructional
                     materials are often used in a broader context of an instructional
                     delivery system. A textbook, for example, is meant to be used
                     with a teacher. In most cases, the textbook does not provide
                     enough learning support; most students could not learn from it
                     without additional information. Broader instructional delivery
                     systems often provide a variety of instructional materials in what
                     are called multimedia environments. These environments might
                     include a live instructor or they might be totally mediated, as in a
                     computer-interactive video. Emerging technologies make
                     distinguishing between different types of materials difficult, but
                     the features of the delivery systems can be described in terms of
                     their capabilities for providing different stimuli, and different
                     "events" of instruction.

                     Events of instruction are a set of communications to the learner
                     embedded in instructional activities. They serve the function of
                     activating internal events of information processing. The events
                     of instruction are:

                         Gain attention.
                         Create goal expectancies.
                         Bring into working memory the prerequisites for learning the
                         new skill.
                         Present the stimulus for the new skill.
                         Provide learning support and guidance.
                         Check for understanding.
                         Remediate misunderstanding.
                         Verify learning.
                         Provide practice for retention and transfer.
AFH 36-2235        Volume 10      1 November 2002                                         154




One-on-One            In most cases, the most capable delivery system would be the
                      expert (instructor) working one-on-one with the learner on real
                      problems in a real situation. For example, if the skill to be
                      learned was leading a seminar, the most ideal situation would be
                      to have an expert observe the novice's performance and provide
                      a one-on-one critique. In this case, the instructor can provide for
                      all the events of instruction. But in other cases, group learning
                      may fulfill the educational requirement and some research has
                      shown that mediated learning may be more effective in achieving
                      certain affective learning objectives.


Classroom             Because of costs, the one-on-one delivery system is not often
instruction           used. The classroom delivery system with groups of students
                      and one instructor is more economical and can achieve the
                      desired objectives of learning. Using many variances and
                      combinations of approaches, the instructor can provide for all the
                      events of instruction.


Mediated materials    Different mediated learning systems have different capacities for
                      providing these events. For example, a videotape can elicit
                      learner responses to a question but is only capable of giving
                      rhetorical feedback. It is incapable of correcting learner
                      misunderstanding because it is incapable of judging whether the
                      response to a question was correct. However, by looking at
                      yourself on videotape you will be able to improve your delivery
                      and organizational skills in presenting a lesson to a class.


Physical objects      Situations that contain physical objects are the most concrete and
                      easy to understand because they don't require the translation of
                      symbols. When instruction is done with real objects, all the cues
                      for later performance are available. However, real situations may
                      be very complex, and it may be simpler to gain information from a
                      simplification of the real situation in the form of a mock-up or
                      simulation.

                      Learning situations utilizing physical objects call for the learner to
                      manipulate the objects. Through handling them, whether real
                      materials or simulations, the learners gain much information
                      about size, sturdiness, complexity, and other features. When the
AFH 36-2235         Volume 10      1 November 2002                                      155




Physical objects       learners are handling the object, they are building schemas of the
(Continued)            experience that may be important and may speed future learning.

                       Sometimes real materials are used in demonstrations by
                       instructors, but not used hands-on by students. A demonstration
                       makes the learner an observer of the expert handling the
                       equipment. This instructional technique usually involves the
                       transmission of a great deal of declarative knowledge about the
                       object being discussed, which the learner encodes and stores
                       with greater rapidity than in the handling environment.


Film and video         More abstract than physical objects are mediated materials, such
                       as film and video. These media generally have a linear format,
                       and information is paced by the delivery system. They usually
                       present a visual from an objective rather than a subjective point
                       of view, and they are edited to compress time. This removes
                       cues that are available from the real equipment and manipulation
                       activities. Most video instruction of procedures mediates
                       demonstrations.


Pictures and text      Most abstracts are still pictures, diagrams and printed text. In
                       order to understand text, you very often need to look at the real
                       object; and to understand the real object, you have to read the
                       text. The text is providing an instructional overlay that provides
                       the learner with the events of instruction that cannot be provided
                       by the object itself. On the other hand, the real object provides
                       the context for using the information from the text. Both are more
                       efficient when used together.


Printed text           The most abstract medium is printed text. To gain meaning from
                       printed text and illustrations, the learner should be able to read–
                       that is, decode–words. Furthermore, the learner must be able to
                       comprehend what is being said. Learning is more difficult
                       because temporal and physical cues are absent. The learner
                       cannot question the author when there is ambiguity in the
                       message. This is very noticeable in education since many
                       educational subject areas deal heavily with abstract ideas. On
                       the other hand, it is not perishable, can be restudied, and is more
                       precise.
AFH 36-2235    Volume 10       1 November 2002                                          156




Printed text      Printed text is generally "formal" and follows different rules for
(Continued)       communication than demonstrations or video instruction. This
                  formality makes printed text more difficult to understand. Authors
                  also vary in their ability to write clearly and use illustrations to
                  provide learning guidance.

                 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN LEARNING THEORY


Introduction         The following recent developments in learning theories have
                     marked importance for education and provide guidelines for the
                     instructional design process.


Adult learning       The literature on teaching adult learners has grown substantially
principles           in recent years and can be used to guide the specification of an
                     instructional system for adults. Knowles, in his 1987 publication
                     on Adult Learning, summarized the information about adult
                     learning and identified characteristics for effective instruction of
                     adults. Each of these characteristics has an implication for how
                     Air Force personnel should be educated and trained. An
                     underlying characteristic is that adults differ from children in how
                     they learn and, therefore, the process used for teaching adults
                     should differ from the process used for teaching children.

                         When compared to children, adult learners:
                            Want to know why they are being taught something.
                            Want to participate and control the learning experience.
                            Prefer active rather than passive learning experiences.
                            Have a greater repository of experience to which the new
                            learning can be related and bring greater diversity to
                            learning situations.
                            Prefer to set their own pace for learning.
                            Have a greater need for feedback on their learning.
                            Are more task-oriented.
                            Prefer a variety of instructional methods.
                            Like to determine the place and time of learning.

                         Knowles (1987) developed principles for teaching adults
                         based on characteristics of adult learners. Frequently cited
                         principles include:
                             Selection of objectives to meet the learner's needs
                             Variety of options built into the instruction
                             Frequent feedback on learners' progress
                             Task-oriented content
                             Ability to adapt to learner's self-paced learning
                             Frequent interaction

Schema theory /      The human mind requires that data have meaning. It rejects
mental models        nonsense and works actively to find or create meaning for the
                     perceptions it takes from the environment, using the contexts of
                     stored meanings that individuals build up during their lifetime.
                     Researchers in instruction have concentrated on this area of
                     cognitive activity, presumably because appropriate organization
                     and sequencing of content would facilitate the learner's
                     knowledge acquisition and processing activities. Thus, how a
                     person organizes and stores information coming from the
                     environment continues to be of importance to the instructional
                     design field.

                         Instructional theorists such as Bruner (1956), Ausubel (1968),
                         Anderson (1976), Norman (1975), Bobrow (1968), Reigeluth
                         (1983), and Merrill (1983) discuss the effects of cognitive
                         structures or schemas on acquisition and retention of
                         knowledge. They assume a hierarchical organization of
                         knowledge in memory from abstract and general to concrete
                         and specific, with linkages by which the information is related
                         within a knowledge structure. Networks or schemas refer to
                         the units of knowledge created by means of these linkages.
                         Norman and others have analyzed schemas to show how they
                         can be elaborated indefinitely in a hierarchical fashion to
                         attach new knowledge that alters the meaning of the original
                         conceptual unit.

                         Other researchers such as Mayer (1977) suggest that
                         schemas are simply sets of related cognitive knowledge
                         organized in some way, without necessarily presupposing a
                         hierarchical structure. This view is more consistent with the
                         variable ways the same material may be stored in memory,
                         e.g., loops, circles, linear strings, etc.

                         Simon (1979) also discusses organizational strategies in
                         problem-solving such as means-ends analyses or cognitive
                         structures, structures of goals and subgoals.
                         Jenkins (1973) suggests that elements of the material being
                         learned must be organized to constitute a strong personal
                         experience, which introduces the affective component of
                         learning.

                         Anderson (1985) described a schema as an organization of
                         memory elements (propositions, images, and attitudes)
                         representing a large set of meaningful information pertaining
                         to a general concept. The concept may be that of an object,
                         like a fighter-jet, a weapon, or an officer. Or it may be an

mental models            procedure. Regardless of type, schemas contain information
(Continued)              on certain well-understood features of the object or event.
                         These features, called slots, are filled in by the learner when
                         encountering new information that relates to the schema.
                         Schemas are acquired through experience and may be the
                         foremost benefit of apprenticeships.

                         Spears (1983) stressed that schemas in general have the
                         characteristics of learning sets (also referred to as
                         discrimination sets and learning to learn). He says, "The
                         phenomenon was recognized quite early in associationistic
                         psychology (Brown 1820), but its systematic experimental
                         study is usually dated from Harlow's (1949) review of
                         experiments by him and his coworkers that demonstrated the
                         empirical reality of learning sets. Their significance for
                         understanding complex behavior and learning was recognized
                         quite quickly in conceptions of cognitive processing." The
                         significance of schemas in learning theory comes from the
                         principle of building learning on learning. This is related both
                         to providing increasingly complex mental models in proficiency
                         development and adapting or accommodating learning styles.


Expert / novice      Researchers agree that there are strong differences between the
distinctions         performance of experts and novices on any given task or
                     problem, and an approach for looking at the personality variables
                     that affect learning involves analyzing the differences. There are
                     definite instructional implications for moving an individual from
                     novice to expert.

                         The study of what experts know and how they function
                         compared to what novices know and how they function can
                         guide the development of instruction. Information about what
                         experts know and how they work has been made more
                         important by new technology. For example, human expertise
                         can be captured and represented in a computer program, as is
                         the case with expert systems. Building expert systems
                         requires careful analysis of the knowledge experts possess in
                         a particular domain (Hannum 1990).
AFH 36-2235       Volume 10      1 November 2002                                        160




Expert / novice          In general, experts are distinguished by the amount of
distinctions             information they possess, how they organize their knowledge,
(Continued)              and how they select and use knowledge to solve problems.
                         When presented with problems, experts look for patterns,
                         underlying structures or principles, and similarities to known
                         problems. They try to reconfigure the problem or represent it
                         in a different way that allows them to solve it more easily
                         (Hannum 1990).

                         Identifying the characteristics of expert performance is
                         important in many areas of Air Force instruction, particularly in
                         the flying/aircrew training and technical training applications.
                         Shriver and Trexler (1984) discussed the performance
                         requirements of expert maintainers compared to those of
                         flyers in determining maintenance simulator design.

                         Maintenance experts have less need for coordinated complex
                         psychomotor skills. They require system concept
                         understanding and problem-solving ability. The expert
                         maintenance troubleshooter:
                            Uses system logic on generic functional knowledge.
                            Has comprehensive knowledge of specific systems.
                            Knows how to formulate hypotheses.
                            Knows where and how to test hypotheses.
                            Knows how to use test equipment.
                            Knows how to interpret test results.
                            Knows the physical location of parts of the system.
                            Is able to navigate the physical system to measure inputs
                            and outputs.
                            Knows the physical appearance of objects in the system.
                            Knows the symbolic representation of objects in
                            schematic diagrams and other maps.
                            Knows how to access components.
                            Knows failure probabilities.
                            Understands cost factors.
                            Knows safety factors.

                         Spears (1985) enumerated an extensive list of processes
                         which distinguish the mature professional aircrew from the
                         merely technically competent. He describes skill mastery and
                         emphasizes specific demands on aircrew members for
                         maintaining intense concentration, for performing under
                         pressure, and for resisting fatigue with its effects of
                         distractibility and degradation of skill coordination. He breaks

distinctions             into attention factors, skill knowledge, mediational processes,
(Continued)              and adaptability.

                         In later work Spears adapted the processes so that they are
                         broadly applicable to expert performers, for example, to pilots
                         and maintainers of complex equipment. He first lists
                         characteristics that experts possess and then indicates the
                         kinds of information-processing capacity needed for these
                         characteristics. Expert performers:

                              Stay ahead of the system.
                              Know where they are going, how to get there, and what
                              they will do when they arrive.
                              Can forecast outcomes of their actions, assess likely
                              outcomes ahead of time, and readily trade off alternatives
                              according to immediate and/or long-range performance
                              objectives.
                              Suffer minimum skill degradation over time.
                              Recover proficiency rapidly when degradation occurs.
                              Are aware of lack of "polish" in their performance during
                              or immediately following performance; they do not have to
                              be told.
                              Use minimum effort in performing skills; skills are
                              automatized, leaving attention for other purposes.
                              Suffer minimum intra- and interskill interference; time-
                              share readily.
                              Can manage heavy workloads.
                              Maintain performance under pressure; even manipulate
                              self-imposed pressure by "lying back" or "psyching"
                              themselves up as top performance requires.
                              Resist critical fatigue effects such as distractibility, lack of
                              sensitivity to less important cues, ill-timed actions, and
                              degradation of skill coordination.
                              Have abundance of relevant information immediately

                              Can recall key factors in a situation and their performance
                              several hours after an occurrence; thus can profit from

                              wrong."
                              Have skill knowledge that is patterned and "indexed" for
                              rapid access, jointly with respect to cuing patterns,
                              possible objectives, situational contingencies, and means-
                              end relations.
                              Have effective hierarchical organizations for patterns as
                              above.
                              Have integral, "organic" knowledge of skills and related
                              situational requirements, as opposed to a serial
                              knowledge of sequences of skill components.
                              Can achieve a one-to-one correspondence between
                              structure of conditions and job requirements, and the
                              structure of their recognition of requirements and resulting
                              performance (nothing significant is omitted in

                              Use hierarchical searches when matching patterns of
                              situations with memory (serial searches in this respect are
                              clear indicators of lack of expertise).
                              Can abstract pattern features rather than focus on literal
                              features of situations and skill requirements.
                              Rapidly discriminate among variants of feature patterns

                              Have hierarchical schemas for "chunking" cuing
                              information during performance and feedback during
                              monitoring; do not need to assess all feedback, but
                              reduce workload by keying on feedback pattern

                              Can retain a lot of information in short-term memory
                              through organizational processes that "chunk" information.

                         Spears notes that techniques are available for assessing all of
                         these characteristics. Indeed, this list is simply an adaptation
                         of characteristics of expertness as they have been identified in
                         laboratory studies.

                         Paul Johnson (Campbell 1983) described how expert
                         cardiologists organized sets of information to facilitate the
                         heuristic approach they used in diagnosis. The experts were
                         able to consider and discard hypotheses rapidly because of
                         the special way they stored information in memory. Novices,
                         on the other hand, had to work methodically through the
                         procedural steps of the diagnosis. The strategies and,
                         therefore, the organization of the same material vary with the
                         personality and style of the specialists. Johnson says that
                         individuals store information in memory in accordance with the
                         use they intend to make of the material (that is, its purpose),
                         and the organization is designed to support performance of
                         the tasks they are familiar with.


Knowledge transfer   Knowledge transfer is not only a cognitive but also an affective or
                     motivational issue.

                         Research on motivation suggests that mindfulness could be a
                         problem when transfer does not occur during problem-solving
                         (Salomon and Globerson, 1987). According to them, this
                         underlying construct of mindfulness is a state of mind that is
                         defined as the volitional, metacognitively guided employment
                         of non-automatic, usually effort-demanding processes. The
AFH 36-2235     Volume 10       1 November 2002                                     164




Knowledge transfer      distinction between mindfulness and mindlessness is based
(Continued)             on the distinction between controlled and automatic processes
                        (Schneider and Fisk 1984; Shiffrin and Schneider 1977).
                        Automatic processes are fast, effortless, smoothly carried out
                        in large chunks, not limited by the constraints of the central
                        processing capacity or working memory. They are usually
                        controlled by external cues to which they have been
                        associated through practice, or by internally overlearned
                        response. Thus, automaticity is associated with passive
                        processing. Controlled processes, on the other hand, are
                        slow, effort-demanding, relatively discrete, thus available to
                        analytic reflection (Kellog 1982; Langer and Imber 1980;
                        Lefebvre-Pinard and Pinard 1985), and volitionally controlled
                        by the individual (Kule 1985).

                        Introductory learning emphasizes rote memory, practice, and
                        automatic processing during the stage of advanced knowledge
                        acquisition. In contrast, mindful processes need to be
                        activated in order to enable individuals to:
                             Withhold or inhibit the evocation of a first response.
                             Examine and elaborate situational cues and underlying
                             meanings that are relevant to the task to be
                             accomplished.
                             Generate or define alternative strategies.
                             Gather information necessary for the choices to be made.
                             Examine the outcomes.
                             Draw new connections and construct new structures and
                             new abstractions by reflective mental processes.

                     Evidently, such behavior is typically controlled and volitional.
                     Therefore, the learning behavior required for knowledge transfer
                     in advanced knowledge acquisition is different from that of
                     introductory learning.

                        Studies on medical cognition (Feltovich, Spiro and Coulson
                        1988) and mathematical problem-solving (Schoenfeld 1985)
                        indicate that students often carry over the attitudes they have
                        in the introductory learning while learning complex and
                        advanced knowledge. According to Schoenfeld, in traditional
                        mathematical instruction teachers always hand down
                        problems which should be solved in an Avg of two minutes
                        each. Students who have been exposed to such instructional
                        approaches for an extensive period tend to believe that all the
                        mathematical problems must be solvable within a few minutes.
                        If they cannot solve problems immediately, it means
AFH 36-2235     Volume 10       1 November 2002                                          165


                       the problems can never be solved. This attitude is often found
Knowledge transfer     in students who fail to flexibly use their prior learned
(Continued)            knowledge while engaged in advanced knowledge acquisition.

                       Recently, there has been a great deal of research on cultural
                       influences on learning, including human intelligence (Gardner
                       and Hatch 1989; Sternberg 1986), cognitive skills (Brown,
                       Collins and Duguid 1989; Lave 1988; Rogoff and Lave 1984),
                       belief systems (Jehng 1990; Jehng and Johnson 1991), and
                       knowledge application (Feltovich, Spiro, and Coulson 1988;
                       Spiro, Coulson, Feltovich and Anderson 1988). Researchers
                       in this area suggest that human learning takes place in a
                       specific context, and knowledge is contextually welded. In the
                       school situation, learners develop an implicit sense of what is
                       suitable diction, what makes a relevant question, and what are
                       legitimate or illegitimate behaviors in a particular activity. The
                       ease and success with which learners behave obscure the
                       fact that what they get is a product of surrounding culture
                       rather than explicit teaching (Brown, Collins and Duguid
                       1989). In this sense, knowledge transfer could be regarded as
                       a process of decision-making in which individuals decide
                       whether learned knowledge ought to be applied in a certain
                       problem context.

                       Learner characteristics have received considerable attention
                       as a critical aspect of the skill and knowledge transfer
                       process. Understanding individual learning styles, for
                       example, could enable instruction to be tailored to present the
                       same content through a variety of methods. The intent is to
                       be able to present students methods and materials which are
                       optimal for them.

                       When the intention is to build knowledge upon knowledge, the
                       students' schemas of previously learned information on the
                       subject can be used effectively as a retrieval hook for the new
                       learning. Attitudes, another learner characteristic, are also
                       learned and held in schemas. Attitudes can be available for
                       change and adaptation to enhance instructional effectiveness
                       (Wager 1991).

                       Spears (1985) discusses some issues related to learning
                       styles of aircrew trainees. He suggests that accommodating
                       different styles in training is important, but it is also possible to
                       change individual styles. "Hence, there is the issue of whether
                       to accommodate all learning, to plan training that will alter
                       them, or simply to reject students with styles that are not
AFH 36-2235     Volume 10       1 November 2002                                        166


                       compatible with the techniques [selected]." Instructional
                       efficiency requirements may well preclude overemphasis on
                       learner differences.

Metacognition      Metacognition refers to one's knowledge or thought processes
                   about one's own cognition. It is the awareness and regulation of
                   our own thought processes. Learners often use their
                   megacognitive knowledge when they approach a new learning
                   task.


Metaskill          Metaskill, according to Spears, is a concept that organizes the
                   discrimination systems involved in complex performance and
                   points the way to effective and efficient training. It is defined for
                   present purposes as a high order generalized discrimination
                   system.

                       Metaskills govern which specific skills will be drawn on for
                       particular situations. They determine how cue complexes will
                       be sifted for pertinent information, how they will be interpreted,
                       how individual skills will be adapted to each situation, and how
                       self-monitoring of performance will occur so as to continue
                       skill adaptations to factors as they arise during performance.
                       They also include mechanisms for error detection and
                       avoidance. In brief, metaskill refers to skill in using separate
                       specific skills. One hears of the difference between a person
                       who has 10 years' experience and a person who had one
                       year's experience 10 times. The difference is in metaskill
                       development.

                       This fundamental concept can be directly targeted during
                       training. Metaskills develop separately from individual skills,
                       but they will not develop unless individual skills are practiced.
                       Further, whereas proficiency in individual skills relates to the
                       amount of practice on each skill, metaskills develop as a
                       function of the number of skills practiced, or of the number of
                       variations of them as required in many different situations.


Mastery approach   Researchers in the early 1990s investigated the processes and
vs. discovery      structures of competent performance in specific domains. To
learning           develop instructional programs to produce such competence,
                   Glaser (1990) reports that two dichotomous stances toward
                   instruction are reflected in such programs.

                       One stance is that of the master approach, which emphasizes
AFH 36-2235         Volume 10      1 November 2002                                         167


                           learning proceduralized knowledge through extensive practice
                           with problem-solving. The instructor controls the direction of


Mastery approach           learning and the learners follow a specific path of carefully
vs. discovery              structured subgoals leading toward the efficient performance
learning                   of a well-defined skill. Practice with successful performance is
(Continued)                thought to lead to subsequent metacognitive abilities.

                           Another stance toward instruction emphasizes self-regulated
                           control of learning strategies by the learner in accomplishing a
                           complete, non-decomposed task (Breuer and Kummer 1990).
                           With the discovery learning approach, the teacher provides
                           modeling of the metacognitive strategies necessary for
                           beginning the task and, when problems are encountered,
                           provides assistance. One learning procedure reflecting this
                           stance, called Reciprocal Teaching, structures collaborative
                           group work in sharing a complex problem-solving task. This
                           approach is based on theories about the social genesis of
                           learning in which the learner is characterized as being
                           motivated to seek explanations through explorations
                           (Tennyson and Breuer 1991).


Enterprise theory      Gagné and Merrill (1990) proposed a method to identify learning
                       goals that requires an integration of multiple objectives. They
                       proposed that such an integration of multiple objectives be
                       conceived in terms of the pursuit of a comprehensive purpose in
                       which the learner is engaged, called an enterprise.

                           When instruction is considered in the more comprehensive
                           sense of a module, section, or course, it becomes apparent
                           that multiple objectives commonly occur. In seeking a way of
                           dealing with multiple objectives other than serially, there is a
                           need for treating human performance at a somewhat higher
                           level of abstraction than is usual in most instructional design
                           models. People may learn facts, but what for? They may
                           learn new concepts, but how are these to function in the
                           context of the larger task that they as human individuals do?
                           Learners can acquire procedures, but in the context of what
                           larger scale activity? Performances may be described not
                           simply as steps in a sequence but also in terms of their
                           function and purpose in meeting the goal of an activity as a
                           whole.

                           An enterprise is a purposive activity that may depend for its
AFH 36-2235         Volume 10       1 November 2002                                              168


                           execution on some combination of verbal information,
                           intellectual skills, and cognitive strategies, all related by their
                           involvement in the common goal. A task for the instructional


Enterprise theory          designer is to identify the goal of a targeted enterprise along
(Continued)                with its component skills and knowledge, and then to design
                           instruction that enables the student to acquire the capability of
                           achieving this integrated outcome. Thus, learners may
                           acquire a fact or a concept that enables them to distinguish a
                           given object or set of objects. Or this fact or concept may be
                           part of a goal that enables them to communicate the stages of
                           some process. Or this fact or concept may be part of a goal
                           that enables them to predict the next in a process, to invent a
                           new device, or discover a new process. Each of these is a
                           different enterprise, and each is accordingly represented by a
                           different integrated goal. Each such enterprise requires a
                           different kind of integration of the multiple objectives that
                           support it.

                           Different integrated goals of various enterprises are
                           represented in memory as different kinds of cognitive
                           structures or schemas (Rumelhart and Norman 1978).
                           Integrated goals are the aims of human enterprises that
                           embody and integrate multiple objectives.

                           The enterprise schema is expected to contain a number of
                           knowledge and skill constituents which become associated in
                           the service of the integrated goal. These include verbal
                           labels, connected-discourse forms of verbal information,
                           intellectual skills, and cognitive strategies. Depending upon
                           the enterprise, motor skills and attitudes may also be involved.
                           The integrative goal itself is incorporated in the schema as
                           verbal knowledge. An important feature associated with the
                           goal is the enterprise scenario that relates component
                           activities (identifying concepts, carrying out procedures, etc.)
                           to the goal. It is the scenario that provides a basis for the
                           application of the constituent knowledge and skill in the
                           enterprise performance. This entire complex is what is meant
                           by the enterprise schema.

                           The instructional designer makes provision for the enterprise
                           goal in instruction by communicating the schema as verbal
                           information. This includes, on the one hand, identification of
                           the intellectual skills and verbal knowledge that relate to the
                           goal, and on the other, the scenario that must be played out in
AFH 36-2235         Volume 10       1 November 2002                                          169


                            conducting the enterprise. For example, instruction for the
                           enterprise of troubleshooting a piece of complex electrical
                           equipment would normally require conveying information
                           about the current flow in the system as a whole, the
                           identification of functioning (or malfunctioning) parts, and the


Enterprise theory          procedure for checking each of those parts. Problem-solving
(Continued)                strategies relevant to troubleshooting represent another type
                           of objective to be included. These individual knowledge and
                           skills would become a part of the scenario that expresses the
                           sequence and purpose of troubleshooting as checking the
                           fault symptom, finding a malfunctioning part, and replacing it.

                           Considering the great variety of goals that may be aimed for in
                           instruction, it does not appear feasible to try to identify them in
                           a comprehensive sense. However, there do appear to be
                           some common types (Gagné and Merrill 1990). One
                           commonly occurring type of purposive activity (enterprise)
                           consists of a kind of elaborated identifying, called denoting.
                           The integrative goal for denoting goes beyond pointing or
                           labeling. It may include demonstration of the rules
                           incorporated in the definition of some entity. Thus, in denoting
                           a class of objects such as "typewriter," the performer would
                           communicate not only its name and the appearance of the
                           object and its parts, but also the rules involved in its
                           functioning.

                           A second variety of enterprise involves teaching or "showing"
                           others (students, co-workers) the execution of steps in a
                           procedure or in a process. This is called manifesting. For
                           example, it may be the goal of the learner to show to others
                           the stages in the metamorphosis of a butterfly. Manifesting
                           this process may require a verbal narrative as well as the
                           demonstration of some rules; thus, the integration of multiple
                           objectives is involved. Still a third type of enterprise is
                           discovering. Problem solving or the finding of a novel process
                           may be taking place. Typically, both intellectual skills and
                           verbal information must be integrated in this kind of enterprise.
                           It may be that a number of other enterprises are of common
                           occurrence. Whatever particular purpose they serve, all of
                           them are instances of the integration of multiple objectives.

                           It is best to make provision for the activation of a goal well
                           toward the beginning of instruction. The second event of
                           instruction pertains to informing the learner of the objective.

                           When instruction consists of multiple objectives involved in an
                           integrated goal, this second event is carried out as follows: (1)
                           providing a verbal statement of a goal and its relation to
                           prerequisite skills, knowledge, and attitudes; and (2) giving a
                           verbal description of a scenario that relates whatever is to be
                           newly learned to the goal.


Enterprise theory          These verbal communications about the goal appear relatively
(Continued)                simple and yet adequate to establish a goal schema. Of
                           course, they should be related insofar as possible to the
                           individual learner's prior experience and motivation. The
                           establishment of a goal schema may be expected to make a
                           significant addition to the metacognitive resources available to
                           the learner. As such it has the function of monitoring the new
                           learning–keeping it "on track," free of distractions, and
                           rejecting attention to irrelevant events. When learning has
                           progressed to a point at which performance is to be exhibited,
                           the schema aids in the retrieval of prerequisite knowledge and
                           skills. Furthermore, throughout its scenario, the schema
                           supports mindful abstraction and, thus, enhances transfer of
                           learning to the performances involved in the enterprise. The
                           result of integrating enterprises for the learner is the metaskill.
                           The metaskill is based on learning hierarchies which the
                           individual can recall to meet the requirements of the novel
                           situation being presented.

     Attachment 4 – An Example of Implementing the ISD Process:
             The Wing Company Grade Officer Course
NOTE: The following example is designed to illustrate how the ISD process was used
to develop a completely new course of instruction. The descriptions given for each of
the first three phases of the ISD process are relatively concise. In reality, the amount of
effort expended in each phase of the process was considerably greater than these
descriptions suggest. but, for the sake of brevity and space, what is described is
essentially a synopsis of all the work that occurred in each phase.

The Instructional System Development (ISD) process is the basic tool utilized in
planning, developing, and evaluating the Wing Company Grade Officer Course
(WCGOC). The following topics are key to the WCGOC development and execution
efforts:

Phase I -- Analyze and determine what instruction is needed.

   Review 1996 Fall CORONA identification of several concerns within the officer
   corps. Analysis determined a need to improve and broaden the professional
   competence of company grade officers so they may better perform their duties in
   support of Air Force Global Engagement and associated mission requirements.
   Additional analysis indicated a clear need for lieutenants to understand how
   operational, logistics, support, and medical elements function at wing level.

   Gather information to determine instructional requirements of lieutenants to meet
   junior officer needs. Survey conducted concluded that 44 of 61 (72%) of CONUS
   bases contacted had courses of different varieties. Contact with junior and senior
   officers identified a need for nonresident instruction for lieutenants. The identified
   lieutenants needs were to better understand how operational and support elements
   at the wing level function and the junior officers’ roles in this process.

   Based on data, discussions and course developer experience, an overall planned
   course of action was developed to educationally increase the lieutenants value to
   the local unit by understanding and applying interoperability between wing units.

   A typical student profile, further established a need for a distance learning (vice
   resident instruction) professional military education course. An added need was to
   develop a broad perspective of current wing issues and associated skills aimed at
   enhancing professional competence beyond one’s own specialty.

   The difference between what lieutenants already knew and could do and what wing
   requirements required, also helped to determine instruction needed. Formative
   evaluation of process and concept assessment was accomplished through
   discussions with commanders’ seminar, Squadron Officer School (SOS), major
   commands, Air War College (AWC) students, Aerospace Basic Course (ABC),
   Board of Visitors (BOV), Command Board of Advisors (CBOA), and installation
AFH 36-2235      Volume 10       1 November 2002                                       172


   leadership. The major focus in Phase I is to clearly determine the desired learning
   outcomes, e.g., skills and knowledge required of a lieutenant within the first 6 – 12
   months of assignment at a wing or equivalent unit.

   The bulk of resources required to support instruction were to be provided by the
   installations concerned.

   Phase II – Design instruction to meet the need.

   Determine what essential educational requirements should influence the WCGOC
   curriculum action. Two factors of high priority impacted this decision:

      New officers graduating from a largely academic precommissioning environment
      require a real world practical experience to standardize officership training .

      Provide a standardized nonresident course for all Company Grade Officers
      (CGOs) that is responsive to the challenging needs of today’s lieutenants.

   Develop a WCGOC curriculum plan in the AU format approved for College for
   Professional Development (CPD) courses. This detailed plan of instruction should
   include Part I: course description and Part II: course of study – overview and Part
   III: detailed course of study. This format included areas of instruction, educational
   goals, periods of instruction, and evaluation.

   Three factors were instrumental in driving the design phase:

      WCGOC is part of the AU Continuum of Education.

      WCGOC is a key element of a Wing mentoring program.

      Forty hours of classroom instructional material should be provided.

   The basic implementation plan for the WCGOC also considered the following
   essential design factors:

      Target audience is line and non-line lieutenants and direct-appointment captains
      with 6 – 12 months at their first duty stations.

      Primary teaching tool is to facilitate learning: Socratic method and guided
      discussion.

      Other methods: group exercises, case studies, tours, and briefings.

      Facilitator is a guide and advisor.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 10       1 November 2002                                         173


   WCGOC management process. Establish a nonresident management and
   accountability system. This should include but not be limited to:

       Role of Wing Commander and Company Grade Officer Council.

       WCGOC Course Director, facilitators, and students.

       Enrollment process at unit of first assignment.

       Course completion record keeping process.

   Formative evaluation consisted of senior officer review, AU/CC assessment, CBOA
   briefings/feedback, BOV, and commander’s seminar evaluation. In Phase II,
   evaluation should be directed toward process and product evaluation and the
   achievement of required outcomes. This control element is aimed at reaching the
   predefined outcomes addressed in this phase of the ISD process.


Phase III – Develop instructional materials to support system requirements.

   Develop WCGOC support materials. Example: Course Directors’ Guide,
   Facilitator’s Guide, Student’s Guide, Reading List, Lesson Plans, PowerPoint Slides,
   Course Schedule, Wing Commander’s Introduction, Reading Material / Cases /
   Exercises.

   Update implementation plan to include topics aligned to each area of instruction.
   Prepare lesson plan for each instructional lesson.

   Conduct course field validations at about thirteen bases. CPD/CC to submit interim
   reports of field validations to AU/CC. Validation should consist of review of course
   instruction and materials (formative evaluation). Develop instrument to accomplish
   this critical validation. This should be accomplished by individual and WCGOC
   student tryouts. Summative evaluation should consist of macro assessment to
   include discussion with wing commanders, senior leadership, and supervisors.

   At the time of this writing, WCGOC validation is still in progress. Course
   development remains in Phase III.

   Based on all validation feedback, the course continues to be revised, including all
   materials and processes as appropriate.
