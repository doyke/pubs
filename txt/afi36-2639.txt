1. Overview
    1.1. The EWI program is a career development program designed to improve the
    management abilities and technical and professional competencies of participating students
    by partnering with industry to accomplish career-specific desired learning objectives (DLOs)
    established by career field managers (CFMs) (further discussed in section 17). The USAF
    derives benefit from first-person insight into the philosophy, procedures and practices of
    industry. The students fully examine industry policies and processes, as well as how industry
    addresses issues. In doing so, students acquire the ability to interpret the needs of the USAF
    in industry terms. By studying the best practices of industry, students are able to bring new
    knowledge, understanding, and empathy back into the USAF to improve its processes. This
    direct insight and experience are unavailable elsewhere in the USAF. In turn, the company
    benefits by receiving the student’s Air Force experience and perspective.
    1.2. The Air Force EWI program is a highly selective, competitive non-degree educational
    assignment within an industry associated with the student’s career field. The program is a
    10-month SAF/AQ-sponsored, USAF training program that specializes in corporate
    partnerships with defense and non-defense related industry leaders throughout the continental
    United States. Students selected for this program are considered Air Force-level students in
    accordance with AFI 36-2406, Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems.
    1.3. The EWI Handbook is the best resource to use for detailed, up-to-date guidance for the
    EWI program.         It can be downloaded from the AFIT EWI webpage at
    https://www.afit.edu/cip/docs/EWI_Handbook.pdf. The EWI Community of Practice
    (CoP), located on the Air Force Portal, also provides current information, resources and a
    means of communication for registered users, be they EWI students, company coordinators
    or CFMs at https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/EntryCoP.asp?Filter=OO-ED-AF-06.
    1.4.      The officer and civilian opportunities are released annually by AFPC
    Message/Nomination Call by career field and Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) and are
    listed in the EWI Handbook.
    1.5. As part of the program, officers normally PCS to and from the company location.
    Civilians are assigned to companies near their current duty location without a PCS or TDY
    cost to the government, remaining on their current duty position. Vicinity travel is not
    authorized.
