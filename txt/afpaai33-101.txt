   recommended for replacement, and replace parts if needed. Do not automatically replace
   items based only on hours usage.
2.4. Unscheduled Maintenance. Equipment malfunctions, Awaiting Parts (AWP), Equipment
Inoperable for Parts (EIP) and awaiting maintenance (AWM) status, mission essential equipment
and off-air conditions, contract repair and warranty repair, cannibalization/transfer of parts,
equipment and system modifications, non-equipment repairable items.
   2.4.1. Open a job on any report or observation of malfunctioning equipment or systems as
   soon as possible, even if the solution to the problem can be determined and performed
   immediately.
   2.4.2. Use AFTO Form 350, or equivalent, to identify equipment with open jobs AWP, EIP
   or AWM. Remove inoperable individual equipment items from system.
   2.4.3. Equipment in AWP/EIP Status. Store equipment in an area within the maintenance
   work center clearly identified for these items. Upon receipt of parts, install as soon as
   possible and return equipment to appropriate system. Equipment with minor malfunctions,
   such as broken knobs or burned out bulbs, may remain in the system with an AFTO Form
   350, or equivalent, clearly identifying the job opened against it.
   2.4.4. Equipment in AWM status. Equipment AWM will be stored in an area clearly marked
   for AWM. All AWM equipment will have a job opened against it and an AFTO Form 350,
   or equivalent attached. Assign technicians to work on equipment in AWM status as soon as
   possible. Request assistance from other units or HQ AFPAA when troubleshooting time
   becomes excessive.
   2.4.5. Mission Essential Outages. Subordinate units notify the Maintenance Superintendent,
   via e-mail or telephone, when needing assistance with mission essential outages affecting
   capability to provide service. Request assistance from HQ AFPAA, if needed, to procure
   parts to return equipment to operational status.
2.5. Contract Repair.

   only when equipment repairs are beyond the work center’s capabilities. Verify equipment
   warranty prior to completing any maintenance action.
2.6. Cannibalization and Transfer/Turn in of Parts/Equipment.
   2.6.1. Cannibalization. T.O. 00-20-2-WA-1, Maintenance Data Documentation, outlines the
   cannibalization process and documentation requirements. Most maintenance situations at the
   subordinate unit do not meet the requirements to be considered cannibalization. According
   to T.O. 00-20-2, assemblies, sub-assemblies, or parts obtained from spare C-E equipment to
   repair off-equipment (off-system) items are considered transfers and are not treated as
   cannibalization actions.
   2.6.2. Transfer of Parts/Equipment. Before resorting to a transfer action, ensure the part is
   not currently available in spare parts kits, work order residue or shop stock. Place a demand
   on the supply system or use the government purchase card to purchase the item. If a spare
   equipment item is available, replace the failed equipment with the complete spare equipment
   item and order parts to repair the faulty equipment.

               MAINTENANCE WORK CENTER TRAINING PROGRAM

7.1. Introduction. Qualified technicians are vital to properly maintain and restore mission
systems. Effective work center training programs produce qualified technicians. Effective
training programs are measured by the results produced, such as system or equipment operational
rates, inspection reports, work center task coverage, trainee upgrade rates, and the ability to
implement policy changes and new technical procedures.
7.2. Effective Training Program. To establish and maintain effective work center training
programs, work center supervisors will:
   7.2.1. Perform supervisor responsibilities listed in AFI 36-2201. Read and become familiar
   with AFI 36-2201 and AFI 36-2101.
   7.2.2. Ensure each training record is updated a minimum once a month for personnel in
   qualification training and once a week for personnel in upgrade training (use TBA for this
   function). Documentation must state improvements, de-certifications, re-certifications, and
   deviations from the training schedule.
   7.2.3. Identify work center task training requirements. Determine all training required for
   100 percent equipment coverage. Develop a work center training plan. Include the following
   items:
       7.2.3.1. Master Task List (MTL) including all tasks required in the work center. (See
       paragraph 7.2.5.)
       7.2.3.2. List of recurring training requirements.
       7.2.3.3. Local task breakdowns and training aids.
       7.2.3.4. Specific tasks for additional duties. (Use an AF Form 797, Job Qualification
       Standard Continuation/Command JQS, for each additional duty.)
       7.2.3.5. Milestones for tasks and Career Development Course completion.
   7.2.4. Identify supervisory tasks. This combines technical tasks needed to supervise and
   manage a crew, team, or work center.
   7.2.5. Develop a work center MTL to include management actions and additional duties, for
   military personnel and ensure training guides developed by trainers meet the units training
   needs and ensure 100 percent task coverage. Use the current 3D1X2 Career Field Education
   and Training Plan (CFETP), any mandatory AFJQSs and AFQTPs, and any command or
   local AF Form 797s. The MTL, as a minimum, will identify all core tasks (tasks mandatory
   for performing assigned duties within the unit).
   7.2.6. Perform initial evaluations of newly assigned individuals within 60 days of
   assignment. Accomplish this to determine task certification and identify qualification
   training requirements. Technicians certified by another work center on tasks applicable to
   their new duty station must demonstrate proficiency on a sampling of those tasks.
   7.2.7. Develop and update a training schedule for each trainee. Determine the most
   convenient and effective method to document, disseminate, and monitor individual work
AFPAAI33-101 13 JUNE 2013                                                                         17


   center training schedules. Make every effort to meet scheduled training goals when mission
   requirements and unforeseen situations affect schedule compliance. Integrate on-the-job
   training (OJT) with day-to-day work center operations.
   7.2.8. Observe training sessions frequently to ensure the training is on schedule, meets the
   trainee’s needs, and achieves work center training objectives.
   7.2.9. Establish and use local task breakdowns, training aids, and specific tasks for
   additional duties.
7.3. Formal Training. Evaluate individuals when they complete formal training and complete
the graduate assessment survey. Use the Customer Service Information Line to report formal
training deficiencies. Refer to the cover page of the applicable training standard for the specific
telephone number to use.
   7.3.1. Ensure trainers and certifiers have attended a formal trainer/certifier course and
   trainers stay qualified on tasks for which they train others.
   7.3.2. Ensure the validity of task qualification and certification directives by the following
   methods:
       7.3.2.1. Ensure technicians do not perform maintenance tasks on which they are not
       certified unless directly supervised by a task certification technician. Inadequately
       trained technicians are more likely to commit errors resulting in injury or loss of mission
       equipment. Supervisors must ensure trainees are qualified before certification.
       7.3.2.2. Ensure trainees fully understand and believe they can perform the task safely and
       correctly before agreeing to task certification.
       7.3.2.3. Immediately decertify individuals who cannot perform a task. Work center
       supervisors determine if the individual requires re-certification on the task.
       7.3.2.4. Ensure trainees are certified on only those tasks they are required to perform.
   7.3.3. Identify formal training needs based on work center mission requirements, trainee
   qualifications, and lack of OJT capability.
       7.3.3.1. Request unit education and training manager help to identify, coordinate, and
       schedule formal training.
       7.3.3.2. Identify recurring training requirements (e.g., backup generator, fire
       extinguisher, cardio pulmonary resuscitation, Self-Aid Buddy Care, etc.).
       7.3.3.3. Assess the impact of significant training difficulties on the work center’s
       maintenance capabilities.

                                        Attachment 2
           AFPAA MAINTENANCE QUALITY CONTROL CHECKSHEETS

A2.1. Introduction. AFPAA CQCCs are separate from Air Force Communications Quality
Control Checksheets (AFCQCCs) and are referred to in this attachment as CQCCs. They are
similar to AFCQCC and are guides used to help determine equipment condition and
serviceability. Work center and staff functions can use CQCCs when performing self-
inspections. AFPAA CQCCs are standardized and published on AF Form 3900, Quality Control
Checksheet when possible. CQCCs are not directive. Units may create local CQCCs for subject
areas not covered by an AFPAA CQCC. Submit proposed local CQCCs to AFPAA/SC for
publication. Refer to T.O. 00-33A-100, for more information.
A2.2. General Equipment CQCCs. Minor and common pieces of equipment may not need a
separate CQCC, but may be covered by general-type CQCCs as follows:
   A2.2.1. Similar items of equipment (such as fuse panels, station batteries, panels, power
   supplies, etc…) may be included in a general CQCC. They contain those checks common to
   all or most of the similar equipment items. If required, subordinate units may add additional
   checks for an individual equipment type.
   A2.2.2. Use general checksheets in conjunction with equipment specific checksheets.
A2.3. Local CQCCs. AFPAA Chief of Maintenance authorizes the use of local CQCCs with
more than five critical performance checks. Subordinate units forward local CQCCs meeting
this criteria to AFPAA for processing. All others may be created and retained locally. Local
CQCCs are conspicuously marked or labeled as local CQCCs. Do not retain or use local CQCCs
after an AFPAA CQCC is published on the same item of equipment, grouping of equipment
(General Equipment CQCC), or management function.
A2.4. Functional Grouping. CQCCs are organized by series designator number for major
functional and equipment categories. AFPAA CQCC category numbers differ from AFCQCC
guidance somewhat to simplify management of AFPAA unique systems. AFPAA CQCC
numbering is as follows:

Table A2.1. Functional Grouping
 Maintenance Management            100 Series
 Specialized Inspections           200 Series
 Audio Equipment                   300 Series
 Video Equipment                   400 Series
 Miscellaneous Equipment           500 Series
 Transmission Standards            600 Series
A2.5. AFPAA/SC Responsibilities. AFPAA/SC manages the AFPAA CQCC program for
standard equipment/systems at subordinate units. AFPAA/SC will:
   A2.5.1. Maintain a record copy of all published AFPAA CQCCs.
   A2.5.2. Assign CQCC control numbers as appropriate, and forward new CQCCs to all
   subordinate units.
 22                                                         AFPAAI33-101 13 JUNE 2013


   A2.5.3. Publish CQCCs and changes to standard CQCCs as required.
   A2.5.4. Format CQCCs according to this attachment. (Updated CQCCs are treated as new
   publications and distributed to each subordinate unit.)
   A2.5.5. Annually review appropriate CQCCs for continued need, accuracy and currency.
   A2.5.6. Coordinate changes with subordinate units to evaluate and validate CQCCs before
   final approval.
   A2.5.7. Determine AFPAA wide applicability of local CQCCs submitted by subordinate
   units.
   A2.5.8. Return to subordinate units, proposed CQCCs not meeting the criteria above or
   formatted IAW paragraph A2.4. for correction, update, or local use as appropriate.
   A2.5.9. Coordinate with LG on the implementation of this program.
A2.6. Proposed CQCCs from subordinate units.
   A2.6.1. Subordinate units will:
      A2.6.1.1. Create proposed CQCCs using an electronic word processing format IAW TO
      00-33A-1001, paragraph 10.6.8.g.
      A2.6.1.2. Use AFCQCC and Headquarters Air Force checklists as a template for Local
      CQCC creation.
      A2.6.1.3. Ensure evaluation and field-testing for proposed CQCCs have been completed
      prior to forwarding to AFPAA/SC.
      A2.6.1.4. Forward proposed CQCCs to AFPAA/SC for processing.
A2.7. Changes to CQCCs. Changes (except for minor punctuation and spelling errors) are
accomplished as CQCC revisions. The complete CQCC is re-accomplished and processed in the
same manner as new CQCCs. Subordinate units send recommended changes to AFPAA/SC.
AFPAAI33-101 13 JUNE 2013                                                                    23

         AFPAA COMMAND AND LOCAL MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS

A3.1. Command Maintenance Instructions. Command maintenance instructions (CMIs) will
be written on all major systems and fielded to all subordinate units. CMI frequency is
determined by manufacturer’s recommendation as well as input from the project engineer and
AFPAA owned and operated units.
A3.2. AFPAA Responsibilities. When a system is installed at a subordinate unit AFPAA/SC
will:
   A3.2.1. Review current LMIs for applicability and development into a CMI.
   A3.2.2. Task a subordinate unit to test the proposed CMI.
   A3.2.3. Review and combine the recommended changes with the proposed CMI and publish
   the official CMIs quarterly.
   A3.2.4. Post approved CMIs to AFPAA HQ Maintenance sharepoint site.
   A3.2.5. Post CJQS to Task Training Table and notify all subordinate units of new task
   numbers.
   A3.2.6. Process and publish CMI changes and maintain record copies. If an LMI is
   approved for a system and the system later becomes standard, AFPAA/SC will publish a
   CMI to replace the LMI and dispose of any LMI superseded by a CMI.
A3.3. Combat Camera Responsibilities.
   A3.3.1. Subordinate units will develop a draft CJQS using AF Forms 797, Job Qualification
   Standard Continuation/Command JQS, IAW AFI 36-2247 and submit it to AFPAA/SC no
   later than 90 days after installation.
   A3.3.2. Subordinate units will begin using the CMIs upon release.
   A3.3.3. Subordinate units will send in proposed changes to AFPAA/SC as needed.
A3.4. Local Maintenance Instructions. LMIs will be written for all non-standard systems
installed at subordinate units. LMIs may be used to develop CMIs when systems become
standard at two or more subordinate units. Inspection requirements dictated by local conditions,
such as special use or geographic location, may also be written as an LMI.
   A3.4.1. LMI Development Requirements.
       A3.4.1.1. Forward copy of LMI to AFPAA/SC for approval prior to use.
       A3.4.1.2. Subordinate units will develop a draft local JQS utilizing AF Forms 797, IAW
       AFI 36-2247 for each LMI submitted for approval.
A3.5. Numbering and Indexing. AFPAA CMIs/LMIs are numbered in three series. Use the
100-series for instructions of a general nature, 200-series for special maintenance instructions
and temporary modifications, and 300 through 600-series for inspection, servicing, and
lubrication requirements and operational performance checks. This numbering system differs
only slightly from the AFCEMI numbering system for better control and management of unique
 24                                                           AFPAAI33-101 13 JUNE 2013


AFPAA equipment and systems. Local LMIs will be identified by starting the last 3 numbers of
the LMI with the numbers 100-199.
