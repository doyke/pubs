student’s flying squadron of this either by telephone conference or via a copy of AF IMT 1042,
Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty (or another Service’s
equivalent). Simulation training during DNIF status may be acceptable, and the FS should
address this on AF IMT 1042. The appropriate supervisor will approve dental and FS
examinations (other than sick call and emergencies) before scheduling a dental or FS
appointment.
3.8. (Added) Stan/Eval Checkrides.
3.8.1. (Added) . When syllabus missions requiring a flight examiner (FE) are “NE/SNP”, those

used for course accounting. This summary is a GTIMS equivalent of the AETC Form 901,
Training Record.
4.4.3.5. (Added) The following items from the electronic gradebook are not automatically
included when running the ATJ (Flt/CCs should ensure these forms are included with the
student’s gradebook): LAFB Form 7, AETC Form 904, AETC Form 6, ADD-ride

4.4.4.1.2. (Added) . For students eliminated from training, complete and attach AETC Form
904. Write end-of-phase summaries for completed phases. Annotate “Removed from training
(date)” after the end of course summary.
4.4.4.2. (Added) FCMs will produce a class graduation letter for each class. For non-flying
courses, the ACM will prepare and provide the graduation letter. Include the following
information in the class graduation letter:
4.4.4.2.1. (Added) Class number, scheduled/actual graduation date, course ID, and reason for
any deviation from the scheduled graduation date.
4.4.4.2.2. (Added)    List of graduates by name, rank, and next assignment (wing and base
designations only).
4.4.4.2.3. (Added) Comments/recommendations concerning problem areas.
4.4.4.2.4. (Added) Number of students entered training.
4.4.4.2.5. (Added) Number of students graduated.

4.4.4.3. (Added) The Flt/CC will complete an AETC Form 904 for each student in all formal
training classes (B Course, TX, SOC, FAC, etc). A squadron supervisor will review the form.
Exception: Students in academic only classes do not require AETC Forms 904. The FCM will
include all AETC Forms 904 for each class.
4.4.4.3.1. (Added) Supervisors will ensure the entries on the AETC Form 904 reflect actual
student performance. The comments should be written to provide gaining supervisors a clear
picture of the student’s performance and SHOULD NOT be written like an OPR.
AETCI36-2205V6_LUKEAFBSUP 7 AUGUST 2013                                                      11


4.4.4.3.2. (Added) See the “56 OG Shared Documents” link on the 56 OG Sharepoint for the
latest       formatting        guidance  for     the       AETC        Form        904:

px.
4.4.4.3.3. (Added) End of Phase Summaries section: Contains a brief description of the
student's characteristic flying performance in each phase. Use the following evaluation scale to
assess the student's overall performance in the phase: Above Average, Slightly Above Average,
Average, Slightly Below Average, Below Average.
4.4.4.3.3.1. (Added) Cite specific strengths, weaknesses, areas of improvement, and general
attitude, as required.
4.4.4.3.3.2. (Added) When two or fewer sorties constitutes a phase, entries may be combined
with another phase (e.g., Transition/Air-to-Air).
4.4.4.3.3.3. (Added) Supervisors should annotate non-effective sorties for SNP.
4.4.4.3.4. (Added) End of Course Summary section: Contains a brief description of the
student's overall flying performance during the course.
4.4.4.3.4.1. (Added) Include an overall evaluation of the student's judgment, situational
awareness, flight discipline, and general airmanship. Make an accurate evaluation of student
performance to be used by the gaining unit so they may determine appropriate levels of
supervision. Supervisors must ensure the entries reflect actual student performance.
4.4.4.3.4.2. (Added) Include an assessment of performance trends throughout the course and a
subjective evaluation of the degree of supervision the student will require at the gaining unit.
4.4.4.3.4.3. (Added) Annotate course awards in this section (e.g., Distinguished Graduate, Top
Gun).
4.4.4.3.4.4. (Added) Include a statement listing any flying qualification the student did not
achieve in accordance with the respective syllabus “Status Upon Graduation” paragraph. For
example, “Not qualified in ACBT, Night AAR, and LOWAT Cat 1.” A reference to any
applicable waiver should also be included.
4.4.4.4. (Added) Education / Training Reports (AF IMT 475).
4.4.4.4.1. (Added) Complete the AF IMT 475 forward for signature and include it in student
personnel records in accordance with AFI 36-2406, Officer and Enlisted Evaluation System.
4.4.4.4.1.1. (Added) Refer to AFI 36-2406 for additional guidance on submission, preparation,
and routing of the AF AMT 475. The SQ/CC or designated representative of equal or higher
grade than the student should sign these forms.
4.4.4.4.1.2. (Added) The AF IMT 475 is used to document officer student performance for
courses scheduled for 8 weeks or more. This TR will become a permanent part of the officer’s
record and will ensure consistency in documenting training. This TR should use the period of
report dictated by AFI 36-2406. Generally, the “FROM” date depends upon the thru date of the
previous report and is not the course start date at Luke. The “THRU” date includes top-off Luke
training , and should match the date the 56 TRS/SR has for graduation. Actual dates on base will
not be used.
 12                                     AETCI36-2205V6_LUKEAFBSUP 7 AUGUST 2013


4.4.4.5.1.3. (Added) It is imperative that supervisors understand the impact TRs have on an
officer’s career, similar to OPRs. Therefore, supervisors completing TRs for the first time will
receive training to ensure the TR is properly written and processed.
4.5. (Added) GTIMS Training Jacket.
4.5.1. (Added) Instructors will complete a gradesheet to document any syllabus sortie/device,
“X” or ADD sortie, additional device training, or progress check. If possible, gradesheets should
be completed immediately after the debrief, but no later than the student’s next graded event.
Write gradesheets primarily to the next instructor using plain English and common acronyms as
required. When documenting Regressions or SNPs, consider including specific verbiage from
the applicable Course Training Standards.
4.5.2. (Added) If GTIMS becomes unavailable due to extreme circumstances (e.g., LAN out,
power failure) document applicable mission tasks and syllabus directed CRM items on a blank
AETC Form 900. The IP of record (primary) or FLT/CC (secondary, under extenuating
circumstance) is then responsible for entering the gradesheet into GTIMS at the earliest
opportunity.
4.5.3. (Added) Instructors will grade all opted “Mission Tasks” in accordance with the
syllabus. Non-opted items may be graded when noteworthy, and must be graded when a
previously met milestone task is below CTS (regression), or when any task is dangerous.
4.5.4. (Added) All GTIMS Training Jacket grade sheets will be filled out IAW the Grade
Sheet 101 PowerPoint presentation produced and updated by 56 TRS/TD. This presentation can
be accessed via the Flight Commanders’ button at the top of the GTIMS main page, or on the
56TRS Sharepoint.
4.5.5. (Added) Individual grades: Grade individual maneuvers in accordance with CTS and
the applicable syllabus. Overall grade for that item should reflect the average of the individual
items. For example, if there are five sub-items graded items under one major item (i.e., Inflight
Checks), the overall grade for the major item should reflect the preponderance of the five (three
1’s and two 2’s would equal an overall major grade of 1 for Inflight Checks).
4.5.6. (Added) Assign an overall grade of “NG” to any mission which is NE/Other. Mission
items flown and graded on the first mission are not required to be re-accomplished on the repeat
mission.
4.5.7. (Added) Questionable Performance: When any doubt exists as to a student's
demonstrated performance and ability to progress to the next sortie, the IP will debrief the
student's flight commander, if available, or any available squadron Ops Sup. Strong
consideration should be given to re-flying the sortie.
4.5.8. (Added) Make recommendations for additional training and which mission the student
should fly next in the comments and attachment tab. Some examples of recommendations:

     If an X-sortie is deemed necessary: “Recommend: Repeat BFM-4.”
If additional training is recommended: “Recommend: Accomplish intercept training in device
with an IP before repeating TI-3.”
4.5.9. (Added) The student's Flt/CC and SQ/DO or SQ/CC should mark either “CONCUR” or
“NONCONCUR” in the “edit reviews” sections of the Gradebook. If “NONCONCUR” is
AETCI36-2205V6_LUKEAFBSUP 7 AUGUST 2013                                                       13


indicated then alternative recommendations will be made to the IP of record, that section will be
re-written and the gradesheet will be re-submitted.
4.6. (Added) GTIMS Gradebook Syllabus Attachments
4.6.1. (Added) The attachment tab should include, but is not limited to, the following: LAFB
Form 7, CAP Memo (if applicable), GRIM Memo (if applicable), AETC Form 6 (if applicable),
and AF IMT 174 (if applicable).
4.6.2. (Added) Counseling is required for a failed mission, several substandard missions, poor
attitude, substandard academic performance, G-tolerance problems, placement on CAP status,
etc. Flight commanders will closely monitor student progress to promptly identify substandard
performance. Document formal counseling using AF IMT 174. Unless exempted by paragraph
4.3.9, all counseling forms will be attached to the Gradebook.
