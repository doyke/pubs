8.1.4.7. (301FW) G-Awareness Program. The 301 FW G-Awareness Program is an integral
part of the flying operation. G-awareness exercises and Anti-G Straining Maneuvers (AGSMs)
will be conducted in accordance with AFI11-2F-16V3, AFI11-214, and AFTTP 3-3.F-16.
AGSM reviews and assessments will be conducted in accordance with AFI11-2F-16V1.
8.1.4.8. (301FW) VFR Entry Points. Pilots will remain clear of DFW Class B airspace when
operating in the vicinity of NFW or contact air traffic control for Class B clearance. Pilots will
use ―Eagle‖ (NFW 316/6.6) to enter the RWY 17 VFR pattern, or ―Brook‖ (NFW 190/7) for
RWY 35. Jet aircraft will cross these points at 3,000 ft MSL then descend to pattern altitude no
later than 4 DME (Distance Measuring Equipment). Be aware that prop aircraft and helicopters
may cross the VFR entry points at 1,700 ft MSL. Pilots may enter the VFR pattern at other
points with tower’s approval.
8.1.4.9. (301FW) Radar Trail Recovery procedures to include when flying VFR at night, will
be flown as follows:
Trail recoveries will be flown in accordance with AFI11-2F-16V3. Spacing will not exceed 3
nautical miles (NM).
At ―DECEL‖ (Deceleration) call, all flight members select idle power and slow to 250 Knots.
At ―Gear‖ call, all flight members will extend gear, open speedbrakes, and slow to 180 Knots.
Each flight member will slow to Final Approach Speed upon reaching 3 DME.
Reference the 457 FS Pilot Guide for Instrument Meteorological Condition (IMC)
Recommended Recoveries.
8.1.4.9.1. (301FW)      301 FW aircraft can fly VFR at night provided they maintain flight
following.
8.1.4.9.2. (301FW) When landing at night, pilots will fly the approach procedure that affords
the safest and most effective means for a pilot to determine both course and glide slope during
landing. When glide slope guidance is unavailable, pilots will fly the best available non-
precision approach.
8.1.4.10. (301FW) Overhead Traffic Pattern. Pattern altitude is 2200 ft Mean Sea Level
(MSL). Report ―Initial‖ or ―TAC Initial‖ at 4 DME and 2200 ft MSL. The standard direction of
traffic is to the west, however east traffic may be flown if requested or directed by tower. If east
traffic is requested, use caution for Meacham Class D airspace 2 miles east of NFW. Pilots will
be familiar with Navy pattern operations and terminology. This includes the ―delta pattern‖
which is a high pattern flown at 2,700 ft MSL over the field and will be used for holding or at
other times when landing is not immediately desired. Aircraft in the delta pattern will maintain
altitude and pattern ground track until cleared. The ―downwind‖ pattern is a closed pattern flown
at 1,700 ft MSL. ―High closed‖ is a closed pattern flown at 2,200 ft MSL. Weather required for
the ―high-closed‖ pattern is 2,000 ft / 3 NM.
8.1.4.11. (301FW) Normal Straight-in. Enter the pattern via assigned clearance or the VFR
entry points at 3000 ft MSL. For visual straight-in, fly appropriate altitude and ground track for
the approach.

8.1.4.12. (301FW) Pattern Re-entry/Breakout. Pilots re-entering the pattern will climb to
1,200 ft MSL prior to crosswind turn, then climb to 2,200 ft MSL, and proceed to a 4 DME
initial unless otherwise directed by tower.
8.1.4.13. (301FW) Simulated Flame Out Patterns. The NFW Simulated Flame Out (SFO)
airspace includes 2.5 miles west, 0.5 miles east, and 3 miles north and south of NFW. The
vertical dimensions extend up to maximum of 8,000 ft MSL. The 8,000 ft MSL High Key
altitude is within the Class B airspace. Prior coordination with Regional Approach, Navy
Ground Control Approach (GCA), or NASJRB Fort Worth Tower is required before climbing or
descending into the 4,000 ft - 11,000 ft Class B block above the field. Straight in SFOs for
training are not authorized at NFW.
8.1.4.13.1. (301FW) Weather minimums are 1,000 ft above requested High Key altitude and 5
miles in-flight visibility.
8.1.4.13.2. (301FW) The SFO is a 360 degree circular pattern with all turns flown to the west.
If instructed to hold at High Key, pilots will maintain the pattern ground-track and energy for
desired SFO parameters.
8.1.4.13.3. (301FW) SFOs at Lawton Municipal Airport. A letter of agreement with Lawton
Muni authorizes 301 FW pilots to conduct SFO training. Reference the 457 FS Pilot Guide for
SFO procedures at Lawton.
8.1.4.13.4. (301FW) SFOs at Robert Gray Army Air Field (AAF). A letter of agreement with
Robert Gray AAF authorizes 301 FW pilots to conduct SFO training Reference the 457 FS Pilot
Guide for SFO procedures at Robert Gray.
8.1.4.14. (301FW)    Local Hazards.
8.1.4.14.1. (301FW) The potential for mid-air collision is elevated due to the volume of
aircraft in the area and the complex airspace structure. Pilots will use added caution for VFR
traffic operating on a certified Visual Flight Rule flyway approx 5 miles west of the field
extending north along the west shore of Eagle Mountain Lake between 1,500ft and 4,500ft.
Aircraft operating in this flyway are not required to be in radio contact with NFW or Regional
Approach.
8.1.4.14.2. (301FW) Meacham field operates a flight training school with training areas over
Eagle Mountain Lake. These aircraft are often operated by student pilots.
8.1.4.14.3. (301FW) NFW Class D airspace: airspace extending from the surface up to and
including 3,000 ft MSL within a 4.5 mile radius of NAS JRB Fort Worth TACAN with
extensions north (4.9 miles) and south (4.8 miles) to protect localizer courses, excluding that
airspace which is part of the Fort Worth Meacham Class D airspace.
8.1.4.14.4. (301FW) Taxiway Charlie East is a known area of FOD potential. 301 FW pilots
will not utilize Charlie East unless thorough coordination between 457 FS operations and airfield
operations has been completed.
8.1.4.15. (301FW)     NASJRB Fort Worth Radio Communications. Navy controller radio
terminology differs somewhat from Air Force terminology. A Navy ―Glossary of Terms‖ is
located in Attachment 2. 301 FW pilots will be familiar with Navy terminology.

8.1.4.16. (301FW) Alternate Mission Guidance. Air-to-Ground missions loaded with live
ordnance will not accomplish alternate missions.
8.1.4.17. (301FW) Fuel Requirements. Divert fuel figures and recommended Instrument
Flight Rules (IFR)/VFR bingo fuels are listed in the divert data chart of the 457 FS Pilot Guide.
8.1.4.18.1. (301FW) Pilots will plan to land towards a departure end barrier with up to a 10
knot tailwind maximum. Otherwise, land into a headwind regardless of the barrier configuration.
8.1.4.19.2. (301FW)    When clear of the active runway, communicate land time to Ops.
8.1.4.19.2. (301FW)    Once de-armed, taxi back as single ships.
Section 8E Weapons Deployment:
8.1.5.1. (301FW) Falcon Range Procedures. Reference the 457 FS Pilot Guide for range
procedures and the Falcon Range website, for the latest range Notice To Airman (NOTAM)s and
target restrictions. The Falcon Range website contains range data including Target Area and
Airspace Maps, Target Coordinates, CAS Briefings, Threat Systems, Weapons and Laser
Scoring, Range Regulations, Scheduling and Contact Information.
8.1.5.1.1. VFR Arrivals. Pilots will contact Sheppard Approach to navigate through the
Sheppard MOA enroute to Falcon Range. Transition altitude is 14,500ft MSL.
8.1.5.1.2. IFR Arrivals. Coordinate with Sheppard Approach for hand-off to Fort Sill
Approach for IFR descent to the minimum vectoring altitude. Expect vectors to the west of the
Falcon Range restricted area.
8.1.5.1.3. VFR Departures. The standard range departure is a climbing left turn to depart the
range at 14,500 ft MSL to avoid the Sheppard One MOA. Contact Sheppard Approach/Sheppard
Area Monitor for traffic advisories. If unable to climb to 14,500 ft MSL due to weather, but a
VFR departure is desired, depart the range at VFR hemispherical altitudes at or below 7,500 ft
MSL.
8.1.5.1.4. IFR Departures. If unable to depart VFR, contact Ft. Sill Approach for an IFR pick-
up. Anticipate delays in the coordination process.
8.1.5.2. (301FW) Simulated Weapons Employment. With expendable stores (bombs, external
fuel tanks, TERs carted at the pylon, etc) loaded on the aircraft, simulated weapons will be
loaded (zero quantity) in the Stores Management System only on empty or
uncarted/unexpendable stations.
8.1.5.2.1. EXCEPTION: When loaded, captive Maverick missiles may be selected. The
Master Arm switch will be confirmed in OFF or SIMULATE prior to the first attack. Do not
conduct off-range simulated weapons employment with hung ordnance aboard the aircraft. Do
not conduct off-range simulated weapons employment with live ordnance (to include simulated
gun employment with a hot gun) aboard the aircraft. Simulated deliveries conducted outside of
restricted ranges, MOAs and/or IR/VR routes are limited to level attacks.
8.1.5.3. (301FW)       Air-to-Air. Local Air Combat Training is normally conducted in the
Brownwood MOA. The Brownwood MOA is subsonic below Flight Level 300. Area
description, restrictions, and frequencies are contained in the 457 FS Pilot Guide. The
Brownwood MOA is bordered by high density arrival corridors into DFW International Airport.
Strict adherence to MOA boundaries is crucial to avoid conflicts. Pilots will not exit the MOA

8.1.6.9. (301FW)      Weather Recall and Divert. The SOF issues recall/divert through
controlling agencies, contacting the flight on their inter-flight VHF, via the Gateway and, if
necessary, on Guard. Flight leaders, if able, will acknowledge recall/divert instructions by
contacting the SOF and relaying fuel status.
8.1.6.10. (301FW) Environmental Restrictions to Flight Operations. 301 FW flight training
operations are not permitted when steady state surface winds (forecast or actual) in the
training/operating area exceed 35 knots over land. If using over water areas, training operations

will not be permitted if the steady state winds exceed 25 knots or the sea state/wave height is 10
ft or greater. At the 301 OG/CC’s discretion, these guidelines may be exceeded on a case-by-
case basis, when operational conditions dictate.
8.1.6.11. (301FW)        Search and Rescue Procedures. The flight lead will normally be
designated as the on-scene commander and will attempt to establish communication with the
downed pilot and assess the downed pilot’s condition. The on-scene commander will mark the
downed pilot’s position, establish communication with command/control agencies, and relay the
pilot’s position and status. In no case will the on-scene commander, or any other flight member
stay below established bingo fuel, unless a new bingo is set based on an alternate landing
location.
8.1.6.12. (301FW) Out of Battery Arresting Gear. When the arresting gear is out of battery
(tripped) the following actions shall be taken:
8.1.6.12.1. (301FW) Aircraft shall be informed immediately that the gear has been tripped and
given the location. ―CALL SIGN, RUNWAY 17/35 ARRESTING GEAR OUT OF BATTERY
LOCATED 1250/1375 FEET FROM THE APPROACH END.‖
8.1.6.12.2. (301FW) Aircraft on short final (1 mile or less) when the gear is tripped will be
given a wave-off and set up for another approach to the runway.
8.1.6.12.3. (301FW) Tower shall not issue a landing clearance when the gear is out of battery,
but will allow aircraft to land at own risk provided there is no men/equipment on the runway.
―CALL SIGN, LANDING BEYOND THE ARRESTING GEAR WILL BE AT YOUR OWN
RISK, WIND….‖ If unclear about the Tower Controllers intentions or if time and gas is critical,
query the controller and inform them that landing will be made at own risk.

Terms—NAVY TERMS
BREAK LONG—Continue toward the upwind end and take interval on traffic reported by the
tower. Tower may issue specific breaking point based on traffic, i.e. ―upwind numbers, mid-
field, __ mile upwind‖, etc.).
CLOSED TRAFFIC—Standard Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) term to describe successive
operations involving takeoffs, landings, or low approaches where the aircraft does not exit the
traffic pattern. Not to be confused with USAF Closed Pattern.
HIGH CLOSED—Term used to describe traffic pattern typically used by USAF aircraft. USAF
aircraft use the term to request an inside/high pattern (3/4 - 1 mile wide/2200 ft MSL).
DELTA/DELTA PATTERN—Racetrack holding pattern overhead the airfield at 2700 ft MSL in
a clean configuration, right turns for RWY 17, left for RWY 35.
DOWNWIND—Traffic pattern leg at 1700’ MSL between 1 - 1/2 NM and 2 miles abeam the
landing runway, 150 - 170 knots and gear down for successive approaches.
FCLP—Field Carrier Landing Practice. Simulated Aircraft Carrier Pattern.
PREVENTATIVE CONTROL—Preventative Control is different from other airport traffic
control in that repetitious routine approval of pilot action is eliminated. Controllers intervene
only when they observe a traffic conflict developing. Most commonly used to issue landing
clearance to formation flights.

RE—ENTER—Depart the pattern to the west and report inbound as directed by the tower. This
term is normally used when the pattern is full and minimal delay is required before the tower can
accept additional aircraft.
REPORT NUMBERS—Position over the active runway numbers jet aircraft may be required to
report on an Overhead Approach. Term does not authorize break. After the pilot reports
―Numbers‖, the control tower will issue break instructions.
ROLL AND GO—Term used by non-fighter aircraft to indicate that a touch and go maneuver
will use a longer portion of the runway.
TAXI TO YOUR LINE—Once clear of the runway, approval is granted to taxi to the established
parking area via preferred taxi routes.
UPWIND NUMBERS—Runway numbers at the departure end of the runway. Used to specify
break point for overhead approaches.
