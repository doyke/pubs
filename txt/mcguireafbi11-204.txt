1. Procedures: The following notification procedures will be complied with:
    1.1. On loads at McGuire AFB. The Air Terminal Operations Center (ATOC) will notify the Wing
    Command Post (305 AMW/CP) when an on load of hazardous cargo is required on missions originat-
    ing at McGuire AFB. The Wing Command Post will, in turn, coordinate an aircraft parking spot with
    Airfield Management Operations (AM Ops) and Maintenance Operations Center (MOC).
    1.2. AMC Missions. Wing Command Post will also contact the following to relay outbound/inbound
    mission data for AMC missions:
       1.2.1. The Wing Command Post will notify the ATOC, AM Ops, Security Forces Control Center
       (SFCC), Wing Safety (305 AMW/SEW), Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and MOC of the
       estimated time of arrival and the estimated time of departure (ETA and ETD) of AMC missions
       carrying hazardous cargo.
       1.2.2. AM Ops will notify the Fire Department and Air Traffic Control Tower.
    1.3. Non-AMC Missions. AM Ops will contact the Fire Department and Wing Command Post to
    give ETA and ETD of non-AMC, hazardous cargo laden aircraft. The Wing Command Post will con-
    tact ATOC, SFCC, 305 AMW/SEW, Air Traffic Control Tower, MOC, and EOD (explosive shipments
    only) to give available information.
    1.4. The following information will be passed by notifying agencies:
       1.4.1. Aircraft type.
       1.4.2. Tail number and/or mission number.
       1.4.3. Call sign.
       1.4.4. ETA and ETD.
       1.4.5. Parking spot.
       1.4.6. DOD Hazard Class Division (HC/D).
       1.4.7. Net Explosives Weight (NEW).
       1.4.8. Whether the cargo contains flammable liquids, solids, or gases.
       1.4.9. Whether the cargo contains oxidizing or corrosive agents.

2. Parking Spots: Hazardous cargo laden aircraft parking will be in accordance with the following
guidelines.
    2.1. The primary HCLAs are HCLA 1 and 2, located south of the Lima and Mike taxiways intersec-
    tion. Aircraft with HC/D 1.1. and/or 1.2 or HC/D 1.3. exceeding 5,000 lbs NEW must park on
    HCLAâ€™s 1-7. See Attachment 2 for further restrictions. HCLAs 1 and 2 are restricted to aircraft with
    wingspan less than 170 feet.
       2.1.1. Caution: Explosive laden foreign aircraft (with 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 over 1,000 pounds NEW)
       will not be parked on the primary HCLAs when either HCLA 1 or 2 is occupied by a Primary
       Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF) aircraft.
       2.1.2. Foreign aircraft will be parked in an appropriate alternate location. See Attachment 2
       Note.
MCGUIREAFBI11-204 4 APRIL 2008                                                                           3


   2.2. When both designated Primary HCLAs are occupied, explosive laden aircraft, HC/D 1.1. and/or
   1.2. not exceeding 50,000 lbs NEW may be parked on HCLA 3. The 305 AMW/SEW will be notified
   when these spots are used.
   2.3. Aircraft carrying HC/D 1.1 explosives not exceeding 30,000 pounds may park on Lima taxiway
   (HCLAs 4-7). Aircraft carrying HC/D 1.3 explosives not exceeding 1,000 pounds or any amount of
   HC/D 1.4 may park on Hotel through Lima rows spots 3 and 4. Aircraft with HC/D 1.3 less than
   5,000 lbs NEW may be parked on Alpha, Bravo rows or Mike and November rows spots 2 and 3 only.
   Amounts exceeding 5,000 lbs NEW of 1.3. must be parked on a HCLA.
       2.3.1. Parking spots used for loading or unloading HC/D 1.4 explosives will be any spots autho-
       rized for 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3.
   2.4. When parking spot saturation (for hazard class division 1.1 and 1.2 explosives) is anticipated,
   AM Ops will notify the Wing Explosives Safety Officer at least 24 hours in advance. The Explosives
   Safety Officer will advise the Wing Commander if the situation cannot be controlled at Wing staff
   level.

3. Emergency Notification: Should an emergency occur on explosives laden aircraft located on HCLA
1 or 2 or Lima taxiway HCLAs 3 -7, arriving and departing aircraft will be routed or parked outside the
hazard control zone until the area is declared safe by the incident commander.

4. Specific Actions:
   4.1. AM Ops will coordinate parking spots for hazardous cargo laden aircraft with MOC and the
   Wing Command Post.
   4.2. EOD will maintain a standby posture upon notification of aircraft arrival, loading or unloading,
   and departure operations.
   4.3. MOC will:
       4.3.1. Coordinate with AM Ops for parking or pre-positioning of assigned aircraft in the remote
       hazardous cargo loading areas (HCLAs 1 and 2) for McGuire AFB originating onloads.
       4.3.2. When aircraft maintenance is to be performed on any aircraft with explosive cargo, the
       maintenance operations officer is responsible for compliance with TO11A-1-33, Handling and
       Maintenance of Explosive Loaded Aircraft. The 305 AMW/SEW will be notified prior to start of
       maintenance.
           4.3.2.1. Ensure that the aircraft is properly grounded.
           4.3.2.2. Ensure that at least one 150 lb Halon fire extinguisher is in position for each hazard-
           ous cargo laden aircraft.
           4.3.2.3. Ensure that maintenance equipment is parked with parking brake set and at a safe dis-
           tance from aircraft when not in use.
           4.3.2.4. Keep vehicles at a safe distance from the aircraft unless involved in loading and
           unloading operations.

           4.3.2.5. Ensure power units are properly positioned at a safe distance from the aircraft. Air-
           craft maintenance that will increase the probability of fire such as the use of flame or uncon-
           trolled heat producing device is prohibited.
    4.4. Transient Maintenance will:
       4.4.1. Coordinate with AM Ops for parking transient aircraft in the remote hazardous cargo load-
       ing areas (HCLAs 1, 2 or 3-7).
       4.4.2. Lead transient aircraft carrying hazard class division 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3 cargo to their parking
       spot with a "Follow Me" vehicle.
           4.4.2.1. Ensure that the aircraft is immediately grounded after engine shut down.
           4.4.2.2. For missions not serviced by McGuire AFB Air Freight, place applicable hazardous
           cargo placards and fire symbols at each wing tip, nose and tail of the aircraft. Note: PNAF
           Aircraft do not require fire symbols to be posted however; all other hazardous carrying aircraft
           will have proper placards and fire symbols as applicable.
           4.4.2.3. Ensure that at least one 150 LB Halon fire extinguisher is in position for each hazard-
           ous cargo laden aircraft.

           aircraft when not in use.
           4.4.2.5. Keep vehicles at a safe distance from the aircraft unless involved in loading or
           unloading operations.
           4.4.2.6. Ensure power units are properly positioned at a safe distance from the aircraft.
    4.5. The Air Terminal Operations Center (305 APS/TRO) will:
       4.5.1. Notify the Wing Command Post when hazardous cargo on loads are required on an aircraft
       originating at McGuire AFB. Pass all hazardous cargo information to the Wing Command Post
       who will, in turn, notify required agencies.
       4.5.2. Notify the Fire Department when loading or unloading conventional hazardous cargo
       begins and ends. For explosives cargo, the notification procedures will include the DOD hazard
       class division, hazard symbol, and NEW.
       4.5.3. Place applicable hazardous cargo placards or fire symbols at each wing tip, nose, and tail of
       aircraft. Note: PNAF Aircraft do not require fire symbols to be posted however; all other hazard-
       ous carrying aircraft will have proper placards and fire symbols as applicable.
       4.5.4. Keep all vehicles and personnel not directly involved in hazardous cargo operations away
       from the aircraft to ensure maximum safe operations.
    4.6. Security Forces (305 SFS) will ensure that:
       4.6.1. Aircraft are protected IAW applicable local directives. Security Forces Control Center
       (SFCC) is notified by the wing command post when an aircraft is to be sealed. SFCC will dispatch
       a security force member to monitor the sealing. The security force member will relay the seal
       number, via landline or in person to SFCC. Sealed aircraft will be provided random patrol cover-
       age. When an aircraft is not sealed, security is the responsibility of the aircrew or possessing orga-
       nization.
