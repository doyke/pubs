1. Overview. The key to successfully reducing damage to vehicles is placing responsibility
where it rightfully belongs on the operator and the operator's commander who are charged with
maintaining high standards of vehicle operator training and discipline. Consequently, using the
procedures set forth in paragraph 2.3 of this instruction, repair cost will be the responsibility of
the organization to which the operators are assigned.
 2                                                                   36WGI24-302 14 MAY 2014


     1.1. Goal: To reduce the number of vehicle accidents, abuse and incident cases and reduce
     the risk of personal injury or death while keeping the cost of repairs to an absolute minimum.
     Commanders are required to initiate internal investigations into circumstances surrounding
     accidents, incidents and cases of suspected vehicle abuse or incidents.
2. Roles and Responsibilities.
     2.1. Vehicle Management: The 36th Logistics Readiness Squadron (36 LRS), Vehicle
     Management section (36 LRS/LGRV), is responsible for identifying suspected accidents,
     abuses and incidents (Attachment 2). The 36th Logistics Readiness Squadron Transportation
     Manager (36 LRS/LGRV), 36th Logistics Readiness Squadron Fleet Manager (36
     LRS/LGRVF), or 36th Logistics Readiness Squadron Vehicle Maintenance Superintendent
     (36 LRS/LGRVM) will evaluate each case and validate each alleged accident, abuse or
     incident. They will be the final authorities entrusted with differentiating between accident,
     abuse or incident. Reporting damage to an Air Force, Navy, or GSA lease vehicle is the
     unit’s responsibility. Documentation and tracking of the accident, abuse, or incident damage
     repair is the responsibility of the Vehicle Management and Analysis (VM&A) section of 36
     LRS/LGRV. The responsible unit commander will be the final authority in determining if
     financial liability will be pursued.
     2.2. Vehicle Operator: The vehicle operator has the primary responsibility to prevent a
     vehicle accident, abuse, or incident. Any damage should be reported immediately to the 36th
     Security Forces Squadron (36 SFS). If off base, contact the Guam Police Department at (671)
     632-9808, or (671) 632-9811. Operators will provide a copy of the SF Form 91, Motor
     Vehicle Accident Report, to the 36 LRS/LGRV Customer Service Center (CSC) during
     vehicle turn-in. In addition, two copies of the SF Form 94, Statement of Witness, are required
     for GSA lease vehicles. The secondary responsibility rests with the unit's Vehicle Control
     Officer/Vehicle Control Non-Commissioned Officer (VCO/VCNCO), who should be
     inspecting the unit's vehicles periodically for unreported damage and ensure each vehicle is
     turned into 36 LRS/LGRV for repairs.
     2.3. Using Organization: Ultimate financial responsibility for vehicle damage rests with the
     vehicle operator's assigned organization. In cases where multiple Air Force, Navy, or GSA
     lease vehicles are involved and an investigation cannot determine fault, repair cost will be the
     responsibility of the organization to which the operators are assigned. Group commanders
     will be responsible for accuracy, review, and completeness of any report of survey (ROS)
     originating within their units. Nothing in this Andersen Air Force Base Instruction relieves
     an individual of personal liability under a ROS. See AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for
     Air Force Property.
3. Accident and Abuse Procedures.
     3.1. Upon determination of vehicle damage as a result of accident or abuse, 36 LRS/LGRV
     will:
        3.1.1. Open a vehicle repair estimate work order and take pictures to create an accident
        or abuse case file. As required, copies will be sent to the 36th Wing Ground Safety Office
        (36 WG/SEG) and/or 36th Wing Legal Office (36 WG/JA) for review.
36WGI24-302 14 MAY 2014                                                                        3


     3.1.2. Send a vehicle accident/abuse report/notification letter, along with an estimate of
     repairs, to the operator’s commander to initiate an investigation. As the liaison between
     their organization and 36 LRS/LGRV, the VCO/VCNCO will also be notified.
     3.1.3. Include a copy of the accident report/notification letter to the 36 WG/SEG. If a
     GMV was involved in a fatality, caused a fatality or an accident with private property, the
     36 WG/JA must release the vehicle before repairs can proceed.
     3.1.4. If the estimated repair cost exceeds the vehicle’s "one-time repair limit," the
     vehicle is considered uneconomically repairable and will not be repaired. However,
     exceptions may be made to meet mission critical needs. The 36 LRS/CC and/or HQ
     PACAF/A4 determine these exceptions, depending on vehicle type. Once determined, the
     repair cost will be provided to the 36 WG/SEG.
     3.1.5. 36 LRS/LGRV will be responsible for recovering all non-drivable GMVs or
     contact a reputable towing company for such service. The initial responsibility to identify
     and report accidents rests with the vehicle operator.
     3.1.6. Maintain accident or abuse repair information for a 12-month period.
  3.2. Assigned and using organizations will:
     3.2.1. Ensure a viable vehicle accident prevention program is part of the unit’s safety
     program.
     3.2.2. All GMVs involved in an accident, or found to have damage not previously
     reported (Abuse/Incident), must be brought to the 36 LRS/LGRV CSC section as soon as
     possible, but no later than the next duty day, so damage assessment and initial repair cost
     estimate can be accomplished.
     3.2.3. SF 91 and DD Form 518, Accident Identification Card, must be completed and
     provided upon vehicle turn-in to 36 LRS/LGRV. The vehicle will not be considered
     reported to maintenance until the vehicle and both forms have been submitted. 36 SFS
     must ensure the name and rank of the 36 SFS Defender responding on scene is listed in
     block 81 of SF Form 91.
     3.2.4. Commanders have 10 calendar days after the vehicle accident or abuse notification
     letter has been received to conduct an investigation, gather the police report, ROS data (if
     required), take pictures, and provide a release letter (Attachment 3). An email containing
     the same data specified in Attachment 3 will suffice as a release letter. 36 LRS/LGRV
     will open an accident or abuse repair work order and begin repairs upon receipt of all
     required documents. In some circumstances, the 36 WG/JA will be required to review the
     case and release the vehicle for repair.
     3.2.5. Commanders may initiate a DD Form 200, Financial Liability Investigation of
     Property Loss, investigation into the circumstances involving any accident or suspected
     vehicle abuse case where gross negligence is suspected. If the investigation reveals an
     operator’s gross negligence was the proximate cause of damage to a vehicle, commanders
     may assess pecuniary liability for the repair cost in accordance with AFMAN 23-220,
     paragraph 8.6.3.
     3.2.6. Accidents and abuse case statistics will be reported and tracked by 36 LRS/LGRV.
4                                                            36WGI24-302 14 MAY 2014


    3.2.7. Report U-Drive-It or loaned vehicle damage to 36 LRS/LGRV within 24-hours.
    3.2.8. Initiate a ROS for Air Force property in accordance with AFMAN 23-220 if
    willful negligence is substantiated. Note: The investigator cannot hold the position of
    VCO/VCNCO.
    3.2.9. Commanders disagreeing with the findings of liability may appeal to the 36
    LRS/CC within 10 calendar days from notification. Additionally, intent to appeal must be
    coordinated with VM&A. If the 36 LRS/CC does not support the appeal, the appeal
    package will then be forwarded through the 36th Mission Support Group Commander (36
    MSG/CC) to the 36th Wing Commander (36 WG/CC) for final determination.
